{"text":"I love Liquid Lounge at Aria - it's much smaller than any of the other pool parties but that's what I love about it!

It's a much more intimate setting and the service at the daybeds and cabanas are the best I've had in Vegas. The food served at the pool is top notch.

If you want a debaucherous party, this may not be your cup of Jaeger. If you are looking for something a little more upscale where only 500 people are going to see you topless, this is the place to go.

Fun!"}
{"text":"They play hip hop! Another small intimate pool party! Good food, service and monitors!"}
{"text":"This place is great for the 30+ crowd. If you do not like a completely wild scene but appreciate an awesome DJ Lineup. . . this is the place! The pool can get a bit crowded and quite costly for the cabana but if you take a seat at the tables for sit down and order up some food that is totally the way to go! We ordered the mini tacos which were the bomb."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday, my friends all slept in 'til 2pm so I was on my own. I was looking for a good pool with good people and I found it here.

The staff was very friendly and attentive (Josh, Nadene, and Brian - whose Celtics just couldn't put it together :) ).  The kobe burger was excellent. The drinks were strong. And the people were not only gorgeous but down to earth and easy to talk with. The smaller pool helps initiate conversations. 

At one point, around noon, I counted 15 or 16 beautiful women and 4 guys (myself included).  It picked up around 2 but still had a good ratio. My friends blew it while I had a great time. =)

The property itself is top-notch, very clean, and very modern. All around a great time and well worth it."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!!  My friends and I bought tickets to enjoy the pool party for my birthday.  It wasn't until we went through the most intense security I have ever been part of, did we find out that if we wanted to sit down on a day bed or even sit on a chair we would have to pay extra.  We were told we could sit pool side and when I sat down in the ONLY space big enough for 3 of us, security yelled at me to get up. This should have been mentioned somewhere online when you buy your tickets - in order to sit down you have to pay EXTRA.  We weren't the only ones fooled, 3 guys spent $90 to get in and had the same issue. 

If you want to enjoy this pool party, be prepared to pay a lot of $, which I know is how Vegas does it.  But what pisses me off is no mention of what your actual ticket gets you once you at the pool. 

And when I called Hakkasan group for my money back as I was dissatisfied, I was told no refunds.  I guess there is no such thing as customer service anymore."}
{"text":"My now husband and I have made quite a few Vegas trips together living in Newport Beach. He used to travel here all the time for work too so we can pretty much entertain ourselves anywhere. The Liquid Lounge may be the first place we left within 1 drink and 20 mins. Might as well be Kindergarten with the rules... Couldn't even have a towel or shoes with you if you didn't buy a bed. I mean seriously I felt like I was putting my things in a cubby and asking for permission to go to the bathroom in order to wear shoes! Apparently these are the CEO's rules so I guess we're never coming here again."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!

They took my credit card and loosed it, they requiring to have it taken when you order more then one drink, later i found out someone actually used it, i won't be surprise if its one of their employees, just worst shady bad experience i have ever had!

You got that?? they taking your credit card, it required for getting drinks to you, but they have it somewhere unsecured. 

When I asked to get it back they didn't find it.

When I started to get upset was worst experience ever, just shady answers, made me feel like I did something wrong ***they*** loosed my credit card.

they don't care about their customers at all, we asked to speak to a supervisor, when he finally showed up he was so rude we regret we even bother.

The biggest problem was they didn't let us go anywhere because we had open check of over $2000, but I wasn't able to pay it because they didn't find my card!!

my friends had to figure the check out.

Later I found someone charged my card, I bet one of their employees, so I had to contact the credit card company and deal with all this mess after Vegas trip.

They don't belong to Aria Resort, when we complained about them to the Aria we been told they are independently owned.


We spent there over $2000, it was 6 of us.

accept that we had good time before all that happened, but its not worth it, go somewhere who appreciate your business, somewhere who will not try to steal your money .

They just don't deserves anyone's business, i will never go back!"}
{"text":"This is how a pool party should be. Daybed mins are reasonable, beds can have 8 comfortably, service was excellent and pool was clean and DB free. We had a daybed and ordered food as well which was all good tasting and served hot....
Definitely would come here over others like Tao Beach, or EBC. 
EBC= overrated IMO."}
{"text":"If you want a Vegas pool with a cool vibe, beautiful people, great menu, and sick music, go to Liquid"}
{"text":"This pool was a great time. My friend was unable to get into Wet Republic because he didn't have swim trunks, so we headed over to Liquid instead. We were handed free passes by a promoter on our way over to the pool. We arrived at about 1 pm on a Friday. It took about 5 minutes to get in to the pool. I liked that there was a free check in area for all of our belongings. The pool was on the small side, but they did play a good variety of music. They have a pretty good drink special that comes with a souvenir cup too. Overall, the crowd was friendly and ranged from early 20's to a few 40+. Highly recommended for a laid back, fun pool party."}
{"text":"Huge thanks to James Rhine for being the best host possible.
A last min trip to Vegas and with his help, he made sure we have the best time possible. 
Liquid was great! Great set up, vibe, music and people. 
I'll def be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had a daybed with a group of my friends. We had a fantastic time! The music was the best we had for the entire trip to Las Vegas. This was because this place didn't only play house like other Vegas spots. 

The guys at the door were nice. You can get comped admission just by being in the Lobby of Aria and talking to promoters who hand cards out.
The only con is if you come in that way, you wont get to sit anywhere except the group. The place is all daybeds and cabanas and you have to do minimums to sit in one.

Other that that, I could come to this spot each day of my trip."}
{"text":"I had a blast here,, went last Summer around August. I can say I did have a day bed on the water surrounded two really, really, good looking groups of girls.  The music wasn't all techno so I liked that.  Not a big pool but really fun."}
{"text":"Went twice on Memorial Day weekend. It was a BLAST start to finish. The door was busy, but they were super polite and got everyone in as quickly as possible. Music was fantastic, service was on point (chicks were super hot and friendly) and James Rhine was extremely accommodating (also easy on the eyes.)  I would definitely recommend checking this spot out!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Came for a friends bachelor party. We had bottle service in a good area near the DJ. The place was packed and the pool itself was a good size. 

Waiters were attentive and dj was playing good music."}
{"text":"Stopped by Aria during EDC weekend to aid my hangover from Marquee and WOW this place was rockin! We saw Cazzette performing and everyone seemed to be throughly enjoying themselves. They offered ok deals on drinks. $30 will get you a huge 32oz margarita in a souvenir cup which was  enough to keep me feeling good for another couple hours and they provided free bag checking. I haven't been to any other pool parties so I'm not sure how rowdy other crowds get but security was pretty on point at this venue (almost too much they stopped people from dancing in certain areas.) Definitely will be coming back although I really would like to try Encore Rehab or Wet Republic first."}
{"text":"Liquid is a lovely small, intimate venue. Unlike TAO Beach, which packs them in, the number of guests seemed very controlled. And unlike Rehab, where people go to get wasted, the vibe is very mellow and relaxed. The pool is clean and cool and it's a great place to relax after a few nights of partying. I highly recommend purchasing a daybed and a pitcher of their watermelon drink. The frozen fruit, although a little odd at first, is also very refreshing in the summer heat."}
{"text":"Worst pool ever NEVER going back!!!! We were with a big group of people of all races. Of course the girls walk in first which were mostly all white then all of the guys walked in behind us the guy checking IDs said to my brother in law who's African American/Hawaiian \"look at me, open your eyes! You're not getting in happy birthday!! \" and walked away. When asked why we couldn't get in, instead of coming up to us and talking quietly he yell across everyone and said \"HIS BIRTHDAY IS ON 4/20 AND HIS SHIRT SAYS 4/20 HES NOT COMING IN PERIOD!!! \" He was such an ass! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Favorite pool party. Not uber-trashy like some others (cough Wet Republic cough) and not ridiculous packed like some others (cough Rehab cough) -- this smallish pool and lounge area is the perfect mix of cozy day beds, a shallow pool, great DJ (who takes requests! yay!) and really phenomenal service- everyone from bouncers to waiters to hosts just make you feel like you VIP from the moment you walk in .... can't complain!"}
{"text":"EXPENSSIVE FOR NOTHING! You have to realy wanna blow some $$ to be seet that you blow some $$$.

Men $20 Women $10 to get in. To \"rent\" a seat MINIMUM in food and drinks $100/chair!"}
{"text":"So,  got my son tickets for Liquid,  he shows up and is told he needed 'upscale swim wear\". (He's a great looking guy,  tall, muscled. .but,  his board shorts aren't expensive enough? ?)

 Now,  we are from Santa Barbara,  and he spent most is his life in board shorts. . But apparently,  that is not good enough for liquid.(but they didn't/couldn't explain what upscale swimwear was exactly) . And what sucks. . There is NO REFUND on the tickets.. I did read the reviews on here,  but only after I had purchased the tickets. . So the reviews were spot on about the bouncers being jerks. ."}
{"text":"Came here twice. The first time I came, we were informed that despite the ad saying local girls were free, there was a charge. We opted to leave and come back the next week. This time we got in free but the staff inside were extremely rude and unprofessional. We were asked to move from our spot on the ledge about 20 minutes after settling in (and watching the employees stand around doing nothing). Basically we felt like we weren't welcome. We took our business elsewhere. I took a lot of pictures which kind of shows you how long we'd been sitting there before we were asked to move... The pool is gorgeous and we'll try again when we're feeling less insulted."}
{"text":"Attended an after party for BlogWorld here and had a blast. Tons of giveaways (scored myself a Kodak zi8) and free drinks. It was awesome! And the DJ (Greg Lopez) was the best I've heard out of all the Vegas trips in my lifetime. This would be an ideal place to hit up if you're not into the bigger pool parties (i.e., Wet Republic, Rehab, Tao Beach, just to name a few). Still, like any other place in Vegas, it's likely to draw a crowd.  And if you're seeking to secure a spot inside the pool, good luck with that. It's pretty dinky compared to the ones I've seen at other hotels."}
{"text":"i wanted to catch some sun so i went downstairs with my friend to check out the pools.. walk past a couple pools to the other side and there's a short line already.. guestlist even for aria hotel guests? we got there about 11 and the line took forever.. there were only about 10 people ahead of us too.. daybeds were going to $100 when we first fell in line.. i went to the bathroom and when i got back they raised the price to $150.. if there was a good dj i knew spinning then we would've put down the money for one.. good thing we didn't bc when we got inside about 30min later, the pool lounge was empty! why? bc everyone that was in line ahead of us left soon after entering.. the pool was tiny and dj was just ok.. the only thing good about this place was that there was free champagne for ladies from 11-1.. i def took advantage of this and passed mine along to my friend before waiting a few min for refills..after a few trips to the bar i got another glass of champ and we were allowed to pour it into a plastic cup (classy, i know) before leaving the lounge.. total time spent at liquid- no more than 30 min.. we just went to the reg aria pools and that was good enough for me..i made a few trips back for the free champagne and didn't have to wait in line bc i still had my stamp..

i would only come back if i was staying at aria, the free champagne, and if a dj i knew was going to be there.."}
{"text":"Liquid is the perfect pool party for a group of people who want to rent a day bed and drink. It offers a much better experience than the typical Wet Republic pool party that is absolutely packed. 

Bottle service was obviously over-priced but... it's Vegas. This was completely expected, and if anything, we were blown away by the fantastic service. The alcohol was served with a ton of mixers that were replenished frequently. Our waitress was so cute and accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience!

The DJ was good - the pool is a bit small, but the overall space is a decent size. I was staying at the Aria, so it was super convenient and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went there for my Birthday with some friends. It was on a Saturday so they had a DJ and that made it sooo much fun!! The staff members seemed  to all be friendly and happy. 
I was not super satisfied with the food especially with that price tag, but that was expected. 

5 star service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an upscale pool party lounge at one of Vegas' best resorts and casinos, Liquid Pool at the Aria is the place for you. For reservations contact 516-987-2549."}
{"text":"I've been to liquid pool lounge twice. The first time I was less than impressed because I was not expecting the pool to be so small and the area to be small in general. They don't have a lot of locker space, so if they run out, you're left with putting your belongings on the floor. Luckily my friend got a table so we put our stuff there. The DJ was great last year when I went (3lau was playing - one of my favorite DJs) so it was a great time. I just didn't enjoy the venue and the vibes as much as I did at Marquee. I was quite reluctant to come back here this year, knowing that I could go to another pool party. However, Illenium was playing and my group wanted to see him. My second time here was a way better experience! We got there early enough so we were able to reserve some space on the pool side. There were a lot of space to dance in the pool and by the DJ booth. A group who had a day bed right next to the pool were really nice and let me dance in their area, so the vibes were much better this year around! I honestly think that whether you have fun or not here is all up to you. I was completely sober and had a lot of fun dancing by myself! The main reason for the 3 stars is just the venue itself compared to other pools on the strip :) Whether I will be back or not will depend on who is playing at the time. I had no issues with security or even with wait time for both the times I was here."}
{"text":"I would have to completely disagree with Nicole B.'s review of Liquid.  Liquid is NOT a wannabe Wet Republic.  The two have very different objectives, and its very apparent.  Wet Republic is 100 times larger than Liquid and is more of that Rowdy, Crazy Party environment.  Liquid is much more relaxed and low-key.  As for the no seating comment, Uhhhh RESERVE A CABANA OR A DAYBED OR A CHAIR, DUH! They are actually quite reasonably priced.

On a Saturday, the Lounge chair at Liquid is only $100 and it includes food and drink for up to $100.  The Daybeds were $300 and could comfortably fit 3 people.  What I love about reserving this is that they have little storage containers where you can put all of your belongings, as well as a bucket to keep your champagne, or beers or whatever you drink cool.  The food they serve here is pretty good as well, for poolside.

If You are looking for a REHAB, TAO BEACH, or WET REPUBLIC type of atmosphere, this is NOT the place for you!!!  LIQUID is much smaller, but still has a great DJ and relaxed vibe, but still very fun! I will most certainly return and reserve a Daybed because it is WORTH it!  The only negative is that the hours vary and sometimes they close early so make sure you check the hours before coming here."}
{"text":"They're very strict. I had my ibuprofen with me and wouldn't let me in. So I had to leave it outside. The crowd was boring. Very stiff. It's expensive. Mostly young, in shape, Caucasians. If you want to party and have fun go to The Sapphire Day Pool. I went here after liquid lounge and had a ball."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday afternoon so there was no pool party to review. No cover charge and you could pretty much occupy any chair or daybed for free. The atmosphere was chill and most people were just tanning, except for one or two groups near the back partying it up in their cabanas. 

There's a designated area to dine in and the food here is really good! They also allow you to eat by the pool, but it was so hot that the servers suggested we stay under the shaded tables by the bar. I had the kobe beef burger and it was amaaazing. So juicy and the sauce they use is delicious! It also comes with an onion ring inside the burger, a side of chips, and a big ass pickle! I also got to try some of the mahi mahi tacos, which were great too, but a bit too soggy. Portion was large (3 tacos) and they're very generous with the chunks of fish :)

One odd thing though was apparently they don't serve tap water to you at the table? Our waitress only offered us bottle water when we would've been fine with regular water...but we were directed to walk across the pool and retrieve it from some fountain or something? IDK, but we didn't bother and instead forked over the extra money for overpriced FIJI."}
{"text":"Service at Liquid pool lounge -- F. The place was completely empty on a Monday, and thus we were the only ones to rent a cabana in the whole place. The waitress was cute and nice enough, but her assistant had a rude and bad attitude, and the bouncers / managers / whoever they were chased us down like criminals when one in our group walked out of the place with one of their towels. Are you kidding me? We were a group of 10 30-something professionals and gave them close to $2000 in business on a completely dead, empty day, and they wanted to raise a huge fuss over someone walking out with a towel? Damn, I knew times were tough, but THAT bad that they were willing to treat their guests like trash after all the money they had just made on us? Maybe the heat was going to their heads...."}
{"text":"Liquid is not for everyone.  If you're not interested in the hoards of people that party together at Rehab on Sundays, and you prefer to relax in a more quiet setting with less people, then Liquid is just right for you.  Not much goes on at Liquid and the drinks are very expensive.  It was $8 just for a bottle of water.

Also, the staff here is kind of rude and so I don't recommend wasting your time here.  The Aria pool is just as nice and much bigger."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars you say? Well for one I got in for free on a Sat. last week. Two, this place is hot! The club at Aria Haze is nothing compare to this you actually have A LOT of attractive people that come here, (no offense) especially the girls. Ladies, make sure your two piece looks great on you and you have hot sunglasses to match bec. that is all I saw when I went. This place is much bigger then Tao beach and not to mention a lot cleaner. For the most part the set up is great one main pool and beds all around it. I would say one draw back is that they only have one bar but that is the norm for these fun in the sun pool parties. Oh and at least the day I was there the music was awesome top 20, OG SHIT and even some tight B-sides. All in all I do not think you will be disappointed especially if your a dude."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Liquid on my last two visits but my third was a bubble burster.  I was here last Sunday and it wasn't an insane party like the first two times.  It wasn't dead but it wasn't poppin' off either.  Since it was less busy, they offered us daybeds at $50 food/bar tab minimum and included my man's cover charge.  Waitress was really sweet and service was attentive.  Resident DJ was pretty good.

Ordered:
-pitcher of mojitos, $60
-hot wings, $16
-coconut shrimp, $19
-Jack & Coke, $15
-Corona, $9
-Margaritas, $15

Everything was pretty good.  And the bonus for guys is that the place was literally 95% women, since ladies get in free.  The ratio was like 6 girls to every 1 guy."}
{"text":"I had a great time here on a Sunday last summer. Hali took care of my girlfriend and I, and we had a bed for the day with a relatively low minimum. The place was definitely more of a \"lounge\" than a wild party, but I enjoyed it since I was still tired from the night before. The food is really, really good (I had fish tacos, girlfriend had coconut shrimp). Definitely recommended if you can get a reasonable min."}
{"text":"Idk wasn't that cool. Seemed way to small and damn the prices are stupid. Had a hot staff but I'm not sure if ill be back"}
{"text":"Rude. Douchey. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"All the starts are purely for the security, they weren't your typical security & they were very nice & patient with my friend & I because we couldn't get ahold of our party so they let us go anyway, Rachel was very sweet & nice & A guy(forgot his name) seen we were getting annoyed with our situation & was patient & let us go in to find out friends"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing day here celebrating my husband's birthday with about 20 friends! They are very strict about the rules to get in, so check what is allowed before you go - but once you are in, it is a great time!! Shout out to Nick, Gabby, and Bernard for making our day fun and memorable!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences of my life. My wife and I were treated like second class citizens. As a guest of the Aria hotel, I expect a little civility when asking a question of a member of the staff. Four bouncers were standing around and when I tried to ask what time the pool opens, is there a charge, is there a waiting list and then I was ignored, and the people behind me were ushered in. It is very simple if someone asks a question answer it. 

All other experiences I have had at this hotel have been wonderful, the rooms, casino, and food service have all exceeded my expectation. The Liquid Pool Lounge is owned by the Light group who I assume pay a concession to the Aria Hotel (MGM International) in order maintain this facility. Aria, the Liquid Pool Lounge is dimming your stars.

As a professor of Hospitality Management in Florida, I will be using this as an example of what not to do.

Nathan"}
{"text":"When you get to the entrance the people at the door are the rudest most pompous ass people that will ruin your day by treating us the 40yrs old couple staying at the hotel like we under age little kids ... Not worth the money trust me stay away from this loosing setup ..... Unless you want to be treated badly"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend for my best friends Bachelorette party, and as MOH I wanted her to have the time of her life. 

Liquid was by FAR our favorite pool!! Super clean and definitely more fun compared to the other pools we had gone to. We got a cabana right next to the dj booth and danced our butts off all day! 

Our server, Brandi was amazing! Super friendly, fast, and made sure we had everything we wanted. She even recommended some apps for us to snack on (keep us going after a few drinks ;) ) which came out in the perfect amount of time and were delicious! 

The security guys (at a different pool the day before) had been total jerks to us. Which made us nervous about the rest of the weekend...The security at Liquid changed everything. They were VERY nice and didn't make us feel uncomfortable at all! We got through and made it quickly to our table.

I would recommend going to Liquid over the other pools any day! THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR THE INCREDIBLE HOSPITALITY!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a cabana at the main Aria pool but were offered entrance into Liquid with free vodka drinks until 3PM and a daybed next to celebrity who shall remain nameless.  

We got into Liquid around noon and it was pretty slow.  Since there were in and out privileges we went to and from our main cabana and here... with the free vodka... why not? 

The place seemed to start getting busy around 2PM, but the place was never super crowded... which was much to my liking. 

The free entrance was a bit weird.  We were given wristbands for the free drinks, but when we got to the door they said without the \"card\" to get in, we'd have to pay $20 each.  Since one of the promoters were there, he gave us cards and they made it seem like a big deal that we got cards saying \"okay... now that you have cards you can come in, but normally it's $20.\"  So the \"cards\" to get us in were literally in our hands for less than a second... my girlfriends and I just thought it wasn't necessary.  I mean... they already gave us the wristbands and told us to head over for free drinks and they give us a hard time to get in, yet they give us a daybed for free... it just wasn't consistent.  

Aside from that little randomness at the front, the place is nice, clean and not too crowded.  The group there was definitely more of a party crowd than the main Aria pool so it was nice to go from one scene to another."}
{"text":"What happens when you go to Vegas with a group of nurses? You splurge! Work hard--Play harder!!!

We originally had free passes for the pool party. Once we got there the pool was so packed ( it's only medium size and it was freaking hot), we decided to buy ourselves a day bed, which had a compartment to place clothes/phones/etc. and huge umbrella. We also did bottle service and pitchers of cocktails (cucumber lemonade was the bomb!, even their pina colada was decent)

Had so much fun playing voley ball in the pool. Played a mean match. 

Yes I can say, I once lived the baller life."}
{"text":"This is a small and intimate pool but my group of five had such a wonderful time here when we came in June. They are quite picky at the door in terms of what they let you in with (they didn't allow us to bring in our selfie sticks) but I understand that it is for our own safety. The music was great, the drinks were amazing and the prices were reasonable. The food was also pretty good. The tall blonde security guy at the door by the towels was very friendly and funny so we appreciated that.  We also got a cabana for a great price so we were happy about that. My only complaint is that the waitress always took a very long time to come back around to us, even though the place was not too busy and is not big. There were plenty of other waitresses so we were a bit confused about where she was all the time. Despite that minor mishap, we will be back here again."}
{"text":"Yikes! Was referred here by a friend. Not sure what he was seeing.  I stayed 90 min and paid $20 on a prime Saturday.  Lord...what a joke.  Smallest ass pool in world filled with some of the nastiest chicks and dudes.  Only salvation was GoGo dancers on boxes.  

The setup is hilarious..you have nowhere to put your stuff but other than to check everything with a lady like a coat check..oh yeah, want to start a tab with a waitress? You need to have a lounger otherwise it's to the bar only. Good thing I asked all this before settling in...

Beach balls flying around like you are inside the Powerball machine.  Um, I'd like to chill and have a beer not get smashed every 20 seconds with a beach ball/dodgeball.  

I tried my best to deal but my time in Vegas is much better spent at other classier spots."}
{"text":"This was the saving grace for Lighthouse group during the recent Yelp Elite conference. The staff here was friendly, welcoming and pleasant to see Yelpers at their pool. The pool was a great day out, lots of energy, excitment and the item checkin service is great as there are no beds or chairs unless you pay a lot. This is Ok though as you are there to be in the pool...

I will say though before the entry man I knew I was with Yelp, he did not give me the time of day and made it clear I was not getting in and the guest list was closed for guys. Boom, show him the email from his employer and he becomes mr nice guy. This would have been a 5 star if he just showed basic respect from the start."}
{"text":"Sleek and sophisticated. Youre pretty much required to spend $50 a person on drinks and food because the only way you can sit and relax is if you reserve a lounge chair which comes with a $50 minimum. 

The service made up for it though with the pool boys attending to your every need, even fixing your towels! 

We chose to sit in the shaded area to avoid sunburn and when we asked to be moved to the sunny area because it got cold, they kept giving us the runaround about the chairs that were there were reserved and not available, when no one even showed up. 

The infinity pool was cool, but the pool toys were the worst idea EVER with drunk d-bags throwing them everywhere and splashing everyone with the water guns. People would hit the beach balls an they would go flying everywhere knocking over drinks. 

The pool toys need to go. Three stars for service and scene, minus two for required $50 minimum and pool toys."}
{"text":"Edited: Give them a couple days when trying to make reservation. They will get back to you. There were also very nice to help book other events you're party is planning on attending so you wouldn't have to go through various channels. 


I have been trying to reach someone to make a reservation for a future date for the past week and a half now. I've use the website and filled out the required information. Someone named Darren Berg got emailed me with a price list of all the VIP options to which I responded to reserve. I still haven't heard back from anyone since then. I called the number on the email, no answer. My boyfriend called the number on the website to which he was referred to another person who would \"get back to him within the next 24 hours\" but no one did. I don't know what the process of making a reservation for them is but this is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Let me just say that the security team there is rude as hell with the exception of 1 guy. We were having so much fun until it was time to leave. Yes, as previous reviews mentioned the pool is small, but the vibe was good! We decided to leave at 3pm because we were there for EDC and had to get ready. Walked out of the pool and my bag was stolen. I will say it was partially my fault for leaving it out, but that's typically what everyone does. I never thought I'd step out to find it gone. Well, i report it to a security that was actually sympathetic and nice. He then said i needed to speak to the security manager at liquid. Understandable, but when we walked to the front they said the manager was busy dealing with a bigger issue. So we waited... he gets there and is just plain rude as were the rest of the security team at the entrance! Gave me a business card and said call later. When i asked him to check the security footage he said they will later. Really?? Later?? The person who stole it could've still been in there! I finally talked to Aria security  (not associated with Liquid security) and Kelsey was very helpful! I was able to track my phone and see that it was still inside Liquid! This whole thing took 3 hrs of my own investigating. Kelsey personally walked up there and went inside liquid. 10 minutes later she walks out holding my bag! She was amazing  (again she is NOT associated with Liquid). Very disappointed with the way Liquid handled the situation. I had my personal things in that bag including a few others ID's. My whole weekend was almost ruined due to their lack of due diligence!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint. Not too many choices as far as seating. Bar is efficient, though"}
{"text":"Great people watching and a place to lay low and relax. Expensive drinks and the service was spotty where we were at. Maybe it was the location but we tried to get the waitress for about 30 minutes and 3 times the waitress we flagged down said she will get the waitress for our location, but she never came.

Great pool and fun to people watch. But the high prices for drinks and spotty service got them -2 stars. Perhaps you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"You know what, Liquid is alright with me!! They were handing out free passes at the entrance, and if you \"liked\" it on Facebook, women got a free drink.  Unfortunately, the signal was pretty bad, so I couldn't connect to Facebook, but that was okay.

When we arrived, the music was not working! Oh no!!  The host said that there was a power outage, but it should be back on soon.  We were contemplating leaving, but we were able to negotiate a good deal on a daybed (just $250 F&B minimum for our group of 6), so we decided to stay.  Sure enough, the music came back on in about 15 minutes. Yay!!

This was definitely my speed, as far as pool parties go. Nice atmosphere, not too big, not overcrowded, but still a fun crowd. The dj was decent, and the staff threw a bunch of beach balls into the pool, so a lot of people were throwing those around. You just had to be careful not to get hit in the head!

Drinks were pretty pricey, with their \"specialty\" cocktails being $15 each. You could, however, buy 32 oz drinks in a Liquid sports cup (that you keep) for $30.  One note- the Watermelon cocktail is VERY sweet. I like sweet drinks, but this was even too much for me.

Service was friendly, and we had no issues with any of the staff. For a more relaxed, but still entertaining vibe, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Typically, at each resort in Las Vegas they have a calm and relaxing pool, and a hip - party pool. I usually stay at all the MGM affiliate Hotel and resorts. I have been to Liquid before when Adam's cousin and her fiancé stayed there. They had a suite there so we had access to everything cool the Aria has to offer. We decided to bring ourselves to Liquid. When we got in, there was no where to sit unless you had a daybed or cabana. They said that you could purchase one. We decided to purchase one between the four of us and got to lay down, enjoy the DJ, get our drinks brought to us, and also ordered food. Obviously we ran up quite a tab. It was a great time, however I didn't like the fact that you did not have an option to get the bed. Otherwise, if you do not have one there is no where to sit and really no where to go. If you do plan to go to Liquid, go there with the intention of spending some money. Of course, if you're in a large party it would probably not be too bad to split it, but if it's just a few of you I hope that you are able to know someone there, because it can get expensive. If you are a platinum member, you will not need to wait in line, nor should you have to pay. Otherwise, if you don't get in before 2 PM they sometimes charge the guys. Unless it's a holiday weekend it shouldn't be too tough to get in. The DJ is good, the drinks are good, and the overall ambience is good. I don't know if it's worth all of your money, good. But I've always had a good time there."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the free champagne until 1pm and then we peaced out to find something more our style. If you want a nice peaceful day poolside then this is not the place to go.  If you're looking to show off your bikini body, party, and spend lots of money then this might just be the place for you!"}
{"text":"Worst security out of all the pools. Im in vegas monthly and will never go back. Venus and bare 500x better. Dont waste your money get a bed or cabana at bare and venus or even marquee.  Better use of money and loyalty"}
{"text":"For what it is, Liquid really excels. The problem this \"exclusive\" pool faces is that there are so many others in Las Vegas to compare it to, and thus people wind up making poor comparisons to things which aren't really alike. If you're planning to come to Liquid because you think it might be similar to the atmosphere at TAO Beach, Encore, Wet Republic, or other similar mega pool parties, then save yourself the money and the subsequent public whining, and just go to those places. I wouldn't quite call this space intimate, because there are still a couple hundred people here on a busy day, but it's definitely smaller in scale and goes for a more luxury appeal (appropriately situated at the high class Aria resort).

The main Aria pool complex is pretty huge, so it's no wonder that more people don't try to get into Liquid, but it also explains why the promo ladies are constantly out patrolling with more free passes to get people in. Despite what some of the other reviews might say about \"being cute getting you nowhere\" here, I saw several ladies getting in for free. We personally got in free along with quite a lot of additional stuff thanks to a friend of ours who works for the company, but I would have rated Liquid the same without all the complimentary stuff.

For the particular day I visited Liquid was exactly what I needed, a smaller spot to hang out with my friends on our day bed (which has a nice storage compartment for your belongings as well as multiple ice buckets for champagne, liquor bottles, mixers, and bottled water), listen to some pretty good DJ tunes, quickly add to the lingering buzz from the night before (with extra help from the super expedient service staff), and get a lot of bonus eye candy from the podium dancers. There are several points during the day where the DJ encourages everyone to splash the hell out of the pool though, so just be warned you might get your precious hair wet.

While our immediate waitress and pool boy (or whatever these guys are called) were superb in their execution, the door staff did leave most of us with a bitter memory of Liquid. They are completely unnecessarily dickish here and definitely do not offer an inviting atmosphere. At one point Vidal left to get money from the ATM and come right back to tip the employees, only to get flack from one of the bouncers who quizzed him repeatedly before finally allowing him to return. I had the same thing happen to me when I went upstairs to the room to get my sunglasses and returned without my ID (which was poolside). My arm was clearly stamped for re-entry, but he felt the need to give me the cold stare down and accompanying inquiries... sorry mate, I don't budge for anyone, let alone Pool Patrol."}
{"text":"I LOVE CHAMPAGNE FIRE DRILLS! 

Champagne fire drills are the best fire drills I've ever experienced!! 

The drill goes something like this:
1. Hot girls in skimpy bikinis surround the edge of the pool
2. They blow their whistles and scream CHAMPAGNE FIRE DRILL
3. They shake up bottles and make it rain champagne
4. You trot over to the hot girls, open your mouth wide, and they pour champagne down your throat
5. Rinse and repeat every few hours

Girls, get on the guest list and you won't have too much trouble getting in free. Also, girls, free champagne until 2pm! 

Everyone else:
Small pool, great music, cool scene!"}
{"text":"Liquid pool is inside the aria. The decore is far from creative and gives off a stale cold vibe. It's a very fake astophomere. So if you aren't a local armature head somewhere more up beat and less stiff."}
{"text":"This is a great pool party!! The people who take care of you are Anthony and if you need great reservations call Marshall S. at 3166503182... Yes! I know the number by heart bc he is the truth!! I love Liquid :-)"}
{"text":"Wed. Slow. Big goons at the door wanted to hassle me over my purse & the SEALED travel packs of ALEVE I had. I'm not paying over-priced cover & drinks to listen to a crappy dj if they're going to be so ridiculous@ the door. Get over yourself.... The Aria pools were just as nice & not pretentious."}
{"text":"I love this pool party! It's clean, intimate, and not overcrowded! I came to LV from LA for my bachelorette party. The first thing I noticed as I was being lead through the crowd to our table res was how attractive the crowd was. I was shocked!! Our table was next to the DJ. Perfect location and kept us out of the crowd. The staff was friendly, attentive, and gorgeous! The pool was warm and fun and didn't gross me out. Usually I don't go in the pool but it was so hot I had to cool down. This place is clean clean clean!! The bathrooms were as cleaner than you'd expect for a pool party. They had staff in there cleaning at all times.

There is a wait even for table reservations so get there early as they get busy on weekends. I got there around 12:30. They look through your purse and bag. No food or drinks from outside. But sunscreen is allowed! That's an important thing for me! Don't bring bachelorette toys as they usually won't let that stuff in. I did see someone with a small penis squirt gun, so maybe they let small items in. Haha!

Thank you Liquid staff for the \"Team Bride\" recognition. That was fun and a great photo op for my crew. Looking forward to coming back. Big thanks to James! You're the best!"}
{"text":"10/7/2010

I LOVE VEGAS!  Ok now that i got that out of the way, this was my 1st time attending a vegas pool party. Thursdays seem to be exactly what I need on a Thursday after traveling 5+hrs to vegas.  Not too crowded, good blend of music (reggae, hip-hop, house), great drink specials 3$ Patrone...WHAT! and of course some nice eye candy.
Pool was kinda small but I wasn't planning on swimming laps anyway...I will be back"}
{"text":"This pool party/lounge is a bit small compared to the others in Vegas that I've been to.  However, not bad to just chill and relax.  Love their pineapple mojito!!

Lost my phone at the bag check and the security guard picked up my call after a few hours the place was closed and returned it to us!  Thanks Calvin!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  First off the staff was very standoffish and almost rude.  Once we entered the pool we were turned loose to fend for ourselves.  After wandering around to only find reserved lounge chairs we asked where we could sit.  We were then informed that the cheapest seat was $300.  That would have been nice to know when we arrived.  As it turned out we had enough time to see that the place was filled with young guys partying...very few females.  We decided to go back to Moorea Beach Club for a 2nd day."}
{"text":"The pool is a little awkward at first.  There was an open champagne bar until 1pm which was VERY nice, but there was barely anyone there and the music wasn't loud. Then out of nowhere (it seemed) the music got louder and the pool was full of people!  It was so fun and beach balls were being thrown from everywhere.  There is a locker available if you don't have anywhere to put your things.  We were promised drink tickets that we never got but after the open champagne bar, we didn't miss them. Fun pool & fun crowd!"}
{"text":"My girls and I LOVE liquid!! Their host Darren Berg is awesome and ALWAYS makes sure we are having a good time when we are there. Super fun spot especially if you're going on weekdays :-)"}
{"text":"It is hard to believe this place is so popular. It is a big sweaty mass of men standing around in a dirty pool drinking severely over-priced drinks.  Cheesy & gross. Skip it."}
{"text":"Decent pool for some relaxation. I like the way it's handled, the different areas and all."}
{"text":"This was a great pool party. If you're looking for a Wet Republic or Rehab kind of environment this is NOT it. The pool was on the cleaner side for the pool party scene. I actually got in. It was not over crowded and the crowd itself was not rowdy. Their sweet potato fries were to die for. The drinks were pricey, but they were well made and the bartenders were friendly and efficient. We received free passes from a promoter \"baby usher\". I that you can check your things in, so that they're not lying all over the floor. The music was great and there were beach balls everywhere.

This was a very relaxing and fun experience. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised by Liquid. Walking in I was a tad afraid I was going to walk into something you see at TAO beach. Thank God it was nothing of the sort. 

They never over packed the place so there was always room to walk around and have your own space. It felt somewhat like a relaxed day at a really nice pool, alas there were still a few crazy people who are doing all the wrong things in a very public place. Seriously, do they know we're staring at them not bc they're hot but instead a hot mess? Children, we are in Vegas that doesn't mean you still don't have a last name that your mom/dad would very much appreciate you not putting to shame. 

Grandma set aside, Liquid is a place you go for some good music (a DJ spins) and good food!! I'm not lying when I say their mahi mahi tacos were one of tastiest I've had. I promise if you try them they won't disappoint. Only issue is that they make you eat it at the bar, I'd rather eat it where I'm sitting so I can take my time. I had to throw out one of the taco's bc I didn't have space in my tum. 

All in all the decor is pretty and the place is new and fresh so if you're feeling in the mood for drinks and music by the pool I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Liquid is one of the lesser known pool parties in Vegas. Located at Aria, Liquid's best day is Thursday due to their drink specials..... $5 Patron and $3 Corona!  This is quite dangerous as the drinks kept flowing and was pretty thoroughly trashed by 4pm on a Thursday!

I do not know how much was cover cause like before, JC has got it hooked up! We got a comped daybed thru Peter Kolizeras which eventually turned into 2 daybeds since no one showed up at the one next to ours!  

Perfect start to the weekend! Cheap Drinks, Hot girls everywhere! :D"}
{"text":"Awesome day pool lounge. Music is really great, drinks well mixed. I wouldn't go into the pool it's a bit too small and crowded but really good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I already have a cabana booked for an upcoming date at the regular hotel pool at Aria. So I thought I'd see what was available at the Liquid Pool as well.

Apparently, for Liquid, you can't book through concierge, you have to contact the Liquid host directly.

I went to the Liquid web site, filled out the questionnaire and sent it in.  Within an hour I received the following e-mail reply from a Marc Kmetz at Liquid:

        \"Feel free to contact me at your leisure to discuss Liquid pricing/options.\"

That's all that was written in that e-mail.

There was no \"Good morning, Mr. Mike G.\" nor \"Thank you for considering Liquid as your vacation destination.\"

Plus, I already contacted Liquid \"at my leisure.\" It's their job to give me a call if they want me to spend my money there.

This is starkly different from when I booked a cabana through the concierge. I spoke with him on the phone about pricing and availability, and I received an e-mail confirmation within minutes.

Then I checked the Yelp reviews on Liquid. All I can say is, I'm glad I'm not taking the risk and spending my money in Liquid.

And as for Mr. Kmetz . . . You, sir, should take some management, public service or public relations classes. What a turn-off your cold, unfriendly, and unprofessional e-mail response was."}
{"text":"This is a very chill day club... and I can appreciate that, for the days I don't feel like going hardcore (see Encore Beach or Wet Republic). The time i came here, was to warm up for my Vegas trip, so start with something light. Aria's Liquid was a good choice for that, since we were staying here. My group walked right in and instantly was offered a complimentary daybed, so thank you! Had a good time mingling with peeps and chillaxing!"}
{"text":"After an incredibly disappointing experience at Wet Republic, we found ourselves at Liquid. Defeated, hungry, and drained from 111 degree weather, we lowered our expectations and gave Liquid a chance. This day club is located at Aria. It is definitely not as big or popular as other day clubs. Jennifer D's promoter was able to walk us in without any hassle. 

The crowd is definitely a mixed one, however a really fun one. I met a few friends from Texas in the pool. Everyone is obviously here to: #1) look good but also #2) have a good time. Even though the pool was fairly crowded, if someone accidentally bumped into me, they would almost immediately apologize. Not an aggressive or rowdy crowd at all. 

The music featured DJ Shift the day we were there. Loved that he played more hip hop than EDM. It was a good change from most of the nightclubs and kept us dancing the whole afternoon. 

Other day clubs have some planters or random areas where people will (at their own risk) store their clothes and belongings. There's not really anywhere to do that here. So if you don't have a cabana, plan on renting a $30 locker to hold your things. 

Since we hadn't eaten anything all day, we ordered food from the bar. Nachos and curly fries. The toppings on the nachos were surprisingly fresh, but other than that it was standard bar food. Only downside was not really having a place to eat. We stood at a reserved table and thankfully they kicked us out when we had essentially finished our food. 

Would I come back? If the opportunity came up, but I'll keep the memories of a super fun and successful Saturday afternoon here."}
{"text":"I had fun here.  I really did.  But the staff is so annoying.

We got yelled at three times in a row for having our belongings by the pool.  I understand that they don't want to have liability issues, but I need my sunscreen and I'm not going to be devastated if someone steals it.  Plus, how do you expect me to pay for my drinks if I'm expected to tip the (incredibly rude) bag- guy every time I have to get my money?  He actually said to us \"You know, the expected tip is $10\".  Umm...no.  And he wants that every time we have to get it?

Basically, everyone here needs to chill out.

On the other hand, I did have a great time and it's much more laid back than the other pools, but it still has a party vibe.  The pool is a small, but decent size in comparison to some of the others and everyone gets inside to splash and just have fun."}
{"text":"A good sized pool lounge, yes it's a lounge with a small pool in the middle, a few cabana areas around, there are some tiny plunge pools in cabana areas as well, they looked more like tanks to me actually. 

We skipped the long line a little past noon on a Saturday cause we had friends throwing a small event there. The bag check was very strict, much more strict than regular pools at Aria. Absolutely NO any type of medications, not even the over the counter ones like tums, band aids, eye drops, Advil or even hand sanitizers! Of course no outside water, beverage, food or alcohol allowed, so put everything away before going in, or they will just take everything and throw them away! 

We ordered bottle of Grey Goose, the pineapple mixer was exceptionally good! I drank so much of it with goose vodka! Also had some appetizers later on, the lobster tacos and shrimp cocktail were so fresh and delicious. Our servers were very attentive and friendly, took really good care of us the entire afternoon. Funny thing was the bartender at the bar asked for my ID when I tried to order a drink and charge to my room, but the other waitress didn't ask for hubby's ID when he ordered bottle of Grey Goose? What's up with that? They needed ID for a 30 bucks Mai Tai, but not a bottle of 500 bucks Goose vodka? It didn't make sense! 

I am not really into pool parties, I don't do well in heat, it wasn't even that hot that day, but I still got really dehydrated afterwards. It was fun time, good music, good crowd, all the single guys left me and my gf alone once I told them my husband was just over there. But no dancing on the tables or having my gf dancing on me, NOT allowed at all, thought this was sin city! Whatever!"}
{"text":"I think this was one of the best times I've ever had!  Liquid feels like a spa and has a very relaxing atmosphere.  There were nine of us in a large cabana up by the private wading pool and we had a wonderful waitress named Dani and another attendant named TJ - I'll make sure to ask for them both next time I am there.  We started with bottles of Patron Silver, Grey Goose, and Stoli Orange and managed to polish off several more throughout the day with the help of a dozen fine young ladies.  This is the place to be if you're looking for great service and a relaxing atmoshere (not a pickup joint).  Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"This place was so unorganized and such a pain in the ass to deal with. Nick who claims to be the manager was so rude to my bachelor party and wasn't helpful at all when I offered some suggestions. I will definitely not be back- nor will I suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place gets hella crazy! Everybody is drinking and having a great time but you might also see people puking around. Staff recommended for me NOT to use the lockers because there's constant theft of phones and wallets. Plus they're around $40.  It's cool for the first 3 hours but after that I WAS OVER IT. Music is good! Super crowded though, sardine status. Drinks are $35"}
{"text":"Where to even begin.... first off they confiscate or throw out all outside food and beverages including gum and drinks bought at the other pool in the hotel! Then there is absolutely no where to put any belongings or towels besides on the edge of the pool where they get soaked to the point of it being worse than no towel and then security came through and told us we would have to check our bag for $30 unless you were PHYSICALLY wearing it in the pool at all times. The music was good but it was not a crazy pool day party, you weren't allowed to jump around or do anything fun besides hit some inflatable beach balls back and forth. Probably most surprising is how tiny the whole area is, there were less than 20 beds around the pool but you had to reserve them before hand for a substantial fee and they were the ONLY place to sit besides in the water. The staff wasn't attentive unless you had paid for the beds. And last but not least for a nice resort like the Aria there should be a better view or at least some scenery, instead it feels like you are in a small walled off corner."}
{"text":"Being cute will not get you any perks at this place! People at the front door are really rude, and the pool is much too small. It only gets 2 stars because the drinks in sippy cups are delicious. 

I had a comped day bed, which I was very grateful for, but I showed up late to my reservation due to trying to locate some loved ones who are deployed after hearing about the recent accident in Afghanistan. I completely understood not getting the free day bed and expected to pay since I showed up so late, but the promoter who was \"hooking me up\" yelled at me like he was my father. When I tried to explain what happened, he said \"Your story has no bearing on my decision.\" Power trip, especially because I was with 14 of my girl friends, and all of us were extremely polite. We were about to pay for a day bed, but after walking in to check out the place, decided it was way too crowded and sweaty. There was literally no room to move in the pool. 

Instead, we hung out at the regular Aria pool and had a blast. If you're looking to go to a Pool Party, I'd recommend Encore Beach instead! That one was awesome. Liquid, step up your game."}
{"text":"They first time I ever came here, I had an amazing experience! Great drinks, good music, nice pool. Fun times! 

Fast forward a year later on Memorial Day weekend and it's a completely different story! Of course my sister and my friend(male), and myself (female) are on a guest list for the day party (males and females free before 3p...perfect!), because here we are 1 hour before 3p... well not so perfect because

 #1 they say friend can't come in because they wasn't feeling his short (apparently they didn't fit the Liquid definition of swim shorts) 

# 2 after explaining to the security that the shorts were recently purchased in the store and labeled as swim shorts, we advance in the long line to the ladies that check you in... uh oh guess what! It's a $50 cover for my friend (cuz he's a guy) even though it's nowhere near 3p... we debate but according to the pretty lady \"It's subject to change\" ... so friend exits stage left because he felt it wasn't worth $50... So now frustration is growing. 

#3 FINALLY we get to the front where security is to check bags... I happen to have a small fanny pack with not too much in it... so I thought...well here goes security pulling out two sealed packages of over the counter Advil and tossing them! I'm hella confused but I guess dumb ass policies are in place for a reason. 

Now we in, YAY! 

Packed! DRINK YUM! $45! BOOOO! We chilling out. Enjoying our time, vibing. Then I see the security guy the tossed the \"drugs\" out of my bag earlier walk by us, I figured he's working the inside now.... see him pass by a few more times.... 

We get invited up to the private cabana section, YAY! FOOD YUM! DRINKS FREE! private not crowded pool AWESOME! Next thing I know...

Look who's up in the private section now \"securing shit\" the same security guy that was once outside, then walking around inside, now conveniently walking around the private section... 

30 mins or so later me and sis take a dip... and look who see hovering over us... you guessed it! Security guy! Now he has words, something to the tune of \"where is your cabana\" I tell him the number cabana we are in, then he tells us we have to get out of the pool, and out of the section if we don't have a special stamp! 

Now I'm hella confused because last time me and sis came here we got a cabana and there was no specific stamp for the section... we play nice... we exit the pool... we have security guy talk to the person who invited us to the cabana (he had the EXACT SAME STAMPS WE HAD) he tells security guy we with him... now security guy is \"understanding\" but we ready to exit stage left! 

So if you like looong ass lines
Being lied to about pricing 
Over priced drinks and food 
And over the top security that pretty much stalks and harasses you.... 
Please go to Liquid pool lounge in Las Vegas! 
(If you read this entire review... thank you!)"}
{"text":"Kinda gross. Pool party with the smallest pool...
More like a cesspool of bacteria. If you go, go wasted. They took away my chewing gum at the front door. Weird. Not my scene."}
{"text":"This place caught me by surprise...

I was expecting a ton of techo music and a so so crowd so I didnt go the first 2 days I was in town. Sunday we went to get a cabana at the normal pool and they were sold out so we got one at Liquid. Very very VERY nice cabanas with 2 plasma's, AC, fridges, 2 day beds, your own sound system, and great service. Not to mention the private pool up by the cabanas is great because the normal pool is insane.

The music was off the hook. The DJ was mixing ODB into 80's and really set the mood. I was looking around and seeing everyone just dancing and having a good time screaming.

Good times Liquid !!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I bitch about being a woman but in Vegas it's wonderful being one! Oh how I miss my Canadian friends from Liquid.

Can I just say that this place is strict! No outside food or drinks (even waters) they make you throw it all away.

Tip is if you hide your crap away from the cameras on the side in a bush so you can retrieve it all later. 

They also do not allow piggy back rides in the water, don't we all piggy back ride in pools for fun?
And this is an adult only pool? weird.  

Squirt guns and the beach balls were fun to play with inside the pool. 

The pool is small I can imagine when it's crowded how packed that pool gets.

Super friendly people lounging around and in the pool. 

The Go Go dancer are a plus, music was perfect, not to loud. 

The waitress was a snob, wouldn't bring me water I had to order it at the bar. 

Good Times indeed! 

RANDOM FACT: 
Liquid Pool has 8 grand private cabanas."}
{"text":"Are you SERIOUSSS Aria?? Might as well have a pool party in my backyard! I thought this was a joke. The day we came was I think the 2nd day this pool opened and my love Benny Benassi was spinning..that didn't take away the fact that we were in a kiddie pool water felt like it stopped at my belly button......awkward. The walls made me feel all claustrophobic like a backyard fence and the pool just needed a diving board to look like anyones backyard! Hehe

However, a good amount of ppl were there. One star for the good pina colodas and another for the pretty crowd!

I'd either be back for thursdays or wet republic it!"}
{"text":"Definitely a lounge and not a day club.  So don't get that twisted (i.e. don't expect big banger DJs, the hottest people, etc.).  That being said...

+Ambiance.  It's cool and slick looking.  Very modern even though it's small.  Love that there were little toy water guns everywhere.

+Drinks and food.  The drinks they had were delicious!  And all of us thought the food was great too.

+Easy to get in BUT

-NO WHERE TO SIT if you don't do bottle service.  Don't come here if you're not going to pay for it.

-Service.  I'm mixed about this.  Our server/waitress/lounge maid (whatever they are called) was great.  She was really helpful and checked on us a lot.  However the guy who let us in was not very accommodating and we almost walked out.  But for 13 people for $1k (Day bed & 2 lounge chairs), it was worth it.

-SMALL!  It's small

Anyhow I had a great crew so I still had a good time.  Good to chill with the homies, but not to meet people."}
{"text":"Good vibes, smaller pool but leaves for a intimate atmosphere.  Appetizers are good and served fast.  Private pool for parties gives a deprecate little pool and cabana which is perfect for an ultimate pool experience.  You can party in the main pool with people yet have a smaller pool to wind down or just have a few friends or even boyfriend, so you get the beat of both worlds.  You have a place to put your things and can still function with the main event!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on my birthday for the GTA pool party. We were on a guest list so it was nice that we didnt have to pay. One of my friends dropped his ID in the car and had to run back to the car to get it and the employees were nice to let him back him if he mentioned my name.

The pool wasn't too big, which was fine with me since not as many people as I thought were there. I really liked how they had those cute donut floaties! Girls got free champagne from 11-2. We did give some to our guy friends (whoops!) and they had to pay $34, which probably included a penalty charge. So boys, if you're in Vegas, expect yourself to ball out, sorry!

There was one point in the party where everyone had to get out to clean. This took about two hours and I was getting hot. I did kill the time by dancing but I honestly just wanted to be in the pool again. Also we arrived at noon for the free champagne... GTA got on around 4pm and we were all getting hungry so we didn't stay too long for the set unfortunately.

Overall I had a lot of fun and would come back again if the occasion calls for it!"}
{"text":"Great place to party on a Fri or Sat. Our group had a daybed, and the service was good and fast.
Your bottles get poured into plastic carafes so it's easy to over pour.. Friendly waitstaff and zero douche factor. A little smaller venue, but they have a great vibe and solid mix of top 40 and edm."}
{"text":"I've been reading some of the other reviews and perhaps we just got lucky but my group of friends went to the liquid day pool party and it was epic!! We had such a fun time dancing and drinking and falling off that stupid white un-rideable floating pool swan. I'm sure the staff was annoyed with our shenanigans but they were gracious and patient no matter how many times they had to ask us to stop standing on tables . I think if you go get a cabana for sure or a table by the pool so you have a place to sit and put your stuff. That seemed to be the common complaint. 
Regardless I think we still would have had fun!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here - we did see DJ Pauly from Jersey Shore dj. He played a lot of old school hip hop which I am a big fan of. I had great company, drinks and food. Pool was a decent size and it was not too overcrowded."}
{"text":"we got a late start to the day, so we got here after noon.  In the future I would suggest you get there earlier to enjoy the FULL spectrum that Liquid has to offer.  Thanks to a hook up from a host me and my friend didn't have to pay to get in, and the people ahead of us in line had just gotten turned away.  The DJ was good, people were actually in the pool, the pomritas were AWESOME, the food was ok.  PS - they make ladies keep the tatas covered, so I can't give it 5 stars.  Also, they have bag check so you don't have to stash your bag by the speakers."}
{"text":"went here on a Saturday, this place is pretty small, the atmosphere had more of chill mellow vibe, total opposite of Rehab, couldnt really get wasted and \"rage\" here when the dj kept playing music like hey soul sister by train, also no drinks in the pool and you cant be at least 10 inches close to the steps in the pool. laaame..

we were in a cabana with landon donovan, too bad I didnt realize that until I saw that he was playing in the world cup :/ oh well...we left after we finished our drinks and went to beach club at encore, we had a great time there ;)"}
{"text":"Was here twice.  Once last year and again just last week.  I have to say the first time around last year was a lot more memorable.  I love the vibe here.  It is a smaller pool party scene.  Nothing like Encore Beach Club, Wet Republic, Ditch Friday's @ the Palms, or Rehab- this place is much smaller.  The vibe is pretty chill and chic last year.  Lots of beautiful people soaking up the sun and everyone just having a good time.  Very intimate feeling.  I like the craziness of lots of people but sometimes you just want to chill and be surrounded by beautiful people.

Last week was not so chic.  It was a Hotel guest crowd.  Old and overweight people soaking the sun dancing to house music. Odd and weird and kind of killed the sexiness of what this pool party could be but oh well.   Can't really hate it since it was the opening week for pool parties in Vegas and I am sure all the pretty peeps have not arrived in Vegas yet.  I am sure the crowd will get better.  Encore Beach Club was the same that week too.

Overall, I can't be hating because summer has not offically started.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas and hit up the pool scene in July!"}
{"text":"Considering I've been to Wet Republic (my fave big pools) and Bare (my fave small pool), Liquid is aiiiiight! Which is funny cuz my friend had a cabana here and despite that, I wasn't impressed. lol

The pool is really small, especially compared to the lounge itself. I mean, we prolly don't go to pool parties/lounges for swimming but, what is this...a baby pool??! They expect people to, literally, dip their feet in the water and that's it??!! lol

If you're staying at Aria, JUST STAY AT THE ARIA POOL...bigger pool and more space for lounging; and still just as much hot bodies to stare at!!!!!"}
{"text":"i'm actually sad that this pool has so little visitors. but its really nice here but a little on the small side. the servers who work here are really nice and not pushy at all for you to get drinks. for $15 some of us girls got different drinks such as mango pina colda, pina colada, mango daiquiris and they were all well blended and good. we even had a hook up from kevin \"ice man\" for reservations for dinner and for 20% off too. its good to be a girl in vegas. it was also a nice touch that when we were in the pool, they came over to bring us glasses to put our cameras in just in case we spilled water or drinks on it. and another plus was coming over to help us fold our clothes and create more room on the couches we were on. definitely good customer service!"}
{"text":"we had the worst experience in this liquid pool at aria ever. the personnel by the entrance think they are gods. it's a joke. we will never recommend this place and will discourage people to cometo this stupid place."}
{"text":"I recommend reserving and getting a day bed here if a couple or few people.

You'll have places to put your stuff while you get in the pool, with a very shortened wait, and it's just nice to have a space to layout and relax away from the throng of people.   Get there early 11am for the best daybed spot you like.  Your bar minimum will not be cheap, just keep that in mind - but if you're spending 5 hours there, it's worth it.

Captain Morgan girls nearby gave us free drinks and shots all day long.  That was a nice touch - don't expect that though.

Pool is small compared to something like Wet Republic - so if you want a more crazy, party wild scene, go to Wet instead.  This would be more chill, but certainly busy once 1pm rolls around.

I thought the service was excellent (ice always replaced to keep the beers cool).  

Thanks guys for a great time."}
{"text":"It's gettin HOT in here, so take off all your clothes... rewind! 

We had 2 huge group of friend partying together on a particular Saturday afternoon for the pool party celebrating a Bachelor and a Bachelorette party! Of course we had to get a cabana, otherwise it would just be painful. It would definitely be a 1 star experience if you didn't have a cabana. 

The waitresses were all super HAWT, all very \"full\" in the front and in the back. And they all wore these super cute, translates to small, bikinis while serving the customers. We had 3 girls come help us with drinks and they were all super cute and friendly. The music was great, we were all dancing for several hours. 

Bathrooms were very clean and nice, and well maintained. The crowd was high energy but no one was obnoxious, just having a great time! Definitely lots of fun!"}
{"text":"Pool was small, security was nice and reasonable, the thing I hated most was paying over $1k for a table and the umbrella gave shade to less than 30% of the table but the workers were nice enough to move the umbrella to the other side. Bottles start at $550 and pitchers at $95. Expected from a Vegas day club. We also ordered the chicken platter which came with about 15 pieces of chicken, curly fries, 4 Texas toast, and blue cheese and ketchup for $80. Decent amount of food for 8 ppl we each ate about 2-3 chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"So it was the Friday morning of the AOD Invasion, and I was faced with the decision of either relaxing at the luxurious Encore adult pool or party my ass off at Liquid. Memories of girls getting carted off in wheelchairs still reminded me that it takes a bit of endurance and party swagger to get through a day at this place. I checked with Team Encore, and they wanted to.. PARTAI. So I had no option but to tough it out. 

I texted Hali that we are coming down and she said no probs. We walked through the corridors of Aria and through the hotel pool and found ourselves at this massive line that ran around the concrete wall. The last time I came here on a Thursday there was actually no line, so my first thought is that 2011 Liquid is more popping then ever. Boy was I ever right! 

I got up to the front and waved Hali down.  She quickly had security put aside the ropes. She asked me how many and also how does the daybed next to the DJ booth sound? We all thought that was a great location. Also our JC member/Mood director of Liquid Pearce Cleaveland will be working there the whole day to cater to all our partying needs. 

We got in and got settled, and our daybed had a great view of all the mayhem that was going on in the pool.  Without having a chance to even put my sunscreen on, Pearce came by with a round of shots for our entire group. Some of the girls couldn't finish the shot so I had to handle it for them.  

I got a chance to roam around and hang out with the AOD members, and everyone was having a good time.  Pearce kept giving shoutouts to the AOD crew at the pool and random strangers saw my AOD dogtag and would come up to me and ask what it stood for. \"Bro is this YOUR party?\" \"Yes this is our party, and we are taking over.\"

I don't think I ever got a chance to make it to my daybed without stumbling around this place. Pearce stopped me to do a shot (could've been 5 shots, it was a solid pour from a bottle). People were snapping pics. \"What the first pic didnt go through?\" \"Do it again!\" \"Shit\" So I had do this shot twice: http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/247987_202342743143052_100001019834956_520740_3390033_n.jpg

All in all it was a great day. If we needed an umbrella at our daybed, Pearce made it happen. If we needed more alcohol Pearce made it happen. If we needed someone to get already clinically insane people to get more crazy, Pearce made it happen by giving shoutouts over the mic to all the AOD members. 

I knew it was 5pm when I saw members passed out at random places and getting escorted out. People were dancing then falling over chairs and I had to pick them up. I started drinking water so I can save myself and not be a causality in the evening. The party doesn't stop at the pool for an AOD member, but I can't say Liquid didn't do a number on me. 

Shoutout to- Hali Tendler host at Liquid for making this location happen: http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/255024_202006046510055_100001019834956_518394_4043552_n.jpg
Also Pearce Cleaveland for keeping the party going. I now know what a mood director does."}
{"text":"This is a wanna be \"Wet Republic\".

This place doesnt compare to wet republic at all because it is entirely too small!
I know people who have backyards that are bigger than this place!

We got in for free and only stayed for about 10mins so I dont know how much it costs to get in. There was limited seating and the drinks weren't strong. The DJ was also wack!

We had a better time hanging out in the regular hotel pool."}
{"text":"Was here Friday and here's 4 reasons for 4 stars:

~ Awesome music!  Not too loud but certainly helps get you into the day-party mood!

~ Excellent service....I got to pick my chair, the staff was super friendly, and I never waited too long for drinks.

~ Great crowd...this may vary day to day but it's a plus that Liquid doesn't pack people in....there was room to breathe and mingle.

~ Everything is new, cool, and trendy.  This place beats the other admission-only pools...if for no other reason than it's brand-spanking new.

The one downside?  It's a freaking act of Congress to get in this place, even without a line. Come early.  Come early and be patient."}
{"text":"This is probably the place everyone needs to check out if he or she in Las Vegas and want to  party like a .
Thanks to a kind man that show me and my sister how to have fun it was awesome pool party with beautiful people!! The only thing is the water problem!! I needed to pay 11$ to a tiny bottle of water... besides that I felt like I can dance until tomorrow, they had lit DJ and good vibes"}
{"text":"Checked this place out recently and it's pretty nice considering the size.  It gets crowded but only if you decide to get away from your table. Plus it is a new hotel/casino therefore everything is nice and clean here. The crowd is just ok but hey you gotta make the most of it!"}
{"text":"I'm not into super loud and super crowded pool parties in Vegas so Liquid was perfect because it's not that big. It still got crowded by mid-afternoon but it's not like we were uncomfortably bumping into people. Love the chic, modern feel of this place. Even though we had a daybed I saw the cabanas and they are pretty darn nice. Waitresses are friendly and provide really good service, and love the champagne fire drill!"}
{"text":"With this being my first visit to Liquid Pool Lounge which is located in the beautiful Aria Hotel and Casino. I was attending since for ladies from 11 am to 7 pm they had comp entry. After passing through the pool doors of the Aria I made my way past the two larger pool and to the back where Liquid is located. I arrived there around 12:30 pm and there was about ten people ahead of me. The guests going into Liquid must wear pool type clothes and the dress code is strictly enforced. Once you make it through the security, which is a long encounter. The security here does an extensive look through ladies handbags with a fine took comb and a flashlight. No medication of any kind is permitted, not even Tylenol. If you carry little trial size packages of lipgloss, lipstick, or chap stacks they will be disposed of too. Perfume samples or bottles are not allowed either. This is securities job here and the rules are in place to protect us all.

Once you get through security and get that final duck stamp then the bar is to the left and the DJ to the right. The bar here is more pricey than normal but it is highly touristy here since Liquid Pool is a happening place to be seen at. This would be one of the elite day clubs in Vegas. It is so jumping and the pool is amazing. When I visited it was not too busy yet. One who is here for just general admission has to either stand, go by the pool; but the best advice is to get in the pool after one visits the bar. 
 
The pool was sparkling blue in color with the temperature of the water just perfect. The pool is located so close to the DJ and they were spinning some of the older jams such as Salt n Pepper and Missy Elliot when I got there. They changed the music up around 2 pm when the main DJ got in. He was spinning tracks such as trance and music with lots of bass. The bar keeps your insides going so do the great jams and the water keep one of so cool."}
{"text":"Being a girl in Vegas definitely has its perks, one of them being freebies galore.  We (four girls) were let into Liquid free of charge, had free unlimited champagne until 1 p.m., and we were given a daybed.  I'm surprised we got the daybed because it was Saturday of Labor Day weekend.  However, there weren't a bunch of daybed rentals.  There was great music playing, the water was refreshing, and everyone was super friendly.  Naturally we made friends with guys who also had a daybed and were buying drinks, so that amped up the fun.  I went up to the room earlier than the others, but for one girl, it was her favorite part of the whole trip.  T.I. showed up for a little while too!

Tip:  If you're a girl, don't get the VIP entry/champagne to Liquid as part of your package when you book at Aria.  We changed our reservation so we got entry instead of two buffets.  Entry was free anyway, as was the champagne.  Get the buffets.

One negative: my friend came to the front of the line to get me and she got reprimanded for swearing, which is ridiculous considering everyone had to be 21+ to get in."}
{"text":"Liquid was very clean and modern. Small layout. $50 dollar minimum. $15 drinks. However, the pool boys know what customer service means. On hot days, get the frozen fruits $16, its frozen goodness!"}
{"text":"For an \"Exclusive\" pool, this one sucks. They charge $200 for a lounge chair, and 90% of the staff takes their job WAY too seriously. By that I mean that they are very rude for no reason and they acted like they were working for the CIA, no smiles at all!  

I forgot my license in my hotel room (my fault) and while I stepped aside to look for it  before I realized it wasn't in my bag, the short guy working the entrance said \"You're not getting in here without a license honey!\" \"HONEY!\" I said. I never tried to get in without ID first off, and secondly, I'm not your honey, so don't speak to me like that again! Normally I'm really nice and easy-going, never quick to embarrass others or myself by starting a confrontation, but the way he said that to me felt like he was trying to belittle me and I had to cut that off really quick-like :)

Two of my friends went in and one came back to the other, nicer pool with me while my husband (the guy who has the right to call me honey) ran upstairs to get my license. My friends came back to the nicer pool and explained to me that other than the fact that they have good music, there really isn't a reason to go to liquid.

My husband brought my ID back to me so the girls and I could go listen to some music and try to have a decent time while they went gambling. I figured I'm not going to make a big deal out of the incident earlier, and maybe that guy didn't mean to be rude, so whatevs, we would try out Liquid.  We got in for free, and the drinks were OK. The music was pretty good. A good mix of top 40 and not too much house. The people were really nice, no one was acting drunk or out of control and everyone was getting along and hanging out, so that was really cool. We met a lot of cool people!

THEN, as we were getting out of the pool walking back to our area, some lady  with blonde hair in two braids walks up to my friend (who was just walking back to the other side of the pool) and she purposely bumps into her and says \"I'm a security guard here, MOVE!!!!!!\"  WOW.....    Yes, I did say something and the lady just turned around and stared at me like I was supposed to be intimidated. That was crazy, seeing as how we were all totally sober, we weren't causing any problems and were just walking. I could see if we were acting crazy and the lady just broke up a fight, but no, everything was totally chill and she must have been in a really bad mood. Like I said, you're not a security guard for the president so calm down.

Anyways here are my personal scores,

music  B

Price of the drinks C (everywhere is expensive, so be prepared and don't get mad)

ambiance C- (not as nice as other places I've been but not ugly)

Service D

Customers B (everyone was pretty cool and not stuck-up)

The whole vibe  C 

If you could find somewhere else that is prettier and has better staff and good music, go to the other place (even if it costs a little bit more)!"}
{"text":"Spent a couple of hours @ this place last Sunday. Pleasantly surprised by the place, It was smaller that most other pool lounges but the service was efficient, ambiance very upbeat, great DJ spinning a diverse array of music, super friendly staff, and the good was good. I had a club sandwich, some salad thing, some Bloody Ms...it was great, however, i didn't pay the cover to get in, so not sure of the rates, but there was no shortage of good looking people by 2pm, mingling around, i was definitely & pleasantly surprised at the ratio!"}
{"text":"Dissapointing experience. All the usual BS, not substance. The pool is tiny. Unless you get a $1000 habana, there's absolutely no point of going here."}
{"text":"Reserved 2 chairs through Issac, was quoted 300 and told be there early! Got in line right at 11AM and the two guys in front got 2 chairs on the spot for 225. Now I regret reserving ahead of time.

No champagne fire drill and we stayed till 5. Half of the chairs don't have any coverage in 112 degrees heat. The runners were not as attentive as Bare pool lounge. 

Might be back, but overall, it was somewhat meh."}
{"text":"Was staying at aria for birthday  and heard about liquid so I decided to treat my party of 8. Not very inviting for a day club pool. If your trying to lounge and relax don't bother staff was rude the wannabe pool cop was very rude with my whole party and really changed my mind for me before we entered.. being a dick to guests you want to frequent your business isn't the best promotion strategy.  Maybe get less abrasive tough guys to watch the line or lack thereof of a line. And thank Aria pool and staff they were great and the reason they got 2 stars instead of 1. They were also tipped well."}
{"text":"Pros: 
My friends and I got a day bed for $350 which means you can hang out in the bed and agree to spend at least $350 on food/drinks at Liquid. Bottles start at $550 and individual margaritas start at $14ish. While I had a great time, I could see why others without beds/cabanas wouldn't have enjoyed themselves as much because you could literally only sit around the rim of the pool. 

Drinks: we ordered margaritas and other cocktails. They tasted good and got to us within 20-30 minutes of ordering. The price was to be expected in vegas.

Service: super pretty bikini clad girls that were friendly but forgot our order multiple times. Drinks and food arrived in a reasonable time frame.


Cons:
Music: I can't understand why they played the clean version of every song. It's a 21+ venue, is it not? You're ruining my rap music! 
There was a live dj there... maybe he prefered the clean versions. 
DJ would not play Pretty Ricky.

The pool: it was small but it wasn't overcrowded. You could see the film of sunscreens and bronzer though...

The umbrellas: Once we were burnt to a cinnamon crisp, we wanted our umbrella moved or another one opened to protect our fresh sunburns. The server said there was nothing that they could do. Its too bad that the other umbrellas shading empty beds/benches couldn't be used.

Hours: The website says it's open 11am-6pm. We got there after 1pm and by 4pm staff told us that they were closing. They finally asked everybody to leave at 430pm. Wtf?!

Overall: I had a good time with my girls and I might even come back if our other first picks were full."}
{"text":"This place is run spectacularly and the customer service is top tier. Great crowds, fantastic music, and solid vibes all around. They really pay attention to detail - so much so that they took the time to fold all of our shirts! It was so cute! Obviously it's high priced, but a good value."}
{"text":"Super lame! Boring, poor service, expensive/ rude staff. Headed back to the Comso pool right across the street where it's much nicer instead."}
{"text":"A little small but quality... We did Rehab a few years back and I would come to Liquid again before Rehab."}
{"text":"I arrived at the pool on my birthday yesterday with a group of friends who came from Utah, Cali, and here in Vegas to help me celebrate.  I had on a shirt that said 420 because it happens to be my birthdate.  The guy at the door said that I could not come in because my shirt said 420, had pic of weed on it and that I was too high to come in.  Then he said but happy birthday anyway.  How does he know how high I was  and I don't think that is a requirement to get into a lounge anyway.  We went  to the Mandalay bay and had a good time there but that is the last time we party at Liquid Pool Lounge. Sucks."}
{"text":"I went there on Sunday for a bachlorette party right after we got off the plane. We had a bottle and a cabana and it was the perfect start to our trip! The staff was awesome and we had the best time..Can't wait to go back to Vegas and go back! Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"I WAS having a great day at the Aria hotel, which I do still like. I had a really bad experience at Liquid pool lounge. I got there early and had to wait in line, they insisted on throwing away my Visine eye drops unless I wanted to spend twenty minutes going back to my room to drop them off. (I bribed another employee to hold them for me at a different part of the pool area) Then when I finally got in, they wouldn't let me use my room card to buy a drink so I spent $20 cash on a pina colada. Fine. I asked if I could sit anywhere and was informed that ALL of the seating had high drink minimums. I'm just one 103 pound person. I have to get WASTED AT NOON just to sit ANYWHERE??? It was small; it wasn't even European style and the music was beyond obnoxiously loud. Not going back. Well, I never even got to sit down at all, I had to leave. Feeling unhappy and unrelaxed. Bad policies."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Aria and my friend said she'd gotten a pass to get into the 21 and over Liquid Bar.  It later seemed that we didn't require the pass for our group of 5.  We found a set of couches to perch on.  Hot, Happening, Loud DJ, lots of folks dancing around the pool.  Some in the pool floating on inflatable donuts and throwing these plastic balls all around.  So fun!

No drink service - so we had to go up to the bar, I didn't mind, as long as it's clear.  
A great time.  It was a Sunday around 4pm.  The pool was super warm.  The max. depth was like 3'6\".  
For drink I got a Mojito in a gigantic plastic cup.  My friends got the Watermelon Cooler cocktail.  Bartender's wearing bikini's, they definitely pulled it off.
I met a super cute Aussie guy who was into the coffee lid industry, but I couldn't hear a word he said, so that didn't go anywhere.

At the end of our stay, I was in the pool, lounging on an inflated donut and abruptly was told to leave, get out of the pool.  I took it sort of personal, but they weren't clear ----- it was for everyone.  Just random, we are closing....but then a few moments later, \"All Right, First Person to Jump in!! Go!\"  So, some weird tactic.  We had enough time there.  Just a big huge, Sunday, Re-Hab type pool party.  All ages - like some 20s year old and definitely 50s, so good crowd.  Not all gorgeous intimidating people."}
{"text":"Liquid pool is not what it is cracked up to be. When one goes to a pool club you would expect to at least be able to set your stuff next to you but they try to squeeze out every last penny that they can get for a crappy small pool. Left much to be desired and while some staff members were nice most wouldn't help you unless you had bought a bed. We couldn't even have our stuff right next to us in the pool. They then after we had been there for over an hour informed us that we had to check our draw string bag for $30. On top of this the environment was uneventful and not fun. Staff sub par."}
{"text":"Memorial Day weekend pool party was insane!!! 
The pool area is huge with plenty of cabana space. The dj was on point and played a great mix if you like to dance. 
The bottle service for the cabana area is very on point. They even have built in fridges with Fiji water and an array of other beverages. 
Best day in Vegas was at this pool party!!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous place. We are in a penthouse suite at the Aria and have rented a cabana at the Aria pool. Somebody handed us \"VIP passes\" ( please don't be impressed because I'm not) for \"Liquid\" so we wandered over there. Some ridiculous tiny penis body builder wanna be bouncer demanded we show picture ID.  Memo to management-get rid of the ego-maniac idiot and let 53 year old guys into your god awful place.  I'll just go back to my cabana  and spend ridiculous money on beers!!!"}
{"text":"It is the best kept secret when Vegas gets windy! Got there just before the rush and snagged a bed, with full service: Food, drinks, towels, umbrella, a safe for valuables, a drawer to keep things dry, and all tended to by Jay and the best of all the girls...until we were transferred to a blonde girl who was more concerned about her looks than being paid. Great for meeting people and good music. Service was slow at times but they made sure my allergies were accommodated. 

Every towel dropped was replaced, drinks were poured for us, and didn't have to lift a finger. Just what you need for a day poolside. The pool was a good dance floor when it got warm. 

Closing our tab took far too long, likely because of the one girl. Once our original girl came back we were closed out in no time. I wish I could remember her name because she was absolutely phenomenal and made the whole experience what it was. Worth it!!"}
{"text":"We came here to party and hang by the pool for my bachelorette party and we had the best time! There were 12 of us so we got a reserved lounge area (we did get there early to get a spot close to the pool) and had our own waitress who did an awesome job!

She did a great job keeping the drinks/shots and everything flowing! The watermelon coolers in their logo cups were awesome - so delicious! They were super accommodating to our larger group as well as many others I saw. The DJ did a great job with the music!

The facilities were super nice and we stayed pretty much all day! It had a good crowd, but wasn't overly packed, would love to go back anytime!!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. 7 girls and I came here last weekend, getting onto a guest list and showing up early (free champagne for the ladies from 11-1). We then tried to sit down on one of the day beds, but were kicked off, as it had over a 1,000 food and beverage minimum. Even the lounge chairs were $150 each. \"So where can we actually sit down or put our things?\" \"Ummmm.... in the pool is just about it,\" the bouncer told us. The place wasn't even 1/3 full. 

We went to the bar to put our purses down, and started enjoying the champagne. The DJ was absolutely horrible, and no one was dancing. This seemed like one of the places just to \"be seen,\" loaded with fake boobs, fake tans, dude-bros, and the kind of people we escaped LA to avoid, just there to be noticed. We bounced after 30 minutes and went to Ditch Friday at Palms, where there was a much better time to be had!"}
{"text":"The pool is ok, but really, the things they confiscate from your purse???...gum, tick tacks protein bars, hand sanitizer, deodorant. I asked if they were gonna do a full cavity search as well. Was not impressed with the service, and for that reason, I'd never go back there. You'd think with the thousands they charge for the cabanas they'd be a little more accommodating. They could give you a bag to keep the things they take out of your purse & let you grab them on the way out if they knew anything about customer service."}
{"text":"He didn't let us in in the pool because he said we didn't have a room key. We told him we are going to the liquid pool but he still didn't let us in."}
{"text":"Much like everything in Vegas this is set up to take your money. Free to come in if a guest of the hotel but all seating areas are $750 to start and higher! This goes towards food and drinks but why even throw that out.
Tiny pool.and service just okay.
Stay at the *regular* pool and enjoy the service from the hard working staff!
Shout out to Jocelyn! Great job...keep it up."}
{"text":"The swimming pool version of a VIP area in a club.  Staff is very rude, obviously they shouldn't have to put up with trash like us, 30+ professionals who want to chill out and buy drinks and food all day.  After giving up our first born to get in we looked around for 10 seconds and left.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place, get a cabana at the aria pool.  Way better."}
{"text":"This Adult pool is a lot of fun!   We bought the $100 food and drink minimum for each chair.  By the end of the day we had spent over $300 in alcohol.  We were there last weekend and they had a great DJ on Saturday that kept the party going on all day.  This is an adult pool, but not a topless one.  Many of the adult pools in Vegas are topless pools but this one is not.  Ladies, keep your tops on!  I think it's quite possible that this pool draws a lot of beautiful ladies in because they aren't expected to take their tops off like many of the other adult pools in Vegas.  One major downfall for this pool is that you can't have your drinks in the pool.  However, the water stays alot cleaner since people are spilling their drinks in it.  All in all this pool makes for a great day.  If you're staying at the Aria hotel you ought to try it out."}
{"text":"Less than impressed. Been to a few pool clubs this one the worst! Got there early and within three hours spent over $400. Once the pool was filling up we were ignored because we had no day bed. Even spending the minimum for the day bed we still were treated terrible. Not only did the staff not care but the waitress told me how much I need to put for a tip! Clearly she had no clue how terrible her service was. The only one who cared was a bouncer and the rest of the staff couldn't wait to get us out of there! Go at your own risk of being treated as if you don't matter even when you spend more than the minimum!"}
{"text":"Well it started off great..., but don't expect to leave and get back in easily. As with any other club in Vegas the bouncers take their jobs VERY SERIOUSLY ! my husband and I spent about $350 for our 2 lounge chairs - drinks and food. We were very tame and well behaved I thought. However my husband wanted to take a dip in the pool outside of liquid and upon reentry to liquid stepped over the rope to come back in. Apparently a huge no-no as the bouncers all got worked up because my husband was not bowing down to them and begging to be let in again even though I was inside with a $350 tab going. That was a big dis for both of us. Being kicked out based on a bouncers feelings? We make a ton of money and like to spend it but never again at liquid. We feel we were treated like crap! Because of that we will no longer spend our $$ at any light group clubs, sorry!"}
{"text":"I am just now getting around to writing this review almost a year later but the experience I had at this place still sticks out in my mind.  

Came here with a group of girls on a weekday.  We were told it was a big pool party so we got there at 11 am when it opened and waited in line.   We had to wait about 30 minutes while they let in a couple people at a time.  We were expecting it to be super crowded since they were only letting a few in at at a time.  It was super hot (which is fine since it was Las Vegas in June) but the guy at the door kept giving us the run around about why we couldn't just go in.   

We finally got in and there was absolutely NO ONE in there.   Every bed was completely empty except for two and only a few people were in the lounge chairs and a couple at the bar.    Now we had never been in one of these places so we didn't know we had to pay for a bed.   It was $1000 dollars for the bed which was crazy because there wasn't anyone there.    We did put our stuff down on the bed and were ignored for about 20 minutes until the \"pool director\" came over and informed us of the price.   My friend negotiated with her and since it was so slow we could have the bed but we would have to buy drinks.  My friend put an order in for 3 $25 dollar drinks and a bucket of 6 waters ($50).   We sat for about 40 more minutes and the drinks never arrived however the ladies that came in after us got their stuff immediately.  

We were super pissed so we just left but not without letting the waitress know how angry we were.  She played dumb and pretended like she was \"so sorry\" she forgot.   I don't think they wanted us in there to begin with.  

We went out of Liquid and over to the regular Aria pool where we had a much better time.  It was very relaxed and the pool was nice."}
{"text":"I was there this past Saturday and I could not believe the service provided by the bartenders. With the only exception of Jon, he was the only bartender that didn't seem to give attitude and enjoyed working there. The two other bartenders made me wonder if they were portraying discrimination towards minorities. The blonde chick with the wanna be blue feathers or strips of blue dyed hair had an ugly attitude. I swear if it wasn't because Liquid was the last stop, I would of threw my drink back at her. She had the nerve to give me a drink that was already served and not wanted. Hmm.. How is that ordering the drink I wanted?! Learn to be nicer to everyone, learn how to make drinks and look for another job because obviously you look like you hated it there."}
{"text":"The girl friends and I came out of Haze nightclub and one of the female promoters outside hooked us up for some free champagne at Liquid the next day. She kept us posted by sending out text messages and brought us to VIP status, which enabled us to skip the long lines. Score! We also received free drink vouchers if you \"liked\" their Facebook page. 

The pool itself was small, yet you can still have a great time splashing around with your girls and enjoy the free drinks. Sometimes, I love being a girl. I love you, Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a bottle and cabana for a bachelorette party at Liquid and it was so fun! The service was good and they were very nice to us. It was a Sunday afternoon, so it wasn't too busy, but was still a good time. Next time I wanna go for a party and see how bumping it gets!!"}
{"text":"Where do We start.  Get ready to get discriminated on.  My wife and I will never go back to Aria Hotel nor the Liquid pool lounge in Vegas.  It's more like if they have a white Dj then \"whites\" are welcome and if they have a guess black Dj, then blacks are welcome.  The manager \"buddy jah\" flat out told rudely and racially told us we were not coming in because of the type of swimming trunks I was wearing. Meanwhile I wore the same shorts the day before.   He said get my name and make sure you spell it correctly .  Wow great service.  We ended up leaving our suite rooms and checked in to another near by hotel even tho we hade to pay more money.  It's all about principle.  
Stay away from Aria hotel.  Unless you're cool with cool with experience true racism."}
{"text":"The food poolside is horrible. Two of the servers were amazing but a third one were stuck with was as horrible as the food. Don't waste any money at the pool. Other than that, the amenities were typical. Towel service was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Hysterical good time!  My bestie and I were at the Aria with our Mom's for the weekend and decided to break away for some youthful good times.  This place is ON for people watching and meeting interesting people.  The things we saw and the people we met were movie-worthy.  I swear I wrote this review already but it must not have saved properly. 

Anyway, thank you to the doorman who let us in without a fee.  Yes, after a certain hour aka 3 pm it's $20 for GIRLS to get in.  Okay the place closes at 5 pm.  So for the last two hours they were going to squeeze another $40 out of us rather than enticing us to come in and spend $100+ on booze and water.  The $20 per girl almost lost them the $100+ that I ended up dropping at the bar BEFORE tipping well.  Bad business model if you ask me.  I digress.  We were able to sit at a table with a nice couple who's boys (21 and 25) were in the pool.  Well, I guess the boys had a disagreement of some sort while in the pool and one ended up with a paramedic and a cut.  Que controlled chaos.  Perfect for people watching, so sad for that family, sorry.  Next up is a really nice group of Canadian guys who were very entertaining and genuinely nice.  Had everyone at Liquid been as kind and considerate, it would have not been as fun to sit and watch and chat.  But they were a breath of fresh air. Because all around us were groups of extremely intoxicated girls and guys (many on the older side - not judging just making an observation) eyeing one another up and down and probably peeing in the pool.  It was hysterical!  Reality TV could make a series about day clubs in Vegas and I would watch, without abandon, I would marathon crush those shows. 

Check out Liquid.  We had a great time. The people are nice, staff great.  Maybe don't swim in the pool late in the day but over all it was great and I will go back."}
{"text":"WOW! Talk about a tiny tiny pool filled with a bunch of drunk people. Stopped in on a Saturday, good thing we had some drinks in us because this place was pretty bad. 

- There is no where to sit unless you get bottle service, so bring your credit cards. 
- Overpriced for what you get
- The smallest pool I've ever seen

Honestly, this place was a pain in the butt unless you had bottle service. With so many other options, I would suggest going somewhere else.

However, we did have a blast! The drinks were cold, the music was loud and everyone was just having a great time!"}
{"text":"Went during EDC weekend, and we had a great time. My sister and I got in for free on guestlist through my promoter, and once we got in we noticed no places to sit unless you had a daybed or table.  Since we got in early we were able to talk to a host and secured a table for our party of 4, for a reasonable minimum considering we would have spent the money regardless .  Food and drinks were good. This pool was definitely smaller than I was a expecting, but it gave more of lounge feel than club.  If you're looking for a good time and nothing too crazy then this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. Tiny, dead and they make you throw away all your water and food (goodbye Earl Sandwich :,( ). I've seen community pools at apartments bigger and nicer than this -.- So disappointing..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going to Liquid, just hang out at the ARIA pool.  The bartenders at Liquid were really slow and rude. Also, the pool was really small. I recommend Wet Republic instead."}
{"text":"We were given free passes to Liquid so we thought that we would give it a try.  We liked the set up and concept.  A girl aka Katy Perry, asked for our cell phone number and set us up for the next day as VIP. Interestingly enough, after giving her my cell phone number, I got texts from other Vegas solicitors.  When we arrived, we were greeted by what looked like bouncers and screened.  Seriously, the pool was mostly empty, very few cabanas or lounge chairs were filled....And yet they had to do several checks on everyone before giving us the okay to enter.  Immediately, we were approached with the story about how the system works. You can not sit anywhere unless you pay...$200 for a chair, $1500 for a sofa thing, etc. All personal items must be checked in an amusement park setting locker area and you can use their towels but not sit on them by the pool.  We were in a group of 7. All 3 girls were accused of leaving a pair of red sandals by the steps of the pool.  None of us own a pair of red sandals. Their staff is rude and takes their job overly serious.  We would have gotten the $1,500 package but after being treated like outcasts, we decided to leave and have fun elsewhere.  Very odd experience, they act like its a very exclusive club yet anyone can get in because they pounce on you with free tickets in the casino. They need to go one way or the other.  Either charge everyone a fee to get in so that if you do buy a chair, table, etc., you are guaranteed a certain type of clientel. Or let everyone in and let them sit where ever.  Waste of time and money....stay at the hotel pool, go to the clubs at night!"}
{"text":"I'm more of a day party/pool party person over nightlife so places like this give me life. 

I always stay at Aria so it's only right I visit Liquid.

I've always had a great time and the staff is great.

Rental lockers are right by the pool to store your belongings.

Hop in, flirt and let the DJ go in and you'll have a blast."}
{"text":"WOW! I'm impressed I like this day club a lot! I honestly had never heard of Liquid Pool Lounge until my promoter told me about it. I thought it would be worth a shot since Aria is a nice hotel so most likely they would have a great day club and I was right!

The music here is awesome! They played some hip hop, top 40 and had party beach music! I LOVED IT!

I went here on Saturday for my sister's bachelorette party. We weren't really in the mood to be at a pool party since we had just come from a buffet. We only planned on staying a few minutes but once we were inside I did not want to leave! It was pretty crowded but we found a spot near the speakers to just dance! I would love to come back!

This is just as nice as Encore Beach Club! OH YEAH AND NEVER GO TO WET REPUBLIC! THAT PLACE SUCKS! COME HERE INSTEAD!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I really can't with Las Vegas \"beach clubs\" and \"mega clubs\". It's just not my scene to pay hundreds of dollars to do something I should be able to do for free. Always feels like a ripoff. 

With that in mind, the Liquid beach club at the Aria hotel and casino was a huge disappointment. Like other yelpers have been saying it is a very small pool with very basic lounge and cabana areas. Last year I attended TOA Beach and it had infinitely better pools and lounge areas. My boyfriend and I got in for free because we were guests at the hotel (thank goodness we did not have to pay a cover for that snooze fest). Once arriving the pool had maybe 10 people in it awkwardly sitting on the edge of the pool. 

We found out that all of the lounge chairs cost $215 FREAKIN DOLLARS just to have a place to sit. Are you kidding me? The three pools outside of Liquid are bigger and I can plop my butt down in any of those chairs for free. The whole mentality of treating these beach clubs like night clubs is ludicrous.

I was later talking to a guest who said that lots of people were interested in coming in and joining the \"party\" but once they found out how expensive the chairs were they left. It seems like a loose-loose for the Aria, no pool guests to create the party atmosphere and loss of money on cover charge and drinks. 

If I were to recommend a beach party it would be TOA on a weekend, being on the guest list, with a party full of women. Then you may have a good time at these \"exclusive\" clubs."}
{"text":"Unfortunetely I can NOT recommend the place to anyone. Stuff is really unprofessional. The guy at the entrance is very rude. I would say the management should be more careful hiring stuff. The place is super small."}
{"text":"I cannot talk about the crowd or ambiance because we could not stand it for more than 1 min. However I can say that the employees behave like they own the place, probably there is no manager.  No one pays to enter. Worst thing in Aria"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff are really nice. The place is spacious and comfy with plenty of cushioned benches, chairs and pads to lay on. Hot cocktail waitresses, nice bartenders, and a live DJ as well. The pool isn't too steep at all, so there really isn't much swimming involved, just lounging. They serve food here as well, and I tried a couple of items. The salad was alright, and the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. It was tender with just the right mesh of ingredients. My friends told me that the burger was delicious! Overall, a great spot to hang out if you're at Aria."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!

First to get in I was practically strip searched.  They took my case of vitamins and showed at least three different security guards before they decided they were ok.  BUT I couldn't use any of them while in the pool area.  I had to make sure I didn't take them out.  F'ing dumb.  They're vitamins.  They then confiscated my tangerines.  I had three of them.  I always make sure I stash a few snacks on me in case my blood sugar gets low but they felt it was a security issue to have three tangerines.  It's seriously easier to enter the pentagon or White House than Liquid.  Oh, did I mention we spent over $1200 for the day?!?  Seriously?  I'm going to spend $1200 but I can't keep a couple of tangerines?!?!  The pool was small, the food was gross, the atmosphere was stupid, the DJ sucked.  The only thing I could compliment was the staff once we entered.  They always made sure to refill our drinks (with the $600 bottle of Kettle One we purchased).  This place is a joke - save your time and money.  F Liquid!"}
{"text":"Liquid is Aria's answer to Wet Republic, Bare, Moorea Beach Club, Encore Beach Club, and just about every other day time pool party that the strip has to offer. It's managed by the Light Group, which also manages Bare. With that in mind, its like being at a nightclub in the day time with DJ's spinning music, alcohol being overpriced, and girls in skimpy attire. 

What does it have going for it? It's in Aria, which is a nice property. The facilities are top notch, but I still think that Encore Beach Club is a better bet for your daytime partying needs."}
{"text":"The pool was clean and really nice, kind of
Small in comparison to the other day clubs. But i enjoyed myself. It was my bday and we had a great time....
Slightly high on the prices but that's to be expected when visiting the day clubs. Service was GREAT. My table waitress was so friendly attentive and incredibly beautiful. 
We live here, and will def be back"}
{"text":"I can't compare this to any other exclusive pool scene as this has been the only one my wife and I have been to. We had just planned on going to the regular pools at Aria when we spied this place and became curious. There was a podium we passed that had guys handing out VIP passes to young ladies walking by. When my wife and I stopped, they did their best to ignore us...it was actually quite comical....let's ignore the paying guests! LOL That's a strange business model. Finally one of the gents asked my wife if he could help her....she asked about the club and fees. He said she could definitely get in for free but that I would normally need to pay. But then he said it was fairly slow, so he gave me a pass as well. We didn't have our ID's so I ran back to the room to get ours. The club staff were actually fairly pleasant and helpful. We shared one lounge chair given the $100 minimum. It was after 3pm so we weren't going to splurge for two lounges. After 4pm, one of the staff came over and said we could take another adjacent lounge for free. The majority of the customers were 20-30 year olds and we're quite friendly and very amusing to watch. My wife and I likened the final bill to being the same as a show bill......except the customers were the show! We had two pitchers of margaritas and two bottled waters. The grand total was somewhere around $170.00 with the tip. The venue was cigar friendly, so I was quite content in sitting back, smoking my stogies, sipping on a margarita and watching the madness unfold. Actually, a couple of people came by and remarked how good my cigars smelled and wanted to know where I had gotten them. The staff seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd. One of the waitresses was thrown in the pool by a few of her coworkers. The music was bass pounding hip-hop....not exactly our thing but it was a great soundtrack for the spectacle. Overall we had a good time. The staff was very attentive....coming by to refill your glass, empty your ash tray and make sure you didn't need anything else. The club closes at 6pm and when we left we could very clearly see the lack of any vibe at the basic pools. They were nice...but very laid back. So, it's all in what you are looking for. The people watching value in Liquid was pretty priceless!"}
{"text":"We just missed Jamie Foxx! Booooo =(

My friend's friend works for Liquid and told us about the free champagne until 3p. Beam me up Scotty! We had just 2 1/2 glasses each. The bartender was uber chill and had PERFECT teeth. There weren't very many people there since it was still early, but the crowd was very pretty to look at. Seriously, eye candy for all the boys and girls.

Liquid is pretty chill actually. They had OK music playing, didn't see a DJ but the music was pretty loud thanks to the speakers strategically placed everywhere. If you don't plan on sitting anywhere then you are all set. Majority of the seating areas are reserved, so we just sat at the bar.

Overall, it's a nice and chill. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I came during the week so it was pretty laid-back.  Got a pool-side daybed for a $375 spend minimum.  It's a small pool, but it was very clean and service was very good.  I actually enjoyed the food and drinks here better than Encore Beach Club.  The Mahi Mahi tacos, beer battered onion rings, and coconut shrimp were amazing.  They have great prices on bottles of champagne-$385 for 2 bottles of Moet Ice where Encore was $495 for one.  It's a good pool for when you need a chill day."}
{"text":"So we're in Vegas right now and it's raining. We go to liquid because we are staying in the aria and encore closed. It's slightly raining and we decided to go to liquid. There is literally no one there, not a single person in line. We walk up and the guy tells us we have to wait. Wait for what?! For him to finish his text message!!!! There are 5 of them standing there doing nothing and we have six people who were willing to spends a few k to get drunk....in the rain. Seriously?! We turned around and went to the aria bar. Amazing bar tender, warm hot tub. Still dumbfounded...."}
{"text":"My girls and I came here and had a fun time, but nothing worth writing home about.  We got in without cover and got a free daybed, so we ended up ordering food to splurge a little. As good as the menu items sounded,  the turkey burger and fish tacos tasted bland.  The drinks were fine, the crowd was okay and the music was decent.  Our time there was fun but it's not worth any cover or any food/drink minimum. I say come visit if you happen to stay at the City Center. Worth the walk to peek in and look, but no need to take a taxi over here...not worth the $12."}
{"text":"So my party and I went to Liquid on the first Tuesday they were open this season. First off the security at the Aria didn't even know the day club was open. The staff at Liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guests excluding my party at the club. They have plenty of lounge areas amd cabanas for a busy day, but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area around a unexpectedly small pool didn't exactly seem worth wild. Maybe on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool day club, but it just wasn't for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I won't go into detail, but let's just say I talked my way into a packed Boys Noize pool party for 4 friends & I without ever being on a guest list!

 I highly recommend getting on a list because you can't pull this stuff everyday & the girls behind us got turned away.  

Not only did we get in despite arriving pretty late in the afternoon, but we got in for free & got to see an amazing DJ do his thing!

Drinks here are expensive  BUT luckily we made friends with the boys w/ bottle service so the good times kept on rolling.

This pool is not too big, so unless you get here super early or reserve cabanas, you probably will not have a place to sit. However, there is plenty of fun party people in the pool tossing beach balls and enjoying each other's company. 

You can check your things in upon arrival (complimentary) so you don't have to worry about leaving your purse or wallet unattended & can go have a blast.

I would recommend this party for the younger crowd 20-30's. It is loud & fun & not for people looking to lay back and relax! 

Good place to go if you want to be social and dance!"}
{"text":"LV Yelpers! 
Lookin' for a pool party?! Liquid @ Aria... is a must do if you're in the area.

I came here this past weekend, both Saturday and Sunday (I stayed at Vdara, so it was easy for me to just walk over without catching a taxi).

Saturday was great came around 1pm stayed till 6... weather was nice, packed with people and good music. That day, they charged $40 for guys and free for girls... with a $200 minimum per chair... which we wanted 2 chairs... but they could only offer us 1. On a good note, music was great! I danced for 5 hours straight and entertained all of liquid. Left with a lot of fans, lol. On an off note but not surprising, a couple was caught having sex in the pool and got kicked out.

Sunday came around 1230pm left at 330pm... weather wasn't great... windy... clouds over sun... there was a little sunshine here and there... but due to the weather, it wasn't as crowded as Saturday. People actually remembered me from the day before... guess I stood out with all that dancin I was doin. That day, they didn't charge cover for guys... but they wanted a $50 minimum per chair and there was 4 of us, so we spent another $200. It was so windy that day that one the lounge beds flew up in the air and almost landed on me! =( 

Yummm! I don't drink alcohol, so I was all about the food! Good stuff!
I had alot of food on their menu:
- ahi
- shrimp cocktail
- club sandwich
- coconut shrimp
- virgin pina colada
- virgin mango daiquiri 

- they even got us coffee, which wasn't on the menu.

$25 for liquid shirts. I love mines!

Bathroom is clean.

Except to wait 20-30 mins. for your bill.

Come here if you don't have a problem dropping $200 (food/drinks) for fun in the sun. Not super packed, so there's room to breath and dance!

-1 star for $200 for 1 chair... and not being able to accommodate us with 2 chairs. Paying that much $, they should make it happen!

I hope to return one day! Worth checkin out. Mixed crowd.
Don't forget your ID!
Enjoy my photos =0)

Lots of X&O to LIQUID! I miss U!"}
{"text":"I got kicked out of the pool for smoking out of a vape pen, walked back to my hotel, threw on some new gear, and got right back in. #suckers.

The pool is kind of small compared to the other LV pool parties which is why I give it three stars tho."}
{"text":"Ohh emm gee ! I had amazing time here with my girlfriends. We went in a Thursday and has a blast. Great food, people and drinks. The music was amazing and we literally danced the whole time. The previous reviews do it no justice. This was one of my fav pool parties while we were in Vegas ! 

Food wise order the quesadilla it was super good and the chips and dip."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the way the staff treated me. I was a guest in the hotel and asked a staff member, Nicholas Fontana, for advice on places to go that night. He text me asking if I \"take my panties off\". Sexual harassment should be expected if u go here. Don't waist ur time at Liquid unless u want to be treated like a fucking prostitute. Go to the encore instead"}
