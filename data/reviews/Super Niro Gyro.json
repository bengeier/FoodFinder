{"text":"Very nice looking place. Frozen burger patties with no flavor. Fresh fries and just ok. Should have tried chicken or something more fresh."}
{"text":"They have good food but there FALSE ADVERTISEMENT for meals on their billboard outside is ATROCIOUS! I had a long Tuesday, all I wanted was Gyro Meal. On there billboard outside it said \"6.99 Single Gyro Meal.\" I thought KOOL but no, they tried to charge me almost $9.00. When I questioned them on the matter, he said it was a MONDAY Deal....Seriously! Not far AT ALL NIRO GYRO! Very poor customer sercice. Good Luck getting my business back. Right is Right!"}
{"text":"The place is always on point. We always order online and it's always ready for us when we get there. The eating area looks really cool and the food is great, especially for the price. I'd come here again and again!"}
{"text":"Usually fantastic but problems today. First we were charged 10.99 for the Double Gyro meal even though the menu on the wall behind the counter shows $10 for this meal. Our waitress said she had to go with what rang up.

Secondly our Philly Steak Sandwich was about half the size as usual because had been put on the wrong bun (or they've decided to downsize this sandwich). Not happy with this change if they've decided to do this intentionally."}
{"text":"My reason for this 1 star rating is simple. They either use boxed meat or precook.all the gyro meat in the morning. They have it sitting in a tub and portion it out as orders are placed. GROSS. The rotisseries arent on givingnthe meat that wonderful charred taste. They just throw some on the flat top, squirt a little water on it and put a lid over it to steam heat it. 
Its flavorless, juiceless and rubber. Horrible.
I hate going on campus but will do so when in the mood for a gyro from now on."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, & large portion makes a good place to eat whether you live near or are passing through."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week. Now I've been twice since! One of my new favorite restaurants in Champaign. Recommend getting the chicken kabobs and a greek salad - so good! And that staff is so nice. Seems like a tight knit group of employees that make outstanding food. They have an app and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Yeah, Meh defines it. Nice establishment, the cashier/manager was very nice. 
However the gyro was mediocre at best. Cucumber sauce was bland, I was better of buying it at the store. Meat needed a little more seasoning. Gyro was disappointing"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place. We ordered Chicken Kabob sandwich. It was delicious, but I think compared to the quantity I find it a bit pricy."}
{"text":"My favorite place for gyros. Not only is their food amazzzzzing, but it's a clean place and has friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was quick and very professional.  I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about Niro's is the service. I have always had a positive experience there. The owner is wonderful and has been working in the kitchen there almost every time I go. They do call-ahead ordering, which is awesome when you only have a 30 minute lunch from work. I haven't tried many of their menu items because I love their burgers so much. That is usually what I get. As far as sides, their fries, chili cheese fries, and mozzarella sticks are all really good. The seating area is usually clean and pretty quiet. Their bathrooms are also well-maintained. Of all the Niro's in town, this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Thinks McDonald's for Mediterranean Food but slower and better.

I've visited this place twice with my family. Both times, we ordered a beef kebob plate, falafel, grape leaves, and double gyro plate. 

Beef kebob was mediocre, the meat was grilled well but lacked flavor. It comes on a bed of rice (that is also a bit bland).

The falafels are good. Not the best I've had, but much better than my expectations. Pretty flavorful and moist. 

Grape leaves were very good - favorite part of my meal.

Double gyro plate is such a good deal!! comes with twice the amount of meat, a pita, a drink, and a side of fries. the gyro was pretty good, and the pita was nice and warm. 

Overall the food is pretty good, and fairly cheap. falafels and grape leaves cost twice as much on the east coast. The thing that throws me off and prevents me from giving a better review is the setting. The restaurant is weird shaped (maybe used to be Sonic drive through??) and too big, making the experience impersonal. Also, the set up is supposed to be fast food like, but the service is actually a little slow."}
{"text":"Awful delivery times. While the food is ultimately good, ordering take out from there took over 2 hours. Find somewhere else."}
{"text":"We've been there twice now. I wish it were located in town so we could go more often. The shop is the old Dog 'n Suds and is not much remodeled. It is clean and spacious. The eating area could be a little better lit, but overall is good. Tables are not crowded together, and there are a variety of table sizes to choose from so it can as easily accommodate a lone diner as it can a large group.  And there were some of each when we went. The counter where one orders is large and bright, and the menu is overhead and easy to read, although a few items could use more detailed descriptions (does the hummus come with pita, for example, or do I need to order a side of pita?). The servers were helpful and cheerful. After ordering they brought the food to our table.

   The menu is essentially the menu they offer in-town but with several very nice additions, like falafel, hummus, fatoush salad, and tabouleh salad, among others. On the first trip I had the falafel sandwich and my wife had the gyro. The gyro is ample, with lots of gyro meat, tomatoes, onions, and sauce. It is delicious and, with a side order of an extra pita, is itself enough for two. With a drink and fries it is plenty of food for even a very hungry person.  The falafel too was good. The fried chickpea balls were done perfectly. My sandwich had seven of them, along with lettuce, onions; a tahini sauce came with it and was excellent.  My only complaint is that the pita was not up to par. It was a bit dry and broke apart easily. Clearly different from the thick, deliciuos pita used in the gyro. (I don't think the gyro is technically a pita, as it does not appear to have a pocket.)  All in all though, it is a fine falafel sandwich, and I can think of only one other place that serves them in town.

   On the next visit we ordered the fatoush salad, tabouleh salad, and our daughter had an Italian Beef.  The salads were great. Fresh and delicious.  The tabouleh is \"greener\" than many, meaning it had a lot more mint and parsley than others I've had in town, but it was excellent.  It comes in a small, clear cottage cheese carton. When I saw it I wondered if it would be enough.  But, being that tabouleh has so much bulgur grain, I found it ample. No need for fries with a pint of grain and veggies.  The Italian Beef was large and hot and satisfying. It is thin sliced beef with au jus on the side or poured over the sandwich.  I recommend you ask for it on the side for neatness if nothing else.  Unlike most, the beef is not spiced, but it is delectable. The peppers are optional, which I think is rather odd for an Italian Beef, as I think the peppers are what distinguish it from a French Dip. But no matter, the taste was great. The french loaf was fresh, soft, and tasty. The au jus not salty. and the sandwich filled to the brim with beef.

    All in all this is one of the best fast food options around. I wish their other locations offered the expanded menu. But I think it will be a regular stop when we are in the North Prospect area of town. I put it in the category of not worth a trip just to go there, but well worth the stop if you are in that part of town."}
{"text":"I used to work at a Mediterranean restaurant owned by Greek man and his Syrian wife, who was the cook. Her food was phenomenal. I used to go to Niro's before I worked there, and afterwards I can't help but make a comparison. 
Their (Niro's) tabbouleh salad was very, very good. Actually, I can honestly say I liked it better than my old boss. 
The humus was good, as well, but isn't quite as good as my boss's. 
The falafal wasn't what I expected, and while it wasn't bad, it just isn't to my taste.
The gyro was delicious, but the only problem is that they didn't put any sauce on it. I ordered online and added feta, so I wonder if maybe they thought I'd rather have feta cheese in place of the sauce, instead in addition to. But, I made do, and added the humus and tabbouleh to the sandwich, and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"While Niro's is normally a great choice for me, this location has let me down twice now.  The first time they let me down, I paid for and was missing an order of fries, and my gyro had onions, which I had requested no onion.  Last night, another let down.  First off, I ordered online, was given a 20 minute wait time and when I arrived close to 20 minutes later, my order was not even started.  So after waiting for my order, they had it wrong.  They left out cheese sauce, which was paid for, and an order of fries...again.  I will not be visiting this location again, I'll return to my beloved University Avenue store."}
{"text":"Service: I have NEVER had bad service at this place. Everyone has always been friendly, and willing to help!

Cleanliness: VERY clean place! The staff really seem to take time to care for this place!

Food: The food is delicious! I enjoy the falafel sandwhich. 4 stars, because the food is sometimes luke warm. 

Overall, highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I ordered $30 plus worth of food the driver knew I was paying cash they charge $4.00 for delivery ... first he went to wrong place even though he had address and called me... I had $40 bill was $31.00 he got it all cause he had no change and wanted to run back to his car I don't have time to wait for you to go back and forth ... so I get up stairs there is no Tiki sauce for my Gyro WTF and no Baklava!!!!  I call them they ask me if I want the credit to stop by a different time I'm like I just spent $30 plus dollars on food from you that you forgot plus I can't eat my gyro without Tiki sauce really so they ran it over mind you I'm on third floor so I have to go down and back each time ... these guys need to get their shit straight .... I'd like a full refund on my order ... the food that I did eat tasted good unfortunately I couldn't enjoy the food due to the fact it was a two hour turn after their f up"}
{"text":"ill come back just because the service was that good! they're very friendly nice people! i got the weekend combo which was 2 gyros, fries and a drink for $9...the gyros are so freaking huge! its too much for 1 person to finish...the fries are delicious...they give u a lot of meat and im not much of a lamb fan but even then i found it very savory. they charge more for chicken though...its pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. We had chicken kabob dinner with rice and salad. Enough to share for 2, unless you're real hungry - then have at it.  My son ordered the gyro and was happily satisfied.  The place is spacious and very clean.  Will definitely come back on our next campus visit."}
{"text":"Never had a problem at the Niro Gyro store on Springfield Ave. in Champaign. Ate their dozens of times. I realize that the owner of this store was once the owner of the store on Springfield Avenue. Quite a difference between that store then and this one now.
A buddy of mine texted me that he was in town visiting his sister at Carle Hospital. He wanted to grab a bite & didn't want to drive all the way to the Springfield Avenue store. So we tried this location. 
The lady that took my order was friendly (one star). Food was hot & fresh (one star), but took 14 minutes for a grilled chicken combo & a bowl of chili (zero stars). Value of food for my dollar (one star)
Store was clean but the sit down area furthest from the front door and the cold was blocked off. I rather not sit near the door when it is -14 below outside (minus one star). Especially when the thermostat near the empty Ketchup dispenser read 56 degrees (see my picture). Brrrrrr."}
{"text":"Large, cold and empty restaurant right in front of Menards. Looks like a intergalactic drive thru straight out of the Jetsons. I ordered the Monday special which was a single gyro meal.   The food came out fairly fast.  The ketchup machine sprayed ketchup all over me.   One of the male employees got me a wet towel to wipe off the ketchup from my sweatshirt, pants and shoes... No compensation (which would've been nice) but just a cold \"sorry about that\" from the cashier.   By the time I cleaned up, my food was almost cold.  The gyro was dry and poorly assembled.... The fries were bland and tasted like Something from the freezer section.  Give me Zorba's any day."}
{"text":"Was in town and need to grab dinner for the family to bring back to the hotel.  Spent $46 for 6 people with food left over, includes drinks.  The food was pretty decent.  The service was excellent.  The guy at the register was extremely friendly and helpful with our menu questions.  Menu was extensive, good amount of choices.  I like that they have Mediterranean, Greek, and your standard hotdog/ burger menu.  Prices were very reasonable for what we got.  I would definitely return if back in town.  The interior is clean, newer and nicer than exterior."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure is Super Niro Gyro. I've had their gyro, Chicago style hot dog and the falafel. I must say it is super delicious and I'll definitely be back for more. The tzatziki sauce is so creamy and flavorful on the gyros and the lamb meat is moist and succulent with a slight crispiness. The Chicago Style hot dog is right on point- and though I'm not a fan of sport peppers, I always eat them. Now the falafel. I've never had falafel before so I didn't really know they were fried, I don't eat many fried foods but this was so tasty and moist- I loved it. If you're in the area definitely give them a go. When I don't want to make food at home, this is my go to place."}
{"text":"This place is a find!  We are here for business and decided to give it a try. The food is delicious and the portions are generous. Have been back twice now. Tried the greek salad with gyro meat and the single gyro. All made to order. The service is also exceptional and the restaurant is very clean. The phone is constantly ringing with pick-up orders so I'm glad the locals are keeping them busy. You can also drive through. This is a must try and you won't be disappointed!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Traveling thru area and searched up this gem. DH had the traditional gyro, and I had a grilled chicken version. Both were very, very good! The chicken was especially well-seasoned. Son was not so happy with the cheddar beef sandwich. Very hot, and too much cheese sauce rendered it inedible. Skin-on fries were really good -- crisp and meaty, with minimal oil. Will definitely come, again!"}
{"text":"Pure horsesh**. Any decent greasy spoon joint can serve a good cheeseburger - except Niro's. I was served a tiny, tasteless, cheap patty on an oversized stale bun. I had better burgers in my grade school cafeteria. Poor quality. Zero value."}
{"text":"Great find while traveling. I've spent many years overseas and this place brings back many fond memories. We ordered our food online through YELP going down the road and picked it up on the way to the hotel. We chose the Gyros for two with extra sauce, falafel balls with tahini,tabouli salad and baklava for desert. It was way to much food! The Gyros are great and with fries would have been enough. The falafel balls are also good but we didn't like the tahini sauce and used the extra Gyro sauce instead for dipping. Don't be surprised though, it's Gyro sauce not Tzatziki. More like a sour cream. The tabuli salad was disappointing, I don't recommend it. The baklava was great! Only order one piece though,it's so sweet and decadent it's enough for two. The staff is great and very pleasant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great people and great food. Long live Niro on Town Centre!  The service is excellent, the portions are amazing.  You won't overpay for your food here, but you'll leave wishing you had more room #eyesbiggerthanstomach"}
{"text":"They actually have pretty decent quality meat and most of the time they have good service with a drive-thru option. Their gyros are soft and juicy with a bit of grease, so they will not be crispy like you might expect from more traditional Mediterranean style gyros. But they are very good for what they are and you can mix and match with add-ons (peppers, sauce, etc). 

One time I did not receive my fries in my order, so I drove back when I realized it upon getting home. The employee at the drive thru didn't believe me and insisted she gave them to me. The manager ended up handing out fries after I showed him the receipt but I felt a bit slighted by that whole experience. Seemed to be an anomaly though, since the service is usually great like I said."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service! Usually order Greek/Mediterranean items. Frequently take home the delicious hummus. Can't speak for the burgers but past experience at other similar establishments says don't risk it. Dogs and beef sandwiches not bad. Generous portions! Very clean! For those who don't understand the \"Jetsons\" appearance, this place was originally a Dog and Suds drive in  that was never run responsibly. It was always dirty and slow! Suffered a sad and early demise. Glad you took over Niros!"}
{"text":"Of all of the Niro's around town, this one is my favorite. By far the friendliest, and most helpful staff. They go out of their way to provide great service, and always warmly greet you!

The food is fantastic as well. Their gyros are on point, and the tzatziki sauce is creamier than most places, yet pretty delicious and refreshing. By far my most two favorite items on their menu are the hummus and chicken philly. I didn't expect the hummus to taste so good, or look so fantastic, but wow. The chicken philly also is awesome, the chicken is marinated well, and they include all the toppings of a standard philly. Also, the amount of fries they give you is burdensome, yet extremely welcome. They're very lightly if at all salted, and always fresh. 

Portions are large, double gyro normally takes me 2 sittings to eat."}
{"text":"Food is subpar, tastes fine if you want something basic. Last time I ordered my food came nearly 2 hours after placing the order."}
{"text":"If you're looking for typical Chicago fast food, such as a hotdog or Italian beef or a gyro sandwich, this is a place to get a fast and decent meal. It isn't of stand out quality however and so it just turns average marks from me."}
{"text":"Some friends and I visited this location near the mall last week for lunch.  I have lived in Champaign area for about 16 years, but have never really frequented any of the Niro's locations.  I think I've only been to the one on Springfield once.

Italian Beef :  This was a monster sized sandwich for the price (5.99).  I ended up getting the hot peppers (which is a giardiniera mix of carrots and pickled peppers) and cheese for .50 extra each.  Making it a meal (fries + drink) is 2.19 extra, so my bill was around $10.   Overall I was pretty satisfied, but the fries are just average.  I'd be more apt to get the meal if the fries were unique in any way.  I will probably try the sweet peppers next time as the hot was not very hot.

My dining companions come here pretty often, and they got an assortment of other items.  Single gyro, BBQ gyro, Pizza Puff.   Again, large portions of gyro meat with each order.  Another friend eats low-carb diet, and he was able to order 1/2 pound of the meat separately.  It's nice that they are willing to accomodate some dietary restrictions.  They have an unexpectedly diverse menu (italian beef, italian sausage, gyros, burgers, chicken sandwiches).  They even have hummus, kabobs, and other side items.

Overall, I thought it was decent value and I'd probably go back if my lunch group decides to go.  I'm not sure the meal upgrade is worth it, but it wasn't a bank breaker."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken kabobs. The quantity is good. I love getting the Chicken dinner meal and its big enough for me to eat for 2 days. The people working there are nice. It is also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"You know what happens when you let a Marine run your restaurant? I don't know if he actually manages the place but he's definitely the reason I'm coming back. This guy gives the best service I've seen in a restaurant in quite a while and I literally eat every meal at restaurants because I travel a lot for work. 

Not only is the service great, I got this meat combo which was like 3 different types of meat on skewers, a salad, a large soda, fries, some falafel, and ice cream-still under $20! The food was just right. 

I love this place already and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped for the night in Champaign while on the road and was looking for a place to get good and inexpensive food after 9pm. Glad to have found Super Niro! Yummy gyros and fries. The folks working there were really friendly. Our order was ready fast and I'll for sure come back next time I'm coming through."}
{"text":"Hummus served with warm pita was good.  Fries tasty.  Gyros though was bland and seemed like it was precooked and not heated to order.  African American man who served me at the drive thru was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on our way to Red Robin when we spotted this place, a quick u-turn and wow. My wife got the double gyro dinner and I got the Italian beef.
First the portions are LARGE, second the food was awesome. My wife is a bit of a food snob especially gyros and beefs, growing up next door to a family of Greeks who owned and operated a Greek restaurant, and having a Portillo's a mile from her house. She Loved both the gyro and the beef, even the fries were special. Please don't forget to get the baclava it is GREAT! 
Outstanding staff, clean place, great food!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you need a quick bite. 
The place is usually empty whenever I go and they make your food to order.
Tried a few things on their menu:
Hummus is yum!
Burgers and fish sandwiches are a bit plain.
Gyros are always super dry! Took a lot of water to get it down.
Kebab plates aren't bad and decently priced but you're also going to need a large drink with it to finish the plate."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Large menu and fast drive thru. You can also eat inside in large clean interior or get delivery. The portions are large and high quality. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"As I live nearby to this place, I have passed right by it many times. But still, never thought of trying it out. Last week, I saw someone posting a review for this place and it caught my attention. It had some good reviews, so I decided to finally try it out. I went here yesterday and ordered falafel sandwich and onion rings to go. While waiting, I checked out the seating area. It was beautiful, very clean, well lit from natural light and had ample seating. My falafel sandwich came with tahini sauce on the side. It had falafel inside pita bread along with sliced tomatoes and lettuce. Tasted really good. Just wished, they had put some salad with dressing inside sandwich to keep it moist. Onion rings were crispy and nice. Really liked my meal. Next time, gonna try chicken kabob."}
{"text":"Great customer service! 
Excellent food and service. They initially forgot our order of extra pita bread and when we called them they delivered the bread to our home with a few extras including dessert. Great people and we will definitely be loyal customers."}
{"text":"Update review:
Although my first experience was amazing, this subsequent visit was very lukewarm. The happy go lucky guy at the counter must have been having a bad day due to mixing up someones order. He just appeared depressed and not very talkative. Without him at the counter expediting things and greeting people, this place just seemed very cold. The cashier who was the same cashier as last time somehow did not give me a cup for my combo meal which I had to ask for as I waited 14 minutes for my 1/2 lb burger to cook. Stick with the gyro and Mediterranean food. The burger was terrible, it had no meat flavor or flame taste. It tasted like it had been sitting in a vat of hot water. Fries were super small with the combo meal. My wife's order also was mixed up. She ordered a single gyro sandwich meal and was charged for a italian combo. She had to go back afterwards because she thought it was the same price after they fixed her order, but it is 70 cents different to get her money back. No apology, nothing. She also had to wait 14 minutes to get her meal. I can honestly say if you come for the weekend deal the double gyro platter that will be enough for 2 people, but without that deal this place is really not that good."}
{"text":"Four of us enjoyed lunch. We each had a Gyro sandwich and fries. The meat was delicious and the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. We'll make this a regular place lunch and dinner. We learned the new owners began operating the restaurant in May, 2016. They're doing a great job."}
{"text":"I went there around 8pm. I stood in line with my friend and a stranger awkwardly for several minutes without anyone serving us. I tried calling for attention two to three times and waving. The workers were intently watching soccer with their backs to us in the kitchen. I know this chain and I've never had a problem like this in its Urbana counterparts, so I'm hoping it's just due to avid sports fandom. I only had fries. My friend's food looked dry and overcooked."}
