{"text":"This fairly recent addition to the Little Italy dining scene has an interesting menu, with good representation of fish and seafood and a very good wine list (mostly privately imported). I have been twice, mostly recently last evening. On the second occasion, I had a seafood chowder followed by a main of scallops, sweetbreads, etc. Both dishes were excellent.  Julien the barman is attentive and really knows his wines (I sat at the bar for both dinners and enjoyed our chats). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. There was not a huge choice on the menu (not a lot of pasta either) but there was enough to find something good to eat. I had the beef steak which came with heated romaine lettuce, a little bit of very strong blue cheese and three odd-looking but tasty potatoes. The sauce was tasty. It was a good dish. Before the main course we were brought potato bread which was tasty although a little dried on the edges (like it had been pre-cut earlier). The desserts looked equally eclectic but we were both too full to order one.

Overall it was a nice relaxed restaurant with nice decor and a fantastic 80s ballards playlist. I would come again but I wouldn't come regularly because the menu didn't offer enough choice."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last weekend and the place is lovely. Very delicate food (and it was brunch!) made by professional cooks. Service was impeccable. The decor is really nice too. The brunch prices were really reasonable, I believe it's kind of pricey for dinner though."}
{"text":"I went to Salmigondis for brunch today and it was very tasty. I loved the design of the place, very cozy and stylish vibe with what seemed to be a beautiful terrace tucked in the back, waiting for spring to pop through the snow. The drinks were fantastic, with a special twist to them and a bartender (mixologist?) who mixes yummy drinks with confidence. I had the fish cakes- they had great flavour but lacked a bit in the crispy department. My dining partner had the gravlax which was good. Both were presented on fancy plates with colourful garnishes which is always a star in my books. I love the layout of the menu- not too big, yet very complete. These people know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Delish!  I'm no foodie, but I know when food tastes good, and this restaurant serves up refreshingly unique dishes.

For lunch, we tried the cauliflower lemongrass coconut (cold) soup, and I was so inspired by the delicate flavours that I want to try this soup combination at home ASAP.

I had the chicken burger for the main, and it was a great gourmet burger that still had the guilty pleasure tastes of a burger burger. Came with the best fresh cut French fries I've tried in Quebec. (I'm from Ontario where the abounding chip trucks are no city pilot project :p) (Did I just lose review credibility with the Ontario reference?)

Finally, dessert. Mium. Beignes maison, flan, Kem CoBa ice cream, beautiful berries, brunt meringue, some other Italian goodness etc. (see photo).

They're serious about their coffee too (thank you!  Gawd, how nice it is to drink a good cappuccino with your dessert).

I will be returning to check out their brunch!  Heard talk of eggs Benedict. Yummy yum yum miam!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant... hidden gem in Little Italy, Montreal. Amazing zucchini flowers and the ricotta doughnut! A must try... will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the pickled herring, trout tartare, and jerusalem artichokes for starters. All delicious, especially the jerusalem artichokes. Really unique and rich vegetarian dish- will be recommending to all my vegetarian friends. 

For mains we tried the mackerel and the gnocchi. The mackerel was pretty awful. Weird cajun spice, poor quality fish, and forgettable sides. Bad overall. 

The gnocchi was to die for. Unique shape and texture- more like european stype dumplings. Extremely rich sauce. So delicious

Wines by the glass were not great but cocktails were pretty good."}
{"text":"The food here NEVER fails to impress here - from the quality of the ingredients, to the combination of every component of the dishes. That being said, everything on the menu is a must try. The chef, Bryan, is so talented and makes almost everything in house. Every course of the meal is executed to perfection by the amazing staff. Humble, lively and comforting, Salmigondis is hands down THE best restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this nabe bistro and was handsomely rewarded.  Food is prepared with passion and inspiration.  Wine list is curated with thought.  Meal was so good, we returned on Saturday for brunch and had an even better time.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 girls. We were late for our reservations but they were very accommodating. The food was excellent, customer service was superb! Would come back here over and over again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant and our meal was an outstanding way of beginning a bright Saturday morning. 
Greeted very nicely and politely by the staff, The restaurant is surrounded by a lovely and simple decor, with the right amount of classiness and elegance. The space is not big, yet it's spacious and comfortable enough to move around. One of my favourite touches, was the open kitchen. You see absolutely everything, this is where our meals were made...
We began with the perfect cup of hot chocolate, homemade and not from an instant mix. With a lovely foam design served at the right temperature. Their coffee, freshly ground beans and made to other. Great as well. 

You begin looking at the menu and feeling a bit confused. Some ingredients are not something you see or hear about on an everyday basis. Or some of the combinations seem odd as well.  Don't let that turn you off! Ask away, their staff is very professional and knowledgeable. In both languages(English and French) 
I've ordered the Kyle's French toast(Great job Kyle!!) The dish consists of three thick stick shape slices of a lovely brioche bread. Drizzled with a sweet caramel like sauce and topped off with lovely compote of cranberries. Along side, a small but very beautiful decoration of butternut squash puree and walnuts. Served very hot with a hot dish. So the meal has no chance of getting cold.  Simply perfection in every single bite. 

My friend ordered the smoked mackerel(Which is a fish) The presentation once again was stunning. Great colour combination and beautifully presented. The mackerel was perfectly cooked, tender and flaky. Served with a duck egg, which was runny(Not too runny!) and tender. Finished by a lovely portion of cheddar polenta(cornmeal) which was silky, creamy, and perfectly cheesy. Decorated with chopped pickled cucumber. Perfect bite of freshness to end the meal!
Overall, this is not your ordinary breakfast spot,  this is extraordinary with very reasonable prices. Do keep in mind, that pancakes, sausages, scrambled eggs and heavy dishes are not part of their menu, not their food concept. Truly a fantastic place, with outstanding food, and very professional staff. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice terrasse for a weekend brunch. We got french toast(caramel sauce) and smoked Arctic char. Char is good, well grilled. French toast is not bad, tasted rich. However both portion are quite small, maybe we were just too hungry. Btw, children friendly."}
{"text":"Définitivement dans les meilleurs restaurants de Montréal, et parmi mon top 3 découverte 2014. On y est allé à 7 pour un anniversaire et on a tous été agréablement surpris. Après une mauvaise première expérience l'été dernier où j'avais étrangement été accueillie par les serveurs qui ne semblaient pas vouloir avoir plus de clients car leur terrasse était pleine mais le resto vide, nous avions décidé de quitter pour aller au Gemma. C'est suite à quelques commentaires exceptionnels d'amis qu'on a donné au resto une 2e chance. Ça a valu le coup! L'ambiance tamisée se prête bien aux soupers romantiques, ou de groupe. Le choix musical est par contre à retravailler. En ce qui concerne le service, professionnel, mais un peu lent. Un serveur de plus ne serait pas de trop. Maintenant pour la bouffe, wow! Nous avons partagé quelques entrées et le tartare de cerf et noisettes était impressionnant. Des saveurs auxquelles on ne s'attend pas. Pour les plats, une courte liste de choix, plusieurs de nous ont opté pour les pétoncles et ris de veau, mais j'ai goûté à d'autres plats, dont la côte, et tout était à la hauteur de nos attentes. Un peu cher, mais on mange bien au moins. Quelques jours plus tôt on était au Liverpool House et pour le prix, Salmigondis est nettement supérieur. L'expérience nous a fait penser à Tuck Shop (autre bonne place). Encore peu connue, cette place aura beaucoup de potentiel une fois bien rodée."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Definitely the beef tartar is worth a try and the service is outstanding. Not a bad cocktail list either (between 11-12$). Made the perfect date night. Would definitely come back for the filet a la moelle. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My high expectations were unfortunately not met. Not even close. Service was adequate and not up to par at all given the price point. The cocktails - one was good the other meh. Seafood chowder was good not great. Here's the biggest gripe. I had a piece of beef called wagyu (on the menu) which to me needs the melt your mouth. Not so at all. It was served with a celery root pure that was bland and bland spatzle. So disappointing.The other dish we had was the pheasant. Much better than the beef but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating here is very lovely. A great spot to enjoy the summer days and eat away your worries. 

We started off ordering all the appetizers I think, just because they all seemed quite interesting and we weren't really feeling the mains. The tomato salad was pretty mediocre to me, but maybe it's because I grow my own tomatoes. The tartare though was amazing, and very very delicious. As was the cauliflower. Actually the tomato salad was the only dish that I didn't enjoy. 

I would highly recommend trying out a dessert as well, because that was also sublime."}
{"text":"What a fail. I admit, we were a large group, about 12 people. However, the Resto was pretty quite and yet we still waited 2 hours for our first courses. Food was underwhelming, don't visit with high expectations."}
{"text":"When we arrived to the much anticipated Salmigondis for brunch and they had just seated the last available table in their outdoor seating area, bummer, cause it was beautiful out.  Nope, not bummer, because their super awesome Maitre'd was on point and actually brought a table from inside out and set it up for us; what a generous and truly accommodating gesture.  And boom off to a good start, straight out of the gate.  The service standard had been set and followed through our entire visit.  The menu is good, not overly inventive, but solid and surely offering an array of options; cocktails were very nice.  The food was good and everything was executed very well and the only reason I didn't go with 5 stars is because I need to have a real WOW factor to get me there, so I plan to return in hopes of grasping that wow and bringing this up one more notch.  Fine work being done at Salmigondis and I would surely recommend it, particularly when you can be seated on the patio.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"What an excellent recommendation from our Yelp community manager, Risa! Rather than going to my other favourite brunch spot in the Mile End, my boyfriend and I decided to check out this spot in little Italy.

Good: despite showing up late for brunch, they still welcomed us in. Since brunch hours was practically over, we didn't have to wait in line and got a table right away. The service was great, fast and friendly. I really like the decor here, a little rustic and chic at the same time. I also love that they have plants everywhere. My favourite was the Arctic Char, super fresh and exceptionally tasty. The fried rabbit waffle did not disappoint either, this was such a unique dish for brunch! I don't think I've been so impressed with a presentation of a brunch plate before.

Bad : While the menu was on the pricier side of brunch (anything over $18 a dish for breakfast is expensive to me), it was definitely worth trying.

Bottom line: this is a great place to take your guests to if you're hosting, it's guaranteed to impress. The food is fantastic and I will definitively come back."}
{"text":"Hot new spot in Italy Petite.  Nice decor, and great service.  Most of the dishes are small, and not a lot of options on the menu.  The dishes were a mix.  I enjoyed the venison."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Montreal! Menu is always changing but always amazing. Good value for the price. Nice patio in the summer"}
{"text":"We went for a spontaneous brunch on a Sunday and there was no line-up! I think the good thing about this place is it is a little bit far from downtown or the Plateau, so it is less packed. 

I really liked their open-kitchen and the decor of the restaurant, it gives a casual yet chic vibe. The only thing I didn't like was how close we were with the table next to us. 

We got the donuts and I didn't like them that much. The donuts were stuffed with lemon curt. Somehow the donuts had a taste of sweetness, sourness and saltiness (which was weird since saltiness was the first thing I tasted when I ate it)

I got their Blanc-Sablon Sea Trout (duck egg, cheddar polenta, broccolini, pickled cucumber). The trout was fresh and not over-grilled, I really like their polenta! It was so good!! It wasn't too salty and it complimented so well with everything on the dish (duck egg, trout, broccolini). I really enjoyed my dish but the portion was a bit small.. I was only 75-80% full after I finished it.

My friend ordered their Celery Root (poached eggs, Bleu d'Élizabeth, Flemish beauty pear, almond, nasturtium, celery jam). She had the option to add trout but she didn't. Overall, this dish was full of \"textures\"! You get crunchiness from the almond, juice from the pear, etc. I didn't like it that much although it was a quite special dish since I like to have meat or at least seafood for brunch/lunch/dinner.

My other friend got their Kyle's French Toast (butternut squash, goat cheese, cranberry, black walnut. This was aesthetically a beautiful dish! And it tasted pretty good as well (lots of textures and it wasn't too sweet). The french toasts were more like thick, crunchy yet soft \"biscotti\" in my opinion. 

My other friend got their Foie Gras Waffle (banana, chestnut, ginger clementine, lingonberry). This is another aesthetically gorgeous dish! I like how the cranberries added a sweet and sourness pop into the dish. It was a well-balanced dish (wasn't overwhelming even though it was foie gras)

Overall, we enjoyed our time there and the service was excellent. Our waiter was really attentive (when we didn't have any water, he would bring more without us asking) and friendly."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in little Italy. Brunch was absolutely wonderful at great price. Had a lovely eggs Benedict with pheasant. Manager was ever so gracious and pleasant. Highly recommend to any in search of an original brunch."}
{"text":"Heaven is brunch, here. Different than any contender. Artful plating. Casual vibes. Super friendly staff. Super accommodating of vegetarian or vegan diets. Super stellar cocktails that'll give you a 5-star brunch buzz. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've been to this cozy resto in Little Italy for dinner a few times and have never been disappointed! Although I still haven't had the pleasure of trying out their brunch menu, their dinner menu offers a greats selection of entrees and mains, and they always nail dessert! 

I was here with a friend on a Friday night and we were hangry, hence why I stopped taking pictures of the food after the two entrees and just gorged . We opted for the tasting menu at 65$ which allows you to share three entrees, two mains, and a plate of desserts. 

We started our evening with oysters and cocktails. The oysters were awesome but the cocktails lacked some punch. No worries, the wine selection is amazing and with help from our waiter, we settled for a bottle of Canadian Riesling. Canadian?? Yes, and it was fabulous! For our entrees we had the tomato salad, roasted cauliflower and shrimp. Delicious is an understatement; fresh, simply prepared with just a few ingredients, perfectly executed and plated made for a great start to the evening. For the mains, we went with the bavette and gnocchi dishes. Besides the generous portions, both dishes were super tasty; you've never had gnocchi likes this! At first we thought we had the wrong order because the gnocchi looked like giant scallops but one bite into the buttery and soft pasta and we were hooked! Lastly came the selection of desserts which included lemony donuts and chocolate cake pieces; at this point, we'd hardly finished our main dishes m, we were so full, but glad we saved space for a few bites of the donuts cause they were so so good! 

The dimly lit space, cozy space, and rustic decor make for a great \"romantic\" spot although two girls out for the night totally enjoyed the experience too! Service was great although being Good Friday for some, it was a little quieter than usual...

Totally recommend this place if you're looking for delicious food, great wine, and a great restaurant experience overall. Four stars only because the cocktails were weak and there was little confusion on our meal order (oysters arrived after our entrees and we had to ask) but nothing to ruin the evening."}
{"text":"Just an update to say I've become a brunch regular here, and it's awesome. Their cocktail gent is an artist, their coffee is great, the service is friendly and chill. I really really love the playfulness of the food and presentation. I was a bit bummed the last time I went that the jerusalem artichokes were hard, not quite cooked through, and the french toast not quite crispy in my favourite playful brunch dish. They were trying out some new over-the-top plating options that were quirky and fun, but I would rather have the focus stay on making perfect food, keeping everything else simple. 

Anyway, I love this beautiful spot and the young enthusiastic smart people making it work."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place amazing. I went there with three friends and we all agreed that the food here blew our minds. I had the \"French toast\" which is not normally something I would get, but it sounded so interesting that I had to try it. I'm so glad I did. It was wonderful beyond belief with a mix of textures and sweet & savory flavors that was perfectly balanced. The coffee and the service was superb as well. I don't easily get out a five star review but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday for brunch and we were seated on the patio which was lovely. There was no one sitting inside the restaurant but the decor was really nice.

I ordered the rabbit bénédictine on a lemon waffle. I really liked the lemon waffle...The citrus flavor was nice and refreshing. The rabbit was deep fried with good flavor and the meat was juicy. The dish was topped with greens and pickled asparagus...since I'm not a fan of pickled stuff I didn't eat the asparagus.

My friend ordered the lobster. I didn't taste it but my friend said it was good (portion was small).

It took quite a bit if time for our food to come but we didn't mind since we were not in a hurry..must make sure to keep in mind that service is a bit slow do don't go if you are starving.

Pricing is similar to any brunch place - $14-$19 per plate.

Would definitely come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Full stars here and totally deserved it. We ordered the tempura zucchini flower and French onion soup. Knowing that we were sharing everything, they split the soup into cute bowls! I have to say this is the perfect portion for one person. My girlfriend and I both shared the 33oz Wagyu steak and it was cooked to perfection. They were so impressed that they gave us complimentary fries and dessert (petit pot de creme). Their service was on point and I had to walk back to thank the whole team!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch based on recommendations from Montreal eater. Very solid brunch spot in the heart of little Italy. There was surprisingly no wait for a Saturday around 12:30 which we were very grateful as the days are only getting colder. 

This is a more 'artsy' brunch place, with about 6-7 items on the menu to choose from. Short menu but definitely enough diversity to satisfy anyones tastes. The decor is extremely charming and makes you fell inside a country house set in the 60's. Seating was very confortable also. 

We had the French toast which was served with goat cheese and butternut squash puree. Delicious! The presentation was very seasonal with cranberries and pecans. It screamed autumn on a plate.

The second dish we tried was the celeri-rave with blue cheese and poached eggs. We added a crispy trout for some more substance. The flavours on the dish were well balanced but all in all it was a 'light' dish despite the added fish. It probably won't satisfy anyone who skipped breakfast all morning for. 

We also tried their home made doughnuts with ricotta. So light and fluffy! They serve it with a caramel sauce that you'll probably want to lick off the plate.

All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience. The only drawback was the price. It cost us 60$ for 2 dishes, 2 coffee and a side of doughnuts. So probably not your every weekend brunch spot, but definitely a place to check out if you are looking to chance things up a little :)"}
{"text":"What a nice find, french cuisine in the heart of little Italy. The venison was amazing, perfectly cooked, tender and just enough herbs and spices. The cod was also excellent, blackened skin and pure white flaky meat. The sauce for the fish was a taste of heaven. Apparently the chef used to be nicked named \"Dr Gravy\". I also had the seafood chowder which was as good, and I hate to say this, better than the chowder at the Cabbie Shack in Plymouth. (Cabbie Shack has won many awards for its chowder). When the waiter brought the soup bowl there was no liquid, just a few well presented pieces of rainbow trout. The liquid was brought in a seperate container and the waiter poured it in the bowl. How cool is that. Desert was also very good. Who would of thought that popcorn and cheesecake would be so good. All the staff was great. Thank you for a great evening. P.S. the brunch menu looked very interesting, but that will be another time."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner and it was delicious, I've been here for brunch and it was wonderful. In the summer, the back, leafy terrasse is serene and positively lovely. The menu is fresh and you can tell they shop at the market and find what looks to be beautiful and fresh and work around it. It's a place that I feel comfortable with eating dinner on my own, which says a lot about the ambiance.  They don't go overboard on sauces, so you actually taste the food and there are a lot of choices here for vegetarians and non-meat eaters. Every single time I come here, I am Sound Hounding nearly every song, I totally love their playlist!"}
{"text":"The meal we had here was really underwhelming. We are a party of three: two of us had the attic char with eggs and cucumber salad, and the other had a tomato salad with ricotta toast. 

The tomato salad was heavily doused in some type of island dressing and pesto and balsamic. Three dressings on one dish? It was so overwhelming and messy, and very basic in flavor. The ricotta toast wasn't anything particularly interesting, either. Our serving of Arctic char consisted of cucumber salads in maybe (and unnecessarily) three different ways. The two poached eggs were very out of place just sitting off to the side - do you eat them with the salad, with the fish? Everything was just thrown together in this bowl-plate where  it all flooded together and you couldn't decipher anything that was going on (especially when servings were in-your-face large). The cucumbers were soggy from the puddle of grease and liquid and yogurt. Again, this was just messy and overwhelming! Nothing about it was cohesive at all.

We had the cheesecake and ricotta beignets for dessert. The cheesecake had an artificial/ medicinal cherry taste. Fortunately the earl grey caramel in the beignets welcomingly replaced the former's aftertaste. 

Overall the dishes were poorly balanced in flavors, poorly assembled, and very heavily hiding in sauces and grease. I was really looking forward to eating here after some great reviews, but the meal was just so underwhelming across the board. It was like they were trying to blend the Cheescake Factory with \"new age\" cuisine - very awkwardly. The restaurant came off as having a serious identity crisis. Nothing looked remotely like the beautiful photos we saw here (did they change chefs?); it was so unfortunate looking no one even wanted a photo! Not to mention the bland and redundant flavors. Quite frankly, there are significantly better places in Montreal for the price point."}
