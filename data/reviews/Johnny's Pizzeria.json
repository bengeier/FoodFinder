{"text":"Stayed in Vegas and needed a late night delivery place....Found this place on the EAT24 app. We were craving Philly Cheese Stakes so my BF and I each ordered one. They took FOREVER to get to our hotel and once they were there the delivery guy wasn't too smart as to trying to find our room. (In his defense it was a little confusing and quite dark) Once we got our food up to our room it was slightly cold....The sandwich had good flavor but it could've used more \"STUFF\". The filling inside of the bread was a little on the short side....and the bread was a little hard/burnt in some areas. But mostly good. I am a person who loves salt and doesn't mind it on my food....however, even for me the fries had waaaayyyy too much seasoning salt on them. It was like they poured it on and the top fell off and smothered the fries. My boyfriends were salted fine though...just mine were a little much. Overall, not too bad for a place that has free delivery and stays open pretty late. Good for Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really...waited an hr an 50 minutes, and they advertised 45-60 minutes. Go with Pizza Hut, as the quality was not that great. Pizza and burger was ordered. Shouild have went with my gut and got taco bell. Over prices, false advertising, poor quality food and poor customer service. I should have really listened to the reviews, that is my fault"}
{"text":"I've ordered $60 worth of meal to my hotel room after a long tiring day, waited 60 minutes (no problem with waiting time, we've been warned about it) finally got my pasta. I was super hungry, but there was no plastic fork (or anything) to eat the pasta. I called the place they offered to bring one but not with an apologetic tone!"}
{"text":"Luckily I like cold pizza, bc thats how it was delivered after 1 hr and 45 mins. Pick the pizza up if you want a hot one.  Pizza: 4/5  All the toppings were delicious but it was cold and not fresh tasting. Tasted like it sat for an hour in the guys car.  Delivery: 1/5  I dont care if its free, it still takes 1 hr 45 mins to the strip.   Price: 5/5  Unbeatable Under $15 a pizza with delivery tip."}
{"text":"Reasonable. Took about 1 hour to get delivery, pretty much right as estimated. Chicken wings were chicken wings, and fries were fries. Nothing really to brag or complain about. Service was decent as well."}
{"text":"omg so far my fav. place to get a white pizza from !! and the wings we so plump and tender !!   it was a amazing experience hot fresh LOTS of cheese great specials and the driver was SO nice !!"}
{"text":"I had to give one star because you have to.. I ordered the gyro with fries my wife ordered mozzarella sticks and a side salad ... Service was horrible we ordered water they didn't ask if we wanted bottle water charged us for the water ... My wife received two different types of ranch dressings and the mozzarella sticks sucked ... We will never go back here again"}
{"text":"the worse place ever to order food!!!!  i ordered a salad and they messed up really bad on it.  i paid $16 for it, when i called back to complain they told me that all they could do was to give me $5 credit for the next day.  i have called my credit card and cancelled the transaction.  very rude people, they shouldn't be in business at all."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we absolutely loved Pizza Time that used to be there. From the phone call to the pizza pick up, they weren't the friendliest staff. The woman behind the counter aired the previous owner of Pizza Time's dirty laundry while we waited for the pizza and it was uncomfortable. The pizza was okay. The sauce was good, but the crust was very thin and flimsy. It was difficult to eat because you can't even hold it. We were very displeased with the quality of the pizza for the price and won't be returning."}
{"text":"We live across the street so we ordered to pickup a cold Italian sub and a spinach and pepperoni calzone and I asked for two extra sides of ranch (this was all off of the Eat24 app) when I got here they said ranch was extra and that the amount I paid on the app didn't cover it. I'd didn't mind so I pains anyways.   When we got home the fries where a little stale and corner of the sub was a little soggy but over all it was alright. Not worth $9. The subs from subway taste better then this and they're only $5.   The calzone was the greasiest thing ever. It tasted alright but it was also kind of stale. It was pretty large. Maybe if it had been fresh made...  Oh and the \"ranch\" was SOOOOO WATERED DOWN LIKE MY GOODNESS. We opened it to pour some on the fries and it turned clear when it touched surface because it was so watered down.    We only spent about 24$ and it was a lot of food so I guess not too expensive but not worth it tbh"}
{"text":"Sooooooooo. We came tonight from Money Play.  It was crazy there and we couldn't get service.  The bar here wasn't as swamped and the drinks were the right price!  3.75 for a Cuervo silver and oj!    But the food.  We got 40 wings and a side of fries.  It came to 31.00.  Everything was so yummy!  Diana the server was really great.  She helped us a lot!."}
{"text":"Review based upon late night delivery...  Delivery took a bit longer than anticipated, although I'm not sure if I should attribute that to the EAT24 services or to the kitchen at Johnny's.  Just to be clear, the caprese salad is not what you're picturing in you're head.  Its a bed of greens, with some tomatoes and shredded mozzarella dribbled on top.  It wasn't necessarily bad, just untraditional and slightly misleading?  The pizza was cold and salty, but I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the toppings were tasty.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Carrot cake totally passable on as well.  Would not bother to order at this restaurant again, despite the free delivery fee and the late hours."}
{"text":"I had found this place on grubhub a while ago and finally decided to order dinner from them tonight.  I ordered a spinach & artichoke heart pizza and an appetizer combination platter.  The food was delivered in about an hour, after the delivery person drove away I opened the appetizer box and it was a cheeseburger.  I called immediately thinking the guy could turn around because my order was switched with another in his car.  The lady told me they would get the platter right out to me.  Well, here it is 3 hours later and they never came back, or called (phone number entered on grubhub.com).  Finally decided to heat up the cold cheeseburger and eat it.  Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"First of all- Did this establishment change names? I received a brochure in my apartment door about 2 weeks ago so today I decided to try it out. The Menu says 'All City Pizzeria' but has the same exact address as Johnny's pizza...so that alone is confusing as is. If I could give this establishment 0 stars I would have. I ordered my cheese steak sub and mozzarella sticks at 1:08 pm and was told it would be delivered in 40-45 minutes by the lady on the phone. I called at 2:30 PM because I still had not received my food and was told \"ummmmm, hang on.......... It left 10 minutes ago so it should be there in 5 - 10 minutes (click). Needless to say my food did not arrive at my door until 3:00. TWO HOURS AFTER ORDERING. The delivery boy didn't even have a pen on him so I had to search for one in my apartment to sign my receipt since I paid with a CC over the phone.  And of course, as expected, when I opened the bag of food, it was all cold and soggy and gross. I microwaved it to heat it up and try to salvage it. Took one bite of my mozz sticks- cheese was hard as a rock. I gave up on that and moved on to my cheese steak sub and I wouldn't say it was HORRIBLE but it certainly wasn't good by any means and the whole entire sub was just peppers, onions, and what tasted like fake cheese with a few scattered pieces of meat...... If i wanted a pepper and onion sub then I would have ordered a pepper and onion sub.. not a cheese steak! Anyway- I will never be ordering from this place again. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Food was not good. The chef needs to chill out with the garlic! I ordered the Alfredo pesto pasta with shrimp. It was so disgusting. Tiny mini shrimp and the Alfredo had raw garlic throughout. I couldn't eat it. It came with over buttered raw garlic bread, couldn't eat that either. Than the side salad with ranch dressing. The ranch was a paste and it tasted like raw garlic again. My husband ended up having delicious ribs and wings. They sent him the incorrect wing flavor. Recipes need to be fine tuned, add roasted garlic or be lighter on the garlic, add milk to dressing to thin it out, get rid of the small insect looking shrimp it's nauseating."}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone an was delivered a pizza. The pizza was mediocre. The cheese was dry and cheap. -- The Cobb Salad was also mediocre. The Ranch dressing was disgusting. -- The Chicken Pesto pasta was the worst. It had no flavor and was super dry... the pesto sauce had no flavor and (was not fresh) looked like it came out of a jar from the grocery store. The chicken was super dry and had no flavor as well. I will definitely not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza with a nice ambiance, vintage arcade games to pass the time while the home made pizza is being prepared."}
{"text":"Order from here often, and usually it's ok, but I know what I'm getting so it was not a big deal. Today, however, took the cake. I ordered a small pizza for delivery. What showed up was a doughy mess with some cheese melted on it...it looked like the crust was burnt so they cut it off and melted a new crust to it...it was beyond inedible."}
{"text":"WTF....this place is ridiculous we ordered 3 gyro sandwiches for $10/each and when I received our food...I promise you I could wrap my pita bread around that meat 3x's I had about 7 thinly sliced pieces of meat not even worth eating that thick ass pita bread!!   I was on vacation and when I visited again I will not be ordering for this place again..I would rather go to bed hungry! This was a waste of money"}
{"text":"My family wanted some true Sicilian style pizza while visiting from out of town. We stumbled upon Johnnys Pizzeria. It was truly amazing. The ingredients were fresh and the vegetables tasted as if they had been just picked. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the owner made us feel as though we had found home. I would highly recommend a visit or two."}
{"text":"The box that the pizza, calzone, or stramboli  will be delivered in will say \"fresh hot pizza\" rest assured this is a lie. The pizza may have a slight warmth to it. Expect garlic bread/ balls to be pretty cold and hard. I now understand that the foil around the marinara sauce is too keep it cold. (sarcasm).... The extra star is for the chocolate cake..... It was aight..... but yeah...was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"This was honestly one of the worst experiences with ordering delivery anywhere. My friends and I got into Vegas Thursday night and we decided to order delivery to our hotel room. We got almost $70 worth of food. When the driver got here, he was super rude and didn't seem to give a damn about anything. After breaking into the food, we were missing a portion of what we ordered. So I called to tell them that there was food missing and the person on the phone said they would have the driver send it. About 25 mins later,  I get a call saying they are now getting ready to close and they will not be sending me the food, which I already paid for! I asked for my money back, the workers were all snickering in the backround, and told me all they could do was give me credit for the next time I order. Unfortunately for me, I will not be ordering from them ever again."}
{"text":"So I finally ordered from this place after looking at the menu on eat24 website for awhile.  The menu is pretty standard:  pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken wings.  I ordered the medium wings which were super yummy with homemade ranch dressing on the side.  I also ordered a small 10\"pizza.  The pizza was just ok, kinda bland.  The only thing that made it good was it was the only place I know of around here I can order a small pizza, a true small, good when you don't feel like a huge pizza but still want a slice.  And the min order was only $10 with no delivery fee.  I don't mind delivery fees but some places charge way too much and you have to order a lot of food.  I will try this place again for sure."}
{"text":"Well the pizza was good but what a joke on the 8 dollar salad! Was hoping this was going to be my new go to spot, not so much. Oh and thanks for the pita bread squares to dip in my salad I guess?"}
{"text":"I wish we read reviews before we ordered. Someone slid a menu under our hotel door so we decided to try it. The person on the phone taking our order was very rude. She kept asking for the address but if you brought menus here dont you know where it is? Why is the name of the hotel not enough? She kept asking for my credit card number before I was done ordering. She said 45 minutes for delivery. After 90 mins I call back and she says the delivery man already left he will be there any minute and hung up. When he finally gets there the order is WRONG and there are no napkins or silverware. On a brighter note, the wings were good although they were not the flavor we ordered. The pizza was not hot and had a very fishy smell. We discovered it had shrimp on it which is weird because it was supposed to be a philly cheesesteak pizza. We also ordered a gondola. It looked pretty but we specifically said scrambled eggs but it came sunny side up.  We spent $70 and didn't even eat half of it because it was so wrong."}
{"text":"Tried them again for ribs. Very disappointing. Ribs were very fatty, sauce was terrible, sides were cold. Only upside, delivery was quick. I will not be calling again."}
{"text":"I ordered wings, a salad and garlic bread at 1am ... It said it was set to be delivered at 2:09 am. If they weren't gonna deliver it then they should've called the number I listed to let me know Instead of having me wait a whole damn hour .!!! I will call and complain in the morning because I do not appreciate being played around with .!! So rude ! No communication at all.!"}
{"text":"I have one word for this place -- DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!  I waited 3 hours and 50 minutes for my meal!  They claim to have attempted delivery once and not find me.  Really?  How hard is it to find a hotel?  They did give me the food free, but it was not worth it.  They brought the wrong dessert, and the bread in the sub was hard and overcooked.  There was practically no sauce on the sandwich despite my ordering extra sauce.  The food was also not hot but simply lukewarm.    It's a shame when I had to call multiple times to ask about where my food is.  They really seemed to care less.  The woman who first took my order promised me excellent food in about 45 minutes.  She was so wrong on every account.  My advice is to take your business elsewhere or else be prepared to get a headache from an extended wait with no food."}
{"text":"We arrived at this place just after 12.00 pm, empty no customer, Russian spoken in the kitchen - Pizza - Russian?? Very bright light over the table also hot inside and heat from the lamp.  Soda - in cans, no refills, ice bucket had tongs for each little cube to fish out. Pizza - so so, ingredients - not too fresh, I got the runs within 40 minutes leaving this place, not too clean - carpet looks dirty, need some cleaning. I verified if this is Johnny's pizza, which was confirmed, it does not look like a pizza place. I had a coupon for this place which was not accepted. Now I was told it has been changed to Inn Zone; however outside it is advertised as Johnny's pizza. Will not go back there. No wonder that place is empty.!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was another random delivery place we tried since it happened to stay open late.  The garlic balls were actually really good so we were not as upset that they had forgotten the marinara sauce.  A pet peeve of mine is when places that have take out service do not realize that salads need to be in a separate bag from the hot food and the salad arrives wilted and inedible...this is a business that did take the extra care to pack the salad separately, which is a plus.  The bf enjoyed his Cobb salad since it had the actual sliced blue cheese.  I ordered a burger and although the patty was fresh and thick, it was a bit undercooked (I asked for medium well and it was actually medium rare-I like my steaks medium rare, but ground beef needs to be cooked a bit more)...and there were no condiments on the burger at all!  It made for a forgettable burger since I do not care for bland, dry food.  The delivery was efficient and polite so we added a few bucks to the delivery charge.  The prices were comparable to the competitors...beats eating at an expensive establishment on the strip any day, especially on a night when we did not plan to go out.  This was one of the okay experiences we have had with the random pizza places we end up ordering from on a late weekday nigh when in town."}
{"text":"Delivery took an hr and a half after placing the order. Anytime I've ordered a pizza from other restaurants delivery was a lot faster. However my boyfriend and I were pleasantly pleased with the BBQ chicken pizza. The cheesy breadsticks were alrite, nothing special but the BBQ chicken pizza was one of the better pizzas we've had since moving here. We enjoyed the food but low stars for how long it took to deliver when my apartment was only a 3 minute drive from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger pretty good. Used eat24 app, went there in 10 minutes food was ready.... Good burger and fries..."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was sitting at the bar and asked to order a pizza from the place now called milanos and they took our order but never put it in until 30 minutes later and when they came out with the pizza after an hour they didn't even apologize or fix their mistake. They just said here and how much it cost. Very rude at milanos. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery...should have read yelp before doing so. DONT DO IT!! Terrible service, received the wrong food, gyro is just gross..they argued with us about the incorrect part of our order in 3 different  phone calls. At one point we could even hear the cook upset..GIVE ME A BREAK! If i could give no stars i would. When we received the \"corrected\" orders which was to be panini's they were on sub bread.."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and comparable prices to other pizzeria's in the area. I used to order from this pizzeria  many times and every time I got delicious food on time delivery."}
{"text":"I have been in Vegas for 3 weeks and have tried a few pizza places for late night delivery, all have been disappointing. Johnny's is the exception. Both times I have ordered the food came hot and fresh. I am not sure why it has poor reviews. I will surely order from them again, and so should you."}
{"text":"We called in an order online to be delivered to my Condo this afternoon. We decided on a white pizza, mild wings, mozzarella cheese sticks and cheese cake. The order came in a good time, the food was hot and very tasty and the delivery guy was cute. Too bad I was only in the mood to get stuffed with food that day.  It was a sweet and simple experience.   I attached photos..."}
