{"text":"During the ice storm weekend, we wanted to go out and eat but instead, we opted to get take out and eat in the comfort of our home. 

It was our first time ordering takeout at Fritter King and we ordered stir-fried beef rice noodle (????), salted fish & chicken fried rice (??????) and beef brisket lo mein (????). The server said it would be about 15 minutes, so we used the time to go to BTrust to buy a few things. By the time we returned, it was all ready to go.

The stir-fried beef rice noodle was oily and it is often expected because rice noodles stick to the wok very easily. Personally, I don't eat too salty and I liked that this dish had just enough seasoning. The salted fish & chicken fried rice smelled very good and it was quite tasty, but it was slightly dry. We know the beef brisket is always juicy and tender, but it was our first time ordering lo mein. I found the egg noodles were overcooked, not al dente, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Getting takeout from Fritter King is quick and easy. I'm sure you can call ahead and you will be able to pick up your order once you arrive. The food quality of the rice and noodle dishes seems to be about the same as if we were to dine-in, but I would assume their fried items would be a little soggy by the time you get home. 

We were actually back at Fritter King today for lunch, but we dined in again this time. We ordered our typical beef brisket vermicelli and poached pork liver. What was different today was an order of hot soya milk and we added dumplings to the beef brisket lo mein, but the dumplings were small and nothing special. Far from what we were expecting for $2.50, the hot soya milk actually came in their typical congee/noodle bowl. It was the perfect drink for everyone after a long cold walk from where we had to park, and the sweetness was spot on. We'll definitely be ordering hot soya milk again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here religiously for my Congee fix the past few years. The real reason why I come is for their Singapore style turnip cakes (+ chili sauce for extra deliciousness). I also really am a fan of their noodle rolls, they make them fresh and you can always watch them make it if you're bored.

In addition, they have a lot of different types of \"snacks\" ranging from deep fried dough to noodle rolls. Obviously, this place is carb filled since its Chinese food, but for breakfast? Who cares?

We got to the restaurant before the 12 o'clock rush, so we were seated very quickly. We ordered a Congee, the Singaporean style turnip cake, plain noodle roll and a deep fried cruller. The food came out very quickly and the food tasted fresher than usual. It fed both my fianc√© and myself quite nicely, we were both stuffed.

When the bill came, our total was:$19.45 +tip

Pretty good for a stuff your face, healthy-ish meal for 2."}
{"text":"FOOD: You could probably go to this restaurant for all meals for a straight month and you wouldn't have to eat any repeat dishes. Ok, I'm exaggerating a little but their menu is pretty impressive! I tend to go for my few favourites and add a new dish each time to try. I have yet to find anything I don't like. The dough fritter is a must try, as well as their freshly made soy milk (hot or cold). 

SERVICE: the service is nothing to brag about. The last time I went, I even had to set my own table... but that just adds to the experience of this place! They're extremely busy for weekend brunches but not too popular for dinner from what I've seen. 

COST: very good value! I can get lunch for two for less than $20, have left overs and be full for hours! (CASH ONLY!)

OVERALL: This place is great! It's been a safe backup option for me when I run out of ideas. There's free parking in the lot, but it gets busy on weekends since you would be fighting for spots with grocery shoppers."}
{"text":"Fritter King also means MSG King. They added way too much MSG in their plain congee. Almost needed an anitidote to help me wake up after I finished."}
{"text":"After walking in here today in the morning, I am set to say the experience with this restaurant is not what I expected.  

Starting of with the service, it was extremely horrible and slow!  When we first entered in, it took a while for the waiter to seat us and the restaurant wasn't even full yet, so there were plenty of tables.  But we had to wait just because the waiters were busy chatting among themselves.  After getting our menu and placing our order in, we waited 10 minutes after 10 minutes and our food wasn't even ready on our table yet.  The waiters just seemed like they could careless about the tables who ordered and still don't have their food served to them.  They just kept on \"LOUDLY\" chatting.  Their loudly chatting just made it so hard to stand as they show no respect what so ever as a waitress, I just felt like I was in a concert or something.  Who sees waitresses yelling on top of their throats to each other  in a restaurant?  I never did and would never want to experience that on my visit ever! Also, let's mention, the waitresses are also extremely rude, no manners, nothing whatsoever.  

For the food, it was meh. We ordered some Chicken Congee, Steam Rice Roll and a Glutinous Rice with Soya Sauce and Fritters.  The fritters were so dark, hard and it just didn't taste good at all!   The congee just tasted like water and it had loads of MSG, I guess that's what they call flavour.  While for the glutinous rice, it was extremely soggy it felt like it was steamed for days on and off during business as it could not be sold, yuck!  I personally do not recommend any of the items of the items I have tried.  For the price you are paying for these dishes, I really don't think it's worth it as the food itself is not even great at all! Save your money and try some other congee place!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. As far as you tiao is concerned I haven't ever found it soggy. I don't know a lot of things on the menu and stick to simple things, the seafood congee was quite good. They also open early and it's cheap!"}
{"text":"A Chinese girl's ultimate comfort food is congee, and I know I am not alone in this. 

The Fritter King (whose signage recalls a bit of Patty King) wins my heart with their huge bowls of thick, smooth rice porridge here with all the dressings. Seafood, preserved duck egg, pork, whatever you like it is here and delicious. However, there are slim pickings for the vegetarian, but good news! They ain't called the King of fritters for nothing. Their sweet and savoury fritters are made from a wonderful light but dense (and made right by the window) batter and delish for dunking in your big bowl of congee, or chomping on solo.

A very casual setting - sweatpants friendly, expect it to be busy in the afternoons, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"My husband loves their congee-  he said he could understand some would describe it as bland and more lumpy, but that's precisely why he loves it- it taste more like home cooked congee. I always liked their congee, but I recently discovered a new menu item- spicy chicken hotpot, delicious!!"}
{"text":"A pretty good place if you're looking for simple food: freshly made congee and rice noodle rolls. Fills you up without hurting your wallet. My personal favourites are the plain rice noodle roll and steamed turnip cake (it looks like a blobby mess but it tastes great). Congee is alright. 

I frequently go to this place whenever I feel like I've been eating too much greasy food and want some simple starches to 'cleanse' myself."}

{"text":"Great authentic Chinese restaurant. Yummy Congee, Fried noodles, Beef Brisket, and ofc their famous Fritters. Super cheap and fast service. Far from fancy, in fact, its quite outdated and the washrooms always stink. I knew the moment I walked in that it would remind me of Chinese street food. Im reminded of that everytime I come here and seem to enjoy it so much more."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner of the plaza we thought we would try this place.  Saturday at 1pm the place was full but we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.

Ordered a couple of the rice rolls, congee, and rice noodles with soya sauce. The rice rolls are freshly made and really good.  Noodles also tasty and full of sprouts and onions.  Congee for some strange reason took awhile to come.  Not worth the wait.  Did see a steady stream of pick up orders."}
{"text":"Meh.  They try to be a specialty shop with an expertise in Chinese dough fritters (the long ones that come with congee).  There is nothing wrong with their food. It is average and something I would eat if I couldn't decide.  My problem with it?

The Chinese dough fritters are not good. They come out dark brown and soggy.  For a place whose name is Fritter King, I expect better. 

Congee Dynasty has better dough fritters"}
{"text":"Don't expect good service but do expect great food! Traditional HK cafe style with authentic, fresh and delicious food. Some of the super star dishes include home made fritters, rice rolls, and beef brisket. The place draws quite a crowd over the weekend."}
{"text":"I wanted fried dough for breakfast and was told this is the place to go. I am so glad we came. The fried dough fritters are so fresh and delicious. It is one of the best I have ever had. I could eat this everyday. We also got some rice rolls. We got the pork liver, beef with enoki mushroom and beef with dough sticks. All were very good, I especially liked the pork liver rice roll. We also got the hot soy bean milk and it was great as well. The restaurant itself is a decent size with no fancy decor or tables. It's as basic as it gets but that's all you need when the food is good and the price is right. I will definitely make a stop here next time when I am back."}
{"text":"Food quality dropped a lot! Cheung fun was so soft that it fell apart the moment I picked it up.... the worse was we found sands in fuzzy melon dried shrimp hot pot. When my mom told them there was sand in the food they did not seem like to care. We also ordered fried rice noodle but it was NOT fried AT ALL! We really did not want to tip but we finally did and I swear this would be the last time!"}
{"text":"Chinese comfort food at its finest. This was my go-to place for a nice cheap and yummy fix usually in the early mornings or late afternoons.

This is a casual space that serve all the Chinese breakfast and lunch classics. Anything from congee or lo mein and stir frys; they've got you covered. Service is adequate and everything tastes on point. There's nothing here that will blow you away and creativity that's going to make you rethink food. It's just the classics done right and for a great price!"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming. Service is horrible and u practically have to chase down the waitress because they're too busy gossiping with each other.(Duck-duck-goose anyone?) 

The food is similar to consuming rubber. The soy milk is pretty good in all honesty, but second time here for the food and it's still a big no-no in my book. Last time they microwaved the food in front of me and it was still frozen in the middle. Should've gone for hungry-man instead last time. There's a handful of better eats in that same plaza so you'll have better luck elsewhere. Oil fritter is too thick and hard, but not crispy. Seems like they've over fried it because the shade isn't a golden shade but a darkened brown. Decor is non-existent but not surprisingly so given that Asian eats outside the western word rarely focus on decor and ambiance ,but solely the food itself. 

End of day, money better spent elsewhere is all I can say. Craving Asian oil fritters? Try Sam Woo at Mavis & Eglinton instead."}
{"text":"Very cheap Hong Kong style comfort food for good quality! Don't expect any VIP treatment, but you will get an experience similar to a son that's been living in the basement in a parents' house for too long.

When I come into this place, it feels like home because everyone speaks Cantonese. The chef is always brewing a huge pot of congee in the morning and you know that you're getting a fresh bowl when you order. The congee is piping hot and lightly seasoned with salt. I love the pork blood pudding congee with scallions and even the preserved eggs with pork. In an office where the AC is always on, this is the perfect breakfast to warm your tummy and throw at coworkers if they send you an email at 9am. 

Their milk tea is also on point but they always run out or they didn't make it that day (I order around 8:30 am everyday). Compared to Breakfast ING which is a 10 minute walk to the other plaza, this place's milk tea milkiness factor blew Breakfast ING out of the water. 

This place is amazing and I recommend visiting, Bring cash and debits as they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Another great lunch spot at the Golden Square plaza that I will frequent in the near future. I find that The Fritter King has a really good selection of traditional HK/Southern Chinese dishes (such as congee), but also general Chinese dishes that will satisfy a wide range of diners. 

The restaurant interior is very minimalist, no fancy decor to doll up the space, but hey, I'd rather take the low price point above high-end finishes. Almost everything on the menu was under $10, which is awesome for anyone who's on a budget and looking for a cheap place for a quick grab. Even the congee bowls and the Chinese donuts are cheaper than Chi's Congee, which is also at the same plaza. They have an open kitchen space at the front so you can look into how they are preparing your meal.

During my visit, we noticed that a lot of rice and noodle dishes has beef brisket, so we figured that this is their specialty. We ordered Beef Brisket with Tofu Skin on Rice and Beef Brisket with Rice Noodle Casserole. Just as we expected, the beef brisket was phenomenal, it was really tender and the sauce was really flavourful. Even though the meat was too salty on its own, but with the rice and noodle the flavour was just right.   

I'd definitely come back again to try out their congee items."}
{"text":"The price point is just right but the service sucks. The chinese lady was rude when we came in. We walked in and made eye contact with her and she looked like she was making a gesture to sit at a table so we walked over and she goes, why are you sitting here when there's so many tables around you?! First red flag. She never intended to seat us and ended up making rude comments. Second red flag was when we ordered and we asked whether we can have an extra bowl (to share the congee). Again, she makes a rude comment and she ends up tossing the bowls at our table. Definitely didn't have a pleasant time. We wouldn't come back to this place even if the food was good."}
{"text":"I went here because I read good reviews. I ordered congee with a fritter and hk style milk tea. I really liked the food, especially the congee. The place could look better but the food is great. Would definitely come here again for morning, afternoon of night for food. Definitely satisfied my craving for congee!"}
{"text":"I went there with my sister for lunch today. We ordered the beef noodle in hot pot and fritter, soy milk . Beef brisket noodle is really good, I love it. Brisket is so tender and falls apart easily and the sauce is so yummy. Fritter is hot and crispy and light!  Love it! I don't really care about service as long as they are not rude. Will go back for more!"}
{"text":"The best fish balls, scrambled eggs and shrimp. Excellent value for money. Not a very formal style, but great value for money.  
They take cash only no cards."}
{"text":"Situated in a busy plaza with lots of parking spaces. Chinese restaurant with no fancy decorations. You walked in seeing the front making and cooking fritters and congee. They made fritters and rice noodle fresh.

There are a lot of choices from rice, noodles, chicken, beef, etc. For the meat, seafood and vegetables section, there are options to order selection of dishes at cheaper price which also comes with a number bowl of rice. Everything we had were really good except for the hot and sour soup. It tastes more like sweet and sour soup, lacks some spice. We also had Cantonese chow mien, general tsao chicken, spicy salt tofu(not spicy more like crispy salted), stewed pork belly with preserved vegetables, and xo beef. What stood out is the Fritter rice rolls, it was served fresh, hot and crispy.  It was so good that we have to order again.

Service is good. I will definitely come back to try other dishes and specially their congee."}
{"text":"After a not-so-great experience at a neighbouring, very popular, competitor last time, I decided to check this place out!  The reviews sounded promising.  

And my thoughts after actually dining here?  Perfectly acceptable.  Atmosphere is really no frills here.  I did not venture into the WC, so cannot comment on the supposed smell.  Prices are low.

Highlights included:  Donut Stick ($1.70, quite good, fresh) and Rice Noodle Roll w/ Beef/Enoki ($4.25).

I found congee ($5)  itself a bit on the bland side.  I'm thinking that they water it down throughout the day.  Decent for a quick meal, but my mom would've criticised the crap out of it.  Just sayin'.  My mom is a really good cook.

Personally, I wouldn't be opposed to going again and trying their other Canto dishes, especially if the food of neighbouring, very popular, competitor continues to take a nosedive..."}
{"text":"While Fritter King is no fancy place, you may not necessarily want this to be a date night restaurant, it's great for when you want comfort in a bowl.  We ordered chicken congee, fritter, plain steamed rice noodle, and rice noodle with beef and enoki mushrooms.  The congee is the real deal, slow cooked, homey rice flavour, like your mom made it on the stove.  Good amount of chicken.
The fritter, one of the main reasons why I wanted to come.  There are few restaurants that make their own fritters.  Most just order from a factory that makes these fritters, and just  refries when ordered.  Their fritters are so fresh, and greaseless!  As i'm eating, I see people come in and to buy bags of them to take home.  I did the same a few days later, and my mom couldn't stop raving about them.
Of course we ordered steamed rice noodles.  It's the perfect meal companion to congee!  My favourite is the plain steamed rice noodle where you would douse with sweetened soy sauce, sesame sauce, hot sauce and sesame seeds.  So thin, soft and silky. They also make these fresh to order here as well.  You can watch them make them, as they make them in their open kitchen near the entrance.  As you eat it's like a mini show (they make the dough fritter and steamed rice noodle at the front of the restaurant, stir fried dishes are made in the back kitchen).  I have to say I didn't like the beef enoki rice noodle as much, the rice noodle was thicker.  I guess to hold up to the filling?"}
{"text":"Immediately upon walking in we were greeted with nice smiles and excellent service. 

We asked for extra peanuts/veges for our congee and they gave a very generous amount. 

Their fritter compliments their congee very much. Their portions are good size. 

It is inexpensive and reminds me of the coffee shops in hk. 

Fast and friendly service will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"-1 star immediately because it was freezing inside. There was no one else in there so that's a bit understandable but the temperature should at least be reasonable. I had to wear my winter coat.

The congee was decent. Nothing amazing. The plain rice roll we got was delicious though. They make it fresh. Everything else is ho hum."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??

Like its name, you have to try their Chinese fritters or the fried dough sticks. It comes freshly made and fried to order. 

Usually when it's fresh, the dough sticks are still hot and very crispy. 

They also make their rice rolls fresh to order too. You can order it with any ingredients inside but I usually like to order it plain. It's very popular to order it plain here and drizzle the rice rolls with different sauces (hoi sen sauce, peanut sauce, hot sauce) and top it off with some sesame seeds. 

This time I ordered with an ingredient inside and it's the fried dough sticks itself! Ooo so goood. 

They are also known for being a congee house meaning they specialize in many types of congee so next time you're in, order dough stick and congee. Chinese people love to dip their doughstick in the congee as they eat both. A very satisfying experience! 

The service here is generally very fast. You write down your order by listing the number corresponding to the food item you want and you give it to the waiter or waitress. 

Last tip?

Bring cash because they only take cash! If you order take out and you want to minimize your chances of chemicals in your body from the containers, you can opt to bring your own container for your take out here! Only weekends will they have the other fritter dough which is the sweet doughnut."}
{"text":"Look the Beef brisket it seem tough but they are soft. I tried to squeeze the hot sauce but the top of the hot sauce bottle fell off and lots of the hot sauce spill on top of my noodles. 
The fried bread is hot and moist. In hot days like this I think is better if they are give us the ice cold tea instead the hot tea."}
