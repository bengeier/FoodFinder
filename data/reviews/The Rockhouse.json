{"text":"I had high hopes for this bar, considering I love dive bars, drinking games, pub food, etc...  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience completely.  We had a girl named Christine. Normally, I'd expect attractive waitresses at such a place (which Christine is not; she didn't even wear the uniform every other girl working did, but looked dumpy like she had been up for weeks and wore a hoody) - but it doesn't matter as long as they are friendly and good at their job. Christine is definitely neither!  Let's see:  - Unfriendly (gave off that 'I hate my job, why am I here' vibe  - Asked her 5+ times to see if they could put on a specific hockey game (with 80 TVs and it being early/empty, this shouldn't be a problem; but every time I asked her she looked like it was a brand new request and forgot). Never got to see the game.  - Was super slow to take our order, deliver the drinks and never brought water my friend asked for repeatedly.  - Asked her if the drinking games offered/promoted were every night or only certain nights; she didn't know and apparently couldn't find out (because she obviously never bothered asking anyone)  - Grabbed a plate of food I was still eating and took it away while I stared at her in shock/laughing. She didn't ask if I was done and it was pretty obvious I was still eating it when she just swiped the plate.  - Took over 30 minutes when asked to bring the bill; never brought it. We had to get another waitress to help us. Then our bill was completely wrong, over-charged for happy hour drinks, etc... and it took her another 15+ minutes standing at the register trying to figure out how to correct it.  On top of everything else, we tried a sampling of various food (fried pickles, sliders, tacos and boneless buffalo wings) and the food was very bland and sub-par for bar food.  For a place I *should* love hanging out at, this place failed miserably. I might return is I could receive a guarantee Christine wasn't working and we'd have a different server..."}
{"text":"Great vibe, would have loved to see a band playing though, they told us that they do have live music, we just unfortunately missed it.  Other than that awesome people and drinks, bartender Whitney was really hilarious. We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I had a good time here last night, full bar, fun layout.  It was mellow when we showed up, but got pretty packed/busy by the time I left.   There's a variety of seating options and a ton of TVs, so I can't wait to check it out for Football season.  I enjoyed the Chicken Avocado sliders and our bartender Lisa was very cool.  And beautiful!  This place delivers on the hot chicks for staff theme.  I had her mix me up a Mind Eraser and it was delicious.    Also funny was that it being on the strip, a gang of British dudes rolled in and couldn't get enough of the mechanical bull - haha!   And if you're looking for Beer Pong, they've got it too.    Anyway, I dug it.  They seem to have hit a nice balance for tourists and locals."}
{"text":"Went here during the lunch hours, maybe only 2 other tables had customers, no hostess greater us so we kind of sat our selves. We sat for about 10-15 minutes with no-one acknowledging us at all and finally the hostess asked us if anyone had spoke to us. We said no and she explained the one waitress for the 3-4 tables was also the only bartender...what? Needless to say, not impressed."}
{"text":"There's this server there named Porsche shes so bubbly and energetic i loved how attentive and concerned she was i will definitely be returning to rockhouse the food wasn't that great but the customer service was 5 star.."}
{"text":"Just watched Absinthe at Caesars and walking back to my Pallazo suite and a guy at the door of Rock House offered free drink with purchase. Great music playing so me and company gave it a try. This place is a MUST ON YOUR  ITINERARY.  heather w. was our waitress and went beyond the norm of making our party welcome with great service. She's definitely an asset. When you visit ask for her. They have instead of a mechanical bull to ride a rooster to ride. As I write this review I'm thinking one more shot and I might brave it for a Facebook op. Sliders are kick adds too."}
{"text":"Hey everyone I don't often write a review unless I truly have had a great experience. The food is amazing, especially the tacos and the local beers on tap are really great. Also we came back again and the had open bar all day for 50 bucks for when I had friends in town.  We came back for the nightlife part since we had the open bar wristbands and was a fun time. I mean it's not a mega nightclub, but a fun place to drink and play beer pong and shuffle board. Also they have a giant rooster(cock) to ride instead of a bull so all the hot girls were on it lol hilarious stuff. Guys and girls I highly recommend stopping in to watch any pro sports and to grab a drink thumbs up"}
{"text":"Don't buy their $50 all you can drink, they change the rules on what you can drink, bottom shelf, horrible customer service, waitresses don't know what they're doing, bartenders don't know how to mix drinks, management is disgusting"}
{"text":"The place is really nice has good atmosphere. Although some of the waitresses could use some touch ups. She was not very helpful and our food came 45 min later cold! The general manager was very nice very helpful"}
{"text":"Boring. This place was dead and they still wanted to charge a cover fee. Their service is awful even with the place completely empty. It took them 30 minutes to bring our order. The security guys are a bunch of losers. With their little power they act like bullies. I put my head down for a second. Wasn't sleep or anything. Just rested it on the table. Get told I can't sleep in there. Not my fault this place is lame."}
{"text":"DON'T ever go to this bar, especially for any event!  Ditto on all 1 star comments for Super Bowl Sunday event.  Hundreds of people waiting in line for over an hour and still miss the kickoff.  We reserved a table (which included unlimited drinks 1 hour prior to kickoff - but NONE given) even got a confirmation from Lauren (event director), yet when we finally got to the front to be seated, they did NOT have my name on the list!  We could not be accomodated so found a nicer comfortable lounge in Palazzo.  Benjamin T. (5 star review) you either work for the company, know someone there or one of the rare lucky few who was serviced.  I can guarantee 90% of those who attended were not happy of how the event was organized, but most won't waste their time writing a review.  This place doesn't deserve being in a property as Venetian.  The locals in my group will NEVER recommend this place to anyone.  Wish could give it minus stars!"}
{"text":"We were there in happyhour and there should be 30% discount for appetizers. When we get the bill, there was no 30% discount. Then i mention about this and they give e new bill and said now there is 30% off, but there was only 15% off. Restrooms was really dirty. There was pee all over the floor. The waiter is serving foods and clean toilets awhile. It's miracle if you survive without food illness in this place. I give this place 0 star."}
{"text":"Atmosphere didn't bother me; when we showed up we were three of five white people in the place, the others looked terrified lol. Waitress didn't know what a Thug Passion was and then asked if we were looking for drugs. All that was fine because the music was good and people were having fun. But one weak-ass drink sent us packing. If you don't know how to make cocktails then maybe stick to beer and wine."}
{"text":"The veggie sliders and margaritas are amazing! Good place for tourists, great promos."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on the strip. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Ask for Carissa. Best bartender on the strip, and gorgeous :)"}
{"text":"had a vip no line all u can drink wristband well worth it. amy is the best she always made sure my drinks were full and takes the time to talk with her customers.  I also ordered food I had the fried pickles which were great and the wings also great."}
{"text":"In Vegas for Super Bowl and my buddies and I stopped in at the Rock House to have some drinks and get something to eat.  We were promptly seated by the hostess and it went downhill from there.  We waited nearly 20 minutes before a waitress showed up.  We had waited so long we had all decided what we were going to eat in addition to our drinks.  She took our drink orders but refused to take our food order also.  Another 10 minutes elapsed before our drinks arrived by another waitress who also declined to take our food order.  We waited approximately 30 minutes before another waitress showed up to take our food order.  The ironic thing is the restaurant was nearly empty.  Food arrived rather quick but it was so bad I could not finish my chicken and avocado sliders.  It tasted like gas station food.  I asked for the tab so I could get out of there because the service and food  was so bad.  It took nearly an hour.  I finally got a hold of two separate servers before our bill was presented.  I do not recomemmend Rock House.  There is an obvious problem with management and training.  Staff was rude.  Bottom line, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"IGOR.rocks. Helped me out a lot and gave 2 for 1 drink stubs. Awesome person. Great place to party for local and tourists love it be back again!"}
{"text":"Rock house, rocks!!! Amazing place at Ventian see you again guys, great management, hospitality from greater - promoter Igor started the fun 2 for 1 drinks.. food inexpensive as highest cost 11.95... per person. .. thanks everyone again..."}
{"text":"All i can say is wow. Great and disappointed. They falsely told us about cigar smoking and then the arrangements  was horrible."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place a little worried about the look of this place at The Venetian. Yes call me a prude but much to my expectation and the saying never judge the book by its cover I had nothing but a fantastic experience. The bartender Anthony was nothing but wonderful. He had a decent crowd but was very attentive to all his customers. He Didn't seem stressed and had a smile on his face regardless of the pressure from Sema and trust me I know Sema I am here for it.  The Rockhouse may get a 3 star from me only because of the food but Anthony a 5 star. So whoever reads this please ask for him."}
{"text":"The manager refused to change the channel to the game which we requested. Instead, the local news was on for about an hour. She had a horrible attitude all four times that we interacted with her.  Customer service at its finest!"}
{"text":"We were walking toward venetian when a young lady asked us to come in for taco Tuesdays.  At first we were reluctant but then said ok.  So glad we did.  Taco Tuesdays was 1.50 and the host brought out a huge connect four for the kids.  We wouldn't had known the place was kid and adult friendly had it not been for the hostess who invited us in.  Thanks so much,  we will come back here every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Too loud.  Have been here twice with so so experience (both Tuesday night). Bring your own crew and you'll have the place to yourself.  Bathrooms were in desperate need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"I don't think this place  even requires one star. The service sucks here. Not worth the wait and differently not inviting. The managers don't understand the phrase \"the customer is always right \"  save your money and go to Denny's ask for Carolina she'll take care of you. And best believe I will keep writing bad reviews till this place stars go down."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I made an yelp account just so I inform all those fortunate enough to not experience this restaurant's service. I walked in with my coworkers and was promptly ignored after being lured in by one of their staff offering a lunch discount. Don't be fooled by their 15% discount, it was a waste of time, might as well have paid full price instead of being lied to. We sat down and then half an hour went by before we got our drink order in. We then ordered and sat for an hour and a half bordering on two hours before leaving because they didn't have our food ready. It's hot dogs and salads. What are they doing, growing lettuce and feeding livestock for meat?!  The manager came and pretty much just said we can leave after we express how unhappy we were. Looking around before leaving, we realized the groups that came in around the same time as us were just as unhappy with the treatment. Empty drinks everywhere and no food to be seen."}
{"text":"Bad service!  I knew they are new, but that's no reason for servers not to know the menu and drinks...hello... you specialize in your frozen drinks and the server had no idea what they were like. \"I don't know what it taste like, but the description sounds good\".  The food came and then plates and utensils put on our table to set up ourselves.  I know it's a casual place, but really?!?!  So maybe only recommended for beer pong..."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for Sunday NFL football! $50 all you can drink house and only $75 for top shelf. I think its the deal of a life time if you are watching games all day. The food is bar food but pretty good quality. Make sure to sit in Niki's section -- She's a super cool gal and great server. We had a group of like 12 football fans and she kept full drinks in our hands all day! I'll definitely go back on my return to LV."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars.  This business was not prepared for the superbowl VIP reservations.  No system and total disregard for their supposed VIP customers.  The management was nowhere to be found when customers were asking to explain the situation.  Completely unacceptable and no sense of customer service.  We paid reservations for a VIP table and they made us wait outside 45 mins and missed kickoff."}
{"text":"Said it was world famous burgers! Plain burger is $10.50  by plain I mean no extras like cheese, bacon etc., they don't have pickles and fries are extra! Fries are $2 and greasy a side of chilli $2 in a little 2oz plastic container.  $3 12oz bottle of water and no coin change, bills only!! Wth is that!  IN n Out is much more flavorful and cheaper!!!  Our waitress was nice, but I'm sorry I would never suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever, and management is disorganized and rude. We had paid $150 per person for super bowl reservations, and showed up over an hour early to wait in line. After waiting an hour, we were still hundreds of people away from the door and decided to leave and go to the bar across the hall to avoid missing the start of the game. The worst part was just how rude management was, and the fact that the owners were hiding inside not dealing with the hundreds of angry/disappointed patrons. I would never return here."}
{"text":".e've been to Rockhouse a few times while visiting Vegas and it seems to have a schizophrenic personality. Last time we went it was quiet, classic rock was mixed in with 90s pop and there was a mechanical bull.  This time we TRIED to go back and have a few drinks after dinner only to be told of a cover charge, and drink minimums. Going in to find friends I was greeted by rowdy college age kids playing beer pong and completely drowned put by EDM blaring over any attempt at conversation. .good thing for hand signals as we left within the space of 1 over DJ'D pop song.  Guess we will stick to the small bar area outside the main club rooms..  If you are over 30, arent dressed for a strip club and aren't into EDM .. go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Good vibe, good music, a good first stop of the night. Overall, it was fun and unpretentious unlike many of the clubs. No cover, and got in for free drinks!"}
{"text":"One word - unexpected. On the surface a place that tags itself as an \"ultra-dive bar\" with a hot dog and taco menu, a mechanical bull, beer pong and a pool table has little appeal to me.  But it's also in the Venetian which usually means a snooty bartender will take 9 minutes to make a 13 ingredient, $21 martini. Expensive \"celebrity\" chef snoots-ville is a Venetian specialty.  However this down to earth little gem is in the Venetian and nothing is infused, crushed or foamed and that suits me just fine.      It was really fun, the music was great, the food was scrumptious and because it is in the Venetian I didn't have to get a hep-c vaccine or up my hobo-stab insurance to brave some sketchy parking lot to get there.          Food wise what I would expect from a bar is some crappy frozen, reheated garbage on a plastic plate.  It was on a plastic plate but it was fricking delicious.  Under protest I tried the mini chili cheese hotdogs.  Chili and cheese usually gives me heartburn and because I don't really like chili cheese hotdogs it's not worth it so I avoid them.  But I tried these and they were so good I went back a couple days later and ordered them again, this time armed with a handful of Tums to maximize enjoyment.  And they have soft-serve ice-cream - yum.     What was also unexpected is that admittedly on the surface I appear to be a \"corporate type\" and I thought this place would be full of \"dirt-bag types.\"  It wasn't.  The crowd ranges the socioeconomic spectrum which makes for a great atmosphere.  There were a few more English dudes there than I would have liked, but I also think there was some weird convention that week.      There are a couple of things to be aware of.  There was prolific use of a smoke machine by the DJ - a little The Beach circa 1999.  If you have a couple drinks and then become tempted to get on the mechanical bull, think twice.  I saw a couple of ladies scamper on that thing and it was not hot.  More like awkward dry-humping.  But in those ladies defenses they did appear to think they looked pretty sexy.  Also some of the cocktail waitresses' outfits were not the most becoming (i.e. pudgy stripper).  Maybe someone should have an uncomfortable conversation with a couple of them, but I was told by my male companions they were all hot and I was crazy.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was the second stop on our club crawl. I was a little surprised to see this place in the Venetian on the list as it was kinda divey with a mechanical bull and sickly sweet drinks, but we had just come from Senor Frogs, so I shouldn't judge. As part of the crawl, we had gotten a free drink ticket. I was really happy to find that the drink that they made me, a vodka cranberry, was in no way lacking in alcohol. I was pretty happy with it. By this time in the crawl, my fiance and I had made friends with a giant family reunion party and we all had a great time sitting around and watch people get clobbered by the mechanical bull. Beware ladies! This bull (and its controller) are totally misogynistic and will do everything in their power to make things jiggle, bounce and ride up. Do NOT get on this thing in you are in a short dress, cause chances are that you'll be putting on a hell of a lot more of a show than you bargained for."}
{"text":"Great little bar only missing a better view or patio seating as well as Groupon and the internet have two different address's. We took a lyft there but because of address being different we where dropped off 3 hotels away. Oh and the car pool table was cool at one point but it's now beat up and very uneven but again nice one and the skinny blk girl at bar could hold a nice conversation."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on Saturday nights! I'm not a club persons so it's nice to have a place we're the music and the talent is great. Dj Dynamixx and Mc Babae really put on a superb show! They make you want to get up and dance! The bartenders make great drinks and they are not watered down. Overall the place rocks!"}
{"text":"The burgers and onion rings here are absolutely HORRIBLE. Don't eat here...you are better off eating McD's!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service - messed our order up three times.  Philly sliders were cold.  Nachos have squeeze cheese and cold chicken.  Can't understand why they can't deliver on such a tiny menu if simple bar food.  Manager was unprofessional and saving seats for his personal friends as waitresses were trying to seat guests."}
{"text":"The groupon was a a great save 4 hours of open bar for less than $20  We had Justin as a a bartender and he was amazing!! He said he was new but he worked like a master great conversation and served us great drinks when we needed them! The manager was also ready available to help with anything she needed to. Most restaurants you don't see a manager unless there's a problem but the manager here we saw 3 times for minor things like tv channel changes and music. 5 stars would recommend to any Las Vegas new comer or resident we got great suggestions from the support staff that mad this trip even better! Please give this place a try it'll be worth your time!"}
{"text":"At the Sands Convention Center on 1/19/17 for the SHOT Show.  It's about 1:00 pm and I'm hangry.  The food on the convention floor is a joke, expensive and of school cafeteria quality.  Staff is ummm....unhelpful.  So I venture out into the world of all the Venetian has to offer....and it is lines and lines of hangry men.  All the way past B&B Burger To Go(which I dearly wanted to try).....so I go past Bouchon Bakery cart up to Rockhouse and....no lines(should have known)  The very cool and very curvy hostess takes me to a nice table in the bar, and I get to spread out all my shit and relax for a minute.....relaxation comes at a cost my friends.....$11.00 for a standard Captain n' Coke.  That's right....ELEVEN DOLLARS!  That is more than they charge at the airport.  These were not tall drinks either, served in a rocks glass.  Beware.  They do have a $50.00 all-you-can drink special, but I was not in that frame of mind...was at this show for business.  Anyway, had the Tijuana Mini Hot Dogs to eat($12.95 for 3) and they were super-duper, yes they were!!!!-quite a bit larger than a Smokey Link , bacon wrapped and fried on a teeny, but tasty bun with avo, pico de gallo(fresh!), grilled jalapeno, pineapple and a ribbon of sour cream.  Damn this was a welcome surprise!!!!  Sadly, the Jalapeno Poppers($8.95 for 6) were not.  Average at best.  Here's the thing.  They charge $7.95 for an order of waffle cut fries, which I dearly wanted with my hot dogs, but will not do a half order, and there was no way I was gonna do a full....so I got the poppers as a greasy, crunchy foil to the quite elevated taste of the TJ hot dogs.  They were ok.  I left two on the plate.  Break it down-  Ambiance/Cleanliness---Fake corporate dive bar on the Strip.  Cleanliness was \"ok\", but just. Decent bathrooms, paper towel dispenser was out. Tables were sticky....3 stars.  Service-\"ok\" but just.  Server was sorta chunky in Daisy Dukes and not very helpful/surly.  I think I saw fire shoot out of her nostrils when I asked about a 1/2 order of fries.  Can't get the image out of my brain. 2 stars.  Food-see above.....2 stars....bill was like $50.00.....was expecting about $25.00-$30.00.  Never going back for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Mahi Mahi tacos minus the Mahi Mahi due to my vegetarian/vegan diet and I was left with cucumbers and tomatoes. It was surprisingly good. The ingredients were fresh and the tortillas were warmed up to just the right temperature. I would eat there again. Again if I knew how to give 3&1/2 stars I would but I don't so I'll give 4."}
{"text":"I don't usually write bad reviews unless businesses really screw up. We were at this place to watch the Super Bowl and had reserved a table for 6 a month in advance. We paid $175 per person for a table which was supposed to be by the bar area according to the girl over the phone. We made sure to get there early so we can get a good seat. When we got there the place was almost empty and names were already written for tables. We were put in the back room at a small table where the tv was barely visible. We politely asked for the manager and told him we were promised a table in the bar area. He was the rudest manager and said \"you have two choices. 1. Keep the table. 2. Leave and be charged half of the reservation @175 per person\" there were plenty of tables open and he could've swapped us for another party since our reservation was made a month in advance. We continued to ask him for a better seat and he just walked away. We asked to see our agreement and he sent a security guard to kick us out. The only nice person in the whole place was the security guard who understood that our seating was pretty bad. I would never step foot in this place. With so many places in Vegas there is no need to go here. I only have 1 star because there was no option for zero.   Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Menu is good. Prices are fair for the strip. Bartenders are horrible and rude at the new location in the Venetian. I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"This bar is classified as a \"dive bar\". Seriously? On the strip, in the venitian, trendy food menu, bathroom attendants. Sorry even by Vegas standards that is not a dive bar. That said, for a sports bar on the strip, this is pretty decent. Good college football coverage, decent food, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.. Horrible service. Rude staff. Especially the manager.   We paid for bottle service and a VIP area. They had an AC issues in our area only. After 3 hours of requesting a resolution to the issue. A solution was not possible.  We asked for a coin promise from the manager. She was rude and insulting.  The entire bar had cleared out on a Friday night before midnight because of the heat.  She refused to accommodate anyone.  We will never return.   All the manager had to do was move us to a level cation in the bar that did have AC. She was horrible and rude the manager would not even attempt to maintain our business. Pathetic.   Plus for a rock house you would expect rock not hip hop played all night."}
{"text":"Came here for the \"Best burger in Vegas\" and was rewarded with over an hour wait for a cheeseburger. No large party, no complicated order.  A friggin cheeseburger. 2 tables that were seated after me asked if I wanted some of their food because they knew that I had been waiting so long. Multiple servers told some that they were checking on my order.....with no follow up.  Did I mention that I never got silverware or napkins?  Even after my food showed up. Meal was comped by the manager who was totally apologetic but an average burger."}
{"text":"Stayed in the Palazzo at my last visit to Las Vegas. The Rockhouse was the first alcoholic icee place we ran into so we decided to try it out. It's definitely more sweet and less alcoholic than the famous Fat Tuesday's. I got a 32 oz and barely caught a buzz!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first day visiting Rockhouse. I rarely write reviews. As an owner of bars, I only write reviews when they deserve a 5 star and Rockhouse deserves just that. Their manager Danielle is as good as it gets (I am biased, she is a Yankee fan). She was welcoming and warm and went above and beyond yesterday for myself and my guests (one day I will be stealing her from you lol). The bartender Steve and his barback Dan, as good as it gets. They were attentive, gregarious and sincere and worked a very busy bar like dogs. The food was good and the atmosphere was great. As a local and bar owner? I strongly recommend Rockhouse. Great times. Thank you people...  Stephan Galdau OWL"}
{"text":"Buyer beware.   Rockhouse is issuing Groupon's without the intent of honoring them.   They will offer you another deal when you present you Groupon but not what they sold online.  I didn't want to debate the ethics of this practice while on vacation, nor did I want to argue about drinks in Vegas where cocktails are abundant.  So I left and went to the next place.  Save yourself any hassle and avoid.    There are plenty of other places to enjoy.  I have notified Groupon also."}
{"text":"Never even heard of it, but I was dead set on finding this place. It is on the second floor inside the north part of the Venetian, and what it is - is a replica of a dream vision of a dive bar. This is NOT a dive bar, but it caters to those who wants one and yet feel the need to stay on the strip. This place is awesome. I will come back here.   I came here on a Sunday, and just so happen they have a $25 breakfast item, plus open bar until 4pm deal. My breakfast tacos was tasty, and I washed it down with way too many rum&cokes. There was a live band that took odd requests, like \"Sing Hotel California in Spanish\".. and they delivered. One patron asked if he could slap the skins for a few songs, and they let him up and drum for a while. It was super laid back and really cool.  This will be a place I will return to, when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very disappointed so far with my experience here. My husband, gf and I paid $50 a person to reserve seats for the game on Sunday. We came in right at 10 and we were told we could watch any game. We asked that the channel be changed for the Seahawks and they at first couldn't find it.   We eventually found out we had to wait for the stupid game before it up end which had gone into OT.   One would think that as a sports bar they would have the sports package on tv that would allow them to watch any game.   Regardless we ordered bloody Mary's (horrible and chunky) and some food while waiting to watch our game. After missing the entire first quarter we finally got to see our game.   Food came:  flavor flav chicken (3 stars), chips and guacamole (chips were stale), spinach artichoke dip(horrid), jalapeño poppers (so so)... and the topper, I ordered ice cream and they were out. I truly feel like this has been the biggest waste of my time and money since coming up Vegas. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We came in for $1.5 (Some were $2) tacos and $5 margaritas.  The tacos were good, nothing exceptional but for $2 or less they were good.  We were in and out pretty quickly, nothing really inviting about the place - but it was nice for a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"Went here 4 days straight while in VEGAS!!  This place cracks me up though! The bartenders are cool enough! But the girls that work the doors are hilarious. To see girls using hula hoops to get people to come inside and check this spot out is just FUNNY! I do not recall a time when a hula hoop has made me want to go anywhere!!!!! But, I guess entertainment is what it is all about.   As far as service here, the drinks are good but overpriced which is to be expected in Vegas, especially at place on the strip!! But, the drinks are moderately strong so you get somewhat of a BANG for your buck. If you want to save get BEER if you want to get mixed drink expect to spend MORE!!!   The DJ and dance scene is fairly good. Didn't have to worry about sloppy drunks or stumbling on the dance floor which is a nice change compared to other places. Everyone seems either too drunk to dance or just lightly buzzed and rockin out on the floor.   Good times. Oh, there is a pool table that is modeled after a car here as well!! If you get a chance to play on it please do it! Just for the experience if not for anything else. The music is mostly modern hip hop so expect all the most recent tunes and hits to be played while busting some SWEET moves!  #breakitdown #bustamove #shotshotshotshotshotshot"}
{"text":"Had my Wedding dinner here on February 13th. Unfortunately we had a misunderstanding initially about where we would be set up, but Johnny was professional, understanding and gracious! Everything worked out in the end. The food was great, drink went down like water and it was a great success! Thanks again Johnny!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I have ever seen while visiting Vegas. A group of friends came here to watch the hockey playoffs and if you're hungry, highly recommend you find another bar. Manager tried to make it right, but it was to late."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday and it was taco Tuesday.   It was a launch point for our evening.   Service was not on their b game let alone a game.  We had to walk to bar to locate waitress several times.  She'd deliver one order and walk off without taking order of other people who had met at table (party of 8) after she took first order   Maybe it gets better as the evening warms up but for kicking things off and getting some bland tacos with no sauce options other than what's in a packet it wasn't that impressive."}
{"text":"After (a now former) buddy of mine ruined our chances to get into Tao, he insisted on making it up to me by bringing us here. I can tell you right now, this is NO club Tao. It comes nowhere close to a nice Vegas experience. When we came here, it was empty. The place had the vibe of a bro bar, an experience I can get back home in California. But I persisted here through the night, to see if anything great came up. Nope. The crowd came, and filled up with a crowd that is not my type. The place turned out to be a mix between a bro bar and a ghetto hip hop club. Even my old bud finally came to realize that it was a bad choice to come here. We took off shortly thereafter. I see the concept behind this place, but it is not a concept for me. Thanks anyway, folks."}
{"text":"Worst service on The Strip. You couldn't get drunk here if you wanted to, I was sitting at the bar with an empty drink and the bartender walked by I don't know how many times without asking if I wanted another."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was at the old location in front of Imperial Palace and I just checked it out yesterday and still love it. The location inside of the Venetian isn't the greatest, but the venue itself if pretty cool. Awesome pool tables and beer pong tables and so many TV's plus a mechanical bull... aaaaaand a cage you can hang from (see photo.) We all ordered the tacos and they were pretty damn good. You can pay $50 for open bar all day. They also have buy 1 get 1 happy hour well drinks. Mechanical bull is free to ride  for women and $5 for guys. We had a very good time even though it was kind of dead for a Sunday afternoon. Hopefully they promote it a little better to get more people in... Even if they don't I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I would prefer to give this dump 0 stars. Bad food, horrible service, and on top of that they tried to rip us off. Paid $175 for seats to watch superbowl with open bar service. The waitress was non-existant and we had to wait 30 mins/pitcher of beer at the bar. When we got our bill at the end of the game it included a built in 20% gratuity....$150! Took another hour to find a manager to argue with to get it removed. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Claimed to be a \"sports bar\" but it's really just a night club.  Some promotor took us through the VIP experience which meant the waitress didn't even acknowledge us.  We left with out ordering one thing."}
{"text":"I believe its illegal to state a deal and then not uphold said deal....or wait, we are in Vegas so maybe that is legal? Whatever....THE DEAL WITH HAPPY HOUR SAYS ALL APPS 30% OFF. We ordered chips and salsa at $4 and the waiter said \"oh, those arent 30% off because they're already cheap\".  THE ONLY REASON WE ORDERED ANYTHING AT ALL WAS BECAUSE OF THE \"DEAL\"  Advertising SHOULD read: All apps EXCEPT chips and salsa!   A-Holes!"}
{"text":"Great fun.  Good food. Lots of tv's.   staff was friendly and service was excellent.  Nothing to complain about at the Rockhouse."}
{"text":"We went in for a casual drink in the evening with friends. It turned out to be one of the best part of our trip to Vegas. Elizabeth (with the BATMAN tatoo) is one of the best bar tender I have met . She is full of energy and knows how to  keep the place alive. Kudos to her. We will definitely come back to this place whenever we are in Vegas. Great place for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Rock house is just the best. Amazing service and food and everything. Incredible music, this place gets vegas #loveelizabeth"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in Vegas and heard about 80's Night with a Live Band karaoke on Tuesday nights.  It was so much fun! The band was pretty decent considering the some of the \"singers\" but we enjoyed ourselves and danced and danced.  It was Taco Tuesday so we had tacos and they were pretty good.  My only complaint - why are there no vegan/vegetarian tacos offered on the Taco Tuesday menu?"}
{"text":"We came here to see the Spazmatics on Wednesday, and had a blast! My husband doesn't dance, but there wasn't a shortage of other people to make friends and dance with. The band was ridiculously fun, and really involved in making sure we all had a good time.  Be careful with that all-day drinking groupon, though! They are very generous with the pours, and our server always refilled our glasses prior to finishing the previous ones.  I don't really recommend the food- it's a bit too junky, even for bar food. We had the loaded french fries and wings, and didn't much care for them.  I guess that's okay, because one of the drunk, dancing gentlemen kept dancing up to our table and actually stole bites of food from our plates. He really seemed to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon deal. An all day wristband that allows u unlimited cocktails (draft beers, well drink and wine) for $24.99. Thought this was an awesome deal especially because their beers are $7 each. When we first arrived we were escorted by the friendly hostess to the bar area in the rear. There was 1 bartender at the time (a  short black girl with glasses, sorry cant remember her name, but she appeared to be the only black girl working there at that time)... I wasnt too worried about there only being 1 bartender because it was only about 5 people in the bar at that time. She asked for our IDs, we showed them and soon as we informed her that we had groupon deals its like her attitude completely changed! It took her LITERALLY 20mins to give us a cran & vodka. Keep in mind there were only about 5people at the bar (not including us, party of 2)!!!!! We watched her wait on a small group of women (4 older ladies), who entered the bar about 10mins AFTER we did, while we still hadnt received our cran and vodka order.  We didnt even bother to order food here because her service was so BAD! We took our 1 drink and left. We grabbed a bite from another hotel and went back about 1 1/2 hours later hoping she would have a better attitude and we'd get better service. WRONG!!! This time there were about 7 or 8 people at the bar... We grabbed 2 of the many seats open at the bar, the same bartender walked past us at least 3 time without even acknowledging us. We sat for another 5mins before she walked over to 2 girls that were sitting beside us (who had just finished their meal, drinks and were getting ready to pay the bill) & held a 10min convo with them, still not asking if we needed to order or cared for a drink! We got up and went to the bar in the front dining area of this place (which was closed the 1st time we came in earlier) & we were greeted and served right away! The bartender in the rear ruined the experience for us and we wont be back if shes bartending."}
{"text":"Came here for an event that was supposed to be four hours long, we all left after one. The best part of this bar was the DJ that we hired. The staff was extremely condescending and rude. The manager and bouncers were unfriendly to the point where it seemed like we should feel lucky to be in their bar. I got snapped at by the manager for holding a beer and a mixed drink in my hand... She threatened to kick me out. Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Drinks are overpriced but strong. Service is friendly but mediocre and the food is okay but I've had better. . Overall not my favorite but if your a 20 something female you'll prolly do okay. There's a mechanical bull free for chick's guys pay 5 bucks.  I'll just wait for Saddle Ranch Chophouse to open."}
{"text":"Glad to hear they reopened and relocated The Rockhouse. We went there for the all you can drink all day since we got a Groupon for $29.99. Good deal and good times."}
{"text":"I come here every Tuesday for the tacos which are a great price great variety and taste delicious, a combo that can't be beat. Also the beer pong tourney is great fun where you play and mingle with locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Methinks not indeed. I'd skip it. This is a spot in the Venetian. You have to exit the casino, though, to access it as it's only accessible from outside, not inside. And it sure seems like a random place to have at a place like the Venetian. One of these things is not like the other... It's a real classy place with sticky floors, sticky chairs, and scantily-clad server and bartenders. Oh, and the food is crappy and over-priced. But if you've ever wanted to ride a mechanical rooster (as opposed to a mechanical bull), this is your spot.  I came here for the Rockstar Karaoke. Meh. Awesome band and karaoke. Crappy place for it. The stage is small and oddly shaped. And there's really nowhere you can sit that actually gives you a view of the stage. There's a small dance floor area right in front of the stage. But here's the kicker: it's also right in front of the main (and only) entrance! So you get to fight your way through a bunch of dancing drunk people to get in and out of the place. It's like running a gauntlet. No thanks.  When you enter, they entice you with 2-for-1 drink cards. I ordered from the bartender and handed her my card. I ordered again and handed her another card. I get the bill and I didn't get my drinks as 2-for-1. I eavesdrop on her convo with the guy sitting next to me at the bar and hear her tell him it's not good for any of the drinks on the specials board. He tries to hand her the card and she stops him and tells him this. I hand her not one, but two, cards and she takes them and says nothing. And then hands me a bill charging me for all the drinks. WTF? Oh, and it took me 30 minutes to get a menu from her, no exaggeration. And she never came back over to ask if I wanted anything.  To make matters worse, when my credit card charge went through on my account, they added a $1 to the amount I had signed for! And then they processed a 2nd charge for $4.32! I remain completely clueless as to what that charge was for. WTF?!  Yeah, to say my experience here was not pleasant would be an understatement. Not a fun place. Not an enjoyable place. So many problems with this spot."}
{"text":"This is not a dive bar.  It's a lame tourist trap.  We came on a Tuesday night around 9:30 p.m. and they had one waitress working the whole room, which had probably six tables of people.  How do I say this nicely?  She was a nice enough person, but should probably find another profession.  I say this as a former waitress who was not very good and one who recognizes the talent and hard work of good waitresses.  Honey, you need to move, move, move!   The burgers were mediocre, the fries were awful, and the onion rings were inedible.  If it weren't for the manager who was busting his ass trying to make up for the waitress, the place would get one star from me.  He really tried hard.  But there's only so much you can do."}
{"text":"The Rockhouse, located in the Venetian, really exceeded my expectations for a number of reasons:  1. We had table service and our waitress came over regularly to check on us. She frequently cleared our table and would check to make sure our juice canisters and ice buckets were filled. Ever been to most places in Hollywood or anywhere else in Vegas? Rarely happens unless you're spending your children's college tuition or you look like Thor. Then, you'll probably get great service.  2. The manager was also really attentive. He kept coming to our tables and checking on us. Again, super rare in Vegas and in Venetian, no less.  3. The bouncer or door man was friendly and funny.    4. DJ Slip rocked the house. Yay for old school hip hop.   5. Our private area had video game machines for tables! Near the front of the bar were a bunch of pool tables. And, for those looking for a bit of adventure or a good workout, there's a mechanical bull and some stripper poles.   6. Finally, for $40, you can get unlimited drinks. And since our waitress was so attentive, everyone who took advantage of this offer in our group got their money's worth. (What a deal compared to the $11 that I paid at the pool for a virgin pina colada! Grrrr.)"}
{"text":"The staff at this location are more interested in talking to friends and coworkers than providing customer service. After standing at the bar for ten minutes she decided to ask if we needed anything.   The place didn't see very clean and there was a pool table that had some very young children who were throwing pool balls around. I feel that the staff should deal with this situation. After we ordered a beer, I took it to go. Beer was cold and with a yelp check in you can get one free."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.   I saw good reviews which lead me here.  Party of 8.  2 birthdays.  We ordered street tacos, frys, hot wings.     Almost 1.5 hours later we got half our table fed.   Cold tacos.   Very disappointed.     Although bartenders were awsome.  Special drinks served to order.  Our server was also awesome she kept apologizing.       2 hours later.    Tacos left behind.  Wings were good everyone ate that.   Game bar....packed.......why. bartenders.   Drinks.           I give 2 because of the kitchen.     Change it.  Get a new head of kitchen.       Then and only then will you get 5."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! i found it while buzzed and walking down the strip and the workers there are so enthusiastic and friendly! They have a mechanical bull and you get to ride it for free! Even the customers are super enthusiastic. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday and the tacos were delish...too bad that's the only positive thing this business has going. They advertise their business buy handing out cards that lure you in with the \"buy one, get one\" cocktail offer. Soon as I entered I waited for a host to seat me. After 5 minutes I decided to ask a bus boy who told me to seat myself. Menus were never offered but I was able to see the taco menu and decided I would just order those...if I ever got a server. Took about 10 minutes but I finally ordered. Tacos were good. Ordered a miller lite and my son ordered a Sierra Mist. I told the server about the 2 for 1 drink card I had and she had the nerve to try and comp my son's soda instead of giving me another beer!  who does that? So over this place and will never be back...EVER!"}
{"text":"First impression was that they are not organized  they don't know what is going on I made a reservation they did not know were we were suppose to be what bottles we ordered it was just a hot mess but when they got it together they didn't charge us for the bottle for the inconvenience so that was nice of them but overall it's a fun place to go to we had a good time plenty of things to do there"}
{"text":"Allow me to preface this review - I hate leaving negative feedback for any business, as a business owner myself and someone who has volunteered to serve the business community for 10+ years.  Sadly, this situation warrants blasting them instead of having fun, but I like to have fun.  Rockhouse, where do we even begin? Maybe your name should have warned us? Ever since the 80's the LAPD has been trying to knock places with this name down with the batterram; I guess they missed this one due to the terrible location in the middle of 2 major resort properties hidden in the frightfully designed mall?  Tuesday night (12/19/17) After taking a Lyft ride over from Elara where we were staying; we trekked from Palazzo through the cavernous, empty and rather pointless mall towards Rockhouse; excited to redeem our groupon after a lackluster evening the night before at ameriCAN bar at the Linq. After walking nearly half an hour (no exaggeration, really) we finally found Rockhouse.  We were dying of thirst and hungry.  All the TV's in front were on, even though the glorified garage door was down.  Wife said \"oh wow they are closed\"; I am the eternal optimist and said \"maybe just the mall bar is closed since the mall is so empty?\" We were both half right; we tried the large door to the left of the mall bar, it was OPEN!  We excited went in, there was music on!  Several feet into the bar it was evident they were closed even though we were clearly inside the building.  There were what appeared to be those \"bottled water cone cup\" paper cone things over all the bottles in the well and on the shelf. I suggested to my wife that since we were there for an open bar promo, maybe this place just had a self-service vibe and things were just slow? (some all inclusive resorts have self-service bars after all) However, I looked at the website (gotta love smartphones) and found that the hours are \"closed at 10 on mon/tues\" so figured there would be no \"livening up\" tonight. So beside the pathetic nature of drinking alone (although I really did wanna play shuffleboard with her) and missing out on the social nature of a bar; we made the more reasonable choice and left without messing with anything - did I mention there was NO SIGNAGE outside about being shut down for the holidays?  Oh yea I didn't mention that but indeer there was NOT (nor any mention on social media or the website) Wound up having an underwhelming dinner at PrimeBurger and getting a Lyft elsewhere. Thanks for that unnecessary $17 in rides that night. I also made a madbro post on their social media about being closed, no response even today, Saturday, as I write this review. (although they did finally post on the 21st that they are \"closed till the 26th\" wow great job guys!!  After a rather extensive search of social media, we decided Wednesday night would be better!  Maybe people had called off or maybe there was a private event scheduled on Tuesday and execution was just off.  We learned there is a live band on Wednesdays and Rockhouse is open till 2am!  The addition of a cheap open bar special meant there should be plenty of new friends to hang out with - ok let's go!! Whip out the phone, hail the driver, and crawl into the prius or other subcompact you deal with lol.  This time we went to the Venetian to see if hopefully the map was right and the walk was shorter. (I am disabled with a below knee amputation and all the walking of Vegas was starting to get to me a bit) My guess regarding the walk distance was maybe right maybe wrong...I swear this place is exactly in the middle.  Especially loved the overly aggressive people from Tahiti Village we had to fend off at 2 points in the mall from this direction - real upscale Mr. Adelson. Once we vanquished the crusaders, and crossed the river (canal) and crested the mountains; we found Rockhouse again.  CLOSED and locked up tight this time. Right after we started walking away, this casually dressed guy came out.  I approached him and asked him what was going on with the place? I was starting think they got busted by ABC for serving minors or something and was really curious. He explained \"oh, you know we are closed for the holiday\" (I guess we look like locals?) I was all \"nah bruh, I don't know, but I do now\". I then griped at him about the lack of notification and he could only muster a \"not my job\". Another $17 in rides and tons of unnecessary walking, all because someone can't be bothered to post notice on the website, social media, or AT THE VENUE.  So now our week long trip is over, we have this Rockhouse Groupon we can not use, nor do we recommend anyone get it; or waste their time going there. Probably as sad and pathetic as their other place ameriCAN where they write your name on and make you use the same cup all night with the threat of $5 if you lose or break it? We have previously gone to PBR at PH, which is kinda cool and has nice staff."}
{"text":"Rockhouse was one of the only bars/eateries available for a last-minute dinner booking during CES, but they clearly weren't ready for the traffic. The maitre d was surprised that we had a dinner booking. That was the first warning.  My colleague and I waited a long time for service. The waitstaff was swamped, so after 45 minutes, we flagged down a maitre d to take our order. They brought our drinks out soon after, but after we waited 30 minutes for our food, a real waitress came by to check if our food ever came (no).  Once the waitress found us, everything went fine, but in all, it took 90 minutes before got our food.  The burgers were thin and overcooked (we asked for medium)."}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap.  Typical bad management and over priced Vegas Strip bar/restaurant.  Not worth going."}
{"text":"Amateur hour. This place sold reservations for the Superbowl for upwards of $150 per person. Ten minutes before game time and their check in process is so slow there's a line down the hallway 200 people long. We went to the desk and were repeatedly told they'd get everyone in on time but the line never moved. Minutes before kickoff we had to make a mad dash back to our rooms just to see the game. To make matters worse, when the crowd got impatient they pulled their staff inside and stuck security guards at the door because they couldn't handle the increasingly angry customers. Pathetic. Unprofessional. Unforgivable. We came into town just to see the Superbowl and had hundreds of other options, most of which were cheaper, but we passed because they reassured us they'd pull through. Steer clear of these amateurs."}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday lunch and it was great! Had the margarita too! All great! Super fast service too!"}
{"text":"Ordered Nachos.  Then Paradise Fish Tacos. This is not real food. Microwaved crap.  Do not eat here under any circumstances -- you've been warned!"}
{"text":"This is spot to be on Saturday night!!! Best DJ / MC combo that turns this bar into an awesome party!!!! Free shots are given out, the music is dope, the Dj is on point, The MC keeps the party hype and the people involved! Go-Go dancers, nice view of the strip and the food is awesome too!!!! Come through!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 on a Sunday afternoon. Not that busy. They asked if we wanted lemons in our water, we all said yes and they all had limes. They forgot 2 orders of food we placed. We ended up canceling one of them because it took so long after they realized they forgot them. The nachos had great potential but the cheese was the cheap orange sauce out of a can. I tried a chicken taco and it was not very good. The table of 6 behind us had 3 of their orders screwed up as well. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the coolest bars I've been to. We love going here because the vibe is so good. None of the pretentiousness of some places nearby. The karaoke and the beer pong is fun. The prices are fair, and the employees are all friendly. Will be back"}
{"text":"8:30 am on a Sunday morning brunch. $5 bloody mary while everyone is still waking up from night before in vegas.  $5 bloody mary and free shuffle board. Little digs with eggs and cheese. Not a bad place for cheap food in the morning    Heard is a rocking bar and night club also. That is for another time."}
{"text":"As we neared the Wynn hotel, cards for the Rockhouse were coming at us like bees to honey. Feeling a tad hungry we decided to give it a whirl and I am glad we did. Far from a dive bar, you could consider The Rockhouse a laid back and unpretentious bar environment.   The cards I mentioned before, were intended specfically to promote drink specials which I could not completely wrap my mind around after a being over-served Bloody Mary's at the sports book.  The Rock Me Like a Hurricane was a double Bacardi and Amaretto drink which was over priced at $12.00 even with the free draft beer, which was the hook of the cards. But I can not complain as our server Marisa was up to the task of great recommendations and a freebie after we ordered another round. The Buffalo Smokin' Hot Wings were fairly priced at $11.95 for ten very plump and fresh wings and tasted as though they were pre-grilled then deep-fried prior to the sauce being added. Although I believe my exact quote was \"Gimme your hottest wing and make 'em hurt\" I was not suffering any heat pains which oddly is a feeling I enjoy. The Steak and Pickle Taco's oozed grease and the pickles were not the vegetable I would have complimented the very nice pieces of carne asada steak bits. The chef came out personally to deliver my wings with a smile that could illuminate the Mines of Moria (Lord of the Rings reference). and went back in the kitchen to get me an additional side of blue cheese at no additional charge. If the same request was given to a chef in my area, you had better duck and quick as a frying pan could be heading your way via airmail."}
{"text":"Good drinks here as this was our second bar/club to hit before the party really got started. Of course 9:30 pm was way to early to get the party started, but again, good drinks and bar staff!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for the Laughter Ahead comedy show. We thought we'd get something to eat while we waited for the first act to come out and we weren't impressed with the food. $13 for three little sliders. We thought they were going to come with fries or something, given the price, but no sides. Their food is ok, but I think it's overpriced. I probably wouldn't eat there again. The comedy show had a few good jokes, but a lot of it, I wasn't laughing at. The crowd was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Ashley & Genevieve are the best bartenders I have ever had ! I came back everyday and the food and service was great! Very personal service! Great music, And theres a cock to ride!  85 TV's with every sports channel! This house does rock!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed very rude staff I came down from Los angels 4/27/18 with a group of people we were invited to the Rockhouse Due to a couple of DJ's that performs in Los angels one of the DJ name is Dj paradise very rude guy a few of us paid online for a VIP table which they gave away we paid 160.00   omg customer service was horrible  I can't understand why I had to talk to him anyway !! Where is  the manger that never came and talk to me !!  then if you wanted a drink you would be standing at the bar for ever it was a hot mess  ps...still haven't talk to any one about my money"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The free drink was a half drink the food was gross and the service was awful. Wings were dry and gave cs massive diarrhea and the nachos \" were actually and also gave cs massive diarhea DO NOT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was so damn good I forgot to take a picture of it. We stopped in to share a burger and some wings and both were great. We opted to have the sauce on the side and went with the bacon cheeseburger. Wings were meaty and juicy. The burger felt like it was ran through a grinder 100 times as it just merged with the soft bun and oozed into every bite. we sat at the bar because we like to hit and run and service with Bridget was great. Pretty decent stop."}
{"text":"Given free passes to what turned out to be an amazing Wednesday night, with a DJ playing hits from the '80s and the adorable Spazmatics. I prefer DJs to live bands but the Spazmatics were phenomenal. Plus each band member was as cute as a button. Modern day Beastie Boys/Rock band.  Great place for a quick pick me up. Especially if you're having a bad week, and/or you're dying for the weekend."}
{"text":"Two waitresses behind the bar at 830pm.  This also isn't a dive bar.   Looks cool inside and has good seating but service was slow."}
{"text":"Great food, phenomenal service. Will recommend to everyone!!! Kat is a great asset to Rockhouse she makes you feel like you're being entertained at someones home.  Note, yelp asked me to finish this review, no idea why it didn't post, it's from Feb 2013"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and great staff! A special thanks to Johnny the D.O for taking care of us so well and the batenders for being so awesome and accommodating. We will be back ! Thanks again for making my mom's birthday so special!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Fri 2:30-6pm  Best thing about Rockhouse happy hour is it starts at 2:30.  That is one of the earlier HH's on the strip.  Their HH special is 30% off appetizers and 50% off specialty cocktails.  Not bad.  I ordered a Rock Me Like A Hurricane and my friend got a Sweet Emotions.  The drinks were good and a great deal at 50% off.  For food we ordered Chicken Nachos, Spinach Artichoke Dip and 3 of their Hump Day Hotdog sliders.  Food was good.  Nothing special.  If you are on a HH crawl I would save the food for another stop.  Service was attentive.  Overall, not a bad place for a happy hour, especially if you are starting early."}
{"text":"Decent location for casual partying.  There were ladies just outside handing out free passes, and you could buy a wristband for $40 that gave all-you-can-drink domestics and wells just inside.  Not a bad deal, considering cost of cocktails in Vegas.  The dance floor is next to a long bar in a non-smoking area when you first walk in.  You can head to the back half of Rockhouse toward the bathrooms, and there's a whole other bar where smoking is allowed, there's a cheetah cloth half-car pool table, beer pong, Jenga, and a stripper pole.  Only one bartender at this bar on a Friday night, so service got kinda slow as the place got busy, cuz our bartender was spread too thin.  Otherwise, good music and a good time."}
{"text":"When a bar on the strip is completely empty for most of the (Friday) night, AND you regret buying an all-you-can-drink pass on Groupon with 20% off coupon, something must be terribly wrong.   The Good: All-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers (mostly IPA's) on draft as well as wine and well drinks. Several TVs available playing various sports matches.   The Bad and the Ugly: All-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers (mostly IPA's) on draft as well as wine and well drinks. Not many session beers on tap. Well drinks are low quality. Unfriendly service and manager who acted like we were bothering him while getting our wristbands.   The live music was alright, but the place remained empty all night. I'd rather pay full price for decent drinks and a better atmosphere elsewhere."}
{"text":"Vodka lover... so was ecstatic over their Thursday drink specials... 2 dollar vodka and cranberry!! It was awesome to have found such a chill place.. With Great music and cheap drinks AT THE VENETIAN! Wow..  Also tried the Scooby Snack drink.. Was oohhh sooo delicious !! Will definitely revisit when back in vegas"}

{"text":"I hosted my bff's bachelorette party here on 4/23/15 and had a BLAST! I set it up ahead of time so there was no wait in line. We were escorted in by our super awesome bartender. She intoroduced us to some of the staff there then sat us at a seat that was perfect for our group. The drink and food service was fast and the baartender was very involved in our crowd - making sure we were smiling, getting us all to dance, posing for pics with us, etc. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to have a laid back good time!"}
{"text":"This is spot is good for enjoying sports.  My husband said it was really loud in there. But we didn't mind.  We were lured in by a friendly hostess who gave me a couple of drink coupons.  So, we went in and the drinks are pretty good, not your average cheap liquor that you don't taste or feel. I'm not giving this higher ratings, because it is not a place that I need to visit, unless I want to go in with a larger group to watch some sports.  Plus, in Vegas.....well you have big screens throughout the casinos and can run around watching the game anywhere, while having some drinks.  My husband said that the bartender was attentive and served us up really well.  I recommend this spot for anyone who wants to have fun with the guys."}
{"text":"Got the all day drinking pass..never wanted to serve us. Waited an hour for food..never coming here again. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"My girlfriend's and I really enjoyed this place's 2 for 1 drink specials, laid back atmosphere, friendly and speedy staff and music. All of the specialty drinks are a MUST TRY. I tried the carne asada salad which I felt was different. My only complaint about the salad was the steak wasn't marinated long enough. The meat was very tough for it to be flank steak. Besides that minor detail this is a great starter bar before you go party ."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good bar in Vegas but ever single place I looked up, 3 and half stars so I said f.... it Imma try Rockhouse and I Loved it, the Bar tender was awesome, the music is bad ass, a little bit of everything. I don't really need a high crowd to know where I'm gonna enjoy myself and Rockhouse is the place."}
{"text":"The decor was rocking. I ordered the build your own fish tacos and to my surprise I got three mini tacos. The tacos were ok. I had better. The service was slow. The White Russian drink was delicious. I feel that the prices for the food was too much for the small portion."}
{"text":"Nerd status: it's a neat concept on their karaoke night - they provide a live back up band!   We were looking for something to do after the Rock of Ages show, attempting to make our way to another casino and BAM we walked right past this place. I saw the \"live band karaoke\" sign and knew we had to go in; our friends who live in Vegas are HUGE karaoke fans, the husband is a great singer.   So yeah, definitely the vibe of a dive bar... there's beer pong but that's common in Vegas so we were used to it. They had IPA's along with your standard Coors or Bud.   Our server was great - very attentive."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to watch some football and eat lunch on the Sunday before the New Year... you would expect a place like this, on the Vegas Strip, to be busy, right? It wasn't. Now we know why...  Customer service, customer service, customer service.  No sense of urgency at all, ever, the entire visit. We had to ask for a round of waters 3 times. It took far too long to have our order taken. Our server was \"friendly\", but clearly lacked any genuine concern and was pretty apathetic...   We had such stellar service our whole trip, but this particular establishment left a bad taste in our mouths. Pun intended."}
{"text":"83 TV's is nice but then it's not so nice. Football playoff's and the half time entertainment had a guy yelling into the mike with the blown speakers : Geeze, back off the mike a few inches at least . As well they did not stop when the 3rd qrt began. The beer: so-so. A fleck of debris in my pitcher & our server was willing to yes her finger to scoop it out.... So no reason to replace the beer  Food: bar food and eat it sparingly. Choose this as when most else is not available"}
{"text":"Standard dive bar, unique for Vegas, but not for any city located between Denver and Memphis. Beer pong and mechanical bull."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday...wasn't too packed. I suppose those who don't want to wait in line at Tao end up coming here....that was my impression of the crowd I witnessed...but I could've cared less...I was there to celebrate a friend's b'day.   The drinks are expensive ($7 for a beer, $12-$14 for an 8oz. mixed drink), but that's nothing new for the strip. I remember asking one of the bartenders for a glass of water, and he looked at me like I was asking for too much. He literally poured me a shot of water, handed it to me, expecting me to get a kick at his \"sense of humor\". C'mon dude. Just gimmie what I asked for. I'm not here to witness your attempt at comedy. (As haughty as that may sound...)    The DJ seriously sucked that night. He played  a few good songs, but he didn't know how to make smooth transitions between songs.  I like that they've got a couple of beer pong tables right next to the mechanical bull and smokers can puff away right on the other side of that.  Oh yeah! The lady in the women's bathroom is a darling!! She had Bobby pins!"}
{"text":"The Groupon deal is such a rip-off. You only get basic well stuff and beers like PBR--that's it. They gave me shit about asking for a margarita (it's just tequila and sour mix). The food was over-priced and gross. I've had better food at legit dives. They were weird because I was drinking but my friend wasn't so they said we couldn't sit at the bar.   They also short-changed me when I gave them cash.   Avoid like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed the Rockhouse! I've been coming here since it was the front bar for the Imperial Palace. I followed it to the Miracle Mile PBR bar and then here. It could've folded here but I think that they found a vibe that works.  Pros- $50 all you can drink is worth it. Start here at 11, drink a bunch, go away and nap and come back later in the evening.  Their drink specials are good, and the specialty cocktails tasty.  Food aint bad either.  Waitresses and bartenders are mostly friendly.  Men's room has an icon of a rooster on it, I don't wanna know what is on the ladies...  Cons- The ridiculous pool table.  Nothing else around here is like this. None of the shops, restaurants, or attractions are remotely low-class.   Beer pong tables cross the dart boards -- how does that work?  Overall a good waste of an hour or so and a great place to hang while the ladies shop/gamble. (Is there a financial difference between the two?)"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend of a friend's show on a Saturday night. The place was definitely lit and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I got a couple of whiskey gingers (which do pack a punch at the size they give them) and one of the blue shots the girls sell at the tables. Everything was awesome and it's a really fun place to listen to some music, dance, or just chill with friends. I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Crappy service. P. was our hostess. As soon as she took our order she came back with our drinks and the tab and asked to settle up because she was being moved to the other side? This is before we received our food. And once it came no one checked on us again accept the guy who came by and stole our empty plates without a second glance. Oh, and the food was mediocre at best and way overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for the Super Bowl and what a great place to watch the game!!! There were TVs everywhere - service was amazing and the after party was great. Awesome atmosphere! Would recommend for any major sporting event."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. Our server Heather kept the food and drinks flowing and the games were great. Would visit again."}
{"text":"After Yelping for an upcoming Vegas trip I came across this bar and it seemed like everything I am about and everything I love back home. I was right. This place did not let me down.. it did take some finding as it is inside the Venetian Hotel. This place is divey but not intimidating. The bartenders were all awesome and there was a nice mixed crowd both times I came. Drinks  and shots are a bit pricey but it's Vegas after all and the atmosphere made the price worth it. The food seemed like standard bar food but that can be just what you need after a few drinks. The drinks were delicious and strong what more could you ask for? Best of all? A $50 option to drink all day, come and go as you please!"}
{"text":"Got the Groupon for the open bar deal. Felt like we were a bother to the bartender. She kept ignoring us. The place was dead. Drinks horrible. DONT DO IT"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. If you could rate 0, I would. This place had the worst service I've ever experienced. $40 all you can drink....in 45 minutes I received ZERO drinks....even though I ordered twice. Watching a game? They might change your TV mid game and then dilly dally to change it back....but still don't. Three hours, a full game, and only 3 beers were delivered. They may seem accommodating on the phone, but don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"Wings were fantastic! However, Sydney at the bar could definitely use an attitude adjustment. She was so unfriendly an inattentive. I won't be back if she's walking. Gregory and Sarah were very nice and had great customer service.  Try the boneless mild wings!"}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night for ladies night to get a few cheap drinks before we headed to a club. The place was completely empty, so that kind of sucked. We expected the ladies night drinks to be $1 Pinnacle vodka cocktails, but I guess they've upped their prices to $2. Either way, it was still a good deal. We drank a few and then headed out for the club. Overall, I would have rather just had a few more drinks in our room before going out the club and skipped this altogether."}
{"text":"\"The Only Las Vegas Ultra-Dive Bar\" might make you dive out the window into the Venetian lagoon below. First of all, f* you for calling anything an 'Ultra-dive' bar. You contain none of the features found in a good dive bar or an ultra lounge. You are a sports bar, Rockhouse. Own it (or take down your 80+ tv's playing sports).   Unfortunately, they fail at the sports bar elements too. Drink prices at $8/shot and $12/cocktail? Huh. Why are you here? I can get a (better) $12 cocktail at a reputable joint somewhere else in the Venetian. Isn't this a $5 pint of Jack 'n coke type of place? WTF? The food was a fail for me as well. The grilled chicken and avocado sliders should be renamed \"wood chip served between a sawdust bun\" as they were dry, tiny and tasteless. Sure, you can come here with good company (as I did) and have fun, but that can be done anywhere in the area.   Oh yea, they have a mechanical bull. Ride it. NEXT!"}
{"text":"I've stopped at the Rock House to grab a quick drink (in the front by the casino hallway) and had nothing but good service.  Friendly waitresses and bartenders.  HOWEVER, once we ventured inside to eat, it was a disaster.  The service was terrible throughout the meal.  Our waitress just disappeared.  After finishing our food and waiting 20 minutes I went to hunt her down so we could pay and get back to normal Vegas activities.  Waited another 20 minutes and still no check!  We literally had to hunt her down again and threaten to walk out on the bill before we got our check.  Never again.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I would have given this place a 1 star.... shoot, probably less than that.  Apparently during half times of games and various breaks in the sporting world, extremely obnoxious, attention seeking girls (not women because most of them look VERY young) get on a mechanical bull, touch each other and themselves provocatively and blow a whistle over and over again.    Now on to the positives... This bar isn't expensive ($25 for a bucket of 5 beers) and the wings (bone in) are quite good.  There are a good amount of TV's and you can pretty much pick which room you want to be in.  They have bar games like shuffleboard and flippy cup that looked like fun.  Whether you're freaking out about your Fantasy Football Team or just an NFL fan who enjoys watching the games, this is a good fit for you.  If they could eliminate the obnoxiousness of the females who work there, it would cater to more people that want to actually watch games and enjoy bar food without the stupid whistles piercing their ear drums."}
{"text":"was a little apprehensive about coming here because I didn't want to go somewhere wild for dinner but we got there early enough, it wasn't bad at all.   Food was AMAZING, best hot dogs I've ever had, they were mini too and you could chose from numerous toppings.   The staff was very helpful and friendly as well.   We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My boy and I came to Vegas as a going away party and we end up getting a party pass for a couple days. The first night we were there The Rockhouse was one of the spots, AWESOME!! Cheap drinks, great staff, in the back you could play flip cup or beer pong,music was good. Everything about that place was awesome. On Saturday we went early for a day party tour and I bought the $25 all you can drink...it last all day. I later went that night and was still able to drink for free. I have no bad things to say about that place."}
{"text":"Si no es el bar con más vida en el Strip, le pega en el palo. Ubicado en el Venetian, lo encontré por primera vez cuando pasaba cerca de la puerta del hotel y escuchamos una versión en vivo de Sweet Child O' Mine a todo volumen. Subimos rápido y se podía ver desde los pasillos abiertos del Venetian a un tipo grande pegando gritos que recordaban a Axl en sus años dorados. Una vez adentro, vimos que era noche de karaoke (todos los Jueves), con una banda profesional que la rompía, y justo un regular que dejaba todo en la cancha. Cuando terminó, bajó del escenario y se subió a su carrito a dar vueltas por el bar (volvería para cantar Highway to Hell un rato mas tarde).  El público se prendía mucho, festejando a todos los valientes que cantaban, buenos y malos. Parece un lugar ideal para cumpleaños y cosas así. No se como será otros días.  En cuanto a bebida y comida, lo normal. Cerveza tirada un poco más barata que en otros bares de la zona, y algunos tragos ricos pero nada excepcional. Volvimos otra noche a picar algo y cometimos el error de pedir chicken wings. Terriblemente picantes. Pero fue nuestra culpa, bajamos la guardia."}
{"text":"Best Tacos and Tiny Hot Dogs! New location is amazing. My roommates and I love going there for food and drinks. That atmosphere is always amazing amung locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks and few games of pool. Really cool bar and they had a special for $50 all you can drink wristband  (holy shit)  Mechanical bull riding was hilarious to watch, pole dancers, play cool music, giant sized connect 4, lots of beer pong tables, giant jenga, giant beer towers and a awesome view located in the Venetian.   Cool pit stop for drinks before hitting the strip. Wish the wristbands worked all throughout the casino. Be sure to check in for a buy one get one drink here!"}
{"text":"Good layout, friendly staff, and excellent waffle fries. The place didn't get jumping until almost midnight. The ratio of men to women was terrible, about 75/25 percent so if you're a single guy, be aware. Maybe I came on a bad night."}
{"text":"Elizabeth with the Batman tattoo is  such a great bartender! I didn't want to leave! She is the best! If you want a great beer and awesome conversation come see her!"}
{"text":"Great drink specials and the best service I have ever had in Las Vegas. Genevieve was awesome. Apparently there's a mechanical bull in the back, but I didn't make it that far. Mike liked the fuzzy dice."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a mess but it is for sure a 3 and a half star place. What I mean by a \"mess\" is that I feel like they have no direction in who they are trying to get in here. It was kind of cool that it felt like anyone was welcome but I don't know who they are targeting.  There is a mechanical bull for the cowboys/cowgirls, stripper poles for the ladies, beer pong for the frat boys, punk rock serves, and hip-hop music. There was just a lot of different things going on, but that did make it a little more fun as I just sat back and watched the show.  The drinks were a little less expensive then the average bar/night club, and they do offer some good deals. There are also a tone of TV's and of course each one is playing something different.  This is a coin toss...go there or don't but if you do, they will have something you enjoy and something you wont."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a dive, but it's supposed to be, right? It's supposed to emulate a roadhouse bar and they definitely get the decor and atmosphere right. There's even a mechanical bull to match. The only problem is that the beer choices are also out of a roadhouse bar so don't expect much beyond \"lite\" beer. While there the two interesting crafty sounding ones on tap were both kicked, further limiting the options. Service is friendly when you can get their attention, which even when not busy, isn't easy. It's a good spot to hang out to watch a game with a fairly low key and somewhat peaceful atmosphere, and the music here is excellent."}
{"text":"This place was awesome for our New Year's Eve day bowl games!  We took advantage of their special offer which was $100 per person guaranteed you a seat and all the premium drinks you wanted!  The manager was so wonderful as was our very  accommodating and friendly waitress/bartender Liz.  We hardly drank!  But we could if we had wanted to!  The other people that came to watch the games were very nice too, even if they were for the other teams. The food was really good, too.  All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here for Super Bowl Sunday. The food and drinks were totally worth the money and the service was amazing. One of the bartenders, Carissa I believe is her name was extremely attentive and made sure to take care of me the whole night as well as the other bartender that served me, Jill. I highly recommend you have a seat by wherever they are stationed to make sure you have a great time."}
{"text":"It's got a lot of TVs, so if you're looking for sports watching in Vegas it's an option.  Unless of course the Rodeo is on! That's right folks, we were here on a College Saturday, in the last week of season.  Conference Championship games were being played across the country and 85% of the TVs were tuned to... wait for it.... Rodeo.  What the ??!?!    After we asked they were so kind to give us 1 of their 80 TVs to the game we wanted. I have nothing against the Rodeo, but really?!   Food wise, it's a 1 star.   Average bar food.  Probably edible if your drunk, which is quite encouraged there with their $100 or $50 \"Drink All You Want... All Day\" options depending on the time you get there.    Oh and strangely we ate breakfast here too. How, why? Don't ask....but let me just offer this advice, don't order the hot dogs for breakfast. You'll regret it. I know, it seems obvious.  There are better options in Vegas for almost everything you'd get out of the Rockhouse."}
{"text":"This bar is the worst one I've ever been to. There was 2 bartenders trying to serve about 20 people which made the service terrible. One of the female bartenders was rude when I asked for green beer on st paddys day, she walked away after I asked the second time for the green beer. THEY DIDNT HAVE GREEN BEER ON ST PADDYS DAY after they had huge posters promoting it. I asked for Red Bull and vodka and they said they didn't carry REDBULL! Wtf! I don't recommend this bar. I'm never coming back myself."}
{"text":"Do not fall for the $1.50 tacos. Worst tacos ever! Took half an hour to get them when the place was practically empty. What we were served was unedible. My friend actually asked if the shrimps were sea monkeys, and the guac was the consistency of baby food. Most of them contained just tomatoes and bright orange, possibly fake, cheese. Band was awesome, but those tacos still give me nightmares."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Rockhouse thanks to a \" buy any one drink at full price and get the second free\"...advertisement.  my friend and I were impressed with the decorations. When we got our drinks we realized the drinks didn't have much liquor. The drinks are not the best. The steak tacos were salty!!! The buffalo wings were okay. The waitress was a bit distracted and wasn't paying attention to the customer.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in not knowing what to expect.  We did look up on line to check out the menu and to find out what quick bites we can find before our Rock of Ages concert. We found out they have Taco Tuesdays, 1/2 off drinks and appetizers.  When we arrived we walked in and were greeted by 2 employees with smiles on their face.  The waitress came over and we ordered drinks.  Very friendly,  I ordered 3 tacos: shrimp, fish and chorizo. The chorizo taco was my favorite! Tacos are $1.50 or $2.00 each.  My husband ordered the chicken chiptole tacos and my husband really enjoyed them.  We had 7 tacos and 2 drinks.  Around $20- $25.  We were really happy with our food and drink choices.  The staff was very friendly and came to our table often to check on us.  Great job and kudos to your food and staff.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place had some of the worst service I've ever received. Waited an hour for two tacos which I never received and yet were still on my bill. The bartender was miserable and disappeared for most of the time. Way to many other places in Vegas to go to than spending time here."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here!!!  My friends and I enjoyed NYE here  Fun Fun fun!!! can't wait to come back again soon good music"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is enjoyable, plenty of TV's to watch all of the football games.  However, the food is not good. The fries are over cooked in what tastes like old oil. The bread on the burger is hard, the chicken wings are dry and taste old."}
{"text":"Hey, wished that I could've stayed longer but I had to baby sit my friends. But at the same time it was a great time. Held in my alcohol, kept things under control. Raymond the security man said I was responsible at keeping things at a minimal. But all in all, good vibe, good drinks, good music this night. Wished I could've gotten exotic drinks instead of domestic. Good place. - Tony."}
{"text":"Went to the Rock house bar last Thursday, April 20th. What brought us in was Karaoke. The doorman was friendly but none of the two female bartenders ever greeted us. There weren't as many people/customers since it was earlier in the night yet we were ignored for over 20 minutes. A friend of mine and I were standing at the middle of the bar and tried to get the bartenders attention but did not have much luck. We walked out disappointed. From there, we went to Tao and had a great night.   We stayed 5 nights in Vegas and this is the only place that disappointed us. You have a great location and the music sound fun too but the service has to be improved."}
{"text":"This place is like d-bag central. It's awful. Drinks aren't great. The band was terrible. Service was slow. We only went because someone handed us passes for two-for-one drinks. Woof."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this to anyone!! The food is not terrible, but the service is beyond bad! We came here from a convention held in town because of their special, a burger, fries, drink for only $10. We got here and our hostess told us about the special, waited ten minutes for our drink order to come back (just soda, no alcohol) when our server came to take our order she had no idea what we were talking about and the manager \"let us\" have the special but inky for that day, even though there was clear advertisement about the special by their front doors!!! Our drinks were empty the entire meal, food was probably the best part because it was cheap, there was 6 of us and they would only split the bill two ways, it was too complicated to split the bill more than that they said. Oh and to top it off, not like it was busy, it was 3:15 and they had 5 tables in the restaurant including us."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 min and didn't even take our order. Said she would be back but never showed back up so we got up and left. Can't tell you if food and drink was good or not."}
{"text":"It was lit bro ! Bartenders were great the music was fun . They have pool tables and just over all a great experience . Going back in the day time to watch the pLAy offs . Go rams"}
{"text":"Okay so I go here all the time and the food is surprisingly amazing exp the chicken tacos!!!! Out of this world. The drinks are really expensive but prob bc it's on the strip. The place is awesome though the decor and location is great. If you want a laid back bar on the strip this is the spot!"}
{"text":"They tried to charge us a cover of $5/pp but we could tell the place was dead and wanted to just play some beer pong so we didn't think it was worth it.  They let us in anyway.  We played some beer pong which was a nice set up, and watched the idiots fall of the mechanical bull (they still have those?).  All and all, a descent spot to stop off and play some beer pong, listen to music, and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite before seeing mystere at treasure island.  We found ourselves here after wandering around the area.  They were a bit understaffed considering it was a holiday (or so they said) even though it was not really crowded.  We had to move sections after the person at the front bar said they could not serve food.  The waitress at the back bar was nice though.  Rockhouse is probably a better place to meet up with friends,  grab a drink and grab some food once you have had a few rather than a place to plan dinner.  The food was just okay.  We had pulled pork sliders and the chicken nachos.  The sliders were not bad and the nachos were like the nachos you get at a ballpark.  Neither were much to write home about."}
{"text":"Went here just for something convenient and ended up being one of the best meals I had in Vegas.  Friend chicken sandwich- best ever.  Great flavor, very generous portion, fresh, and hot.  Great value and service from the bartender.  Will definitely be our go to next time for a good and quick meal."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for Super Bowl and reserved the place before we came out there from the bay area and one of my friends flew 16hours over seas and was treated horriably! We reserved it weeks prior and chose The RockHouse because of the great reviews it got from other friends of ours!Never in my life have I seen so much unprofessionalism from an establishment.We were seated in the worst location po We asked to see the contract and a seating chart and we got yelled at and got kicked out, by far the worst service I have seen in years!! I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy!!"}
{"text":"So let's start with if your on the strip and want something fairly priced with some top 40 music than this will be a place you can enjoy. If your expectations are higher than that you should keep going because this will not meet your expectations   Now onto the ambience and food- the decor is interesting with a car pool table and lots of tv's and 2 separate large rooms kind of a modern laid back type of vibe is what you will get. I think this is definitely more of a day time spot when you need a bite to eat that's reasonable or a drink recharge so you can keep pushing on down the strip . The food is above average and the portion sizes are decent with most items, the best part of the food is the price and the fact that they have happy hour and they do taco tuesdays.   If I was in the area I would come back again especially since the people serving me were nice"}
{"text":"A decent bar that deserves better than the ratings show. They have decent specials. Taco Tuesday is on point with $1.50 tacos. They also have their buy one get one drink special when using this app. They have a ton of games to play if you're interested. Everything from beer pong to a mechanical bull. Not the most scene or known about location, but worth checking out."}
{"text":"We decided to pregame here for the Devils/Knights game.  $1 PBR cans sounded good, before we took a pounding at the stadium bar.  We were quickly seated, no many people were there, it was 4pm , but the special was 4-7.  Figured a few more people would show up.  The place looked pretty cool, industrial.  They were playing good music and had the sports channels on.  We ordered our beers and were able to hang out and chill for a while.  It was a good spot to do it.  They had this pretty cool looking pool table, but don't get too close, the felt looks like someone threw up all over it.  Other than that it was clean and the service was spot on."}
{"text":"Liz is a fantastic bartender/server! Friendly and helpful!  If you go earlier in the day, you will feel like you own the bar! Get the all day drinking pass and you can come and go! This is located inside the Venetian complex"}
{"text":"After searching for a place to eat, found this place to eat. Food over priced for thr amount you get and its nothing impressive. The service was slow. Looong waiting time i would def  not recommend if your looking to eat a real meal."}
{"text":"On behalf of myself (DJ Dynamixx) and Babae I would like to thank the awesome staff and family we made while performing at The Rockhouse the past several months on Saturday nights. It was a lot of fun and the Rockhouse still has the best onion rings EVER!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on the special taco Tuesday night.to have a few drinks listen to the band and enjoy some tacos and appetizers.  It was our daughters 21st birthday. Party of 9.  Our simple taco and appetizers took over 1 hr and half. And that way only half our table the half got there food 20 minutes after that and was cold. Our waitress was doing the best she could check on our order but to me it looked like the kitchen was in disarray. I would not recommend this place to eat at. But the music and vibe. Was great just don't go on taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great place ... fantastic bar tenders and service. One that stands out for me is Genavive she is the best come see her at the rockhouse .."}
{"text":"This place was alright. We were looking for cheap eats in row of expensive restaurants.   Food - We all got the make-your-own tacos. They were good. My only complaint is that no side dishes come with it. You only get 3 tacos, that is all.  Service - Our waitress was super friendly. It did take 20 min to get water but it wasn't that big of a deal.   They have cool items littered throughout the place. Things like a tricycle, a cage, a stripper pole. They also offer all-day, all-you-can-drink for $50. I'm pretty sure the items are for drunk fools to play with. I love it. Oh yeah they also have a mechanical chicken. Not bull chicken."}
{"text":"Really loved the vibe and the customer service was good until my food was delivered. What was really not cool was when I had to get up grab my purse (because I was alone) to get up and flag waitr"}
{"text":"May have had potential, great location and decent burger. The bartender Marisa unfortunately wasn't very helpful with the menu suggestions, and didn't actually seem like she wanted to be there; We've all had bad days, I guess. I found the place thanks to the cityzen app that used my location and offered me a free drink. Mind you the app had no restrictions or stipulations which required a manager override. The free beer and or shot had a value of up to $10 yet my $9 IPA was an issue. Miss Manager, don't argue with a paying customer or make them feel like they're bothering you. Credit the check and take it up with your marketing department as there were no specifics on the app."}
{"text":"I'd recommend giving The Rockhouse a try.  The food was pretty good and they had vegetarian options.  The staff was unsure of the actual beer specials however and this is what the manager on the street had lured us in with.  That was quite disappointing, expecting a reasonable $3 beer and then it actually being $6 can deter my patronage for sure!  We were in during a slow lunch hour and the food was quite slow to arrive and waitress was not very attentive.  There are for sure plenty of options on the strip, but I'd give them another shot when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Groupon goodness gave me open bar. Drinking one's face off in Vegas at least once is recommended by 10/10 doctors.  Justin was awesome. Pouring for a full bar and worshipping me isn't easy, especially when busy. Unfortunately, the woman at the other bar near the entrance was very slow and took more than 5 minutes AFTER finishing a drink to make it back around to ask if I wanted another. This was the case for each drink I had. Suppose I shouldn't have tipped her in advance for them.   The food was pretty good, there are a ton of games such as beer pong, pool, shuffleboard etc, and the music and atmosphere are decent."}
{"text":"This is my number one must go to place in Vegas. It's this odd mix of a dive bar but in a way only Vegas can do it. It's nice, but it's casual. You still feel like you are in Vegas but just at ease.   I spoke with Jennifer Olsen who was very helpful for my large party. Our sever, Quinn was an absolute delight and we all talked about her the next day. She helped make rockhouse the most memorable part of our time in Vegas. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ever since they fired the entire server/bartender staff last summer as a cover for the questionable accounting practices of mgmt, this place has STRUGGLED to find its footing.  They've tried to \"reinvent\" themselves by redoing the decor and seating, but they've gone through numerous new employees while scaling down and building back up their food menu, and still, after three return visits, their lunch service is near incompetent.  From the new interim menu months back being all a la carte and charging $8 for a small cup of fries, to the second visit where the server didn't know the revised new menu and they served what was supposed to be a Big Mac clone but was only a single burger with thousand island dressing with a $4 upcharge and completely messing up the bill between three of us, to this latest visit where there was no one there when we arrived, but started filling up with CES people shortly thereafter and the server disappeared often, still couldn't bring us sides of ketchup, mustard, and ranch after asking three times, waiting 20 min for a drink refill, waiting 20 min for our bill and then waiting another 30 min for her to come get it, it was unbelievable.  They obviously were slammed by CES people but that's no excuse, it's Vegas, it happens often.  At times every employee there was running around not doing anything like they were trying to look busy but were just overwhelmed and secretly didn't know what to do. A guy who could have been the mgr was bringing out drinks to some tables but not checking to see if others needed anything, and it was obvious just from looking that there were several tables that did.  It was impossible to make eye contact with another server or hostess to get someone to take our bill because it seemed that no one there was paying any attention, except for the server who spent the entire time we were there talking to a couple of guys at an adjacent table and ignoring all her other tables. We rarely go here now, and this is the reason why.  The only reason we went there today was because we knew they wouldn't be as busy as every other restaurant on property.   Oh, as for the food?  It wasn't too bad. Worth going back for and dealing with all the other crap?  Not unless it's the last resort option.  And then maybe."}
{"text":"Liz is the best bartender, so personable and friendly. We love her!!!    Also download the Cityzen app for a free drink!  They also might hand out 2 for 1 drink discount card at the door.   Really nice place. Ask for Liz!!!"}
{"text":"Candy's the best bartender, she's so sweet and considerate. She's what brings me and my friends back every time."}
{"text":"As I was walking to the Venetian there was a guy standing by the escalator that was saying \"buy one get one free\". I approached him and he gave me 2 drink tickets. I thought what the heck let's see what beers they have on a tap. We went inside and yes they do have your regular Bud light/Budweiser crap but they do have Goose Island IPA, Strongbow, Dirty Dog IPA, so i thought wonderful. You buy one drink and they give you a second one on the house. Great idea and cool place. We ended up with Nile as our bartender and he was great.  You can also smoke cigars in the back bar if you want. We ended up here both nights and again Nile was our bartender. As soon as we walked up to the bar he greeted us, and immediately poured us Goose Island again. Nile changed the tv right away to a hockey game for us without no problem. This is a surprising find for the Venetian, cool spot, great beers, and a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to eat the food yet but I came on a night where there was a frat-party...I was a little skeptical about the age of the kids allowed in, during the frat party they did allow people who were underage in, and those who were of age wore wristbands...however that really didn't seem to stop kids from drinking; remove that and it was a fun atmosphere. They have beer pong, and the drinks are good. The design is really fun and alternative and my husband and I enjoyed watching the music videos, dancing around and having a few drinks."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place. The bartender was the best I've experienced all weekend. She really made us feel welcome and the drinks were perfect. I recommend this bar in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place is nice, it's at the Venetian but I happened to park at Palazzo and walked about 5 mins to get there from the outside.  I can easily see Yelp host an event here.  There are two major rooms, each with their own bar.  In the smaller room you have your bar but then you have party areas like beer pong tables, pool tables.    In the other room you had a whole DJ set up with elevated platform, tons of tables and seats.  There was also a lounge area, private area if you will also and more beer pong tables.  Now if you come here solo or just with one other person thinking it's like a Blue Martini then don't think that way.  I was here with a bunch of friends so we had a great time but doing the solo Vegas strip thing over here, I'm not sure.  Might as well just hop over next door to Tao and do it there.  There's a huge bird cage in the middle of the room for photo ops!"}
{"text":"Service excellent if you get all day drinking package. Elizabeth is awesome. Wings have good flavor bur heat does run a but less than what I would get in Texas so be prepared."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find the rock house (formerly in front of imperial palace) had reopened in the Venetian.   I had great times here off the strip on former vacations, having visited multiple times, and was excited to are their newer location with updated seating and new tvs. The service was good (wait for it) and on a bachelor party with 5 guys we opted for the $50 per person open bar sold to is by our waitress. She was good about making clear what drinks were included and the ease of the whole situation made it appealing.  When our server changed about 1.5 hours in, we tipped her about $70 on our $250 tab anticipating a night of drinking.  As our new server came, we were informed we could no longer be served at our table (because she didn't sell them to us). We could go to the bar or and she's sorry but it isn't her policy, \"you can talk to my manager\".  Mind you this was at 630 with the bar generally empty.  We dealt with it and went to the bar only to learn we had been downgraded from the traditional pint, to a literal 12 oz solo cup filled with about 8 ozs of beer. See photo.  In addition, when we tried to order blue moon, which we had been drinking for the previous 1.5.hours, we were told that it is no longer included in the open bar bracelet.  Overall, it seems a lot like a con. And it's unfortunate that this put a damper on our trip and really made us unlikely to ever return to a bar I had previously thought highly of.  I sincerely recommend going somewhere else. It's a big city with great options. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  Wish I could end the review there, for it is all that needs to be said.  Went on Sept 20, and had a terrible experience, with a manager that has no understanding of the hospitality business.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  (I write like 2% of my reviews that are this bad....kind or like there are only 2% of places to visit that are this bad)"}
{"text":"Cool space, relatively friendly staff, Taco Tuesday represents a chance to get out of here for $10.  But like most places in Vegas, $6 for a Bud Light feels strange and un-American, so come in knowing that you are gonna drop cash on drinks and you'll be fine.  Tried a fish taco, a chorizo, the chipotle chicken and the steak/blue cheese taco.  Chirizo and chipotle were better than the other two, but nothing was a home run here.  I'm not sure I would go back unless it's Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I had a good time. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this self professed dive bar, but I had a really good time. The staff was good and super friendly, mostly.   The $50 all you can drink wristband was what drew us in. It is valid all day and you don't have to sit there, you can come and go as you please. I didn't want to have to wear high heels and dress, though I did wear a skirt. There is no real dress code or 1000 people line up to get in. All of this appeals to me. I just want to have fun now and not wait in line for hours. The only downside I saw to the $50 wristband is that you can't get doubles, has to be mixed, and they don't really seem to be in a rush to serve you. There were a couple bartenders that were great. A couple that completely ignored me. That almost killed the night!  The pool table was a little lopsided, maybe even lumpy. I am not that bad at pool, but I did have a few drinks in me. The mechanical bull was fun to watch, couldn't quite drink up enough courage to give it a shot.   They usually have to move tables to get a dance floor going, but there wasn't a lot of people when we were there so they didn't bother. There was a menu as well, but I didn't partake. From the looks of the food coming out, it was on par with any standard pub. I really liked the location, the type of venue, and just the general atmosphere. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staff was rude and manager was a jerk !  Watching the Knights game at the bar, without warnings manager shut down yeh TV's and when bartender asked what happened, \"we are closed\"  !  Wouldn't recommend the place !"}
{"text":"Great location in the Venetian and they seem to have alot of Happy Hour specials including an all you can drink with coupon $30. I would probably have given a 3.5 if possible. The burgers were really good, fries excellent as far as fries go. The Carne Asado tacos were ok and just an fyi dont go with any sides just 3 tacos. My biggest issue was they were out of a few tap and I ordered a Stella which IMO was warm. I ordered an IPA next which was cold. The staff is very accommodating and fun. Maybe I'll return just to hang at the bar and take advantage of drink specials. Also FYI after 9 they have a DJ which was cool."}
{"text":"We've been having a staff party here for a couple of years now, and it's always fun. The mechanical bull was replaced with a mechanical chicken, so you know I rode that. The space is nice, with areas for chicken rider watching, fresh air, canoodling, and playing.  Take your pick - big Jenga, shuffleboard, pool, beer pong. . . . plenty to keep you entertained.  Dancing too, of course dancing. Staff is always really friendly, but they need to figure out their layout for buffets a little bit better.  A good spot to catch up with friends and have fun."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, drinks were super diluted, waiters were no where to be seen, some walked right by us but were not even concerned if there was a 0 on ratings they truly deserve it"}
{"text":"My review is for DI Wickey who has an amazing talent of blending old school, disco, pop, rock and more. Such an amazing blend.  My boyfriend and I came in on one of the drink specials and stayed longer just to hear the music.  And on a side note, the bartender made delicious drinks and the staff was great as well.  Wish I had a bar like this back home."}
{"text":"Elizabeth and Mustache kick ass. Make sure you ask for them!  Good tunes great drinks. 35$ open bar with the Cityzen App"}
{"text":"This place is as authentically a 'dive bar' as the Disney castle is authentically a castle. That said, I somehow don't hate it. Stepping out of the Venetian's marble extravagance into dark and carefully arranged grunge was kind of hilarious. Decent service, passable food, beer was cold. Gave it an extra star for the awesome retro rock music blaring over the speakers."}
{"text":"We got lured in by a promoter who said tacos on Tuesday were $1.50 each. However, don't be fooled, they are the size of your pinky! And they weren't even half stuffed with taco food. Though the menu made them sound gourmet and special,  they really just tasted same - meat and salty sauce on tortilla. Did I mention it took them 1/2 hour to make 7 pinky sized tacos? Divey, but not a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, friendly cute girls outside, cool bartender,  no cover early in the night. Plus the bartender actually knew how to make a proper amaretto sour. Delish! Coolfor more laid back people who want to dance without getting squashed and shuffled through lines. Its not as flashy as some bars, but who cares?"}
{"text":"Gross food. Bad service. Come here to watch football, but make sure you eat and drink before you get here.  Two stars just because we got a table with a nice view.  With so many other better options, I'm not sure how this place is still open."}
{"text":"Pricey, but Monday night karaoke was legit! Bartender screwed up my order and gave me two car bombs instead of jager bombs, still had to pay even tho it wasn't my mistake. Might be back"}
{"text":"'Free' drink tickets they give you out the front never work, and drinks are very overpriced. $29 for 3 beers, how are 3 even $29? $9.66 each I don't think so"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Rockhouse last night to watch the game we bought and open bar ticket for 30 bucks our waitress name Whitney told us it would be cheaper drinks and food if we didn't use that ticket we bought. She needs to go back to school for math our bill was over 300 hundred dollars. If we used that open bar ticket our bill would have been around 100 bucks. If you have to lie to your customers to make your money you shouldn't be a waitress and all that extra money we spent we had the most shit service plus she got our orders wrong and she couldn't even get our drinks right. I'm sorry but because if this dishonesty and bad service my friends and I will not be coming back and the people who read this should know how this place is being ran. I have to give 2 stars for the food and drinks that was excellent. It's too bad they could have got a five stars from me if it wasn't for the dishonesty, lousy service and poor customer service."}
{"text":"The staff at the Rockhouse are amazing. We ordered a guitar drink and two salads. While holding the guitar it had a hole and leaked all over my jeans. The manager came over and apologized and offered us more drinks, we knew it was not their fault so we declined and they offered to take care of something else for us. They put the drink in two to go cups. Once we finished eating we asked for the check and they had already taken care of our entire meal! That is the perfect example of how you take care of customers and we will definitely be going back as we were amazingly impressed by their professionalism and hospitality."}
{"text":"Great place for Taco Tuesday's! Great drink specials and appetizer specials not to mention the taco's! And if you're looking to belt out a few tunes that got karaoke! If you haven't tried it yet get down here!"}
{"text":"Welcomed by friendly folks, they honored our coupon for BOGO drinks at 11 am, were totally cool with our kids- let them play foosball, and ride the bull. Grab the coupon in one of the free mags around your hotel. Totally fun atmosphere and will be back. It is BAR people ... not Circus Circus - however they were welcoming, friendly and fun for kids and adults that can behave themselves."}
{"text":"Walked in and got seated. The place was dead. Honestly not more than a dozen people in the main bar/ dining area. Waitress was nice. Brought us menus. Gave us a few minutes to decide. When she came back for our order she informed us they were closing for an unexpected private event and we could eat but we only had 20 minutes to order and eat and get out. Not my idea of service or hospitality. I said I thought we would order anyway but she informed we we would be rushed. Left without ordering and will never go back. Wish I could give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place, they had a live band playing, they played some good old school songs from the 2000's from my college years. And their chicken wings are awesome btw."}
{"text":"Dam this place rocks for real .. it's just great flavor and hit the spot . The fries were awesome It's a bar / restaurant and the server was awesome we definitely will be back .. Check them out in Vegas ..."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money. Seven of us girls on a trip celebrating a birthday this past weekend came across this lunch spot which wasn't overly busy. We sat down and it took sometime for our waitress to come by. When she did, she took our drink and food order immediately. Drinks took about 20 or so minutes to get (mind you, only 3 of us ordered alcohol, the rest soda or water) and says our food should be coming out momentarily. The next 30+ minutes, still no food and waitress no where to be found. Our food finally comes out and every burger (not just the bun...the beef patties as well), every order of fries/onion rings was cold and limp to the touch and the grilled chicken salad was cold, limp and soggy. The server who brought out our food was friendly and apologetic and was slightly irritated the waitress didn't even provide us with plates/utensils. Due to the long wait, hungry and worried what would happen if they returned their food decided to just eat it. Still no site of waitress, I went and found her and asked to cancel my order and told her about the outcome of our food. My order never got canceled, but reheated and re-served. She still never checked on us, but instead sent the manager who offered a very small discount on our food and a couple of fried Twinkies.   On a side note: I had ordered their most expensive signature \"Pig Mac\" for $15.50!!! that looked scrumptious and highlighted on their screens throughout the restaurant. It looked NOTHING like it. I picked around at it and it was bleak, flavorless and unappealing. Burger King's Whopper put this burger to shame.   Needless to say, the consensus was to leave 0 or a very small tip."}
{"text":"Ok...you are hungover right now. You are severly dehydrated and are staring at the amusement park waiting line at the Italian joint directly across. You need water and food, suddenly ...you feel the undying urge to stop.DON'T DO IT......PLEASE LISTEN!!!!....DO NOT WALK....RUN out of this place! Do not let yourself suffer from the mirage that hungover shopping will cause! Had I not trucked through the shops at the Venetian dehydrated...I never would have stopped here. I made a mistake that I would regret for the rest of my time in Vegas. I still regret it.   Imagine your college boyfriend's fraternity house and combine it with your father's basement.  It's like eating at the gas station and from a cat litter box at the same time. It tries so hard. So hard that they have  full staff dedicated to luring people in to eat. This is not a dive. A dive has as an old shuffle board table and a pool table form the 70's. This is a corporate attempt to replicate an actual dive and it has failed miserably.   You suddenly hear a good Smashing Pumkpin's song and Rockhouse redeems itself. Then....Def Leopard blares and you think, \"It's too late..my order is in\".   When you realize that the nachos that the worst waitress ever (ex spirit airlines stewardess) shoves down your throat are designed for a stomach pump in a Las Vegas hotel bathroom...it is too late. Your friends then kindly move them to the next table.... but as you lift your head from the trough of hell....the 18 flat screens surrounding you each picture these \"nachos\". \"Nachos\"? It is like comparing a Taco to Antifreeze. These \"nachos\" landed me in an infirmary. Ask the USO. My friend's and I actually gauge the nastiness of conditions on a scale of Rockhouse(worst) to Hoarders Season 3 episode 2 (lesser evil).    Moral of the story: Drink water people. Do not let Satan's mirage locker swallow you whole. This place actually represents the bowels of Satan in Haiti. It was absolutely, positively the worst culinary experience of my life."}
{"text":"Should have known to keep walking when so much of the staff is put outside the hotel to entice people to come in for lunch but we were hungry and it looked cool enough so we took the chance. I wouldn't return. The service was the bare minimum and the food (from the very limited menu) wasn't great. I had the fish tacos and the mahi was so over cooked and dry I ate half of one. Oddly the fries were undercooked. There are so many great places to go in Vegas and around the Venetian there is no reason to waste your dollars here. Gave two stars instead of one because of the music."}
{"text":"* This review is for the bar/drinks/service. Cannot comment on the food (although it looks good)  Ashley is the best! She is super nice, friendly, and knows how to make a mean drink. We went to look for her & did not see her at the main bar. We asked security for her by name and they were extremely helpful when we inquired about her whereabouts.  Drinks are well-made (thanks again, Ashley!) and the atmosphere is very casual. The overall feel is what the name sounds like, a Rock House! I would liken it to a house of blues atmosphere without the house of blues prices. There's 3 bars and a dance floor with plenty of seating.   5/5 on drinks, service, and hospitality."}
{"text":"They don't have water??? Only bottled for $3????, really?  Too many great choices for cold beer and cocktails to return here."}
{"text":"Jill made a slow night for me and the guys a bit more fun! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday review:  I came here because of the great $1.50-$3 taco specials, and the $7 margaritas.   The tacos are street taco size, which I expected...  Taco#1 I ordered one of the chicken tacos, and it was cold and swimming in chili oil. Why?!   Taco #2 was the swordfish taco that was so old, dry and cold that I thought it too was either chicken or some sort of off-colored jerky.  Taco #3 another chicken taco that was mediocre and cold.  Our sever was not that great either. She was forgetful and a little ditzy.  Oh, I had hoped the margarita would redeem the meal, but it was weak and watered down and just plain gross.  This atmosphere is for clubbing and dancing only. Please DON'T EAT HERE.  Go there drunk and dance your pants off, and then go eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"All I remember from The Rockhouse is we were walking the strip and the girls that worked there approached us and asked if we wanted the two for one drink special. We figured what do we have to loose, so we went in and sat down. The place was empty, and just didn't have a good vibe. We each had a vodka cranberry and the pours were not heavy at all, in fact all I tasted was cranberry. We kind of felt like we wasted our time."}
{"text":"Hung out here on a Saturday afternoon to watch college football. They had a special going on where you could spend $50 and it was all you can drink, so most of our group took advantage of that and definitely got their money's worth throughout the length of the game. I personally just had a couple of Bloody Marys, which were okay but not overly strong or as spicy as I would like them to be.  Most of us also ordered food and enjoyed the \"nachos\" with waffle fries instead of chips, the Flava Flav chicken wings, and the veggie sliders (seriously, I would go back to this place just for those veggie sliders).  What made me rank The Rockhouse three stars instead of four is that the service was insanely slow, although this wasn't the fault of our server - she was the only person there for the entire floor in the half of the restaurant where we were sitting. Clearly they need to staff this place better. Additionally, the chairs are insanely uncomfortable - your choice is a backless bar stool or a hard metal bar chair with a back that is at most six inches tall. Not idea if you want to sit for a while to watch a game."}
{"text":"Free drinks with the cityzen app. Pool, music, friendly staff.  Close to the center of the strip.  Fun tines."}
{"text":"Great specials and great service. Food was tasty. I did have an issue initially with my brisket and they brought me a new meal and comped it! Love the service thanks Jay!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Palazzo in Las Vegas, we walking around in between breakfast time and lunch time.  We were trying to hold out for the number one buffet in all of Vegas, but we desperately needed a snack.   A bartender was just outside The Rockhouse door promoting a special for $1.50 tacos.  Initially, we walked away, but then we walked back to look at a menu.  We ended up ordering several tacos and some criss cut fries.  In regards to the tacos, they were small but very tasty.  The mahi mahi were the best with the chicken coming in second.  The fries were amazing, and you should try them.  Our bartender, Eva, was awesome.  She shared several stories and provided a lot of information about the best pool clubs in Vegas.  Eva was an excellent representative for the business, and the food was worth the price.  I forgot to mention that the beer on tap was very cold and well-priced."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever. We had made a reservation and when we arrived we found out the entire place was reserved for a private event. We spoke w the manager and were completely dismissed. We had a very limited amount of time to meet with family that was in town before their dinner reservations so we really only wanted to sit for an hour and have a drink. I think we should have been allowed to stay and sit so we could talk, we weren't going to be bothering anyone."}
{"text":"If your all yuppie,  this is not your place.  But to get out with friends and not have to be pretentious this is a great spot on the strip. Real low key and feels like a back home bar. I went Tuesday night because I want to hear this band called \"Stoked\" Listen to me now.  If you are looking for somewhere on a Tuesday and you like rock music come to the rock house. Stoked was amazing.  I had heard a song on Facebook and being a lover of good ol fashion rock music I went to see them at the Rockhouse at the Venetian on a Tuesday night.  Honestly,  they were amazing.  The lead guitar and vocalist is an incredible musician, every song they play they have a jam session in there to make it unique and maybe better than the original. Bass and drums were really good. But... what makes their sound so unique is the violin played by Rahmaan . Absolutely incredible. He makes every song sound so beautiful.  He along with Ilan the lead  guitar compliment each other in a way I have never seen. The covers of sweet child of mine and hotel California were the best I have ever heard. Truly. Rahmaan can make any sound out of the violin, he makes it cry like you've never heard.  This band will make it one day. I assure you. Book these guys. You will not be disappointed.  What a great band!"}
{"text":"All girls ride the rooster (or insert a dirtier, funnier word for rooster here) for free at the Rockhouse!  We came here just to low-key celebrate a friend's 30th birthday and had a total blast.  So what if it's divey?  So what if there are a lot of bros hanging out here?  So what if the service isn't THAT amazing?  The drinks are pretty strong, they offer a pretty fantastic all-day discount if you buy a wristband up front (which birthday boy did, and he made that discount WORK), and there's plenty of games to play (pool, shuffleboard, darts, connect 4, you name it) to help alleviate the boredom and keep you out of the Las Vegas heat."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palazzo and heard about this place on Yelp. We wanted to try it out so we arrived early and got some free entrance passes. At 9pm we showed up and we're the first ones in the bar area (where they hold the comedy club) This place is huge!!  We sat at the bar and ordered a bunch of drinks and shots. The bartender Justin was awesome and very attentive. They do have an all you can drink special you can purchase for I believe $50.00.  We opted to pay as we go as we like mix drinks and shots. We ended up spending around the same. We drank Mules,margaritas and Slippery Nipple shots!  We are an older couple and enjoyed the age range here from 20's to 50+ having a great time! Thanks Justin for being a great bartender and we will be back in August with some friends!!"}
{"text":"Second time tried..  1. The name is misleading. They don't play rock- they play top 40 hip hop (like every other bar/club). 2. Weekend nights are somehow empty?? 3. Nuff said."}
{"text":"For anyone coming to Vegas; if you want to drink, the Rockhouse has a great bartender Kat and the chef of Andre is amazing. We came with a Groupon yesterday but they didn't have time for us because of private parties. We did some light complaining and the manager eased our sorrow with his awesomeness and we rescheduled things to come back the next day. This place is real awesome and the day pass means you can come at 11:30a and they close at midnight, come and go as you wish, smack dab in the middle of the strip."}
{"text":"CHEESEBURGER!!!! Was amazing! I ordered a burger and fries. And I MUST SAY!!!! It was probably one of the best burgers I have EVER HAD! Really! GREAT BURGER!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the Venetian hotel. It is located at the 2nd floor next to the Grand Canal Shoppes. I wouldn't say it's a nice place to relax after a hectic day of shopping because it does get crowded during games.  Honestly, the food is great but it's nothing special. It's not like buffalo wild wings or hooters. The only great thing about it is that you may customize your food however you please! I was disappointed about their buffalo wings because 75% was skin/breading 25% meat. You're better off making your own taco or hotdog than the wings. I liked their chicken chipotle slider with bacon. Omfg. Idk the spiciness is just right for me.  The pros outweigh the cons of this restaurant in my opinion... Pros: - The waitresses really take care of you and they're hospitable! - Have you seen the 88oz guitar drink container?! It's badass, get your mixed drink in there and walk around the strip feeling like a rockstar. - Entertainment; there are various games to play which include: table hockey, pool, foosball, and not to mention the mechanical bull ride. You can never have too much of a laugh when drunk chicks just try and dominate the thing.  Cons: - Kind of a small place so it get's pretty crowded - Be careful of where you sit because there are certain spots in the air conditioning vents where there's water droplets - The wings... Ehhh, I'll give it a C-"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink a couple months ago and had a good time, they had cheap decent drinks with lots of promotions, bartenders were friendly, good music and so on...little did I know I was making a horrible decision when I decided to return with some people for CES... BY FAR one of the WORST places we have ever (re)visited, dirty and unorganized, the staff seemed very different, extremely rude and it is very clear no one actually wants to work there. I felt like we witnessed more arguments and upsets then we did anyone drinking or having (dare I say) fun?... I'm in disbelief that this place is affiliated with the Venetian or that any company would allow a venue to run in such terrible conditions, with horrid customer service, dirty/gross bathroom facilities, and the overwhelming amount of low class that seemed to add to all the battles between staff and customers.... I recommend you stay far away from rockhouse, they will ruin any aspect of you day/night. They are literally sucking the soul out of Vegas."}
{"text":"The Rockhouse is located in the Venetian, right off Las Vegas Blvd. They offer a mechanical bull, beer pong tables, pool table, 2 full bars, and a decent menu for grub. The daily deal is buy 1 drink and get 1 free and they do hold their word to it which is great. The food is hit or miss, as the chips were stale but the philly cheese steak sliders weren't bad just a little salty. They offer a $50 open bar deal where it's all you can drink for only $50 but it doesn't include all the alcohol there, only a selected menu. The music is classic rock to modern day hits. The staff was hit or miss as some were great and others not too quick to serve you. Some of the staff, mainly a guy, had a real gutter mouth on him, it's not a bad thing for me but I did notice kids were present and ladies as well, plus it's not a real dive bar in a crappy part of town so tone it down there guy. The bar is divided into 2 sections, the main area with the mechanical bull and the smaller side bar with the pull table. I would definitely come back here but they can use better quality food and reevaluate their staff being the prime location they're in. Hopefully a future 4 to 5 star rating next time."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places in Vegas! A must stop by every time! They recently upgraded and moved to the venetian! I was a little sad to hear that at first because I loved their location! But they definitely made it worth it! I love the staff and now they have a mechanical bull! Definitely go by and enjoy your time there!"}
{"text":"The \"Rockhouse\" that doesn't play rock. Total buzz kill. Took forever to find the place and when we finally found the ROCK House they weren't playing Rock. Friday night and the place was boring. My guess is because of the non-ROCK music, rap crud they were playing. Non smokers beware as the there is plenty of smoking going on here."}
{"text":"We wandered by at the Venetian killing time prior to the Human Nature concert.  We wanted to nibble on something prior to the show at 7pm.   Saw it was HH between 3pm-6p, 1/2 specialty drinks and appetizers.  We moseyed up to the bar and ordered cocktails with chicken nachos appetizer.  It was just average. Two cocktails, one draft beer, one PB, and the nachos, $25 inc tax & tip.    The Rockhouse bar seemed out of place at the Venetian.  It has a separate entrance that faces the Strip.  Dark and gloomy setting."}
{"text":"Just a great sports bar. We saw someone attempt to take down a 4lbs burrito and fail. Good drinks, good atmosphere and better than average bar food. Not to mention as far as Vegas restaurants go the cost was very reasonable. Fast service as well."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here which turned into a couple hours. Our group did a little dancing, a little drinking and ended up on the bull. Tip for the guys, don't hit on the girl that controls the bull right before you get on. She will destroy your balls with that bull with a smile. All in all, we had a great time here."}
{"text":"As a local, the strip is a place you avoid. Recently, I starred attending Rockhouse. A friend told me about DJ Dynamixx and Babae. Wow! So cool! And SO MUCH FUN! Hard to believe, but that's now our spot! Good jams from back in the day that pick you up and make you feel good. When they are in the house, I get to relive fun moments of my life. Song after song turns into hour after hour. I go home exhausted, but the journey to the strip is SO worth it with Dynamixx and Babae in the house! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"First time going to rockhouse, amazing experience, great drinks, host, and bartender! ANNA was our bartender and I have to admit she was awesome! Great customer service and delicious drinks!  The environment there is also great! Good music!! Will definitely be going back when I visit vegas again!"}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed until two months ago. Stopped by here after dinner with two colleagues and played a game of beer pong, haha.  I'm not really sure who frequents this place. I would think locals and/or people who get really bored? Because while I can see how it may be a fun gathering spot and they are definitely not short on entertainment options, I don't imagine myself coming here when I'm in Vegas for leisure. Great alternative to dressing up for the clubs, though!"}
{"text":"They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday, I didn't realize all the football games were on so it was super crowded, but I was still able to get a seat at the bar. Staff was very friendly and attentive and the mahi tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"What's great about this place is that I don't know of any others like it on the strip. It's a fun restaurant/bar with the things you'd expect like food and drinks, plus other things you wouldn't expect like a leopard pool table, beer pong and a mechanical bull. With TV screens all around to watch sports, I could honestly see myself hanging out here for several hours (on the right night).  I came here with Drew A., Kevin L. and Shane N. The night we came was Halloween, so this was our pre-party spot not our final destination. They were however hosting a costume contest and had special Halloween inspired $5 drink specials. I tried the Irish-American Pie: Pinnacle Pumpkin Vodka, Hiram Walker Irish Pumpkin Spice and Half and Half, it was decent, but I could only handle one before I wanted something else.  Their menu is basically several versions of sliders, tacos and hot dogs but the cool thing is if you don't find a combo you like they also have a 'create your own' menu on the flip side. You choose the toppings and meat you want and you can truly create your own burger, hot dog or tacos. Shane and I tried the Philly Cheese Steak Sliders and they were delicious!  The staff was attentive and even were nice enough to take photos for us of us in our costumes. Before we headed on, Drew rode the mechanical Bull like a champ (yes there are pictures)! It's free for girls and $5 for guys.  If you're tired of the same old same old on the Vegas Strip, this place would be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Service absolutely terrible...waited 1/2hr for someone to even come to the table and take our order. When she did come over....\"What do you want to order\" were the first words out of her mouth....not very friendly waitress"}
{"text":"Beer pong tables, stripper poles, and a mechanical bulls. What else could you ask for? My party of 20+ people stumbled in here after NYE which was a great alternative to paying $60 per person at a club, and if you don't want to dress to the nines. The drinks were reasonably priced for Vegas, the place wasn't over crowded so plenty of room to dance, and they played some awesome hiphop music. None of the EDM junk. Good times to be had by all."}
{"text":"The new location is fantastic!!! It's not so convenient to the strip like before but the upgrade is seriously worth it. Come on, there's a mechanical rooster now!  The digs include three sections: the frozen drink bar, smokers area with games like beer pong, jenga and life size connect four, and lastly a smoke free bar area with tons of tables and tvs. They still have the old birdcage and arcade tables and of course, the guitar cup was out in force :) Cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We just went to Rockhouse for lunch. Such great service and prices! I tried the chicken avo sliders and my husband had the chipotle chicken sliders. We were both very satisfied! They were quick to check on us and fill our drinks"}
{"text":"Visited a few months back and wanted to see if it was the same cool bar that it was when it was down in front of IP.  I am happy to say that it is even better!  Loved the layout, Taco Tuesday is a definite taste treat and our girl Jenna is the best bartender!  Got great deals through the Cityzen app...what could be better than free drinks?  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place I had so much fun!!!   Really down to earth place, good music, good food, gun to to party especially on the weekends.  And our promoter Rashad really hooked us up"}
{"text":"They are not attentive and they have no clue how to run this place. People can easily walk on in their bill because they don't pay attention and have no clue what is going on. I waited for a table for 15 minutes and no server came. I had to fetch a manager who was wearing a NY Yankees hat, jeans and a blue sport coat. Did not have the appearance of  a manager. Had to clue what to do but to offer us a drink on the house. We were brought our order and our server never checked in on us. These people have no clue what they are doing."}
{"text":"One of the promoters offered a buy one get one deal (buy a 16oz daiquiri with a shot, get a shot free). It was hot as hell outside and we didn't feel like walking any further so we decided to stop in. It wasn't super busy, but took us a long time to be waited on. The bartender seemed nice, said she was going to pour a \"healthy\" shot. Who wouldn't want to hear that,  right? The shot she poured was a decent amount. I wanted a strawberry pina colada daiquiri. She only poured strawberry so she had to pour some of it out to put in the pina colada. She poured another shot of \"rum\" on top. I am somewhat of a lightweight and extremely sensitive to alcohol taste so I immediately think that I won't be able to drink this drink at all, because it'll be so strong. There was no liquor in those drinks at all. That \"house rum\" must've definitely been \"house water.\" Super disappointing as my first drink of the day. I would never recommend getting drinks from there, unless it was a fresh bottle or can of beer.  On a more positive note, the wings were good. We ordered Jamaican jerk and hot wings. The hot were 10x better in my opinion."}
{"text":"\"Dive bar\" is appropriate. Funky little joint situated at the end of a lengthy corridor. From inside the Venetian/Palazzo, if you don't know where you're going, you'll probably never find it. We were actually planning to go to the restaurant across the hall from this place, but it was not open so we went in here instead.  Initial impression was that it could be a really cool joint. It has a funky vibe to it that isn't quite \"bar\" and isn't quite \"restaurant\". We managed to snag a nice spot by the big opening window/wall area where we could overlook the Strip. Only problem, which became apparent very quickly, was that the waitress didn't seem to want to come over there and \"wait\" on us. After sitting there for a rather lengthy time she finally stopped by and said \"Oh, I didn't see you guys over here\" after walking right past us a half dozen times.  I came back a couple times after the first visit and found the service to be roughly the same. If you're in any sort of hurry, steer clear! The food was decent. It wasn't amazing, like so many other food options on the Strip. But it wasn't bad either. The Taco Tuesday menu was actually really nice and I sampled about half of that menu. Given the chance, I'd just order the tacos if I were you. they are actually really good.  The mechanical bull was entertaining to watch after the sun went down. With a funky mix of \"urban cowboys\", dudes looking to \"score\" and girls who fawn over beer pong this place can be rather entertaining at night. But the lack of quality service in a town known for customer service leads me to knock some stars off my rating. I shouldn't have to sit there for 10 minutes (each time I went there) before someone finally waits on me."}
{"text":"I'm here for a private event. To order food we had to go to the bar. I'm  sitting at the bar to order food. Credit card sitting in front of me. No drink. Bartender takes 4 orders for food at my left. Goes to my right and takes orders for drinks from 4 guys totaling 12 drinks. Then goes to my left and takes 2 drink orders. Finally asks if I want to order food, I say yes and she walks away and takes 2 more.drink orders. Food comes out and the runner gives my burger to someone else and takes my wife's wings back to the kitchen. 4 minutes later he tries to give us cold wings. I asked if those are the same wings he brought out earlier and returned to the kitchen and he said yes. I said I will not take cold wings. My bacon cheese burger comes out with cold cheese and the wings are now burnt because they but the old wings in the broiler or salamander. Clark County Health Department will here about this. All Corporate sponsors will be told to stay clear at future conferences. I've lived in this town and come back every year and have never had an experience this bad. @RockhouseVegas #rockhouseVegasSucks"}
{"text":"All I know is we stumbled across this after going the long way through the Venetian this past Friday. We were about to turn around before a waitress said come in we have $1 drinks for the ladies. I'm like ok.. even if the drinks are high, it will be like 2 for 1. We get in and the DJ was rocking!!! They also had $50 all day open bar for me!!! I'm like this is a win win. We danced the night away and our bartender was fantastic. I never went without a drink"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. With games like jenga, fuseball, DJ, great atmosphere with food specials. Went today and was highly disappointed. Not what it used to be."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as we are beer conisuors, were hungry, & Sin City Brewing does not serve34 food (see my review.)  We sat at one of their tables closest to the entrance.  I loved the music they had going; a perfect blend of rock music & pop.  Our waitresses were very friendly & attentive.  We ordered the beer poached chicken wings, onioon rings, & fries.  The wings are tender with buffelo, sweet chili, & bbq sauces; all ver5y good& upon request, they brought us out some additional sauces like a sweet chili.  It is definitedly fun to dip them into all the sauces; all are spicy, bold, sweet; something to satisfy all the tastebuds.  The onion rings are crispy & greasless with a perfect onion to badder ratio; perfect with the ranch sauce.  The fries are crispy golden & definitely hit the spot.  Round it off with one of their house beers & you will not be disappointed.  So, for wonderful pub grub at reasonable prices with friendly service in a friendly upbeat atmosphere, Rock House cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"We visit this bar every year because it has cheap drinks and beer pong. When I'm buying drinks for 11 direct reports, I'd like them to be on the less expensive side :) Rockhouse typically has someone standing at the top of the escalator when you enter the Venetian, handing out coupons for buy 1- get 1 cocktails (the drinks are only about $7 to start with, so it's a pretty good deal- especially when you consider that just downstairs there's a bar with $19 vodka cranberries). You can also order pitchers of beer, and it's $4 for a beer pong set (balls and solo cups).   I will warn you, it's loud, and it's club-type music. Also, there's a bull, and some of the folks who get on it tend to be... well, not fun to watch.   Still, I like this place. It's the perfect place to start off the night and buy a few rounds, get everyone a little buzzed before heading over to one of the casino bars. And beerpong brings back those college memories :)"}
{"text":"It sucks.... I liked it better when drinks were dirt cheap and it was at the  imperial palace and it used to be good music and chicas bonitas"}
{"text":"Literally, the worst service I have ever experienced. And I don't write bad reviews as a practice, but this is actually comical. I'm actually experiencing it right now and writing a play by play. We have been seated for 20 minutes and no help. I went to the bartender to order drinks and ask for menus, and I had to pull her away from the manager flirting with her and talking about her watch. I asked the bartender to flag us some service, and 15 minutes later and after watching the server text for several minutes, she magically appeared. This place is nice in theory. If I could give a zero I would."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars to be honest is because it doesn't seem to attract a crowd..on a Friday. Now trust, I am not one to like being packed like sardines but a good decent sized crowd here and there isn't bad.   We were drawn here because some kid gave us a drink promo ticket. We didn't end up using it but we DID have $5 jager bombs and bought a $20 pitcher and played beer pong. BEER PONG! I realize now that the amount of germs we probably consumed by playing BP in a bar was probably ridiculous, but clearly we didn't care. The bartenders were really chill and they have an electric bull! LADIES! Please, if you are wearing a dress..not the best time to jump on that thing.  If you are not into a place with a strict dress code and a chill environment (I say this because we were in formal dresses/toms/flip flops and track pants), check this place out."}
{"text":"I was here a couple months ago during a trip to Las Vegas. This place is located inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino. It is located next to Carlo's Bakery.   We stopped in here simply because we had been to visit Carlo's Bakery, but they had nowhere to sit and eat what we had bought. I find this annoying, but such is life. There were tables at the entrance here, so we asked the bartender if we could sit and eat. We weren't customers, but she welcomed us to sit and eat. She offered us samples that she was handing out, which was nice. If we weren't leaving Vegas an hour after this stop, I would have taken the time to check out the menu and have a drink.   The customer service was great, especially given the fact all we wanted to do was sit and eat something we had bought next door. I definitely appreciated that, and the fact the bartender had no problem with this. It was sweet. We weren't there for long, but she engaged us in conversation, and just gave excellent customer service.   Would I return? Yes. Based on the customer service, it would definitely be somewhere I would return and take the time to eat and drink here. It was a great experience. Which seemed to be a trend while we were in Vegas. For as busy as it was, everyone was kind and helpful.   Review 115 of 2017."}
{"text":"I came here for a March Madness special they were having last weekend, unlimited draft beers and well drinks all day for $50.  Needless to say, I had a great time!  I was actually here when it was Smokin' Hot Aces a few years ago.  I really like what they've done with the rennovations and decor.  The Rockhouse is actually a decent venue albeit the location (2nd floor of the Venetian l Palazzo down a corridor by Barney's New York and across from First Food) isn't exactly the best.  Unfortunately, I have never been to the old Rockhouse at Imperial Palace, so I have no basis of comparison.  Our server, Ashley, was incredibly friendly and charismatic.  She did a great job taking care of our large group during such a busy time.  The food is pretty good for bar food.  Just a note though, most of their portions are small, almost tapas-esque.  I had the chipotle chicken sliders.  They had a nice tame kick to them.  I kept seeing people order the tacos and mini corn dog thingys (which were really cute btw) and all the food received moans and nods of approval.   The bar has 65 TVs, pool tables, foosball, beer pong, a mechanical bull, cheap drinks, and multiple entry points. I highly recommend it if you're on the strip or in town visiting."}
{"text":"Do not come here!!!! Came in with a party of 11, during lunch time, not busy at all.  We got moved tables three different times, finally put our drink order in with our waitress, .....then crickets for 30 minutes.... Finally had a new waitress come over with a tray of a few drinks, had to re-order several of the drinks... The new waitress had a serious attitude and told proceeds to tell us that our waitress had completely just walked off the job, and that basically she's doing us a favor taking our order....um wow okaaaayyyy... The manager is standing by the bar doing absolutely nothing... Off she goes to the bar to put in our order of 6 more ice teas and cokes... Or whatever the simple order was... I even walked up to the bar after waiting so long for a cold glass for my beer...Another 15-20 minutes go by and she finally comes back and still doesn't have all the drinks...unbelievable... And remember we are getting attitude the entire time... We all decide we will not be dining there, I ask for my tab and she brings the entire check, ATTITUDE HUGE now, manager still doing nothing... The check for watered down ice teas ice melted, and one warm beer is $42!!!! No one did anything to let our party know about the waitress issue or even offer to pick up the ice teas which cost them about .10 cents... The waitress was the worst, the manager is useless, and all they wanted wS their $42 + tip for ice teas!!!!!!      In my opinion being in Vegas a million times being at dive bars to the most elegant, .... This place is by far the worst experience I have EVER had in Vegas in my entire life!!!!!!!!!"}
