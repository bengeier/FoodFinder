{"text":"This place is great.  It opens early and you can get a coffee and two tasty samosas for breakfast for $2.50.   It's a convenient location too if you are heading somewhere in city centre or just changing trains / buses.  Long live Amin Donairs!"}

{"text":"I tried Amin Donairs for the first time.  It was a huge donair for a regular size and really inexpensive.  Just $5.75 plus tax.  Amin, the owner, prepared my donair and found out that I liked hot sauce.  He was so happy to hear that I liked hot sauce that he put 3 kinds of hot sauce on my donair!  2 red chilli sauce and 1 green sauce.  When I ate it, it had a kick but I still need more hot sauce.  The donair meat was stacked quite high on melted cheese and the veges - tomatoes, onions, cilantro - added freshness to the donair.  The white sauces he added were pretty good - a sweet white sauce and some garlic sauce as well.  Quite a well blended donair.  Make sure you have lots of napkins.  It's quite a messy eat.  We had a group lunch and we also ordered  a large fries and some samosas.  The fries were quite good and doused with seasoning salt.  The samosas were flat triangle guys.  Not too bad - minced beef and onions and green vegetable that I can't identify..  Will definitely have to come back and try their lentil soup on Mondays and Goat Curry on Rice on Wednesdays for $5.  Yes, you heard me, $5!!"}
