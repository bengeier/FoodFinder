{"text":"You will be disappointed if you expect the same quality from the Sukho Thai on Parliament.   Ordered my usual go-to dishes and they are totally like $6.99 food court quality.  Nothing compared to the original Sukho Thai.   Save yourself $15.5 for better Thai food out there."}
{"text":"Went there after going to the Christmas Market, it was one of the few restaurant that were still open. It's a small restaurant (not very many seats available) with a lot of customers. Servers are nice and friendly. The food comes in good portion, delicious too. The price is fair, not cheap but definitely worth it. I would recommend this place and go back again."}
{"text":"It finally opened! There is not much to eat in the area and its such a great addition to the neighborhood!    The restaurant is quite small with only 20 seats between 7-8 tables. The interior is quite dark with a red glow and bamboo lantern lights, It's quite dark with not a lot of signage but look for the picnic tables outside. Our server was emotionless but was fine. The lady at the front counter was lovely and nice though.   We arrived at 5.30 pm for an early dinner for 3 people on a Sunday night and it wasn't packed, only 1 other table but when we left around 6.30, there were a few other tables filled. There were a ton of people in and out getting take-out and delivery though, it was almost non-stop!  We started with the shrimp chips and tamarind dipping sauce ($5), this is easily my favourite reason to go to Sukho Thai, slightly peppery, really crispy, lots of shrimp flavour with the sauce that is a bit sour and salty - so satisfying and the perfect snack that I can't stop eating.   The chicken coconut soup was good but it was just too sour (Tom Kha Gai, $12 for dinner portion with rice) I also got the Gaeng Masaman curry ($15), again it was a bit too sour and the beef was on the chewier side. But it was still pretty good and the potatoes were perfect soft spheres. I got medium, but it wasn't spicy at all.   The Panang Salmon ($18)  was the best! Perfectly cooked, a good crust and still moist in the middle and it was a good portion. The sauce was creamy and the grilled asparagus was crispy and got that slightly charred taste which I like!   It was almost $60 for 3 people, and we were all stuffed with a bit of leftover curry and rice to take home. I would definitely come back because of the area and get the other items or if not just for the shrimp chips!"}
{"text":"I love this place. While the interior is small in the winter and only seats about 20, they have benches and tables outside in the summer to accommodate more people. I've tried many of their dishes - pad kee mao, khao soi, masaman curry, spring rolls, squash fritters - and all have been delicious! The one thing I wasn't crazy about were the cold rolls. The staff is so nice and friendly, and service has always been quick. I've eaten in and also picked up for take out. So glad they are in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"There's only around 20 seats or so- we got really lucky because we were seated right away and a line formed after us.   We got the khao soi, pad Thai, beef satay skewers, Tom Yum soup, and masaman curry. We ordered medium spice for all of them, and was informed that the Tom yum soup is going to be a bit spicier than medium- our server was right. It was super rich and definitely packed best but had a nice smoky flavour.   The khao soi was not spicy at all- probably because of the coconut milk base. It was delicious but quite small.   The pad Thai is probably one of the best around the GTA. Could be personal preference, but it was just the right amount of tamarind and spices. Also not oily or overlooked.   Skewers were pretty small as well- 4 for $12. Very thin but tender. Nothing too special.   We had the shrimp masaman curry but I find that the rice that it came with was too small for all the curry they gave. We ordered extra rice just to soak up all the delicious curry. Even though it was medium spice, I'd have to say that it's spicier than the standard \"medium\" at most places. I eat quite spicy so this is just a warning to those who don't, based on my friends' reaction to the soup, curry, and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Very very small location. The food was good however the service was slow and seating is extremely limited. The menus is also a mini menu version - doesn't look like it has the full menu like at the Wellington location - disappointing. I think taking a few extra minutes to get to the Wellington location is better then coming to this one."}
{"text":"I've been craving Thai food a lot recently, I think. I came in here on a Saturday afternoon. It must've just open for lunch as I was the only one there. But that meant I got quick and friendly service.   I really liked the good here. I thought the flavors we're really good here. I started with the crispy spring rolls which were delicious. Then I had the gaeng masaman. I loved the tamarind sauce it was made with, which have it a tartness that made it taste so good. I had a that ice tea to go along with all of this. The portion was huge, so needless to say, I had plenty of left overs. Which I glad do try to eat and saved for the next day. But the other reason was too make room for dessert. I ordered the cassava cake, which reminded me so much of cassava cake I used to eat growing up. This was very sweet though, and I wish they would cut back on the sweetness by half. But regardless, I still loved it.  The meal was great overall. Other than the sweetness level of the cassava cake being too sweet, I thought the rice came served on a weird plate. It was too small to eat directly from. I guess I was supposed to mix it into the curry? But I prefer eating it where the curry is poured over there rice, I guess. They were happy to give me a bigger plate though, so I was able to happily eat it my way!  Location wise, it's got maybe 15-20 seats. I suspect they'll have outdoor seating in the summer. But currently there are a small number of tables. I'd call ahead and make a reservation just in case, before coming"}
{"text":"Stoked that this place is finally open! IMO one of the best thai restaurants in toronto. If you haven't tried, stop by here or one of the other 3 locations.  My go to is the khao soi (not sure if I'm spelling that right). Very rich, creamy curry noodles that is perfect for the fall/winter season.   All the other food options are amazing. Service is really good too!   Heads up: this location is very new so they are not liquor licensed yet. (Should be soon)"}
{"text":"This location is perfect and intimate! Though it gets kind of cold when anyone goes in or out!   The food is almost the same as the front and church location. However, just a slight difference. It's not as spicy but I enjoyed it nonetheless.   They have different appetizers as well! We can't wait to try the beef satay!   Decor and atmosphere was 5 stars and the food was 4 stars! Definitely worth the price!"}
