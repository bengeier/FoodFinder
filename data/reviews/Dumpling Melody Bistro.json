{"text":"I am a fan of Cantonese Chow Mein and here its is better than most. I have not encountered the sticky floor or being sick for several days after a meal as some one has previous posted. I have notice the portions are not consistent with the take out. As a local restaurant I would support it."}
{"text":"The first sign of things to come.was the incredibly sticky floor. I almost pulled my hip out of its socket, unstinking my foot, after standing in one spot too long. 

I ordered the Ma Po Tofu, which took a fairly long time to prepare, especially considering there didn't seem to be any other customers or orders ahead of me. 
I took my order back to my office, I can't say my expectations were very hi, but, upon opening the container, I discovered it only contained Tofu and some sauce. 

For some reason I have always thought one of the key ingredients of the dish is ground pork. 

It's been in the dish whenever I have ordered it at numerous other restaurants around the city. 
My apologies if this is not a normal ingredient and all the other places have gotten it wrong by including it in their versions of the dish. 

Needless to say, my quest for a halfway palatable, reasonably priced lunch in this area continues. 

On the plus side, the decor will keep you amused, an eclectic blend of record jackets, a showcase full of crystal piano music boxes, home stereo centre and a mini bike/chopper on a stage. 

The memories will have to suffice, as I can't say I enjoyed feeling like an insect trapped on a glue board, or the taste of the food in my mouth.
 
Will never return."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here and I gotta say I am pleasantly surprised. The food all tastes very fresh. We ordered general tao chicken, beef and broccoli, chicken wings, steamed pork dumplings and pan fried chicken dumplings. The general tao is nice and spicy and not too sticky sweet. The beef and broccoli could use more flavour but it isn't overly salty which is good. The dumplings are large and quite tasty. I especially like the pork ones as they taste nice and gingery. The chicken wings aren't bad but at $10 for six average sized wings they're kind of a rip off. I'll order from here again."}
{"text":"Went there ate the fish stew and rice and i puked 7 times the day after. So if you enjoy puking, this is the best place to go!"}
{"text":"A friend goes to school around here and my most recent visit here deserves a review, they have changed chefs and the food has improved tremendously! The sweet and sour dishes are very good, especially the fish! it's super fluffy and moist on the inside with a nice batter and great flavour. the braised pork is amazing and full of flavour. for appetizers the dumplings and spring rolls are on point! I also had the canoness chow mein and that was very good, the noodles are crunchy and I like it with the sauce of those noodles so it's soft and crunchy at the same time. they are famous for spicy dishes but I can't take spice right now, but will definitely try in the future. 

the inside is very roomy and washrooms are clean! but parking is a but hard in this tight parking lot, but most students just walk over."}
{"text":"Tried this place for first time and I was very unimpressed. I ordered a couple of dishes as takeout and  I would not recommended it. Their customer service is very bad as it look a very long time for them to complete my order even though there was no one in the restaurant. The dishes were very bland and tasteless. 

Also, when I got home and opened some of the dishes, I realized it was one of the items not what I ordered. I called the restaurant to explain to them about it and they seemed to not understand and say they cannot do anything about this. 
Overall this place has very bad customer service and need to improve themselves!"}
{"text":"This is such a lovely place. The food is just fine but it's the ambience.  An outstanding and eclectic record collection or Saturday aft or evening jazz from local Humber College students make this a warm and friendly place. Spare yourself the condescension of the snobby food set that appears in some of the other reviews and instead immerse yourself in beautiful jazz from a perfect audiophonic system served by a lovely co-owner who is fun and down to earth. 

Don't worry about fancy or trendy. Just enjoy."}
{"text":"It's a disgusting restaurant!!!! Went there for lunch, ordered a roasted duck and fried rice. Duck smelled really bad so couldn't finish it, rice was oozing with oil with almost no chicken or eggs. The bill came as 25.95 (wtf!?) where as it was supposed to be 22 dollars, fine I didn't argue, I didn't have 15 cents so I told the server I'm coming back and then she demanded I pay with my card, I was like okaaaaaaay..... Then I found like 5 dollars in my bag and gave her 30.55 dollars but she only gave me two dollars back!!  I asked her why, she's like the rest is the tip that I have to pay for which was NOT mentioned in the bill, why would I pay for terrible food and service???  She insisted I pay her tip, I didn't argue with that cheap lady, just left the restaurant, never going back!!! Just beware of their unmentioned tip thing for shitty food, go to Ranu Thai restaurant just a few blocks away, much much better service and fresh food made in front of you from scratch! Never go to that shitty disgusting bistro place!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant in Long Branch, they opened only 7 weeks ago.  I won't comment on their decor yet because I can tell they're still trying to find themselves.

The only reason I gave this new business only 3 stars is because they do not have any vegetarian dishes, even the dishes that \"look\" vegetarian on their menu, have meat or fish sauce.  I do not fault them for this, I will keep asking for at least one dedicated veggie option, I am optimistic that they'll create one soon :) I will update this review then.
I was dining with omnivores and they seemed to really enjoy their food. If you eat meat, I think you'll be happy here."}
{"text":"This place is truely sad... Their name says Dumpling but they are all store bought and not made in store.  The other food items are tasteless and WAY overcooked.  There is only one server who runs around like crazy to serve all the tables, and that in a way takes away from the whole service provided.  They have lunch specials starting from 4.99 but nothing worth ordering is at that price range and they do come with a drink (canned pop or a boxed juice).  Their noodles lack flavor, nice colour but they forgot the flavoring spice when preparing.  Their other foods are very well done (in a way it is a good thing as you will not get sick from under cooked foods but if I really wanted a meat jerky, I would have ordered it.  They do have an area with a keyboard, drum set and a cello, assuming for live music in evenings but not interested in trying it out for that.
I will keep looking for a half decent/ acceptable Chinese eatery in the Etobicoke area and try out other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"It's an okay restaurant for the neighborhood but not great. If you're stuck for a quick meal, then it's okay to go here but I'm not in a hurry to order anytime soon.

Service is quick and friendly. Price is on the very cheap side for food. 

The congee was odd, it wasn't the right consistency, too liquidy (is liquidy a word?!). I haven't been to a Chinese restaurant that can screw up congee as so was quite surprised. The sizzling beef dish is tasty but not fantastic. I would order it again if I'm too lazy to drive far for Chinese food. There aren't many places in Etobicoke, sadly. Other dishes were just B-."}
{"text":"ordered some food off of justeat.ca, after ordering a decent amount of food, i found myself not liking any of it. the flavor combinations were weird at best, or just plain. the wraps promoted pancakes in them? had it, no pancakes in mine, as well the wrap came delivered in four pieces and soggy. the chicken fried rice was extremely plain, as if they just took plain white rice, some chicken, some corn and peas, and threw it into the same bowl. every time that ive ordered on justeat.ca this place pops up and offers a 20% off over 35$, i would gladly pay the extra 20% for some flavor. highly disappointed. wont order again."}
