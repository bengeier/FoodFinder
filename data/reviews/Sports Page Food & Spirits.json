{"text":"Love this restaurant..the good is always prepared correctly and always hot!  Try their wraps and sweet potatoe fries!"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place! Given its location in the middle of a residential area, its mostly a locals joint. In fact, I know quite a few people who probably eat here more than 4 times a week. The food is always great, lots of veggies and county style entrees. Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd. But hell, who cares.  I would recommend sunday lunch specials. I'll probably be there, so say hello."}
{"text":"Decent. the food and wings are pretty good. normally they are pretty slow and a long wait. always pretty loud. not bad for a quick brunch. I'd recommend the cheese fries or the chaser salad are always outstanding."}
{"text":"They need to get rid of the odor in the men's room coming into the dining room on the bar side."}
{"text":"Been going there for over 2 decades. Consitently good and the nightly specials are my favs; Taco Tuesdays, burger Wednesdays and fajita Thursdays are all great!"}
{"text":"Sports Page used to be a fun spot & I've been going for nearly 10 years. I just recently moved to the area but used to travel to Charlotte to meet with friends & we would always meet there. The last 3 times I've went is was drastically worse. The bartender ignored us (each time)...It seemed like a bar where only locals are welcome. The food has gone downhill as well. I couldn't even finish the nachos...mostly because I had no drink to wash it down. They still have potential but I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I have such fond memories of 1982.  I'm glad the Sports Page could bring them back with their assortment of old Sports Illustrateds and other sports pictures.  This place is cozy and friendly.  It's dated to...well...1982...and they weren't even located here in 1982.  I'm inclined to like places like this for that reason alone.  The food is what you'd expect from a classic southern joint.  It's good, it's probably fried, and there is a variety of digs to choose from.  There's nothing spectacular about anything, but there's nothing to complain about either.  I'm still waiting for that dish that makes me add another star...but for now....Sports Page is an average experience."}
{"text":"I'm visiting the Charlotte area with my children on business this week.   I picked this place b/c of the kids eat free meal on Mondays per adult entree plus it was only 10 minutes away from my hotel.  We were eager to try something new... This was my 1st and last time going to this place.  1st when I went to place the order as I was asking my children if they would like fries and apples with their dinner the waitress says \"you can't make substitution on a free meal\" ... I turned to her and said I never asked you for a substitution.  However If my children don't desire to have something I wouldn't ask you to bring it.  So at that point I feel like were already off to a bad start with the waitress.  I place my order.  She brought out our salads quickly and literally less than 2 minutes later all of our food is brought out by another server... I'm like really we had just got our salads on our plates and started eating good... We weren't ready for the entree yet.  So what do you do? It was so unexpected for me that I didn't even say anything as my spaghetti & cheesy bread just sat there and got cold.  Along with the chicken tenders and fries. In the back of my mind I'm thinking about my options here ask them to take it back while I eat & bring it back later... or ask them to reheat once I'm done or what??? I just left it alone and we ate our food cold.  My daughters never got their drink for the kids meal.  Then to the put the icing on the cake as the waitress delivered the bill I had turned to grab my wallet out of my purse & she took the entire plate of french fries that the children had not finished eating & were also planning to take with them.  (The kids were at the restroom when this happened) So the kids come back and are like \"Wheres the fries Ma\" She took them.... So I told her she took them and that they weren't even finished eating their food...I had planned to get a carryout tray for it.  She said I'm sorry I thought you were done. There was no I'll get you a small order of fries to replace that.  Or nothing to fix what she did just an I'm sorry.  So I'm fully convinced..... Wont be eating here again..."}
{"text":"We originally tried the take out from SportsPage and we loved it so much we decided to try dining in.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly greeter and shown to our table. After about 15mins our waitress finally showed up. She was very nice and took our drink order, which we got 10mins later. Once the rest of our party arrived we waited another 10mins before our waitress came to get their drink order. After another waiting period the rest of our party got their drinks, except one had the wrong type of drink. When ordering a Johnny walker black, he revived the red label and was never told they don't carry the black label. The food arrived 30mins after we ordered and it was cold. Despite being cold it was very yummy. The one thing that really made us question coming back was my beer. It had a moldy orange in it. One that neither the waitress nor the bartender noticed?! When called out to the waitress her reply was \"I didn't notice\"."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars but that wasn't an option. We just left there after an hour of waiting for our food. As soon as our server finally got to us we ordered everything, asking for the salmon dinner that we ordered for the kids to share to come out as soon as it was ready as well as our appetizer of cheese fries. 15 minutes later I asked our server if our salmon was almost done or the fries and she said 10 more minutes... after another 15 minutes they brought out the salmon dinner but when we cut into it, it was completely RAW in the middle. I asked for the manager and he said they would remake it. 10 minutes later they came back with another piece of RAW salmon. Mind you, my husband an I still had not gotten our entrees which we orders as soon as our server greeted us. The manager, Lucky blamed the kitchen and the server. After watching every other table get sat and fed (many of them having to wait a long time to even get drinks) we couldn't wait any longer and had to leave. So we had been there an HOUR, gotten 2 pieces of raw salmon, water and cheese fries. We left starving, with two hangry babies, and no food. Easily the worst dining experience of my life. Will never be back here again."}
{"text":"Hey you know that sports bar with a just-okay beer selection but really yummy potato skins and ranch cheese fries and nachos that all of the teachers hang out at because they give them half off of those yummy apps?  Oh yeah, sports page. Let's go. Meet you at 4:30."}
{"text":"I've eaten here in several occasions and have placed many take out orders as well. Take out is a little slow, so I advise to call it in ahead. With that said, my meals are always temperature appropriate and very tasty."}
{"text":"It is a chain sports bar, not too many other options in the area if this is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you expect from the Sports Bar scene. The restaurant and bar are separated which is nice for families. The decor is a bit run down but it's right in line with the expectation.   The menu is huge for such a small place. Lots of bar essentials like nachos, burgers, and wings. We split the nachos and the pimento burger. The nachos were good with cheese melted on them, not a sauce. The ground beef had tons of seasoning and mixed into the layers of chips. The guacamole, salsa, and sour cream on the side were good placement.   The burger was well cooked but still had tons of flavor. The additional toppings were a little much but really good at the same time. The bread was too thick but still had good flavor. The fries were pretty standard and didn't have any weird residual flavor from other items.   The service was good and you can tell they work as a team. It's a very casual spot so stop by anytime."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food, good atmosphere, polite staff  Cons: Orders incorrect half the time, staff tends to be not very attentive (but polite^)  I rated this overall 4 stars because it's one of the places in my boyfriend & my's repertoire of restaurants.   I'm a picky eater and often just enjoy a baked potato and salad when we visit, while the boyfriend tends to order the Philly cheese steak. (We do get other things).   I would recommend it to friends. Relaxed atmosphere and affordable!"}
{"text":"Go here a lot and the place is good. They actually excel in the specials on Tuesday Taco night and Thursday Fajita Night.   Just the best bar food around this side of town and the Sunday specials are really great too."}
{"text":"Great food. I have never had a meal at Sportspage I didn't like. Excellent wings, burgers, veggies, and specials. The veggies are not over salted and are always fresh. The cobblers are incredible. You won't be disappointed! Tuesday nights they have poker. Good crowd and a lot if fun!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here several times and have never been disappointed with the food or service. This place is a hidden gem! I had the seared tuna salad today and I'm in love! I want to eat it every day! My boyfriend got the chicken fajita salad and it was HUGE and also very delicious. Great place!"}
{"text":"Large parties beware. We arrived today (Sunday) well before the post-church rush, just before noon. We had a large party (12) and were told the wait would be 15-20 mins.  At 12:40 we were told there was a large party who had 12:30 reservations and if they did not show within 10 minutes we would be seated next.  That would have had us being seated at 12:50, a fifty minute wait.  The large party arrived, and we were then told they did not know when they could seat us, and the wait would likely be another 45 minutes.  Included in our party were children and a diabetic, so on to Wendy's we went. I totally get that it was Sunday and we were a large party. However, we were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which became 1.5 hours. Sports Page consistently struggles with seating large parties during high volume times and needs to figure out an efficient process for accommodating these parties. Also, holding a reservation for 20 minutes is unacceptable.  We are lifetime Westsiders (as a matter of fact our rehearsal dinner was at Sports Page), however I don't know when or if we will return."}
{"text":"Food is just OK, high turn over of employees who are terrified to make a mistake, they charge for extra sauce if you run out, food is not consistent never know when your going to get the same quality because the manager has no clue how to run a restaurant. Very sad because this area really needs a good place to eat and the only reason this place is in business is that there is no competition."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price! The food options are good but the quality can be inconsistent. Sometimes it's made right and sometimes it's off for various different reasons. They've got daily lunch specials and their Taco Tuesday's are awesome!"}
{"text":"We typically like Sports Page for a quick dinner or a night out with friends and the kids. Tonight ruined those plans for us in the future. We specifically called ahead to be sure one of the tacos could be prepared for our daughter  who has an allergy. Katherine was our server and was completely UNCOOPERATIVE and blatantly rude as soon as my husband said \"our daughter has an allergy\" She started saying \"wait, what, what, what..???\" Needless to say, we got the check and paid for the drinks (that we did not drink) and left. It's pretty safe to say we will NEVER be back. Best of luck SP we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok it's my 3rd time here today and I'm convinced this place has nothing on the menu that's shy of amazing. I had the chicken sandwich and spinach dip tonight. Both amazing. You're probably thinking \"really? A chicken sandwich?\" Yes!!! A &$&\"@!? Chicken sandwich. Must try it it's uh-@&$$&!?- mazing! And this is the Thursday special!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place an extra star because our waitress was so nice. Chicken was like rubber. Pork tacos had fat all over them and the burger had absolutely no taste! Everything we ordered was horrendous! So disappointed because the menu really looked good and it's down the street from our house. I will come back for a drink since they have a cute bar but will never order food"}
{"text":"Lunch here was great, with the location of my new job it's hard to find great lunch spots. This place is literally 3minutes from my job which is great. I went at noon and it was very packed but I was seated within 5minutes. My appetizer came out very quickly then it took a while for my hamburger. Everything was presented very well and very hot. Servers were great and provided excellent service. Overall a great experience here and I plan to go back"}
{"text":"The Sports Page is a great local restaurant that fills the niche for the Coulwood area in Charlotte. Every time I am in that area at 12:00 noon, I try to go by for lunch. They have a great variety of food at very reasonable prices. On Friday, they have flounder, and that entree with a baked potato and the house salad is all that one one would want. The food is well prepared with generous portions. This is definitely a 'go to' restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years and everyone is friendly and the food is always tasty. The ribeye steak sandwich is my favorite."}
{"text":"I always get the daily special.  It's always good.  Friendly, efficient staff.  I know it's a sports bar but they have a great southern vegetables lineup on the menu.  I especially like their tacos and wings.  Kids eat free on Monday's and Tuesday's."}
{"text":"A bit pricey considering the amount of food you get. I got the mixed grill tacos- 2 small tacos, one pork belly, one fish. Comes with chips, salsa and queso. The tacos were delicious I thought, but not worth $11.25. Probably won't be back. Oh, website says you will get 10% off order if you txt to their number but I never received anything- you also have to download their app. Don't waste your time  with that you won't get 10% off."}
{"text":"We've never actually dined in, but we've gotten carry out a few times and the food is pretty good. The staff isn't very attentive, but Im not in there long enough to care. It's a nice option to have right around the corner when I can't or don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Called a togo order in and asked the girl \"do you have a philly cheese steak\" and she said yes it's called the grinder and I said ok sounds good. When I got home and started eating I noticed it didn't taste like a philly cheese steak at all. I looked at the menu and it is a roast beef sandwich. I don't enjoy eating roast beef. This sandwich had no flavor and was not very good. I basically just bought my dog a $10 sandwich. I've eaten here before and the other food I have gotten was good. I just wish the girl who answered the phone knew that a roast beef sandwich and a philly cheese steak are NOT the same. I would have gotten something else to eat."}
{"text":"I've only eating here at lunchtime but I've never had a bad meal here. Service is great and the food is great. Plenty of TV's so you can catch any game you want to watch."}
{"text":"Yes the decor is dated, yes the food isnt amazing all the time, and yes this is a locals pub/restaurant. But come on people its a sports bar/restaurant!! You can't be expecting 5 star food at a sports bar!! Honestly its really pretty decent place to pick up a meal.  The Sports Page is just a block away from my parents house so I tend to come at least once when I'm visiting for a meal or two. When you first enter you can go to the left for the bar or right for the restaurant. There are tons of sports memorabilia on the walls to look at and tables and booths to sit at. But be warned the booth seats are dead and need new springs, some of them make you feel like a midget. And of course there are plenty of TVs around so you can keep up with the game. The bar area also has a small stage and they have bands come and play music usually every week.  The guaranteed winner every time is their Steak Salad its really tasty and filling. I've had their St. Louis Ribs and they are just ok. I guess I need to try more items but its hard when I only get there every once in a while. The service is friendly and my parents know most of the waitresses as they are regulars at the Sports Page.   Overall its a good place to eat if you're in the area, and if you want to watch a game with your buds I'd say the bar would be a solid choice also."}
{"text":"This is as strong of a three star as it gets without going up to four stars - and perhaps after my next visit they will go up a star or two.  Pricing, selection, parking. service, cleanliness were all good. I'm not a big fan of a sports place, but when with colleagues I am often out numbers so this place was better than most sports bars I've been at."}
{"text":"Had lunch today where I am training. It was brought in for all the attendees probably about 40 people. Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, green beans and some peach cobbler. Sweet tea. Plenty of food, not real spicy but tasty just the same. Rolls provided were a little dry. Overall, a good lunch. Not remarkable, but good just the same."}
{"text":"$4 for this? That's just pathetic. The only great thing about this establishment is their online ordering service. Other than that, everything is decent."}
{"text":"Im not sure how this place could not get a high rating?  I enjoyed it tremendously, the service and food were phenomenal. Now before I go into my meal let me tell you that The Onion Rings here deserve to be in a restaurant hall of fame.  They were beyond outstanding. Not being from charlotte I don't know every place that has O rings but this one is my favorite!  Now My friend had a reuben and I had the Grouper fish taco's.  Totally fantastic. Great food get there r"}
{"text":"Sports Page is a West side classic. I have been eating there for many years. Way back when they were still in the original location at 16 and Hoskins. Anyway, I assumed they had tons of reviews until i looked. So here goes... I ate lunch there last week and had something new, the fish tacos. I like how they keep adding new things to the menu and this is one of the newer additions. You can get the fist grilled, blackened, or fried, I chose fried and it was cooked to perfection. Crisp, hot and fantastic. The tortilla was good and the cabbage added the traditional touch. Comes with chips, salsa, and really good queso. Check it out along with the Cuban sandwich, Steak sandwich or the classic Chicken Monterrey. Decor is standard sports bar kitsch but the place is clean and vibrant, service is really good, and nearly everything I have had there has been extremely well done and consistent. Stop in sometime."}
{"text":"Food Taste: 6  Food Temp.: 6  Order Accuracy: 9  Speed of Service: 6  Server Attentiveness: 7  Host Friendliness: 10  Environment: 9  Cleanliness: 9  Restroom Clean: 9  We used to go here all the time. The fried mozzarella is great. The hoagie is one of my favorite things. Specials are usually good too. Salads are hit and miss. The chicken is almost always rubbery. I've had cold fries a lot and I've had to return them. I hope the food quality improves."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and just a great place to stop for lunch. Don't expect gourmet but instead expect a good bang for the buck place to stop for lunch. I have yet to have a bad item off the menu and make an effort to order something different every time. The steak sandwich is awesome !"}
{"text":"***Please read this whole review to understand why I only rated 1 star.  I'm writing this review in hope of management seeing it so things can change. I really did not want to give sports page a bad review. In fact, I usually rave about sports page especially about their taco Tuesday. With that said, here's the deal. I have been to SP in Denver dozens of times and have never had a bad meal or experience, Their Taco Tuesdays are amazing!  So I was excited to go out tonight for taco Tuesday and we chose the Charlotte restaurant instead of the Denver location because we were closer to it. For starters the waitress wasn't very friendly at all and looked pissed off to be there. But in any event, I order my usual tacos that I always get and was ready to enjoy them. When I got them they looked a little less full then normal and kinda of just tossed together quick.  The favor was weak and they were very runny and not even very hot. I was so pumped for taco Tuesday and I left almost angry and unsatisfied, this was very disappointing.  I can't understand how the favor and quality can vary so much between the two restaurants.  So Denver SP = 5 stars ( always great), Charlotte SP= 1 star (get it together)"}
{"text":"The several times I've been here or gotten food to go, it's just been ok.  I've never been amazed by much here.  It's a sports bar, for sure.  I think most sports bars I've been to would get 3 stars from me, but a select few have good food.  This place is just ok.  I've had a burger here, blah.  The reuben was mediocre and soggy.  I will say, the chicken tenders here are definitely worth eating.  Just thinking about them makes me crave them a bit.  They are that good, in my opinion.  If you're big on sports and drinking, this might be a fine place for you, but I've not been there for either of those on any occasion I've been.  They have some very affordable options, which is a big plus."}
{"text":"ive heard nothing but good things about this restaurant from friends, neighbors and yelp....   well ill just say this was my first and last time at the sports page. first off our server acted like she could care less. second there was a pit of an avacado left in the guacamole and chips i was served. third there was a short black hair on my sandwich. fourth and final, the server brought the check but we couldnt ever get her to come back to the table i was calling out to her as i was walking to the door i decided to take the check with cash to her, she ignored me...acted like i wasnt even there...i just laid the receipt on the table with the cash and left. what a crappy restaurant...the food was mediocre at best... my boyfriends burger looked good but wasnt that great...by the way... and if i wanted to complain to a manager or something i figured there was no point...i just let it go and will never be darkening their doorstep ever again..."}
{"text":"We stopped by for Tuesday night poker and were surprised to find so many people here for sit down food service. The bar was also packed. Good amount of tvs, but not as much as Duckworth's or BWW. They had Taco Tuesday specials going on, I went with the $2.50 shrimp tacos. I preferred the (bang bang?) shrimp over the Caribbean jerk shrimp. I wish the server was more attentive, I waited a good 20 minutes for her to come back so I could get the wifi password. But food and atmosphere are good :)   Will be back for more Tuesday night poker for sure, a lot closer than the Fox and Hound poker nights on Thursdays."}
{"text":"I went to this location as part of a large party during the Highland Games nearby.  Things started well as we went through ordering.  It was the food.  Both the delivery and quality.  One thing at a time.  The delivery was tragic.  There were three in our party that waited for nearly 90 minutes.  Yes.  90 minutes.  The only story was that they were working on it.  Finally the manager came out, saying the same thing.  Only when told by another member of our party did they get an apology, not just more excuses.  Those in our party who had this happen didn't have to pay for their dinners, as would have only be right as everyone else was basically finished eating when their food finally arrived.  As for the quality, our burgers were well done (nearly charred) the \"Cuban\" on \"Cuban bread\" wasn't.  The bread was indeed pressed, but having had Cuban sandwiches from places where they are quite real, those here are not.  For food from a \"Sports Bar\" kind of place, keep looking."}
