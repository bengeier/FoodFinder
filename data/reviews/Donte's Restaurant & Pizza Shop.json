{"text":"I can only comment on the pizza and it is great.  The quality is reliable time and time again.  You can also order various small personal size pies to your liking.  I enjoy adding the roasted red peppers especially!"}
{"text":"My brother insists that Donte's makes the best pizza ever, but I respectfully disagree.  The crust was a little thick and the cheese too abundant for my taste.  The sauce, however, was very good and the toppings evenly distributed.  Prices are very reasonable, and the interior is cool; it looks like it hasn't been updated since the restaurant's 1972 opening.  I think I spotted a full bar in the dimly-lit back of the restaurant, and I imagine that Donte's cheese-heavy pizza tastes absolutely incredible after several drinks, when YOU NEED PIZZA.  NOW."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Took 2hrs to deliver. Food was cold by the time it came to training center. Ask for a well done burger, inside was totally pink. I wld never order, nor go to this place ever again! Waste of money. Guess theres a reason they are cheap!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Donte's fan.  I have tried, really I have!  It's very close to work and I've had the pizza and salad for many work functions and I just can't get myself to like it.  My experience with the pizza is that it is typically greasy and not very flavorful.  It tends to upset my stomach - probably the grease.  I tried to like it again a few weeks ago when we had a work \"pizza party\".  I had my own personal pizza of which I had one tiny piece and put the rest in the fridge \"for later\".  Later never happened.  The salad was ok.  Typical for this type of place and the poppyseed dressing was good.  Just not my kind of pizza place."}
{"text":"Consistantly good pizza and a great rib and bbq sauce recipe(which they will/have split a full slab dinner into two half dinners at the full slab price, for a slight bargain, always including an extra cup of the sauce for takeout orders)."}
{"text":"Please read the review from Janet S. It's like they were sitting at our table, but we had a little more to go with it. We DID finally get to put our order in and there was nothing but Lack of Service, Confusion and chaos after that. I'm not going to put all the details in here, I would only get all flustered again myself.  While waiting for our order to be taken and waiting for the food, no-one came for refills. After Everyone's drinks were empty, we managed to get someone's attention and asked if we could get refills for everyone.  I had no idea that getting refills for 5 people was a four set operation that would take almost 15 minutes, and still forget 1 of them.  If you read this and decide to go anyway, DO NOT ask for mayo!  Wanting to eat before my food was cold, I finally got up and looked in the waitress station that was close to us. No luck. If you needed horseradish sauce or hot sauce, you'd be in luck, but no mayo. So, I asked the first person that I could find , after saying excuse me twice, a girl stopped and said, \"Hi\". I asked, \"Hi, Do you have any mayo\"? She gave me a look like I was speaking Chinese and almost looked terrified,  so I said, \"Mayonnaise, Mayo, Mayonnaise\"...  With NO exaggeration, in the same terrified and really really confused look, she says, \"I have no idea\". The story goes on about that and gets even More confusing, if you can believe that, but that's enough on that...  But the never ending wait for the bill and watching all the unorganized, no communication chaos was simply aggravating. From the time we finally ordered until we got our bill, there were only 2 times anyone even acknowledged that we were there, and that was to bring our 20 minutes refills and to finally bring some MAYO. We could have gotten up and very simply walked out being in no rush at all, but we waited ...   I could go on, but I think between the review from Janet S and what I have here, you'll get the picture.   So, if you like slightly over priced food (but good), don't need any service and can wait a while for your bill, have at it. If you desire a little friendly service and don't have all day to wait, Move along, nothing to see here and that's the facts ma'am, just the facts."}
{"text":"Walking in the place was emptying out at around 10pm. Still plenty of severs around and we were seated in a timely fashion.  The thing I noticed right away was the floors were absolutely atrocious.  Food bits and garbage all over (straw wrappers and napkins). Server was friendly and fairly attentive.  My father ordered a 9 inch veggie pizza and I had a 9 inch peperoni and sausage.  The pizza came in good time and was fresh and hot. Taste was just about average maybe just maybe a bit above average. After eating we were walking out and I noted that on the bar top near the end were lemons in a plastic container with the plastic wrap off and it was next to dirty dishes and cups....pretty gross if you ask me. This is probably all in all a 2.5 star place. To me a dirty restaurant is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"My husband has always raved about this place and I finally got to go...it is as great as he said it was"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and after 10 minutes of waiting to be seated we decided to leave. Food smelled good but service was absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"A-OK. Perfect way to review Donte's.  I was in the area for a work related function all week.  Everyday the eight of us wanted to try something different for lunch.  Day two was this Italian joint called Donte's.  Walking in you will think you stepped back to 1989, as nothing has probably be changed since then.  My favorite decor was the Challenger space shuttle posters located on the one wall.    Traditional Italian restaurant with the red checkered table cloths and wood chairs.  I just ordered a salad and small pizza.  For $3.75 the salad could have been a bit more \"hearty\".  Lettuce was straight out of a bag and dressing from the packet.  The pizza was had good taste and was satisfying.  Overall I would visit again for lunch, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight and I wasn't as pleased with the food as I've been told. The service was wonderful and they weren't very busy so that was probably a plus for us. We had pizza and the bacon was awful. Tasted like pork rinds and there was something off about the pizza. It sat weird in mine and my husbands stomach. We will be sticking to our usual pizza joint; A Slice Above. Sorry Dontes. Maybe another time."}
{"text":"I did not get food so this is not about food. They refused to seat us, refused to let me sit at an empty table and look at menu, then seated a man with 3 kds at that table. Finally a waitress passed and I asked if we could sit down. We sat down and waited. No one came. Finally, after 30 minutes went to hostess station (elderly red haired waitress-rudest person I ever met ever anywhere) was there and told me to wait. I told her no need to talk to me just want a manager. Cute blonde waitress walks up, asked whats wrong and says shed be happy to seat us and serve our table. We thanked her but our baby was getting fussy so we left. Three customers shook their heads in sympathy-one lady even said you have to fight here--waitresses seat their own customers according to what they think their tip will be. Well, I am decent tipper 20percent or better. My daughter adds more to my tip because shes a restaurant manager. Told her she should manage dontes and she said shed never work for such a screwed up place. Guess I never will get to taste the food and undoubtedly will not miss it!"}
{"text":"Food was very filling and the service was fast and hot and prices match quality and quantity."}
{"text":"We came with a large group for a dinner on a Friday night.  The pizza was in the 3-4 stars range, but the service was lacking.  Our servers were nice, but the order got put in wrong so there was a lot of waiting.  The website could use some work.  A couple people got a carafe (or maybe it was a half carafe) of wine, which was a much better value than buying by the glass."}
{"text":"My friend lives a minute from here and we decided to order some pizza delivery. Growing up in BP I have been to Dante's, it's been so long I honestly didn't remember anything other than the fact they were good.   Pizza came quick and it really was piping hot, which was excellent. There was a bunch of us, so we ordered two pizzas and a large salad. The cheese pizza was good. The crust was regular thickness, possibly a little thinner. Maybe a little bland, but that doesn't bother me too much. I bite my pie so I can get a little crust and a little of the cheese and sauce---flavor located, problem solved (so stop whining).   They are heavy handed with the cheese, perfect. I def like my pie cheesy, but when you ask for extra cheese, it always seems to be too much. Dante's hit the nail on the head. And the other pizza (pep and banana peppers) was proportioned perfectly. I don't like too much toppings (personally), I always end up picking a lot of it off. That was a good combination (good idea Dez).   They didn't put too much sauce and I didn't even have to ask for light sauce, now I'm really happy. The sauce itself, could have had a little more oomph. However, I get so annoyed in pizza reviews when people bitch about one aspect of the pie. You either liked it or didn't. Team Dante's.  Why only 3 stars (I swear I planned to give them 4 for those pies)..... salad. We ordered the large tossed salad. It was like $5 or $6 I want to say. Let me start by saying, I'm not cheap. However, I was annoyed I paid that for what was basically all lettuce (and not even the green, leafy kind us girls like).   Yeah, it had one slice of green pepper, very little cheese, one tomato, 2 little bags of croutons (not worth mentioning, at all) and very few slices of cucumber. I have never seen such a stingy salad from a pizza place, ever. WTH. IF I ever order another salad from there I will definitely mention that I was displeased with the amount of goodies in my salad and let them know I expect this one to be better. Ha!"}
{"text":"Went to home and flower show came after service was so slow and tables dirty plates still on them waited 20 min before waitress came for order pizza is great but service sucks might be last time we come here sad now waited 20 for drink refills this is our last time here service is ALLWAYS slow but today is by far the worse ever"}
{"text":"Had a large group which they accommodated. Service was a little slow.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Let's call it more like 3 1/2 stars. The food here is absolutely wonderful. The service well, not so much. The last three times I've been here the service was really quite slow. So obviously this is the kind of place you want to avoid if you're in a hurry. But the food is authentic homemade and delicious. So, if you have some time to kill and want some really, really good pizza then stop in. The pizza is super cheesy! Even the regular ole' rigatoni is good, they have a thick sauce."}
{"text":"live in san fran, want to move this place to california, pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place used to have really good pizza, now it is just mediocre.  It was greasy and bland. We also ordered the \"seafood\" stuffed mushrooms as an app, which consisted of chunks of the fake crab meat with cheese on top.  We were told it would take 20 min for the appetizer to come out.....so we ordered a salad. Again, nothing special - iceberg lettuce with cheese and 2 tomato slices.  Everything was completely tasteless.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't EVER order from this horrible establishment.  I placed an order 2 hrs ago and still haven't received my food.  I called the restaurant and some dumb mfer hung up on me..  She LIED and said the roads were bad and it is not snowing whatsoever.  And then she hung up on me.  Never will I ever spend my money at this place again.  And I will slam them on EVERY social media outlet from here to the moon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here from out of town (virginia beach) ... Nice inside, great service and an awesome Meatball Sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Still on the quest for the best pizza in the city, I tried Donte's. Yet again, disappointment. I go basic here kids, we're talking cheese, garlic, pepperoni. KISS (keep is simple stupid) that way we can really judge who does the best.  Donte's average priced. Nice people. Simple pizza. Not really flavorful.  Peperoni a bit on the scarce side.  Lame sauce and the crust was just eh.  When a girl asks for pepperoni, she expects pepperoni.  .Needless to say, I'm still searching...."}
{"text":"Really? The 2nd Bloody Mary is watery and weak, yes you'll replace it but it is free? Horrible bar,food was fairly good. Penny the server felt very bad about the Bloody Mary but it was not her fault. It was like the bartender ran out of tomato juice and just added some melted ice to it and threw in some horseradish it was really horrible. And then to tell me if I wanted a new one I would have to pay for one I don't think so won't be coming back here again"}
{"text":"Working nearby, I pick up pizza here often to take back to the edit suite.  I've gotta say, over the ten years that I've been going here, the place has begun a bit of a slide downhill in terms of pizza quality.  Oh sure, it's still good enough to satisfy, and it's not greasy or anything awful - it just doesn't have the same pizazz it used to.  In addition, I've become more and more aggravated with how slowly they ring you up.  At any given time, only one person in the store has the authority to ring your order up.  That person never seems to be by the counter and one of the four or five folks standing behind the counter making the orders has to go find them.  This can take one to two minutes.  That may not seem like a long time, but it gets to be super-annoying when you go here on a regular basis and realize the slow and inefficient system for what it is.  I'll keep going to Donte's because it's close to work and the pizza is pretty ok.  However, if a decent competitor pops up anywhere near, I'm dropping Donte's.  I hate waiting."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They screwed up my pizza order TWICE. How hard is it to put tomatoes, spinach and green peppers on a pizza. Come on people. Plus, we waited 20 mins for drinks. Ridiculous. Wouldn't come back.  Update: I finally got my pizza. It's horrible. I'd rather eat the plate it came on. Ew.   Seriously, save the 6 bucks for a 4 slice pizza and go to Pizza Hut. Or hell, a frozen pizza would be better.  I wish I could give this 0 stars. So unimpressed and will never return. Not going to recommend either.  I need to go throw up the nasty taste now. Ick."}
{"text":"Apparently the only pick up order they will do tonight is pizza. Too much to ask for a sub, though we weren't given a reason or even a weak apology. They might just want to disclose that somewhere. Customer service is always pretty poor, but since it's up the street we've put up with it, but after a year we're done."}
{"text":"Very nice little dive style restruant.  The italian food is speciality here.  The lasanga looks to die for and is maybe best thing here.  But Im here for pizza.  Nice ctust not quite thick, definitely not thin.  Crust is not hard and has favor from the sauce in it.  The topping include roasted red pepper, they actually put more on pizza than pepperoni!  Nice sauce - good sauce flavorful but not a zesty sauce by any means.  The cheese even at extra cheese could be thicker.    Okay other than that get the munchie basket.  Everything not healthy but good.  This includes mozzerela sticks, chicken wings, chicken tender, jalopena popper, and onion rings plus a couple sauces.  Very tasty and beats a salad anyday!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here, and the prices are really great. Pizza is really good. I tried the Ribs, but they were dry."}
{"text":"Would never go back. Rude service and horrible food, would have returned it if they were still open. Definitely not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"very good pizza - it's a cleveland style - a mix between deep dish and new york style... very good pizza.solid pizza and good price/service."}
{"text":"Rude, Rude Rude we never tried this place before. We walked in and the lady said there was a wait. I looked around to see 5 tables open. She said that they couldn't seat us because those tables are for 3 or more people. So we sit for about 5 min. She comes back to ask for our names. I was like really there is no one waiting but us. She said in case she's  going to get a rush. I felt almost like she was being a smart***. So we went across the street to tap house bar and grill. The menu was so much better then the items on Dontes."}
{"text":"Great little community restaurant. The service was friendly and helpful. The other customers engaged in interesting conversation when they overheard us talking about Beta fish. BUT people are ordering the wrong food from here, you must try the fried chicken. It was amazing. Sweet, crispy not too greasy. Very good. Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I went to Dante's tonight and their pizza is fantastic! I got the white pizza with spinach and tomatoes and it was awesome. Our waitress was also very friendly and helpful. They have a pretty large drink selection and make most of their food from scratch. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this eating establishment while looking for a place to grab a quick bite near the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  At around 2:30pm on a Saturday, this large restaurant and bar was almost empty. There was nobody at the front counter so we seated ourselves and it was close to 5 minutes before our server came to acknowledge us.  Their menu was diverse, with some daily specials written on a whiteboard facing the entry door. Our party of 3 ordered their fried scallops dinner, fried chicken dinner and a bowl of chili. The coleslaw that came with the dinners were below average, kind of bland. The french fries were hot and crispy but probably frozen and not fresh cut. The fried scallops were tasty but the fried chicken was overdone and dry. Their prices were average and the server was pleasant enough, although she did forget a drink order in the beginning.   I've had better but might return to give them another try if it's convenient."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic! I highly recommend pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper, and sausage. I recently discovered the amazing pairing of Bud Light Lime and pizza here, as well. The servers are beyond friendly and their atmosphere is a dark, underground bar that feels very comfortable."}
{"text":"Ribs and tomato basil pizza did not disappoint- open late!"}
{"text":"Well, we came back to try this place again, because our first experience sitting at the bar was good. Unfortunately this time it was a complete and total disaster. So this review is not about the food. It is about the service, or the lack off service that we did not receive in their restaurant area. We tried to sit at the bar but it was full. Maybe all those people knew something we were soon to find out!  There is only one way I can explain it...Watching the confusion of the whole scene was like watching an old Keystone Cops movie. The wait staff was very inefficient with their workflow and had little to no communication with the costumers. They had tunnel vision and could only do one thing at a time. They could not walk and talk at the same time. If you tried to talk to someone walking they would just hold their finger up indicating \"Just a minute\" and then never get back to you. We were given the \"Just a minute\" finger 4 times. We saw a party of five, another party of four and our party of four all leaving without ever getting served. Other customers just shook their heads in sympathy and said it happens often here. Why they would know that and keep going back....Who knows!    So we may try them again. I believe in the \"Three Times Up to Bat\" Rule. I will try a place three times before I give up on them (everyone can have one bad day). They have one more chance to get my steady business. So far they have one run and one strike. We will see what the next time brings. If you go there, I hope you get them on a homerun day. But whatever your experience, please write a review and let people know. It is important we get a feel for how consistent they are with their food and service. Their ongoing tale is of interest to all food consumers who eat out on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Crappy location Crappy service Crappy food  Nothing memorable other than the fact I could feel my arteries clogging while eating the chicken that was fried in old oil.   Drove all the way home to find out they forgot the coleslaw that was included with my chicken meal.  When I called to notify them they gave an attitude as if ok come up and get it if you want it so bad.   No thanks never again. Plenty of better local food closer to BW campus like Campus Grille and Boca Loca burrito.  If you need fried chicken that bad go to Giant Eagle, it would be about equivalent if not better."}
{"text":"I went to Donte's with a big group (14 people). They only gave us a couple of menus, so we had to share. Which is fine. The waitress was a bit forgetful. I asked for a Diet Coke she brought me Sprite. But that is okay. She was friendly and kind. The bathrooms could use an update. I went in and it was all old! I feel like the door was going to pop off! I was just wondering when the last time they cleaned it! So I would just recommend going before you go to Donte's. The food came out. It was right on time. It was okay. I only had 3 slices, but their pepperoni pizza was good. I would eat here again, but wouldn't recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Had to wait to get our (party of 6) drink/food order in then waited forever to get our food.   Never been served a salad in a restaurant and the dressing is handed to you in a packet.  two of us ordered Spaghetti and meatballs they forgot the meatballs,   waitress then tells us we had to ask for meatballs.  She then gets them and we each get 2 small cold meatballs.  Girlfriend orders ravioli dinner and raviloi's are just put on top of the sauce,  looks like a hurried order of food. Food was just ok,  would not reccomend."}
{"text":"The \"homemade\" sauce for pasta is Ragu!!! Not impressed at all with the food. The \"huge\" $4.25 side salad was as small as a small tea cup saucer.... The fries in my sons burger were dried out and overlooked. How do you screw up French fries?? Our server was nice and bubbly and apologetic over the spaghetti and sauce. So horrible I couldn't eat one bite. They did take it off the bill.  Won't be back."}
