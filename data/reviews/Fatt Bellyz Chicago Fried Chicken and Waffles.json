{"text":"This is what im going to say: My first time there i ate there twice in one day! If your from Gary or the Chi.. You will not be let down!  Mild sause .. Pizza puffs.. Chicken with Mild Sause is comparable to Harolds or Sharks chicken.. The owner is super down to earth you will think you back home off Stoney ..lol.. Definitely a recommendation . They open at noon close at midnight! Can't beat that.."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday afternoon right as they opened up. I ordered the pizza puff that came with fries for my son and the jerk chicken salad for myself. The salad was amazing! I've honestly never tasted jerk chicken with so much flavor. It was delicious! I have to go back soon to order the jerk chicken tacos. I am also looking forward to getting myself sum chicken wings with mild sauce. And eventually trying the waffles as well. The pizza puff tasted no different than any other that I've always had.  The only thing that sucked was there wasn't any Ice for the free punch that they offer ...... Or that their soda machine was out of commission. But that still didn't take away from how delicious the food was. I am glad that I got to go there and eat. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant belongs on the no longer running \"Kitchen Nightmares\" show. I walked in the building and was thrown off with the whole setup. They have a weekday special sign that I didn't realize even existed until I already completed my order because it was in a discreet location in the back corner of the restaurant. Next, I place my order at 12:07pm exactly and received my food at 12:45pm. During the wait time, I was also introduced to a smell that smelt like someone just took a fresh crap up in the kitchen. I also got scared when it had been 30 minutes and not a soul had walked in here. When picking up the food, I opened up the box to verify what I've received and it looked really good at face value.. But the taste was absolutely horrid. Literally, if this food is Chicago style, I don't ever want to travel there. Good lawd. If you like slimy waffles and undercooked chicken then this place will be your haven. I haven't even mentioned the service.. Basically for brevities sake, an argument between the employees ensued regarding plastic ware.

Overall experience and taste, I'm giving this place a decent to strong 2 out of 10.

Ya'll know this is just my experience, right?"}
{"text":"We could not find them and there was not a phone number to call them at. I believe they are closed and or have moved and I just think the Yelp page should be updated. I believe they used to be just east of the Sprouts in the strip mall and it is now Gyro's."}
{"text":"Been living in Arizona since 2002 and this is the first place that really taste exactly like Chicago food! The chicken was great! The pizza puffs are awesome! And the Mild Sauce tops everything off! We will definitely keep going back! Atmosphere incredible! I felt like I was back home! Midwest!!"}
{"text":"Food was not all that. Im from the midwest and this place should be ashamed of  comparing itself to Uncle Remus. Shady looking spot, took 30 minutes to get food. Wont waste my time or money there again."}
{"text":"Just left Fatt Bellyz to eat and meet the owner Angelo and his wife. I spent more time conversing with them than actually eating (partly because the chicken dinner was so good that I crushed the food in like 2 minutes).

But it was just a pleasure to sit down with the owner and meet the family, get to know a little about his ups and downs with business since opening in February, and just talk about life in general and making the transition to Phoenix from our respective hometowns.

Although the food is delicious, I'm also supporting based on his spirit, drive, and focus to be great and get better! 

Hopefully this post will encourage and motivate others to do the same"}
{"text":"The wings and boneless breast was amazing. The waffle was fluffy and delicious. The hot sauce was very tasty. I will return. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was drink selection could use some help and the chicken tenders weren't as juicy as the breast, but overall I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"So, I found this place a few weeks ago and have been back a bunch of times.  The food is amazing!  I have never had chicken strips that tasted that good, been that moist, and still crispy.  Im just blown away.  

They are also serving the chicken with a Chicago mild sauce.  It confuses me.  It's hot sauce, but its a bit sweet, a bit tangy, and perfect.  I use it on everything there.  The chicken, the fries, and even the waffles.

Went back the other day for more.  They are still working hard on the location, new pop machine here, a minor closing for new equipment there, so go check these guys out.  It's only getting better every day."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken Tacos ever!!... Like they say never ever trust a skinny cook... the owner puts it down in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Walking up to the door noticed ALL the windows were dirty, no big deal. Once Inside noticed several people sitting at tables with no food. Waited shortly at the counter and couldn't hear anyone talking or cooking. Shabby door hitting the refrigerator, looked haphazard. Honestly the place was dirty, immediately left. Went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brand new spot just opened (next to Sprouts) offering Chicago style chicken and more. If you're like me you've probably been waiting YEARSSSS for an authentic restaurant to open and Fatt Bellyz delivers, Wings, 1/2 chicken, Pizza Puffs, Gyros burgers you name it, is here..but that's not the best part of the place they have *wait for it* 


MILD SAUCE...not ketchup, not bbq sauce, not mumbo sauce..real chi-town style mild sauce.

My order: \"LEMME GET 6 WINGS FRIED HARD, SALT, PEPPER AND EXTRA MILD SAUCE ON MY WINGS AND FRIES\" this is how it's done back home.

The verdict  omgggg taste just like home, wings fried just right, sauce on point..I seriously had to stop myself from overeating..please keep in mind this isn't your usual Wingstop or ATL wing dings..those 6 wings are 6 FULL 2-section wings.

They close at midnight Mon - Wed and 3am Thurs - Sat....MAKE YOUR WAY TO THIS SPOT.

The owners were so hospitable and treated everyone that walked in like family. I'll definitely be back - hope to see you there."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. We drive all the way from Gilbert to eat here. Their jerk chicken and jerk steak tacos are the best tacos I've had in AZ hand down. The chicken wings and mild sauce
Never miss a beat and the pizza pockets are delicious. There will be a bit of a wait because everything is cooked/made to order so it's best to call ahead or use Uber eats and have it delivered to you."}
{"text":"Went in today to check it out. Ordered a 1/2 White with waffle. It's two chicken wings and two boneless chicken breasts with a single waffle. It took quite a while to get our food, which the lady at the counter apologized for, but I didn't mind. If the chicken is being made on the spot, it's going to take awhile. You generally can't fry up chicken in 5 minutes. As for the food itself, the waffle was really good. It was cakey and light and had a good flavor. The chicken was pretty good too, though one breast was perfect and the other was very tough. I've had that happen with chicken I've bought from the store, so I don't blame the establishment. Wouldn't mind going back and trying a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big chicken and waffle guy, so I came here strictly to try that. I was not disappointed. I ordered the half chicken and waffles and it was HUGE. Probably enough food for two people, but momma didn't raise no chump so I wolfed it down myself. The chicken was juicy and the waffle was cooked perfectly. 

The food does take a while, but it is made to order and frying chicken doesn't take two minutes, so be patient. The owners are extremely accommodating and even gave my friends and I the remote for one of the TVs while we waited. Only downside would be they need a bit more advertising or something that 'pops' from the outside. Its a hard task finding the place from the outside since it is very plain and took me about 5 minutes to do so.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great wings. Could have been seasoned a bit heavier, but great overall. Mild sauce - amazing!  Pizza pocket was delicious as well. I only gave 3 stars because 1) The waffles tasted like boxed batter that wasn't mixed properly. Next time I'll get fries. 2)The fountain machine wasn't working or set up or something so we were forced to buy expensive bottled sodas. 3) The grease was overdue for a change. You could see it in the way the chicken was fried & unfortunately taste it on the chicken. :o( and 4)The food took foooor eveeeer. Though they did keep updating us on the status and apologizing. I appreciated their being aware of that. 

As of now we'll definitely be back. They are new enough that I know they will be able to get these kinks worked out if they pay attention to these reviews and adjust accordingly."}
{"text":"Great food. Great family, service was slow but the food makes up for it. The place was alright,  time to receive food is longer than most place. It a short list of chicken spots around and far the best. Also that mild sauce is amazing."}
