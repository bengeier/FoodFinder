{"text":"Great & reasonable  $ sandwiches.  Checkout the new outdoor patio.

Had the shrimp posted boy - enough for two to split - only  $8 bucks."}
{"text":"Addicted to the Shrimp Po Boy! As a sandwich enthusiast I give Sullys Sandwiches a glowing recommendation. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful, the Po Boy alone is composed of a perfect combination of texture: crunchy shrimp tempura, delicious southern slaw and a creamy aioli to set off the tempura, complete with a perfect bun. Will be returning as often as possible!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the bun alone, it's perfect.

The skirt steak sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it was open; it's closed because there was a structural problem with the building apparently. They're going to be opening a new location downtown at some point. Sad for me because this one was right at my doorstep. Great people and great food. If they re-open, the Shrimp Po-Boy, Porchetta and Chicken were all favourites, but I was never disappointed with anything I tried."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp po boy. It was better than the one I had in New Orleans! Super friendly staff too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing tofu sandwich with an asian twist. Would have wanted it slightly bigger for the price but overall a must try sandwich shop. Flavors were excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome...simply awesome! It so great to go to a place where the take their craft seriously. Even better when the finished product is stellar! I had the porchetta sandwich and certainly ranks as best in the city. The crackling shines in this awesome Mexican inspired rendition of this classic sandwich. The people beside were raving about the steak and shrimp po' boy sandwiches. I can't wait to try those next time. 

Also, the staff was super friendly and the place just oozes cool. I'll be a regular for sure!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this charming hole in the wall on the way to dim sum. Fabulous. Shrimp po boy was unbelievably good. Excellent fries. Prices are too low!"}
{"text":"This place would appeal most to the MacDonald's generation. Based on the rave reviews I would say the MacDonald's crowed has found it. Giving away free hot chocolate daily is a good indication of their need for business. The Brick Oven Bakery on Logan at Queen still holds the title for best Leslieville Sandwich at only $7.50. tax included. They are also working the marketing angle and have every friend write a positive review.  Been here a few times since my first review below and I am not as hot about this place as previous.  Sully's started off good but they seem to keep dropping the ball. The giant mirror (what were they thinking) has got to go. Imagine eating a messy sandwich while looking at yourself in a giant mirror 3 feet away, not pretty. I notice now people sit with their back to the mirror starring at the wall.

You won't get a nicer bunch of servers but that's just not good enough. This is a tiny sandwich place so grab and go is important. I waited over 30 minutes for my sandwich, it was obvious my order got pushed back for some unorganized reason. I'm not impressed and not happy. If they get your order right, it could be enjoyable, they don't, usually they drop the ball. 

The shrimp sandwich is sully's version of a New Orleans classic sandwich. Not eve close to the real thing but tasty. I wouldn't go back

Definitely not a winning formula. I would recommend to only go during off hours, only problem is, they have very restricted hours making it a place you cannot rely on."}
{"text":"I work in the neighborhood and decided to pop in for lunch today having heard good things. I was not disappointed! The guy behind the counter recommended the porchetta sandwich. I brought it back to work to eat and it was fantastic. Great value for the price, the sandwich was loaded up. The meat was rich and flavourful and toppings are a roasted jalape√±o and queso fresco which gives it just the right amount of spice and texture. There was also cracking which I could have used a bit more of to give it a little more crunch! My only complaint would be that the bun got a bit soggy on the walk back to the office, so it was a bit messy to eat. Next time I might ask them to cut it in half for me to make it easier. Otherwise completely spot on, I will definitely be back to try some of the other items here!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches.

I tried 2 different kinds the Po boy and it was fantastic, shrimp was fried perfectly. And the Porchetta, this was good but was lacking the crunch of some cracklin, if they added that it would have been perfect.

Overall though, this place is worth going to."}
{"text":"Wowww best sandwiches I've had in a longg time!! 
Had the Porchetta (which was soft and fatty and delicious) and the Shrimp Po Boy (crispy and saucy). Both were amazing, really. The bread they use is perfect because it soaks up the sauce without getting soggy. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Sully's popped up quietly like a hip ninja on the quiet-but-slowly-blooming-if-ever Gerrard/Logan dead storefronts stretch that I walk by every single day back in my high school days. To some, it's a welcomed addition to the area. For others it's just a place for great gourmet sandwiches, run by a guy who also runs a downtown hotel restaurant and is apparently dead serious about quality \"consciously crafted food\" and sandwich-making as a skill.

The establishment itself is small, with a bar height table seating six and barely any more room for a lineup.** The decor seems at an inexplicable crossroads between bare bones basics (with a depressingly empty shelf on one wall) and cliche hipster reclaimed wood aesthetics from the hip down (trying to be inspired by shipbuilding with them rope details?).

I'm not as big about sandwiches as owner Michael 'Sully' may be, but you know what? They make some pretty decent sandwiches. They have a tiny and straightfoward menu, with sandwiches including a meatless Banh mi-style option on board. The $8 porchetta sandwich is a delicious conservative choice, packing a good mix of juicy pork, crunchiness and a kick of heat from the jalapeno aioli every second or third bite. The steak ($8) however, now that's a big mouthful of fun in a handful. It comes with fries... in the sandwich; it's a takeout meal slapped in between two buns! Oh yes, them buns they use: slightly crispy, very soft, holds everything in place without getting soggy quickly, and definitely the perfect bread for any sandwich you'll want to eat. Go to hell, Wonder bread!

There's one minor inconvenience though. They do have a habit of being closed inexplicably when they say they would be open--their hours of 11 to 1800h are not posted anywhere in the window but rather appears on their Twitter account (@sullyssandwich - they apparently too kool for a webz site or even hours on the window). I guess the most reliable indicator is to see if the lights are on and their sandwich board is out listing their off-menu daily specials. And they definitely don't open on Sundays.

Also, only soft drinks served. You want beer like a true hipsta (like they sometimes suggest on their Twitter feed)? You could go across the street to the Beer Store, score a can, sit at the curb and kick it real old school Leslieville/South Riverdale. Just sayin'.

**edit addendum May 2015: they installed two picnic tables out front, effectively more than doubling their on-site eat-in capacity. Yea.

{TTC: 506 streetcar to Logan Ave. No sandwich sign out for a sandwich shop, no open lah.}"}
{"text":"A hidden gem fo' sho'! 

I had the Shrimp Po' Boy (tempura shrimp, southern slaw, romaine, tomato & creole aioli, $8) but all the sandwiches sounded appealing. Definitely the best sandwich I've had in recent memory and that's saying a lot as I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches in general. 

I was torn between the sandwich I had and the porchetta sandwich (roasted poblano, pickled red onion, queso fresco, tomatillo, lime and jalepeno aioli). There was also a steak sandwich that seemed to be a popular choice.

The sandwich was HUGE but not too heavy thanks to the pillowy bun. I did find it filling but mostly because it was huge and because I scarfed that sucker down like Kobayashi in competition. The tempura coating on the shrimp was nice and crisp and the shrimp themselves not overcooked. The textures of the sandwich held up surprisingly well considering I got the sandwich to go - it did not become soggy during the 10 minute trip home.

Can't wait to visit Sully's again to try some of the other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This little sandwich outpost just east of Gerrard strip of Chinatown East was on my radar for a long time.  But everytime I swung by, I was either not hungry or the place was closed (open til 6pm, closed Sundays).

Now, I'm always wary of hyped-up, trendy, pricey sandwich joints that claim higher quality but always lack that 'oomph' and leave you unsatisfied in portion size and flavour.  However, I had hope for this place considering the relatively odd location and odd hours (let's face it, if it's open all hours in a busy part of town -- it doesn't need to be good).  And I'm glad to report this place is legit.

Service is friendly and I was recommended to try either the shrimp po' boy or the porchetta for a first-timer.  I decided on the po' boy and it was godamned delicious.  It was loaded with large tempura-fried fresh shrimp and all the ingredients (romaine, slaw, tomato, and a light aioli with a light kick) complemented the shrimp and didn't overpower it.  In addition, I find most sandwich joints use shitty bread -- not here.  Just right the thickness and texture and the sandwich was built beautifully for no 'dry bites'.  A steal for $8.

I had a bite of the Meatless (tempura battered and marinated tofu, sesame mustard and Asian slaw) and it was decent - perhaps a bit salty and lacked texture - but my vegetarian girlfriend really liked it (she usually has to settle for 'after thought' veggie options) as it had protein and the flavour was well layered.  And ya, DAT BUN again - so good.

The place doesn't reinvent the sandwich - but crafted everything just right.  I actually found myself thinking about the delicious po' boy hours after having it (doing our weekend shop in Chinatown).  Now, that's fucking impressive.

The place may take the 'consciously crafted' label a bit too seriously - no pop on offer, just Pellegrino and flat/sparkling water.  But service was friendly and the sandwiches do all the talking.  Also, there is a shelf of random table games and toys to keep yourself entertained while you wait for your sandwich to be constructed.

Will definitely be back to try the porchetta - will hold off on the full-bird five stars to make sure it wasn't a fluke - but ya, I really like this simple sandwich joint."}
{"text":"The place has a great feel the moment you walk in. Even as a first timer, they treated me as if they knew me. 
Simple menu, packed with flavorful options. I had chicken, bf had shrimp sandwich. The sauce in the shrimp sandwich was unreal! The fries were delicious too :)"}
{"text":"Okay, yes. Perfection. Why aren't there more places like this? All a starving bitch wants once in a while is a well priced sandwich that isn't from Subway that you can eat in without feeling awkward or take out like a bandit and scarf down in the car, making humming sounds while chewing.

My stupidity here was that I read about this place back in January during the Polar Vortex Redux and super excited to try the place, I drove over, parked the car around the corner and whipped in to get the po boy which was the star of all the reviews, except it wasn't on the menu...wtf? \"There's no po boy,\" said the girl adamantly. I argued to no avail: \"IT'S IN ALL THE REVIEWS, ARE YOU SURE?\" she shrugged  and I ordered a sandwich, any sandwich, I don't fucking remember what was in it but it went in my mouth and eventually out the other end without fanfare. I ate in, with a bunch of Riverdale ageing saggy titted hipster types, drinking coffee while their dander had formed stucco patterns on the walls, I was suspicious something was wrong...THEN! When I left the place, bundling myself back up in my goddamn feather shedding parka that I've since burned, I looked to the east and saw the Sully's sandwich board two doors over and I  realized I WAS IN THE WRONG FUCKN SANDWICH SHOP. I was so mad that I filled myself up with another sandwich without my intent that I blocked the whole thing out of my mind and went home and watched a bunch of Netflix for 6 months.

It was like I banged some dumbass roadie instead of the rockstar.

Anyway, I remembered yesterday while driving along Gerrard. Must try Sully's, the reminder app in my brain tweeted. Parked in front of the joint so I wouldn't get confused again and ordered the po' boy AND the fries and sat inside. Great service (so cute were the guys), sandwich is HUGE, the battered shrimp is succulent and the slaw inside is fresh and crunchy, the bun is fluffy and fresh with NO sesame seeds! (please all sandwich joints need to stop with sesame seed buns, those little seeds ruin everything)...the fries are skinny French frite type, very elegant. So happy it's warm out now because there is a patio.

I will come back and try every sandwich except for the tofu one, because no."}
