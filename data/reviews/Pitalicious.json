{"text":"I have not had a worst pita wrap ever. I ordered a lamb pita wrap. The meat stank and tasted awful. Needless to say it looked more like a sloppy joe then a pita wrap. Ended up throwing it away and running to Tims just to change the taste in my mouth. Not going back thats for sure."}
{"text":"Don't go here! Seriously, it's busy enough without you.
Do not go here if you aren't interested in generous servings of bold flavoured food.
This family run restaurant isn't for you.

I usually get the shwarma platter. It's $14 plus tax, but I end up getting 2 delicious lunches out of it. The salad and tabouleh, assorted pickles, chicken and various sauces and hummus go into the warm grilled pita for lunch one. That leaves a generous amount of potatoes, rice, chicken and hot sauce for day 2 lunch.

I can't say enough good things about the whole food experience here. I love it.

The only negative I've experienced is the parking. As others have noted, this lot is very crowded and a bit insane."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for lunch and I keep coming back because the food here is excellent and consistent.  The service is amazing and they are all super nice.  It appears to be a family run business. The place is clean and very welcoming!  It's located in an odd building which houses automotive mechanical businesses but do not let this turn you away.

My go to lunch meal is the Falafel sandwich.  The falafel is always freshly cooked upon order but don't be afraid as it is rather quick.  The falafel has to be one of the best I've had in the GTA.  It's fresh, tastes great, and has the perfect amount of crunch/crisp to it.  All their ingredients are fresh taste excellent.  I've also ordered their Beef Shawarma plate which again was excellent.  The chef who assembles your meal, whether it be your sandwich or dinner meal is very generous.

My only complaint would be the long line ups at lunch as many people in the area come here for their lunch break.  However, considering the service and excellent food the line up is a given.  

*Tip - Get the daily made lemonade, especially on a hot summer day. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in GTA? No. Great people n great food? ABSOLUTELY. First time here & I am a believer. Would def come back. Their chicken shawarma platter is filled with chicken, yellow rice, potatoes, taboul√©, pickles, hummus n garlic sauce! Oh yeah i almost forgot that it also comes with side of pita. Real good value for around $12. The only negative i would say that i ordered yogourt drink n it was not good - it was actually expired for 2 weeks. My suggestion is to leave the yogourt drink n just drink water. Aside from this minor hiccup i would recommend this place if u live on north east end of city. 


Bon appetit"}
{"text":"At first glance, you're probably going to think that you can chow down on a couple of their Shawarma sandwiches. Little did I know how densely packed these suckers were. They are definitely tasty and a unique look when you compare them  to your typical Shawarma. I started going here less than a year, and have been back frequently. Definitely one of the best in the north-eastern part of the GTA.

Regarding the owners, they seem like some of the sweetest people, and found that they have always been accommodating when it comes to customization and substitutions."}
{"text":"Location is not exactly the best spot. However, the business is a family-run business and their chicken shawarmas are amazing. Also their home-made lemonade is to die for. Price is very good. Only down side is that they close early."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best shawarma in Markham, maybe even the GTA. This place never disappoints. Monday-Friday at lunch time there's a lineup out the door and for good reason. I keep it simple and stick to the mixed shawarma. Do yourself a favour and have lunch here!"}
{"text":"Shawarma Empire snob here....

Ever since finding Empire, I turn my nose up to a lot of shawarma places; most places are either unauthentic (tzadziki instead of tahini?!!!), the meat is cooked poorly, or it is too expensive. While Pitalicious isn't quite the taste (or bargain) that I have come to enjoy down at Lawrence and Pharmacy, it is the perfect place for someone who works in Markham and just wants some decent middle-eastern food for lunch.

Came in after debating it for a long while (something about the business name made me think it would be a gimmicky place, watered down in order to appeal to \"gentler palates\" - not so), propelled by the positive reviews here on yelp. I was impressed with both the food and the service; the meat was being cooked freshly, toppings were fresh, there was a selection of sides and desserts at the counter, and a large dispenser of homemade lemonade with fresh mint sat nice and cold near the cash. 

Service

Everyone in Pitalicious is family, mom on cash, dad on food, and daughter supporting the two simultaneously. Service is friendly and helpful; everyone was more than willing to explain the dishes to me, and to chat a little bit about food and culture in general. Growing up half-Armenian, a lot of the dishes were similar/familiar to my family's, but with a some different spicing. 

Food

What I've had so far:

Chicken Shawarma,
Chicken Shawarma dinner w/ mujadeen (rice & lentils with fried onions)
Dolma (grape leaves)
Baklava (cigar & traditional)
Lemonade

The chicken is great, crispy edges and not overcooked; haven't tried the beef (looks a little dry) and lamb isn't my thing. Really liked the mujadeen; the rice, as well as the meat and sauce, all have spicing in it that makes me think along the lines of cinnamon, or allspice....something more African? What's really interesting (and unique for me) are the array of toppings: aside from the standards (sumac onion, lettuce, cucumber, pickles, turnip), sandwiches are stuffed with tabouleh, cabbage slaw, hummus, a THICK garlic sauce, and topped with a hot pepper.

The baklava are really good. They have three varieties: traditional (triangle wedge), cigar (rolled), and a four-cornered one. Just need to try the last one.

LEMONADE! This lemonade is ridiculously good, made fresh, and the fresh mint really adds a dimension of flavour that makes it unique.

All in all, this is a great spot for lunch, and a better alternative to Wendy's, South St, Tucker's, Swiss Chalet, and everything else around here."}
{"text":"Amazing quality and service! Let me start with the one unfortunate aspect; parking. The lot is tiny, difficult to spot from the road and around lunch time basically impossible to get a spot. And being in the industrial part of Markham on woodbine you pretty much have to drive.

That being said if there were 6 stars i'd give it to them. The owners are honestly some of the nicest people I've ever met and they are very accommodating. Suffice to say the service is top notch. 

Then there's the food. Oooh man it's good! The meat is never dry or oily, it' well spiced and really carries the other flavours nicely! The baklawa is delicious with a pistachio/walnut filling and i think a cinnamon/honey glaze. But it's still not the best part, which is the lemonade. Seriously just try it!

All in all 5/5 for these guys they rock!"}
{"text":"Number one shwarma place in G T A. Sweet and citrus lemonade is a no match. Decent prices and great service. Since this place is in a industrial area parking can be a bit of a problem during lunch time so plan lunch hour accordingly  best time to go is after 1:30ish."}
{"text":"Very authentic middle eastern food. Very clean, friendly and tasteful restaurant. The chicken shwarma pita is outstanding!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best falafel sandwich in the city! Like others have said there is no parking and it is insanely busy from noon to 1pm. But it's worth the trouble.

They make the falafel fresh per order. Takes 10 minutes for them to deep fry and totally delicious. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy inside. The garnishes are fresh and the owner stuffs the pita absolutely full. 

Order the homemade lemonade to drink, it's so good! Best $10 lunch in Markham for sure. The owner, his wife and daughter are very nice and no matter how busy, they always seem to be smiling."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I can certainly understand the hype. This is a really popular place. The line was about 12-deep when I got in and the parking lot was chaos. I ended up parking alongside a fence where there actually aren't parking spots. Four other cars were doing likewise so the parking is definitely a problem. There was even some double-parking going on.

I ordered the chicken shawarma pita and a lemonade. I got everything on the chicken pita and it was pretty tasty. They do fill the pocket and keep it pocket shaped rather than roll it. I would say this isn't my favourite chicken shawarma ever, but it was pretty darn good. 

It tasted primarily of tahini (really toasted tahini) and that flavour did overpower the other flavours (even the chicken was overshadowed). I definitely couldn't taste the hot sauce that was put on it. Next time I would ask for extra hot sauce and little or no tahini. I really loved that they put tabouli on their pitas. Not a lot of places do.

The lemonade was good, but again, not my favourite lemonade. It had a good balance of lemon and sugar. Some places make their lemonade too sweet. I simply prefer my lemonade a bit more tart."}
{"text":"A coworker and I are staying in Toronto, and decided to pass by for lunch. We were looking for something quick and tasty! Walking in, it doesnt seem like the fanciest of all places but it has a very \"home-ish\" atmosphere. The lady at the counter and the guy (with the big mustache- which might actually be the owner) serving were SUPER NICE!!!!!! My coworker and I are super picky (Yay! Another picky person on my team!!) and he wanted us to try everything but not in pushy way, he just mentioned that he loved food and wanted everyone to try the deliciousness. Awww how cute is he!!!

Pita bread is always good and the saffron rice was very tasty! The chicken kebab wasnt my favorite, ummm some parts of it were too burnt, so all i tasted was just burnt chicken. I want to go back and try the beef shwarma, from up close it looked amazing."}
{"text":"Easily the best shawarma I've had in the GTA. I grew up in the middle east and  always complained that there is no good authentic shawarma/falafel places in Toronto. This one was a pleasant surprise. 
They use proper pitas which they heat up and stuff the pocket (not like the cheating giant thin pitas which are just used as wraps in so many places). I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and the chicken was not dry at all, all the toppings were delicious as well. 
I saw them make the falafel balls right on the spot from scratch rather than re-frying already mixed and frozen falafel, so gotta give them props for that as well. Will definitely have to go back to try the falafel sandwich next time. 

The lineup at lunchtime was out the door so it took a while to order, but after getting the food I could see why they're so busy. Plus despite being so busy the service was friendly. They also had fresh Middle Eastern style lemonade, with mint."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time not realizing it's a GEM! It's nestled in some grungy looking building shared with auto-repair shops, so it doesn't look like much as you're driving down Woodbine Ave, and parking is super limited especially during the lunch hour. But if you manage to step inside you will see it's a very clean, well decorated, and cozy little place (can seat probably 20-ish people), and the warm aroma of Shawarma will greet you. The staff are friendly, I mean really nice. Even the big gruff looking guy doing the cooking, he's a gentle soul, a charming gentleman. 

Okay, so how's the food?

1. Well priced ($9 taxes in for a Shawarma pita)
2. Well varied (All your typical favourites and toppings)
3. Well portioned (Don't let the sight deceive you, the meal was very filling!)
4. Well eaten (Very tasty. Ingredients very fresh and flavourful)

I'm just annoyed at myself for not coming here sooner. I drive by here EVERY SINGLE DAY!

Pitalicious will now be one of my regular lunch locations during the work week. Well done."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Some of the best lemonade and baklawa I've ever had. The owners are so friendly and always make you feel right at home. All in all,  5/5."}
{"text":"Not going to say too much other than the fact the clowns who run this joint need a good old fashion lesson on proper customer etiquette and client interaction. Very rude owners with no sense of how to handle a customer issue. Was the primary reason why I stopped going there. Food got kind of stale after a while. Suffered from that same-old-same syndrome."}
{"text":"Ever since osmows in mississauga started disappointing me this has become my favorite shawarma in the GTA.  No matter now busy the cashier is she is always extremely friendly and same goes for the chef,  always give you a happy hello and goodbye. 

As for the shawarma...  It's delicious,  soo much flavor,  never dry. I live the whole hot peppers they put in,  they are a bit complicated to eat since you have to remove the stems but totally worth it. 

Very nice decor great food and great service. A must visit when in markham."}
{"text":"If you work around this area like I do, there aren't a lot of options for cheap, fast lunch that's not Asian food. Not knocking Asian food, but I eat that at home 'all' the time. So in that sense, Pitalicious, along with Bamiyan Kebob, offers decent Middle Eastern option in this area.

I usually get the beef/chicken shawarma wrap. It's great."}
{"text":"Found this business on Yelp, searching for food nearby my office that isnt Mcdonalds, Subway or some other chain - and happy I found it!

Coworker and I went here last week.  I had a shish tawook pita and she had a shawarma pita. These pitas were LOADED. Toppings were literally exploding out of the pita. 

We got take-out and all the juices inside the pita leaked through the paper take-out bag.. I was starving and was eating what I could as I was driving.. meanwhile  juices were leaking all over me, my pants, my vehicle, down the hallway at work --- and I don't even care because it was so worth it. 

Definitely going to come back here, super friendly staff, fresh food and down the street from work. Winning.

* ask for extra napkins for take-out. Just saying.
* giving 4 stars because I want to visit again to try more items~"}
{"text":"Easily the BEST shawarma in Markham. Nevermind that Markham is like a shawarma wasteland and that there are barely any places here to begin with, this was a very solid shawarma. 

When I saw that the shawarma here were stuffed instead of rolled I knew I had stumbled onto somewhere good. The chicken shawarma was full of chicken which wasn't dry or burnt or pre cut and sitting and at the bottom of the spit for who knows how long like so many other places, but was nice and moist and there was a good selection of toppings too including pickled turnips and the not always present hot peppers.

Falafels looked like they were fried to order so +1 for that too.

I've been waiting for a good shawarma place to open up in Markham for a loooong time so needless to say I'll be coming back and that I can finally sleep well at night knowing I can get a decent shawarma without driving somewhere obscenely far."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. Good prices, family run . I asked for a old fashioned spoon and I got one. Will come back if I'm in the area next time"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a hidden gem. Tucked away in an unassuming plaza off Woodbine ave. in Markham this place on the exterior seems like just another pita joint dishing up subway renditions in wrap form. But alas as the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover. In reality, this place is serving up Middle Eastern takeout classics like shawarma, falafel, lentil soup etc. 

Knowing that this place gets a crazy lunch rush during the week, I opted to come in on a Saturday afternoon. Without the crowds from nearby businesses coming in for lunch the place was empty. I ordered a chicken shawarma and a small bowl of lentil soup. From the moment I walked in I knew that this place was the real deal. The smell in the air was of aromatic Middle Eastern spices, the topping bar contained all the traditional toppings like pickled turnip and the moustachioed gentlemen (the owner) was jovial and oozed loving hospitality. 

My shawarma was excellent, one of the better ones I have had in Toronto. My pita pocket was stuffed with a generous portion of chicken which was crispy, flavourful but not dry. The topping were layered perfectly so that every bite of the shawarma contained flavours from each topping. I never once got a mouthful without several toppings or chicken. Shafiq the owner is a true master of shawarma architecture. The real winner of the sandwich was the sauces. I opted for tahini and garlic sauce. The tahini was tangy and creamy, which complimented the chicken well. The garlic sauce, MY GOD! It was so thick, with chunks of garlic, that it could not be squeezed out of a bottle; rather it is spread on your sandwich with a knife. This sauce is clearly made in house and truly packs a punch, it is very potent but oh so delicious. 

My lentil soup was also delicious. A homemade soup, with a thicker consistency it was nicely spiced with cumin. Be sure to add a squeeze of lemon as this will take it over the top. On a cold day, this soup is comforting, not to mention very healthy and filling. 

The place itself is a mostly take out joint but they do have some tables to sit and eat. I spoke a bit with the owner and it is clear that he is passionate about what he does. Everything is made in house, and he is certainly proud of that. Prices are on par with other pita places (i.e. 6-7 dollars), however they only have Middle Eastern food here, don't be fooled by the name. If you live or works anywhere near this place it should become a lunch staple for you."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent Chicken Shwarma sandwich.  And in a real hefty pita (not a thin one or a wrap).  The lemonade (with mint and hunks of lemon floating in it) was awesome as well. Great hummus also.  Excellent rice. Tasty freshcut fries.  All around, really awesome and not too expensive ($7.50 sandwich, $12 plate).  And the folks running things were really friendly."}
{"text":"Classsic Shawarma fare.... good quality. Gets busy at lunch mon to fri.
There's not too many decent shawarma places around here."}
{"text":"Every time i go to pitalicious I am greeted with a warm smile! Their family feel and quick service brings me back time and time again. The way they season their shawarma keeps its flavourful and fresh. My co workers LOVE the hand made falafel and home made hot sauce. 

Pitalicious will be a lunch time staple for years to come."}
{"text":"Best place in this neighborhood to get a decent meal and not spend too much either. Either Shawarmas are great and a must try, so is the home-made lemonade, when available."}
{"text":"Best lunch option in this part of Markham!  Toppings are fresh and generous.  I've been here almost every week since I discovered it through yelp, sometimes twice.  The mixed shawerma is my go-to, but their falafel is just as good if you need the veg option.  Be prepared for a long line if you're here between noon and 1, but I just heard they take phone orders.  As long as I'm working in this area I'll always be coming back!"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter, you'd be greeted by a glorious mustache in chefs attire.

The place is busy during lunch hours as a lot of people come for take away. 
I haven't had many shawarmas in GTA(have had them in middle east), but i can say by far this was the best shawarma I have had here.

I have a big appetite so i thought one shawarma won't fill me up, but boy was a I wrong, their shawarma appears smaller because they don't roll it, but it is filled with goodness and one is enough to fill me up, they also put more meat than other shawarma shops.

Also, they have really good lemonade and turkish coffee, I actually came across a certificate in their shop which said \"Best Lemonade in Markham\" presented by somebody.

So, if you are going there, have yourself a shawarma and a lemonade and you will be good to go.

P.S they don't advertise it, but i confirmed with the restaurant that their stuff is halal."}
{"text":"Mustachio'd man serves up the best goddamn Arab street eats. 

Garlic Sawse. Enough said."}
{"text":"I put on a seminar for 21 persons last week and thought I would order lunch for the group. I called up and they suggested the lunch platter and agreed to deliver it around noon. I agreed but they couldn't give me a firm price on the phone but said they would call back. The food arrived and there was enough for around 50 people and the bill came out to $370. This is about half what I have normally payed for groups of 20 people

We all ate less that half of the food and much of it went home with different attendees. It seems that they are not to be trusted and I certainly won't order from them again."}
{"text":"First, the location is not great. You can basically only get there by driving and it's beside a collision center so the parking spots are full of damaged cars. Also it's on the east side of Woodbine so heading toward the highway you have to make a left into their parking lot.

From the outside the restaurant looks a little tacky and dated but once you walk in you'll see it's a beautifully clean and industrial kitchen. There are plenty of seating and nicely furnished. A wide screen plays wheel of fortune during lunch too.

This is a mom and pop restaurant and you can tell they take pride in their product by the quality of their food. Their logo is a younger version of the pop, he now has a grey mustache but at least you won't be disappointed to not see a stache. Both mom and pop are very nice and friendly.

I tried their Shish Kabob plate which comes with decent saffron rice, 2 pieces of potatoes in a sour marinade, roasted peppers, salad, a pita and the kabob. It also comes with tahini, garlic paste, lots of pickled turnip, and I believe 2 poblano(?) peppers which were a great addition! 

All this sounds like a lot of food and holy crap it was! I BMOT(brought my own tupperware) and they stuffed the thing. The food was knocking on the cover begging to come out. My container is 5\"x8\"x2\". It was enough for lunch and dinner. 

All the flavours were there, great mixture of savory and sour. The spiciness was perfect for me. The lamb was a little tough so maybe I'll try shawarma next time. Which looked REALLY good on the spit. I'm really satisfied with the meal!

For my brick of food it was $12 and change.

My new go-to pita place in my home town."}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma place in the GTA. Fresh ingredients and a friendly, family run business keeps me coming back for more. Avoid the rush at lunch by going around 1pm or you may have a hard time finding parking.  Oh, and best lemonade in the city hands down."}
{"text":"Popped into this place for lunch after my girlfriend had spotted in while driving by. 

Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised that it was a shawarma place. My office is at warden and Denison and there are no good shawarma places nearby. 

Husband and wife team behind the counter, which excites me knowing that the food is going to be authentic. 

Ordered the mixed shawarma platter and a side of falafels. I was sharing with the misses. Place came absolutely packed with rice, different kinds of salads and meat! The food was really flavourful and the falafels - they are right up their with Sababa and Tov Li. 

All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Really good mixed Shawarma sandwich!! It looks small but packed with goodness and very filing. Their lemonade was also very refreshing and goes well with the Sammy. 

Very busy at lunch, I went at 11:30 and it was difficult to find parking as well a line had already formed. A good sign of good food."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be a franchise type place from the name.  Clean place, the staff were very friendly and the shawarma I got was just stuffed and tasted amazing.  Only drawback to the place is it's packed at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Their Shawarma is good, environment is OK, and if you are looking for a local place to have a lunch during workdays, I strongly suggest this place. The only issue is it is not easy to find a parking spot beside this place because of all surrounding body shops."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this place! Thank you Yelp yet once again! 

I've been craving shawarma after having it during a recent trip to Montreal. That place was amazing so I hopped online to try to find some in Toronto but most of the places are out of my way. So when I found this place on Yelp, I was curious. 

Honestly, I never noticed this place before. I drive on Woodbine all the time but I never notice this plaza. Their red and yellow sign kind of reminds me of Chinese take out. I don't know why. But anyways eventually found it and went in and found the restaurant empty. That's usually a bad sign but I REALLY wanted shawarma and this is the closest place to me in Markham. That, and the food behind the counter looked REALLY REALLY fresh. 

Their menu consists of shawarmas, shish kebobs, falafel, soup, salad, potatoes, desserts.....  I didn't have a hard time choosing though because I came in here with a sole mission! 

So for $6.50 you can choose from beef, chicken or mix of the two. I decided to get the mix one and thought that the price is a bit higher than the ones you can get on Lawrence... but as the man behind the counter started loading my \"everything\" onto the pita, I soon realize, this is by far superior. 

\"Everything\" comes with garlic mash, hummus, coleslaw, red cabbage, tomato salad, pickled turnip, pickles, and hot pepper. Then you get the white sauce and the hot sauce. I'm sorry but I don't know the names of these toppings so I can best only explain it this way. But the combination is AMAZING. 

As you can tell, my pita was loaded. The pita itself is SOLID. No thin, soggy, limpy stuff here. It was thick and tossed on the grill to be warmed up before the meat and toppings go in. The meat itself was average, the beef a bit dry, the chicken was better more moist but the pieces were cut too small in my opinion even though there was alot. 

I was so very much satisfied and their shawarma is so worth the $6.50 and then some. Definitely a keeper in Markham!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pitalicious Vegetarian combo (~$13) - it comes with 3 pieces of falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, salad, a pita, and some pickles! 

The spreads were all so good and fresh - perfect to dip your pita in. The pita itself however was lackluster, didn't taste that fresh or homemade... but covered in hummus, s'all good still . 

The falafel's taste was perfect, but it wasn't the freshest. This might be because I came at 3pm which is quite close to their closing time around 5. There was also only 3 small balls of falafel and for $13 , I would expect a little bit more though!

I also got their shredded wheat and pistachio dessert (baklava-ish). It was SO YUMMMMMYYY. Not too sweet despite being covered in honey! And filled with delicious pistachio nuts . They had 3 other varieties, other than this shredded wheat one, available too!

They accept credit card here as well."}
{"text":"One of those hidden locations, but worth a try. To my knowledge only shawarma place in the area. Plastics accepted, clean environment, nice seating area. 

Ordered a chicken shawarma, came close to $9. At first glance looks small but its packed. Ordered all the toppings and of course hot sauce. Really good, I still don't get the purpose of the 2 giant peppers but..it was really good. Good flavored chicken, tasted fresh overall. 

Its a bit pricey compared to your run of the mill shawaram store, but the taste makes up for it. Would go again for lunch."}
{"text":"Great stuffed  pitas, excellent chicken; Service was adequate. I will be back for another quick bite!"}
{"text":"I was going to rate this 3 stars, not understanding the hype from all the other reviews. I got the chicken shawarma platter and there wasn't much flavour in the rice or potatoes, chicken was so dry and overcooked, and did not feel warm. However, the service was good and portions were huge. 

Yesterday after eating from here, me and my brother got really bad food poisoning. Worst I've ever had in my life. Usually me and my stomach can handle a little bit but this was so painful. It had to have been really bad for me to get to the point that I was at, and still slightly am. I would not recommend ANYONE eating here.

 If you are ever in Waterloo, ON, make sure you check out Mozy's Shawarma. Best shawarma I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered shawarma on a house salad and received a 1:4 ratio. 

This place makes a good buck from all the suits that walk in during lunch hour, so I get they want profit. But a level of moderation on portion size that leaves the customer  hungry after eating is a miss people. Come on. 

Also found it strange, while standing in line for 25mins, that behind the counter there were 4 employees and only the 'big chief' handled food/served customers. What of the others?"}
{"text":"I was in Markham due to business visit, so my coworkers referred us to this place. I just have one word for this : \"AMAZING!!\"

This family-run business has the best chicken shawarmas ever, you have to get there little bit earlier than the normal lunch hours because this place gets jam-packed. I really love their food so much that we are planning a trip back to Canada just to eat here. the service  is great, the owners are really friendly and unique, always in a good mood.. so you get to have a happy lunch made with love ;)

If you are in Toronto, seriously stop by.. you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Really nice place to grab lunch at. Priced approximately at where the other Shawarma places are, quick service, very tasty. Friendly staff.The food is plentiful and can rival any top shawarma place. I am a fan."}
{"text":"So delicious ! I got the shawarma wrap and although the wrap looks smaller than most places cause they don't roll it. It's actually very filling and extremely delicious. That's all I have to say :)"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this week. From the outside, the place doesn't look like much. It's small, but the food is lovely and the staff very welcoming. I will definitely be making this one of my regular places to eat."}
{"text":"Wonderfully tasty and hand-crafted food ... lunch and dessert, too! Family run business, too - not a chain. I always look forward to lunches there."}
{"text":"This place is located inside the mechanic plaza. It's a good place to grab lunch while waiting for your car. It's not my favourite shawerma place but quality is very good. Pita is too thick for my liking. They toast the pita first then stuff with with chicken and filling; I prefer it being made the other way (thinner pita, stuff it first then grill).  Chicken is well seasoned and good flavour. 
It gets quite busy at lunch time"}
