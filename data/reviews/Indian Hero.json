{"text":"Best butter chicken hands down. 

We went for dinner last night and ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka wrap, seekh kabab wrap, lamb biryani and lamb spinach. The wraps are really good too. I preferred the seekh kabab wrap but the Mrs preferred the chicken wrap. The wraps are huge and very filling. 

The biryani was OK. The chef has his own style which differs from what I am used to. Lamb spinach was also OK. I think I was more concerned about getting back to finishing the butter chicken instead of trying to enjoy them. 

Restaurant itself is clean and cozy and staff is very friendly. The cook is very knowledgeable and very passionate about their food. Everything is cooked to order and based on your preference on spice. 

I will definitely be returning to try the meat vindaloo and butter chicken next time I have a craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"Amazimg food,  staff was super nice the Naan and butter chicken is to die for amazing food must eat there again"}
{"text":"I have allergies and was phoning around to many different places to see who would be willing to leave them out of the food.. not even the expensive restaurants said they would be willing to. This was the only restaurant who said it wouldn't be a problem, which already made me very excited.
We had a group of 17, there was a bit of a wait since everything is prepared fresh..but so worth it!!! The food was amazing. I love indian food and know the difference between good and bad...This food was something else. I had baingan (eggplant), aloo gobi  (potato and cauliflower) and chana (chickpeas).. everyone else had a mix of veg and non - veg... everything tasted exceptional. My husband who doesnt like saag (spinach), loved the palak paneer and he also liked the butter chicken and the lamb biryani. 
I love that moment when you bite in to food and you get this whole rainbow of spices that leaves you in anticipation of what you are going to taste next. 
If you are not in a hurry, but want to try/eat truly good Indian food.. Please try this place out. It's not fancy or anything, but the quality of food is truly high. Svaadisht!"}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of dishes for takeout. The chicken karahi was not good...it felt like it had too much masala. It was overly spicy even though we asked for it to be mild. There was no way our kids could eat it.  The karahi paneer was just slightly better but also way too spicy.  
The service at the counter was good though, I would not eat here again, considering there are so many great Indian restaurants in the Brampton area."}
{"text":"Very nice authentic Punjabi restaurant . The owners make their food with love. It's always great to come there again and again when ever I crave for desi dhaba food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with really delicious food. The butter chicken was rich and tasty and id happily come here again!"}
{"text":"Food was good but now it has gone bad!! Service was always SLOW but now it's PATHETIC! If you call them 1 day ago, food will still not be ready when you go to pick up!! I was their regular customer but after terribly slow service, almost insulting! I gave up! Restaurant owners always has excuse to give for food not being ready!!"}
{"text":"This place has a Conditional Pass right now for their cleanliness of their restaurant, so I didn't order and walked out. 
It was EXTREMELY hot in the restaurant when we entered, I can't imagine food sitting at a safe temperature.
There was also a sign posted up on the restaurant stating if you use the washroom without permission (and I'm assuming if you're not a customer) that you will be charged $5. Is this even legal?
The pricing was also ridiculous for and Indian restaurant in Brampton. $14.95 for a take out container of butter chicken?! Are you insane?! And it's just butter chicken, no sides, no rice/naan.. nothing. 
Not coming back. 
Rant over."}
{"text":"I found the service terrible and the prices too high.  They don't even have real basmati rice for the curries only some stale gross frozen version of rice.  It was disappointing.   The food was brought out before bans so.everything was cold by the time the bans got there.  For the same money I could have gone to a nice restaurant that was efficiently run.  Also too much garlic in papri chat. It was overall one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"I had the chaat papri and the methi malai chicken for takeout. Both were very good - perfect amount of spice level, the flavours complimented nicely, and the chicken was tender and moist. Unfortunately, their menu is misleading, as they didn't yet have the samosas I asked for - \"still working on it,\" they assured me. 

As a sit-down restaurant, it would definitely work for small and larger groups. Small criticism: the lighting was a little harsh, but as I did takeout (and lighting isn't all together that important), this doesn't really count as much of a negative in my mind. 

The staff was very friendly, and service was quick, considering the food was made to order. Overall, definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I agree with one other reviews, this place aint worth 4/5 stars; not even close.

Just picked up a tandoori wrap and the food quality was sub par. No lettuce, one slice of tomato, and an overload of onions. Chicken tasted dry, like it just came out of the microwave."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian Restaurant even in Brampton! Freshly prepared dishes and tons of flavour. Tried the butter chicken with naan and Lamb chops. Wow! Was the lamb chops ever a delight! Definitely would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Freshly made curries and naan not a bad spot for takeout. I would not eat in as there is an odd plastic, burnt butter smell  that is quite bad.

Meat in the curries is top quality as are the spices. Oloo gobie (sp?) was good but under seasoned. Chicken tikka masala was great buy too rich and heavy. Asked for super spicy and they delivered with robust heat and flavor.  With a little tweaking this could definitely he a hero."}
{"text":"Actually authentic indian cuisine . Be prepared to wait for food cuz all there currys and everything is made from scratch not chicken tikka masala out of a jar. Best indian cuisine ive had ne where and ive had alot lol"}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken, a vindaloo and a couple of vegetarian dishes (paneer & eggplant). On all counts, the flavor was great. The butter chicken is of the more sweet & creamy style. The vindaloo was great and had a proper vindaloo taste; all to often they aren't distinctive and it was. Word of warning to those like my wife: The lamb is on-tho bone and it's therefore a bit fattier with a bit of gristle. Personally, I really like this because it tastes great, but my wife hates it. The Karahi Paneer is delicious.

The folks here are really nice and helpful, as mentioned in the other reviews. So why only 3 stars? I rarely take issue with price / portion, but I think that there is a bit of an issue here so I'm dinging them one star. They do take out in 3 sizes. In a large take out butter chicken ($22) there was at best one breast of meat. Between the four of us we had 3-4 cubes of chicken each. The rest was lots of gravy (though the container was only about half full). The Vindaloo ($18) was a medium and perhaps a better situation, depending on your thoughts vis-a-vis bone-in lower cost cuts of meat. A take out dinner for a family of 4 (two adults two kids) was $80. Perhaps the issue is with the large size container.

Would I return? Maybe, after I try some other spots and judge whether the quality is worth the price in comparison to the competition. I'll just avoid the large size next time."}
{"text":"Upgraded to 5 stars, from 3.5 stars. My last visit was with my big-little Nephew and we ate in. The food was amazing. We upgraded our spice level to \"Indian\" level , which is a couple down from \"Indian Hero\" level. Man what a meal. Had the Chicken Tikka Masala with some rice and nan bread. Very good!

Indian food all home cooked meals and super tasty rich spices. Was looking for a new Indian place to eat, which a was good and affordable, and I found it with Indian Hero. They have a full takeout menu full of wonderful curries and traditional Indian dished. The food is fresh and the taste spectacular. Call ahead and have everything ready for you when you pick up. If you eat in the restaurant is small, BUT THE FOOD! WOW I want to try the vindeloo next."}
{"text":"I really like the food, but it is extremely overpriced. I've ordered delivery here from Skipthedishes, and their takeout containers are horrible: foil tins with plastic lids that rip so easily and scratch your skin, plus it leaks everywhere. I also ordered the mango lassi; first time they forgot it, then the next time it finally came, it came in a paper coffee cup...very tacky"}
{"text":"I brought my team of five US contractors for a Sunday lunch.....wow! The food was so fresh with amazing spices and the right amount of heat....*****"}
{"text":"Food tasted really bad! I ordered the Tandoori chicken with Afghani rice. The rice tasted horrible..they had a weird taste to it. Chicken wasn't so bad..so I just ate the chicken and left the rice. Portions were small. My friend ordered a curry and some naan... The curry tasted good. However, Some of the stuff from the menu wasn't available. 

The waiter had really dirty hands and fingernails which grossed me out. Also his uniform was visibly dirty. 
To me appearance of the staff matters and it reflects the quality of the food and service!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Place is clean! One of the few restaurants that is clean and serves Indian food. The price point is great. Only had veg food, will defiantly come back to try the non-veg!"}
{"text":"I went to resturant to get take out. When i ordered dal makhani and chicken tikka, they said 25-30 mins wait as they make everything fresh. I thought that lets wait maybe its worth the wait. But was completely wrong. Chicken tikka was like sweet and did not taste good. Before going to pick up the food i called in after 20 mins if food is ready and the person said bluntly that you ordered 5 mins back. Wrong, i ordered long time back. So in all not good experience.
2 stars because the dal makhani tasted good."}
{"text":"They lie over the phone and price you something else in person.(Date of visit; April,21,2018, Time; 10:30pm) I was told over the phone that the Pani puri was $6 and I asked how much with yogurt and I was told \"I can do the same price with yogurt\". Once I got there and order, first of all the plate looked like something I could have made at home for $2 or less and then when I asked for the bill, they had the nerve to charge me $12!! When I mentioned that I called before and asked for the price with yogurt, they changed it back to $6. But it got me really upset that they had the nerve to change the price cause they assumed I didn't care, Not fair and avoid this place at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"***Review is based on a lunch takeout order***

Order placed via: Telephone

Order: 
Chicken Vindaloo
Tandoori Chicken
Butter Chicken
Palak Paneer
Chapli Chicken Kabob

Wait time: told wait would be 45 minutes, true wait time was about an hour - I guess we ordered in the midst of the lunch rush

The chicken vindaloo was easily the best dish, nice and spicy and flavourful as it should be. The other dishes were also solid, making Indian Hero a good takeout spot. I'd recommend avoiding the rush hour though, unless you're well aware and are able to order in advance. 1 hour wait is just way too long."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself. The butter chicken we had was nice and light and not too heavy and out came some very fluffy but crispy Nan's.  We also had the lamb chops which were delicious not overly fatty but flavorful. Since it was my first time in the area the parking is quite limited but it is worth the effort and I want to come again to try different things on the menu"}
{"text":"It's the first time we decided to try Indian food for Delivery.
Food was delivered hot, right down to the garlic naan. 
My boyfriend is not one for spicy food, where as I can generally take a little heat. Though flavorful it was more  spiciness than I expected, my boyfriend however loved it. We were complete opposites on this, but both agreed on what mattered... the dishes were overall delicious.

1) We had the Boneless Butter Chicken. Very nice - 5/5 for $22.00 (large), did not come with any sides. It was. rich, creamy and flavourful. *FAVE* 
2) Lamb Vindaloo - 3.5/5 (Not a fan of bones or the spicy level) for $18, did not come with any sides.
3) The Chicken Tikka Masala Signature - 2/5, came with naan, salad and basmati rice for  $17. Great deal but dry.
4) Yogurt for $2 was a nice saviour for the lamb Vindaloo and served to counter the spiciness nicely. - 5/5
5) Paratha for $2 each was sadly a disappointment, as I had a very West Indian (Caribbean) ideal of what it should be and the brown flat bread with black spots confused me, still was not bad, but certainly not stellar. - 3/5
6) Garlic Naan was $2 each, but lacked garlic flavour, not bad... but certainly not great. 2/5
7) Delivery had to be over $75 which is pretty easy to do considering the curry dishes don't come with rice or naan, which was a bit of a let down. 4/5
8) Person on the phone was pleasant and willing to work with our 'spiciness' fears, very professional and very pleasant. 5/5 for service.
9) Willing to deliver, which added to their rating. 

Overall the experience warranted 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"The Hungry Gills hit this place up a couple of weeks ago, it was our first time at the restaurant. We went around 7pm, and the restaurant environment was quiet with about 6 people sitting in. They have a nostalgic Super Nintendo system with Mario on it which was pretty cool, a kid played it as his dad had dinner. We walked in and asked for a booth, there was a drink spilled on the ground of the booth, so rather than cleaning it up the owner asked we sit on the other side of the booth beside each other....lol 

Karn ordered 1) Butter Chicken with Naan  2) Chapli Wrap
Neetu ordered  1) Channa Bhatura

You can tell that the owner really cares about how the customers feel, he was came by every table asking if everything tasted good -- it's just his workers or lack of workers really left a stain on the service. We waited for 25 minutes before the food arrived, and in that time the server forgot to deliver us our drinks. The owner was shocked, and yelled for the server to bring us water.

THE FOOD

The Butter Chicken was great, a nice blend of sweet with some kick. Karn is an absolute butter chicken fiend, and he made sure there was no gravy spared. But what always makes a good butter chicken is a buttery, flaky soft naan (the bread you eat the dish with). The naan was nothing special, it was below average. The naan tasted almost like the frozen naan you would find in a grocery store and place in a toaster. Crisp, not soft and just not very complimenting with the butter chicken. 

The Chapli wrap was delicious. On the menu as a Chapli burger, the owner recommended Karn to try it in wrap form, for you would get a better ratio of bread to meat. The chapli wrap contains a ground chicken patty which is marinated in tasty indian spices, tongue teasing chutneys(indian sauces), lettuce, onions and green chillies. The wrap was made with naan bread, and the bread used in the wrap was immensely better than the one that came with the butter chicken. Karn would definitely recommend this wrap as a lunch item for those who want a quick meal with some heat.

The Channa (or Cholay) Bhatura was below average. Channa is for a chick peas masala curry where bhatura is a deep fried bread used to eat the curry.  The chick peas were not cooked properly and actually hard. Channa should always contain very soft chick peas. This was disappointing. The bhatura was average.

PRICE
Chapli wrap - $10
Butter Chicken and Naan - $13
Channa/Cholay Bhatura - $8



The Bottom Line
If you are going and want a wrap with some indian kick, grab the chapli wrap.

{"text":"Great place for Indian food in an area full of spots for this type of cuisine...
Standouts: lovely location and cozy eat-in area - clean and bright, very comfortable!
Everyone that works here is incredibly friendly and will help you choose a dish that you're sure to enjoy if you are not too familiar with Indian food (which I am not!).
We usually order the channa masala and naan bread (which is made fresh) and it's a great treat. 
Need to try the butter chicken after reading these other reviews!"}
{"text":"Honestly, don't be fooled by the great reviews. The owner begs and guilts all of his customers into giving the restauarant a good rating.

Don't get me wrong, the food is somewhat decent (yes, I'm being VERY generous with that word). When given constructive criticism (which he had asked for) about the food the owner said we \"ordered the wrong things\"... What does that even mean? Our food wasn't up to par because we ordered it? Word of advice, don't blame your customers for having some standards.

Also, when we were about to order drinks the waitress simply told us to grab them ourselves from the fridge (behind the counter). This restaurant is far from professional.

Lastly, we were given a dish that was actually for the table next to us. We barely touched it because it was cold and it didn't taste good at all. However, the owner guilted us into paying for half of the price... Again, it was his mistake and we paid for it. Due to guilt.

If this sounds like the kind of bs you'd like to deal with, go pay them a visit. However, I'd never make the mistake of going there and expecting good food or good customer service... Again.

How's that for a \"good rating\"?"}
{"text":"alright so this is clearly a family run joint which is why we felt bad and stayed and why i also feel kind of bad writing this but ... at the end of the day its about customer experience as well as food so ..here we go . i found this place on yelp and based on the good reviews i convinced my bf to come here (he wanted to go somewhere else that he already knew was good). i should have listened. I HATE WHEN HES RIGHT. 

K ANYWAYS we called ahead to make sure a table was available. we walk in on friday night., there 2 little kids running around. 2 tables full of dirty dishes. one couple sitting and eating and one guy waiting for his take out. after about 5 min of awkwardly waiting for someone to come out. when the lady did come out she told us to sit at a table that had her kids snow boats/games thrown in front of it. this kind of unacceptable in my books, its a friday night and if you want business you should be making sure the front of your restaurant is clean even if your kids are running around. 

the food. we got fish pakoras which were way too greasy because they fried it in oil that wasnt hot enough. i like the taste it was just way too greasy

butter chicken i really liked, naan was good, goat biryani was also good. 

i wont be back because although the food was okay the first experience of the restaurant was terrible."}
{"text":"Little family run place, with an unwelcoming ambiance of disrepair and not so clean surroundings. Once you get past the disarray and poorly trained servers, the food is very delicious and was worth the suspense we felt while waiting for it to arrive. 

A word of advice to the owners - children rolling around on the serving / prep areas who were previously rolling on the floor is not really hygienic or appetizing for customers to watch.  They're extremely cute little girls, but touching everything and running in and out of the kitchen is a bit much - so I only give this place 3

Food was good though, so I would try this place again and hopefully they'll have cleaned up a little bit. 
The pics online show it was once a lovely place."}
{"text":"Very cute family run business. They stayed after their usual closing time to prepare a take out order for us. I was a little disappointed to find out when we got back that the order was wrong. The food was a strict ok, I've had much better lndian food in the GTA but I guess for the area as such I'd see it being probably very well liked. Seems like they're doing well considering it's only been 6 months since they opened. Very friendly staff and overall a cozy ambience for larger groups or families."}
{"text":"I loved the butter chicken, and the lamb briyani. Reason for the 4 stars is because of the dessert galab Jamon.. it was horrible.  And it's one of my favorite desserts, but I will be returning for the food. Must try! Great Customer Service! The Tandoori chicken is a Must try and the butter chicken once again.. it's Addicting! Trust me.. I know good food and this place has it. Made fresh Everytime, I think those complaining, honestly has to be for the long wait. Definitely Not the food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Carry out lamb vindaloo, rice, naan, and raita was all pretty good but not great.  I asked for 4 out of 5 on the spicy meter and it was not as hot as a normal vindaloo that I have had elsewhere.  Overall very flavorful and thick, rich gravy, but the spice could have been kicked up.  The lamb was lower quality than I'm accustomed to- fairly fatty and chewy, and a high bone to meet ratio.  The naan was the most bland I have ever had and the rice was more like a rice pilaf than a good spiced basmati.  Overall, I would recommend going for chicken instead of lamb and getting garlic naan or something more than the standard option.  Overall, average meal, which was a bit disappointing given the large indian population in the area."}
{"text":"Great food but expect to wait a while. Though good indian food always takes a long time."}
