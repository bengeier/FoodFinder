{"text":"The food was quite mediocre. . .I went with the steak dinner and was told by our waiter that it was one of their most popular dishes.  Well, the steak was pretty good, but that's pretty much a no-brainer.  However, the sides were tasteless. . .beans in a tempura batter that tasted greasy and mashed potatoes that had absolutely no flavor.  Scallops were quite scanty and again, quite tasteless.  One would hope there would be spices or herbs or an infusion of flavor in these.  Also tried the sushi which was  good (not great), but not something I'd go out of my way for.   Quite disappointing, and although the people working there are friendly, the experience was not one that would compel me to eat there again.  Also, and this has nothing to do with the food, but there was quite a bit of broken glass on the sidewalk right outside the building.  As a business owner myself, I always check our building's surroundings to make sure that my customers are not going to have to deal with such a danger."}
{"text":"My second favorite resturant in cleveland. This place is really good, I got some delicious fish, I think it was Ohio buckeye. The service was good too. Probably my first choice for a fish resturant."}
{"text":"It's ok... Nothing overly spectacular from my experiences here. I first went to Parallax a little over a year ago. One thing I must compliment them on is that their staff is very attentive and polite. The first time I came here I ordered the hanger steak and the second time I ordered the seared salmon. Both dishes were \"ok\" at best. I honestly felt like I've had better meals from chain restaurants specializing in seafood and steaks for a much cheaper price.   Its a nice place for dates because of the nice ambience but if you're going for a good meal I'd recommend other restaurants where you'd get more bang for your buck close by. Expect to pay at least $75 prior to tip."}
{"text":"This was my 4th time here and the service was timely although the heat cranking within the indoor patio was a little too much.  Started out with Hendricks gin and tonic which was made nicely. Had a potato pancake with salmon for an appetizer then dragon roll, philly roll, and unagi roll for entree. Sushi was tasty, but overpriced. For dessert, had some sort of raspberry truffle mousse cake which was ok. Very tasty food overall...If you don't mind dropping a dime on dinner for two than this is your place! Atmosphere is for sure trendy."}
{"text":"As a chef and father of a toddler my wife and I don't go out to eat much, but when we do I know we'll always have a great dining experience at any of Zack Bruell's restaurants. Service and food is the best you'll find in Cleveland. Period.   Please note: there is no corkage fee at any of Zack's restaurants. This is incredibly generous of the restaurant. For those of you who don't work in the restaurant industry PLEASE be aware of the unwritten rule when getting something for free. Tip on what the bill should have been.   Example: Your bill for two is $100 (not including the wine you brought). Say you're celebrating so you bring a nice $50 bottle of wine with you. Restaurants typically charge 2-3 times what they pay for the bottle. So instead of tipping your server $20 leave them $50, because your bill should've been $250.   Also, the last thing a server wants to do in the middle of the dinner rush is open wine. Especially if they think it's unlikely that they'll be tipped for it. Offer to pour them a glass. It's the right thing to do."}
{"text":"I just came for sushi with some girlfriends and was very impressed! I got the rainbow roll and it was incredibly fresh. My friends tried the spicy tuna and spicy salmon and loved them as well. There was also yummy warm bread and olive oil for dipping. I'm definitely planning to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there for my mother's birthday on Friday night.  Sat us on time for 5 people in their spacious side patio.  Restaurant was pretty busy, but service was outstanding.  The table shared the dumplings for the appetizer, they was quite tasty.  Also liked the tempura battered vegetables.  Everyone was happy with their meals, I personally had the shrimp and it was good.  Had some of the sushi around the table and it was also good.  Had awesome onion rings, real thin kind, sort of spicy.  Mojitos were great (better be at $10 a pop) and all in all, another great meal and service.  Been here 5-6 times and haven't had a complaint yet.  Menu seems to have something for everyone, service is great, not cheap, but feel you get you pay for.  Large portions generally."}
{"text":"I will give Parallax 4 stars because I enjoyed everything I ate but the seating arrangements could be enough to turn some people off. I went to Parallax for Valentine's Day and I was basically on a triple date as the tables were so close. We were literally 6 inches away from the tables to each side of us and could hear their entire conversations. It wasn't romantic to say the least.   As I mentioned I did enjoy the food. We ordered two basic maki sushi rolls for appetizers which were very good. The larger \"Specialty Rolls\" were very expensive and only 4 pieces. My trout was phenomenal and a very generous portion size. My girlfriend's Mahi Mahi wasn't nearly as good. It was a tiny piece of unseasoned fish. If you don't like sauces or spices on your fish you may enjoy it as you can only taste the charcoal from the grill.   I will definitely go back to Parallax but I would much rather go to one of Zack Bruell's other restaurants."}
{"text":"Cocktails were delish, I had the Pear 75. I don't generally like cocktails as I find them too sweet but this had a perfect blend.  Mussels as a starter were perfect, well cooked and soaking in a delicious broth.  I ordered off the specials menu for my entree and had the grilled paiche- my first time having this fish. This is a little spicy (I love spicy food) and served with singapore noddles. Others in the dinner group enjoyed walleye and braised loup de mer. No one was disappointed with their meals. We were all too full to try any dessert, but the waiter had mentioned the chocolate tar as being one of the more popular desserts.  The venue is nice and trendy. The service was impeccable. I'll definitely be back to try dessert again."}
{"text":"My wife an I had been here in the summer for appetizers, but this time it was dinner with friends.  We arrived as the snow was falling and had reservations, and were quickly seated...and that started the key problem.  Our table was in the area that would normally be open air in the summer, with garage doors.  It was cold, quite cold.  Like Asian restaurant camping cold.  I looked around a full room and saw people with coats on huddled over their tables, desperate for heat.  I thought about the years I lost to playing video games instead of joining the Boy Scouts, that rubbing two sticks together thing to make a fire would have come in handy.  Not sure why I did not ask for a better table, I should have.  But they should not still be using an outdoor area for seating in a high end restaurant, in December, in Cleveland.  I know the Browns can't win a game, but do we all have to be losers even at dinner?    Food was good: pot stickers and smoked salmon potato cakes, surf and turf  rolls for me.  Service was good.    Restaurant would be great if it was actually comfortable.  Zack Bruell should sleep out there sometime and see what that is like."}
{"text":"Perfectly seared salmon, wonderful ambiance, and just slightly cooky, but very respectful waiters. Would make a trek across town to come here for a nice date for sure. :)"}
{"text":"What is great in life?  Being with friends, close in at the table, great conversation, wine and food. Without a doubt, our night at Parallax was one of the best dining experiences I have had in my life.  The service  was perfect- not too much, not too little - just right.  Our apps were great but the star of the show besides the company ;) was the skate wing.  I have never had a better meal in my life.  when in Cleveland you must go to Parallax.  It's all great."}
{"text":"Terrible service inconsistent food.  We had a 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  All of the servers were kept busy with a party in the back room--we didn't get our salads for 45 minutes.  No one checks back, no one asks if you want to have your water refilled if they are working that back room.  We spent 2 hours over a dinner that should have taken half that time.  The food and portions are very inconsistent.  The potato cake with salmon should be served on a thinner and crisper potato cake.  The tofu entree was way too small for the vegetarian in our party.  Note to server:  do mention to the guest that they might also want to order additional food.  Hangar steak was quite good but some vegetables were cold others steaming hot.  Enormous portion of pomme frites were good but cold--the vegetarian ate them anyway he was quite hungry!  On a cold evening, do not sit anywhere near the door or the aisle leading to the door--the cold draft ruins a nice evening.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Parallax.  A displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight.  Intriguing, but ultimately, as my first dining experience here, I'm not sure that it worked.  The building housing the restaurant is like a lot of older buildings in the area, which belies the sleek and minimalist interior.  The bar area was buzzing, with 2 giant flat screen TVs blasting a sports game.  Is this the bar of a fancy restaurant, or do I spot drunken revelers yelling at the TV?  Ugh.  Once seated, we were presented with a metal clipboard, with about 8 pages of paper on it.  I've been to other restaurants that use clipboards for the menu, but 8 pages?  The main theme of the dishes seemed to be Asian fusion, with a bit of Southern and Latin fusion thrown in.  There were also 2 pages of sushi and related items available at any sushi restaurant.  Our waitress was friendly, and service overall was efficient.  When we asked for more bread, the bread guy appeared right away.  I started with the Laughing Bird Shrimp with Watermelon, Tomato, and Cucumber Salad in a lemon-herb vinaigrette.  It is a big salad.  The shrimp were very sweet.  The combination of watermelon and tomato let me hang on to summer, even though this was one of the colder Labor Day weekends in memory.  For my entrée, I had Trout stuffed with Thai Flavors with Bamboo Rice.  This was a good take on traditional Thai angel wings.  The stuffing, mainly glass noodles and crab flavored with lemongrass, was good.  The texture was a little on the soft side.  Combine that with the tender trout, it got a little mushy as I continued to eat the dish.  For dessert, I had the peach ice cream.  This was my biggest disappointment of the evening.  It mainly just tasted of cream and sugar.  There was nothing to show that it was peach, except for the color, which was hard to see under dim lighting.  Why 3 stars?  This is a 2 1/2 if there were half stars.  I think Parallax is ok, and definitely a top choice for the area.  It lacked a bit of soul perhaps.  With all the sleekness it exuded, it needed some warmth to balance it.  The food is good, but the menu is a tad unfocused.  I get it that it's full-on Asian fusion.  And if they want to offer straight sushi, that's fine too.  But somehow I got the feeling that I was at 2 different restaurants.  Now, is that intentional?"}
{"text":"Great location in trendy Tremont. Lots of street parking and safe neighborhood. Greeted with a smile, provided with a choice of bar, dining room or outdoor dining. Water, bread and server arrived shortly after. Downside - not given a choice of bottled or tap water, hard plastic stackable chairs in the dining room.  Sushi appetizer arrived quickly, excellent quality and above average presentation. Gazpacho soup and green tossed salad were very good, excellent house balsamic dressing.  Blackened redfish - excellent taste and portion size, fair presentation. Green dragon roll - excellent taste, fair presentation. Solid 4 plus stars, just short of 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi once again. I was there last night with the mom for Monday half price sushi night. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The appetizers we had here were very good! However, we wanted sushi and it was really difficult to eat. It was just OK. We didnt try any entrees so Im sure those are good.....but if you want sushi, this is not the place. We also felt it was a bit overpriced. Service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Having gone to another one of these infamous \"Zach Bruell\" restaurants (and absolutely loving it) I was excited to try this one. I love Japanese/Asian food, and the other place blew me away, so this had to be good. And it was... good. It didn't blow me away like the other place though, and it certainly didn't wow me. It was just a slightly better than decent Asian-ish fare meal.  To me, it really seemed like a Japanese restaurant for people, or for an area, that didn't know Japanese food. So they took Japanese inspired menu items, and then shoehorned in fried food or the ever-hipster-trendy pork belly. Japanese food should be about the quality of the ingredients, and how those flavors are able to shine through. Japanese food is delicate, with a distinct balance of flavors. This was decidedly mid-western food served on top of udon noodles.  Again, to be fair, it was good, just as long as you go into it knowing that you are getting American food served with rice."}
{"text":"I found the service fine, not overwhelmingly friendly but certainly above average for the Cleveland market (which I don't find extgremely service-friendly anywhere on a global comparision). The food was very good as I've come to expect from Zack Bruell's restaurants and certainly was the standout expeirence of the evening."}
{"text":"First time coming here. All I can say is, wow. Great service, food came in a decent time. Food was amazing. I had the Japanese shrimp and the seafood stew. Both phenomenal. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Parallax three times now. The first two were many years ago. I was really impressed then, but my pocket book was so much lighter afterwards, it just got put on the back burner of places to go back to.   But after our most recent meal, I think we'll be going back again regularly. The main fish entrees have all been fantastic, but we saved a pretty penny by sticking to salads and sushi rolls. We were very full afterwards, and got to try a bunch of stuff.   The service was excellent. The waitress knew the menu front to back, and gave us lots of time when we needed it. The menu itself (strapped to a clipboard) was a bit hard to read, and too big, but she helped tremendously with that.   Things we loved:  Nigiri Salmon. I often get this at restaurants because its my favorite, and can be a benchmark for the sushi quality. This little piece of fish was a solid FIVE STARS. And only $5 for two small pieces, maybe slightly below the Cleveland average.   Goat Cheese Endive Salad. I've never really had a salad like this. There are no leafy greens to speak of. You can't go wrong with fried goat cheese. I thought it balanced nicely with endives in a light creamy dressing. And candied walnuts added a bit of sweet to the mix. Every bite was fun.  Beet Salad. There was a really interesting aroma that I couldn't place. Made me want more. With that said, once eating the beets, that flavor dominated all. Maybe smaller bites of beet next time.   Spicy Fried Onion Rings: Bears no resemblance to something yo would get at Outback Steakhouse. Definitely not good for you, but wow, tasty addictive. I'm betting the key here is very fresh/good frying oil. Since that's mandatory for good tempura, I can see why the onion rings turn out so tasty. Next time we get a little sloshed in Tremont, we are going here to down some of those to absorb the boose."}
{"text":"Parallax, Parallax.  Led by the salty, creative and adorable Zach Bruell, staffed with friendly  and attentive servers and bartenders (almost too many to mention! Dax (with those oceanic blue eyes), Tiffany(cuter than sugar), Chris, Heather, and on and on) and professional to a \"T\". What are the best things about Parallax? Well, let's start when you walk in the door. The decor. Modern, spare, nothing to detract from the menu and the food. No bric-a-brac, no dust, no nasty carpeting. Just the sleek and inviting bar. You can eat at the bar. And that's fun, because the place attracts lots of regulars from the Tremont area during the week, and lots of downtown workers. Good people watching. We almost always sit at the bar unless we have a larger crowd; that way we can meet people, and we have met some great characters at that bar. Really interesting people. Authors, artists, bond traders, and undertakers. Just to name a few. Why not expand your horizons, eh? What else are you doing? Take advantage of the valet parking, by the way. Let's take a look at the menu (after you get your drinks, of course). They always have two or three interesting specials, at least one of which is a special fish dish. Did I mention the full and expertly prepared sushi menu? Try the white tuna sashimi with fresh jalapeno. The cream soup of the day? The different and delightful side dishes? (latin style cream corn, mac and cheese, shoestring onion rings, and on and on). You could make a meal of the sides if you cared to. But why not look at the appetizers? One of the wonders of Parallax is that they are ALWAYS changing the menu. From week to week, if you look, you're going to find a new salad, a new appetizer, a new fish, and so on. You will never experience that \"Oh, geez, it's the same old menu they had last month\" feeling. There is usually a wonderful iteration of a seared scallop salad. Sometimes it might be those sparkling scallops on a bed of arugula with some crispy bacon and a creamy dressing. Sometimes it might be with Bibb lettuce and scrambled eggs with truffle. It doesn't matter what it is. Get it. It's good. If you like escargot, you have arrived at Nirvana, for the version that Parallax has on the menu is plump, juicy, tender, garlicky, buttery and topped with light, crispy crumbs. Get it. Eat it. Love it. Why don't you try the Thai seafood stew? Better than any Asian restaurant in town so far. Incredible. How about short ribs? Like 'em? Love 'em!! They come in a different preparation and with different sides every week. Every fish entree is incredible. Every appetizer is wonderful. What about the desserts? WOW! Bread pudding of the day! What's wrong with THAT? My favorite thing about Parallax is that you can make a varied meal out of small plates and wildly diverse tastes and YOU can control the experience. They care, it shows, and you win. Parallax. I'm going there right now, and I'll see you at the bar. Carnation in the lapel."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Lunch, right across the way from South Side, same prices but better food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food consistently. Black cod entree was superb. The waiter was attentive but not too pushy."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! I liked how there was a center table down the dining area to house all the things servers need so they don't have to constantly go to the kitchen or look for things. actually incorporated this idea in a Weighing Station at a Manufacturing facility to service Mixing areas and bumped up efficiency by 20% and mistake dropped by 40%.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Short and Sweet:  Parking: Valet your car for God's sake! It is an inexpensive luxury and the $5+tip you would save is not worth the hassle of finding a place to park! Attendant was courteous and fast!  Hostess: Efficient, pleasant (both in demeanor and appearance!)  Bar: Bartender acknowledged me as soon as I stepped to the bar. Poured a good drink. No hassles transferring drinks to table.  Waiter: Knew the menu, friendly but not familiar - YES, it does bother me when someone is overly friendly with me in a nonsocial environment. Glasses never sat empty, empty plates never stayed on the table. His name was Chuck - he is good. I hope I get him again.   Food: You can tell that they think about the food they are offering. Nothing crazy or silly. Just enough off-the-beaten-path offerings to appeal to an adventurous palate. I had the warm wild mushroom salad, lamb curry and coconut cheesecake. - All of them were very nice.   Wine list: Serviceable without being overwhelming. Good selections. Chuck made sure the bottles kept coming and the glasses stayed full!  Dessert Drinks: Nice selection of sherries and ports. Unusual in that you usually do not find many restaurants that actually cater to folks that like those two things. They even used the correct glasses to serve the Dow's 10 year that I ordered.  THE BILL: Reasonable for what you receive! Good service, good food, good, laid back atmosphere with a splash of upscale to it. Liked it very much. I will be bringing clients here again. We had a party of 8 and stayed well south of $1k, which is really quite good considering we consumed 3 bottles of wine and everyone had appetizers and after dinner drinks and dessert.   Final note: If you remember your waiter's name, it is usually because they were great, or they were terrible. Chuck was the former. He was not obtrusive at all into our business conversation and kept all courses and drinks moving very nicely."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Great sushi, cocktails, and desserts! Would recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with our experience last night. Service was okay but the food was overpriced for what it was. I would go back for sushi though just to give it another shot. Wouldn't recommend it for the entrees though."}
{"text":"So good!  I was looking for a sushi restaurant and stumbled across this gem. It's more of a Japanese fusion restaurant with a fine dining feel. I ordered escargot and a wild mushroom salad as my appetizer and they blew me away. My sushi dish included eel, tuna, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp, and streak. It was phenomenal. The price was fair, especially considering the quality of food, and the restaurant has an urban neighborhood vibe. It's Zagat rated and is definitely in that tier of restaurant.  Parking sucks, but it's worth dealing with it."}
{"text":"This was our third stop on our tour of Zack Bruell restaurants.  We are new to the area and absolutely LOVE Chinato so we had to try Parallax. The atmosphere in the main dining room is modern. We were seated in the back room which has space heaters and much less to appreciate.   The staff were friendly and helpful.   Unfortunately, the meal was disappointing. We tried both the sushi and American items on the menu. The sushi was mediocre at best.  There was too much cilantro on the Hamachi which was not the freshest. The  crudo at Chinato is miles better.  The pork shank and  scallops were very good but with all the excellent restaurants in Tremont, I wouldn't say it's a must try."}
{"text":"This place used to be a cozy, warm and special destination at one point. Now it is nothing more than an overcrowded, overrated, sticky table, mediocre hole in the wall -just another restaurant- kind of place. They squeeze you in between other tables so tight that you feel like you are sitting at one table with the other diners. You literally have to speak louder than normal to carry on a conversation with your company. This may be a positive aspect if the food was worth it, but it just isn't. Not anymore! Nothing spectacular here: the sushi is just average and the menu is boring. Sanitary levels at the table and in the bathrooms are below standard. Did not wander into the kitchen, so no comment there. Cleveland has a lot to offer when it comes to dining out. Keep looking...Nothing special here!"}
{"text":"Can't remember all the food we consumed due to a few drinks beforehand (this was the second stop on a date night with someone new), but the spicy sushi and the dumplings were spot on. Big city atmosphere, cool people and great food. Would definitely return. Parking was a challenge, but fortunately only our driver had to worry about that."}
{"text":"I got the swordfish belly...and holy shit it was the best fish I've ever had, the corn and pepper sauce that came with it paired so well with the fish I was blown away. Also our waiter was great and gave us in depth answers to any questions we had, even when the women next to us had an extended list of things she didn't want in her food (milk, butter, flour), it's like why did you even come out to eat lady? He was still very nice and attentive to her and didn't act annoyed, God bless that waiter. I'll definitely be back. Zach Bruell is hands down the best chef in Cleveland in my opinion."}
{"text":"Unfortunately was very disappointed with my husband and my recent meal. Our waitress was lovely but the food was below average at best. I found the prices to be very high and the food was bland. I ordered the tuna and my husband the seafood stew special. This restaurant did not meet our expectations. We will not return."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, flavorful and interesting and suprising. Many specials options. Had squash blossoms with housemade ricotta cheese, those amazing potstickers, and cucumber and eel roll. Service was just fine, no complaints. We had reservation and were seated promptly. Bathrooms could be better and tables are really close together, but I would go back for the food in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely for the seafood lover, the fish is consistently fantastic. The atmosphere is trendy, sometimes too much for its own good, but never too snobby that prevents me from coming back.  Why not the 5 stars?  The sushi- while the fish is as stated before- excellent and fresh- the rice.... less than stellar.  Mushy, no taste, and pre-rolled for fast preparation completely ruins it.  Even so, I recommend the restaurant (just forgo the sushi)"}
{"text":"Boo yah.  Good service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"While I still have some of the same complaints about Parallax, I am reviewing again to raise the rating to 4 stars.  This is mostly due to dishes I have tried recently, and the quality of service.  Last night I dined at Parallax.  I arrived at 10:30 when their kitchen closes at 11.  However, our server Chris was very friendly and gave no indication that it was a bother.  He gave us great recommendations on wine and was very friendly throughout the meal.  I ordered the chicken.  It is almost exactly the same as the chicken breast at L'Albatros, except with different accoutrements.  It was very good.  We also had the gnocchi for an appetizer.  It wasn't quite what I expected, because of the brown butter.  It made the gnocchi oilier than I am used to, but the flavor was very good.  Because it was late at night, there weren't very many tables.  We ate in the lounge area which I think is a little more comfortable than the main dining room can be when it is busy.  I am enjoying Parallax more each time I visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! We really enjoyed our visit last night. Friendly hostess and a helpful server! We loved the spicy tuna roll so much we actually ordered an extra instead of dessert! The others were all top notch as well. Everything was very fresh and beautifully plated as well!  We will certainly visit again while in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, man. This restaurant gets tons of hype and people love it.  I think a lot of people love it because it's the cool thing to do, but this food is seriously mediocre.  I go here occasionally and only because other people want to, and every time the food has been bland and boring.  I mean, the presentation of the food and the atmosphere are very nice, and people wanna go somewhere trendy in Tremont, so this place does fine, but in terms of food... just nah."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had but other food is good. The atmosphere is nice, it's a good place for a night out. My husband and I love the potato pancake appetizer (I think that's what it's called). The sushi was decent, first time I've had it in Cleveland so maybe for Cleveland it is good."}
{"text":"I feel like Yelp let me down a bit on this one, sorry. The appetizers were pretty good - my husband had the sashimi salad (nice dressing) and I had a spicy salmon roll. But the entrees really weren't all that. My husband had the pork with bacon mac and cheese, and I had the udon with rock shrimp and pork belly. My husband's food seemed pretty boring, and mine came in lukewarm with even some cold patches (they did reheat it for me when I asked, but they didn't seem all that apologetic). The pork belly was overcooked and tasted bleah and the shrimp was just boring. I usually don't care much about presentation either way, but the entrees really fell below the usual standards for this type of place in terms of how they looked. If you want a much more interesting and tasty take on this kind of Udon dish (or Asian fusion generally), go to Umami in Chagrin Falls. I reserve judgment on the sushi part of the menu as we didn't have much of it, and what we had wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I have been to Parallax several times - eaten at the bar and at a table, just for drinks and for full dinner.  Was always happy.  Not sure - maybe they are getting old now.   Started with sushi and sashimi - that was really good.  My pear 75 was really good.  Then, dinner came.  I had the salmon with tempura green beans.  It was served in a \"broth\" with rice - the tempura got soggy and floated off the green beans - so much so that I had to pull the soggy tempura out of my dish and set it aside in a soggy pile on my plate.  Not sure how tempura in a broth was thought to be a good idea - but it wasn't.  Service - meh.  Had to wait for a glass of wine for a too long - nothing to sip on while I was eating for about 15 minutes.  Server never thought to ask how my meal was, even with the soggy breading sitting in a pile on my plate.  We ordered the ginger creme brûlée for dessert.  AWFUL.  The custard itself was gritty - but even worse - the top was rock solid - like a jolly rancher, you had to smash through it - and I ate one piece of it and thought I would break a tooth - we sent it back and asked for the bill as quickly as we could get out of there.  Left un-satisfied, still hungry and frustrated.  Went to the Barrio in Lakewood and ordered some outstanding tacos ....... not sure I will be heading back to Parallax - pretty disappointing experience - will head to Crop for awesome service, food and experience next time."}
{"text":"I came here Wednesday to celebrate a friend's birthday. We did not have reservations, but we were quickly seated and we had our choice of locations within the restaurant. The warmed goat salad was incredible! We order one of the platters (can't recall the name but it had spicy tuna, tiger shrimp, tuna, and yellowtail), a speciality roll (a spicy scallops- unbelievable flavor!), and fresh crab California roll. Our food was very tasty! However, service was not ideal. The staff member serving bread and refilling water did not appear happy and was slow to refill both. Our waitress was also slow as we often were waiting at times to order (we ordered in shifts, but informed her of our plan to do so). Overall good food."}
{"text":"Took the hubster here for his birthday this year as our fancy outing. The ambiance was great, it was dimly lit but not so bad that I was fumbling around in the dark. Very romantic. We were seated right away (remember to make a reservation!) and brought water and bread practically before I had finished settling into my chair.  Our waitress was very attentive and was able to give me a wine recommendation (which ended up being delicious). We ordered a cucumber sushi-type appetizer and it was good - fresh. For my entree, I got the tofu and veggies...and holy balls, it was amazing. The tofu was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist and full of flavor on the inside. Vegetables were grilled yet still crisp, just the way they should be. It came with some kind of yummy chili-lime sauce that was spicy but not TOO spicy. I can't remember what I got for dessert, but it involved berries and chocolate and was also delicious.  A bit pricey, but the service and food were worth it to me. Parking kind of sucks, so be prepared and bring cash to valet it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it's a bit small inside and the tables are close together. I sat next to a loud-yet-awkward couple who were very obviously on a blind date and their conversation was...interesting, to say the least.  Definitely looking forward to going back though!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I got the seaweed salad to start and my buddy got the wedge which were super good. For our entrees my friend got the Swordfish which we both thought it was the best we ever had. I got duck confit which was amazing as well. Our server was very menu knowledgeable and friendly I think her name was Janelle if I remember correctly. I will definitely be coming back for everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Just amazing.  Went here after a nice night on the town, we came In for a drink or two, and ended up hanging out and getting some of the best sushi I've ever had, but got the coolest service and sushi bar experience of my life.   I agree, it's pricey on the menu, but we sat next to the sushi bar, and just BS'ing with the sushi chef for a few, we ended up in some amazing sushi tower just by telling him what we liked, and he took it to the next level.  We DEFINATLY got super hooked up, and I'll leave it at that. I know that it's expensive, but the ambiance and food take it."}
{"text":"We intended to head to Lolita in the same general area, but they were fully booked by noon for that day.  It turned out to be a blessing in disguise and I'm so glad that we chose to go to Parallax instead!  When we were seated, our very attentive and friendly waiter came over immediately to advise and take our drink orders.  I ordered a malbec that was delicious and complimented the rest of my meal well.  The wine list was very expansive and everyone was able to find something they really enjoyed.  I ordered a cup of the lamb mulligatawny, which was full of flavor and had a great consistency.  For an entree, I ordered the quinoa stuffed kale leaves.  They were deceivingly filling and the mustard sauce that was over the quinoa was delicious.  I finished with a sorbet dessert that had raspberry, lemon, and mango sorbet.  It was all made in-house and was a perfect, light finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I'm thrilled with the food. A go-to restaurant in Cleveland where everything is just right. When you know you want food that will delicious this is the place. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It has an EXTENSIVE, eclectic menu with several different types of cuisine.  Its originality--from the steel clipboard menus to the long table in the middle of the room keeping your beverages chilled in large bowls of ice--is what makes it stand out.  The food is great, too.  The fact that it is literally on my street corner is not the best part about Parallax, but it's probably the best part about living where I do.  I've had a number of different appetizers: duck spring rolls (yummmmm), different salads (the seaweed/squid one is amazing), edamame (just the right amount of salt).  However, I know I might be lame in saying so, but I've only ever had their sushi as a main course, because I love sushi so much, and this is the only place around that does it decently (or maybe at all; haven't found any other Japanese restaurants here yet).  The maki combo (spicy tuna, cucumber, california) is plentiful and well worth the $13 price tag.  Other items on the menu might seem a bit expensive.  Other big hits from family include the grilled salmon with garlic crust and creamed corn, the arctic char with sesame seed crust and Japanese mayo, and the monkfish osso bucco.    Desserts are, like the rest of the menu items, a bit avant-garde; cheescake (with grapefruit infused crust) was a small, but filling, disc sitting in a pool of sugary-sweet sauce; the Napoleon was a deconstructed, open-on-all-sides tower of airy wafers and rice cream.  The sorbet/ice cream helpings are very generous, and you can mix and match.  Haven't tried the Greek yogurt with honey and fresh berries, because that sounds more like breakfast food to me, but I might one day because it sounds so appetizing.  Even something as minor as the way my tea was served deserves mentioning: the waitress brought out a wooden box of specialty teas in silken pouches, and then, once I had chosen one, she brought out the hot water in a nice-sized pot alongside a variety of sugars (LOVE the fact that they have natural sugar lumps you can drop into your tea or coffee!).  The pot held enough water for 2 1/2 - 3 cups of tea.  Each time we have been here, we got treated exceptionally well by the hostesses, bussers/breadpeople (did I mention they keep refilling the bread?!?  And they have specialty sea salt?  Love it!), and servers.  We also went here once just for drinks and dessert, and were treated just as well.  Overall, a great experience for something a little out of the ordinary.  If family is visiting, and they've been talking smack about Cleveland, take them here to shut them up."}
{"text":"My husband and I were guests of another couple on Saturday night. We'd looked at the menu online; much to our surprise, the menu online is NOT the current menu. Not a huge issue, but an annoying one and easy to fix. Nonetheless, saw that the menu was \"Asian fusion\", which could be almost anything. Good? Bad? We were a bit nervous to test it out. BUT, were we pleasantly surprised. Everything was AMAZING! We shared a few appetizers. The escargot with edamame was amazing! My husband loved the vegetable tempura, while the homemade Thai sausage was great. Zack Bruell's culinary talents do not disappoint. We also ordered salads and entrees. Big mistake! Way too much to eat! Stick with sharing appetizers and sushi. Save room for dessert, especially the Thai coffee parfait. I didn't order it; my friend did. Was I sorry that I couldn't have HER dessert all to myself. Vibe is young and hip. We are neither, but it doesn't matter. Service was great. One final tip: We were seated in the area that is the outside patio in warmer months. I'd ask to be seated in the main dining room. Just a bit classier for a special night out. That and the wrong menu online caused Parallax to lose a star, but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"As \"fusion\" as it can go and still taste great with a casual feel that doesn't make you feel uncomfortably bound."}
{"text":"Dear Chef Bruell,  It's time to come around to Parallax and check in on the dishes coming out of your kitchen. I'm serious. I even signed up for yelp to write this review just because I was THAT disappointed in the meal that I just had tonight. Yes, that's right, this is my first ever review - my apologies that it is a negative one. Since I have had many many wonderful meals in Cleveland that I could rave about - and will, just to even it all out. First off, we had salads, I was informed after receiving the goat cheese salad that it is your best selling salad. I can see that, but not to my taste. I had to really adjust to it - it was sweet and overdressed. The goat cheese itself was delicious - but who can go wrong with breaded and fried goat cheese? Still, are the cranberries and candied walnuts really necessary? To be really frank, everything tasted that way - overdone and over-thought.. My partner had the beet salad, it was dusted with blue cheese - there were a few large pieces - but most of it was this sort-of dandruff of blue cheese. It really looked terrible. The flavors worked together fine, though nothing special. Then the main entrees came and that's when the real trouble began. I ordered the swordfish. I'm still looking for it.  It was like a weiner schnitzel of fish - sashimi size. Poor swordfish. And technically it wasn't \"stuffed\", rather it was rolled. The stuffing was supposed to be crab and corn - it was more like breadcrumbs and a few kernels of corn. I honestly couldn't find the crab. Nor could I taste any of what was supposed to be in the dish because there was a ladle full of red pepper \"soup\" over the entire dish. Oh! and lest I forget the chard - overcooked and more like canned vegetables at the bottom of the plate that had been stewed to a point of mush. My guest had the walleye - where was the middle of it? The pieces of fish were literally two fingers in width. I'm not sure it's even legal to catch walleye that small. The fish was cooked perfectly - which is more than i can say for the swordfish. However, we did not order corn chowder with a crouton of walleye. The beans were the best part of the dish. How sad.   I can't emphasize enough what a terrible meal it was. I'm sure there are folks out there that won't understand what I'm saying - and that's fine, everyone has different taste.  I don't need big portions, and I can handle unusual combinations. But nothing worked, and I felt overcharged for a meal that I didn't enjoy at all.  Truly your restaurant is currently completely over-rated. I hope you (and readers of yelp) take this to review to heart."}
{"text":"Great sushi especially when you see the size of the rolls.  One of the best spots in Cleveland.  Great menu with a ton of options that are worth coming back multiple times. Very good wine and beer selection also.  The only minor issue was sitting in the extension part during the winter was a little cold."}
{"text":"Crazy good.  Extensive menu with a variety of Asian Fusion, sushi, etc.  I could NOT decide among the pork chop, miso black cod and sushi.  I ended up ordering the spicy tuna roll and the beet salad with feta and cumin lemon vinaigrette.  Major WIN.  Service was very attentive from the water to the bread to the entrees.  This place does a great job.  Trendy yet inviting interior.  The Green Hour happy hour is worth considering."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Probably won't go back unless meeting others there.  Couldn't order half the menu due to chef not being there. No one was thrilled the the meal, but there were no complaints either."}
{"text":"Finally tried parallax on a Friday lunch hour. I have heard great reviews and they were right my meal was perfectly prepared and incredibly satisfying. Thank you Tremont once again for not disappointing. I found the pricing very reasonable for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"I am blown away by this restaurant.  From the decor to the service to the food, everything is awesome!  I came for a Friday date night because we were having a sushi craving and supposedly this place has some awesome sushi.  I'm down!  And yes, it was awesome!  We ordered a bottle of wine, the beet salad from the specials menu, a roll from the specials menu (I think it was called the Rex Roll), the combination platter of sashimi of yellowtail, tuna, and white tuna, the Green Dragon Roll, and a chocolate mousse cake that wasn't on the menu.  Every single thing we ordered was great!  The salad was crisp and refreshing, the sushi was fresh and flavorful, and the cake was basically a slice of crack that we devoured in seconds.  I loved the semi-outdoor patio seating, it was beautiful and added a great touch to the overall experience.  The prices were amazing for the quality too.  A meal like this in my home city of New York would cost at least $75 more!  Parallax, my entire evening with you was PERFECT.  Next time a Cleveland sushi craving hits, I know where I'm going."}
{"text":"Great place, the decor is very upscale and clean while the service and food are excellent - plus they have a great happy hour from 5-7pm which makes it much less expensive.  I have tried a few things on the menu during multiple visits so far everything has been very good - mussels, pork belly & watermelon, and sushi.  The entrees look great too and while the prices aren't cheap they don't seem too bad given that you're getting really fresh fish and ingredients prepared well.  In terms of cocktails you absolutely can't go wrong and the wine list is truly one of the best I've seen in quite a while - whoever runs the beverage program here is doing a spectacular job.  Definitely worth a visit, and an outstanding value during Happy Hour as long as you can get a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Great, fun atmosphere. Has great happy hour. Love the tempura green beans and their happy hour sushi. Also great drink selection. Definitely will continue going back."}
{"text":"Last night, my girlfriend and I made a reservation via OpenTable for dinner at Parallax. It came highly recommended and we were excited to try this place. When we arrived, the entrance and bar were overflowing with patrons. We approached the host, who, without even asking if we had a reservation told us \"I'm on about an hour and a half wait\". I mentioned that we had a reservation, and he asked the name. After finding it, he continued by saying \"So you do. As I mentioned, I'm on an hour and a half wait and there are people with reservations from an hour ago who haven't been sat yet\".   The bottom line is that we never got to experience Parallax, nor will we try again. Clearly their staff has no customer service training, and either they're incapable of running efficiently or drastically overbook their capacity.  Save yourself the time and energy...go elsewhere in Tremont. We ended up eating at Fahrenheit and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Is this place serious?! First the prices on the restaurant menus are more expensive than the online prices. The sushi is a joke and the service is horrible.  Ordered carry out and waited in the restaurant for an hour. The hostess who was a few steps from me was too busy talking to another hostess to even acknowledge that my order was done. After an hour of frustration I asked for my food and she said I had to go to the bar to get it. For the price this sushi is a complete joke. My two dishes totaled to 37 dollars (2 entrees). A couple of thin slices of fosh and terrible maki rolls. On top of that when ordering over the phone my total was 27! If you guys want quality sushi for a great price head over to Pacific East. This is the first and will be the last time I eat from this place."}
{"text":"The last three times I ate there, I have had an upset stomach later that night/the next day."}
{"text":"The sushi is some of the best in the city as is the vibe.  We don't go too often as we live in the suburbs and don't particular care for the neighborhood, though it is becoming more of a destination."}
{"text":"The decor of the pace is very modern- we ended up sitting on the closed in patio but they had heaters on the ceiling so the temperature wasn't n issue. I am not a huge sushi fan I got a basic spicy tuna roll which was very good- everything tasted fresh and the presentation was excellent. Other members of my party got sushi along with other items and everyone was satisfied"}
{"text":"Our first time at Parallax - the rainbow roll and yellowtail with cilantro is delicious!! My husband ordered the trout and he loved it. He said it was the most amazing thing. We got the potato pancakes with salmon and capers -omg delish!! We also ordered a $20 lobster roll - which wasn't worth it at all. But the rainbow roll - it melts in your mouth. Fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"Delicious. First time dining at Parallax. Very professional and knowledgeable service!! We had an Oyster sampler that was super fresh, tasted like the ocean. Also had a spicy tuna roll along with nigiri (tuna, salmon and shrimp over rice) and it was so good we opted to order another round. The entire menu has a wide variety of cooked and raw seafood and there seemed to be something for everyone, even if you're not into seafood. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in and sat at the bar last night and had one fantastic evening.  First off, the cocktail menu included my favorite drink, an aviation cocktail.  Hard to find anywhere!  It got even better from there.  I love oysters but also hard to find good ones in Cleveland.  The dozen were sweet and fresh.  My boyfriend had the mussels and he was equally pleased with his choice.  I had the walleye and he ordered trout.  We could not decide which entree was the best as they were both perfection.  The service was impeccable.  Very friendly and efficient staff.  Loved the casual atmosphere and the vibe of the neighborhood.  There is outdoor seating and a beautiful dining room. A very special evening.  We look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  Left something to be desired -- mixture of TVs and intimiate, dark atmosphere made it somewhat difficult to brand this restaurant inside the main area.  Since I visited recently we sat outside on the enclosed patio for winter, which was a little cool and felt a little noisy for the very 'warm' atmosphere Parallax seems to attempt to portray.  However, patio would be a perfect 5 in the summertime.  Cost:  Fair for sushi, entrees all $20+ but large food portions.  Beverage prices typical, with a few extras and 1-2 drinks per person a bill probably averages ~$40 with tip per person.  Food Quality: Good to great.  Surprisingly, sushi was not the highlight of our meal, although tuna roll was above average.  Highlights included the an appetizer special, a Lobster muffin dish, as well as the Shrimp and Grits main entree.  One miss -- the Yellotwail Jalepeno appetizer special -- usually a favorite of mine left something to be desired, presentation was strange and definitely not designed to be shared (one large round cake).  Service: Very good.  Our waitress, Cheryl, was very pleasant and good at helping us decide items across the board (Saki, entrees, sushi) without being overintrusive or rude.  When to return:  I'd say summertime on patio, particular for a date or a 2-4 person visit.  This type of restaurant not my favorite for a large group of people.  Last, I wouldn't hesitate to bring a non-sushi lover here since given the wide range of cooked high quality meals."}
{"text":"Parallax has been a sushi mainstay for years in Tremont, due in no small part to their popular half-price Mondays. But any night of the week will work if you appreciate creative combinations and exciting pairings; this place has some of the most uniquely flavorful  sushi in Cleveland.  An extensive wine list and sleek decor give this restaurant a downtown feel.  This place gets busy, with perhaps a bit too many tables, so be prepared for tight spaces and pretty faces...but if you don't mind close quarters, the cuisine and service will impress and delight."}
{"text":"I really don't have any gripes with the place, but on the other hand I can't think of anything that wow'ed me either. Service and food were good. It's sushi, you really can't mess that up too much."}
{"text":"We have been to parallax several times for happy hour. We usually try to reserve a booth in the bar in area. The service is always great and the food always meets our expectations. We have only eaten in the main dining area once but it would be good for a casual dinner or for a date night. They do have a sushi night where all sushi is half off."}
{"text":"Went to Parallax because of rating on Yelp today. Today's also The Indian's Opening Day. My boyfriend and I figured that a nice restaurant in Tremont would be away from the drunk fans.  We were seated professionally, but the menu was weird. Seriously, who puts their menu on a clip board? We were excited though, a dedicated water and bread guy! This gave us hope that we'd get decent service.   The host then seats 6 drunk Indians fans right next to us in a nearly empty restaurant. A host should never seat a bunch of drunks next to a younger couple.  It took a minute getting used to the menu and I was disappointed- almost everything was either seafood or fish. I don't eat either. The waitress came quickly enough at first, but since we didn't know what we wanted she left. Then she was no where to be found. While waiting, I got a bleeding papercut!  We ordered, I told her I needed a bandaid, and then I saw it. The \"bread guy\" was cutting the bread with his bare hands! This is unacceptable. When the host brought me a bandaid, I told him that the bread guy needs to use a glove. He told me that they were not required to use gloves. Then he asked me what I wanted him to do. Really? I want you to follow Sanitation 101 rules! I was previously certified in sanitation from a former career in food service management. I know ANY food that already cooked (or served raw) should not be touched by bare hands.  Anyways, when the duck we ordered came to the table, the presentation was sloppy. It was like they dumped everything into the plate and then wiped the edge. The bok choy was over grilled and the rice was soggy and over cooked. The duck was alright- it wasn't greasy- but it was over cooked.   After the first check back (5 minutes- good timing), the waitress disappeared. It wasn't until was were completely done that she came back. I had to ask her to box my food because she didn't offer. She tried to sell us on something more and kept trying. She finally brought us the check. We paid as quickly as possible and left.   I'm sorry, but for a $50 check, I expect better service than I receive at IHOP. Sadly, I didn't get it."}
{"text":"Have been going there for lunch since they started lunch service.  My last visit will be my last visit.  They downsized the sashimi salad (by approximately 50%), but of course not the price.  However, the worst part is the fish was not fresh.  Our waitress was very nice and tried to be accommodating, but my lunch companion was finished eating before anyone came around to see if I wanted a replacement."}
{"text":"Been ordering the tempura fried lobster since 2011 and have never been disappointed until recently. It seemed to be fried in a different type of oil that made it soggy. I sent an email to inquire and never received a response. This experience combined with the failure to respond on such a high priced item garners a 3 star rating rather than the 5 I would have given it prior to this visit.   Oh and our server informed me that the piece of plastic I thought I bit down on in the calamari was actually cartilage (insert side eye). We were given another batch and it was delicious.   A simple email back acknowledging a cooking oil change or an apology for a bad night would have been reassuring. Now I am skeptical about coming back to try it again."}
{"text":"I hit Parallax with a number of colleagues a couple weeks back.  Good place with a very efficient and hip decor.  I didn't get to try the Sushi, but the more Bistro-esque fare was more than competent, exciting the tastebuds and eyes to boot.    It wasn't enough to blow my mind, but I'd definitely come back for more.  I liked the small plates more than the entrees we got."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Zack Bruell's style. The interior is very modern and clean -- not too many distractions and good for dates. :)  The sushi is fresh but not mindblowing. I had the Costa Rican King Klip, which flavored well and cooked well. (Not overdone at all.) The fish was also very fresh.  The one issue I had was with the menu -- it's a bunch of papers on a clipboard (I think) and that makes it hard to navigate.   Service went well for the two of us -- Bruell's restaurant always makes it a point to always have your water glass never fall below half-empty and to always have a piece of bread on your plate."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim after a date picked the place. The service was great. The waiter was business like with a dab of humor and wit to match the atmosphere. His suggestions were laced with sound reasoning while managing to avoid bashing another choice.  I had the pork shoulder dumplings with mustard greens and pickled onions. We sat near the kitchen and I was able to see them preparing the food which was strangely comforting to me. The food was out quickly and the broth immediately filled my nose with pleasant aroma. The dish simply came together in an amazing fashion. The broth which was somewhat pungent cut the fattiness of the pork shoulder and arrived at a somewhat asian barbecue-esque note. The crunch of the mustard greens and pickled onions gave the dish some much needed texture and the greens, in particular, held on to the broth to help balance each bite.   The environment is somewhat unique. On this particular night, we found the place loosely littered with young professionals (us included? What is \"young\" these days?) that are enjoying the night. Typical, yet...not. I don't have much more time for the review right now, but if you get a chance, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went there last night w boyfriend for happy hour.   Service was first class, and the atmosphere was modern, simple, and classy. Definately someplace you wouldn't look crazy for wearing a cocktail dress. Lots of business professionals coming in before dinner.  Sake on draft came in these lovely little bottles that seemed to be endless once poured in the heavy ceramic black bottle and served so politely in little black ceramic cups.   He was so happy with this place, from the decor to the food. I was happy, but if I go I'll get something other than the burger. (I know. I got a burger. Its my own damn fault.) It was good, and the sauce was delicious, but I was totally jealous of my boyfriend's pork belly and spicy salmon sushi (super filled with fish and tasty as f). Plus it came with frites, which I as assuming was a trendy way of saying fries and was expecting just that but it game with fries cut so thinly (think shoestring onions) that it was kinda weird to eat. Not very substantial, and definitely not a good first date food. I looked so goofy shoving them in my mouth. They were great for picking at once the sake kicked it, however!  Complementary wasabi peas were a nice touch. Also ordered the oysters which were great, yet pricey.   Saw a girl who came in after us get sushi and potstickers. I'll definitely do that next time, or we'll just come on Monday for their half priced sushi because it's bomb!"}
{"text":"Great service, too notch. This place has not changed since we were here last time. Few hiccups in our order but was fixed promptly (but it was probably more to miscommunication, ie, my wife didn't realize that her sushi would be breaded, but was immediately fixed by the kitchen). Duck confit is best in the city, just unreal! Gazpacho was ok, parfait was ok, otherwise, great experience. Our server was attentive. (One recommendation to the restaurant - have your servers talk about that Bruell tour, ours didn't mention it, but it's no big deal). So great job, keep it up"}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant has been categorized \"Thai\" but it is the best seafood I've had in Cleveland since I moved here in 2003.   Great Service.  Great Food.  And an Aesthetically Pleasing Bar (both the drinks and the patrons).  A good place to go when you want to be chic in Cleveland.  Put on a black blazer (for the men) and a fun, colorful dress (for the women) and just have a good time."}
{"text":"Well, it seems parallax really needs to figure out that the reservation system should be a bit more aligned with the time in which one expects to be seated (8:30 reservation typically does not mean 9:10 seating in Cleveland). Also, I should have just said that I'd like the dish of fancy salt on my table as my entree, because it would have been complimentary and that's what I ended up receiving in lieu of the udon noodle order anyhow. Also, if you order a bottle of wine and it's not sitting on your table, then your waiter should be Johnny on the spot refilling those glasses. Alas. Underwhelmed, indeed."}
{"text":"Got there at about 8 on a Friday night and barely beat the crowd and got two spots at the bar. We got the Fried Green Tomato Stack with pork belly, pimento cheese and sweet corn vinaigrette to start. It was alright. I wouldn't recommend it. Then we got a spider roll which I didn't really like and a spicy salmon roll which I really liked. I also got a drink that was way too sweet and would have been way better with some salt on the rim or something. It was really loud and cramped feeling. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Good, but not as good as some of Bruell's other restaurants.  If you're big on fish, this is your place but if you're not in the mood (or don't eat fish like another reviewer who posted about his restaurant) then I suggest you take a good look at the menu before you go."}
{"text":"Is there a better restaurant in the Land ... Goat cheese salad unbelievable!!!   Ok possibly the best meal I've had in a year .. Hanger steak with a ridiculous marinade and green bean tempura .. Thanks Zach!!   Btw Misty from NYC ... Awesome service!!! Thanks Misty!"}
{"text":"A modern and warm restaurant specializing in seafood and sushi. I was here as part of a corporate dinner event and they sat the 35 of us on the back patio, which I can imagine being really cute in the warmer months when the doors are up. There's a lot of rope lighting, dried grasses, and exposed wood.   The menu for us was a set prix fixe with ceasar or mixed green salad, the pork chop/salmon/cobia/chicken, and the cheesecake or chocolate torte. The salads were rudimentary - I had literally a plate of barely dressed mixed greens. No tomato, cucumber, etc. Just. Greens. The cobia (a white fish) was inconsistently prepared across the various diners which made me wonder how it was suppoed to really taste like. The flavor combination (creamed corn, chile oil, and a light teriyaki sear) was okay, but didn't strike me as particularly synergistic. The chocolate cake was overly decadent - not a single person finished the whole thing. It was tasty, yes, but please portion control us! Overall, good food, but nothing to write home about.   Service was rushed and brisque. I know serving a crowd is harrowing, but please don't bark at us. A smile wouldn't hurt you either. I can't comment on value as it was for a corporate event, but the fact that they can accomodate 35 in a private room does give you some sort of kudos."}
{"text":"Usuaully a 4 star+, but the swordfish came out way to watery and the creamed corn was a mess, oil all over the plate too."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for a late night dinner on a Friday night. We were dressed very casually because we didn't want to wait an hour wait at Southside so this place seemed fairly close. So much classier and fancier place. Whoa - i felt so under-dressed. Great place to bring a date or double date because it's sort of like a candle lit dinner type of thing.   My friend was super hungry so he had to really chow down their bread. In some restaurants I've been to, their bread is warm and soft but the ones from here were rock hard. I felt like I was eating cardboard. They were stale and dry. Their menu is a mix of American and Japanese I think because I remember sushi being an option for dinner. I ordered their seaweed salad plus a roll. The roll wasn't the best and not really a WOW factor for me. My other friend Teri W said they have really good drinks here so I'll come back for that but food, I'll skip you.   Other than that, the service was good and they do have a sun room out in the back."}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the tuna, sushi was alright (not the best I have ever had, but good).  Ok service. Very busy on a Friday night.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. Their sushi is very good, up to par with most high quality Japanese restaurants. I had a Mahi Mahi entre special. It was pan seared to perfection and the quinoa salad it came with was spectacular. The salad had onions and shiitake mushrooms. I used to have a shiitake mushroom farm in my apartament and I always enjoyed them by themselves, sometimes raw. The mix in the salad was very different, my brain kept telling me the flavors don't go together, but my tastebuds kept firing with the perfect mix of flavors, tangy, salty, and something else. It went great with the seared Mahi Mahi."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was great! Had the bloody bourbon I think it was called, excellent, but def has quite the kick with Makers Mark being the base. Dragon rolls and spicy salmon rolls were excellent. The spicy salmon rolls weren't spicy at all, so if that's the only reason you wouldn't consider it I would recommend trying! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 on Saturday night. We started off by sitting in the back room with the doors opened on a beautiful evening. The table next to is asked to close the doors but we wanted them open so they moved the other two customers to the other room which was very nice. We appreciated that very much. With that being said our server may have been overwhelmed with   The amount of big tables in the back but we would order our drinks and he would be back from 20-30 minutes and bring other things and we would repeatedly ask where are drinks were and he would say \" don't worry we are working on it.\" Luckily our friends were are pretty relaxed and having a great time or they would have noticed more. I only noticed because I am pregnant and can't drink :-)  We ordered two appetizers : the chicken lettuce wraps and short rib pot stickers. Both were great. Everyone ordered salads and loved them.  For dinner most of the table had sushi but I ordered the Loup De Mer without the rice and sub asparagus. It was fantastic. Other dishes ordered were the pork chops, udon noodles and the perch. Everyone enjoyed there meal !!!!!  The server at the end of the night had no problem taking all five credit cards and splitting it up evenly !  Loved The food and hope the next time to come when I deliver this baby and have the drink the Cleveland mule !"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant.  It's always good.  If you go get the lobster role, or the pei king chicken.  Or really anything, I've never gone wrong at parralax."}
{"text":"Wow. The beef in this dish was amazing (Korean beef). Tender, flavorful, savory, amazing.  I appreciate the chef's creativity and pairing pickled vegetables with a savory gravy in this dish. 1 or 2 of the vegetables I didn't like come but the others were perfect for me. Very good, both the waitress and the manager were checking up on our table regularly. It's a good atmosphere for a meal.  At lunch time on a week day mostly business meetings.  There's a small outdoor patio space also."}
{"text":"My parents, wife and I had a wonderful experience at Parallax in Tremont.  Our server was friendly, funny and had a great deal of patience to help guide us through all the great choices on the menu.  Often times fusion restaurants are reaching in the combinations, but Parallax's are sublime.   I had delicious udon noodles that had just the right amount of spice, and the pork belly in them was cooked perfectly.  The best dish was the Tuna steak that my wife ordered.  I swear that was the best ahi tuna we have ever tasted away from a tropical island. We also enjoyed the edamame, short-rib pot-stickers and a couple of their unique sushi rolls.  All were excellent.  We will be returning to Parallax for special occasions in the future."}
{"text":"Set in the rustic Tremont neighborhood, this is yet another succesful culinary imagining of Cleveland's own Zach Bruell. The flavor profile is Asian yet with a hint of French and New American.  I ordered grouper cheek off the specials menu because anything with the word \"cheek\" on it, should be ordered. AND whenever any Zach Bruell menu features any crispy form of pork, order that too!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. Great service, decent wine list. We had seared tuna, pork tenderloin, lobster rolls, sashimi, potato pancakes and broiled Skate. Everyone liked their dishes except the skate. It was watery and had very little flavor.  But other than that it was very good. I would go again and recommend to anyone in the area looking for good sushi and seafood."}
{"text":"Came here for a date after being recommended by a friend for their \"great\" sushi. We were seated quickly and the server took our drink orders right away. We ordered the rainbow, green dragon, and spider roll. Each roll arrived on separate plates. I believe they were all 6-8 pieces. Anyhow all the rolls seemed to be made hastily, even though the dining room was not busy. The rolls were not wrapped tight enough. The sushi was average for its freshness and taste. The rainbow roll was topped with salmon, tuna, yellow tail and shrimp. The green dragon roll and spider roll were both crunchy but nothing amazing. I would say the green dragon was the best roll out of the three. The crab salad that's on top complements the crunchiness of the tempura shrimp. All in all, I did expect more considering the prices for these rolls.   Will definitely make another visit to Parallax, but not for it's sushi."}
{"text":"We choose this restaurant for dinner one night because i wanted sushi but, my girlfriend doesn't eat it. So we needed a restaurant that had both a full menu and sushi to accommodate both of us. Sushi was very good, typical prices and she had the salmon which she said was good. All in all i would recommend this place but, it is a little pricey...very up scale."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi and sashimi in the city, hands down. Great happy hour. The potstickers and crab croquette are phenomenal.   May be one of the worst burger and frites I've ever had. Beyond that can't complain."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good especially the veggie roll.  The glass of champagne complimented the meal quite well.  Definitely pricey but I would return"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi but to tell you the truth they really rob you on it. The Fried Scallop roll is pretty big, but the probably on use 2 scallops and it was $20. I know it's upscale and all, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a quiet Thursday.  Drinks were excellent (great dirty martini). Duck confit wonderful. Meat tender and flavorful - fell right off the bone. Accompanied by a perfect risotto and green beans cooked perfectly.  Sushi quite good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not to justify the price.  I'm very familiar with Asian food and there were a few things that just didn't taste right to me. The rice was very watery and the sushi tasted as though I could have bought it from the grocery store. The Kalbi was good, but I could have gotten it from a Korean restaurant a few miles away for cheaper. (I noticed that this item is no longer on the menu...)   Do not get me wrong, I love Zack Bruell's food, but this restaurant is not the one to go to if you want to experience his genius.  Lesson learned: The food here is good, but not good enough. The chefs do not cook as though they know their genre."}
{"text":"the menu caters to everyone and everything on the menu is wonderful. i had my 30th birthday dinner and had 20 of my closest friends there a couple of years ago and i go back all the time because it is consistently on point. service is great, bartender makes it even better"}
{"text":"So much is spot on here:   Food, service, friendliness - a lot of thought went into this business and you can tell much effort is invested to maintain it.   Kudos to the team for pulling so much off so well.   (The only distractors are the claustrophobic seating and the cliche and/or tortured desserts)."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their sushi is so good! My favorite being the futomaki, philly rolls, spicy tuna... Heck, all of them! Their parallax burger is very yummy along with the frites! Great spot right in the heart of Tremont!"}
{"text":"Went here for my 10th anniversary and I loved everything about my experience. Service was a bit slow to start but turned out just fine. We sat in the very back enclosed patio and it was so cute with the lights. Food was great! And my pear martini was the best I have ever had! We will be back."}
{"text":"Good food; however, I think they are trying too hard.  I don't know what type of cuisine they are going for.  The interior looks like a sushi bar, but the menu is a variety of Asian \"infused\" influences with some sushi.  It is not a bad place to check out, but I wouldn't be a regular here."}
{"text":"Listen here, Parallax. I'm in love your food, but my paycheck does not allow me to frequent places of your caliber often. So, if you could please stop being so damn good, I'd greatly appreciate it.  These cravings are getting way out of hand.   My first visit ever to Parallax was on my first date with Jason over a year ago.  That's a whole different story in itself and a funny one at that. So, for my review, I'll focus on my most recent trip there just this past week. At least I didn't embarrass myself this time around...   Anyways, I met some friends for a late dinner here and it was wonderful, as usual. The decor and vibe of Parallax is part of what makes it so appealing. You kind of feel like you're at some posh resty in NYC, but you still have that down-to-earth feeling of Cleveland.  The menu is extensive and a little annoying to look at. It comes to you on a clipboard of sorts with the pages loosely tucked in. I prefer to take them out completely and just leaf through the pages. Yes, pages. This menu is ginormous, but only over-whelming due to the mass quantity of delectable items to choose from!   Everyone at the table got something different, but the ladies and I choose a rainbow roll to share for an appetizer. The fish was so fresh and the flavors blended perfectly. I hate it when you taste just the seaweed or fish in a roll. Then I ordered the perfectly seared scallops with spoon cornbread and spicy pepper sauce.  The waiter, who was wonderful BTW, even offered to let me make substitute the mashed potatoes. I opted to keep the dish as it was and my GOD, was it divine!   All in all, my experiences are always phenomenal at Parallax. I'm pretty sure you could pick almost any item off their menu and you'd be more than pleased. I just can't afford to eat like this very often! But, it's the perfect place to go for a celebratory meal or to treat your sweetheart to a special night out.   Sidenote: Bring cash for valet parking unless you find a spot on the street somewhere for free!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent BUT our WAITRESS was even BETTER! She was so sweet. So attentive and very knowledgeable of all their dishes. Me and my friend asked a lot of questions and she never got frustrated she just kept giving us different suggestions. Her name was Janelle and she was awesome! I will be returning for the food and the staff!"}
{"text":"So far, the best sushi I've had in Cleveland in terms of fish and rice quality. Came here for happy hour and only tried food off the bar menu. We had a tuna roll, fried green beans and calamari. The calamari was my favorite- it came with a sweet thai chili sauce as well as marinara. I also had a pinot grigio (it was delicious) and my boyfriend had a beer. Prices were very fair for the amount of food we got. Ambiance was classy modern and all of the house staff were friendly and attentive. They were playing 70's funk which was weird but, i didn't hate it.  Will definitely come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, atmosphere was nice.   This is a fancy froo froo shee shee type place, which is just fine every once in a while. Perhaps I'm not the ideal clientele, I don't mind paying for great food but I'd like to be getting a moderate sized portion. I just don't want to leave feeling hungry, which is what happened.   Having said that though, the actual dishes were great presentation, very flavorful, just not at all plentiful. The goat cheese salad had some tasty elements; in the center a perfectly fried ball of goat cheese surrounded by various greens and dressing. The only negative thing I'll say is that with the bitterness of the radishes it would have balanced the dish better with a sweetness element, which they did some of with the candied nuts. The bitterness was a bit overpowering.  I also had the spider roll which was delicious softshell crab sushi but again just about 4 pieces for $15. Lastly I added the latin cream corn, wonderful blend of corn, onions, scallions, cream.   All told a bit of a pricey meal (which is perfectly fine), fine cuisine overall, but just not enough quantity on the plate. I think there's a fine balance between too much and too little, I understand that fine dining isn't a Golden Corral but there's a better balance to be had here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Good: * Chic, laid-back atmosphere * Our server was sassy.  We liked her.   * Good wine recommendations. * I think I came out ahead with the best dish of the night: a melt-in-your-mouth Alaskan black cod.   * My vegetarian friend was blown away by her tofu entree (she called it the \"Best Tofu I've EVER Had\").  Bad (or to be aware): * Kinda loud.  We didn't have any problems talking but it's not the place for a quiet, romantic meal. * Elbow-to-elbow crowded * Two of my friends ordered the salmon and avocado/crab dish.  The salmon with ponzu sauce was quite tasty (I tried it) but the avocado/crab was just too much - it's crab stuffed in an avocado that's then breaded and fried.  Just... too much. * Mojitos were not very good.  I'd stay away from the mixed drinks here. * Warning to the vegetarians, the vegetarian selection is very limited.  There's only one vegetarian entree, although you can peruse the salads and appetizers for more options.    If my budget allows, I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm often asked what my favorite restaurant in town is - and Parallax is always on the list! What a GEM!   Our last visit was the best yet.  Everything we had was amazing.  With each bite we both kept saying, \"Oh my word, this is delicious!\"  We cleaned our plates in appetizers, sushi, and desert.    Our game plan:  Short Rib Pot Stickers - delicious and oddly light!  Grilled Broccoli Salad - I love Broccoli, and this brought broccoli to a whole new place.    Philly Role - Smoked Salmon, Creme Cheese and Avocado - done!  Surf and Turf - Combination of Lobster role and Steak role.  We were excited for the Lobster role (which was good), but the Steak was the surprise winner of the evening.  It's rare steak with a cheese sauce, sauteed peppers and onions.  Strange sushi idea, but truly amazing.    Dessert was the perfect ending. We had the Walnut Torte and the Chocolate Truffle Cake.  Thank you Parallax for a truly amazing evening!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I am sure ya'll are gonna hate on me for only giving three stars, but I just didn't think it was an outstanding experience. Details:  Five of us arrived on a Monday night for their half-price sushi. Everyone loved their sushi except for me. To be fair, I only eat things like smoked salmon, tempura fried, crab stick stuff so don't listen to me if you're big on slices of raw fish and seaweed salad, we do not have the same tastes. I just felt like what I got was underwhelming (Tempura Futomak $10.50, Dragon Roll $7, Spicy Salmon $4.50). Now I did enjoy the fried calamari and Pork Belly $11 appetizers.   Our server, I think her name was Opal? did an awesome job with being friendly, informative, and timely. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or just a classy chill night having dinner with friends. For parking I got a free spot on the street just a couple minutes walk away.   Now since I wasn't that thrilled with my sushi I did order the Croque Monsieur to-go against the advice of my server. But when I got around to eating this I thought it was great! Just goes to show you can't always rely on the opinions of others. The matchstick looking fries weren't the best but that sandwich was very tasty.   Overall I would give this place another shot. I'd like to try out their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Oh Parallax, how I have missed you.  Whether I was in the mood for sushi, or just some yummy seafood (Scallops, yum!) you never disappointed.  Great drinks, wine, food and service makes this a must try for those who have not even gone there.    The White tuna is absolutely amazing... and I can honestly say I am not one to stray too much from my normal sushi choices, but I have done so at Parallax and was never disappointed.  Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had!    Keep up the great work.  I know Michael Symon gets a lot of the cred in NE Ohio, but I think Zack Bruell deserves just as much with gems like this and L'Albatros."}
{"text":"Unexpected great sushi place in Cleveland. Everything was fresh and the service was excellent even though they were starting to get busy being short staffed. If you don't come for the half priced sushi at least come for Opal! She was so attentive, made us laugh, and gave great recommendations for just spending a night in Cleveland. Also, great happy hour drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was very personable, and I love the general feel of the place as well as decorations. Would definitely recommend the green dragon roll and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal and prepared with great care .  Atmosphere is great, wait staff nice and not pushy.  Been here several times and it has NEVER disappointed!  Vegetarian and other request friendly, with several vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"I have tried Parallax three times now and it is the worst sushi I have had in cleveland. The appetizers were great but skip the sushi if you go."}
{"text":"Great food, possibly my favorite seafood in Cleveland. The entrees are excellent. The nigiri is great. Service is hit or miss. Love the host - he's the best, always! Have had some good servers (generally on the weekends) and some not-that-awesome servers and bus boys (a bit too aggressive and nervous sometimes). Overall though, nothing that would keep me away.   My ONLY real complaint (and I really hope someone at the restaurant reads this) is that the chopsticks are **terrible**!!!! I was so surprised when, after ordering a $25 entree, I was given the cheapest chopsticks (chinese takeout style). I've had to ask for additional pairs more times than I can imagine, as they are horrible quality and tend to splinter into your fingers, food, or mouth. If the management could manage to purchase good (or not even good, decent!) quality chopsticks then I would certainly be giving this restaurant 5 bright stars!"}
{"text":"Sarah Sarich dined with me (Cleveland taster) with a couple girls. We felt the vibe was very San Francisco and city-like. The service was sub-par and the waiter  left mid sentence on a couple occasions. Overall the food was great with dim lighting just a heads up that the service isn't up to par."}
{"text":"I went here for their happy hour the other week with a friend and loved it! When I got there the bar was packed so I was lucky to get 2 seats together. We ordered the tempura green beans as an app thinking this was semi-healthier than the other food options (even though it is fried, we know). The order came out and was HUGE! We didn't think we'd finish it but these were so addicting and might have been one of the best things I ever ordered. The perfect mix of salty and a little sweet so we finished the order. We then each got a California roll which was great. The staff was very friendly too, they even charged my phone because it died and I was waiting for a friend to get there and had no way to contact them so this was really nice of them to do. Their regular menu looked so good too, but a little pricey. I saw that they have 1/2 price sushi on Monday's so this seems like a great deal."}
{"text":"Corner restaurant in artsy residential neighborhood.  Valet parking available but we found street parking ourselves. Our waiter David provided excellent service and is very knowledgeable about the menu.    I enjoyed the beet salad with dressing on the side; the beets were accompanied by spinach leaves, fennel and fresh orange slices.  The dressing was citrusy and tasty but a tad acidic.  Enjoyed the fresh salmon sushi (nigiri) accompanied by a delightfully strong pickled ginger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a great night here last Friday.  We had dinner reservations for 8:30, but wanted to get a drink somewhere in the neighborhood before.  After trying a few local bars and seeing them all packed, we decided to come sit at the bar at Parallax until our table was ready.  I was actually really glad it worked out this way, the bar was really nice, elegant and trendy but warm and inviting at the same time.  There are not a lot of spots in Cleveland with this feel.    The bartenders were great as we ordered a couple of glasses of wine and a roll of sushi to try. As others have mentioned, the sushi here is nothing to be impressed by.  Its 3 stars, probably less if we were in NYC. Great wine list though, and great service. We moved to our table afterwards and ordered the Pork Belly salad with green apple, kale and spiced pecans to start off.  It wasn't mindblowing (you may wonder what salad is, but that just means you haven't yet heeded my advice at Giovanni's), but it was definitely good.  For entrees, BF had the Seafood Stew which comes in a different broth each day, that night it was green curry and it was excellent. And again as others have mentioned, they don't skimp at all with the seafood.  I ordered the Roasted Flounder entree which was made really well too- I enjoyed it, but it didn't leave me wanting more.  Meanwhile, the server was very attentive, knowledgeable, and kept bringing us more of their warm, delicious bread.  Overall, we had a really great time here.  It's definitely one of our favorite Bruell restaurants now (right after L'albatros and Cowell and Hubbard). I'm looking forward to coming back, and the large menu and the fact that it changes every few months will make sure of that!"}
{"text":"After much debate, I decided to review this place based on the food, and not on our waiter.   To start, our waiter messed up our bill BIG TIME and charged all of us twice and also made us wait a full hour before \"sorting\" our bills out. we were til until way past after the restaurant closed because of him.   After that short vent, I loved this restaurant. I came to Parallax for Zack Bruell's Restaurant Week so we had a 3 course menu. I ordered duck confit spring rolls, lemongrass noodles, and ginger creme brulee. In addition, i tried the sushi, trout, tiramisu, and banana foster. Now for the one by one review:   Duck confit spring rolls (5): yum! the one thing i always worry about when ordering duck is, how much will duck meat will the chef really give me? and this spring roll had a great amount of duck. The spring roll wrap was also very crispy and the flavors were right there.  Sushi (3): The sushi was good, but there wasn't a real WOW factor to it that I was hoping to get from the duck confit spring roll. It was tasty though!  Lemongrass Noodles (3.5): The noodles was soooooo delicious and almost tasted like it was hand made noodles. The broth of the lemongrass noodles was very very flavorful, but a tad bit salty. Then, all the pot roast and crab meat on the noodles just really bring it up a notch. The only sad part was.... I wasn't able to eat the broth itself because it was soooo salty and there was probably only about 5 noodles in my dish so after I was done eating the noodles, I felt like my delicious broth was left to waste because my palette couldn't take all the salt added to it.  Trout (4): i was impressed with the amount of trout given to us for this dish. There was 4 trouts (guessed how i felt after seeing my lemongrass noodles only had 4 little noodles), a bunch of rice and a bunch of every bit of awesomeness. The trout had a crunchiness to the fish skin that I really like, and it was just so worth it.   Ginger Creme Brulee (3): I'm harsh when it comes to creme brulee only because I'm not huge on sweets, but i ADORE creme brulee. I will order it at every restaurant I go to. WIth that said, the ginger creme brulee was great and it had just the right hint of gingerness in it. However, the carmelized sugar was a bit too thick for me and it was killing my teeth to bit through all that sugar.  Other than that, it was a great creme brulee.  Banana Foster (4): YUM YUM YUM! First, if you want GREAT banana foster, go to velvet tango room. Otherwise, Parallax's isn't bit either! The little bit of tart in the banana complemented the ice cream... made the banana almost taste like plantains.  Tiramisu (3): meh. It was a good dessert, but not one i'd choose over the creme brulee or the banana foster. The tiramisu for my tasting, wasn't soft enough. The good thing, Parallax gave a BIG amount of it! :D   Overall (4): Zack Bruell, I'm slowly becoming a fan of yours! You were at Parallax during my dining experience, overseeing the employees. (A) I wish you came to our table to say hello because I would've loved to meet you and (B) I wish you stayed til our entire dining experience to better help out with the troublesome waiter.... or maybe give us a free meal for our 1 hour wait for our bill.  Parallax, I will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We started by going to happy hour on a Friday night around 630. The bar was decently crowded but we were able to find two spots at the bar. We tried the hanger steak potstickers and spicy tuna roll, both were delicious. We then had dinner, hanger steak and peanut crusted trout both were excellent."}
{"text":"Disappointed would be an understatement. Went last night prior to rock hall of fame induction.  Service was excellent and attentive and decor trendy.  Food was generally bland and uninspired. Expected a top shelf food experience based on reviews and was really let down.  Good news is that it wasn't overly expensive"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive!! The sushi is delicious and the drinks are Devine! Worth the price, would definitely go back to experience new dishes on the menu"}
{"text":"Zack Bruell hit it on the head . Love the atmosphere . The menu is always changing and everytime I find something superb. If you are looking for just a Sushi place then move on, although the sushi is great look further and try the seafood stew which is always a hit. Parallax hooch has to be one of the best drinks I have every tried . It has a fresh , clean , mint w a hint of spice flavor . Even though it wasnt on the lastest menu the bar made it perfect !! I would recommend this for a trendy , fun datenight ."}
{"text":"A little pricey but I love their food. It's nice that they offer sushi as well as other things for those who aren't sushi/Asian food fans. Servers are always very nice. Parking is difficult so expect to valet."}
{"text":"I know Parallax has such good reviews, so I was expecting a little better. My friend wanted to have sushi, but I wasnt in the mood since I just had my fill on Friday at Ginko. I knew that they would have some non-sushi items, because it's a \"fusion\" restaurant, so it seemed like the perfect in-between choice.   It's a nice fancy restaurant. Very trendy. Sat at the bar for happy hour. I started off with a \"beet-up\" martini. Sounded interesting, and I like beets, so why not give it a try? It was ok. Definitely tasted like beets to me, but not something I would get again. I appreciate the creativity, but I'll just stick to beets in my salads from now on.   I ordered the Parallax burger, which came with a huge mound of shoe-string fries. HUGE. I barely ate them. The burger was good. Came with bacon, and a side of thousand island dressing. My friend ordered spicy tuna rolls and a pineapple-coconut mussel app. The mussels were tasty! It didn't sound too great at first, so I was pleasantly surprised.   I got some food to-go for my other half. I ordered the potstickers and the chicken liver saute w/ dirty rice. I just tasted the rice and I thought it was a little mushy, but interesting flavor. He called it \"livery.\" The potstickers were deep-fried, and filled with short-rib meat. I didn't taste these, but he wasn't a big fan. I was surprised to find that they were deep-fried because they're called POTSTICKERS for a reason, right? Because when you make them, they should be sticking to the pot, not thrown in the deep fryer! Eh, minor details.   I know they are most known for their sushi, which the hostess said is \"really good.\" But the prices are up there for sure. Ginko is a better deal and you get awesome, authentic sushi. I also noted other Japanese dishes like udon were the priciest I've ever seen....c'mon who wants to pay $20 for a bowl of rice noodles? you can get this at another Japanese restaurant for about half that. I don't think I'm inclined to return."}

The angular amount of this in a particular case, esp. that of a star viewed from different points in the earth's orbit. ***** It has been a long time since I sat sat down and really wrote an exceptional review.  I must admit that I have taken a sharper eye to service, taste, presentation, cleanliness, since becoming elite.  The experience at Parallax was amazing, beautiful, cool and delicious.    It was a business dinner for a party of 3, yet the company was great, mostly due to the food.  The menu is rich and plentiful, proving that sushi IS American by now.  Simple, classic rolls with a couple of eye-catching presentations passed our table...  We had reservations and were seated in the second main dining room.  Very artful and innovative, sexy and modern.  As soon as we were seated we were greeted by what turned out to be an awesome, no like really awesome server.  She has been with chef Zack Bruell for 9 years, she grew up with him next door.   She was knowledgeable and gave us a few minutes.  Another server circles the room with a basket full of fresh bread and reloads as many times as you like.  APPS:  Guest 1 started with the corn chowder.  The presentation was gorgeous, I smelled the bacon and apparently it was delicious.   I had a fresh rainbow roll, it was divine.  ENTREES:   Their most popular dish is the Roasted chicken in white wine with pomme frittes.  I was going to go with any FRITTES! I knew dessert was going to be to die for... Guest 1 went with the chicken, I tasted the chicken it was unbelievable.  A tangy yin to the wine yang, and it was juicy and a flavor explosion that made it memorable.  The pile of frittes was a pile on a pile over a pile.  The herb seasoning was amazing.

Instead of his standard snapper or sea bass he went with the Seared sea scallops with yuzu rice cake, cucumber and a beet puree...and I  kicked myself when I even realized it was on the menu! (AND when I tasted it)  Check it:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=27pUYYPxf8i-A-uLMKEjzA&userid=8Gy1MJ4gCnOL8qiwD2ZGLQ  I was trying to be good because all it seems we do on our trips to Ohio is dine oh so fine, so I steered myself in the basic (again dessert was front and center on my mind) but my basic was not Parallax's basic: Seared Ahi Tuna with Thai basil eggplant (omg heaven)lemongrass rice & galangal emulsion.  I was a little concerned with the eggplant situation, but you can always remove slices of eggplant, right... So by the time my dish came, I had all but forgotten about the eggplant... This dish was so good, and i tasted these little bites/chunks of something caramel and earthy... (I always keep a menu by my side so i can refer) booyah, it was the eggplant! wow, that is not the eggplant I knew, no babaganush in this place!  The service was spot on, the server was engaging when we spoke to her and didn't hover one bit.  Not pretensious, just really fully aware of what \"service\" means.  You would think we would pop at this point (did you SEE those pomme frittes?), but the bible states desserts, so, what choice did I have.  Guest 1's birthday was the day after and I hinted it to the server so in all its glory this is what happened.  A big claim to fame is the absinth they serve because of course it will not kill you anymore and Big Doug was insistint I try it.  Why would i say no, right?  So let's try to break it down: Ginger Creme Brulee - it was ok, i was in not in love with the ginger infusion a bit heavy handed, i thought...  Then the absinth  experience was awesome. LUCID: absinthe superieure  was brought out and as if this was brain surgery the performance of its preparation was shown and done with me.  Of course this lunatic didn't need 'much' water while it was poured over the sugar and that drink knocked me so hard, I am not sure if I lost half my brain or gained another half of smarts.  It was insane but good.  Whow, just caught  shiver thinking of that!

{"text":"So finally i was able to push aside all of the pre-school woes and worries to take some time out to try a few new restaurants that have been on the infamous 'list' for a while. I felt that it was of the utmost importance to promptly throw on some heels and make my reservations.  So this place is in Tremont and owned by trendy restaurateur Zack Bruell.  Lets talk atmosphere: First thing coming in we were handed our menus, on metal clipboards, cute! There are two small sections of the restaurant, the bar, which i didn't have too much time to peer into, and the main dining section where we were seated. The decor was chic, elegant, and modern, all tied together with a neutral color scheme, it was all very neo-japan classique. Everything was just peachy; all except for service. It took our waitress probably ten minutes before even asking for our drink orders! Throughout the night we probably saw her a total of... two times. This is to say the restaurant was not even busy... In fact, another waitress noticed that we hadn't been given dessert menus (after asking) for fifteen minutes, brought two over, and then, ten minutes later, had to take our order as well because our waitress had seemingly vanished. I was very un impressed and when push comes to shove, it was rather substandard for a $50 a dinner.   Onto the best part, food. There are certain places where the food is simply much too delicious to be THAT bothered by deplorable service, and this just so happened to fall into that category. I am embarrassed to admit that i sadly passed on an appetizer, earning me disapproving looks from all parties involved. The chef though, did bring me out my Seared Sea Scallops with butternut squash risotto braised radicchio and port-balsamic glaze. Oh. My. Gosh. Scallops; cooked to perfection and the risotto was the exact right compliment. Though not far from form, dessert was what made the meal. My friend settled with a delish lemongrass creme brulee, and i with a buttermilk pound cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a cranberry cherry compote. Ohh man.   I would say definitely check it out, it'd  be a great spot for a date with someone special (...ya'll can with hold the 'but how would she know jokes now') or just with a few friends! Just make sure you find some good parking..."}
{"text":"The food is great, but we waited 35 minutes past out reservation time, and the table was uncomfortably cold and so dark that we had to use cell phone light for the menu! The manager ended up bringing out complementary desserts at the end to makeup for the wait and poor service, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Chef Bruell's other restaurant, L'Albatros, I had high expectations for Parallax. Entering through the floor-to-ceiling glass doors and into the restaurant, I instantly noticed the ambiance and decor were typical Bruell; modern chic, clean lines and minimalist. Would the meal to follow be the same excellence?   The menu is heavily Asian influenced: sushi, sashimi, hand rolls and seafood dominate the menu; of which is presented on loose leaf paper held together by a clipboard. If I didn't cheat and peak at the menu beforehand online, I would've been overwhelmed. There's probably close to 10 pages of appetizers, salads, entrées, sushi's and drinks to shuffle through.   For an appetizer, we both opted for the soup of the day which was a bowl of Lobster Bisque. The soup was probably my favorite part of the meal. Rich in flavor, chunks of lobster meat and a garnish of watercress made this dish.   For entrée,  my accomplice got a variety of sushi consisting of spicy tuna, freshwater eel and lobster. I sampled the spicy tuna and while I'm not nearly the soosh expert as my dining partner, I'm pretty sure this was the best sushi we've had in the great state of Ohio.  I decided to throw the fishy meal for a tailspin and order the Braised Beef Shank and Oxtail with Vietnamese Pho. While I appreciated the well developed flavors and tenderness of the braised beef, the stock was a tad heavy and over-reduced. By the time I got down to the end of the bowl, the broth was so rich and dark, I opted not to finish it completely. Perhaps this was Bruell's own individualistic take on Vietnamese Pho, because it was different than what I'm accustomed to at Superior Pho, but it certainly left room for improvement both in presentation and flavor.   For dessert? We shared a slice of chocolate mousse cake garnished with raspberries and blackberries. No complaints whatsoever. I don't critique desserts as much as the rest of the meal unless it was a stark disappointment. This slice of chocolate was clearly not an afterthought though. Rich in flavor, yet not too heavy on your stomach. A perfect cap to a fine meal.   Overall, I was satisfied, but not blown away. The experience and meal didn't seem to linger in my thoughts as some of the better meals and dining experiences we've shared at other establishments. That to me is the ultimate test of something truly great; when you wake up the next morning, reminiscing of the previous night's meal. That didn't happen with Parallax. Maybe next time. I'm willing to go back. The menu is certainly extensive enough that I'd like to sample something else on the menu. Until then, my culinary voyage throughout Cleveland continues onward......."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever had in my life, easily. I can't remember what the food even tasted like or what I ordered to be honest. Must have blacked that out, all I can remember is thinking \"where is the manager or one of the other employees of this empty restaurant to help this clueless waiter get the check right\" after he messed it up for the 5th time. This was 75 minutes after we were ready to leave the restaurant, at 11pm on a work night. I mean, we had 8 people, but he said splitting the check would not be a problem, and after a half hour we told him just to give us one check and he refused and instead made us wait another 45 minutes. Amazing, really, if you think about it.  Never going back."}
{"text":"5 Stars on a Monday BECAUSEEEEE ---- HALF PRICE SUSHI! The entire sushi menu is half priced which includes apps, sashimi, nigiri, and all sushi rolls! Started with the White Tuna appetizer with a cilantro jalapeño sauce, which was THE BOMB! It was so good that my coworker & I both ordered an additional one (why not - it was half price). I got the Rainbow Roll, but I'm not a fan of California rolls, so they allowed me to substitute the California roll portion for spicy Tuna - which earned an A+++ for both the roll & the substitution allowance. I also got the spicy salmon roll which was also good. The service could be a bit better, but everything else outweighed that. Definitely come here on a Monday night!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal. Highly recommend the squash and goat cheese ravioli appetizer! Our table was near the kitchen, so we could see the head chef finish plating the food, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Based on my experience from going on Monday in which they have half off sushi. At first, I thought it was a sushi place but it's really not, more so Asian. The decor of the place is really nice but if you come with more than 4 people you will probably need to have a reservation to reserve a table. They do have a happy every weekday but it is only at the bar which is not that big. Also the servers are really nice.  Now to the food. All we tried was the sushi because you can't beat half off, which I am glad it was; because I would be mad if I ever paid full price the rolls, which seems pretty expensive to me. I ordered 2 rolls which I didn't really care for. I think it was the texture that I didn't like, they seemed plain and boring to me. One was the spicy salmon roll, which I think needed some crunch to it. The other was the tempura futomaki roll which I just didnt like, and I got it because it was deep fried which I never had a bad experience with. But I doubt I would ever get those rolls again. Especially since I had better at many other places. I also sampled the surf and turf combo roll which is really expensive and not really worth it, the steak was very chewy! Safe to say I prolly won't come back for sushi but maybe all of their other food is worth it."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  My husband and I tried is last night for Cleveland's Restaurant week.  Right away the customer service was superb-the host was personable and checked our coats, the servers were attentive and very helpful, and the food rocked my boots off my feet!  We first split the spicy salmon roll (we couldn't resist trying their sushi) and it was worth it! It was so fresh and melted in our mouths.  I ordered off the fixed menu-butternut squash soup, trout, and apple crisp  a la mode.  Absolutely incredible!    I have two suggestions for Parallax: 1. Warm bread. Bread is usually served first, and first impressions stick.  Warm bread is more appeasing to the senses.  Plus, it would pair excellently with your amazing salt bowl and rich olive oil. *If their is a reason why they don't serve warm bread I'd like to know.   2. (I know I'm showing off my food snob side here, but...) The skin on my trout could have been a tad crispier.  It was crisp on some sides of the skin, but in the middle it was a little under done. Otherwise it was delightful and scrumptious.   If I could rate it. 4.5 I would!  We will be back to see if they take any of my suggestions and of course to try more of their scrumptious delicacies."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not sure what the hype is about. We went here for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant had been open for about an hour, but was still relatively empty. We were seated immediately, bread was brought out, and the waiter explained the menu (SN: Bread was great!). I ended up ordering the salmon and a basic edamame appetizer. The salmon came out quickly, but was sadly a disappointment. The flavor combination should theoretically have worked, but I honestly found the salmon to be underflavored and minimally seasoned. Additionally, the portion size was unreasonably small in my opinion. After eating two pieces of bread, edamame, and the salmon, I was still hungry. I understand that its a lunch portion, but I shouldn't leave hungry.  Overall, I was not impressed and probably would not return. The only things I really enjoyed were the bread and good service."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to get a lot of shit for this based off the 4 stars this place has but I'm going to be honest.  Overall my wife and I were very disappointed with this place. It wasn't just one thing. The service was a train wreck. We sat at the bar with the bartender right in front of us and we were ignored the whole time we were there. When our order came out it was wrong so I had to send it back. I had the steak and it was pretty good tasting. My wife wasn't as lucky. She ordered the scallops with some kind of noodle. The noodles we very undercooked and the scallops were nothing to get excited about. We ended up spending 60 dollars on a very subpar meal. This was our first time here and we almost always give places a second chance however I think we are going to cut our loses with this one. I don't see us wasting our time when the area has so many other options.  I almost never give one star but in this case there just wasn't anything that went well."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a date. The service was great, food was amazing and the drinks were unique. We had the Japanese Udon and the Tofu Udon and they were both delicious. We also had a firecracker and spicy tuna roll as appetizers. For drinks we had the green tea and wasabi martini it was the first time I try it and it was good. For desert we had the cheesecake and an absinthe drink, both were great. After dinner take a lovely walk down the block as we did and get an amazing view of the Downtown Cleveland skyline for selfies and other pics. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. Check out it out at http://parallaxtremont.com"}
{"text":"You know the best thing about visiting Cleveland from New York? The prices.   Parallax has a modern, upscale loungey feel but that's not reflected by the prices. A bottle of very drinkable Gruner Veltliner, two sushi rolls, and some beers came to $50 including a generous tip. Now that's a deal.   On the downside, the sushi was a little mushy."}
{"text":"In a nutshell....  Been here several times  Great food. I have loved everything I've tried.  Sushi was incredible.   Service was awesome   I will go back."}
{"text":"This place has half price sushi on Mondays and the rolls are HUGE.  I ordered 3 rolls and there was no way I was finishing them. Seriously-I've never seen sushi that big. They were all delicious too. My friend and I got there around 7 on a Monday and sat at the bar. The place was kind of crowded but still really quiet and intimate. The women next to me were eating some type of green bean salad that looked amazing also. The bartenders were helpful and quick...I think I spent more on wine than I did on food here that night. The half price sushi is such a deal and I would definitely go back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"While I like the ambience of this restaurant, I was not crazy about the food. The staff are eager to please and very friendly. There were a total of 5 different people who took care of us so that was a little weird. Our server was great, but every time we finished a dish or drink, it seemed someone other than her stopped at table. A little too much for me.   Now for the food, my husband loved his which was a Thai sausage with pesto noodles. I ordered a special, pumpkin gnocchi with chicken. There was not even a hint of pumpkin flavor and the dish was swimming in oil. It had a good taste, but way too greasy."}
{"text":"I've been to Parallax a few times now and have had very mixed experiences.   The host is usually really nice but the servers are very slow and rarely stop by the table.  Most of the times I've been have been Monday's so I come in with a bit lower expectations. But prior to my last visit I'd only had the sushi which has always been great. This time around we got a sushi appetizer, two entrees, a nigiri combo.  The yellowtail sashimi appetizer was great as usual.   I was unimpressed with the hanger steak which could definitely use some work. Compared to other hangers I've had in the city, the dish was lacking flavor and the steak itself was chewy and inconsistently cooked.  The yellowtail nigiri was great unfortunately my second bite of sushi was tuna that was past its prime and tasted almost sour leaving a VERY bad taste in my mouth no amount of the Malbec I had could get rid of. After that I was very off put by the meal as a whole and didn't touch the rest of our sushi.   It was disappointing that after politely bringing up the issue with the sushi nothing was done. I've had far better meals for half the price."}
{"text":"I don't visit places like this very often, I'm frugal with my food (less so with my liquor) but I had a full 'dinner for 2' gift certificate.  Immediately, the perks of such a restaurant like Parallax appeared: coat check, valet parking [$5], a sleek, minimalistic decor. Plastic Chairs, menu came on a metal clipboard. The decor reminded me of a place for Moby's music videos without the vegan options or a somber mood.   Our server was excellent despite the bustling crowd. The tables are placed perhaps a tad too close: I overheard an adjacent table's conversation [and their life stories, admittingly interesting). Excellent service: constantly had our drinks bread refilled without our asking and being very accommodating [with menu items, etc] even though I wasn't the most experienced with these places. The server was also very knowledgeable with the menu and describing its tastes.   So, with food paid for, I ambitiously began a rare night of gluttonary excess.  Mussels: 18 of them, all plump in a nice buttery sauce (with a hint of garlic). I received them so quickly, yet they didn't taste like they were sitting in a heater in the back. House salad [iceberg - not good enough for this place, rightly so]: tasty with the good balsamic vingarette.  Main course: 1.5 pounds of King Alaskan Crab legs. (homer Ssimpson drool...) Pre-cracked. Had a very light lemon taste to them (it's been a year since I last had them, so possibly crab legs normally taste like that) with some green beans and cubed potatoes fried in truffle oil.   There's a large wine selection [though don't know much about, so I'll skip....] they had ten or so beers, all imports and microbrews.  There was also 4-5 specialty cocktails. The champagne julip was crafted with just a hint of lime and mint [and mint leaves, no less] and worth the $10.   A chocolate (light) mousse topped with blackberries and raspberries, a great finale [although I also wonder if it was 'trucked in' from somewhere].   No doubt, it's expensive ($113 after tax, for the 2 of us). However, given the amount and quality of food and drink that we received, it's a very good value. I would definitely go here again if I were a high roller or wanted to impress someone. Deserves to be on the short-list of upper-tier restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night had reservations at 6pm.  When we got there the place was pretty empty a few people at the bar.  We had a very good waiter.  My daughter had been there before and insisted we go and have the hanger steak her favorite.  The menu came on a clip board and looked like allot of work to read after being at work all day looking at the computer and reading papers this was the least thing I wanted to do on a relaxing night out.  Our waiter came buy and was most helpful suggesting drinks and entree's..he suggest a beet martini and figured why not how often am I going to have a chance to try something like that so I ordered that.  I also ordered the tempura vegtables appetizer to share for the table and got the hanger steak and my other daughter order the chicken and everyone else got the hanger steak.  Our appetizer came out quickly and everyone loved it.  My beet martini came out looked like a cosmo but was more sour I enjoyed it but don't think I would get it again.  Our meals were wonderful and the chicken my daughter got was so tasty and juicy almost enjoyed it more than the hanger steak.  The tables are close together but the atomosphere is nice we found parking on the street close to the restaurant when we were ready to leave the place was packed.  I got up and the expediter helped me on with my coat and to my amazement it was Zach, the owner, was in a state of shock at that and wasn't sure if it was really him and then heard someone addressing him by his name.  What a nice touch.  Would definitely return with my husband next time.  Wish I would of talked to Zach Bruell and told him how much we did enjoy our meal but then again he might ready this.  Also work at the Cleveland Clinic and frequent Table 45 another one of his restaurants and found out Table 45 was named after a table at Parallax."}
{"text":"I was taken to this place as a \"surprise\" and we were both excited to try their sushi. We soon realized that their sushi is worse than single-dollar-sign sushi, and this is a 3-dollar-sign place. The salmon and tuna pieces on their Rainbow Roll were dry on the top and had a couple hard edges (from being dried up?). The tuna pieces also had a very stinky fish taste. I had to go to the restroom to spit it out. Huge regret for not ordering their cooked entres, which might have been better based on the buttered escargot appetizer we had."}
{"text":"Parallax introduced me to my second love: swordfish. My first love, you ask? That would be my boyfriend...the one that introduced me to Parallax.  I have been here three times total with one absolute stand-out visit in which I feasted on pure heaven: a swordfish marmalade dish that has yet to appear on the menu since. I even asked about this dish the last time I was there and was saddened (and also excited) to learn that the menu changes frequently. Alas, my prodigal swordfish marmalade has yet to return to my mouth. This dish has forever been etched onto my brain as the most delectably fatty, yet edible, sweet, yet savory, and explosively flavorful without being obscene plate of fish that I have ever consumed. I would give Parallax 5 stars if the other swordfish dish I tried hadn't fallen so flat in comparison. The seared swordfish belly with ginger rice was not nearly as flavorful or cooked quite as well. Similarly, the calamari appetizer was overly oily and just not as finger-licking good as calamari can be. Thus Parallax receives 4 stars from me. But I have hope that lightening will once again strike this Tremont establishment and my beloved swordfish marmalade will make a much awaited reappearance."}
{"text":"We drove here for the Monday sushi special. The server said they don't have that deal anymore but it is on the home page of their website that sushi is half off on Mondays. Be forewarned before you waste your time driving to this place"}
{"text":"While recently in Cleveland for business I was treated to Parallax for my birthday dinner. I had heard many great things about this place and it lived up the hype. We went late on a friday and thanks to a reservation were seated immediately.   We had a large party and ordered a few sushi rolls for appetizers; spider, philly, spicy salmon and rainbow. All of them were very tasty but the spicy salmon was particularly delicious. For dinner I had heard raves about the short ribs and decide to go for it. They lived up to their praise and accompanied by a spicy rice equaled an excellent birthday dinner. We also ordered the battered green beans and pommes frites for sides and both were absolutely delicious.   Being the birthday boy I was treated to the chocolate desert which was a great cap to the meal though I was stuffed enough as is. This is a great little spot in a cool part of the area that I would recommend to anyone visiting or living in the area. Not a cheap meal by any means but a perfect place to spend a night out or celebrate a birthday in this case."}
{"text":"I went here on half price sushi night and had a great experience! First, I have never been so impressed with how much the staff cared about their jobs, and loved working there. From the busser, our server, another serving filling our water and everyone we encountered, they all were in a good mood and worked effortlessly as a team. Management clearly is doing a great job with their staff!   As someone who doesn't eat seafood but loves sushi, I tried the vegetable sushi with crispy onions, jalepanos and mushrooms that was delicious. I had the warm goat cheese salad too, which had a really great mustard dressing. We also split a bottle of wine by recommendation from our server that went well with our meal. They have an extensive menu with something for everybody!"}
{"text":"This is happy hour review only...which was great. The prices weren't an amazing deal but (most of) the food was definitely worth the price. The mussels were the only thing that weren't good and that we didn't finish (and we NEVER leave food behind).   Spicy tuna roll and tempura beams were delicious! Will definitely be back for a regular meal, especially the sushi!"}
{"text":"I don't really believe in Five Stars.  Yet, this Tremont mainstay deserves it for delivering time and time again.  Zack Bruell and his staff continues to amaze me, especially how they all work together as a team and everybody shares responsibility at all levels to provide a great experience, both with the food and delivering an experience.  As Realtors, both my girlfriend and I joked about the size of the menu resembling a real estate contract (BIG).  Many pages and lots of options and our food last night was fantastic (I got the Skirt Steak, my Beautiful Sweetness got the Tuna)  Not enough reasons to substantiate the score you say?  Okay, so when I got there, my Lady was cold and didn't want to be anywhere remotely close to the door and I asked to be moved long after she sat, they did it with a smile and the host made it fun!  Prior to that, the Host told me to check my car so I didn't block the small private drive next door to make sure I didn't have a towing incident.  Mid stream, we decided the glass of wine my Sweetie ordered was SO good, we wanted the bottle so they sold us 4 glasses at the bottle price, long after the 1st glass was poured.  High marks for both the more expensive Cab on their menu and the Predator Zin, their wine list rocks!  Lastly, after explaining how this was an important date night for us since we were going to be apart and me confirming how amazed I am Zack Bruell is one of Clevelands' Best, they offered up their creme brulee which has a crust and filling that almost caused tears of joy...no really, its that amazing!  As matter of fact, I might cry again now!  (Creme Brulee Addiction Support Group forming soon in a neighborhood near you).  Okay, so I will admit I am a bit of perfectionist, have been accused of trying to micro-manage so things go off unhitched.  Here, it was a real treat that on this night, on a snowy day in Cleveland, I got to watch it happen before my eyes and be a part of the pampering!  Of course, having a beautiful woman across from me and some great food and wine...maybe it was all just a mirage..."}
{"text":"Parallax is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Great atmosphere, good location, great food.  My wife absolutely loves the sushi.  I've had the short rib and the pork chop.  The short rib was one of the best meals I've ever had.  The pork chop was delicious also.  My wife and I were dressed kind of casual and didn't feel out of place at all.  Great food in a laid back atmosphere.  It's certainly not cheap, but the price matches the quality and then some.  Watch your drinks if you're looking to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with a friend, only because Southside (across the street) was packed and we both absolutely loved this place.  The ambience was perfect for a conversation, the wait staff was nice and the food was terrific.  I'm not a huge fan of Sushi which they are known for so I ordered the warm goat cheese salad with salmon on it.  It was amazing.  The portion is generous, had to take leftovers home.  Also had a cup of the coconut soup which was delectable.   I'm so very picky about restaurants because I go out so often, about atmosphere and food done right.  These people know how to run a restaurant.  Well done."}
{"text":"Parallax is good.  Yelp description of 3 starts is A-OK, which is exactly what it is.  Good food, not great.  Good atmosphere in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Cleveland, the Tremont district.    Have only had sushi here, so can only speak to that.  It's as good as I've had in my many visits to Cleveland.    Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour at Parallax yesterday.  It was surprisingly open at the bar and we sat down immediately.  The decor is much like Table 45 (Another Bruell place), clean and modern.   Our bartender/server was extremely attentive and answered our every question about the sophisticated menu.  We strongly recommend the \"Corpse # 2\" cocktail, and our bloody Mary was perfectly spicy.  We started with the light and crispy Calimari, probably top 2 in Cleveland.  The short rib pot stickers were absolutely worth a second trip on their own.  The bed of soy infused shredded cabbage below and drizzle of Siracha above the four large stickers really brought out the flavors.  Then our spicy tuna roll arrived and was delicious as well.  The wild card was the chicken livers.  My husband absolutely loved them.  I prefer the more fried approach.  But he really thought the texture, the sauce, and the rhubarb cube thingies (they had a fancy name) were well worth the splurge, even though we were stuffed from our first three selections.  With $2 beers and reasonable cocktail and wine glasses, the food here makes this a cannot miss stop for happy hour.  Another gem in Tremont! We shall return!"}
{"text":"Don't let anyone fool you by saying Monday's aren't the best days, BECAUSE THEY ARE. Half off sushi is what makes this day so enticing. From an extensive wine, appetizer, entree and sushi list: you will find a meal that with leave you remembering your dining experience.  From the soft decor, succulent food, to the intimate seating where your neighbors are close, Parallax has that extra special touch.  The spicy salmon roll and edamame were both deliciously flavored and enough for two people. I highly recommend the 2014 Joseph Drouhin French Chardonay, literally my new favorite in that category. So grab a friend, ask to sit in the dinning or patio area and enjoy the beauty of your surroundings and the amazing tastes you are about to encounter. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service EVERY TIME. Just the right amount of attention and pampering. The food is constantly amazing. The patio is great and wonderful for a sushi lunch.   I always finish every morsel and the desserts are extra special as well.   Highly recommend Parallax anytime!  They know how to pour a drink too!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Parallax.  This is my second visit, and now that I'm yelping I'm compelled to add to the list of reviews.  As with most places in this area, parking can be a bit hit or miss.  I arrived around 6:30 and had no trouble finding a place to park.  Walking though the door at Parallax results in enterign a very cool decor; I love the ambiance here!   We were immediately seated and the server was at the table immediately taking drink orders - a dirty vodka martini, please!    The martini was nicely put together - the right amount of vodka, olive juice, and ice/shaking.  For an appetizer, I had the Fried Green Tomato Stack with pork belly, pimento cheese and sweet corn vinaigrette.  It arrived shortly after ordering and all I can say is YUM!  Everything in the dish was complimentary and flavors were wonderful.     For a main course, I had a series of sashimi pieces.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The only think I can fault them on is creativity.  I'd really like to see more focus on complimenting flavors for the sashimi and a bit more focus on presentation. But fresh and tasty.  Service was good throughout the evening.  Seating for me was 'a bit too close'.  What do I mean by that?  Well, the folks at the table next to us kept asking what we had ordered and how it was.  Yea, I know they were just being social, but when I'm out with 'a special someone', I don't want to socialize with the table next to me.  A bit more space between tables on that middle row would be nice.  Food: B+ Service: B+ Atmosphere: A Price: B"}
{"text":"Love Parallax! The food is delicious, the service is great, and the bartenders are fabulous. Mike makes excellent sushi, and they have a couple fantastic rolls on the happy hour menu.   The service is spectacular...like for real.  I normally sit at the bar and never have to wait to get my drink refilled.  Even when they are busy, they know how to make everyone feel special and welcomed. Totally recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was amazing. My boyfriend and I went for something different. We love happy hour and have been almost everywhere in the Tremont/Ohio City area multiple times. This particular night I got off work early so we were not rushed and could pick a nice spot to enjoy Happy Hour, etc.   I'm giving this place five stars for the service, drinks, & atmosphere. This is a social bar with sociable people. The bartender (I want to say kristen?) is awesome. She has a fun personality and interacts well with guests/recommendations.   The drinks are delicious, I'm obsessed with the Ginger Cosmopolitan. One of the best drinks I can remember. A lot better than a normal Cosmo. The first time I went we got the pot stickers of some sort (beef?) maybe, 2 different sushi rolls, and something else, we also tried the calamari. All of the food was fantastic. I found the sushi was great! I love spicy tuna and they had a great spicy tuna. Another time there I tried the burger -- was not really a fan to be honest. But, the fries were great.   As I said, I've met some very cool and interesting people at this bar which is a sure sign of a great spot!! If you haven't been yet, I suggest you try it!"}
{"text":"The bar tender and hostess were great and super friendly. But our waiter was not nice. We came here for sushi and it was very fresh but it is overpriced."}
{"text":"This was only my second trip into the Treemont/Ohio City area, but I will continue to go back. My date recommended Parallax, since he is more knowledgeable of Zack's places.. we arrived after 9, had some amazing wines, and a few appetizers at the bar. The atmosphere is chic and just perfect for that late, last-minute date night.   He shared the pork potstickers over cabbage (amazing) and I reluctantly shared the smoked salmon potato pancakes, just because they were out of this world delicious. The bartender was friendly and fun and the other guests all seemed to be having a great time. The place was just as crowded when we left near 11, and this was a weeknight.   Definite recommendation."}
{"text":"So, this place deserves 5 stars for the food. One star for the service. I've never experienced such bad service before. Nonetheless, the restaurant should indeed be reviewed on the food, as fellow yelper Lin W. stated, but nonetheless, the service was horrendous.  My party (including yelpers Lin W. and Young P.) went here for Restaurant week last week, to try it out. As I've thought other Zack Bruell restaurants were just okay, I was really quite impressed with the food here. I ordered the three course meal for $30 deal, and got the following:  Duck Confit spring rolls- they were pretty plentiful with the duck meat, and the sauce was quite good. I was also happy that it wasn't too over fried (which tends to happen), and the sauce that came with it was good as well. I was happy with that choice.  Rainbow Trout with ginger rice: The trout was so tender and had a slight crispiness to the top part of it. mmmm. And the flavors were good, with the rice it came with (kind of a slightly sticky rice). I was surprised it wasn't too salty either- which I highly approve it. That trout was really really good.  Thai Coffee Tiramisu: I loveeeeeeeee tiramisu x 200, in general. This tiramisu was definitely much different- you could definitely taste the thai coffee in it, much different from the normal coffee/kahlua taste you normally taste. Nonetheless, it was still fluffy and tasty..and the thai coffee was definitely powerful, which I liked.  In terms of service: The service was okay until the bill came. The waiter brought out the bill for the ten people at my table on one bill. We asked him if there would be any way to split the bill, he stated it would be difficult, but it was fine. If it was too hard, he could have simply stated a \"no\" and we would have put it on one card.   Thus, began our wait. We were the ONLY PEOPLE LEFT in the restaurant, as we had made our reservation at 8:30pm on a Thursday night. The owner had already left, and from that point, it seemed like the wait staff was unwinding for the night. The waiter made us wait a full 30 minutes before even saying ANYTHING, which we had to initiate with him, to ask what the issue was.   He then brought the bill back, stating that he didn't know which credit card went with each bill, although we had given him our cards in separate folders. Really? Jeesh. So we sorted them out, but he had already charged certain ppl's credit cards with the wrong amount.....   We then waited another 30 minutes for him. In the meantime, no one came over to our table to inform us of anything going on, and no one was helping him. What the issue was, we have no idea, as I got up to ask him, but he wouldn't even look at me as I was asking him the problem. He came back with our bills...which were incorrect for some. Jeesh.  So.... it was a full hour of waiting for our bill after the restaurant was closed, due to this waiter. Hopefully, that will never happen again- the food was GREAT, but man, that waiter was totally not good at all..... I hope it was just a fluke this one time. I'm a little hesitant for trying this restaurant again due to our incident, but I really liked the food? Sigh."}
{"text":"a few weeks ago my friend and I made reservations for dinner around 6 I believe we stayed over two hours having a full course meal. I really enjoyed the good service really top notch. I do complain about petty stuff like how small our two person seating table was and how close to the left and right party we were, I heard their entire conversation....food was great! actually I enjoyed the smaller sharing dishes such as appetizers more than the dinner which was some kind of special for the night lamb, I got it  little modified probably should of had it as is but I ate so much didn't want anymore carbs! so replaced with vegetables. the pork belly was surprisingly delicious! very awesome beet cocktail was definitely impressed!! for a sushi place the menu didn't sound like that was what they should be known as a \"sushi restaurant\" it was much better than that but not for the sushi. I would probably go back and sit at the bar get a few drinks and something small to bite on. if I would recommend this place to anyone it would be more for someone on a date or if you're looking for spending money on something different just for trying it even if it happens to be once and never again, was a good experience."}
{"text":"Parallax has upped its game in the last year.  It had slipped in terms of service and food consistency, but now has roared back.    From the moment i stepped in, I felt welcome.   The white tuna roll with its crispy skin was and ideal appetizer with a glass of Pinot Grigio the bartender recommended.    The entree of pan seared trout is a take on a similar dish they do at L'abatros, though here it's Asian inspired.   Perfectly done.   My only suggestion is, the fresher the product, the less you need to do to it.  Maybe back off a bit on the sauce.    I'm glad Parallax is back in the completion in Tremont."}
{"text":"I came here for green hour and was unimpressed with their food. I was really excited to try especially since they have a lot of stars. I thought for happy hour their prices were a little high.   I tried their spicy tuna roll which I thought was just ok. Their calamari fritti was also just alright. I feel like most calamari tastes the same. The potstickers were overfilled and did not taste good. The flavor was just overpowering.   Maybe their dinner menu is better but from what I experienced from their green hour, I'm not sure if I'll ever try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Mon cher chou and I debated whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars.  It wasn't easy.  The food and service were generally amazing, but there were a few dissapointments.   Can I give 5 stars to a place that serves boxed desserts?  If the rating system were ten stars, I would give it nine.  But it isn't so I should just decide. Perhaps if I made a list, it would help.  Good points: fantastic service excellent wine recommendations astonishing smoked salmon on a potato pancake app perfectly executed mahi mahi decadent lobster mac and cheese the best swordfish ever-- not oily at all beautiful modern setting  Nicht sehr gut: trucked in food service desserts overly peppery risotto very crowded/ loud  So let's say 4.5  or even 4.75.  Make your desserts and you get a 5."}
{"text":"A quick update on Parallax.....  First, it has easily lived up to it's 5-star review after several repeat visits. This place remains on my short-list for favorite places to eat in Cleveland.  Secondly, the Walleye. We've had walleye twice now, with 2 completely different seasonal preparations (once a spring-time composition with leeks and rhubarb, and once a summer-Latin composition with a creamed corn and spicy-pepper sauce) a both times it's been absolutely beautiful.   If you want to taste the king of Lake Erie sportfish cooked to perfection, go to Parallax."}
{"text":"Cleveland food may be famous for our own Iron Chef, but the title of best Cleveland Chef goes to Zack Bruell hands down!  Parallax is a staple of Cleveland dining for my wife and I.  We've spent every New Year's Eve there since the restaurant opened 5 years ago as well as any opportunity to celebrate.  Most recently for a romantic Valentine's dinner.  It was the best meal yet.  As always the front is crowded.  Its a small space and the restaurant has big volume for the small space.  Our table is ready and away we go from the mosh-pit.  As usual, my wife and I split everything so we can taste as much as possible.  First up, potato pancake with fresh salmon, creme fresh in burre blanc.  Its the perfect take on Jewish comfort food.  Next, white tuna sashimi with jalapeno-cilantro ponzu.  There is no better sushi in Cleveland than Parallax, and this is the prize offering.  The fish is fresh and delicious, and the ponzu is the perfect spicy compliment.  For dinner, I have the Lamb shank.  Its like something out of the Flinstones' cartoon in size and slides off the bone with a strong stare.  The lamb is prepared with Indian spices that don't overpower the protein yet give the lamb a nice twist on familiar Indian lamb.  It is served over rice and green beans and was equally good as leftover the next day.  My wife has swordfish over black pepper risotto.  The swordfish has great texture, lightly crispy on the outside, but not overcooked in the center.  The risotto is creamy and could overpower the fish if you had too much on your fork.    No Valentines dinner is complete without dessert (though I usually pass).  Before it comes, complimentary dark chocolate truffles.  Ultra rich, slightly bitter, really fantastic.  Dessert tonight: S'mores bread pudding.  Couldn't be beat.  The top was covered in torched marshmallows covering a chocolate infused bread pudding.  My wife said this was the best dessert she's ever had.  The mark of a good dinner: waking up the next morning smacking your lips thinking about how good last night's dinner was.  Thats my barometer for getting 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Our friend who lives in Cleveland recommended this place for sushi. The spicy tuna roll was delicious. I had the undo noodle with pork belly and shrimp, yummy but a bit salty. My husband had caramel chicken ramen, which is pretty good. The service was not as good though. For Asian fusion, this place deserves a try!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Great sushi deal on monday.  Nice intimate restaurant setting.  Goid service.  Nice bar area to relax in too."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town -- and you can get it on Saturday! It may not be one of the cheapest happy hours in town (with things averaging around $8) but I do feel like it's a bargain for the atmosphere and quality.   When it's Saturday and one-half of a couple wants sushi and the other half wants something that's not sushi but just good food, where can you turn? Enter Parallax. The happy hour was a surprise bonus.   The what felt like 30 page clipboard menu was a bit overwhelming and honestly, I wanted to venture off the HH menu for a drink but it was too much and I didn't know how to decide.   The short rib pot stickers were my favorite and I can't wait to come back to have them again!! The sushi rolls were very flavorful and tasty (and seemed fresh) and the tempura green beans were also a stand out!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Tremont. It is one block away from my house and it has taken me over 4 years of living here to work up the nerve to go. The happy hour specials are mostly $5 rolls. We tried some tuna and salmon. Both were great. We also tried the beef pot stickers which were good. The burger is $7 or $8 dollars at happy hour. It comes with a heaping mass of skinny fries. They also have a tuna burger for like a dollar more, which we did not try. Wine is $5 a glass or something. I am usually not a big hefeweizen drinker, but the $2 glass is both tasty and a deal. After glancing at the menu, the prices are more than I would like to spend but not completely out of line. It would be great for a first and or last date. Or if you are me, that usually happens all in one fell swoop. Only because my tastes are extremely particular. Or because I say things in real life that are similar to what I write on Yelp and people don't like that."}
{"text":"We came here and were really excited to try another one of Zack Bruell's restaurants but were pretty bummed about the food at Parallax.  The service was great but the food just was just okay.  The bread seemed stale, and the fish was swimming in butter.  We came for restaurant week which could have been part of it but we don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yeah! Another place that I can add to my list when it comes to sushi! (Ginko is my other go to).   This was my first time here and I sampled 4 different sushi options. I started with a traditional favorite of mine which is spicy tuna roll. Parallax's was good. I liked their chili paste that was drizzled along side the roll on the plate.   Definitely getting a bit more creative, and perhaps straying a bit from traditional sushi, I tried the Panko Breaded Spicy Scallop Roll and the Philly Steak Roll. The latter was amazing with rare steak, cheese, and sauteed peppers and onions. The speciality rolls all come with 4 pieces, though they are quite large and may actually be technically larger than one small traditional roll like the spicy tuna is.   Oysters come in serving sizes of 4, 8 and 12 for the prices listed on the menu. We asked for 8 in whatever variety the waitress chose out of the three options. When the waitress brought the oysters to us she informed us which she had given us and offered us various condiments. We accepted Tabasco sauce and horseradish. There was a special mignonette provided, but I didn't try it as I love a classic oyster presentation and the Tabasco sauce and horseradish mimicked that well.   We sat at the bar and had no trouble getting a seat around 7p on a Monday night, though the place was steadily busy. Service from the bartender was on point. She was attentive, helpful and efficient."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and tried some of the discounted rolls, which were great!.  I think we had spicy tuna and pork belly.  The pork belly was not as good as I thought it would be - it was a bit dry, but we still ate a good amount of it.  While I have been here several times for regular sushi / regular menu, their happy hour menu is VERY extensive and a great bargain !  I didn't try the chili hot dogs, but I wish I did.  I don't know if they will get into a fight with the sushi or who will win, but I am willing to take that risk :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those up and down kid of places.  When it first opened I would have given it just 3 stars, but their food has continued to evolve.  Broad array of options from tapas to sushi, there's going to be something to please everybody in the crowd.  Patio is super pleasant.  The pork belly appetizer is a must have and their ice cream is excellent.  Pretty decent wine selection at reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"We've  lived in the neighborhood for a few years now and it's safe to say we spend a large amount of our entertainment budget here. We love to come in, sit at the bar and joke with the bartenders or our fellow barflies. They change the menu each season with great new items and have fun specials frequently.  I saw in a few of the other reviews references to slow service; let me tell you this is the kind of place where they will get you amazing food done well. They focus on quality not speed. This is cuisine, not Ruby Tuesday, so if you're in a hurry and try to come here you'd best inform your host when you are seated. I've honestly never noticed this being an issue but like I said, we like to socialize with our fellow patrons and make it a full evening.  Heck after writing this review I think I may have to go see them again tonight."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland by miles and perhaps up there overall.  The food here is all outstanding.  I was there for the first time of Wednesday of this week and enjoyed the sashimi and nigiri combination platter that blew me away.  Every piece of fish was extremely tender and fresh and the eel which I am often not all that fond of was outstanding.  On my second visit I had the Thai seafood stew.  I was a little skeptical considering the focus is more sushi and seafood and wasn't sure how the thai flavors would come out but it was also outstanding.  Great flavor, fresh taste that just makes your taste buds very happy.  I also was able to sample the Blue Cod and the Hangar steak and those too were outstanding.  The only thing that was less than great was the desserts which at that time I was probably way too stuffed to enjoy anything else.  I have yet to have a dish that I was any less than impressed with so if you enjoy seafood and sushi I'd say this is a must stop when in Cleveland.  Way underrated."}
{"text":"The bf and I went to celebrate our 7-yr anniversary with dinner @ Parallax.  We had tried to come here on several other occasions, but never made the reservation with enough time in advance to get a decent time.  1. Make your reservation for this place in advance if you want to eat at a \"normal\" dinner hour.  We were seated promptly and the host/hostess was very friendly.  Had a table in the main dining room -- let me tell ya, these tables are close together.  I hope your neighbors at the table next to you are better than ours (more to come below).  Food: We had the shrimp yakitori salad and white tuna sashimi for appetizers.  Both were very delicious.  The sashimi was a little thin-sliced compared to some near-by sushi competitors.  But the flavors were all great.  The shrimp on the salad was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  For entrees, I had the scallops, which were PERFECT! So easy to over-do scallops, but they were perfectly \"melt-in-your-mouth\" on my entree.  The bf had the seafood stew, which came in a super yummy broth.  The only trouble with this dish is that the scallops and the shrimp sitting in the broth will inevitably over-cook while sitting in the hot broth.  Not sure how they can remedy this.  For desert we had the passion fruit cheesecake, which was ok.  Service: Very courteous, but very slow.  We didn't mind too much, as we were happily chatting.  But our neighbors were rather upset, complained to the manager, got free champagne as an apology from the restaurant.  Then they continued to complain about their appetizers (she wanted \"sauce\" on her California roll).  Finally, in all their upset-ness, they started flailing their arms around, knocked over their champagne, spilling it all over me, my legs/shoes, my dress, and my coat.  The manager promptly came over, took my coat to wipe down, brought me napkins, offered to pay for the dry cleaning bill.  He then asked me, \"Can I get you another drink?\"  I was happy with their response and gladly accepted the drink... the only bummer was when I found they actually charged me for the drink at the end of the night.  hmm...  Regardless, food was very good.  We will likely go back.. on some night when we aren't in any rush.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"The five stars is for Chris, who will make you some of the best libations you'll ever drink.  Seriously, he's the best bartender I've encountered in town.   For food, I'd stick with the cooked fish and seafood (the trout's great).  That said, they're doing something funny with the sushi rice, and while my non-Asian counterparts are hungrily inhaling their maki and nigiri, I just can't recommend it."}
{"text":"What a excellent establishment.  Every menu item from begining to end is delicous, along with the strong drinks.  Had a nice assortment of food from a seafood appetizer ( sushi was so good I ordered another round for me and wife before dinner) to a wonderful steak meal.  I would highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I followed our waitress's recommendations and had one of the beat meals I have ever had: salmon tartare, goat cheese and raddachio salad, loup de mer (sea bass) with a delicious sauce that complemented without overpowering. Mousse for dessert was decent. Had two IPA's on draft and they are the two best avaialble in tap anywhere in Cleveland: Columbus IPA and Fathead's."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and all the menus. Ordered hot sake since it was -140548^9 degrees and it hit the spot. I was really craving sushi. and ordered a spicy tuna roll and the pan fried dumplings.  My roll came out first and was presented very well. and was on par with any other sushi i have had might now have been the best but it was still very good i ate all of it. The Dumplings however were nothing less than exceptional. i nice crispy outside and a very flavorful inside. i recommend getting an order to share with whom ever you are with.  Mike the manager came over and introduced himself to me. I enjoyed a pleasant conversation with him while i waited for my food. after i ate he checked back up with me and see how everything was, I said i might get another roll as I was still a little hungry. I told me not to, order anything. He sent me out an order of the Udon noodles.  **(he doesn't know about my obsession with Asian noodles). But let me tell you this was one of the best noodles i have had the please of tasting, no pun intended. the broth was to die for. I would come back just for this dish.  All in all, I had a great meal here. The service was exceptional. With that said, the price point was a little high for my taste. Was everything good? yes it was. but the price was little high for a sushi dinner. But this is my opinion. I will be back, but prob with a date. which make it tough because the food is damn good."}
{"text":"Great drinks--the Bourbon Jam was a hit.  Superior service a la Zack Bruell's restaurants. We are huge fans of L'Albatros, and this was right on par.   The potstickers were fantastic. Definitely order the scallops--you won't regret it. If they have the chocolate mousse cake, you're in for a treat. Also, a previous commenter said the bread was hard and tasteless. I didn't have this experience at all. I typically detest rye bread, but they gave us an especially tasty rye that changed my mind. Everything tasted great.   Great experience, wonderful ambiance, well worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Went to Parallax for Valentine's dinner. There was a nice three course menu that was $75/couple but we decided to order off the full menu. The food was delicious. Fish was cooked perfectly.  My only gripe was that the waiter seemed to be rushing us to make decisions on what to order when we sort of wanted to take it slow and enjoy the meal."}
