{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in any strip mall. Super fresh, all meat is cooked on mesquite broiler. Delicious! Also a condiment bar stocked with goodies."}
{"text":"I love this Mexican food place! This is the place you want to be if you love tacos, burritos, and nachos. If you want to taste Mexican Authentic food then this is the place to be.  They have different type of salsa and the sauce spice goes from mild to hot (whichever you prefer).  I love spicy food and this Mexican restaurant has the best spicy salsa ever!  The carne asada burrito is good too; Chipotle has nothing compare to this place. This restaurant definitely has more meat and the marinated meat is cook to perfection. Don't forget to get some japanenos!!! They are so good!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 60 tacos for our team today for lunch. They were amazing, well priced...and as I write this I'm thinking about a 6th one! Well done and will be a regular order for us I'm sure. Carne Asada and Fuego tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"We're going to keep this simple......OK? 

Do you love Mexican Food? Do you like a small family feel when you go eat? 
Go to this place! Everything is made with love! I walked in, and the owner was there and made my food to order. Had a nice talk with him about Phoenix in general as he basically said he opened his restaurant because Quality Mexican Food can be tough to find in the area.(Most great Mexican places are on the West Side) 
Its about a mile away from my house, and I will be back for sure! 
Fantastic Pastor, great Cabeza, and carne asada made like a backyard cookout!

{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and decided to give it a try. I usually dont go out cause the mexican food is nothing like homemade. This place is the only mexican food I have had that taste homemade from there meat flavors to the salsa its to die for. Hands down the best mexican food in the valley...

{"text":"Bleh. Being from San Diego makes me hard on Mexican restaurants. I say that by way of full disclosure. 
My friend (also from San Diego) came out to visit and help with my newborn. We used the Postmates app to order delivery. We both wanted Mexican and this restaurant was the only one available at the time. We ordered two carne asada nachos and a fish taco. 
Every time I've ever ordered carne asada nachos anywhere else, it's been carne, beans, cheese, guacamole, pico and sour cream. My friend isn't a fan of sour cream and I don't like my nachos with beans, so we made sure to specify that on the order. But, we needn't have worried. Because our nachos arrived with velveeta cheese sauce and carne only. 
I repeat, bleh. The cheese was slimy and fake tasting and the carne tasted heavily of smoke. The chips were house made, but were both stale and incredibly greasy. Also, no salt on them to be found. 
The fish taco was clearly not made with fresh fish. It was hard and rubbery and extremely fishy. The avocado slices were black on one end and displeasingly squishy. It was like all of the old food had been used to make our order. 
Very disappointing, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My buddy from work recommended Fuego Taco Shop for lunch. I am particular about my Mexican food. I am not into trendy hipster taco shops like Chipotle or Chronic Tacos. This was a nice little restaurant with very friendly staff. I had the Fuego tacos. They were very good and the flavor of the red salsa was excellent! If you are looking for great authentic street tacos, I recommend Fuego Taco Shop!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant in the area and didn't even know Al Fuego existed. Once inside, the owner made me feel like an old friend. He took the time to explain each menu item and display his passion for food. I ordered four different items, each better than the last. Sharing with my wife, we had a barbacoa burrito, a Vampiro, a Caramelos and a Fuego taco. The barbacoa was some of the best I have ever had. The owner recommended it plain, without rice or beans. My wife was gracious enough to allow me a tiny bite of the Vampiro before inhaling the remainder. The Caramelos was similar to a quesadilla but somehow much, much better. My favorite was the Al Fuego taco. A chili pepper with cheese and carne asado on a flour tortilla. All of this for less than $15. The best deal in the north valley. 
Don't forget the sauces. The verde was very good, the brown sauce was fantastic. The red was a bit hot but had a really great flavor. The Sinaloan style guacamole was so good I could drink it. 
Both the owner and his son were very friendly and helpful. It was like I visited friends I haven't seen in a while. Amazing food, the alluring smell of food cooking over mesquite and a friendly atmosphere. Al Fuego will be my go to place from now on."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try , it's good we had the street tacos you can definitely expect use to come back , we have passed by here many times and today we seen the sign flipper so he sparked our attention. better then other taco shops we have tried . If you are in the area give them a try ."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on my home and had to stop by. It was the best decision I made because not only are their street tacos the best I've ever had but the service was amazing! I felt super welcomed. I got the #1 which came with 5 carne asada street tacos with beans and rice and it was to die for! Their salsa is also very yummy. Definitely coming back to try the rest of what is on the menu. I recommend this place as they have the best steet tacos ever! Super clean and cheap as well."}
{"text":"So this is a taco bar. A very good taco bar. The Carne Asada is wood fired and really good! Good tortillas recommend the authentic corn."}
{"text":"The best taco al'carbon I have ever had! Full of flavor! Yum! Must taste all of the salsas."}
{"text":"had the nachos carne asada with steak tacos ... to die for!! so good I had trouble breathing from eating too fast lol. would definitely go back over and over to this hole in the wall"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! $1 street tacos that are amazing. Enjoyed so much coworkers and I went back a few times in a couple weeks. Told them they need to be at the AZ taco festival."}
{"text":"Incredibly good salsa. The taste of the food is truley homemade and in my book that scores it a 10 out of 10 or 5 stars.  Oh and by the way the BURRITOS ARE LARGE!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican taco spot this side of the border hands down! Love the salsas and topping that are available to add those finishing touches ... Friendly staff and my favorite is cleanliness!! Good portions for such low prices... Most definite going back."}
{"text":"I had the street tacos - 99Â¢ each.  Great deal for carne asada or pastor tacis,  There was plenty of meat for the price, and the flavor was good, but the carne had several pieces with gristle.  I am rather picky, but I judge a street taco on flavor, tenderness, and price."}
{"text":"The street tacos are great. You get the meat and tortilla and then there is a bar with salsas and toppings so you can make it just how you like it! Definitely worth coming here if you're craving some tacos!"}
{"text":"Our new fave for AUTHENTIC Mex food! Do you like it hot? Stop what you're doing and go to Al Fuego immediately. You won't be disappointed. Atmosphere is humble...food is amazing. Homemade. Super friendly owners. Best Al pastor I've ever had. Salsa and fixins bar let you customize. Don't miss this place. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, the food is good here, especially the Caramelo. I decided to get a side of chips and guacamole this time around. Chips were ok, but had old, crunchy French fries mixed in with them. And the guacamole was obviously a few days old and had waaay too much salt in it!  I'll stay away from those items... If I come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great service. I do wish they had better hours. I have been here a handful of times and they are always consistent. I will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The only thing we get here are the carne asada burritos. They're not amazing but they're ok. Owner is friendly. Need to expand menu, serve Mexican drinks and use different cheese. He's looking for a new cook so maybe it'll go uphill from here."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and chicken burrito. We sampled multiple flavors of tacos. Not too hot for my Midwest palette. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall taco shop. The cook takes pride in her cooking, that much is obvious. My brother and I had the tounge, carne asada and chorizo tacos which were very flavorful. The tounge was heavenly and melted in your mouth. All their cooking is done over a mesquite wood barbecue which lends a delicious smoked flavor to the food.

This place is a must visit if you are in a taco mood, they are also priced very reasonably!"}
{"text":"This place has rude people. Burnt meat and dirty restrooms. Stay away. Come for that Tacos stay get roped in for the garbage."}
{"text":"We like this old school taco shop! Nice staff, quick service! Good prices.

Even tho furniture/tables are old, they ARE clean! 

Love their beverages and nice burritos! We will go back!"}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant is a cool hole in the wall place. The employees were all kind, great customer service and answered our questions. The food came quickly which was great. We were disappointed that there was no salsa bar to dish salsa or hot carrots out for our dishes. They did however bring condiment bottles of the salsas. There were three different salsas. The street tacos are a decent deal. Only $1.25 certain days of the week. The vampiro was nowhere near as cheesy as I've seen, so I was mildly disappointed. The tacos all came with a choice of onion/cilantro or pico on them. If you ordered them fuego they came with cheese and some chilies on them.  Burrito was a decent size and was good. One thing that we weren't fans of was the meat flavor, it all had a smoky taste. Overall, glad we went there to try it. Not bad prices. But I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I had a career asada burrito and a small diet drink. It was good and fresh and tasty. Good choice of salsa and sauces. Worth coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Reviews are totally right about this place. I'm going to keep it simple here cause that's the kind of place Fuego Taco Shop is. Came a little after 6 on a Monday evening, a few people in there, not slammed but not dead either. As the people ahead of me in line were finishing up I was trying to decide between all the amazing sounding things on their menu. Decided to stick with a classic, carne asada burrito and was not disappointed. Way better than your standard \"bertos\" carne asada and miles ahead of something like Taco Bell. There is a salsa bar off to the side with a few really good house made salsas. Price was definitely reasonable and the food came out fast. Not much to mention in regards to service, it was just a counter joint, they took my order and got me my food promptly, don't think anything else is needed at a place like this.

Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So I was drawn into getting lunch at this place by a $0.99 taco sign waved by a guy on the corner. This place was a little gem. There was an order counter with a menu above and tejano music playing. I wanted the $0.99 street tacos so that's what I got: the combo for $6 which included 5 street tacos and a drink. There were only 2 meat choices that day so I got 3 carne asada and 2 carne al pastor. I was prewarned that the tacos come naked (meaning meat and wrap only) and I would need to doctor them up. She also told me the al pastor was a little on the sweeter side. The salsa bar had pico de gallo, onions with cilantro, 2 salsas and lime. 
The tacos were a little smaller than I expected to be honest. Smaller than the corn tortilla you can get at the grocery store. That's the only reason this place is getting a 4 instead of a 5. I really liked the al pastor marinade. It made the taco for me. The carne asada had a good flavor but a little dry. 
They had plenty of other things on the menu that I am looking forward to try. The vampiros tacos have me curious or the chile relleno or even sides like rice and guacamole. Good place that's close to me!"}
{"text":"Great tacos!!!

Definitely a hole in the wall taco shop. Loved the tacos and shared the fries. Would definitely recommend getting them all. The sauces on the side are also great! They have one that is labeled just in case you cannot handle spice, but it's pretty great."}
{"text":"Fuego tacos are amazing!!  Hole in the wall place that's delish.  Great guac and salsa too!  Check this place out."}
{"text":"Having gone to Mexico since I was a baby, I fell in love with their tacos and the upbeat lifestyle there. My family has been trying to find real Mexican tacos in Phoenix for a long time. We've finally found the place. Fuego Taco Shop is excellent and run by an awesome family!"}
{"text":"Good like taco place. Has 99 cent street tacos. Great place to drop off your in a hurry and want tacos."}
{"text":"They have dollar tacos that are extremely affordable. I recommend the carne asada. I wasn't a fan of the pastor as much which is usually my taco of preference. They also have fuego tacos that a bit larger and come with cheese and green chile. All the tacos have a delicious smokey taste."}
{"text":"No thrills, delicious mesquite grilled carne asada and delicious al pastor.  The mesquite grill flavor is what really sets this place apart from standard taco shops.  Also, this place as the hottest salsa I have found in taco shop in years.  I usually sneak an extra one or two to go but next time I might just ask them to buy 6-8 oz of the salsa to keep at home (it's that good).

My only small gripe would be to add a few more items in the toppings bar like maybe some cabbage, jalapeÃ±os, etc but I'm guessing that comes on the slightly more expensive tacos.  

99 cent street tacos are small but delicious, what do you expect it's a buck!"}
{"text":"This place opened where my previous favorite Mexican restaurant was. Wow...no disappointment here. You walk in and there are mesquite logs right in the hall way. No frills, hole in the wall but excellent carne asada. We tried the vampiro and fuego tacos...so good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Carne Asada and Carmelos. Homemade salsa with some gusto and lots of flavor. This is my got to Carne Asada place when the mood hits me and it hits often."}
{"text":"The only good thing about the food, was the taste of the meat.  You can tell the logistics are off, they don't have a great system or and also the presentation and proportions of the food.

I recently had jaw surgery so was looking forward to one of my first meals, and wanted to check this place out.  The girl up front took my order wrong, I said I wanted 1 Medium Carne asada Burrito (really small), 2 cabeza tacos and 1 pastor.  When I opened the food up there was 1 Burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  So no cabeza and no pastor which I really wanted to try both of them; so was really disappointed because it wanted it to be a special meal.  I can really honestly say that I can make better tacos at home with better presentation and of course the meats I like.  Hopefully they can work the kinks and make themselves better!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were riding our motorcycles through town and found this little place. The Food Tastes GREAT, Awesome little \"Street Taco's\", Just a little hole in the wall nothing fancy. Great service and food Is all we want ...Al Fuego, Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Not the best taco shop I've been to, but definitely good. The carne asada was the best, a lot better than the al pastor. The fuego tacos are different with cheese and chili pepper in them. I'd reccomend trying it. Pretty clean and great service though."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Reminded me of my hometown in Sonora. I had the carne asada burrito and the carne asada fuego taco. Both were very tasty and i recommend this place. This is the second taco shop in town that I have personally found to be the most authentic to Sonora. It's been tough for me to find a legit burrito/taco place. So, when I find a gem, i think its important to let you know."}
{"text":"3rd taco place I've tried on this brief trip to Phoenix and the best. The carne asada is special (cooked over mesquite) and the service was really friendly and clearly valued the business. I worked in a corner for a few hours and there was a steady stream of regulars and newcomers coming in. Good vibe, food, and value."}
{"text":"Fuimos a este lugar por los buenos comentarios, pero nos llevamos una desilusiÃ³n, yo probÃ© los vampiros, la carne no sabÃ­a fresca sino recalentada. Mi esposo pidiÃ³ los tacos de pescado sabÃ­an a aceite requemado. Las personas as eran amables pero la comida no. No vuelvo y no lo recomiendo."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!! Holy cow the carne is unbelievable. They use mesquite wood and you can taste the awesomeness. Stopped here just by chance and I'll be back. I live in fountain hills but it's worth the drive. This food should cost more!"}
{"text":"$1 street tacos on mondays and Wednesdays,  $1.25 any other time. Service is quick and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. This is a place i certainly visit weekly."}
{"text":"Wow - another local place with killer tacos.

Based on what my buddy and I tried for lunch, order anything with Carne Asada and you'll be a happy camper!  Can't wait to go back and try some other items!"}
{"text":"Their signature taco, The Fuego, is a hall of fame candidate. Pleasant staff and good service always.
Def worth trying."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with some good street style tacos. There hot sauce is excellent with the right amount of heat. The street tacos are small but the tortillas were cooked perfectly. I wish they would have doubled up the tortillas because they had a tendency to fall apart with only one. Second negative is refills on drinks is 50 cents. Meh I just throw that in the undesirable category. And last reason and only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I had a few in edible gristle pieces of meat in my carnitas. Overall 7/10."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! We tried carne Asada, al pastor, and the been and cheese burrito. All were excellent. We loved the chips and salsa. Great service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Got the steak tacos. I don't know if they had it on the menu at the time but i asked for a bean and cheese burrito as my gf is vegetarian. Without any delay he threw a tortilla on the stove top and said he can make one. Service is exceptional food is good too. I'd prob go there a lot more if they offered chicken as I don't eat red meat too often."}
{"text":"Love the authenticity of the food.  

I tried a large Asada burrito.  Loved the tortilla, beans and the Asada.  Had to top if off with the green spicy salsa.  Washed it down with a great tasting Horchata."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food place. 
Food has an amazing mesquite flavor and the Fuego taco has a nice kick too!
Drive up from Tempe just to eat here"}
{"text":"This place is the SPOT for tacos.  You smell the mesquite fired up when you walk in for that meat and their pastor is some of the best I've ever had.  Being born and raised in LA I'm from the land of street tacos and these are on point!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Family owed and operated, hands down the best taco's around. I like that they make everything to order. I have been there several times and plan on returning several more. I highly recommend this place for your next taco...
Thanks,
Theresa C"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada! 
The tortillas aren't made there but are fresh tasting! 
Lots of salsa choices. 
Very friendly staff. 
Clean
Extremely affordable!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass street tacos. I lived in Mexico for over 15 years and this place makes better street tacos than I can find in Mexico. Esthetically, this place is a dive... but the food is clean, fresh, simple and super tasty. They wood-fire grill (using mesquite) most of their meats. If you are looking for real authentic tacos, this is the place."}
{"text":"Not Good Disappointing

This was my first visit to Fuego Taco Shop.  In my opinion  the food just isn't very good. On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered the asada and al pastor tacos,  we were both very disappointed with our entrees.

My lunch companion told me that her pastor tacos were flavorless.  To be perfectly honest, the tacos looked flavorless. The carne asada taco consisted of chunks of flavorless beef in a warm tortilla and the tortilla didn't look very appealing. 

The tacos just did not have a lot of flavor, were slightly overcooked, and just had a strange unappetizing taste.  The food  just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Sent my husband on a quest today to get me authentic mexican food and after having found this place on Yelp, was excited to find someplace nearby.  Simple request, 2 carne asada tacos with guacamole and pico de gallo, rice & beans without cheese and chips with green and red salsa.
Now I know I can't expect my husband to remember everything but I received only 2 carne asada tacos with rice & beans, without cheese and a couple of red salsas.  No guacamole, no pico de gallo and no chips.  Honestly, the carne asada tacos were delicious and with a little salsa and some lime juice I did enjoy my meal, but the rice and the beans were a bit blah and without flavor.  Would have loved the guacamole too.  We'll return and I'll make sure my husband checks the bag next time for my guacamole, pico de gallo and chips."}
{"text":"$8.50for a bean and cheese burrito and three street tacos, not drink. First the soupy bean and no cheese burrito was ok, no flavor. Next the street tacos was plain as in no lettuce, no cheese. The carne Asada was over cooked with liquid smoke as the flavor. I'm giving two stars because the salsa was ok. Sorry but I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious for a what looks like a cheap, fast taco shop! I'm pretty sure they smoke all their meat over hickory because the flavor in the meat was very thorough and impressive. We got to the shop before it opened and waited for it to open because my Friend recommended  it- it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Bought the $.99 pastor street tacos.  Tacos were authentic tasting and delicious!  Kids got the carne asada street tacos where the meat is cooked on mesquite wood giving it a great flavor.  Definitely worth your time and money!  Fairly cheap prices too."}
{"text":"I anticipated a fantastic taco from the reviews, however I found them to be mediocre.  Had both the carne asada and pollo asada tacos and thought the meat was kinda tough. They were out of guacamole as well.  The rice was good and fluffy, however not any better or different than other taco shops I have tried."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place.  I just recently moved into the area & frequent the restaurant often.  All the salsas are made freah, daily & are available in a salsa bar. The heat range varies from mild to pretty hot & the menu is simple but ample & tasty. 

They recently started serving breakfast too. The bkft burritos are fresh & great portions.  Forget about fastfood chains; this place is local & authentic! 

Open daily except Sundays.  Highly recommend! 

Viva Al Fuego!"}
{"text":"Easy to drive past and not very noticeable from the road - DON'T miss it!! Real Mexican style tacos - simple, fresh, good ingredients. How hard is that? Shouldn't be but so so many places get it wrong.

Walked in at 5:55 - 5 minutes before it was meant to close - and the owners could not have been nicer or more welcoming. Husband and wife team and clearly they were made for owning a restaurant. Super friendly - happy to customize the menu - nice people.

The tortilla chips come out hot and ridiculously freshly made. The home made salsas hit the spot. Went with my wife, kids and parents (who aren't big on Mexican food) and everyone loved it. Continues ordering until 6:30 and they could not have been nicer about it. As we left - at 6:45 - other people coming in... so they may have ended up with a late night."}
{"text":"Do NOT let the outside of this place turn you away!! It is a total hole in the wall, but we found this place because of Yelp!!
Born and raised in AZ, we were visiting family and were craving some good Mexican food and tacos.. We decided to give this place a try, and we are so happy that we did. We went with the daily taco special, and it was fantastic!! Totally hit the spot! The quality of the meat was perfect. We will definitely be back when we come back to the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"This pleace. Oh man, so good they use mesquite when cooking the steak. Cant be beaten. These are the best tacos this side of the border."}
{"text":"This is the best \"hole in the wall\" taco shop in the valley! When you walk in, you're greeted with a smokey wood fire smell and that sets the stage. The meat on the tacos is juicy and well seasoned and paired perfectly with a grilled tortilla. This place is a must! Will be a frequented for me hands down."}
{"text":"Had the Al Fuego and cabeza tacos - both were awesome.  The carne asada had a distinct smokey flavor that went perfectly with the green chili.  I gave it a dash of salsa to add some heat and it was great.  One of the reviewers complained the meat is gristly - he's probably right, place is a bit of a dive and I probably don't wanna know too much about the ingredients.  Doesn't matter though cause the tacos got FLAVOR."}
{"text":"Great food, only personal issue is don't like my guac spicey. Pork was particularly awesome."}
{"text":"Al FUEGO has great authentic flavor and portions are generous. A large selection of salsa to create a different flavor to your liking . Those tiny little places are always the hidden gems. I actually told the owner he should raise his prices because you get so much for the price. Check it out this is one not to miss."}
{"text":"OMG, I just can't believe the great reviews. My wife and I stopped here because of the reviews. Unfortunately,  it was awful. The tacos al pastor were mostly liquid with very little pork. The rice was flavorless.  The beans were nothing more than unflavored unseasoned mush.  The huevos were so runny as to question if we were going to be sick. So we asked for scrambled eggs as a substitute.  They then charged $5 for 2 scrambled eggs with some sort of seasoning that tasted like sawdust. Sorry but this was awful."}
{"text":"Mediocre At best , being such a high rating I was so excited to try it out and it was nothing special the chicken tasted raw . Wrong order not once but twice in the same sitting....."}
{"text":"The meats are the star here with delicious, tender, seasoned and smoky mesquite-fired flavor. Very friendly service from the cute girl at the counter, too. Great place."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Got pastor street tacos with onion and cilantro; wish I had bought two more!! This place is yummy and I will definitely be back. Hard to read the sign out front, but worth the effort to find it -- across from the bowling alley. I've been back twice since and their carne asada is BOOOOMB! Love the wood in the hallway. I believe it's a family business. Pollo tacos are also really awesome- that wood smoked flavor is just SOooooooo good. The mild salsa is flavorful and the hot is a nice thrill -- beware of the delayed heat!"}
{"text":"So far so good.  Carne asada tastes wonderful.  Has a nice mesquite flavor.  Glad this is nearby, and so much better than all the `bertos out there."}
{"text":"I was looking to eat fish tacos , I found this Resturant on yelp , the food was delicious , very warm people and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So this is very tough for me as I have been coming here for nearly a year. My past two visits were extremely disappointing. Maybe they have a new cook or new management but it's borderline inedible. Two weeks ago I ordered the breakfast burrito with carne asada. I ended up with grizzled chewy meat which made my meal inedible. Today I ordered the always fantastic Fuego tacos which I have always liked. I asked for three tacos, one cabeza(cheek) and two carne. I ended up with 3 cabeza (already an issue getting the order incorrect) and it was mostly fat and grizzle again. I have never written a poor review for a restaurant but I just had to because it was just so bad. I've included a picture of what I dealt with today.  I wont be returning, nor will my co-workers.  I hope they figure it out as it is a local family business.

Note* It was brought to my attention that I should fix my review because cabeza meat is supposed to be greasy. Yes, i do know it is supposed to be greasy and not the most lean meat of the cow.  I only had chunks of fat with a few sparing pieces of meat in my tacos.  My coworker is of mexican heritage and said that it was very poor and she was unable to see any significant meat in the tacos as well."}
{"text":"Super good. We were in the parking lot at Jerry's golf balls and figured we'd stop by. Fuego tacos were really good and so were the rice and beans. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Come here and get tacos. Customer service is A++ and the food speaks for itself !!!"}
{"text":"This place closes earlier than most competitors, so it took us a while to finally make it out to Fuego before closing time. It's a pretty bare-bones taco shop with some tables, chairs, and a salsa bar.  

We ordered some street tacos with carne asada and barbacoa, as well as one of their fuego tacos, which is a bigger-sized carne asada taco that incorporates cheese and a deadly jalapeno into the mix. While I saw other meat options on the menu, they seemed to not have much else available since they were within 30-45 minutes of closing.

I really liked the mesquite-flavored carne asada. If I were writing a review strictly based on the carne asada alone, it would be much higher. The smokey flavor can be subjective, but I've always been a big fan. The barbacoa was just average. As for the fuego, it definitely lives up to its name! The inclusion of the pepper made it way too hot for my tastes, as it was the only one that I didn't finish. The rice, on the other hand, was pretty bland.

Overall, I didn't think the tacos were too bad. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but not quite the worst either. We might return at some point in order to try some of their other options during an earlier hour of the day.  

Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Delicious! Carne asada was a bit greasy but it was yummy. Tostada chips were fresh and not greasy or saturated with salt - perfect in my opinion! Traveling through but will stop again in the future when in the area."}
{"text":"Great tacos from a hidden gem! The mesquite fired carne asada was awesome - so full of flavor. The fresh made selections on the salsa bar pair great with the tacos. Counter service and a small dining area create an intimate environment. Place is not fancy but is clean and the staff are very friendly. I like to give my business to establishments that truly appreciate my business, not to mention serving delicious food. I will be back and I will bring others."}
{"text":"Best tacos north of the border. I've spent years in Mexico, and these are the only tacos I've had at a retail establishment in America that rival tacos I. Mexico. The flavor of the beef is so close to Sonoran beef I couldn't believe it!! Great guac and great prices too. Simple place with the focus on food."}
{"text":"Just found this hole in the wall and I'm glad I did. Food is awesome with great flavor. Staff is friendly. Will definitely be back again. Thanks and keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican food. I really love the carne asada, it has a mesquite smoked flavor and is just fantastic. They also make a great habanero salsa, very spicy. The fuego taco is one of my favorites. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Oh my! I am in love!!  The hole in this strip mall where amazing Mexican food used to be has made me sad for over a year.  I'm so glad that we locals can have amazing, authentic Mexican food again!  

We had carne asada burritos and tried one of each of the tacos - Fuego, Al Carbon and regular.  Deliciousness!!  The fresh guac and salsa was the icing on the cake!!  Sooo good!  

Welcome to the neighborhood, Al Fuego!!  We're so glad you're here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! True to its roots and a little taste of Mexico! Their fuego taco with cheese and Anaheim pepper was delicious. Cheap and so worth every bite!"}

{"text":"Came here for lunch because I heard the carne asada was the best around. I must say it's probably the best I've had in AZ!! I definitely will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Excellent little Taco Shop out of the way on Bell Rd. You can't beat the food, fresh salsa bar, great customer service because the staff are extra friendly and accommodating man and they have some of the best tasting carne asada I have ever had so come try this place you won't be disappointed oh ya and they have .99 cent tacos"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat for lunch and came upon this little gem!  We were not expecting such great tasting tacos!  My son ordered a bean and cheese burrito and that was also good!  The tortillas were homemade And fresh.  And prices are great!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Excellent salsas. The Al pastor was perfect. I'd like to maybe see a dessert item or two added to the menu. That is the only thing I could ask for from this place."}
{"text":"Service: friendly. Fast food. Not a long wait. 

Environment: fast food place. Clean. Lots of art work on the walls. Clean. 

Parking: lot. Spacious. 

Food: I hot the nachos with carne asada, sour cream, guac and beans. Theres a salsa bar, I added Pico and mild salsa. The carne asada is well marinated and as a smokey flavor. It is so delicious. Wasn't greasy. Portion is large. Highly recommended!! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really good! Some of the best carne asada I've had around here. The Al Pastor was super good too! Will go back for sure! FYI - the red salsa is hot!"}
{"text":"Loved our experience here.  They custom made a dish for my wife who is vegan.  In doing so, they knocked it out of the park.  

Prior to serving the experimental dish (potato vegan tacos) they brought out a sampler to see if it was to her liking.  That's NEVER happened to us before.  

The freshly made chips are delightful.  I would drive out of my way to patronize this restaurant again !"}
{"text":"Great little taco shop. Friendly people. Excellent tacos. We all got Fuego tacos and the street tacos were also good. 99c street tacos on Monday and Wednesday"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic tacos. I'd suggest the fuego tacos if you like spice. It is never busy and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down best Asada tacos I have ever had.  Chicken and El Pastor were good too but the Asada is where it's at.  Would drive clear across town to get these tacos if I had to."}
{"text":"It is true street tacos no want to be here. Salsas fresh and with great heat range . Tried this place because of man with sign making it clear this is ace for tacos.
Great food great employees."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and wanted to be thrilled but it was at best average. The good parts were the family, their son was learning how to run the front of house and for being a kid, he did a great job. The prices were super reasonable. The wait time for food prep was just fine. The quality was good and flavor was delicious. Everything was fresh and even though the menu was small, the variety was good.
Now for the average part. The authentic prep is somewhat lacking in that the tacos come with absolutely nothing but meat and tortilla. The salsa bar was not stocked well and the salsas were all extremely spicy hot. I like spice and this was way spicier than I cared for. We ordered some chips as a side and had nothing to dip them in. Asked if they had something more mild and they didn't. Overall, we were a bit disappointed from the other YELP reviews because we really expected this to be a hidden Mexican gem and it really wasn't."}
{"text":"It's a pretty decent place, not luxurious Mexican food. But it's tasty, and pretty cheap. 
Taco de asada and fuego taco,  asada burro are very good. 
I was not a fan of the al'pastor taco. 
The horchata is o k."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST authentic Mexican food around. The spice is phenomenal! Great service too!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place has the most amazing effing carne Asada that has ever touched my lips. It is as if when I eat it a party begins inside of my mouth and everyone starts dancing and singing and it's a happy mouth. It's so happy that in that moment I feel like if I died it would be OK. I wouldn't mind because the euphoria that spread throughout my body after eating a meal there would satisfy my life. But now I have a problem. I am addicted and I get cravings almost twice a day for their food. The only problem is they are only open until 6 PM. So every day at dinner time I look up at the clock and curse the heavens because usually it's 15 after:( oh Fuego taco shop why can't you be open past six?"}
{"text":"TL;DR: amazing salsa, amazing smells, amazing tacos. inexpensive. vegan/vegetarian friendly, just let them know what you don't eat and they'll work with you. friendly ambiance - sometimes special requests are a drag, but the chefs and staff seemed happy to help. can't wait to go back!
-
the first thing you'll notice is the smell of mesquite in this tiny restaurant. the chefs talk about their food with pride and a smile - and they should, because this place is awesome. 

the tortilla chips were the freshest i'd ever tasted, chewy yet crispy, lightly salted. perfect in every way. the guac we ordered as a side was good, especially as a contrast to the two unbelievable salsas: hot and really hot. the heat balances perfectly with smoky, acidic flavours, and is never so overpowering that you can't taste the tacos or chips underneath. it's magical. one verde/tomatillo and one traditional red salsa with red pepper flakes and dark pools of what I think were flavoured oil... no idea, but delicious. 

we ate assorted vegan tacos - the refried beans here aren't made with manteca/lard, so that, rice, onions & cilantro and a slice of avocado on top made a perfect three-bite entree on a white corn tortilla. a line of salsa and it's just hot enough to keep you scarfing them down and drinking soda fountain refills. 

6 tacos, chips and guac, and drinks, all under $20 including tip. do yourself a favor, especially if you're all chipotle'd out and craving real mexican food."}
{"text":"Always the best service and best tacos in town !!! PLUS YOU CANNOT BEATH THE PRICE ANYWHERE... I've eaten at almost taco place in az and no taco compares"}
{"text":"I've eaten at so many Mexican Reatraunts in My life and I have one back home that is the bench mark for taste and spice, Now I've moved here in Phoenix searching for anywhere that taste like home and must of eaten 5-8 places and nothing comes close to Al Fuego!  I don't give 5 stars on Yelp easily...this place deserves every star ...eat here ..they have .99 tacos ...whole family can eat cheap!"}
{"text":"Had the carne Asada and the Cabeza tacos. Both were really good! Very flavorful. Will definitely come back again and try other stuff."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since i tried it for the first time last week. You can't beat $1 tacos.  The $1 ones only come in carne asada and al pastor. The pastor is different than any pastor ive ever had but still good.  I prefer the carne asada. I am yet to try anything else but they also have breakfast and regular burritos and some other things"}
{"text":"If you want bland food. Eat here! We decided to try the place due to the great reviews. But the food and service was terrible.  First off we ordered tacos. My tacos came out with one corn tortilla and meat on it. Nothing else. No cilantro or onions. Nothing. So when we asked if there was salsa they said it was in the salsa bar. Nothing in the salsa bar except cucumbers carrots and jalapeno sauce (green spicy sauce). The meat tasted super bland like all they used to season it was pepper. We also got a burrito. Same thing beans cheese and Carne esada. Very bland.  No seasoning. They finally brought us some Pico DE Gallo for the tacos but at that point we were done.  And it wasn't even good. We ordered chips and salsa. We got no salsa and the chips were rubber. So terrible. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"First visit, but I had to try this place based on the reviews!  Carne asada is always my favorite,and Fuego Tacos did not disappoint. When I walked in I could smell the mesquite smoke from the grill.  Yum!  I was greeted promptly by a friendly cashier who happily answered a couple.of questions for me about the menu.   Today, street tacos were $1.25, so I ordered three for a quick snack.  They are corn tortillas about three inches across and only have meat on them, but are  absolutely delicious!  I used fresh pico de gallo and a yummy green salsa to dress them.  I like my carne asada a little browned and chewy, Fuego's is indeed perfect.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"There are times I have an urge to give a place a terrible rating just so I can keep it my little secret. Of course I would never actually do that, my greater desire is to see them succeed and prosper so I have them to go to for a long time to come.

Fuego Taco Shop one cold wintery Friday afternoon immediately became a new neighborhood favorite for me. It is tiny and located in a run-down strip mall amidst a lot of automotive repair places and fast food joints and they are easy to overlook as you drive by.

But inside they are clean and warmly friendly and their unique but limited menu is a far cry from all the other me-to Mexican restaurants nearby. I fully get it that some people who are used to Taco Bell won't understand that certain types of meat that are authentic to other cultures may be too foreign for them and the use of a mesquite barbecue grill at a taco shop may taste \"weird\" if fast food is all you've ever known, but if you've traveled extensively your opinion may be totally opposite.

At first glance the prices seem a bit high but once you see the quantity and quality of the food there is no quibble with how much they charge. 

We both had the Fuego tacos combo at about $10 each. Their fountain drinks are reasonably priced at 75 cents and $1.25 with the smaller one being considered a large at most fast food places, and here they don't taste as watered down.

The al pastor soft tacos are generously filled with tender tasty kabob-like meat with a hearty mesquite charcoal flavor. We choose to have it topped with pico de gallo which nicely complimented the meat. The three tacos were accompanied by a lightly spiced Spanish rice and tangy refritos and we opted for a hotter than average salsa to add some additional fuego.

I love this place and would not change a thing. Well, okay I would make one tiny almost insignificant suggestion ... please switch to slightly larger plastic forks, if you shop at Costco you might find them at the same price as those you're buying now, but the current ones are just too tiny to eat rice and beans with. Thanks."}
{"text":"Their mesquite grilled carne asada tacos are the best! I wish this place opened until later because it isn't always possible to make it in before closing time."}
{"text":"Nice place, nothing to write home about. Price for quesadilla was high for the portion. Sort of a glorified Filibertos"}
{"text":"Brrrooooooo just go here no joke it's the best you will find. I have drove past to many times I'm almost mad at myself. Do yourself the favor and go get the flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty sad. Showed up 20 min before closing and planned on getting the food to go. Good thing because they gave us 0 say in the matter. Nachos had movie theatre style cheese on them and a spoon full of retried beans. Terrible. All the carne was burnt (3 vampiros, 4 Street tacos), the burrito was cold and stuffed with sour cream and refried beans. When we could find a piece of carne it was burnt. Pretty bad experience and kind of upset I blew $22 here especially after seeing the 4.5 star total."}
{"text":"Small little place but bomb dot com tacos for sure. I had two steak street tacos and a chicken taco and my boy friend had the Vampiros taco and two el pastor street tacos and we were not disappointed the slightest. Green sauce isn't too hot either which is really nice."}
{"text":"Great street taco. They give you enough Salsa for about half your order and then want to charge you for more salsa plus the salsa is watered down. It seems they are running off customers chasing penny's.  Good food but ownership is too cheap."}
{"text":"I hate to kill all the 5 star reviews, but I have to!  This place was meh and I will tell you why............

Came here a few weeks back because I was craving some carne asada.  According to these Yelp reviews, this asada was legit.  I drove on down because I had to find out.

I walked inside and the place was empty.  A dude was sitting behind the register and I saw a ladies head in the back kitchen area.  I scoped out the menu for a bit and decided to go with a Fuego Taco and a Carne Asada burrito with no beans.  My total was right around $10.00.  I paid the man my money and then I took a seat.  Here is where it kind of went South...........

I was sitting there waiting for my food and I saw the lady cook in the back straight up wipe her nose with her forearm.  I probably should have bounced right then and there and gotten my money back and gone somewhere else.  I decided that it wasn't a total deal breaker (I've been to taco carts all over the place where sanitary conditions are questionable.  I have never gotten sick before and my stomach is pretty solid.) and decided to eat what I had ordered.  I stocked up on some salsas and took my food to go.  I drove back to work and dug in.  Here is how everything was...................

Fuego Taco-  This thing looked solid.  It was a small open faced taco with carne asada, green chilis, and melted mozzarella cheese (interesting choice of cheese).  I folded it up and took a bite.  I was pretty impressed.  The carne asada had a great smoky flavor and the chilis added some bite.  The cheese was melted nicely and the tortilla was nice and soft.  The main component in this was that the carne asada had no gristle in it.  I wish I could say the same about my next item..............

Carne Asada Burrito-  I got this burrito without the beans that usually come with it.  This thing had carne asada and cheese and that's it.  The size of the thing was decent but right when I bit in, I knew it wasn't going to be good.  First bite in, I got an unchewable piece of gristle.  Nasty!  I also noticed that the cheese they use is mozzarella.  If it was melted it would have been decent.  This was straight up cold shredded mozzarella.  The layering of the burrito was all wrong too.  All the meat was on one side, the cheese on the other.  I took a few more bites and got more gristle.  Not sure how you can have a very good taco, but a horrible burrito all from the same place.  After awhile, I was picking through the burrito to find \"good\" pieces of meat.  I picked out all the cheese and tried to make the best of it.  I wound up wasting about 2/3rds of the burrito.  Super bummer.  Way too much gristle in this burrito and even the \"good bites\" weren't that great.

Sadly, I will never come back.  It had potential and the taco was actually really good.  The burrito was horrible though and the wipe of the nose pretty much made me not want to come back anytime soon.  My quest for good carne asada in Phoenix continues......."}
{"text":"My wife and myself have been here a couple times and have not had a bad experience with anything we have ordered.

Overall great food & good atmosphere make for some good Mexican food.

This is an edit after realizing I reviewed the wrong place and wanted to make sure this review was accurate to the location."}
{"text":"I have been searching far and wide for a good menudo. Turns out it was right under my nose! It bucks the trend of red menudo by serving the white. It has the perfect balance of hominy and tripe. Great flavor and not a lot of bones. 
Their signature tacos are some of the best I've had. Great flavor in the meat!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Don't let the menu fool you when you walk in; there's much more options. Chicken burritos, pastel burritos, Barbadoa tacos. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Simple. Very good. Will return. Had 3 vampiros tacos, with carne asada and melted cheese, on a hard tostada. Carne was juicy, yet smoky, which worked well with the toasty tostada and cheese. Salsas are spicy and still have my lips tingling as I write the review. Solid hole in the wall for a few quick tacos that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!!!  One big problem, they aren't always open when they say they will be.  Open at 9 is more like open when I get up in the morning.  I would definitely be there more often if I wasn't stuck going to Carls Jr in the morning when I find out nobody is there.  Again, Amazing Tacos, Burritos, and more!  The food is outstanding.  But they have to be open to get some."}
{"text":"Great food and inexpensive.   Atmosphere is non-fancy.  The carne asada is great, as well as the chicken.   grilled on mesquite, they have a nice smoky flavor.  I like that all the food is made fresh."}
{"text":"A-MA-ZING!!! Best little taco place I've been to in AZ!!! The Fuego Taco was so super delicious! Don't pass up the guacamole- incredible! Sergio (owner) is so nice and takes pride in his place. We'll be back next week for sure...glad I don't live close by (I'd be huge from Fuego Tacos!!). Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Driving around North Phoenix on Taco Tuesday and had to celebrate when I drove past Fuego Tacos. I stopped in and ordered 4 carne asada tacos and Fuego Taco... The Carne asada ones were basic corn with carne asada, they had a salsa bar with several different options with toppings. The fuego taco came in a flour tortilla with green Chile that was BOMB... I was planning on even getting another fuego taco before I tapped and decided I couldn't have any more tacos. The location is very small and only has like 5 small tables inside but it has become one of my favorites on this part of town for a quick taco for lunch. If your looking for real Mexican street taco you may be content with this place however, the fuego is nowhere near authentic, but if your open to trying new things it is worth getting a couple of those over the basic street tacos."}
