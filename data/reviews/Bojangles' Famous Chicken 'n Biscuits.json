{"text":"SLOOOOOWEST Bojangles ever!!! Been stuck in the drive-thru for over 20 mins now and there's no way to back out. Save yourself the struggle and go across the street to Zaxby's if you want fast food chicken."}
{"text":"Check your order if you go thru the drive thru!  Been there twice, paid extra for white meat only . . . got a bunch of legs and thighs.  I don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru in Charlotte. I've been here numerous times with the same results. The food is typically good if you have 15-20 minutes to get through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Over the years the quality of food at this location has sadly deteriorated however the prices keep going up.   Standing in line the cook came out with a tray of boiling water and poured over the gravy which was already watered down and began to mix the water in with the gravy. The Bo-taters was good I admit. However a single chicken thigh costing $3.69 +tax etc..  tasty yet very greasy.  In the dining area the persistent flies attacking constantly from every direction. Will NOT go back. Sad I love Bogangles hope it is just this location."}
{"text":"The food always takes extremely long. The customer service is sub par. The lobby is always dirty. The parking lot is hard to navigate."}
{"text":"Honestly don't know what everyone is raving about. Fries were good but were sweet? Biscuit and chicken were tasteless."}
{"text":"I love bojangles and for ease this place is the closest to my house. I have never ever had a good experience at this one. They have messed up my drive thru order every single time. They leave items out or give me the wrong item every time. I do not know how this is possible every time. The workers are the most incompetent fast food workers I have dealt with. Exit 25's looks like geniuses compared to these people. They don't care and it shows. Every single time!!!"}
{"text":"This is the only Bojangles I know that the 4 pc chicken supreme combo will be done right. Chicken always tastes fresh, so does the biscuits. The employees are pretty chill, the customers be trippin' sometimes . Never had a problem about this place."}
{"text":"A majority of the time when I come to this particular Bojangles they always seem to get my order wrong. I don't eat here, but my fianc√©e does from time to time & it pisses her off when a order as simple as a 2-piece isn't correct. But all in all it's fast service, but not accurate all the time."}
{"text":"they refuse to give you more than 2 sauces per order even if you offer to pay more as they say that it is not their policy. Also the worker used the restroom with her APRON on... freakin disgusting"}
{"text":"Food was good - what you would expect from this chain. Service was wonderful, with excellent staff working together, efficient, and friendly. Clean."}
{"text":"Everytime I order something there will be problems. Bought a supreme combo but when I got home and open it there's only 3 tenders in there, the drive thru speaker needs to be fixed too. Not just this time, the services are always bad. I'll  just drive up to the one in Monroe instead."}
{"text":"What? I went through the drive thru earlier today and I don't know if the girl was having an off day or tired or what. First of all, I couldn't hear her through the speaker. She was mumbling too much and when she repeated my order she literally only said, \"biscuit. bo-rounds. tea. Bo-size?\" When I pulled up to the drive thru window she just stated my total, I handed it to her, and the only other thing she said was \"tea.\" When she handed my tea to me. And there was a hair on my food.   Just. What?"}
{"text":"I rarely crave Bojangles but I did craved some dirty rice over the weekend. 2 hours before close and I asked for the grilled chicken bites. They were out for night. I ordered an order of dirty rice. They were out for the night. I almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries. I asked for a Sierra Mist fully expecting the fountain machine to be down or the Sierra Mist to be out. I'll probably try it again but if they fail a 3rd time, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Service in the drive thru line is extremely slow!!! It takes about 15 minutes from beginning to end to pick up food... I could have driven to the uptown location and gotten the food there in the same timeframe."}
{"text":"Waited a full hour for our food last night with no one else in the restaurant because the staff was unprepared and out of everything when we ordered. By the time we got our food we were so exhausted and our kids were starving so we took it home. Once we opened everything up we realized we got three containers of mashed potatoes with no gravy, paid for four orders of fries got 3, no sauce, and old green beans. I will never go back. I would have given this place a good review had we not waited and got what we ordered."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!! Pulling up to order all I can hear are the employees cussing and horsing around. I didn't know what I wanted to order yet but when I was ready I had to ask for assistance twice (all while they were still cussing and playing around) I was sitting there for a good 5 mins. When I pull up to pay it and get the food all their expressions on their face were extremely unwelcoming. I felt so awkward and uncomfortable. I was going to ask for a manager to speak my concerns but if the employees were acting like that with total disregard of customers I'm sure the manager did not care either. Someone needs to check the management here. The staff is terrible every single time."}
{"text":"Horrible Bojangles.  Waited in drive thru line for 30 min only to get home and order was totally wrong along with old, cold chicken and no receipt in box to have order replaced. Will never return to this location ever!"}
{"text":"chicken was deliciously greasy!! yummy!!! lol i could only eat it once a year. the are probably the most original place to eat home-style fried chicken. it's just sooooo gooooood!!   the service was friendly and i would it if they delivered to AZ or build one out here."}
{"text":"Flat out - sucked - and I like Bojangles - told me they dont have much chicken left 1 1/2 hours before closing except whats left over not what I call quality should be ashamed"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii so we don't have a Bonjangles at home. Every time I come to NC to visit my family I make it a point to pick up some take out from here. It was the last night of our visit so we decided to get a quick bite before we went to the airport. We decided to dine in since we had some time to kill. There was plenty of parking, the dining area was very clean and specious, all utensils, condiments, soft drinks, and teas were fully stocked. The staff was alert and friendly. Ms. Renee took great care of my family and I. They even brought our food to our table, a service you rarely receive at a fast food place. We ordered some biscuits to go and they had it ready to go by the time we finished eating. Most people expect 5 star service when dining at 5 star restaurants, but we received this type of service at a fast food place. Ms Renee and her staff are awesome! Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Im not sure why this place takes so long.  Orders are wrong, biscuits are hard, they take forever!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Filet club and the chicken was still raw in the middle!! This place should be closed for health violations! I will never go here again and will make sure none else I know does either! I would give 0 stars if I could. On top of that the person in the drive thru go the sizes wrong which can be forgivable, but not under cooked chicken!"}
{"text":"Love Bojangles; hate this location. They have the slowest service or any other B's I visit. Cannot give it higher than 2 stars because of service. Once when i visited their 'server was down' and couldn't take gift card. Food is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This particular Bojangles' has terrible business practice, starting with the Manager standing up front dancing around to the music played overhead when he should be overseeing the always incompetent and slow staff.  By incompetent I mean consistently wrong orders, mixed up orders, shorted orders.  I have relatives that come to visit once a month from TN, and we keep coming back hoping the last time was a fluke, but they maintain low standards continually.  A line of 4 people stood in front of us complaining their order was wrong, while we waited (still) for our to go order that was 30 minutes in the making.  I'll go back to the Manger's floor show.  He was dancing like a fool, letting his staff go unsupervised.  If you are the General Mgr of this store,  I suggest you clean house.  The buck stops with you."}
{"text":"Great fast food restaurant. Food tastes great, a little overpriced, but not the fault of the specific location. The employees and manager were very polite and the manager even offered me a free drink while I waited for my tailgate box to be ready. I would recommend this place to anyone and am highly likely to return there in the future."}
{"text":"Wow! They may not have honey butter chicken biscuits, but my sausage and egg biscuit blew my hometown ones out of the water. It was cheap, fast, hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Rude. Slow as hell. Girl behind the counter was high as a kite. She also couldn't get our order right and had to ask us what we wanted again repeatedly. They were also out of everything."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bojangles today to grab a quick bite and ended up not very pleased. Our order was placed at 2:16pm and around this time the dine in area was not very busy. As we were waiting for our food there were about four people that ordered after us that had received their food already. I waited patiently and just happened to peep around the counter and noticed my order just sitting there. At this time, it was 2:27pm. Several team members passed our orders a numerous amount of times including the shift manager \"Devon\" and ignored our food. As this was brought to their attention the manager replaced our sides because of the time it was spent out with team members hovering over. Not one team member, including the manager, asked whose food it was that had been sitting out. They never even called out our order or the receipt number like they did for everyone else. So, I requested that I receive my money back on my card so I can go else where to eat. Having previous experience in the restaurant field, no food should be left out with teammates hovering over it, the food order should've been called out to notify the customer of it being ready and the entire team should've never ignored the food sitting out."}
{"text":"The food here is great, when you finally get it. But I needed to write a review on the service here as this is by far the SLOWEST service at a Bojangles in the Queen City. This place is barely busy, but the workers here are so slow. They take their sweet old time to process and order whether you or in the drive thru or inside being the only person in line. The past couple of times I have had to go inside due to the slow service at the drive thru. However, I find myself waiting even LONGER being inside being the only person waiting for my food. The saddest part is watching all the employees working in slow motion w/ no care in the world.   Also, always check your bag for sauce when ordering chicken supremes, especially the family variety feast. They will not give you any sauce. I always have to park and check my order to make sure I have received the sauce. 5 out of 5 times you will not get any."}
{"text":"I agree with Beth, definitely one of the best Bo's in town.  They don't slack on the seasoning and I've never had a bad biscuit here."}
{"text":"ALWAYS \"out\" of gravy for biscuits.  I know it's not the employees' fault.  Management wants to look good to corporate so they don't make it after morning (so they don't get snipped at for making more than will be used up).  If you're going to do that, just list on the menu that you won't serve it after noon or something.  Some of us have worked in fast food and know the truth /dramatic music.  In the scope of life it's no big deal but when I want a gravy biscuit it's totally world ending."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, this place needs to close! There is never enough staff in the morning during the rush hour and often people get out of the drive through line, even if it is open,  and go elsewhere. At lunch the inside staff are so slow and rude that you would be better off going somewhere else. The dining room is always dirty and you have a better chance at winning the lottery than finding a clean table. Watching the way the staff do not practice good food handling procedures is also very disgusting. I have been a customer of this store for years and I now have to say.... I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Slowest restaurant I've seen. Just waited in the drive thru lane for 35 minuets just to see how long it wind actually take once we ordered."}
{"text":"Bojangles is basically my favorite fast food restaurant of all time. Picture this: buttery biscuits, fried chicken, dirty rice, seasoned fries, and sweet tea - god, it's amazing. For breakfast my favorite is the chicken biscuit and bo rounds (aka tater tots)..but sometimes, when I'm feeling frisky, I'll get the bo-berry biscuits..biscuits with blueberries in them covered in frosting - D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! Bojangles is my hero..."}
{"text":"Visited two years ago and got chicken that was raw inside.  Person behind counter was apathetic and did not seem surprised at all.  No apology, just want some different chicken?  Got my money back and left.   Gave them another shot a few weeks ago and I simply stood at the register, with no customers in front of me in line, for a few minutes while the employees pretty much ignored me.   They were  doing stuff but did not give so much as a \"be with you in a minute.\"   The apathy made me think I could end up with some more raw chicken so I turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"Service is slow and order is constantly wrong. Employees seem to have an attitude and seem rushed. They had better hope new fast-food restaurants don't pop up with ABC and Publix being built..."}
{"text":"I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.  I went for breakfast.  The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great.   If you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place."}
{"text":"Terribly slow and unpredictable.  Like most Bojangles.  Most of the time they are out of something we want and they have to cook it.    Sometimes (OK, frequently) they mess up our order or leave things out of it.  Which is kinda crazy given that we've had to wait for them to cook some of the food we ordered.  You would think that the extra \"7 minutes\" (which turns into 12-15-18 minutes) would give them plenty of time to fill the rest of the order.    Today I went by there early to get breakfast.  I arrived at 6:38 only to be told that they weren't open yet and would open in \"7 minutes\".  Their posted hours say they open at 5am.  So I shrugged it off and went to fill up in the meantime thinking the timing would be about right to return as they were opening.    I pulled in 8 minutes later and there were now 10 cars in the drive thru.  I was pretty committed to Bojangles at this point.  I had skipped over McDonald's and Chick-Fil-A, to say nothing of \"Rise\" down by Publix, because I wanted a sausage gravy biscuit.  So I parked and went in.  There was no one in line and after a moment someone came over to take my order.  I ordered the gravy biscuit and she walked away to check.  Nope, no gravy.  Do you have ham?  She checked and yes, they did.  She kept saying that they had biscuits (but it was apparent that some of the fillings might not be ready).  I was able to find enough that was \"ready\" to fill our breakfast order.    Here's what I don't get.  This place seems to be poorly run.  Based on the other reviews I see, that seems fair to say.  And the branch at Cotswald is similar.  It seemed that every time we went there they were \"out of chicken\" and we had to wait for them to cook it.  But the branch on Morrison Blvd, which seemed to have always run like a clock, is closed.  How is it that the only well-run Bojangles around gets shut down?  I thought maybe they were going to tear down the building but I just heard that Wendy's is opening in Bojangles old location there.    And why is this such a consistent theme with Bojangles?  I want to love them but just can't."}
{"text":"I decided to go with the 4piece boneless. It wasn't bad but they didn't have buffalo sauce which was a major let down. Biscuit was amazing as usual. Overall not bad at all."}
{"text":"Worst NC Bojangles I've ever been to and I've been to dozens across the state. Employees are slow/sluggish, appear unmotivated, the sweet tea is consistently empty in the dining area, and the most popular items are usually not prepared in high enough quantities to keep the lines moving. Would not recommend until management changes."}
{"text":"Although I live less than 1 mile from this Bojangles, every time I visit it I remember why I'd rather go to the Bojangles at exit 23. The most recent time I was told my debit card was declined in the drive through. I knew that was untrue, but was left with no choice but to leave without my order. I checked my account and sure enough my card was not declined and the transaction actually debited my account. (And yes there was plenty of money in there. I'm not a 19 year old broke kid.) I called and spoke to a manager the same day, told him the time I was there, my order, and the amount. He checked into it and apologized, said he would have my name with a note in the office the next time I came in so I could receive the food I paid for. Should have just told him to refund my transaction. This was October 2nd. Fast forward to November 11, my husband goes inside the restaurant and orders breakfast for us and attempted to redeem the manager's offer. The cashier said there was no such note and refused to assist him. My husband said forget it and paid for what should have been a complimentary meal (but not really considering I actually paid for the food weeks before). CLEARLY I wouldn't just make this up- we provided the exact details, date I was there, amount charged, order placed, and I was told there was a note with my name in the office- but since I couldn't remember the manager's name, none of that mattered. Over a $5.18 combo. Come on. You know you make more than enough as a franchise to do the right thing. And frankly, I don't eat fast food often at all- hence why it was several weeks before we returned- but still. It's not like I came in months later. Pretty disappointing even for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I like the Bojangles franchise over all, but this location serves greasy chicken which was over fried and keep under the heat lamp to long. The fries are over cooked and the rice sticky and mushy.  This is a below average place to eat. I hope they read this and some changes."}
{"text":"Walked into the store and was the only one waiting to be served. While I was placing my order I had to talk over an argument 2 employees were having in the back. Appeared to be between 2 managers. They had what looked like 3 people in the drive thru (so not very busy at all) and the kitchen was in absolute chaos. Doesnt seem like they can handle a large crowd with the chemistry they have. If its busy when you show up I would try another restaurant."}
{"text":"The service at this location is really good, but on more than one occasion, the food that I've gotten hasn't been really good.  Many times the chicken seems to be cold and the sides appear to be a little old.  The customer service is great, my only complaint is that at lot of times they try to avoid giving you a bag and put all of your order in the box.  This isn't a bad thing, I just have a pet peeve about being given greasy napkins :)  It's a known fact that if you put the napkins in the box with the fried chicken, that the napkins are gonna be saturated with grease.  Note:  The drive thru line can be a bit long on Sunday afternoons, so save yourself some time by going inside."}
{"text":"The chicken was chewy and dry. The French fries were barely warm either. I took my chicken back to the front for a new piece and the second piece was not any better. The biscuit was even small and dense. Not at all like other bojangles I have visited. The employees are nice enough but it seems they are keeping the food too long under the burner or messing up in the kitchen by over cooking."}
{"text":"Wow what a great store! Food was great...biscuit soft, steak crispy and flavorful, and cashier nice, Julie/Julia in the black shirt getting the orders out a real helpful pro. Best Bojangles in S CLT I think. I love this location."}
{"text":"The slowest and worst quality bojangles in the history of the franchise. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 piece meal which consisted of a leg, thigh, biscuit and fries. You could tell that the chicken was sitting around and re fried. It was dark, hard and not moist. The biscuit was pale and under cooked and the fries had way too much Cajun spice which made it salty and not edible. I've eaten at Bojangles many times and have always enjoyed it. Judging from the reviews this location has issues. In the future I will drive to a further location for better service."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious help. Incompetent and very unpersonable staff, dirty appearance everywhere inside, Bojangles corporate needs to set this location straight.. Wow."}
{"text":"Went to bojangle yesterday and waited like 39 minutes I asked too speak to the store manager and he was very rude me to say that they were busy but looking around they had a lot of people but they were just sitting around doing nothing"}
{"text":"When through the drive thru and it was very slow but When I got my food I it tasted really good"}
{"text":"The drive-thru cashier Micah was so friendly and always love seeing a happy face. I got my steak biscuit and it was fresh like I asked so I have no complaints"}
{"text":"It was the day after Xmas - on our way to Cozumel so we were looking for a nice bfast spot in CHarlotte airport.   My bf originally wanted some fake bagel place, but I schooled him on the ways....listen up... Anything that says \"famous\" and \"biscuits\" and sounds like jazz - u eat that no matter what.   And we did...it was glorious. The biscuit was so buttered up, it was heaven. Of course it was 10am, so we're not crazy..instead of chicken...we ordered the biscuit and sausage sandwiches. Hit the spot, put me to bed on my connecting flight.  We're so glad we experienced this treasure of Charlotte. We wanted to get this on the way back as well, but alas - customs took too long. so - NOJANGLES!"}
{"text":"Never ever again...long time wait for only 2 cars in drive thru. The young lady that took my order was so rude as if she had to wait 25 mins for a child's meal. In the back setting the employees were to busy playing around and talking about inappropriate things as we sit in the driveway. Once I received my food about 25 mins later... it was cold and not fresh at all. I vow to never waste one red penny on this location ever again."}
{"text":"Very good service. Food was fresh and hot. Went for breakfast. Pecan cinnamon twists were delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I had time to try the chicken! This review would have had higher stars probably. I only had the sausage biscuit while running between flights and wasn't about to eat chicken on the plane no matter how awesome it looked. Sausage biscuit was OK. Quick service. Will come back to try other things if I'm ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Was out for work today and happened to stop in at this Bojangle's location for a quick bite.  Right in the door, Albert made me feel right at home, and was polite, professional and absolutely engaging!  The food was ready fast, tasted great, and was made all the better by the awesome customer service!  Hungry and not in the mood for senseless chat or long waits?  Stop here for lunch, and you won't be disappointed!    Nomnomnomnom!!!"}
{"text":"They had great customer service, however the food was poorly made. I love Bojangles, but this location needs a lot of work on food preparation."}
{"text":"Fast food rarely warrants such a good rating, but Bojangles' is an exception. Figured I would give Bojangles' a try on a whim during a layover in CLT. What I discovered was by far the best fried chicken I've ever had. The fries with seasoning were good, too, as was the biscuit that I was served. I'm looking forward to hopefully eating Bojangles' again someday."}
{"text":"I wish I could put no stars. I go here all the time because it's a convenient location for me, but they mess up my order nearly every single time. Sometimes I feel like it's intentional."}
{"text":"First off, this is Bojangles so you should know what you're getting into.  Food that tastes good and is horrible for you is pretty much all you're going to get, stating that I love the place.   For some reason on weekend mornings every place around for breakfast is packed except for this place so I come in and my gravy biscuit and fries, a lot of Bojangles can't get the seasoning down but here they got it.  Lunch and dinner is usually a grilled chicken sandwich and fries or supremes (tenders) and fries.  Tried the homestyle tenders twice and the best way to put it was that they tasted odd.  Also stay away from the chicken bites, they're half fat and gristle.  Other than food the people are friendly and the place is generally clean, with fast food that's about all you can ask for.  Getting brown gravy back for the mashed potatoes would make this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst bojangles I've ever been to.  First traffic makes getting in and out hard and when you do get inside you see a store that doesn't look like it's had a major cleaning or remodel in years.  I'm the only customer there is I go to the register and service was pretty apathetic with a hint of ghetto attitude for making them work.  I get my order and see that all the tables are dirty and the floor hasn't been cleaned so it's a game of find the least nasty. Sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber.  The fries were pretty average so I ate quickly and left, no point in trying to get that mess fixed."}
{"text":"Ugh... Just visiting the area.. They are right across from the outlet mall so we had middle expectations..,...Don't think this Place did it  justice... First, after ordering , they said no Mac and cheese for sides... They ran out... Made adjustments and order meals and then a salad... Got to the window and in the unhappiness response ... Well.. The chicken for your salad will take 10 min.... So just take the other one instead.... Ugh, yes please?!?!..!?!.?.  Took it so they didn't  spit in my food.. But I don't think I will ever go back to this one..."}
{"text":"Drive thru can be a tad slow at times but..its Bojangles, and Bojangles is awesome."}
{"text":"We don't get drunk very often, but when we do, we crave bojangles to cure the hangover the following day. But this location always disappoints us. They never seem interested in serving you. They will always forget something, maybe forget your sauce, or give you unsweet tea when you definitely ordered a sweet tea because you're not a sociopath or have the sugars. But, in the off chance they somehow get your order right, the food is still the greatness that is Bojangles  Update: they always forget something. Usually the straws.  Why don't they have the same straw policy as every other fast food restaurant in the world where they give you a straw with your drink. And the forget sauces all the time too. Who's eating dry supremes? Serial killers, that's who. Bojangles creates serial killers"}
{"text":"The first time I've tried this chicken joint was when I visited my senile, obnoxious mother-in-law from the south (my wife's idea, not mine) but anyways..When I walked through the doors, the aroma of pungent tasty fried chicken and seasoned fries seeped through my nostrils and made my mouth water like the Niagra falls. A Niagra Falls of hot fresh chicken, Fries, and luscious, soft tasty biscuits was all that was in my mind. I came back into reality as the manager ask what I would like today. And like a greedy starving vulture of the wild plains of Africa, I ordered 2 twenty-piece chicken boxes, 2 baskets of fries, 3 tubs of mash potatoes & gravy, and 2 tubs of Mac & cheese. Of course it took the employees 30 minutes to prepare it; Pretty impressive if you ask me as they were as fast as Bruce Lee's hands in that movie 'Return of the Dragon' considering I just ordered half of the menu. The food was fresher than Listerine and Hotter than my trophy wife!! The food was like a slice of southern fried heaven! I let my mother-in-law taste some of this fried gold. Her face wrinkled up, her mouth watered. I thought she was going to be hospitalized from the sheer awesome tastiness of southern chicken (cross my fingers) lol just kidding. She loved it as much as I did. I will MOST DEFINITLY Come back for more the next time I visit this area. YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Not even close to the average. What's the point of a drive-thru if they don't put cream and sugar into your coffee. I mean if I wanted to do that I would of came into the joint. \"Oh we don't do that\". I mean really?  Come on. My taxes are paying your salary. Do your fucking job. Don't settle for average customer service."}
{"text":"I tried them again, and they've redeemed themselves.  I went back and the food was much better so I change my original opinion of 1 star.  The previous visit that was so horrible was a drive through visit. This last time I actually ate inside so maybe that's key."}
{"text":"We go there every weekend for breakfast.  Kids love the bo berry biscuits.   Best biscuits.  But bring your own coffee"}
{"text":"First time , last time. stopped  by the drive thru for some quick food.  Someone in the family ordered a chicken wrap and that item made it a 20 minute wait.  No big deal, we are back home in Florida and Bojangles in non-existent here."}
{"text":"5 STARS because it BOJANGLES!! We never had this caliber of fried chicken in the DC area - Popeyes coming in a very close second, mostly for their red beans and rice.   3 Stars because the dude at the register was clearly baked, even apologizing because \"his mind was elsewhere\" LOL I bet it is buddy!  No harm, no foul.... Until I get home and see that my Bo Box with split 3 regular biscuits and 3 boberries Have No Frosting?!?! How could you do me like this Mr. GanjaGuy?? Place was clean, service could've been faster but I'll just be more aware next time and check my order before I go ."}
{"text":"Bojangles Bojangles Bojangles Bojangles what a great place to get fried chicken. The chicken supreme box is my favorite along with the chicken breast in the biscuits are great as well sweet tea is pretty good almost always on point."}
{"text":"I would NOT eat here again. Not once but twice I ordered an egg, cheese, and bacon biscuit sandwich and the staff placed a biscuit sandwich with only bacon and cheese in my bag.  Imagine my total disappointment after I drove away and I sat down at my desk at work excited about my breakfast, but end up being pissed off.  The second time happened today 3/6/14 around 7:30. Not forgetting what happened last time I opened up my bag before I even pulled away and AGAIN found a biscuit with just bacon and cheese on it. I turned to the girl at the drive in window and I did not even need to speak. She said, \"I am sorry I will get you another one.\" She knew exactly what the problem was and she was smiling about it the whole time. Apparently she and the cooks are enjoying themselves at the expense of customers.  I just don't trust the place anymore and I question management's dedication to the quality of food and a responsible work culture."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely horrible!!!!!!     I have to ask for fresh fries when I'm going through the drive through if not they'll give you cold ass fries and not think nothing about it."}
{"text":"you people never fail to simply make an order correct! whether or not its your biscuits are too hard, you somehow manage to forget cheese on a \"egg and cheeeeese biscuit\", or you freakin give me someone elses food. this crap has happened at least 8 times in a row!!! this is the only bojangles  i've ever had a problem with. all these people ought to be fired"}
{"text":"Worst bojangles I've ever been to.... On multiple occasions I have sat in line at the drive thru for up to 30 minutes. In no way shape or form is this \"fast\" food. Someone that knows how to manage a \"fast\" food restaurant needs to take over and run this poorly managed establishment. If you are in a time crunch DO NOT stop here for a biscuit..."}
{"text":"If you like stale biscuits and re cooked Bo rounds this location is the one for you. Never once has this location served me anything fresh. This is my closest location and I go out of my way to avoid this one. No quality. I guess there between master biscuit makers right now. Tried one last time today and threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"Slowest Bojangles I have ever been to. After several visits for breakfast they continue to be slow.  Update 10/16/2014 When I got the window the lady was apologetic for the delay and mentioned they were short handed.  She was very pleasant as well.  I was contacted by Bojangles with an offer to \"make things right\".  I have been back since and the flow of the drive thru was much better.  I will go back because Bojangles biscuits are addicting."}
{"text":"I'm a bo regular, but this location is in bad need of quality control.  The chicken was rubbery and the fries soggy.   Even the biscuit had an odd flavor.   I feel like there is a difference in franchise vs company owned stores - the \"free ice tea\" is not offered at all his store."}
{"text":"This location is on the way to the airport but not in it. When you've come off of 85  and turned south on Billy Graham parkway - turn right at the light when you see Boyer St to access the Bojangles parking lot.   Tasty and quick. Service was friendly. Much cheaper than the airport  Bojangles. I actually went to both. Be careful if you're sensitive to msg though."}
{"text":"Bojangles offers fast food quality Cajun style fried chicken, in this case in the Charlotte Dougles International Airport. Having spent a great deal of time around the gulf coast and across Louisiana I'd like to think I have a certain appreciation for this type of food, but I experienced little of the characteristic flavor the cuisine is known for. Judged on the merits of Airport fast food, it is a worthwhile option, but apart from the excellent biscuits and heavily peppered fries, I world put it somewhere behind Popeyes in the world of fast food chicken. The main issue I had is the chicken isn't spicy at all, which puts it an incredible disadvantage to better seasoned alternatives."}
{"text":"Will not be returning. Last visit was Sunday, 10/30/16 around noon. The service was pitiful. The only two customers ahead of me both received incorrect meals. This was after waiting a long time. One of them came back up with his order and asked for his money back. Took a long time before anyone even asked my order although I was the only one at the register. When I got home, the chicken in the chicken biscuit was gross; undercooked. Two stars instead or one because working fast food is brutal."}
{"text":"This location is between Tryon and South Blvd on Woodlawn. The location isn't the best... it's somwhat inconvient with all of the traffic.   Service- Only had the pleasure of the drive- through but thought that the staff was friendly enough. Chicken was hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to the location on W Trade moments earlier and were dissatisfied with the season fries because they were hard. My sister decided to drive to this location. The seasoned fries were much better because they were fresh. The staff was pleasant and quick."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a morning bite as I've done before.  Surprisingly, the staff was  friendly, they didn't mess up the order, and the line was moving fast. I'm guessing they have new staff members because in the past I've delt with attitudes and bad service. However, the season fries were horrible. They were hard and you could tell they weren't fresh and had been sitting for a while."}
{"text":"Saturday morning would not be the same without a trip to Bojangles to get a biscuit. You know how McDonald's has been doing those commercials showing that they make fresh biscuits every morning? That's because BOJO's does! Bojangles has amazing air and fluff to their buttermilk biscuits. The biscuit actually sticks a little to the roof of your mouth as you're eating it. Then you take a swig of coffee and all is right with the world. The bo rounds... don't get me started on bo rounds they are in a separate hash brown category. They are a bit larger then chick-fil-a's and made with onions which gives them a different taste that I think we can all enjoy.   When my husband and I have that dilemma like everyone else in the world...  \"What's for dinner?\" One of our many fall backs is Bojangles. I LOVE the 2 piece meal deal with a leg and thigh and seasoned fries. YUMMY! Now the only trick is that you have to try and get the chicken right out of the fryer for it to be perfect. Otherwise the chicken looses it's crispiness. We usually pick up from this location because it's just down the street from our house. If they are out of legs or wings they are always willing to substitute. I know this is kind of weird but if you get a long fry that is warm but limp it's almost like eating the perfect french fry. Also, BOJO's sweet tea is always good as long as it's not to watered down with ice."}
{"text":"First time at bojangles,  was told I had to go.  We got there at 930pm,  Parking lot had trash in a few areas, was worried at first, until we went inside, a sweet young lady was cleaning the dining area, as soon as she saw us at the counter, she came up and asked how we were doing. Very nice hospitality service. Chicken was tasty,  not to greasy, not to dry. The tea was just like grandma's.  I will be back for more, this was a good choice"}
{"text":"I decided to spend my early Sunday breakfast at Bojangles' and it was an exceptional fast food experience. Their friendly staff greeted me as I looked over their breakfast biscuits. I decided on a Cajun filet biscuit and it was ready by the time I had walked over to the pickup area. The cashier was more than happy to fulfill my request of mayonnaise, honey mustard, and hot sauce. I found a seat in their spotless dining room and began to unwrap my biscuit.   Inside I found a perfect example of what Bojangles' chicken dreams to be. It was a perfect cut, golden fried breast of chicken. I couldn't help myself from saying \"oh my\" from the shock of how flawless it all was. I quickly applied my sauces and dove into the first bite. It was an Olympic gold medal of tender, juicy, crispy goodness. I followed it with a stroke of honey mustard on a perfectly seasoned fry. The cherry on top was a splash of Cheerwine, a rare drink to find eating out. A lady taking care of patrons' empty trays asked me how I was doing as she passed by. \"Very well\" was an understatement, but it was all I could say with my attention fully focused on ballet of flavors dancing on my tongue. Every bite was an encore. Each fry gave a signature. I enjoyed the pleasure of refilling my Cheerwine at their self-serve fountain.   There wasn't more than a smear of sauce left from my last bite on the wrapper. The lady asked for my tray and I thanked her for her excellent service."}
{"text":"Worst bojangles in history. It will take at least 20 minutes to get to the window. Staff will be cutting up and dancing inside when 8 cars are in line and have been waiting for a long time. Should be called slowjangles."}
{"text":"Sign says theh open at 5am. Sat at menu board for 7 minutes past, yet the intercom was still berating me incessantly that \"the store is closed, please come again.\" #IWont  Oh then when I finally cracked and drove to the window, the guy said it was going to be several more minutes, and that they were still setting up. I asked if I could sit here until he was ready but he said no (even though another car was now in line) because I was running up his drive thru time... I'm thinking wtf? You aren't even open yet, how is that even a thing. Bojangles should reexamine their performance metrics. The heck if I'm now willing to wait for your lateness AND be second in line."}
{"text":"Oh boy...do I love some Bojangles!  I'm not going to waste your time saying all the great things about the food at Bojangles that have already been said.  A smile and a friendly voice could improve things here."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Had to wait 15min for fresh food. They gave me my biscuit, but fries were cold by then, so i asked for new fries and Makayla got an attitude about it. I started to wait for my fries and she said i should go eat my biscuit now because they wont give me a fresh one. 8 min later i asked are the fries done and she said idk and kept cleaning. Didn't even look. Fires were done and she called me over. Wasn't even nice enough to bring them to me. Someone needs to fire this girl."}
{"text":"I really love bojangles and this one is my go to one, however there are times when the service can be very slow in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Employees at this location are very rude I had a young lady by the name Alexis making fun of me in front of my face yesterday afternoon I'll never go back again"}
{"text":"I love Bojangles, but this location does not treat it's customers very well.  They refused to accept a coupon because they were not a \"participating location\". There wasn't anything on the coupon to indicate it was restricted.  There was no manager at the site to talk to about the situation.  Not a good decision to create bad customer relations to save 99 cents."}
{"text":"Memorial Day hungry and craving Bojangles. Out of Supremes, out of fries, out of mashed potatoes. Seems like they just decided they weren't going to cook anymore after they ran out of stuff. To top it off, drive through attendant had a stank attitude! Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"It's Bo-time!   The restaurant is clean and the food is always good!    Great for the days you don't feel like cooking and want something cheap!"}
{"text":"Bojangles has decent enough chicken but, this review is for the cajun chicken club sandwich.  In a city awash with chicken sandwiches the cajun chicken club is alone at the top of the mountain.  It could stand to have a little more heat but, it's deliciousness can't be denied. I'm happy to eat one whenever but, I get a little sad when I finish one!"}
{"text":"This place is the worse Bojangles I have ever went to spoke to manager district manger nothing is changing! They gave me an excuse of young kids working! They always make to order wrong or it's always missing pieces!"}
{"text":"Bojangles is bo-mazing. The biscuits are some of the best I have ever had and they serve them all day! The chicken is quite good and the seasoned fries are delicious. The staff at bojangles is always friendly and polite. I go here every time I visit from California."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of fast food until now. The fried chicken was crispy yet tender, the mashed potatoes were smooth, the biscuits were crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. My god why doesn't Bojangles come on down to SF?!"}
{"text":"So this Bo was closest to my house, so I had to go with it, but pretty much standard for all Bojangles!    The food is super greasy and super yummy.  Come on, you have to admit you know it's going to be good when you see that grease seeping through the bag!    I always get the same thing.  \"Cajun Filet Biscuit Combo, French Fries, Iced Tea\" as they say over the loud speaker.  You have to get extra seasoning if it's sitting out, because the spices are the best!  And this is the only place I drink sweet tea.     I'm planning a visit to NC and Bojangle's is on the top of my list to visit!"}
{"text":"What is the point of ordering ahead if you still have to wait 20 minutes when you get there? I ordered 25 sausage biscuits an hour ahead. I checked three days before that they could do it. On a timeline early in the am, and they are moving at a snail's pace! Go to McDonalds!!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying, I am not a huge fried chicken fan, but myyyyy goodness! If I eat here enough I may be converted! (...and very plump)  This was the best fried chicken with a little bit of spiciness and delicious bicsuits! MMmmmmmm  I feel like I would ruin it by saying more: so please, just got eat some delicious fried chicken here. It is fresh, delicious, and the perfect amount of crisp and spice!"}
{"text":"Being from the south, I love me some homemade biscuits and fried chicken! Literally everything at Bojangles is delicious. The biscuits are warm and fluffy, the chicken is well-seasoned, and the tea is sweeeeeeeet. I personally enjoy the bo cinnamon biscuits or sausage and cheese biscuits for breakfast and for lunch definitely the chicken supreme combo. The chicken supreme includes four chicken tenders, fries, and a biscuit. I recommend their awesome honey mustard as a dipping sauce. Their fried chicken is great as are their side dishes including mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. There are only two things I don't like at Bojangles, their bo rounds and their green beans. Although these two side dishes could have knocked their score to four stars, the fries and mac and cheese definitely make up for it. Please order the sweet tea with any and every entree."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! First, we tried to order the Cajun filet club sandwich and the girl had no clue what we were taking about (it's on the menu). Next we were told to pull up, worst thing you can agree too. There was already a car waiting. We were told to pull around then, which blocked their drive-in line. After 20 minutes we finally got our food. Of course, it was not what we wanted, the club. Go to another bojangles. This one is poorly run."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean.  However, they have messed up  my order too many times to mention.   Service is very slow.  If you like Bojangles like me find another location."}
{"text":"Staff is at best disinterested.3rd visit. Tried their\"fish\" sandwich that they advertise as being not square. Well that was the most square frozen piece of tasteless fish I've had in sometime. I'm not sure what is keeping this store open other than the biscuits. Wayyyy below standards in every category. French fries were tasteless and soggy. Tea was sour. Franchisee should have store taken away or go back and learn how to run it. If I could rate less than 1 this place deserves it."}
{"text":"This is my hometown Bojangles and in my opinion the best.  The dirty rice is always fresh and the biscuits soft.  It was one of the only restaurant chains open during Hurricane Hugo so it has a special place in my memory.  Bojangles started in Charlotte and is great for tailgates or any occasion."}
{"text":"Hood. Owner and manager were discussing the employee problems loudly in the middle of the dining room with customers around. Drive thru slow in the mornings."}
{"text":"If any airport fast food joint is this good, I could only imagine how it would taste at an actual location.   I don't really order fast food a lot, so I was surprised how quickly I actually did get my food. Really quickly.   The woman taking my order was really patient when I ordered a Cajun biscuit then added egg and then added cheese.   To be honest, if I didn't order it from a fast food stand and it wasn't in a wrapper, I wouldn't have necessarily known it was fast food.     Yep, this is worth a stop for sure in the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"Really poor service and always understaffed. The reason I go to chick fil a.  Ten times the customers and twice as fast.  Crazy."}
{"text":"I ate here after a long red-eye from San Diego and before getting on a teensy commuter flight, so maybe my two-star review is due to my general long flight grumpiness and not necessarily due to Bojangles' food. But:   1) The hasbrowns / tater rounds thingies were grotie, greasy, soggy and pretty tasteless, and seemed like they had applied for jobs as hash browns at Burger King and were rejected, so came to Bojangles instead.  2) The \"breakfast chicken biscuit\" - which I'm pretty sure is just the name of the chicken biscuit when served before 10am, because it's just (wait for it, big suspense here) a piece of chicken on a biscuit - was just ok.  The biscuit was fluffy but dry, and the chicken was pretty dry too.  Tasty, but dry.  3) The ice tea was gooood.  So there's that."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Bojangles biscuits and chicken.   This location of Bojangles is apparently privately owned or somehow not managed by Bojangles.   This Bojangles is awful. I stopped by to pick up a sandwich for my brother last week. The chicken appeared to have been cooked days ago. I asked for a packet of mustard and was told it would be .15 cents. REALLY?  I live close to this Bojangles but I will never go there again. Don't judge Bojangles by this location!"}
{"text":"Perfect Fried Chicken  I usually end up in Concourse B and it makes me so happy to be next to the Bojangles. Their chicken is perfect. It's crispy, juicy, savory all the way through, and a little spicy. The dirty rice is great too.   The only thing I can complain about is the biscuit. It doesn't split into two and it's not flakey, but that's ok because the chicken is amazing.  This Bojangles is enough reason to fly through CLT.   Food 5/5 Value 4/5"}
{"text":"This location is clean but extremely slow. I've also rarely gotten my correct order. They run out of gravy and potatoes a lot and don't seem to care to make more. It's not horrible but other locations I've been to in the area are much faster and pay more attention to your order."}
{"text":"This store has got to be the rudest the most incompetent and the dirtiest store I've ever visited I come here half the time they don't get the order right take that back 3/4 of the time they don't get the order right come to the window yet to correct her math they overprice the managers do nothing to fix these problems I will not be visiting the store again and I come here regularly I've had enough of it no chicken legs today out of fish I don't compensate it so screw this Bojangles"}
{"text":"I don't know why they have bad reviews, we're real customers and highly recommend this place. The ladies bathroom was clean as were the tables in the eating area. But go for the chicken which is sooooo good & they have honey for the buiscits. I had a side of cole slaw while my daughter got the green beans and mashed potatoes. Mikeem, who rang up our meal, was nice and friendly. He even gave us extra butter for the mashed potatoes.....the way to our hearts!"}
{"text":"Just passing through on my way to Orlando and had a chicken n egg biscuit. Hot, tasty and quick service with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have gone a couple of times before but last week was horrible. Our food was cold, place look dirty, bathroom was overflowing of papers on the floor. Bad. No iced tea available and our order looked sloppy in our plates. Employees were not paying attention to customers they were joking around.  Will not return. At least at this location."}
{"text":"The line is alwayslomg and slow! The people at the drive through are not the friendliest and don't even apologize for the wait.  Often my biscuit is hard but who wants to go back and complain after waiting forever.  I will say that when they are on, they are on. And when they are off, they are off"}
{"text":"This is the worst Bojangles I have ever been to!! We came here on a Saturday morning to get breakfast. Ordered the Cajun chicken biscuit and bo rounds. But they were old and stale. The chicken was rubbery and the potato rounds were mushy and had a stale taste. I only took one bite and threw it away. Avoid this Bojangles at all cost!!!!"}
{"text":"Eat at this location often, I tried the cinnamon biscuits for the first time. Ohmygoodness!! The best ever! Chicken, vegetables, season fries, and the biscuits are out of this world. Fresh and hot every time. Now in love with the dessert biscuits. Overall, this older Bojangles rocks, the workers are super friendly, clean and tidy,great food, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Our family has a thing for Bojangles and upon our visit to this location, we were very disappointed. The customer service was unfriendly, rushed us at the drive thru speaker with no other cars in line, got our order wrong, the bo rounds were drenched soggy in grease and the Large and Medium size was filled with the same amount (what's the point of paying extra for a Large?). The only saving grace was that the biscuits were very good. After we left, we looked online and saw this location had a one star rating...we certainly hope it can improve."}
{"text":"Lower quality than most bojangles and $9.00 for a 4 supreme.  Also charged extra for sauce and took kids supreme off the menu.  Worst bojangles out there."}
{"text":"I understand that the man helping me in the counter was not as happy or enthusiastic, with it being 5:30 in the morning. Service was okay.   I wanted to bring some Bojangles home to California with me and got biscuits and chicken. I had to eat some on the plane! The food was delicious!    I definitely recommend their food and wished I got a breakfast sandwich. This is one local treat!"}
{"text":"Painfully slow experience at the drive thru. Basically just serving one car at a time.  Needs to step up coordination and order taking skills."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken in the airport...super greasy, it taunts your arteries as it slips down your mouth hole and lands in your stomach to fester. Yummy!"}
{"text":"We have stopped at this location twice. Both times we had to wait on our food. Cheddar Bo biscuits are made to order instead on the line.  They ran out of biscuits & we had to wait 7 minutes for them to make more. I don't understand how this happens someone is not paying attention to their products."}
{"text":"The guy working there tonight made my day! Just flew in from California and picked up some wings. Classic southern hospitality. Thanks"}
{"text":"So, I love Bojangles. I just don't love this location. No matter what time I go, there is always a line - YAY BOJANGLES. And that isn't my issue. My issue is that no matter how long the line is, there is NEVER an employee at the register the entire time. They walk away with no acknowledgement as to what they are doing. Today I went in for lunch. I took a late lunch and got there around 2:15pm. Most people are done with lunch by then. I witnessed 3 employees just standing there watching the line grow. The managers were working their butts off - but the girl at the register was so concerned about taking her break that she just walked away with a handful of us in line waiting to order.  The manager walks up and says \"Oh, I didn't realize there wasn't someone up here.\" Never an apology. I was second in line and stood there a good 10 minutes before any of us were ever helped.  I used to come to this location all the time because I worked 2 blocks away - before they had their fire (or whatever it was that caused them to close down for a few months) they were so great and I loved going to this location. But ever since they reopened it just hasn't been the same."}
{"text":"You guys serve the worst fucking coffee in the world. On the bright side, the woman who gave me 45 sugar packets and 6 creamers was clearly letting her enthusiasm for her job shine through. I appreciate a go-getter."}
{"text":"I have to write another review on this place.  It is located inside the Airport here in Charlotte,NC. ,even though it has a lot of calories..it is fantastic!  This time i got the Chicken strips with French Fries. It was as always so good! The line is long, because,it is so good. But, they are very quick and you get your food fast. The price is not that bad, and it is in the airport which is high to begin with. But, I think Bojangles price is not that bad. It is good and it is nice and hot. Always fresh, because they are doing such great business, nothing has time to sit around."}
{"text":"This store has to be be the slowest fast food place ever! It doesn't matter the day or time, or how simple the order is, there always seems to be a delay and an apology. It is unsettling to see employees not wearing hairnets with all the loose hair flopping around. Management needs to get this together."}
{"text":"This Bojangles is the closest one to my house. Went there for the first time through the drive-thru and there was some disappointments. The line and wait wasn't long, only took a few minutes. The biscuit was nice, warm and fluffy. The chickens, however, was super salty! I had only ate a wing and I had already drank over a bottle of water! The girl at the drive-thru window was also cheap as hell. I asked for ketchups and hot sauce and she only gave me 2 packets of each. How the hell are we supposed to eat 8 pcs of fried chickens with only 2 packets of ketchups and 2 packets of hot sauce?!"}
{"text":"So sue me, I love the breakfast biscuits.  Not the healthiest choice but because they are right by 77, access can't be beat. I've never been inside this location but drive thru has always been prompt  (I go in the early hours and not at night so I can't comment on the night service) .  Biscuits are always warm and delicious. Coffee is meh but I usually just doctor it with sweetener and cream."}
{"text":"Ah! Back in the land of the Southern Breakfast Biscuit!   Oh how I have missed you my little Bojangles!!!!   Back in high school, we'd stop by a Bojangles almost every morning for their yummy biscuits - the perfect way for a Southern Belle to start her day   After moving to San Fran, I sadly discovered they had no Breakfast Biscuits of any kind & certainly NO Bojangles   (there is also no Dunkin Donuts, but that's another review)   So when work brought me to Charlotte, I squealed like a little schoolgirl when I saw not one but TWO Bojangles near where I'm staying!   Beware this location does not serve breakfast all day - but they do serve the biscuits   But this doesn't even distract me from a full-on 5 star review b/c I stopped by in the morning for my Egg & Cheese Biscuit & again in the afternoon for their Seasoned Fries   That biscuit was the doughiest, fluffiest, buttermilkiest biscuit I've had in like forever   Their fries are the BEST on the planet, hands down & those of you who are lucky enough to have Bojangles in your lives know what I'm talking about....crispy on the outside & mooshy on the inside w/ a TON of seasoned salt.  Sccccccrumptious!!!   No diet food here - only the most delish down-home southern fried treats around!!   I HEART Bojangles!!!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Bojangles from my stay in Charlotte!  What made it so great you may ask....  Bigger Biscuits - larger, hotter & fresher Egg & Cheese Biscuit.  Still doughy, moist & buttermilky but more of it!  Seasoned Fries - available in the morning & when I'm at the airport & needing to catch a 9 AM flight, I really could not care less that it's 7:30 AM - I *still* want my Seasoned Fries & this location delivers!!  Hot, tender & loaded w/ seasonings  For those who want their yummy spicy chicken at 7:30 AM, how awesome that it's there & ready for you  Overall this was the 1 location where I didn't have to make 2 trips b/c 1 item was there & the other wasn't due to be categorized as b-fast vs lunch & I didn't have to leave work to make a special venture for BOTH my Biscuit & Fries......1 stop shopping & bigger portions  Fantastic way to greet your arrival to Charlotte or send you off in the YUMMIEST way possible!!"}
{"text":"finally had me some bojangles....yummy yummy in my tummy...the chicken tasted great, gravy, taters, rice was all good too....those biscuits they give you are ginormous!"}
{"text":"Stopped over while my layover in Charlotte and ordered 2pc. leg & thigh combo w/mashed potatoes & biscuit. I literally let out a loud \"hhhhmmmm\" with my first bite of the leg. It was juicy, crispy, and a hint of cajun pepper, it was delicious. Mashed potatoes gravy isn't watered down like KFC and the biscuit tasted fresh.  Too bad I only ordered 2 pcs, which was plenty but I could have eaten more if I was starving. I wish there is a franchise in LA! KFC will go out of business real quick."}
{"text":"You HAVE to stop here in the Charlotte Airport if you ever are here to transfer flights or such. I came here twice, and both times I haven't been disappointed!   The 2 piece combo is so delicious. The leg and thigh are both freakin' juicy and the breaded skin is amazing and crunchy. Actually if you think the thigh is too oily, you can ask for 2 leg pieces.  The biscuit is good, not too buttery (make sure you get the honey packets to dump on it!!) YUM. I tried the dirty rice, pretty good with hot sauce, the beans were not my cup of tea, and I've had better cole slaw, but the cole slaw was refreshing. Fries were well seasoned, and the sweet tea was delicious! Honestly, I just love the chicken here, better than anything I've had before. I even looked on their site to see if they had any locations near Cali, but sadly it's just in the southern and east coast regions.   Anything with the word \"Famous\" in the title, you gotta try at least once! This was definitely worth it. Til next time Bojangles, til next time.."}
{"text":"Wow true southern food in an airport in the south! Right?   Seems racist lol but food was good. Long line of fat white people. It was really creepy but the food was yummy. Chicken was so yummmmmy   I was feeling sick at this airport but once I eat the chicken my sickness went away. Thank you Mr bojangle for curing me with your powers of the south.   If I have layover again here I'll come here for sure! Cool."}
{"text":"I'll drive to Concord and wait in long lines for Popeye's or even look like a fool and visit the one inside the food center at Winthrop. They used to have spicy chicken because Texas Pete just doesn't do it for me.  Why is this such a difficult concept?  At least their breakfast is OK if you get it fresh.  I always try to order a biscuit I don't see already prepared and sitting in the holding bins.  They also honor their coupons unlike the rude staff that is dismissive at the one across from SouthPark stating \"we don't have to being a franchise.\""}
{"text":"Giving this bojangles one star only because the food is good. But I swear, why does it take 20 minuets each time I come here to get a chicken biscuit?! That's all bojangles makes!"}
{"text":"Starving on the way home and Bojangles is the only option coming from uptown. It was 10:26 and tried to order something. \"We're out of chicken.\" Um, what? Whether you didn't want to make more or you aren't capable of ordering food it doesn't really matter. Unacceptable. The last time I was there I was waiting for my food for over 20 minutes and swore I'd never go back. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment."}
{"text":"Absolute worst Bojangles in Charlotte. Always understaffed and slow. The people that do work there are rude. If you can get your order taken, it will be wrong. Poorly managed and ownership is clearly absent."}
{"text":"Delicious, juicy fried chicken, although both the chicken and sides are not as good as Popeyes.  The skin crisps up quite well and the salt content isn't completely overwhelming (although I was still shocked at the 3000mg of sodium I consumed in a SMALL box of chicken).  Try it if you are in the greater Charlotte area and need to eat some NC soul food."}
{"text":"This is my first time here since the remodel. I stopped by after running an errand to get a salad. Yeah, a grilled chicken salad lol. The manager told me there would be a 6 minute wait for the chicken. He offered alternative suggestions if I didn't want to wait. I didn't mind. It gave me time to write up this review with pictures. :) I did notice that when your food is brought out to you (if you're dining in) the person also has a fully stocked tray from napkins to hot sauce to honey....so you won't have to get up to get anything. That's a nice touch. Something you don't see at a fast food place...not even chick fil a."}
{"text":"We had a layover in Charlotte so my bf wanted to try their chicken. We got an order of their biscuit steak sandwich and their chicken sandwich. Both were just okay, but I wish we got the fried chicken instead.  However, my bf said it looked like it's been sitting there for a while. My favorite part of the meal were the fries which had Cajun seasoning on it."}
{"text":"Serve with a huge biscuit, at least bigger than colonel Sanders. I like the sizzling hot dark chicken and their side rice (very seasoned), although less salt would make them better.  Location is convenient for a lay over lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I had to get a snack before my flight and Bojangles was right next to my terminal. Since I don't like biscuits, the menu is quite limited so I got some hashbrowns. Food was good (hot and not over or under done) and service was decent."}
{"text":"Worst service/employees at this location. I just drove away after waiting 5 minutes for the drive thru employee take my order, which he never did. When I drove past the window him and another female employee seemed to be cutting up and playing around. For being in such a prime location/area you would think they could step up there service. I guess that's what you get when you have management that doesn't care about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Wow. Fast food? NOT!!! This was THE slowest service ever. One employee was taking orders AND FULFILLING the orders. There was absolutely NO sense of urgency.  The tables in the dining area are filthy and the floors are sticky.  This place needs serious help.  Oh and this is 9:30 on a THURSDAY morning. Smdh  Never again."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes during lunch on a Sunday. Then when I finally pulled up to order I sat there for another couple of minutes waiting until I was finally met with 'what do you want'. Really?   Every other bojangles I've ever been to is quick and efficient and friendly. Get your crap together."}
{"text":"I had a connecting flight in Charlotte, which gave me time to indulge in Bojangles. Bojangles is always a \"must stop\" for me whenever I'm in the Carolinas, so I was more than happy to get my fill of chicken, biscuits, and seasoned fries. I just wish that they had the half gallon of sweet tea that I could have taken with me :/"}
{"text":"Horribly slow service! The staff is fidgety and the drive thru make this feel like anything but fast food!  Aside from that the drinks and very biscuits are okay"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken sandwich w/ no mayo is only 230 calories! && I love their country ham biscuit for a quick on-the-go breakfast @ 270 calories!"}
{"text":"I had a connecting flight in Charlotte, which gave me time to compare the famous Bojangles to Popeyes!  I was thrilled to get my fill of chicken, biscuits, and seasoned fries. The chicken was high quality and the batter was crispy but kinda bland. It's not seasoned at all, I would say. The biscuit is really soft but just tasted old. The fries were good and well seasoned with Cajun. I just I had tried the half gallon of sweet tea. Completely forgot to try that!! I also would like to give another locaton of this chain a chance. Maybe the one at the airport didn't do it justice."}
{"text":"First time and LAST time EVER going to this Bojangles or any in the future! Rude drive thru service. Watched my food I'm a bag be thrown to the next worker while they both laugh their heads off. Called for the manager who honestly looked like she rolled out of bed! Yuck and yuck!"}
{"text":"Extremely unsatisfied with the food from this bojangles. The chicken tenders were way undercooked and my boyfriend got sick!!! They also gave us regular fries instead of seasoned fries"}
{"text":"considering that this is \"fast food\" i would expect fast service. the drive thru should especially be provided with the fastest service possible. with that being said, if i ordered something that was not ready or was going to take a while, i should be advised of that when i order it and before i pay for it. if i do have to wait for the food i paid for after i was expecting to get it right after i pay for it..atleast have your employees apologize for the wait...also check your cleanliness at this location."}
{"text":"One great thing about The South is Bojangles!  I never expect much out of fast food establishments at the airport, but this place had their s - - t together! Breakfast was the sausage biscuit combo with the tater rounds, or whatever they named em, and then...I couldn't resist - testing their side of grits...hey, I'm in the South, remember?   They were awesome!  slow-cooked...not the instant crap you get up North or at any Cracker Barrel.  Really hit the spot, and was a good way to say, \"Bye, Ya'll\" to Tha South!"}
{"text":"It wouldn't be right to have an airport in Charlotte without a Bojangles. And, as long as you cruise midway through the B gates, you'll find this state's best known fast food chain. Does the food inside the confines of the airport rival that dished out in traditional locations? Some days, yes. Others no.   There's a lot of inconsistency here. For example, at 7am this morning, I ordered a Chicken Supremes combo and so did my buddy, less than 30 seconds apart from each other. His was ready in 30 seconds. Mine took 10 minutes. His fries were much better than mine. Meanwhile, if you are a fan of Bojangles you'll be content. For the most part the menu is the same and as expected prices are higher than in a non-airport location.   Meanwhile, where else can you get a Pecan Twist, Bo-Berry Biscuit and sweet tea to take on the plane? If you're in the mood for fast food, you'll be served well here. And, unlike many other vendors in this airport, the line moves quickly.   If you're a Bojangles newbie, try the Cajun Fillet Biscuit in the morning and the Chicken Supremes combo (they are better than the Homestyle Tenders) with fries and a sweet tea later in the day. Ask to upgrade the biscuit to a Pecan Twist. Do so and this will become one of your favorite fast food chains."}
{"text":"I've been to half of the Bojangles in the South, literally, over the last decade. However, having flown a friend in from Northern California, this would be his first. We stayed at the hotel down the street and came here for lunch.   Ironically, he looked at the front and told me this was no different than a KFC back home. I laughed. And, after his first bite he revoked those words, admitting Bojangles is no ordinary fast-food.   I ordered him the Chicken Selects combo with fries, cole slaw, two Bo-Berry Biscuits and a Pecan Twist. He ate them all. And, told me this is no ordinary fast food.   He's right. It's Bo-Time!"}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because I could do worse at an airport.     ---   ---   ---  Like any insanely obsessed foodie, I used my $8 in-flight WiFi to look up the Charlotte airport's food options so I could have at least an hour to decide on what I was going to eat for lunch. I was going to go with the Mongolian Grill until I noticed Bojangles. I have a friend from North Carolina that has pimped Bojangles for years, so my choice was pretty obvious.  I took about 617 people movers from my terminal to BoJ's, and my conclusion is this: while it's really good, I wish it could be slightly more about quality than fast foodish. The idea of warm biscuits and fried chicken is so obvious, it made me wonder why more places are not based around this heavenly combination of comfort food.   It was delicious, but the lack of a 5th star is due to just a bit much on the layers of fried breading before reaching the chicken.  You take those biscuits with Publix or PDQ fried chicken? My God... I'd be flying to Charlotte just for a stop at BoJangles."}
{"text":"So, here we are in Charlotte, the home of Bojangles. My mother had never been to one or tasted their fried chicken, and it seems like the area really loves their fried chicken, so we had decided to give it a shot.  The first Bojangles we went to over on Wilkinson Blvd turned out to be closed for the day (it was only around 7pm... no idea why they would be closed). So we continued on over to this one on Billy Graham Pkwy... and ran into issues there as well.   Walking up to the door to eat inside, it turned out to be locked up and closed, despite the sign stating that it was open until 10pm. The drive-thru was running, so we kind of wiped our hands of eating in the restaurant and settled for eating in our hotel room instead, and drove around to the drive-thru... where we proceeded to wait for a good five minutes at the speaker with the request of \"could you give me a couple of minutes? I need to take care of some things first\". Yeah... five minutes of waiting with no one at the window or anything else, just waiting to get our order in.  Finally the guy is able to take our order, and we get it in (simple two piece order for sampling) and drive up to the window... at which point we are finally able to figure out why things were so slow. There was only one guy working the entire store... either a scheduling mix-up or folks had just been fired, but whatever the case it was just one person handling everything. He was able to get us our order properly, which was nice.  Now on to the food. The chicken wasn't too bad, though I have had better. By the time we got it to our hotel room it was getting a bit cold, but fried chicken should be able to handle going cold without any real issue. The chicken itself was tasty, as it is supposed to be marinated for a good number of hours. The biscuit that came with it was decent as well, not too buttery, fluffy, and good. For the side I had requested the macaroni and cheese, and it is the typical thing you would get from a restaurant.  All in all, not bad in the actual food department. I am really hitting them for their service issues."}
{"text":"I gave this 1 star only because I can't give it 0 stars. This is the worst bojangles, and restaurant in general, I've ever been to. I waited in line for 30 minutes to get my food and waited another 5 minutes for my drinks. The biscuits are thin and the fries were unseasoned. You'd think if you're going to take 20 minutes from the time I placed my order to the time you handed me my food, you'd have time to get the order correct.   I saw the signs saying they are hiring. Maybe they should look for new management instead."}
{"text":"Bad service.   We've counted each time we go there to see if it was isolated. We're at 5 consecutive visits where this place fails. Whether it's a wrong order, bad attitudes or taking 15 minutes for a drive thru order, they've done it all. I have yet to encounter any friendly employees, which is sad because Cotswold and midtown are always super friendly.   Tip: Make sure to double check your order when you get it. Check everything. Even if you said it 3 times in the order, odds are they still screwed it up."}
{"text":"Bojangles is awesome every time I am in North Carolina I do try to go to Bojangles at least once. This time I went to the one on Josh Birmingham Parkway because of its location close to my hotel. Perfect experience food was quick and delicious."}
{"text":"This is place takes forever. Always forget something that you ordered. Seriously. Do better. It's fried chicken not rocket science."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy chicken sandwich.  Just enough spice to add the flavor. The fries where COLD and soggy. Disappointed.  The staff here was very polite and friendly.  Always smiling."}
{"text":"Bojangles used to be some of the best chicken in Charlotte, well I see a lot have changed- JJ's Fish is much better"}
{"text":"If you think KFC is better than Bojangles' you need to move your ass back to Vermont or Minnesota. Bojangles' brings it each and err'y time and they care about your meal. Popeye's is close to Bojangles' but BOJ dirty rice beats Popeyes red beans and rice every time. love me that spicy bird."}
{"text":"- Mac & Cheese was what you expect from a Fast Food restaurant.  - The ground beef in the Dirty Rice was a little burned.  There was  too much salt or too many spices, I couldn't finish it.   - The same was true with the 2Pc meal I ordered.  I had to remove the skin (cooking oil dripping from it) to get pass the salt or spices.   - But the Mountain Dew was great ;-)"}
{"text":"Yes, it's your basic Bojangles...but in the growing area of Midtown.  That means it's a \"nice\" one.  After shopping at the new Metropolitan area (Target, Home Depot design center, West Elm, Trader Joe's, etc.), you can swing by this new nearby Bojangles and grab yourself a chicken or breakfast biscuit.  Egg and country ham for me, please!  I love that they offer breakfast ALL DAY.  Breakfast sandwiches are all that I really enjoy at fast food restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, so to have that option anytime I want is Bojanglicious!"}
{"text":"The smell of Bojangles is usually enough to make me bury my nose in a cup of coffee as I anxiously await my flight out of The South. My stomach turns at the thought of eating a greasy biscuit for breakfast, let alone a biscuit with bacon, syrup, and something resembling a sausage. But then some mornings, for reasons unknown, I cannot resist it. Deep-fried steak on a deep-fried biscuit? I shouldn't..."}
{"text":"I succumbed to temptation when I saw the line, which noticeably included several  airport staff and a pilot.  I figured their endorsement was a good sign.  I got fried chicken with dirty rice & a biscuit.  Everything was tasty.  Plus they are very fast.  The butter (as if the biscuit recipe wasn't loaded with butter already) was 'buttery spread' instead of real butter. I'd skip that, but otherwise A-OK.  Plus good views of the planes parked at the terminal."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the only Bojangles near my home. The supremes were tender and not dry! So those were great, but the restaurant and serving line was disgusting.. there was trash on the tables and floor. The food (esp. mashed potatoes) looked old and the utensils were laying around on the counter. The napkin and drink station was extremely messy and sticky.   The staff seemed like they did not care how long it took to get the food out. And there was 5+ people waiting in their food (we waited at least 10-15 minutes for our chicken supremes). If we didn't just drive back from KY, EXTREMELY hungry and craving Bojangles, we would've gone somewhere else. I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Standard Bojangles food. Nice atmosphere, like a carpeted foodcourt. There are other restaurants nearby (and a DQ) so you have choices."}
{"text":"I really like the Bojangles' near my home. They are clean and fast. I don't feel like I have to worry about getting salmonella poisoning. As far as fast food chicken goes, I like Price's Chicken Coop better but it's too far away. My son loves their french fries."}
{"text":"Most of the time they do not have the pieces that you want. Especially, 30 mins to an hour before they close. They need a sign that says, may not have chicken at this chicken resturant. But when they do its pretty good. But only one star because, you get excited about a 3 wing dinner and they tell you we do not have wings or it will take 20 minutes. This is sad!"}
{"text":"They are too busy talking to their friends and taking phone calls to help the customers. One of the worst customer experiences I have had at Bojangles."}
{"text":"4 stars for fresh food... 930p Friday night not sure why they don't have anything ready and takes a while for certain items. Very clean dinning room and very nice staff! Will be back of course can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Akways something wrong.  Don't know why continue to visit this location.  Dirty rice side was dry and tasted burnt. Didn't give the desired dipping sauce for tenders.  Wrong drinks.  The employee taking the drive thru order sounded like she didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"The steak biscuit was questionable and with fries and a drink was 7 bucks. Only positive was that the fries were hot. Otherwise, pass and go to bagel company next door."}
{"text":"Drive through...Honey mustard not placed in bag. I was asked about sauce, sauce was on the receipt, but no sauce in the box. When you have no sauce to dip your supremes in, then really there is no supremes."}
{"text":"Service was quick yet not friendly. Chicken was decent and their honey mustard is really good. Biscuit was eh."}
{"text":"What has happened to this Bojo's?  When it first opened it was good quality all the time..  Obviously managers and cooks come and go BUT surely there are guidelines to make sure food is cooked and served  the Bojangles way...per TV ads no matter if it's a franchise or corporate owned.  If you are lucky, you might get chicken that is right...hot, crispy and juicy. ....Most times it is hot, BUT dry as if cooked day before.  Biscuits can be right or fall apart after one bite.   Fries can be good OR limp .   Hope the kitchen is consistent and gets good clean marks...I worry.  Convenient to work BUT hope KFC moves closer!!  BTW,  the friendly professional man who used to take orders couple of years ago is greatly missed.  Hope they get their act together....would like to enjoy eating on the nice patio with my coworkers....IF I can convince them to return."}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food chain I have ever been to. I work at the mall across the street. I always think I should give them another shot and I am always disappointed. I should have known not to go when I saw two customers walk out of the store and tell two approaching people not to go there."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location, the drive thru employees are rude. I haven't been in awhile because of this, after today I will not go back. Drove up and the person said just a moment, waited 5 minutes and then said excuse me.. Just a second.. Several minutes went by..nothing. I finally left, I'll take my business elsewhere. At least say sorry for the delay and check if I'm still there, instead of completely ignoring me."}
{"text":"I walk into Bojangles and there's no one at the front counter. I go use the bathroom. Still no one. At this point I'm sooooo tempted to grab the mic and place my order. \"Chicken filet and Bo rounds to go\".  This quite literally would have made my day/week/year.   I'm in a bit of a rush and I'm picking this up for a friend (hangover cure all) so I try to find someone to help. She says it will be a minute. She then takes a drive up order (!) although there are two of us now at the counter.   I finally placed my order and the woman who helped me and the other woman who gave me my order were very nice. I hate to give a bad review but if you go be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Charlotte airport -- long trip upcoming. You can't beat this. The line was long when we got there, but they moved quickly. Prices are a little higher then what I'm used to spending at Bo's but it was a great meal and quick and easy.  Growing up in NC, this is what it is all about. I'm so glad they have one in the Charlotte Airport -- In Terminal C I believe."}
{"text":"The good: hmmm... It is close to 485, I have never gotten sick from the food. The bad: I have never had a pleasant experience here. The employees just seem glazed over jaded. I ordered a two breast dinner once around 3pm and was told there was no chicken. I asked why and was told that the \"chicken cooker\" was not there yet.... I swear.  I stay away for a while but even with new staff I just don't get good service. The bottom line: it is a place to eat in an area lacking such, but I would take the time to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I gave this Bojangles 1 star only because I had to.  This is the most poorly managed Bo's I've ever been to.  I went to the drive-thru lane yesterday for a medium Diet Pepsi.  I finally got to place my order 12 minutes later.  I gave my order and the girl read it back to me as a sweet tea.  Got that straightened out, and it was another 6 minutes to the window, then I sat at the window for another 8 minutes. Never, ever again!!!"}
{"text":"This one isn't keeping up with orders - wasn't able to order anything because they were out of chicken breasts (tried to sell me three wings and call it some kind of meal -_-) This is inside an airport and they should be able to keep up with be aware of the flow of food going out (aka...be making more when they see that it's running too low/there's none left.) Really annoying. Not enough time between my flights to wait on a fresh batch being made. Should have been on that already in an airport not have it be made to order."}
{"text":"I arrived to CLT at 5am from Denver and walked right past Bojangles (would never normally think to eat there). While sitting in the USAir club thinking how breakfast options are terrible at this airport, I jumped onto yelp. After reading reviews, I made the trek down at 7am on a Saturday. Pretty good line formed (about 9 deep) but I'd say it only took 4-5 minutes until I had ordered and received my order!    Biscuits were pretty decent. Sausage and gravy biscuit was also good at the time. Cajun chicken I tried too but didn't seem very breakfast like, but was of alright quality for a fast food airport joint.  After about an hour though, I sure felt like crud.  I never have stomach problems from food - but this one sure made me feel somewhat sick on my next two flights.  Will not return.  Not worth it, especially when flying and either way the food is NOT good for you at all."}
{"text":"The service at this location is inconsistent. I ordered 2 steak biscuits and a small coffee, but received a large coffee and one steak biscuits. When I spoke to the manager he refused to fix their mistake. Customer service is not their focus."}
{"text":"Popeyes eat your heart out! Some of the tastiest biscuits I've had in awhile. I noticed one of my Foursquare friends had regular check ins here, so I decided to save this place to my To-do list in the event that I'd be in town. Lone behold, I had a layover in Charlotte. I definitely permeated the entire plane with the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Somewhat recently opened location. Was surprised it hasn't already been put on here. Anyway, it's as good as any of them, but I'm giving 4/5 stars because they mess up my order almost every time I've gone . Maybe they are still working out the kinks of being a newly opened business. Something that needs to be mentioned is every single time I've gone through the drive-thru, for some reason they NEVER remember to give me a straw with my order. Usually they will hand you your drink without a straw because they stick a straw in the food box, but each time I've gone there they forget it, so save yourself some frustration and ask for straws at the window before you take off."}
{"text":"(2.5 stars)  I haven't had Bojangles since the early-mid 1990s when I was on vacation in the South.  Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.  Connecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA, I knew I was going to stop at Bojangles to give their chicken a try (this Bojangles is located in Concourse B of the US Airways terminal).  Bojangles may be fast food and a chain, but at least it is a regional chain and provides something different than other nearby airport eateries such as Burger King, Chili's, Quizno's, and KFC.  There is a sign posted that says the food gets out within minutes of ordering (to capitalize on those commuters who have to get-it-quick-and-go).  They delivered on their promise because the food came out really quick (less than a minute).  Service was also friendly and efficient.  They also seemed well-staffed to handle peak times.  It looked like many travelers were choosing Bojangles for their layover dining destination.  Their individual meals were not in the $5 range, but they were under $10 (which is not bad considering that airport food is often overpriced).  Family meals were also available.  I had three pieces of chicken (2 thighs and a leg) with one side (mashed potatoes and gravy) and a biscuit.  The chicken was quite crispy on the outside.  Often, fried chicken at fast food places can be overly fatty or skimpy on the meat, but there was a good portion of chicken meat on the thighs.  The dark meat had the appropriate amount of fat, but it was not too fatty.  The chicken was also juicy.  Unfortunately, the chicken was a little bit bland and I was expecting more kick.  Popeyes has a nice spiciness to their chicken, but Bojangles' chicken (on the other hand) could have used a little more heat and seasoning.  Honey and hot sauce were available, which helped give the chicken more flavor.  There was some greasiness to the chicken, but it was fried chicken after all (that is kind of a given).  The mashed potatoes were similar to the mashed potatoes you would find at KFC.  Same taste with that signature texture that can only be described as not real-mashed-potato-like.  The gravy at Bojangles had a little more flavor than KFC.  I'm fine with KFC mashed potatoes so I thought this side was okay.  The biscuit was large and had a nice, crunchy golden brown top.  Unfortunately, the biscuit was quite dry.  Airport food is often average quality, overpriced and the same everywhere.  I still can't figure out how there seem to be Cinnabons at most of the country's airports when they are so hard to find elsewhere.   Since Bojangles is a regional chain, I think it would definitely be worth trying if you are a fan of fried chicken and have some time to kill at the Charlotte Airport.  (Irrelevant Note) I sat next to NFL QB Jimmy Clausen on the airplane back to LA and I was surprised that there were not many people in Charlotte who recognized him--especially considering that he was the Carolina Panthers' top draft pick just a few weeks ago."}
{"text":"The same as most BJ's... Particularly cleaner than most (including the restrooms. Wash greeted w/a genuine greeting. Would like for the food to be a bit hotter, rather than Luke warm!"}
{"text":"Sloooowwwww service. Good is similar to other Bojangles. 3-4 rating. But seriously some days it takes 20-30 minutes to get thru a drive thru. What is going on?"}
{"text":"All I've ever had was KFC and Popeyes so since I had a layover in Charlotte I knew immediately what I wanted to try BOJANGLES!   Honestly I was quite impressed, I ordered the 4 piece chicken strips with fries, a biscuit and the legendary ice tea and it definitely hit the spot. The chicken is not overly greasy and it has a good flavor. The biscuit was hard, but maybe that's because it was the last thing I ate and it had gotten cold. The tea though - Oh man! That tea is yummy!   Just so you know, the line is long, but it goes rather quickly. The staff maybe seem rude to some, but honestly with the amount of traffic they get, they're really not going to have a 5 minute convo about what's the best item on the menu. It's CHICKEN people - Not a 4 star restaurant. Order your damn meal and keep it truck'n!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. I love BoJangles!  I live about a mile away, been going to this location for years and will not be going back.  I can tolerate a lot of things but the crew is out of control and disrespectful to the managers and customers. They were out of home style tenders and most side items. They did not get the order right and the food was not edible.  Not that anyone their cared in the least."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE.   I don't get off of work until 10 pm, and neither does my wife. We both wanted Bojangles and decided to go to the store on George Liles Parkway (I've been here before) at 10:15 pm after looking up the store hours (as you can see here on yelp they lose at 11 pm). Before I could even get into the building, a young lady screamed at me from the drive through saying, \"You can't come in here! We're closed! We close at 10\" EVERYTHING ON THE INTERNET AND THE HOURS ON THE STORE SAY 11 pm. To make matters worse, my wife and I watched them allow a single man into the building to order.   I will never eat here again. I've never felt so disrespected at a restaurant."}
{"text":"First time I've ever eaten at this place. I gave it a chance I'm never going there again. Requested a drink with no ice guess what I got ice. Got my food box with no utensils and one napkin. For one of driven another quarter-mile I would've found KFC."}
{"text":"Having Bojangles made my day! Since I'm not living in the South anymore I miss having my Bojangles but on my flight back home to my convenience there was one in the airport!   I ordered a 2 piece dinner with a side of dirty rice. The chicken was fried a little too long but was good none the less. The dirty rice put an extra smile on my face. The biscuit wasn't flaky like I liked but I was just excited to have Bojangles.  Bojangles is a Southern staple and if you haven't been you should definitely give them a try when you're in the South!"}
{"text":"I just went to this BoJangles and it's customer service is horrible. Once again, they asked me to please wait 4 minutes for my chicken tenders to cook. Ok, no problem there. Pull up beside the curb as asked. 4 minutes passes, nothing. 6 minutes, nothing, 10 minutes nothing. At 12 minutes I finally decided to walk in. Guess what, she was waiting for someone to pour my half gallon of ice tea. I get it's a thankless job to work fast food so I don't begrudge them that. Management sucks and needs to do a better job in insuring adequate customer service. What makes it even worse is 4 people standing around laughing and hamming it up while waiting on 1 person to pour tea. This place is a joke. Don't go!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was hard but biscuits and tea are the best in the world."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Bojangles in San Diego but instead we have Popeye's which is alright but not Bojangles. I was so happy to see a Bojangles as soon as I got off the plan. I wanted to get a 2 or 3 piece but like all the other restaurants in the airport it was crazy expensive. So I decided to just get a chicken biscuit with sweet tea,extra hot sauce and  honey. There was a dining area close by which was jammed packed. Also the spot was crazy busy so know what you want and be patient. Hopefully I can go back to North Carolina just for Bojangles."}
{"text":"The food at this location is always hot and the service is friendly.  They always get the order right down to adding lemon to my tea.  It's nice to get great service at a fast food chain.  Good fast food."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles and my husband actually wanted to go, so we made a pit stop before car shopping.   It's kind of difficult to see the sign because it's right behind the Wendy's sign, so just be aware that it's there.   The only thing I can complain about is the wait time. It was a little slow. But when we were up to the window we saw a guy walking out with 4 of those Big Bo Boxes. Crazy! I think they had to remake all of their food and that's why it was slow.   It almost worked in our advantage though, because everything was so fresh! It was great! I only got a plain biscuit, but my husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese and it was so good we almost went back to get another!"}
{"text":"OM to the Mofo G! This Place Is In the Airport, And Boy I Tell You What...The Buttery Flaky Biscuit  And The Crispy Seasoned Chicken Fillet is Freakin' Awesome!!! I'd Say Skip The Fries If You Cant Get Them Hot From The Fryer. But Please Do Have The Sweet Tea, Its Great! I Cant Wait To Fly through Charlotte Again! MMMMM... Chicken Biscuits!!!"}
{"text":"I have given up on this location.  One too many times they have been out of the chicken I wanted to order.  The last time was at the drive thru and they didn't tell me when I placed my order,  but waited until I pulled up to the window to tell me they were out of Supremes and asked I wanted to substitute wings instead. Really bad food prep management at this location."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location since it was rebuilt and I LOVE IT! It's so clean and modern looking compared to any Bojangles I've ever seen before. The staff is super polite and helpful. They bring your food to you along with any condiments you need and continue to walk the dining room to make sure everyone is taken care of. I compare all other locations to the one now. It is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, how come we don't have one of these in Houston?  They might could give Chick-Fil-A a run for their money, lol.  Take in mind this review is based solely on my breakfast purchase of the tastiest chicken biscuit I have had to date.  The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.  The biscuit was soft, fluffy and also had a great buttery flavor as well.  Hand in hand the cajun chicken paired perfectly with the biscuit, which I might add was hearty in size as well.    I would SO opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spicy chicken biscuit from Chick-Fil-A because sometimes theirs is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level.  Whenever I get back to these parts, I am going to look for a Bojangles and tear up another biscuit, lol.  The fried chicken looks fantastic so I know I want to try that also.  Lucky all of you that have one of these nearby; can you airmail me one, lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Ohio and have never had Bojangles before.  The Cajun filet biscuit was awesome and the sweet tea here is very good.  Hubby enjoyed the steak biscuit but they forgot our fries and we did have to wait a while.  The food we got was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Bojangles reminds me so much of my childhood and the South. I lived in Charlotte for about 7 years as a kid and looovveed Bojangles! It's the best fast food joint besides In and Out, however, I think that if there was a Bojangles in Cali, I'd be alllllllllll over it. What I remember the most about it are the fries. They had a delicious seasoning on it as well as their chicken. I love spicy, cajun style southern cooking and this hits the spot.   I'm not sure if this the location we used to go to, but I had to review one in Charlotte. I miss Bojangles!"}
{"text":"Well, it's over priced, after all you're at the airport. But it was very good.  Loved the tenders and biscuits. I will come back again on my way through Charlotte."}
{"text":"This Bojangles is the WORST!!! I have never gone through the drive thru and not had to wait at least 15 - 20min. The employees are SO slow and could careless about their job! This Bojangles is pathetic!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I came in late, or because it's the South, but service here seems a bit slow.  The sweet tea dispenser was empty when I came in too, but they filled up my cup when I asked.   The chicken is excellent though. I don't like how they guard the ketchup behind the counter, but they will give it to you if you ask.  When I flew out of CLT, everything was in good shape.  Tea tanks were full, so I was able to drink my 4th or 5th cup of diabetes(sweet tea) - take that bloomberg - without feeling like I was being judged."}
{"text":"Employees at this Bojangles are always sullen & rude. My order was usually wrong and the last time I went I got no receipt. I drive a few miloes out of the way to go to a different Bojangles now just so I can avoid all of that."}
{"text":"Like Brian, I love me some Bojangles... especially on days after over-indulging in adult beverages.  On my visits to this particular Bojangles, I have found some inconsistency in the quality of food... and they are soooo slow!   On my visit this past weekend, my food was fine - it was hot and fresh. However, The drive-thru took FOREVER and there was only one car in front of me!! I thought that person might be getting a huge order which would account for how slow they were...but nope - when they handed the food & drinks out to that car, it looked like an order for 2 people.  Overall, this location needs to do a better job managing quality control and improving customer service."}
{"text":"The Bojangles at Indian Land is located in a small shopping center at the intersection of US 521 and SC 160; the entrance his somewhat blocked by trees, so be careful when turning in or out of here.  The store itself is usually clean, including the drink station and restrooms; staff friendly and helpful.  On my most recent visit (after 1pm), I ordered the homestyle tenders (had coupon), and the $5 2-piece combo deal (yes, lot of food here).  The homestyle tenders were pretty good, ate with the BBQ.  The biscuits were fresh and buttery.  The fries (came in the combo) were soggy and unpleasant.  The chicken was not tasty; the breading was barely on them and looked and tasted like they have been waiting all morning.  My last few trips to this location I have experienced similar with the chicken.  Overall, I give it 2 out of 5 stars, comparing it with other Bojangles and to the other choices available in the area.  If it wasn't for the consistent poor quality of the chicken, this location would easily be 4 of 5 because of everything else."}
{"text":"First, let me say I love Bojangles. With that out of the way, if you can possibly find another location (easy in Charlotte), go there. The first time I used the drive through, I ordered and paid with no issue. Several minutes of waiting later the girl opens the window and says \"We're out of chicken.\" I actually had to ask her for a refund. Figured maybe it was a fluke and went again several weeks later. Inside this time, extremely rude staff, too busy talking to one another to take my order. Finally ordered and they managed to give me the exact opposite of what I asked for. Seriously. Just don't."}
{"text":"4 years of horrible service and horrible attitudes. It doesn't matter if it's breakfast time and you're waiting in he drive thru or if it's dinner time, expect to be here for at least 30 minutes. Make sure you get them to repeat your order back to you before you pay and always ask for a receipt. Better yet, keep driving to the next bojangles, you'll have better luck and service."}
{"text":"HEY YOU ON YOUR STOPOVER - GO HERE!  That should be enough right? No? Well then read on...  You cannot get better fast food fried chicken. If I lived in Charlotte, I would probably find a way to get into the airport just to go to this location.  More?  I had two stopovers here and both times were excellent at opposite times of day. I have a theory that this location has consistently fresh turnover of food because it is right next to the terminal. People keep coming off their flight hungry, so they gotta keep making fresh food to fill the demand. That's where you come in.  Don't you have a flight to catch?  If you're still reading, here's what I get every time and why. Two piece dinner, dark meat, The chicken is golden brown, and has a crispy, perfect flavor, perfect crispness, and big juicy pieces. Everything about it is just exactly the way I like it. Mashed potatoes are obviously constituted and come with this rich, tasty gravy. For fast food mashed, it is tops.   But by far, the best part of the meal is the huge flaky biscuit, not too buttery, crisp and firm on outside. It must be made (somewhat) from scratch because it's too good.  Service is good, but there is no free water and airport drinks are expensive. You can add a fountain drink for a dollar or so or wait til your flight. Which by the way, shouldn't you be getting on to right now?"}
{"text":"Only 1 star because can't give fewer. Biscuits were stale & hard. Foul odor around the condiment station. Severely disappointed when compared to the quality of food and service at store in VA eastern shore area."}
{"text":"I'm a Church's fan first and Popeye's second. Bojangles is a cross between the two with way better biscuits. The only thing that would make these biscuits better is if you could some how cross breed it with a biscuit from Red Lobster. The chicken I got was luke warm and way average. Like the dirty rice just wish it was hotter as far as temperature. If everything was piping hot it'd probably be way better. The girl at the drive thru window was very nice, but the location needs to be cleaned up or renovated. I wouldn't mind seeing one of these pop up in Sacramento California. Liked the fact you get Pete's hot sauce with the chicken too."}
{"text":"Simply OK. Staff said their thank yous but didn't seem to care at all. Place seemed pretty clean. Fries great. Chicken tenders a bit old. Biscuit great. One thing that got me was a cleaning bucket someone left on the handoff part of the counter where food was coming across. Been in food a long time. I know that's not ok. Overall just ok."}
{"text":"The Northeast has Popeye's. The South has Bojangles.  My first experience with Bojangles was freshman year of college when I ventured to South Carolina for a spring break service trip. The chicken was perfect: crispy, juicy, moist, not too salty, and fast! Grab a sweet tea and you're good to go.  Of course when I saw the Bojangles in the airport, I knew exactly what my next meal would be. Within seconds of ordering (literally), I had my box in hand, ready to hop on my connecting flight. Once on board, I feasted like none other and it was exactly how I remembered. Nothing could take me away from my moments of ecstasy. Not the crying baby three rows back. Not the grouchy grandmother to my left that didn't her ginger ale. Not the extreme turbulence as we ascended into the sky.  If you're having a bad travel day (or even a good one), indulge and treat yourself to a chicken dinner that'll make your journey that much better."}
{"text":"I been wanting to try is for a long time and the wait was totally worth it. Delicious juicy fried chicken and the biscuits were soft, fresh and buttery. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"New Location in Indian Land; Went on a Sunday night at 6:45pm. Chicken looked less than fresh and they insisted that I had to select from what they available first. Then, they didn't have the enough of one type (legs or wings) of the unfresh chicken to fill a complete eight piece order, so I could take my pick of the unfresh chicken. Then there were no Pintos or Biscuits ready. Spoke to  the assistant unit manager who appeared to be offended that I didn't understand that they might run out of items. They are a chicken and buscuit business, no?   Went to the Bojangles further up the road in Fort Mill, where I got everything hot and fresh just like I needed. Go to Fort Mill location."}
{"text":"Forget KFC! Forget Popeyes! Forget Churchs! Bojangles is where its at! Located on Concourse B at the CLT Airport... Ordered chicken n biscuit on my layover!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm recommending a fast food place (considering how extremely unhealthy it is) but I'm beginning to understand the Bojangles culture that I've grown up around as an NC native.  They are truly \"famous\" for their chicken and biscuits.  Every now and then I'll go there for a treat, but nothing on a regular basis (think heart attack by age 35).  However, their biscuits and chicken are just fantastic southern comfort food.  Much better than KFC and though lacking in atmosphere, better than Price's Chicken Coop as well."}
{"text":"I don't know how many variations I had to ask for before I was able to order. Out of everything! Server seemed very whatever about it. Was very disappointed in the whole experience."}
{"text":"There is no better place for a quick breakfast than Bojangles, I love there ham, egg and cheese biscuits and chicken biscuits."}
{"text":"Extremely slow for a Monday morning at 8 AM.  Odd they couldn't give me my total at the drive-thru speaker. I was greeted by a friendly employee.  Potato rounds were hot, but extra salty. I ordered sweet tea, but was given a Pepsi. I didn't realize it until after I pulled out of the parking lot. My steak biscuit was overcooked - the biscuit & the steak.   Easy in & out onto Bruton Smith. Ample parking."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect of this place, but man I'm glad we tried it! We were disappointed we couldn't find a Chick Fil A to try but I think this was just as good an option. We got the supreme (spicy) chicken tender combo with the seasoned fries, and also a biscuit and sweet tea! The fries were soooo good. They were nice and hot when we got them too! I was slightly disappointed in the biscuit cuz it wasn't as buttery as I expected... But oh well lol. The chicken tenders were good, but not as spicy as I was wanting - the amount of crunch and moisture they had made up for it though. The employees at this locations were extremely nice, which is rare in an airport. I'm sad we don't have this place in Washington."}
{"text":"The worst bojangles ever. Literally ever. It takes forever to get your food, the food always tastes stale, and everyone is rude."}
{"text":"The biscuit was fine. The hash browns were greasy and inedible,, very bad. The biggest downside was the unbelievably slow service at the drive through window. We got there early, there were 2 cars in front of us. It took at least 15 minutes to get our order."}
{"text":"This location is always hit & miss with me. Food is always consistent; however, the service isn't. Whenever I see a line at the drive-thru, I keep driving by, especially if I'm in a hurry.  I've had several menu items, including the steak biscuit combo with fries/bo'rounds, sausage biscuit combo & chicken supremes meal.  Employees are friendly. Parking is a bit limited."}
{"text":"Burnt/overcooked steak & biscuit & hash browns make me sad, especially when it's from my favorite fast food restaurant. Unfortunately, I ran into this today at this location.   The employee who took my order was very friendly, but the girl who gave me my food acted like she wanted to be elsewhere.  Had I not already been on the other side of George Lyles Parkway before I began eating, I probably would have taken the food back.  Easy in & out off George Lyles Parkway & plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Service was quick and fast, despite a long line in the morning. I've only had the breakfast cajun filet biscuit sandwich here and it was pretty decent, but nothing compared to Chik Fil A. The chicken is juicy and the biscuit is very well made. But I think the overall quality is not as great as a Chik Fil A biscuit sandwich."}
{"text":"I thought I knew how a great fried chicken tastes like. This place changed that and I got to try the best fried chicken so far while my trip to the south. Wish they have this chain here in the midwest area. Out of two flavors, Cajun or Southern, I like Southern better. While you there, don't forget to order their fries - thinly cut with that spice on them, makes them stand out from the rest. I've even went there just for their fries."}
{"text":"I always visit Bojangles when I visit the south middle of the day no white meat?? And then you ask if I want something else??? Like what are you going to substitute a breast with??? So we waited about 15 minutes, get home and still didn't have everything we ordered. ARGH... this experience will make Bojangles an afterthought on my next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, always get orders wrong, staff was arguing with each other, trash all over floor, trash cans overflowing -- order was all wrong.  Will never go back.  Dont ever go on Saturday morning - you will wait forever"}
{"text":"Since it's renovation, this establishment is truly spectacular. The cleanliness, the friendly staff and the delicious food coupled with the new interior design makes for a truly phenomenal experience. Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is........I waited 30 minutes for a 12 piece box with biscuits and 20 more minutes after I got the 12 piece for some dirty rice and fries........they didn't even offer me a free apple pie for the wait."}
{"text":"It was good, because i love chicken. Its a good way to K.O before your flight. I didnt find anything special about this place but the food was good. I would come here again."}
{"text":"the worse bojangles I have ever ordered from the biscuits were nasty greasey, eggs burnt avoid this place like the plague as they cannot cook eggs without burning them."}
{"text":"Tip:  The drive-thru is consistently faster than dine-in service.  Must be all the commuters on Independence Blvd.  I go for the best biscuits and Columbian coffee, not like McDonald's premium burnt coffee."}
{"text":"This Bo's is a regular lunch spot for me. The service is usually fast and friendly, and I always get what I ordered. My menu choices of the supremes combo or the supremes salad combo are always delicious."}
{"text":"The worst Bo's I have ever been to. It was slow and they didn't make my supremes salad correctly. Also, the drinks are all behind the counter, so you have to ask for a tea refill."}
{"text":"That Cajun Chicken Biscuit was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten...and I've eaten pure salt."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! It's filthy I just walked out after I reluctantly used the restroom, which looked like it hadn't been touched in a while! It didn't even smell clean! I can't eat in a place that doesn't clean there restrooms! I understand it's fast food but damn you can mop, dust, or at the very least pick up shit on the floor!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, recently remodeled and the staff is surprisingly friendly for a fast food joint.  I guess it's that Mint Hill charm.  Predictably awesome buttermilk biscuits and good coffee and the line moves fast even on Saturday and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service what else could you ask for? Better chicken? No, they serve a reasonably size bird, ulike KFC, with a marinade that gives it it's signature spicy flavor.  This location is a bit overpriced it being in an airport and they charge for refills drinks."}
{"text":"Never have a bad experience here.  The drive-thru staff is always very friendly.   Unfortunately this morning a(n apparent) manager was berating the staff because my order wasn't ready when I pulled up.  1.  This could be handled away from customers.  2.  That's no way to teach anyone anything. It made me feel very uncomfortable and I felt bad for the employees."}
{"text":"Went to Bojangles today and it was PACKED. I'm not sure if it's Panther-mania, a hunger for delicious fried chicken, or just poor timing, but it seemed like everyone and their brother, uncle, and auntie were there getting lunch.   I love me some Bojangles and had to go with the Chicken supremes, bo-sauce and dirty rice. Don't forget their LEGENDARY un-sweet iced tea. Being a Yankee, I've got to get that un-sweet iced tea, sorry Southerners, I can't hang.  Anyway - delicious as always, even if the wait was extra long.  Thanks Bojangles."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon - Aug 21st....  I ordered the 4 Piece Supremes Combo with seasoned fries as my side and a sweet tea to drink.  I went through the drive-thru and found the service to be more than satisfactory,  My order totaled to $6.16 and was provided to me exactly to my specifications.   Disappointments:  None really.  If anything, the fries were a bit cold and sub-par as a whole.   This specific location is no different than your standard Bojangles' location.  The only other thing to note is often times they run out of chicken, especially wings late on most evenings.  Otherwise, this place will suite most Bojangles' fans."}
{"text":"Ok, I was hungry, really hungry so I decided it was a Bojangles night. So I drove the 1 1/2 mile trip to my neighborhood bojangles and used the drive thru and ordered a tailgate special. I arrived about 8:20pm. Got my order and drove straight back home to watch the basketball finals. Made our plates. Sat down to eat only to discover the dirty rice was Luke warm and the chicken was literally room temperature. Now to be clear, the last time I ordered chicken at this location the chicken was not hot that time either but it was a little warm. Today's chicken wasn't even a little warm, it was \"literally\" room temperature! Isn't it against the law to sell cooked food below a certain temperature?! I thought the last time I went there they were just having a bad day so I basically gave them a pass. After this recent trip it's starting to seem to me that the employees just don't take quality serious or don't really care about making sure the customers get what they are supposed to get. A hot meal. Fried chicken should ALWAYS be served hot. Cold fried chicken just will not do! I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Went to pick up dinner tonight for the family for a quick meal and had awful customer service. First they misheard the order and then were rude when I clarified my order at the window. It was clear when the drive thru employee turned away she was complaining about me to her coworker...while the drive through door was still open! Although the manager apologized for the mix up, I don't think I will likely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is the absolute slowest restaurant in Charlotte, NC. I'm only writing more about the terrible service because Yelp doesn't deem My too short of a comment as a review."}
{"text":"I have held off a long time because I don't enjoy giving negative reviews. While I like the food at Bojangles restaurants, this location is horrible. If you are a fast food chain you must be able to manage a drive-thru line without the customers waiting half an hour. That is not fast food!  This is a regularly occurring issue and it doesn't matter what day of the week or what time of day, this drive-thru is never fast food.  Most of the time they only have one window operating, so I suspect you are not staffing yourself appropriately. I am currently sitting in the line and have been for 23 minutes. I still have three cars in front of me to reach the second window, and the first window is unstaffed. It is time for management to get it together and stop making people wait, or customers will stop returning.  Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Food was good but again had to wait for our order for like 40 minutes at a fast food joint wtf"}
{"text":"The main reason I wanted to post my dissatisfaction was in hopes that management may read their reviews and one day make improvements. This Bojangles has consistently slow service, actually no service what so ever.  I have waited on my food on several occasions with no explanation from the server or the manager.  The manager, it is obvious, has never learned how to manage employees.  I have watched him work side by side with them and never offer advise or help.  While people wait at the register to place an order there is no explanation from anyone why you are waiting.  There are apologies after you wait, but nothing said until then.  A couple behind me said \"it's always like this\".  That is sad that we have gotten used to poor service and do not ask for any better."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I ever had in Bojangles. I felt like I was a burden because I ordered the tailgate special. After I paid she said you have to wait 14 minutes. The employees are not friendly at all."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at this Bojangles recently.  I had an issue occur during a prior visit and I was contacted personally by the store manager Monte, the Regional Manager and Corp.  While it was a small issue, they all delve in and ensured that I was totally satisfied and that they were keeping a loyal customer.  What exemplary customer service!  Hats off to this franchise and this store!"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken. This place has some of the best I have ever had. Delicious breading and good biscuits. Yum!"}
{"text":"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!! Just sat in the drive through for 20 mins! I would have left but I was trapped in the line by other cars. Then got by chicken biscuit and it was literally a burnt to a crisp chicken tender on a biscuit. Not edible. Will never go here again! Horrible."}
{"text":"I am giving this Bojangles 2 stars because I went there, ordered my food then had to wait in the drive thru line for 7 minutes. There were two cars in front of me, they hadn't even moved the whole time i was in line so I had to leave.  It seemed like it was protocol for the employees to tell the person at the window to pull up or pull around if there food isn't ready -- in order to prevent others from waiting, so they can get their food and go. That didn't happen here. Pretty ridiculous.   I hope the next time I visit this Bojangles, they're a lot better than this visit."}
{"text":"I have no issues with the food. It's the consistently bad service, dirty tables, drug deals in the bathroom, and homeless people in this newly renovated restaurant that bother me. I've had it and I'll drive further away to go to a better Bojangles."}
{"text":"By far the worst Bojangles I've ever been to..... The owners should shut this location down or take two weeks, rehire a whole new staff, and start from scratch. After waiting 7 minutes before unplaced my border, I had to tell the manager how to fix my order(with the ticket in front of his face)...Driest chicken I've ever had. Potatoes had no gravy. Had to ask for extra sauces and biscuit that I paid for....piss poor. Great job management! Never again."}
{"text":"They are always slow. I have never gotten my order right. Ask for white meat and get legs. Asked for sausage egg biscuit got bacon egg and cheese. Never have sweet potato pies. I live near so I can go back but I've gotten in the habit of pulling over and checking my bag. It's terrible. Like who is the expo. Where's the manager. Once they closed at 8 pm and said they were short staffed. What?! They could have ran the drive thru."}
{"text":"I've been living near this Bojangles for almost ten years and am still not a fan of theirs. My last visit to this Bojangles, my biscuit was hard and cold and my bo'rounds were stale and disgusting. They tasted as if they had been reheated from day prior to me getting them. I have never had any food from Bojangles that tasted that way, and even if it were just that one day, I will not return to this Bojangles. Thankfully they are building a new one on Statesville Ave right off exit 23, so hopefully they are better."}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because my experiences prior to today were decent. This morning at 7:20am I went to get a medium order of bo rounds. Something I stop at Bojangles for daily. So I know they are $1.83. Why was I charge $1.99 today? This girl at the register rang me up for a medium seasoned fries. While only a 16 cents difference, no one wants to pay extra for something. They want to pay the correct price for it. I would have gone in and complained but who has time to do that when they are on their way into work."}
{"text":"This bojangles is hit or miss. The past two times I have gone, my tea was awful.   1st time, I ordered a large tea, it tasted like water. I had to come back through the drive thru to get another.  2nd time (last Wednesday), I ordered a half gallon of sweet tea. It was extremely light. Something told me to taste it before I left the restaurant. I did, and it tasted like water as well. I'm not even sure why they would bottle that weak tea into the half gallon containers. Pretty ridiculous.  If this Bojangles could be more consistent, I could rate them higher but they are very inconsistent and something is often wrong with what I order. Customer service is decent; associates are always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried to give this location another chance after writing a review just one day before updating a previous review. Got to the area where you order, and of course... no bo'berry biscuits were ready. It's a shame. I've always had great customer service when I have visited this location but Saturday after Saturday, two of the main breakfast items are never available when I get there. It's so frustrating. I guess I will stop coming here after all..."}
{"text":"Slow. Slow slow S L O W!!! It was 7 customers TOTAL...4 were seated eating...10 minutes passed & they still hasn't taken my order or the man in front of me.   Pathetic!!!"}
{"text":"I will not be eating here again. The service is THE WORST and the food is NEVER fresh or even warm. I moved to the Steele Creek area almost a year ago, and this was my third time attempting to get food from this particular location due to the convenience of it. Last night I ordered a kids meal with chicken supremes, mac n cheese and a cheerwine. I paid the lady at the window, she didn't speak to me other than telling me my total. She hands me my food and closes the window...no \"thank you\", \"have a good evening\", nothing. So I get down to the red light, open my box, and low and behold there are fires in there, not mac and cheese. I did a U turn and drove back around to the window (there was no-one else there) at 18:30 at night, I politely tell the lady I ordered mac and cheese and not fries and hand her the food and my receipt (which said mac and cheese). She once again, says nothing, snatches the box and receipt out of my hand, and goes and talks to another girl. They come back to the window, give me my box back and hand me a small bag with the macaroni in it, and slam the window. Not once did I get a \"thank you, \"I'm sorry\", \"we apologize\"...NOTHING! The food was so old and cold I threw it away once I got home. I will NOT go back here. I will go to the Mcdonalds, Zaxbys, or Wendys across the street."}
{"text":"Ran into this joint at the Charlotte intl. airport....The line to get this would not shrink.. I will make sure my next connecting flight is into Charlotte just to get me some of this goodness! lol  They need to work on the biscuit, more butter!  Must try..  4 stars only cause I love my Popeyes,"}
{"text":"Order what you please, this is a hodgepodge of preservatives, sodium, fat, cholesterol and anything else unhealthy for you. It's delicious but after a few trips you'll need to hit the planet fitness down the street."}
{"text":"I am LIVID with this Bojangles this morning. Usually I have NO problems with them. Never! But today they really messed up. They asked if I wanted to wait 4 1/2 minutes for Bo rounds which is all I ever order and I say ok. It's 7:11am. I pull up past the door to wait for the bo rounds. 4 minutes go by... No food. 6 minutes no food. At 7:23am I was finally FED UP and walk inside to get my food. Get the bo rounds AND THEY ARENT EVEN HOT. I'm PISSED. They aren't even FRESH. I sat and waited for 12 minutes for COLD FOOD. I won't be back FOR A WHILE!!!!"}
{"text":"February 2018   I'm not usually a regular customer at Bojangles and today won't alter my choice. I just ordered two fish sandwiches. There were two cars ahead of me in the drive thru. It seemed to be taking a long time to get the orders . When I pulled up it was apparent the woman at the window wasn't worried about taking the orders . As she fumbled my order and asked me to repeat it about 3 times .   By the time that I was at the window to pay 10 minutes had passed. There were now 5 cars behind me. I didn't get a hello or welcome at the speaker and didn't get it at the window either. Just \"$6.28\".    As I waited another 5 minutes watching two workers dancing and laughing... I never got a \"sorry for the wait\" or \"our register is down\" or the \"fryer is down\".  Add another 4 minutes and the window opens and I get my 2 fish sandwiches.. again no greeting/or words from the dancing/laughing worker.  So 19 minutes for my order ..  Yeh, it's just one time BUT no thanks....never again at this location."}
{"text":"First this location does GREAT getting loads of people thru the line quickly. Due to the volume EVERYTHING is always hit and fresh.   But, it is macro produced fried chicken. With that said it is pretty darned good macro produced fried chicken. What is missing, to me, is a really tasty spicy option.   The biscuits are serious indulgence."}
{"text":"One of the worst Bojangles I've ever visited. Called in an order of 24 biscuits. Gave an hour prep time, (person that answered phone said that was plenty of time). When I arrived, was told by the Assistant Unit Director, (Donna) that she \"gave the order to the kitchen as soon as she got it, (she was the person that took the order) but they haven't started yet\". She gave ZERO F's that they had an hour to make the food but hadn't started it. She offered no apologies, nothing. I had no real choice but to wait on the order. This gave me an opportunity to watch Donna interact with other customers. Horrible! She was short and borderline rude to almost every customer she spoke to. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I come here at least once a week and get the same thing. Recently I've not gotten one receipt. So I have to trust that the girl at the window is entering the right amount and that she won't mess it up because I'll have no proof. It seems like every morning they have to run my card through the machine at least twice. This morning we were getting our drinks and the card machine failed again. So instead of my husband and I getting our drinks his got left because of the machine not working. A restaurant I used to love to come to now not so much."}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning recently, my parents and I were heading to Conway, SC for a funeral from their house in Charlotte. We hit the drive thru on our way out for their breakfast and some bo-berry biscuits. They forgot a sandwich, but quickly rectified the situation when I went in. The bo-berry biscuits were an odd shape, more of a crescent when I remember them as a round shape before, but it has been several years since I have been to a Bojangles', so my memory must be off. The breakfast sandwiches were fresh and hot, the coffee was hot and good. The service was pretty darn good.  Bojangles is a fast food chain that I have only ever had in the Carolinas. Founded in the 1970's and based out of Charlotte, this was my favorite fast food place to eat at when I lived in Charlotte. Bojangles has this steak biscuit that I would crave so bad it hurt. I am glad to say with this visit, I am finally over it, but I just had to have one more sweet good bye.  If you are in the area, stop in and get some of their awesome and crispy chicken. It is SO much better than KFC or Popeye's (though I might lose my residency in Louisiana for saying that)."}
{"text":"Was told they needed a moment, then waited at least 5 minutes for someone to say anything, until I finally decided to just try to order. Then waited probably another 15-20 minutes in line. And they forgot my sauce that I asked for while ordering and again at the window. Nothing fast about this place."}
{"text":"This may have been one of the worst experiences I've had at a chicken fast food restaurant. We decided to stop at Bojangles for lunch since we're visiting charlotte and we do not live in the south. I initially went in excited because I had Bojangles a while ago and it did not disappoint. However, this one was bad. We placed our order for dine in and for a minute it took a while for anyone to make it. There was barely anybody else inside and in the drive through. When we got our food it was prepared in to go boxes even though we stated that we were eating there. Then lo and behold, there was a black semi long hair in one of the boxes. The chicken that I ordered was a leg and thigh. They were overly greasy and the mac&cheese was mediocre at best. The wings that the person with me seemed to look ok. The only positive things about this experience was that the bo berry biscuits were pretty good and the assistant manager working was respectful and gave us a free drink for the trouble. The rest of the employees did not seem to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"The biscuits are to die for.  Seriously.  The bo berry biscuits are good if you want something sweet (and I mean sweet), but you can't beat just a plain, melt in your mouth biscuit.    Service is good, too.  Can't remember a time when anyone's gotten my order wrong.  You can count on them to get it right."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for chicken... everytime i stop in charlotte my first stop is at bojangles...."}
{"text":"Once again I ordered several breakfast sandwiches at the drive through. And once again I get home and the biscuits are way undercooked, I actually rolled one into a dough ball.  I quit going here months ago for the same reason, and will now return to my my second choice for breakfast (McDonald's). Please discuss this with your kitchen staff, you can't advertise the best biscuits and then consistently serve undercooked products."}
{"text":"The usual short question with the short answer customer service. I swear they really hate they job. Why do I try! And this is the drive thru. Can you imagine if you dealt with them face to face.. omg.. i ordered the Bacon, eggs and cheese biscuit.. very quick.. and very few words. Guess it works out for the best. The biscuit was great. They made a fan out of me but I wish I can dodge the service any chance i can get!"}
{"text":"The worst bojangles I've ever been to! Horrible service and the employees are rude and just simply don't care."}
{"text":"The wait is so, so long. The food is fine. It taste like anything you would buy at a Bojangles location. But the wait! Most of the time I don't think its worth going through the line bc you're stuck for like 10 minutes at drive thru."}
{"text":"The staff here was super friendly!  We were picking up the big Bo Box before our Charlotte 49ers tailgate. We even called a head since it was such a big order.  It was cool they were able to start working on it for us.   When we were waiting, one of the workers (assumed it was a manager) talked to us and asked about the game that day.  As we were leaving, she wished us good luck and even said Go NINERS! Thought that was pretty awesome.    You never get that at fast food joints."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles but this location's drive thru always takes a long time. I've waited 20-25 minutes in line but people do tend to put up with it because it is Bojangles after all. But the wait should be addressed. Staff is cold by the time you get to the window.  No mention or apology for wait time and last time they told me my straw was in the box after I told her it wasn't. A little rude. Seasoning on fries is usually weak. Chicken has always been up to Bojangles standard of greatness."}
{"text":"I like many other reviewers love bojangles food however this particular location never fails to disappoint. I had to wait 15 min in the drive thru for a supreme combo. Every time I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and give them another try but they let me down every time. The frys and never good they are always undercooked and usually barely seasoned if seasoned at all. I am done with second  chances for this location and will not be returning. I recommend for all those craving some bojangles to take the time and little bit of extra distance and drive to the one down 521 right across the border. Maybe a little far but at least you will have good food."}
{"text":"We stopped at a Bojangles off Rte 95 in South Carolina on the way back from the Orange Bowl. Just as yummy as the other times. Boy, I wish they would expand up North even though it would make keeping my weight down even more difficult."}
{"text":"Sometimes being out on an empty tummy leads me to making really desperate decisions. I was starving and passed this Bojangles and thought, \"Hmm, never tried one before and I hear that is one of the staple eateries here in Charlotte.\" So I went through the drive-thru hoping for the best since I've heard pretty good things about the chain...and left looking through the bag and being disappointed.  I haven't been to what I consider fast food place in a really long time, so I was hoping for a welcome-back experience. Well, my order was missing the veggie combo, but they quickly corrected that. The veggie combo consists of 3 or 4 2oz containers of your choice of their sides (e.g., mac 'n cheese, cole slaw). BLAH. I was really craving chicken fingers so I ordered some of those as well. BLAH. They were dried out from maybe too much frying.   They are in a good location across from SouthPark Mall. The drive-thru is a bit hidden in the back, but is easy to get to.   In the future, when I am desperate again and craving fast food chicken fingers, I need to find a Dairy Queen. Bojangles, unfortunately, you don't make the cut."}
{"text":"Waited no less than 10 minutes in the drive-thru for a simple combo.  Zero courtesy from the young lady working the window."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a manager that has zero customer service then you found your establishment. This was my second visit to this restaurant and two separate times.  The manager, Steven, is horrible and truly needs to be dismissed. I have had the pleasure in being greeted by his unprofessional-ism twice and was not pleasant. You have to get rid of this guy or you will loose business because of poor management!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever and we have a Bojangles close to our home with great service.  I was shocked at the unprofessional manner of the cashiers.  There were no white meat chicken prepared, the buffet was filthy and the fries were cold.  I had to tell the cashier I was in rush as she was just standing around not preparing my order.  Her response, I'm waiting on biscuits.  I had to tell her give me what you have, I'm a little late.  It was terrible, terrible service.  The only saving grace was the manager (who I believe was latino).  The cashier didn't pack sauce or anything requested, so the manager was gracious enough to have me come back and pick it up and was apologetic.  This was the worse Bojangles I have ever visited and that is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"The drive-through is always backed up and moves slower than a snail. Last time there were 2 cars already ordered, I waited 9 minutes to place my order and in line over 120 minutes.  RIDICULOUS!  TODAY, I waited behind 2 cars to order, 3 waiting for their order 5 minutes, no movement - I left! Also the order speaker volume is so low, you can't hear or understand them.  Unfortunately there's not another nearby location.  This place is and has always been popular ... STEP IT UP FOLKS!"}
{"text":"It feels like sloths work here because it takes over 30 min to get through the drive thru. Beware: Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Didn't get my order right. I only ordered two sausage & eggs biscuits. And it took 10 mins waiting when only 2 cars were ahead..... Hence why i don't eat at Bojangles apparently. I bet McDonald's next door would've gotten it right & I could've seen it on the screen."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Cajun filets I've ever received. The manager at this location needs to be fired immediately."}
{"text":"Bojangles' You have lost another customer today. The Cajun Filet Biscuit you once prided yourself on used to be served with a plump, fried chicken breast. Please explain WTF is sitting on this biscuit here. You've clearly started cutting corners to save a buck and it shows with this excuse of a chicken patty."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte a few years ago, it was the giggle-inducing name that drew me in: Bojangles--- its just kinda funny in the cute sense :)    Anyway, on my maiden voyage to Bojangles, I wanted to keep it simple so I can sample the smaller items.  One bite of the fluffy pillow from heaven--also known as buttermilk biscuit, and I nearly went into nirvana!  It was so simple, yet made my taste buds forget Im in public.  I knew I was in love.  I also had the small order of Bo rounds, and because Im a sucker for hash browns, I fell in love all over again.  I greedily ordered another one, just before my last bite ended.  They season it with some sort of fairy dust and it makes all the difference. Im also in love with their egg and cheese biscuit.  So greasy and so yummy.   Its days like this that I wish I had my own personal bojangles in my basement, and my food order would come through those bank suction thing-ies :D"}
{"text":"Both pieces of chicken I was given were STILL BLEEDING.... No apology given to me as I was halfway finished with one of the pieces. The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the lady who took my order was very nice and polite, that's the only pleasant experience I had here. Will be taking my business to KFC down the street."}
{"text":"Had a 3 piece dark with dirty rice and a sweet tea. The chicken was hot and crispy, and the service was fast, even with 8 people in front of me. This is as good as fast-food fried chicken can get.  The only negative was that the tea was a little too sweet."}
{"text":"This Bojangles location has the worst drive thru service ever. I timed it and it takes 10+ min for one car to order and pay before they will take another order. This happens every time a have to come to this location...SAD...."}
{"text":"How bad can you mess up chicken? Sometimes, you be surprised but it all falls on the shoulders of this locations horrible staff.  I've picked up many o' chicken biscuit and bucket o' crispy from these guys over the years, so I can vouch for the flavor but thats a company thing. What ruins the \"chicken run\" is when the staff is seemingly preoccupied with some burning conversation as you pull up (which is often) or they are too quick to usher you into a parking spot to wait for ONE item from the entire order during breakfast, thereby increasing you wait time unnecessarily as you watch a stream of pther customers have their orders fulfilled. (Which also happens quite a bit)"}
{"text":"With a sign saying world famous chicken, they had better deliver...and boy do they ever.  Crispy spicy chicken and you don't get greasy hands like you do at KFC!! I love that the biscuits are big enough to slop up the gravy...maybe they need to use it like a cup for the gravy!    Thank goodness I had the foresight to buy this instead of the tacky snacks they want you to buy on the plane. I made the poor man sitting next to me cry from the smell of chickeny goodness during the flight. One thing I didn't like is that they still have the styrofoam packaging that eats up landfills. Otherwise, a good place to hunker down to get your clucks on."}
{"text":"We have been here twice since moving to South Carolina. It's really good and the staff is always nice! I personally don't like fast food but I will say-way better than KFC"}
{"text":"Everyone loves a good Bojangles every now and then. As I was driving home today I thought I'd go through the drive through as I haven't been in at least over a year. Man was I sorely disappointed!! I got the supremes combo. The girl who took my order and gave me my food was really nice however when I got home I discovered that the dirty rice I ordered was green beans and my chicken was over cooked! I also ordered unsweet tea and while it's unsweet it tastes off. There's a hint of sugar in there as well as a bit of old tea taste. I probably could have overlooked a lot except I was really looking forward to that dirty rice. This was a total cheat meal I was looking forward to, but it ended up just being a let down. I give 2 stars because the girl was so nice, and I should have checked my box before I drove off."}
{"text":"Bojangles is in general a huge letdown the majority of the time. Years ago bojangles cared about the quality of the food they served but those days are long gone. Went here tonight and was again reminded why I typically choose other fast food places over bojangles. The food is extremely inconsistent and the majority of the time is terrible. You might get one good visit out of 8. The supremes were inedible and tasted like they had been sitting under the warmer since opening. They were tough and had essentially no meat - I ended up only eating one half of the two tenders I had because that was the only part that Was edible! The biscuits are dry, they really need to work on this since they are \"known\" for their biscuits. The fries were okay but definitely under seasoned. The tea tasted like water. No joke, it was awful. They forgot to put the dirty rice in the bag so I guess we will be making another trip this week to get that. Basically I am going to stay away from any bojangles in the future. If corporate reads this - y'all need to do a much better job with quality control!"}
{"text":"BO-JANGLES! Awesome. Came with some friends on the way home from white water rafting. What can you expect? Cheap, decent fried chicken and a bunch of southern side dishes. Like a trashier KFC. If you haven't gone to one ever, you should just go to say you've been."}
{"text":"Bojangles is always a must visit for me when I am in the South.   Their spicy bone-in chicken is the best of all the chains.   They really set themselves apart with their breakfast.  Their cajun filet biscuit and their steak biscuit are absolutely delicious.  The biscuits are nice anf buttery and soft.  I usually eat half the sandwich together and then have the rest of the biscuit by itself with some jelly.  The reason for my review today, though, is because of the service I received.  I also love their dirty rice, but it is not usually available at breakfast.  That was the case this morning - no problem.  As I was on my way to my table - the woman behind the counter calls over to me and says thay they just brought the rice out and here is a side.  She could have not done that and I would not have been the wiser. That kind of above and beyond service deserves to be rewarded - nice work Bojangles."}
{"text":"I got a raw chicken biscuit. RAW! When I brought it to their attention, they didn't seem to care. In fact, they didn't say anything. They just shouted they needed another Cajun filet biscuit. Then slid it over to me on the counter. Never going back."}
{"text":"The guy that was taking orders was completely zoned out. He asked us over 10 times to repeat ourselves, then still got the order wrong. EVERY PERSON WHO CAME IN AFTER US HAD TO REPEAT THEIR ORDERS SO MANY TIMES THE CUSTOMERS IN THE DINING ROOM WAS YELLING THE ORDERS TO HIM!!! The old lady that gives out the food was given out everything wrong, the manager was in the back goofing off. I get this is fast food and you get what you pay for, but this is a little ridiculous!!! We will never come back here again and I suggest everyone stay away also!! The one star is because you have to put one, I feel like they owe me some stars"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!! UNDERCOOKED FOOD HERE!!!!   As soon as I walk into the door I see an older man at the end of the counter, he was saying something about that's why he stopped coming there because they always got his order wrong, and the cashier was giving him attitude, that should have e made me walk out then, but I had to take my husband lunch. I placed my order and waited for my food.   It took forever, there wasn't anybody else in line, wasn't busy at all, the same car was at the drive through window when I pulled into the parking lot was there when I left the restaurant. They wasn't waiting on chicken, it was piled high on the bar. The worker who packed up our order never called out our order she just gave us a \"stank face\" look. We got the our food and left, they didn't put the right food in our bag, the chicken was way under cooked and nasty!! What a total waste... very poor management here. Stay away so you don't get food poisoning or the \"stank face\""}
{"text":"Efficient and convenient, as well as not being a rip-off.   I love me some biscuits and chicken, so this always makes for a good purchase whenever I am passing through the airport and have time to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible manger on duty 12/10/2017. This employee finished working and was talking loudly to other coworkers in front of customers.  Used the \"N\" word at least a dozen times and several other curses.  All while 4 families sat trying to have lunch.  Manager talked to him across the restaurant but did nothing to stop the situation- both poorly represented your company.  I had to listen to a mom tell her young daughter that those were bad words and don't listen.  Again manager did nothing.  Shame on you for having such little respect and class.  All while another employee in red - slept at a table near by?!? What the heck Bojangles!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Today I walked in it took them so freaking long to make my food and what was the worst part they both had attitude problems talking about she ready to quite I was thinking in my head the should both be fired they slow !!!"}
{"text":"Kim should work at a pig slaughter house. She would fit right in."}
{"text":"Tasha the manager refused to accept/process my gift card on a 25.00 order.  I drove 30 minutes with my 2 boys. I did not have cash and wanted to use card for my boys dinner. I canceled my order so just my son's could eat. They brought old chicken supremes, like from yesterday. As the lady looked in box she offered to make more, knowing they were old. Manager is a black female, dread locks, and a bad aggressive attitude. She should be a worker, at best with her temperament. Never again"}
{"text":"Oh hell yes, this makes travel a whole lot more bearable.  Only downside is they don't have the fry seasoning out so I can MSG overload my chicken and biscuits as well."}
{"text":"The only reason I go back to this Bojangles is because it's on my way to work. I live about 3 minutes from this Bojangles and I work about 5 minutes from it. They are incredibly slow, EVERY TIME. If you come here expect to wait at least 10 minutes, without notice, every time. Half the time they forget something too. For the most part, the employees are rude. Even management is rude. They don't care if they made a mistake, they will make you feel like you are the problem if there is an issue with your food. If you can at all avoid going to this location, avoid it. The food is okay here, that's the only thing this location has going for it."}
{"text":"I order the bacon egg combo, the service was fast and staff was friendly. The food had a good taste. Food average $7.00 per meal."}
{"text":"Don't try and get an all white meat box. You get charged and then end up with a mixed box. This has happened to me three times at this location. The last time, I even pointed out the error and was told that they didn't have anymore white meat. Poor service, poor quality food. Hate this because I know how a well-run Bojangles' food tastes so good."}
{"text":"I'm a northerner and this was my first time at a Bojangles. Walking distance from my hotel.  Loved it. Not only was the chicken good; the sides were as well. Tried the booberry biscuit per recommendation. Wow. Got take out twice during my week stay. I'm actually craving it as I write this review. Three steps above KFC."}
{"text":"Oh Bojangles, why oh why did you do this to me?  I am not a fast food girl.  I am not a frind chicken girl.  But, damn it, Bojangles, you made me fall in love with you while I was on vacation and now here I am back in California mourning the loss of you.  I hate holiday romances!!!  That breakfast platter with scrambled eggs, grits, bacon and a biscuit...   um, YUM.  The spicy chicken filet?  WHAT?  I LOVE YOU!  And then CHEDDAR BO!!!!   OMG  What is not to like when you have cheddar cheese melted on a biscuit under a broiler??  AND THE ICED TEA!  IN A JUG!   How will I live without you?  My soul is empty without Bojangles. My tongue is depressed.    I will forever miss not just your delicious food, but staff so friendly, I wanted to sit down, hang out and just chat the morning away.  What will I do?  =("}
{"text":"This is a new location and this is my third visit.  Something is not right and I don't know other than the chicken does not taste as it does at the Bo location further north on Hwy 521.  One time was a white meat meal, breast and wing.  Was wet rather than juicy and flavor lacked.  Next was three wings and two legs.  Cooked OK, but just looking at the skin and outside of the pieces was odd.  It lacked the bumps, making it smooth skin.  Maybe it just lacked sufficient coating, I'm just a consumer, not a chicken expert.  Today I used a coupon to get the chicken supreme snack, which consists of four chicken tenders and a roll, plus the synthetic ranch dressing.  And there was that wetness when I bit into the pieces, but also the meat was soggy, lacking \"bite.\"  It is an immaculate facility with lots of trash cans (good), alert and prompt order taker and the displays and kitchen appear just to be just fine.  Condiment bar is clean and well stocked.   Need somebody other than a new franchisee to check out the chicken preparation.  I noticed that Mark C. also commented on the breading.  Maybe we are on to something, at least a clue to be pursued.   Sorry, Bo.  Just calling it as it is."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean the staff is so friendly  We stopped for a quick bite and all I can say is the chicken is fabulous  The sides were great fresh and delicious For fast food this is awesome"}
{"text":"This Bojangles has horrible service. The employees stand there and talk to each other while customers wait at the register waiting to place an order. They didn't seem like they knew what was going on."}
{"text":"Really tasty fried chicken. Mashed potatoes and biscuit were good too but the fried chicken is definitely worth a try. I got a breast piece which was extra juicy and tender.  The line was constant here at lunch time at terminal B so as expected it was fresh chicken. It's kinda oily but hey it's fried chicken, what do you expect.  On a side note, the Cajun filet sandwich (bun) was a 4/5 according to my wife."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some tasty chicken. I like the seasoned fries and the chicken overall. I think this location is by far one of the best. I am a fast food professional. The staff are efficient and kind. Its in a great location close to other stores. I hope you enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"I stopped by in the middle of the breakfast rush to pick up 2 dozen biscuits for work. The line moved quickly and the cashier was friendly and efficient. She greeted everyone with a smile and a \"good morning\".   As soon as I ordered she walked back to the kitchen to make sure they would prepare my large order. I had never been to this location before, but Ms. Jackie really stood out for me. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love Bojangles. The food was great, but the customer service was unpleasant. The cashier took my order gruffly and I was handed my food gruffly."}
{"text":"Just ordered and 8 piece meal  and for the second time we got old chicken and all wings. No wonder it only has 2 stars"}
{"text":"I took my grandson to this Bojangles yesterday ( 10 Oct 14)  a little after 1pm.  What a train wreck.  Although there were just a few customers it was a long wait for someone to show up at the counter to take our order and  very much longer to get our small order.  As I waited  I observed that the entire  floor in the back area where the food is prepared was littered with trash and what appeared to be flour.  The large trash cans in the back and in the dinning area where running over.  There were four cans that I could see and all had trash stacked on top of the cans.  My grandson who is five did have some fun  as we waited by trying to stomp some of the several  flies that entertained  him (he actually got two and a gnat).  The counter for customers to fill their drinks etc, was wet from drinks spills  and a large pile of  melting ice and some other mysterious liquid.  Both coffee dispensers were empty and the container for cup lids was empty except the two lids in the larger size. The dinning area floor and some tables were littered as well.   As you may have already guessed - yes-our  order was filled incorrectly.  Bottom line I would not recommend anyone eating there !! They need to do some serious cleaning up and new management !!!! Actually this is posting on my wifes name but if was me  (Mike) and my Grandson. She must  have signed up with you all before !!!! As a side note we had trouble finding a number for them. They must not want calls only e mails, we did e mail them and have not heard back. We called and finally after some research (Had to google it)  for a while found a number . No one has bothered to call us back so this must not that important to them !!!! Never going back !!!!"}
{"text":"If you have been to one then you have been to them all, this Bojangles is very clean and I haven't had any order mistakes ever. I hope I didn't just jinx myself with that statment. I will say that their drive thru personal is so extra polite and they are like every other establishment of late. They are stealing  the signature Chick-fil-A  line \"My Pleasure\". I know Chick-fil-A wish they put a patent on that one...lol  Well I have to hand out a 4 Star rating, due to the lack of free WiFi, but other than that maybe I will see you in the drive thru line or at the counter, if I feel like the drive thru is too long. No need to sit down and eat, my house is .4 miles away. I am paying for Wifi there so i might as well enjoy my chicken on my couch and Yelp away.....   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Living in Texas makes me miss the small things like Bo-berry biscuits. This particular Bojangles was in route to my destination. I went during breakfast so there were little to no customers. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. A little slow but nice all the same."}
{"text":"I'm a Popeye's guy, but there isn't one around here, so sometimes I head to Bojangles if I'm looking for some spicy chicken. I had a bad experience at a different location several years ago, and it has turned me off to EVER ordering their chicken pieces again. I'm writing this after eating a big dinner, so I won't share what happened so as not to risk losing said dinner.   But, I digress. Bojangles is convenient for lunch if I have to eat while I drive, so I go with the chicken tenders. Regardless of which location I visit, I always avoid the drive thru window. I want to be able to see what they are placing in the box. One of my pet peeves is when there is a picture of one thing on the menu, and something totally different served to me. In the case of Bojangles, it's what the tenders look like. On the big menu board, they look plump, scrumptious and so big it's a wonder that anyone could ever finish them in one setting. In reality, they are slightly overgrown chicken nuggets. If I spend $8 for a boxed lunch, I expect a decent sized serving. Especially since the picture looks so damned good. As for taste, I like their tenders. Not as spicy as Popeye's, but still tasty I don't do sauce since I drive while I eat, and I don't use ketchup for the fries for the same reason. Their is enough flavor in the said food that it I'm not missing out by skipping the sauces. I'm also not a biscuit guy, but I have been known to nibble on the ones from Bojangles.   The service at this location is typical fast food, slow and slower. If you are looking to have a pleasant conversation with your cashier, go elsewhere. I can't really blame them, it must be tough working fast food."}
{"text":"I had a three + hour layover at Charlotte Douglas International airport, and I arrived at 7 am, east coast time, so it was 4 am for me.  I wasn't feeling all that hot, and though I wasn't hungry, I wanted to try to sleep at my gate, so I thought I would take care of eating to get it out of the way.  Being from CA, I had never heard of Bojangles before, but I thought I would give it a shot, since they 1) had breakfast and 2) were right there when I got off my plane, so it took very little brainpower to decide on what to eat.    I got the egg and cheese biscuit meal, which came with a drink (I got OJ) and \"botato rounds\" which were silver dollar sized hash browns.  I opened up my biscuit and was pleased to see it wasn't some tiny little thing, it was warm and it smelled good.  So I took a bite.  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  It was SO good.  As soon as I took my first bite I was immediately starving and all sense of not feeling well dissipated.  The biscuit was so tasty, I couldn't believe it.  Buttery and salty and everything a good biscuit should be.  The egg and cheese balanced it out perfectly, so it wasn't dry and difficult to swallow.  I scarfed it down and considered getting another one.  I was pleasantly surprised by the little kick of spice on the hash browns.  Nothing out of this world or anything, but more than just a salty taste (they could have been a tad warmer, but still good, nonetheless).    I had another long layover on my way back, and this time it was around lunch time.  I was so tempted by that breakfast sandwich, I almost got another one (since you can get breakfast all day), but wound up trying the 2 piece dinner with a breast and thigh, a biscuit and a side (I got mashed potatoes and gravy).  It's been a long time since I have had a piece of fried chicken, but I can say with confidence that it was way better than I remember KFC being.  The chicken has a kick, too, and while it certainly wasn't over-whelmingly spicy or anything, it did register as more than just some flavoring thrown in there.  The mashed potatoes were just fine, nothing amazing, but very satisfying eaten with my biscuit.  For a fast food joint, it certainly exceeded my expectations!  If I ever pass through Charlotte Douglas International airport again, I'll be eating here!"}
{"text":"we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought, great! Landed late at the airport, let's go get some of their famous Dirty Rice, Fried chicken and fixings.  When we finally reached the order box at the drive through order station, the young lady's voice kept cutting in and out of the speaker.  We thought :\"well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \"no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!  We have never been to this side of the state before....is this how you all treat your customers? No wonder Disney World is making a killing in this side of the woods!  There's got to be better employees than this...  Suffice it to say we will NEVER eat at your restaurants in this area if your employees are this horrible to their customers.  We will not frequent any of your businesses here because of your poor training methods."}
{"text":"These five stars are for the deliciousness called Bojangles!! Remembered we had one in Chicago in he 80s, it must've been before it's time or just unsurvivable in the north, either way just as delicious as I remembered as a kid. If you're in the airport and want some good and filling, stop over and grab a Cajun filet biscuit with the hash browns. I'm so very happy. Five kisses!"}
{"text":"Ok... So it's a Bojangles... Once you've been to one you've been to them all. Why 4 stars? Because I ordered 30 Bo-berry biscuits for my students and they made fresh ones in about 5 minutes. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Food is always really good i love bogangles, specially the chicken biscuits. Although this location needs, or I better say it must improve as far as performance. The drive thru is a nightmare and even if you walk in the service is really slow. And it is not as if the place is full with people. I would just recommend maybe better management. I am here waiting for my food and i had time to write this review. In the mid time the is a line of about 10 cars. Inside they are 11 people in line and in the restaurant there are only two tables with people seating eating. And i mist add every time i come is like this. Slow, slow, slow"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Unprofessional staff with zero apparent management. No visible desire to offer adequate service. More interested in talking and laughing with each other than completing orders accurately and quickly. I stood in front of the counter for TEN minutes and was never asked why or if I needed something."}
{"text":"This is the worst Bojangles in the Chlt area.  You can guarantee a 10-15 minute wait, even if you are the only person in the restaurant.  Service is lousy, and you better check your order."}
{"text":"Had a meeting in Charlotte today and decided to get a quick lunch on my way back to Cornelius.  Turned out to be anything but quick.  Service is virtually non-existent.  2:00 pm in the afternoon with no crowds and no rush and it still takes 5 minutes to place an order and even then, was informed it would take an additional 5 minutes if I wanted there version of a tater tot.  Granted the food was good and having good food will take you far but that is not enough to be successful"}
{"text":"Love Bojangles but this one is horrible. You ALWAYS have to wait around 30 minutes, or longer, for your food. It's ridiculous. It's called fast food for a reason... this is not fast food."}
{"text":"Don't usually review fast food joints but I do love Bo's and this one was particularly well-run (despite being a little dated atmosphere wise.) I order the same thing every time - a double ham on an extra buttered brown - and they nailed it. That's rarely the case. Also, service was friendly and attentive, the manager came by to check us and the sanitary rating was a 98. Hey I can't ask much more than that!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Bojangles fan but this one is not one  of the better ones. Although not a regular customer, I do stop in from time to time like this past week. I do not envy the manager as good part-time help is hard to find."}
{"text":"This place is so consistent but I swear I get a different character in the drive thru every time. It's always a joy to hear the southern granny, the Happy morning guy or the over the top gentlemen over annunciating his words. Thanks for the food and a show"}
{"text":"Worst and slowest Bojangles EVER! This place is so ghetto and ratchet I swear I saw a drug deal go down. Waited in the drive thru 25 minutes for a drink. Girl at the window was nice."}
{"text":"I have to give it four stars, becuase it is Bojangles, and they do have both cajon chicken biscuits and sandwiches, however, it's way overpriced, even for an airport.   The dining area is shared with another restaurant, but seems big enough for both.  The service was a little slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if I could give zero stars, I most definitely would. I just went through the drive thru and spent 20 minutes waiting in line. Besides the slow service, the girls at the window were joking around and had horrible customer service. After I finally received my food I then had to wait 5 minutes for my drinks to be made...and of course they got the drink order wrong. They took one drink to the back out of my sight which is also questionable and they even forgot to put my sauces in the bag. Let's just say I won't be returning to this location until there is a turnover of staff or management."}
{"text":"This is the original Bojangles, but they have many locations around town.  Bojangles is Charlotte's rip-off of Popeye's, and it's delicious.  They have great deals on chicken dinners, and tender chicken supremes.  The macaroni and cheese and the seasoned fries are the best side items on the menu.  The biscuits are out of this world, and you usually get a hot one.  If you are feeling decadent I recommend the sweet potato pie or the bo'berry biscuits.  The only reason I give this place 4 stars is that it is a fast-food restaurant, so the service is spotty- make sure to check that you got everything you ordered."}
{"text":"You can come in the the convention center and order here, even if you aren't a guest here! Service was quick, not that friendly, but whatever. One star off because they got my order wrong and I didn't realize until I had already left. But good, standard chicken and biscuit!"}
{"text":"The food here was about the equivalent of KFC, and pretty good. Juicy chicken and great biscuits. My issue is that service. Every step of the way, the staff at the counter hollered out to those of us waiting in line. \"NEXT CUSTOMER\", \"EVERYONE MOVE OFF TO TH SIDE UNTIL YOUR NUMBER IS CALLED\".  We weRE being herded like cattle and shouted at just because the staff was overwhelmed. When my number was called, I went up with my receipt and the girl shoved my container at me.  As I situated my things to be able to carry my container, she continued to keep pushing it at me, as if she had some weird robotic tic. NO human or pleasant customer contact here."}
{"text":"Me: I'll have two Cajun club sandwiches. Bojangles: Pull around for your total. Me: Ok. (Pulls up to window) Bojangles: You had tenders and fries? Me: No.... two Cajun club sandwiches. Bojangles: Hmmm I don't see that. We only have tenders and fries. Me: You only have what? Bojangles: No sandwiches. Tenders and fries. Me: Kthxbye"}
{"text":"This is rated 3 stars only because I had extremely low expectations for this place. Naturally, I ordered the first thing I saw because I am frightened by gross fast food like this, but I had to \"try it\" since I was in North Carolina for the first time. I ordered the Southernest thing I could find which was the Cajun chicken with biscuit buns and potato fries. It was gross, but delicious at the same time. If I am ever in the state, I will never try it again. But if Bojangles is at the airport, I will stop by on a layover."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant exiting the terminal,  with a name like bojangles i HAD to try it. I wasnt completely sure what to order so i asked a few people and they recommended the chicken rice bowl.   I ordered the chicken rice bowl and sweet potato pie. It came out really quickly and i also grabbed several bags of hot sauce to go. The chicken rice bowl is so good!! It comes with a large portion of chicken, dirty rice, beans and cheese on top. Its pretty salty though, so you might get bloated if you eat this before you fly. The sweet potato pie had a nice flaky cinnamon crust and a decent amount of filling.  Great way to try a Charlotte chain if youre bored of the other airport food."}
{"text":"I saw her from a distance and went running through the airport like a late flight. No s#%+ there I was stumbling through Charlotte international airport when I noticed a bright yellow sign as a distant blur...  no wayyy!!! BoJANGLES.  I quickly picked up the pace as my flight was boarding in 5 minutes.   The menu was just as a remembered it. I could see the golden brown biscuits through the glass and the chicken strips in their glorious nakedness. I ordered the 4 piece tenders and cajun fries with a side biscuit and a classic Bojangles sweet tea.   Living on the westcoast now I haven't eaten at a Bojangles in over 10 years. I wanted to order so much more, but I knew that carrying a giant bag filled with succulent chicken COULD cause another viral airplane video. So I kept it simple. I grubbed on the walking path and enjoyed that blistful moment of deliciousness. If you are anywhere near B gates....just do it. Make your way to Bojangles amd treat yourself."}
{"text":"Although the drive-thru is shaky at best, the food is still delicious. I have enjoyed every meal that I have ever eaten here. Bojangles' in general just does their food the right way. Fresh meat and never frozen. Wow! My mind is blow because of how good this place is. It's off the chain. Bojangles' on 51 is where I grew up. I am but a young lad just remembering all the memories I made here in my prime days."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bojangles for the 1st time when we had a layover at Charlotte Airport. I'm not a big fan of fried chicken, but thought I'd give this \"southern\" joint a try.  It wasn't bad. Didn't taste a whole lof of a difference from KFC. I didn't like it as much as Popeye's.   Price was very reasonbable, and there's plenty of seating next door."}
{"text":"Having never been to this airport, or NC for that matter, Bojangles was a foreign name to me.  But after trying the fried chicken (at 7:30 in the morning), I will forever tell my friends that it's a MUST try if doing a stopover in Charlotte!  Bojangles serves up some legit, piping hot, fresh, crispy, fried chicken.  And for breakfast, the tots in the meal are slightly onion ring-flavored and awesome.  I normally don't care much for biscuits, but, damn, the biscuits are buttery, dense, and pretty irresistible!  We liked it so much that we made sure to hit it up again on our second flight through Charlotte.  Bojangles... please come to LA!"}
{"text":"Getting a quick bite is hit or miss here. Sometimes the fries are hot and the sandwich isn't swimming in mayonnaise. Sometimes the fries are so overly seasoned they're inedible and the sweet tea is fresh, not sour."}
{"text":"This bojangles is the absolute worst. I came through and waited 3 minutes until someone even took my order and then waited over 10 minutes for food and they also said they were out of biscuits. They probably just didn't want to make anymore of them. They also forgot to give me sauce.  Shit service I will never come back."}
{"text":"30 minute wait at the drive thru because these young kids are too busy playing around and not treating their job like a real job! All the young girl could offer was 1 free cinnamon biscuit, smh!! Management really needs to take a look at their younger employees work ethic and behavior during business hours. One of the employees consistently locked the young girl out when she was trying to let us know about the extensive wait. The young girl stated that an employee didn't hear her call our order which made us have to wait an additional 10 minutes. I would do the survey on the receipt but \"ironically\" one was not given to us!"}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up a Bojangles, somehow they have done just that. Dirty, slow, and the chicken does not taste very good. I love Bojangles, not this one, keep driving."}
{"text":"This Bojangles is new, modern, delicious and has quick service.  I go here only when I have a craving for a country ham biscuit - yummy!"}
{"text":"This Bojangles should be taken over by the corporation before this franchise hurts the reputation of the brand.  We live near this Bojangles thus the only reason we subject ourselves to this location (its in our neighborhood).  Management here is extremely lazy and this is really why the staff do not care at all, never a please or thank you among so many other issues such as...on our last last few visits (always at the drive thru) I have not been given what I ordered, I have seen employees eat fries off the steam table which is a big infraction on the health code, they never give you a receipt I guess so they think you can't report what is going on, the wait on the drive through can take up to 10 minutes with only 2 cars in front of you and now today a real winner at the drive thru they told my husband they were not serving chicken today...well I could not believe this when my husband called me at home to tell me this so I called the store and spoke to the manager Andy and he said it was because they were closing at 3:30 but I informed him that it was only 2:30 when he and I were speaking so this made no sense since they are a chicken restaurant, he then told me they were understaffed due to the weather which is understandable but then why he being a manager did he not do what a manager should have done and rolled up his sleeves and get on the line as this is what is expected from a real manager no someone sitting on his ass just counting the minutes so he can close the store and go and have a snow ball fight with his friends. I am going to contact the corporate office and see what they have to say but if they do not take what I have personally witnessed seriously then I will make sure to let everyone know what a sh*t show this place is and hopefully we can get a good franchise in its place."}
{"text":"This location has the worst service of any Bojangles' I've ever visited.  The straw that broke the camel's back was my last visit around 9:30 on a Saturday morning.  After receiving my biscuit and my coffee cup I went to fill my cup and there was no coffee (which is not uncommon).  I went back to the counter and asked the lady to to fill it from behind the counter.  Her reply, \"we're out of coffee\".  Huh?  Why did you hand me a coffee cup knowing you were out of coffee.  And how can you be out of coffee at 9:30 on a Saturday morning.  The manager was standing right beside her the whole time and never said a word.  There are numerous other stories I could tell about this location, but I will drive past this location the next time I get a hankering for Bojangles'."}
{"text":"I was in North Carolina for a wedding. During the reception, the dinner was mainly seafood dishes. This sucks for people who don't like seafood or are allergic. There happens to be someone at my table who was one of those people. SO, instead of eating what he doesn't like or can't eat, homeboy brought his own meal. GUESS WHAT HE BOUGHT?!?   BOJANGLES FRIED CHICKEN!!!   He kindly offered the whole table his fried chicken but none of us wanted any because we didn't want the man to suffer watching us eat a multiple course meal.   The next day, my friends and I were hungry and we immediately decided we wanted to try Bojangles. We're from California and we don't have Bojangles (but we do have In N Out) so of course we need to try Bojangles.   We ordered a 12 piece combo with 6 biscuits for 5 people plus 1 large sweet tea.   Sweet tea - tastes like McDonalds sweet tea to me. Ive had better so this didn't really impress me.   Biscuits - some of the best biscuits I've had. They were fluffy, not dry at all. So good!!!   Fried Chicken - OH MY GOODNESS. Blown away by how freaking juicy the chicken breast was. It was even dripping juices. There is cajun seasoning on the chicken and it gives it a little kick - makes the chicken breast really delicious. With the breast so damn good, everything else has to be good and it was. Everything else was juicy in the inside and crunchy fried on the outside.  This has to be one of the best fried chicken I've had. Maybe I was lucky and got a really special batch. I won't know until I come back again. And maybe it's because I'm from California where the fried chicken just isn't as good - although they just opened a Gus's Fried Chicken in LA and they're pretty damn good.   Can't wait until I come back to a Bojangles again!!"}
{"text":"I had the Cajun Chicken Filet Sandwich and it was really good! Of course it was overpriced but hey it's the airport, what do you expect. You've got to try this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of greasy and oily food but didn't have much of choice since I needed food togo to take on my flight back to SFO. The workers were friendly and helpful. Overall, good and happy."}
{"text":"I miss Charlotte, though now when I go back, the fast food ain't so good on my stomach. Bojangle's  is always on the list when I go back to the QC. Definietely get the Bo Berry Biscuits and Bo-Tato rounds!! UMMM....."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through because there was only two cars in front of me and the inside had many people. The service was so slow. By the time it was my turn it took her a little while until I could place my order and then i still waited and waited and waited for the one car ahead of me who seemed to order just 2 combos ! I ended up being late for my appointment. My advice is don't expect this fast food place to be fast- be sure to have time. I still have them two stars because the food is usually good just the service struggled today."}
{"text":"Horrible store. The service was incredibly slow, the staff got our order wrong, and the cashier didn't know what he was doing. Avoid this location - it will take them over 5 min to ring up a simple order and then you will have to wait another 20 min for your food. Their chicken supremes were inconsistent in size and we received 3 that were the size of a chicken nugget!! Horrendous."}
{"text":"I stopped by Charlotte on my way from San Francisco to Rochester, only 40 mins or so change over time. I rushed from Concourse C to Concourse B just for this famous southern flavor chicken and biscuit. To be honest, the biscuits didn't fail my expectation: really the best that I've ever eaten in US. But the chicken, despite the crispy surface and tender inside, was a little bit mild and weak in flavor. Anyway, it's wonderful to taste something exclusively offered in southeast region."}
{"text":"Wow I just never knew their food was so good. I have heard about them. And since this was right next to my terminal. It was yummy the chicken and rice. This place is the best chicken out of all the fast food places I have ever been to. I wish there was was one near my home."}
{"text":"Worst Bojangles ever.... Close it , and put a Popeyes in its place.... It's really to bad that the Corp Bojangles peeps have done nothing about this? It's a great and safe location... The food is just never fresh.... biscuits dry at 7 am in the morning. Have to wait on Chicken at 5 pm? That should be prime time selling...."}
{"text":"I really like this bojanges , there chicken is so good and crispy. The brisket are so buttery. And there mac and cheese , green beans , mashed potatoes are awesome . The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Bojangles corporate is terrible about quality and consistency control. I would say half of them are disgusting, most of the rest aren't great, but a few (like this one) are just awesome every time. It's definitely worth going the extra few miles to go to this one!"}
{"text":"At first blush this is just another southern fried chicken chain. I stopped here because I like chicken and it was not far from my hotel. Based on the name I was hoping for a more Cajun experience but it's really just a substitute for KFC or Popeye's. I don't think that the chicken is anything special but it's not bad either. I liked the real gravy with potatoes and the pintos had a flavorful seasoning to them, tasted like chili powder and maybe cumin. The sweet tea is good too. This was going to be a three star review until I tied into the Bo-Berry biscuit. Wow! That was amazing. That alone puts Bojangles past Popeyes and KFC."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast on a Sunday around 2-3pm. I understand that breakfast isn't in high demand all day, but I haven't sat in a line for bojangles line for 5-10 minutes like I have this one. My biscuit was crunchy and warmed over from a heat lamp like it was sitting there all there all day. My sausage patty was not juicy, it was hard and chewy. It took a while for the bo rounds to come out. Two or three people behind me in the drive thru got their food before mine. Maybe I was wrong for ordering breakfast or this location isn't reliable."}
{"text":"Took over fifteen minutes in the drive thru for a $3.99 combo order, no apologies, no nothing. The food was at least made fresh though, very hot and had not been sitting under the warmer all afternoon."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Even though their speaker box was broken last night, there is no reason why it should have taken 30 minutes when I was the 4th car in line to get a smile $3.99 combo. The lady at the window didn't even say thank you or have a nice day, even though I did say \"How are you?\" And \"thank you good evening\". I will not return to this location due to the multiple chances I have given this location."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, the biscuit I keep hearing about is tasteless flat and dry, the chicken is soaked in oil. The cajun beans weren't bad though. Its just not my thing."}
{"text":"First time at this place, never seen them in Dallas tx where I live. We ordered 12 pc and it was yummy  right amount of heat and it has nice crunch perfectly done and the biscuits were surprisingly delish. This place is to go to for fried chicken while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's a shame this new Bojangles was supposed to be a \"new concept\" but yet they staff it with the same incompetent people. I have never witnessed such a \"shit show\" even in a fast service environment. Employees that clearly don't care. Disgusting restrooms. I pity the owner of this particular location. All this money spent and can't get any better people to run it."}
{"text":"No Stars -simply disgusting. When I bit into the leg the barely cooked meat dripped a mixture of oil and water. I squeezed it between my fingers and more dripped out. The thigh the same story, the fries were passable but I was too disgusted to eat any of it by that point.  I dropped the whole tray at the cashier, told her why and walked out. $6 wasted.   Drove a mile up the road to Chick Fill A, which is not terrific but at least is not crap. I'm continuously amazed at the love people have for what in my book is garbage.  edit: I've been told that possibly the water came from the chicken parts being dropped into the fryer before they finished defrosting. Sounds plausible considering the batter looked cooked but the meat not so much."}
{"text":"There is something about this bojangles location that is magnetic on me. From the days when i use to live across the street from it and the aroma had you floating in at least one a week, to my riding past it a few moments ago and the marvelous aromas of freshly fried chicken gently but firmly lured you within, capturing you with its taste. Thus location is well kept and a delight to be trapped at."}
{"text":"I went inside for breakfast... There was a young lady at the beginning of the line who seemed frustrated so I asked her if someone had help her yet. The young lady said someone helped her but she was waiting for her receipt so I mentioned that I believe the receipt may be attached to her order.    There was a young lady mopping the floor who continued to call out \" Customers up front!\" No one acknowledged the lady mopping the floor... A young can came up front and smiled at the young lady who walked in the side door by the drive up window... This person from the can that was waiting for her order from the drive up window was obviously frustrated but he didn't acknowledge her either.     By this time other people came inside to place an order... The young lady mopping the floor came up behind the counter by the register and said \"someone will be with you soon\" and called out again \"customers up front \". Now, to no surprise, still no on acknowledged her nor came up to take orders.    I decided that for me, it time to leave.   The Food Score Rating is 95"}
{"text":"This is the best Bojangles restaurant around by far!  Some of the best staffing I've seen in the city.   The design of this location should be the blueprint for all other Bojangles."}
{"text":"It is a shame that a business like BoJangles which is headquartered in Charlotte has such crappy restaurants in the area. I've been to this one several times and they are out of chicken at 6 p.m.? Really? You're at the beginning of a dinner meal period and no chicken? I don't know what has happened to the size of the chicken breasts, but the ones I get ( when they have them ) are half the size they used to be. They do not listen to you place your order. Routinely do not include condiments that I ask for, etc. I'm fed up with this location. It sucks. It doesn't deserve to stay in business."}
{"text":"Patient drive-thru folks. They KNOW you are getting a Cajun fillet, but they ain't gonna rush you about it. Right off the highway so get you some!"}
{"text":"Bojo's! This one isn't bad, clean and fast. And well, tasty as all bojangles are. This one is near my house so this is probably the one I will go to when I have those bojo cravings Delhomme used to have."}
{"text":"Bojo's! Who wouldn't want some, especially if your from out of town? Bojangles is a chain, so it's sort of the same everywhere in North Carolina. However, I did hear that Bojangles near Raleigh doesn't have as many choices as we do down here in the Queen City.  I came here with friends and well you know they're famous fried chicken. It's cheap and it's not bad at all. This location of Bojangles is close to my house so I don't mind to come here if I'm craving for a chicken sandwich (what I usually get) or some fried chicken.  If you would ask me where to go eat fried chicken that's cheap and fast food, I would go to Church's. But, their sandwiches are an amazing substitute if you don't want that grease all of your fingers."}
{"text":"So, this is a first place to go if you like fast food and you're from a different part of the country. Bojangles is one of the only franchises that is big in the Carolinas. For me, as a native Charlottean I have never heard of not having Bojangles to go to. I'm not a big fan of fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits (however, they are delicious) but I love it when I have the craving for it.   If you come to Charlotte, this should be one of the places to go to when you land because it's something you can't get anywhere else except the south. It's soul food from the south easy to get and the availability is wide. However, there are a lot of other places to go eat for soul food as there are other restaurants famous for fried chicken. But for the sake of fast food, this is one of the places I would go to. Great hangover food."}
{"text":"This Bojangles' is terrible. I went with a large youth group in a group of close to 50. The line was EXTREMELY slow (it took us 35 minutes to get through it) and the management wasn't great. The employees seemed to be taking their sweet time, in no hurry to feed us at all. So if you are able, go to a different Bo's. (We unfortunately don't have that option.)"}
{"text":"Made my first trip to Bojangles while visiting Charlotte this past weekend... I LOVE biscuits and this was clearly the place to go for that! I ordered some chicken, mac & cheese, a plain biscuit, and 2 cinnamon biscuits... the best part of the meal was clearly the biscuits... other food was just ok.  I love these biscuits, especially those heavenly cinnamon biscuits!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time is an experience. One time we went through the drive through and the girl could not comprehend what was being said to her. Not sure if she was on drugs or what. The last time we went, we dined inside. There was nobody in line and a few people walking around the register. We went to the register and the people who worked there walked away. We waited over 5 mins if not more for somebody to come back to the register. The gentleman asked me what I wanted to order and right as I was speaking he walked away, his tag said Director which is really surprising. Another guy came to the register and took my order but got it completely wrong and I corrected him and the food we received was in correct. We decided to just eat it because we didn't want anymore trouble."}
{"text":"I prefer Bo Derek and even Beau Bridges to Bo Jangles. But that's just me.  This location of this southern franchise is just inside South Carolina outside Charlotte. This location of the massive Southern Fried Chicken Franchise is pretty typical as far as BJs go. Ahem. Their products are significantly better than Chick-fil-A and comprable to KFC. They are very bad for you but it's worth a try if you've never been to one of these before.  So give BJs a try."}
{"text":"This is a typical fried chicken franchise joint. The quality of the food is predictable and good. When you have a craving for southern fried chicken while traveling, this is a good place to stop.   The staff was friendly in that southern hospitality way. The food remained hot during the 2 minute trek back to my hotel room. Most importantly, the price was right...cheap."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on a layover going to San Juan, Puerto Rico. I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. They put mayo on my sandwich in which I said not to. I ended up going to the burger king across the airport, all they had was breakfast items granted this was about 2 or 3 in the morning."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly convinced that this location has something against children. I am a full grown adult but anytime my pockets or my hunger is on \"E\" I order a Chicken Supreme kids meal and not once but EVERY single time this location gives me extra hard chicken supremes and old cardboard  warm fries. Think I'm gonna have to start letting them now that I am grown but just on a budget. Smh"}
{"text":"This is what it is, decent fast-food chicken and biscuits. Nothing fantastic but I wasn't expecting fantastic for $5 for the total check. Overall everything was tasty, the place clean, and the staff surprisingly friendly for fast food."}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot. I was on a two hour layover, had only about 2-3 hours of sleep under my belt, and needed some comfort food. Bojangles definitely delivered in that aspect.   While the concourse was pretty busy (7:00 AM on a weekday), the line was tolerable and moved relatively quick. I found it to be a pretty efficient operation; a friendly woman took my order in the line and gave me a receipt to eventually use at the register. Despite the relatively light line everyone in the kitchen area seemed to be a bit stressed, the individual at the end of the assembly line kept on forgetting to hand over drinks to customers with combo orders. The adjacent dining area is shared with a bagel shop and felt a bit small considering the relatively high volume of patrons that morning; I was lucky enough to find a table clearing out.   I ordered the Cajun Fillet biscuit combo, which came with a side of bo-tato rounds (hash browns).. and somehow a cinnamon roll got thrown into the mix. The fillet was buttery, spicy and really hit the spot. The potato rounds were bite-sized like Burger King/Hardee's but were about 5x thicker and simply divine. The cinnamon roll was good.. I'd like to someday try the delicious looking bo-berry biscuits on display. This was my first breakfast at Bojangles, and I was impressed.   All in all, for the amount of food and inclusive drink I received, I found the price ($7.50) to be very reasonable for CLT.. The other day I desperately paid $13 for a simple sandwich and bottled water from a Wolfgang Puck kiosk during a short/hectic connection caused from a series of thunderstorms that crippled airport operations."}
{"text":"Warning... This location is highly NOT recommended!! I just left this place 15 minutes ago! Get all the way home just to realize the girl at the window never gave me my receipt or credit card back. Careless of me not to double check before i left! Had my 2 daughter's asking for their food as the girl in the window was rushing my food out the window! Now i know why. Before i exited out my car i dumped my purse out and checked throughout my car. No card anywhere in site. I checked the food bags. No card! I then called the restaurant and politely advised the rep that the girl at the window did not return my card to me and would she be so kind to check with her. She yelled something out and got back on the phone and said their is no card here. I reiterated to the rep that i have not gotten out my car from leaving their location and i do not have my card. She proceeded to say aggressively  'well Mam I'm telling you there is no card Here!.'   I am not one to point fingers or jump to any conclusions until i know facts. Clearly in this situation you have an employee with integrity issues, a manager with poor customer service skills and a deceitful restaurant. Clearly showing they are only a product of their environment.    I hope they realize that the theif has caused them a very loyal customer and i will be taking further action! At the end of the day God knows and they have to deal with whatever Karma comes their way!"}
{"text":"Strongly suggest you just drive by this location and find another one.   Biscuits are usually burnt or hard as a rock.  They have repeatedly left items off my order.  They are continuously out of items on their menu which I assume is poor management being they aren't keeping up with inventory.  I live two minutes from this location and now drive two exits down to S Tryon where the food and service is much better."}
{"text":"Why oh why are there no Bojangles at home in Philadelphia?  Probably because they know I'd be 400 pounds if there was...  My very first visit down to Charlotte right after my mom moved down, she told me she discovered this place that's \"fast food like McDonalds but has breakfast all day long.\"  She knows how to get my attention.  Breakfast?  All day long?  I was sold.  We went over and I ordered a breakfast sandwich.  We sat down in the restaurant to eat and the smell that hit my nose as I unwrapped my sandwich was making my mouth water like crazy.  My first bite was pure bliss.  Salty, buttery, soft biscuit filled with freshly cooked eggs, smokey bacon, and cheese; I was instantly in love.  A few visits later, I was introduced to their hash browns and that also was love at first bite.    Since then, I've eaten at Bojangles probably two dozen times.  It's the only thing I want for breakfast when I'm in Charlotte and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it."}
{"text":"Getting off a red-eye flight at CLT, I literally (yes, literally) half-sleep-walked into a long line of people queuing up for Bojangles. As is the custom while sleepwalking, I joined in on the adventure. I became fully conscious a couple of minutes later when the guy with headphones wanted to take my order. My lips spit out the last words my brain recorded from the suited dude before me in line: \"cajun filet biscuit combo\" (pause one second) \"po rounds\" (pause one second) \"pepsi\". What the hell did I just order??  I would give the end results of my sleepwalking adventure a B/B+. The cajun filet biscuit itself was delicious like my favorite junk-food breakfast item (McDonald's Sausage Biscuit), with a chunk of larger better juicier meat but at 4x the price. I would skip the po rounds the next time. Also, they charged me extra for the soda... shame on them, taking advantage of the sleepy. I'll give it another try the next time I see a Bojangles without the airport-food price tag."}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was moist and flavorful with a nice crispy outer crust.  Very simple but also very good."}
{"text":"What can I say, I was in Charlotte for about 60 minutes and managed to eat at a Bojangles!  Reminded me of old times.  I had a connecting flight, was starved and it was the last stop on the way to the gate.   It worked.  Sweet tea made my teeth hurt.  Chicken had just the right amount of spice.  Biscuit was buttery.  Dirty rice was tasty.  It worked  in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Yuck.  Make sure you're sitting near the lavatory on your flight... or just run away from this place.  High price.  Fried pieces of #inappropriateforyelp   Rude service.  Long creepy 6\" fake fingernails on staff - neon green and orange.  Not the type of thing I want handling my food.  Bleh!"}
{"text":"Dude, I'm from LA and I love Popeyes.  The dirty rice was actually better at this place.  The chicken and biscuits were good but I'm not sure about it being world famous.  I would give this place 3.5 stars but I added the .5 star because this is pretty damn good food for the airport.  Oh I almost forgot.  That sweet tea.  Ahh yeah, so bad but so good. No wonder I get so fat when I'm traveling.  Hahahah."}
{"text":"fast comfort food. Being from california I was def interested in trying Bojangles because there is literally 1 on every block. It is right next to a church's chicken and I was tempted to just go with what I am familiar with. But what would be the point in that? So this tastes like a bland kfc. I had the cajun filet and mashed potato. Meh"}
{"text":"While I have no issue with the food at bojangles, the service is always terrible and slow no matter which location I visit. I went through the drive thru on 3/18/18 at around 2:30 pm and there were only 2 cars in front of me. I waited 20 minutes which was my choice. I could have left. What aggravated me is the fact that the employee at the window not only gave no sort of even half hearted apology but didn't even say thank you or here you go. Nothing at all. Just handed me the food and walked away. I was very polite and didn't say a word about the wait. I am just tired of always getting bad service. I work with clients and if I treated them this way I would not have a job. A simple thank you have a good day goes a long way."}
{"text":"My first Bojangles experience. I can honestly say I DO understand the hype! I got the cajun chicken biscuit sandwich. It was yummy. No better quality than any other fast food, but better taste than others. A solid choice for the airport."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot, even though I could see the reviews were pretty bad.  Well, the bad reviews are well-deserved.  I pulled up to the drive-thru at almost 7pm on a Friday night.  I get the.. \"..  Take your order (not in the friendliest way, but whatever)\". I then ask for the 8 piece meal w/2 sides.  3 seconds later.. \"We don't have enough chicken\".. but more like,\"don'thavenuffchick\"...  In the most mono-tone, does not give an F, blurted way.  I thought, maybe I misunderstood..b/c it was really quick and mumbled. I politely said, \"I'm sorry, what was that..?\", and again, but a tad more clearly, a totally unapologetic person says, \"DON'T HAVE ANY ENOUGH CHICKEN.\" .. .and then silence..... . No, i'm sorrys, nothing.. just, we don't have enough chicken.  Wouldn't even give me the courtesy of not making me guess at what they do have.    .... Mind you, running out of CHICKEN, when you are a CHICKEN place, already insane.. but to not even act like you care in the slightest.  Where is the mgmt?  They probably don't care, either.  I'd let running out of Chicken slide b/c S happens... (Even though who in the hell doesn't prepare for a Friday night when you ARE a CHICKEN joint), but to not even apologize & to clearly not give 2 shits, unacceptable. This place obviously is in dire need of new mgmt and customer service 101 classes.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"I've never been impressed with the service at this location. It's a coin flip on how it would be on any given day. Today I tried the BBQ sandwich. It was good. Strong hickory flavor, didn't taste real. But it was a good sandwich. I'd have it again."}
{"text":"My kids had their usual Bojangles order. Supremes meal for one and kids home style tenders for the other. They both said this was one of the best Bojangles they have had in a while. They were impressed with the way the box was packed- neatly and the sauce container was not touching their food.  The food was fresh and hot and the service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"They got that Chicken! It's like I'm sayin. Mash Potatoes! Biscuits, check! Gravy for that donkey! Correct Change? Nope!"}
{"text":"Bojangles your biscuits are a little lump of heaven for my belly!  If you live in Charlotte you will undoubtedly come to the realization that there seems to be a Bojangles on every other corner. Yes this true and no need to question it just be thankful.  This location is a newer one over in the Meyers Park shopping area. It is perfect when the craving for a chicken biscuit takes you over. The staff was very kind and friendly much more like a next door neighbor. The only negative was running out of sweet tea. What a scandal! I am not a lawyer but I believe it might be against a city ordinance."}
{"text":"It's not the most incredible Bojangles I've ever had, but it works great in a pinch and especially when considering the other airport food options. Yes, the lines can be annoying here, service can be a bit forgetful with one's order, and the prices are naturally higher by virtue of being in CLT. Sometimes the need for fried chicken will best all of these issues and considering there is no Bojangles where I call home, this is sometimes the best compromise I can make.  The premise is simple. Wait in line, figure out the simplified menu, and order, as quickly as possible. If it's past 4pm, be prepared to be told certain items are no longer available. Take advantage of when there is no line and know that seating is going to be limited but at least the turnover is quick.  Also know the average dinner combination will run one about $10. Know your drink ahead of time and if you're down with the fatness, Bo-size the combo for an additional 79 cents. Don't bother with the mediocre Cajun Pintos (beans), Cole Slaw as side options. Consider the Dirty Rice or Mash when in doubt, but the seasoned fries will always be in their own category.  When I'm feeling lazy, I'm rocking a Chicken Rice Bowl ($8), which is very KFC-esque and if I'm feeling nostalgic, I'll shoot for the 4 piece tenders ($9). Breakfast is served at all times, which is nice. The biscuits are awesome on their best days, but bricks on their worst.  Beware, the salads are not worthy. It's either not enough meat and greens or too much meat and not enough greens. I can't speak highly of the sandwiches either but they're solid for people who enjoy a good bun. I prefer to slice the biscuits in half and stick a piece of chicken in there somewhere and slater in some of their infamous hot sauce. It's really food coma inducing, especially prior to a flight.  Lastly this is all the way in Terminal B (B9, to be specific). If you're lucky, the flight might just land in the same corner. If not, you'll have to trot past the main food court in the middle of the airport and head over to this spot. Do not come here in a hurry. There is a chance it'll be awhile before your food is actually ready."}
{"text":"So bad that it's good. Steak, egg, and cheese biscuit should be my morning ritual. But I won't; even though I want to. It seems that I can smell the buttery biscuit from miles away and I refrain from making it a habit.  You know you can pre-order an entire fried turkey and sides during the holidays right? Look into it. While I haven't personally ordered one, I've eaten some and, well, it was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Just waited 20 minutes in your drive thru AFTER ordering to be told at the window that you are out of wings. No manager, just a girl with a blank stare who looked like she didn't know what was going on. FAIL!"}
{"text":"Sunday Morning of Memorial Weekend - - on the way to the airport for my trip back home I drove by and found Bojangles on the opposite side of the road.  I had these guys on my Yelp Radar due to the respectable reviews.  As soon as I saw there was no line (YAY!) I did a U-turn to stop in and grab something for the flight home.  I wanted to get some variety so I could just eat it later if need be.   So the story goes - -   - Chicken & Biscuit - was pretty good, probably one of the Top 2 things I ordered here.  The biscuit kinda fell apart, the chicken was pretty good, not really crispy good as described in other reviews, but respectable.  I would get this again.   - Potato Rounds - this was the other Top 2 item probably because it was piping hot and fresh.  Very crispy, tasted great, I'm just glad there was only 5-6 because I could easy over-consume these.    Now it starts the decline from 4-4.5 stars to the 2 star experience:   - Egg and Bacon Biscuit - not that great, didn't seem as fresh, the bacon was....meh.    - Coffee - that came with my meal was lukewarm, and I asked for cream and didn't get jack squat.   - Ham n Cheese Biscuits - they were advertising a sale on these, don't recall the price, but I got extra for later but took a quick bite to check out the quality - - yuck.  These looks like they were sitting on the warmer ten minutes too long.  The ham was solid like cardboard, the cheese.....?  Let's not go there - - these were horrid and should not have been served.  If I wasn't on my way out I would have gone back to return them and get a refund - - yeah, that bad, Bo....that bad.    The customer service was sort of friendly, more business-like and she tried to get me out of there so there was a sense of urgency.  I could tell she was held up by something cooking - either the Chicken or the Rounds.  I was kind of in a rush so that could have caused her to forget the cream for my coffee.    Had the rest of the sandwiches been as quality good as the Chicken and Biscuit, it would have been a stellar experience for this chain.   Unfortunately in this case, Bo doesn't know consistency."}
{"text":"I was excited for a cajun filet biscuit with cheese. I went thru the drive-thru. They were completely out of lemonade. The lady that I was ordering from had a very poor attitude. The lady at the window that got my food from and paid did not speak to me at all. Horrible service.  They received 2 stars because the food was good."}
{"text":"The staff here are just plain rude. I was looking for a salad..something quick for lunch before my flight boarded. I thought a salad might be nice/speedy and so I ordered what I saw on the menu. In the middle of my order the woman at the cashier on the right (at 1045 am on Wednesday June 13th) interrupted me and put her hand up in the air to shut me up. She then proceeded to lecture me on what salads were available. She actually said \"let me interrupt you right there\". She slowed down the line just to lecture me that my wording was incorrect..... I work in customer service and speak with the public every single day. I KNOW there are nicer and much friendlier ways to go about correcting someone. Also.... context clues. She could obviously infer what I was trying to order. I told her I wasn't interested anymore. I then promptly walked over to Starbucks and had a friendly exchange with a barista and walked away with a turkey pesto sandwich. Thank you Starbucks for having customer service. Bojangles in the Charlotte airport-you have a lot to work on. This may seem trivial but customer service is really important. ESPECIALLY in an airport."}
{"text":"\"JIGGA JIGGA, CALL THAT GIRL BOJANGLES\".... YUM-O CHICKEN!  I was SO excited to see Bojangles in the terminal during my 2-hour stopover from Miami and I'm really glad I tried this place.   Notes:   -The biscuit was humongous.... but it was the most boring biscuit I'd ever eaten. So much so that I actually gave up halfway through eating it and let my brother have it. It wasn't creamy or buttery or flaky enough for me. It was just.... bleh... a biscuit, and I probably could've made better at home.  -Loved the sweet tea, because I'm a fanatic for Southern-style sweet tea.   -The chicken was the real prize. Crunchy like popeye's, tasted like it was marinated in Cajun spices too. We didn't order spicy but there was just this kick in the back of your throat from the chicken that made your mouth say \"Hello\".   -The fries were REALLY salty. I thought side dishes were supposed to help balance out the salty flavor between the main dish (the chicken)? Um no, each bite was like a flavor explosion that I didn't necessarily enjoy all too well: spicy chicken, salty fries, sweet tea, repeat. Oh wait, maybe that's where the bland biscuit comes into play?   Anyhow, the prices are almost reasonable but definitely more expensive than any other fast-food fried chicken joint. The largest family dinner (I think it was an 8-piece with sides) in order to feed a family of 5 cost us $30 and we were still hungry afterwards. So you're telling me it would've cost us $60 to satisfy us?  Would I go back? Yes. Would it be worth it? Probably not.   My advice: Skip the mumbo-jumbo hoopla sides and just order the chicken and a sweet tea. You'll feel much more fulfilled."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Went in the other day on lunch. Chicken takes like old grease, fries taste like they cooked it in same old grease. Went inside to mention to manager and smelled like old burnt oil all in store.... Worst lunch break i ever had"}
{"text":"The food was overall good and fresh but the chicken was too greasy, maybe the grease wasn't hot enough?"}
{"text":"Had the best customer service here this morning!!! Stopped in with family that had came to town for my fianc√© and I's engagement party the night before, before they headed their separate ways. Made conversation with the gentlemen who took our order and food was great!  After awhile to top it off he brought us a round of BoBerry biscuits as a congratulations! So nice and thoughtful!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to wait and be ignored by the staff this is your place.  17 minutes for a BoBerry biscuit."}
{"text":"I swear this bojangles messes up almost every order.  Why are these going up everywhere in NC??  Wish we had more breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"$4.99 for 4 chicken strips, crispy fried juicy white meat with a sweet BBQ sauce and a big flaky biscuit!  Yeah!  I promise to start eating healthier tomorrow...  Uh, maybe?"}
{"text":"I'd probably go on record and say that Bojangles is my favorite restaurant haha. It always puzzles me how sometimes not enough chicken is prepared, but the menu is great nonetheless! I am especially happy that cinnamon biscuits were brought back! I'm not sure how long they've been back but I know there was a time when Bojangles was pushing pecan twists in place of cinnamon buscuits. Since they're back I can order one cinnamon biscuit and one bo berry biscuit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far the shittiest bojangles I have ever been to. I dont believe anyone in there knew what they were doing. It took 15 minutes the make two Cajun fillet biscuits and the chicken was extremely raw. I would only recommend this place to someone who is trying to catch salmonella."}
{"text":"Dirty, slow, and disrespectful workers.  I suggest avoiding this Bojangles and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went through the drive-through on a Sunday for lunch, and the service time was ridiculous. We ordered three meals and a six pack of BoBerry Biscuits. They said it would be five minutes for the biscuits and to pull up. After waiting for over 10 minutes we decided to go inside to see what was going on. Apparently they didn't start on the biscuits right when they put the order in, so it took a little longer. So needless to say a quick drive through meal took almost 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said I don't sometimes choose to connect thru Charlotte so I can visit Bojangles.  I think others do the same thing, this one is always busy...always! But, they generally move the line pretty quick and you are in and out fast. It's more kiosk but there are chairs next door shared with a bagel place. Of course it is more expensive than a stand alone store given it's in the airport, but it's worth it. The food is always consistent with outside restaurants and I will forever eat the hell out of a cajun filet biscuit.  Can't wait for my next connection thru Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The service here tonight is not that great. I blame bad management for that. Ownership needs to get new managers or train existing managers to be great at what they do and you'll stop getting negative reviews regarding service. I don't blame the workers."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles. But this particular Bojangles has fallen off. Hard. I used to come often because it's so close to my unit but the manager here is terrible. I've worked in the food industry before and I've never seen a manager with a worse attitude or a with such poor customer service skills. Patrons inside the restaurant were discussing how she was in there throwing things and how she has tried to deceive customers by giving them chicken tenders rather than the supremes that they asked for.   After she cut the mic off on me in the drive thru and walk away from me mid question, I don't think I'll ever be returning to this Bojangles. Judging by the other customers who had to face her piss poor attitude, neither will a lot of others. Which sucks because the lady who normally takes my order in the drive through is always pleasant but that manager needs a different job that doesn't involve customers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some quick fast-food to take on the car for our drive to Natural Bridge, VA. I had yet to try Bojangles so wanted to try their chicken and biscuits.  Service here was pretty mediocre, hence the three stars. The inside is a bit run-down as well, although it is clean.  I got a steak biscuit (chicken fried steak on a biscuit) combo with dirty rice as my side and sweet tea as my drink. The tea was okay. I loved the dirty rice; it was super flavorful albeit a bit salty. The biscuit was good but a little dry; would have been great with some gravy. My brother enjoyed his chicken tenders, and I liked the pecan cinnamon twist, although could have gone without the icing.  Bojangles is a pretty big chain, so nothing special about this particular location."}
{"text":"After waiting in the drive through for about 15 minutes. Only one car in front. I pull upto the speaker and wait about 2 more minutes.  before I said hello and got a \"please hold on for a moment \" wait for another 3 or 4 minutes. Finally get to give my order, one 4 pc chicken supremes comb and mac and cheese instead of fries. Then pull up to the window. And waited another 20 or so minutes. While I watched the manager and other employees walk about the store. Some were even trying to avoid eye contact. I only saw one customer inside. Finally the manager brings a box with him to the window. Opens it and ask what my drink was so i remind him it was a sweet tea he goes and gets it and comes back. We finished the transaction. And I went home. I know I should have checked before leaving but to wait one more second, was not a option. No straw, fork for the mac, or dipping sauce.  Even though I asked for one, not even napkins. Food was still good and satisfying. Luckily I took it to my home so i had utilizes and condiments."}
{"text":"A rookie from out of town on a janky layover with nowhere to go. I've seen glimpses of this fast food joint on numerous shows so I knew my curious ass had to try it.   Nothing spectacular but hey you get what you pay for. Being that it was at the airport I didn't expect much and I also needed to just eat.   The chicken sandwich was OK. Not bad at all. I'd eat it again as long as I'm about 6 or 7 deep on scotch."}
{"text":"If you are ordering to go, check your orders. Their employees occasionally have trouble counting."}
{"text":"Sorriest Bojangles anywhere! Dirty. Never, never, never get orders right when it's more than 2 orders. Food is not hot or fresh ... anytime of day. Stale bread. Soggy fries. Greasy I expect. But they take it to new levels.   Not just a one time occurrence. Lived here for 13 years. They've sucked for at least the last 5. I swore I'd never go back, but was desperate tonight and couldn't drive the 6 or so miles to another Bojangles. Won't EVER make that mistake again!  Still sorry."}
{"text":"We are from California and We went to this place on recommendations from a couple of people. Well we we're very disappointed in the food, the customer service. First of all, we were rushed through the drive-thru even though there was no cars behind us as it was late at night. Even after telling the gentleman that we had never been here before, the menu board was half lit up because the bulbs being burned out. Anyway, The Cajun filet sandwiches were so over fried that I felt like I was biting into beef jerky, the fries were cold and soggy, and even the sweet tea wasn't sweet and after a few minutes after the ice melted it tasted just like water. Very disappointed in this place, Chick-fil-A is way better. I will never go to this place again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Bojangles in the area. The food is always cooked properly,  the building is kept clean, and most of the employees are very nice. The only issue with this location is that the line inside can get pretty long, but that's common at most fast food locations. I will return!"}
{"text":"I typically wouldn't take the time to review a fast food chain but the overall experience was so terrible that my children wanted and insisted that I YELP about it.  When we walked in the door two of us almost busted our tails because of the wet and greasy floor.  There wasn't a caution sign indicating the floors might be slippery....definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen.  The service pretty much sucked.  The folks acted like they didn't want to be there and appeared bothered when we asked them for extras such as ketchup and hot sauce.  The guy in front of us left mad because they couldn't seem to get his order right.  As my son said their \"legendary sweet tea\" wasn't very legendary.  It tasted old and not very sweet.  The fries were greasy and not hot (pet peeve of mine with french fries).  To top it off the place looked and smelled dirty.  Pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there.  Or maybe there's a reason for that...."}
{"text":"Chicken was very crispy and tasty, and the biscuit was really buttery. This was a pretty good airport meal, and cheap when compared to other airport food."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I got the BoBox and mashed potatoes and gravy, and mac n cheese as sides.   Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Bojangles is a must get if you're able to. I always get the 4 pc chicken supreme basket and an extra order of cinnamon muffins. Service was great, but the wait was a little long, probably due to the fact that there were a ton of people in line to order from there. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Bojangles in Charlotte hands down! Staff is very friendly and personable, management is always on high alert asking if there's anything you need or they could get you. Line always moves fast and they've never got my order wrong. The manager Willy, has always been very welcoming, assertive and has always had a great attitude with everyone I've seen him interact with including myself. Thanks for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fried chicken and biscuits for having to mow them all in a matter of 10 minutes.  The tenders were great, the biscuit was great but the french fries were oversalted as hell.  Plus I didn't get any BBQ sauce with my box, thankfully my buddy Jon had an extra one."}
{"text":"Check your food before you leave the drive thru because they consistently give out thighs instead of breasts. Know your chicken, ppl!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I love bojangles and all but the girl was rude and didn't say thank you or even acknowledge us! She gave me a large cup of iced tea instead of sweet tea and it tastes like dirty water instead of tea. If possible, go to another bojangles!"}
{"text":"I love bojangles, u wanted to show a person from the north how great it is. I was very disappointed by the service, it was absolutely terrible. She got our order wrong and didn't even ask us what drinks, just assumed we wanted sweat tea. Completely embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've never had this before and I found myself constantly comparing it to Popeye's, Church's Chicken, and KFC. Either way, it was AMAZING. The chicken was absolutely mouth watering with the right amounts of spice and flavoring. The biscuits were huge! So flakey and buttery and the mashed potatoes...all of it together was just a filling and hearty meal."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Bojangles until I moved to NC. Although we had them in Florida, it never drew my attention. I must say I prefer it over any other chain Chicken spot. I especially Love their breakfast! That biscuit and gravy with bo-rounds are delicious!!   The service is friendly and the food is good! My ONLY complaint about this location is how COLD it is inside. You have to hurry up and scarf down your meal before the A/C gets to it.   Other than that I enjoy having lunch here whenever I have a chicken craving."}
{"text":"Worst Bojangles in Charlotte. Friday night, out of green beans, no napkins, receipt, cutlery....the guy asked me what sauce for the supremes only to what? Not put it in the bag. Overheard them say they were out of the 2 piece chicken...wow. Change the name from chicken and biscuits then."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. Employees lack listening skills. I asked for crispy bo rounds, I get chewy. I asked for a light biscuit, I get the opposite. Not everytime, but too often. Other than that, polite people with good customer service, and fast service."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Always go during the day. The night shift is ratchet! Seriously! Very selfish with bags. They will try to stuff everything in one bag. Dining area is clean."}
{"text":"In desperate need of new management and staff. The service is incredibly slow. I waited in the drive thru for about 20 minutes and there were only 5 cars in the line."}
{"text":"I had an unexpectedly lengthy layover at the Charlotte airport during my recent venture to the midwest, and discovered there was a Bojangles just down the corridor from my connecting flight.  I wasn't too hungry, but I couldn't pass on the chance to sample some of the \"famous chicken & biscuit,\" as the signs proclaimed.  I opted for the chicken tenders, or \"supremes\" as Bojangles named them, along with a biscuit.  The chicken was excellent.  The breading was crispier than I'd imagined, and gave it a nice crunch.  The chicken was juicy.  The biscuit was good, but definitely not the best ever (that spot is reserved for Popeye's).  Bojangles is definitely a worthy stop for a meal or even a snack if you find yourself at the Charlotte airport with an appetite and little bit of time."}
{"text":"How could they even make a bojangles this bad. Been trying to get breakfast for 45 minutes, 3 people working and no one seems concerned that there are 30 people waiting impatiently for service.  Oh and when I did get my food, my biscuit was completely raw. Gooey. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Awful. Every time I go here the same thought goes thru my head, these people are so rude. If they could at least get my order right, it would be one thing. Lots of nerve sucking at your job AND being rude on top of it. Cold food, confrontational staff, and overall terrible service. If your response to me is.... \"it happens all the time\" maybe you are doing it wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say, even though this location is literally 5 minutes away, which is perfect for my Saturday morning hangovers, I will definitely be heading to a different one in the future.   Bojangles's, I love you. I do. But here, you've failed me.   This location was definitely the worst one I've ever visited. To start, the building and interior was a little old, outdated, and dirty. But since it's Bojangles' I'm not really weighing too much on that.   What made this location the worst was the service. To start, the cashier was not paying attention at all and repeatedly misheard our party's orders. Even though it seemed like we finally straightened it out at the register, two of our items came out to us incorrect.   The most surprising/disappointing aspect was the manager's behavior. I fully understand that the fast food business is, well, fast. But the way he talked to customers was borderline unprofessional, but at the very least unpleasant. I was taken aback when an older gentlemen was struggling to explain the menu item he was asking for and the manager clearly was rushing him in a rude manner."}
{"text":"Very quick..not quite as good as outside airport but still pretty darn tasty"}
{"text":"One of my airport \"go-to's\" as a flight attendant.  I love their sweet tea (it's a traveling splurge), spicy chicken strips and dirty rice...YUM!"}
{"text":"Food is normally fresh, but the average time I spend in the drive through is 10-15 minuets. During my last visit I ordered sweet tea but the tea seemed to taste sour.. Don't stop here if you're in a time crunch, and taste your drink before you leave the window, lol"}
{"text":"This particular location does not serve Mac n cheese! Such a disappointment, had to settle for the bagel next door."}
{"text":"After a rancid Popeye's sausage biscuit in Dallas airport and a semi-fulfilling pretzel to make up for it, Bojangles was a grand sight to see during my first trip to Charlotte Airport. The Wing Dinner with mash potatoes did not disappoint. A nice welcome back to NC even if it was the wrong side of eh state."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but as a first timer the staff wasn't quite as helpful as I'd hoped. The convenient location is what made this one stand out, but I'm assuming there are better locations with a bit nicer customer service AND good food."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles food but the staff here completely sucks. One of the cashiers was extremely rude, cutting people off during their orders, rolling her eyes at customers and being extremely aggressive to people simply trying to order their meals. I have had rude attendants before but I was completely shocked by her behavior. I am completely taken aback that an airport would allow such poor customer service even at a fast food dining place. I felt like I needed to personally apologize to everyone attended by her. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"YAB... Yet another Bojangles and that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Same as they all are on the food. The service at the drive thru window however was very-very slow. I don't normally eat at this bojangles but it was on my way out. You lose a star because of the slow service.  I had the BBQ Sandwich, which I am very glad that Bojangles has brought back! Pretty darn good coming from a fast food restaurant.  Sweet Potato Pie, my-my are they awesome"}
{"text":"If you don't mind subpar customer service then this place shouldn't be a bother for you. I came to this location twice within the month hoping for better attitudes from staff, but no. The morning crew at the drive through seems to be out of it, practically throw your food to you or don't greet you at all. Like put some pep in your step. I also found some mold on my BoBerry biscuit box, but that's another story."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION! I hate to complain but in this case I have no choice but to tell everyone to be aware for this location. The service is hands down the worst I've ever experienced.  The guy infront of me ordered a large drink and waited long before me just for a cup. I ordered a gravy biscuit and waited 10 minutes while an employee just ignored the line building up behind me doing busy work filling up the ketchup. And acted like serving the customers was an inconvenience to her. Another lady walked up from the back and started prepping the over flowing orders. The girl with an atitiude was scratching her belly under her apron in front of the line of people. I had finally got the gravy biscuit I ordered and I couldn't help but to notice a LONG BLACK HAIR laying across one of the biscults I asked for a refund and left. If you enjoy horrific service and hair embedded in your food this is the holy grail of your typical run down lowsy fast food restaurants. #itwillneverbeBotime #bojangles"}
{"text":"Ordered some chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy.  I expected normal brown gravy.  They put sausage gravy on my mashed potatoes.  Not sure whether they didnt have any regular gravy or they were too lazy to make it and used breakfast gravy.  Not good."}
{"text":"I come to this Bojangles' location because it is easily accessible. I realize it is a fast food chain and that the food is mainly the same from location to location.  I walked into the dining room today and the girl at the cash register didn't notice me until I addressed her because she was texting on her cell phone. She didn't know how to ring up my order. Maybe she's new. I understand that but the standing at the counter on your cell phone bothered me because there were two other staff members at the counter doing the same thing.  The restaurant was empty as far as customers go.  There were staff eating in he dining area and doing some sort of computer training.  The food was fresh and tasted good. I had the chicken supreme combo meal. It was delicious. I enjoy the seasoning they put on the fries.  The dining room was a mess. It was dirty and extremely untidy. Sadly I will probably continue to go here because it is good food but I was disappointed in the service and cleanliness of the the restaurant."}
{"text":"Literally had no change.... we waited for 10 mins as line grew and people left. When them returned with change it seemed they were frustrated with us. No thank you. I will not return."}
{"text":"I've been on some kind of biscuit binge lately, so I've been frequenting Bojangles quite a bit. They have the most amazing biscuits ever in the history of biscuits. I get mine with just cheese, so I can get a delicious buttery-magical breakfast for less than $2. It's good stuff.  The service can be a little sloppy, but hey, it's fast food. Fast food service is never perfect. I like taking folks from out of town to check out our own special fast food, and they are always impressed. The french fries are magical as well, and I can't forget to mention the dessert wonder that is the Bo-Berry biscuit."}
{"text":"So disgusted! I was happy that Bojangles had a special for $5 wing dinners. I got it and the food was pretty hot but I saw two small pieces of hair in my chicken. It's safe to say I won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"This girl loves her fried chicken.  Once upon a time, I spent my first year of college in North Carolina. Bojangles locations were in no short supply, and I was always excited when people-who-had-cars would suggest a trip. We alternated between Bojangles, TB and Cookout. (Oh how I miss you, my Cookout!)  When we missed our Charlotte connection, before even leaving the plane, I turned to my friend and said I hoped they had an airport Bojangles. It was 8 a.m. at the time, but oh well. I had been up since 2:30 a.m. so it was basically lunchtime.  Sure enough, we got off the plane, looked at the terminal map and eventually made our way over (after getting beers, of course). I was so thrilled to be in the presence of Bojangles again that I asked my friend to take a photo of me with their sign. I assume all of the staff members thought I was a total nutjob, but it's okay!  Opening my chicken sandwich and seasoned fries took me right back to the 2000s. Thank you, airport Bojangles, for the wonderful nostalgic meal. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"This Bo's is TERRIBLE! Will not go back to this one, there is another one a couple more minutes away that is 10x better. They actually acknowledge you. I have given this one a chance several times, they have never had wings when I went to order them, which I find odd? On top of that tonight I went to order a salad for dinner, I was greeted and started my order, I was waiting for a response and did not get one. I said hello a couple of times and finally was told to wait. It was raining no less, didn't really want to keep my window down that long. I waited another 4 minutes and drove off. I will not go back to this one."}
{"text":"I really didn't care for the breakfast steak biscuits.  The meat patty was coated and then deep fried.  It was impossible to tell what type of meat it was.  Eating it between the biscuits....it was like oil on oil.  The biscuit itself was ok.  But I would not go there for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fast food fried chicken. About the same quality as a KFC. The chicken is battered and fried, but at least the biscuits are made fresh every hour or so. Its a southern chain (I live in Hartford CT and havent seen one here in the north) but they are popular fare for football games, picnics, etc.  Honestly, there are a lot worse options for fast food, because at least here you know you are getting chicken (as opposed to pressed chicken patty), but you are better off getting a rotisserie chicken from a grocery store."}
{"text":"I love this bojangles, every time I come in they know me and are always nice even when they are busy, they really notice their customers, everyone here is a team player and the food is always great! Dawn and Kattah are the absolute best always ask how my day is and never rushes me when I don't know what I want, they actually help by recommending stuff I haven't tried before and explaining the new stuff"}
{"text":"This is exactly the reason I go to Chick-fil-A!  I went to the drive thru for breakfast at 6:20 am and 4 cars in front of me waiting to order and no cars at window. Took 5 minutes before I could order and another 4 minutes to get my order. Parking lot had few cars and was not busy inside. I ordered a meal to include coffee but was not asked what I would like in it. I get to the window and there was no good morning, no thank you, no question regarding whether I wanted cream and sugar, no acknowledgement that I was even there. I received my food which included my biscuit, a whopping 4 bo-rounds, which where luke warm, and black coffee. I will not return to this location for sure and will be very hard pressed to go to another Bojangles since this has been a trend when I visit this brand."}
{"text":"Hah, Bojangles. Been here almost 4 months now and only JUST visited my Bojangles for the first time last night. At 10:15pm. The hours are only until 10pm, but we didn't know that, so they just gave us whatever was left over. 9 pieces of chicken, 4 biscuits, 4 containers of coleslaw, fries, and a jug of pink lemonade. The cashier thought we were crazy, but he was nice.   Biscuits were good, super buttery, fantastic with some honey. Fries had a nice flavor to them, but too salty. Coleslaw was average. and I was told the chicken was tasty, but not as good as KFC.   Location is convenient on the corner of Randolph Rd and Sharon Amity."}
{"text":"The Manager on duty \"Donna\" overcharged my family for the meal then after she corrected it the food that was given was OVERCOOKED, so I requested a refund. My family was disappointed. This is Strike 2 for this particular location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience there waited 10 minutes to get my food then watched the cashier go into where the food is prepared didn't put gloves on didn't wash her hands made my food and then proceeded to tell me when I asked for someone else to make my food because she touched my food without gloves that she didn't touch my food argued with me and gave me a hard time when I asked for my money back!!!! I will never go back it was horrible!"}
{"text":"As far as fried chicken available in an airport when you are waiting for your next flight - it's adequate. It has all your favorite items (or items that you tolerate when you have to eat at a Bojangles) and serves it up pretty quickly.  The airport price-gouging mark up that you would find at any eatery in an airport is here, but given the Bo's normally low prices, it won't hit you to hard in the wallet.   Biggest issue? Limited table seating. If the airport is even remotely busy, be prepared to have to carry it to your gate and balance your Styrofoam container precariously upon your thighs while you try eat in the shitty faux-leather chairs."}
{"text":"I drove by a Bojangles and had no idea what it was. The colors got me thinking of Pollos Hermanos and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it was a front. The fried chicken reminded me of Popeyes and Churchs combined. It wasn't the best but not the worst. The $5 deal for 2 pieces + 1 side + drink was pretty decent but I think if you are hungry it will not be enough food."}
{"text":"The breakfast biscuits are too greasy! This is awful!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is your standard Bojangles fare. Good food. Once you get inside past the panhandlers that are at the front door on occasion."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst drive thru experience of my life. We ordered a BBQ sandwich with no coleslaw and a 4 piece tender meal. Easy enough right? We go to the window to pay and the lady at the register asks what our order was and we repeat it. So we go to the second window after paying and we are handed a Boberry biscuit and a drink and then asked AGAIN what our order was so we told them. When we received our food, my girlfriend looked in the bag and our order was wrong so we had to park and go into the place just to get our food! It's fast food, not rocket science. We won't be going to this location again but we do love our Bojangles."}
{"text":"Stopped for a connecting flight in Charlotte and dropped in at Bojangles located close to my American Airline gate and I am so glad I did! I'm not a big fan of airplane food so I typically grab my flight meals before boarding.  Heard a lot about Bojangles and wanted to find out for myself just how tasty they are and they did not disappoint! I ordered a Cajun Chicken Biscuit and it was quite a treat!    The Cajun season had a nice flavor to it and the crispy chicken amplified that awesome taste, the biscuit added to that savory meal and I enjoyed every bite of it!  Definitely a must visit every chance I get to one!  The staff at this American Airline terminal were fun and they let it be known! The vibe echoed throughout the terminal and it was a positive way to do business! Thanks Bojangles!!"}
{"text":"Food is just fine. The amount of prostitution going on during the day is alarming.  Jesus help these women."}
{"text":"Back in Chapel Hill there was a Bojangles two miles from my house, I move to Charlotte and its the same story. Its amazing that I am not fat because I have been eating the same Chicken tender dinner with large fries and iced tea for years. Bojangles is without a doubt, wings down the best fast food chicken place around."}
{"text":"I used to pull into their drive-thru several times per week on my way to work, from late 2003 until early 2012.   My breakfast of choice was primarily a country ham and egg biscuit. Why? Because they're delicious, not healthy, but really tasty. I sometimes ordered their other choices: steak egg and cheese, sausage egg and cheese, etc., but their country ham and egg biscuit is the best.   Their hash rounds were hit and miss, either VERY good or very greasy trash can fodder.  Their coffee was okay, and their sweet tea was good and inexpensive.   I seldom had any problem with their food, in fact I can't remember a time when the food was truly bad or inedible.   I also don't remember ever receiving an incorrect order, which now that I think about it is pretty amazing.   What lowers their rating to a mediocre two stars, is their speed of service, or rather the lack thereof. THIS PLACE IS OFTEN PAINFULLY, FRUSTRATINGLY, $#%$@#% SLOW!!!   I usually pulled in here at 7:15 to 7:20 AM, against an 8 AM start to my work day. About half the time, I would have to hustle to get to the office, which was only a couple of miles away. Why? Because  they were so blessed slow about taking orders and moving the drive-thru line expeditiously. And most of the drive-thru attendants didn't seem to give a rat's ass whether they took orders quickly. Tick tock, tick tock, you're making me late for work! Aaaargh!!!!!!  Eat here if you want decent food, but stay away if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This is just what we needed as a pick-me-up for our 4 hour drive to Myrtle Beach from Charlotte. The people were friendly, the food was good, and it was fast service. It reminded me of a Wendy's type atmosphere. All of the Bojangle's we passed were packed, including this one. They have a really great business, and although they are a huge chain, it was nice to try for the first time. Besides, a chicken biscuit? Who could pass that up?!"}
{"text":"Terrible Bojangles! Always slow and orders filled are usually wrong!!! And I tried them more than twice! Don't bother!"}
{"text":"They say they serve legendary tea yet they can't seem to serve yet they can't seem to serve you tea that hasn't gone bad. How hard is it to taste the tea on a regular basis to ensure that you're not serving your customers teeth that has gone bad. Simply lack of quality control and management."}
{"text":"Food is always on par here, but drive through service couldn't be much slower. Terrible attitude from morning window workers as well, assuming this is also why they can't work more quickly. Have been waiting in drive through for 15+ min. And still 3 cars back. . ."}
{"text":"It's Bojangles aka the Catalina Wine Mixer, what more needs to be said. This place is fucking awesome and the cure for any hangover. 4 pc supreme combo FTW. The sweet tea is the nectar of the gods, and if you don't like the seasoning on the fries you should probably check your pulse."}
{"text":"It's 8am, you're hungry, and you want to indulge a bit on a breakfast sandwich.  Where to go, where to go...light bulb goes off...Bojangles'!  So this whole \"Oh, I'll only go to Bojangles' once in a blue moon\" has completely turned into me going here at least once a week.  I often order the Bacon, Egg and Cheese on a Biscuit (if i'm feeling really bad, I'll add the Bo Rounds).  Every time I've had it, it's great!  It's not messy, the biscuit is light on the inside with a slightly hard crisp on the outside...it's just good and I haven't found anything else that quite compares.  I wasn't sure if breakfast was a fluke, so I went one day for lunch.  I got a salad with grilled chicken that was surprisingly a good sized, fresh portion!  I just had to order the fries, which have this awesome seasoning on it.  I've never waited in line very long, no matter what time if day I'm there.  The staff in the drive-thru line is so incredibly nice, which I can't say about every Bojangles' in this city.  Only downside is there coffee isn't very good, but seriously, I'm not going to Bojangles' for the coffee, I'm going for the biscuits!"}
{"text":"The food is standard for a Bojangles, but the last few times my family ate there our food was a bit off. We have experienced everything from dry, old,and salty fries to rock hard brick biscuits. But at least the managers always offer to replace our orders during our next visits."}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence when it comes to Bojangle's.   \"Gasp! Did he really write that?\"  I know, I know. Bojangle's is a Carolina institution. But, I'm not from the Carolinas. I grew up on the border of Texas and Louisiana, where we had ample access to both Popeyes and Church's.   Bojangle's Chicken is tender and juicy, but it just lacks the flavor I prefer.    Anyway.. this one on Monroe is the Bojangle's I visit most often because it's the closest restaurant to my job. Boy do they take forever to make your food.   For example, I started writing this review a good 10 minutes after I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. It's now been another 10 minutes and I'm still waiting.   Fast food, this is not.  ***Update***  After waiting in the drive thru a few more minutes, I parked and went inside to check with the manager, who told me 'Chicken Salads' normally take more than 10 minutes and seemed confused when I explained that I ordered a chicken SANDWICH. Needless to say, it's now taken 37 minutes to make me a grilled chicken sandwich.   Note: they did throw in some free fries for the inconvenience"}
{"text":"Rudest employees I've ever encountered. And don't bother trying to complain because the manager is worse. Waited more than 15 minutes for an order while I watched multiple others get their food- saying something only made it worse. Literally felt bullied by the time I left. I'll never go back and they're incredibly lucky I didn't take further action. I've told everyone I know in the nearby vicinity how awful they are- including how slow their drive thru is. Worst fast food experience I've ever had, and that's saying a LOT."}
{"text":"Soggy skin on chicken.  Chicken breasts were huge though with lots of meat.  First time eating here.  Also the biscuit was just blah, not bad but not good either.  Would rather eat kfc.  Wasnt awful, just okay"}
{"text":"After 5-months in Charlotte I finally made it to Bojangles.  Man, I must have thought about dropping by on 100s of occasions, but it took Chick-Fil-A being closed on Sunday to make me jump on in.  Bojangles reminds me of a Popeye's Fried Chicken that has a Chick-Fil-A selection.  Their menu is rather diverse and includes both the breakfast and lunch items I generally like from Chick-Fil-A.  They have a chicken biscuit that's pretty comparable to Chick-Fil-A and that says a lot considering Chick-Fil-A has a crazy good breakfast menu.  Unlike Chick-Fil, they are open on Sundays, so they already have me any Sunday of the year.  Another aspect of their menu I like is that they serve breakfast all day long.  Chick-Fil-A doesn't do that and that makes Bojangles have a sweet place in my heart.  Speaking of sweet, there is nothing sweet about Bojangles outside of the tea.  Their food has a kick that puts them on par with Popeye's.  I tried both their chicken sandwich, (not as good as Chick-Fil-A, but better than Popeye's and KFC) and their 8-piece chicken and biscuits (Chick-Fil-A doesn't have fried chicken and their biscuits aren't as good as Bojangles).  The chicken was a little spicier than I expected.  I had worked for Popeye's in a previous life and I am fairly used to spicy.  But the Bojangles spicy is different.  It's not hot, it just packs a punch.  I liked it a lot.  My wife, however was not impressed and she reminded me of her opinion for the rest of the day.  I was especially happy to try their biscuits.  I had heard great things and I am biscuit freak.    Bojangles does not disappoint.  As far as everything is concerned, the restaurant was clean, their service was especially friendly; when we came back for the 8-piece later in the day, the drive-through person was uber-excited and put a smile on our faces: Makes a difference when someone is happy when they talk.    I give the service a 5; price a 4; location a 5; being open on Sundays a 5; and breakfast all day long a 5.  Their chicken had a great taste, but I'm not totally sold on the fried chicke itself.  The legs they gave me were the size of my thumbs and it just wasn;t as crispy as I generally like.  I'd  have to say I like Harris Teeter fried Chicken just a little bit more than Bojangles.  However, I love their sandwiches and breakfast slection emensly.  I give them a 3.5 for fried chicken.    Overall, I am giving them 4-stars."}
{"text":"What is really going on with fast food? Especially this location...  I can't believe  the service here in the evening... My God, so unprofessional I came through drive-thru once I reached the window the cashier was very rude... chewing gum, didn't even greet me, didn't say thank you, didn't offer any condiments I had to ask for them which is fine but it needs to be another sense of urgency that we do when we're taking care of customers. I spend a lot of money at Bojangles and I am very appalled of the service that I receive tonight,this will be my last trip to Bojangles at this location I'm very unhappy with the service. And to top it off...I  had to bring the food back fries was old and the chicken was hard....I REALLY hope that the management team comes together and work on the staff here. Every fast food restaurant can take a page out of Chick-fil-A book in orientation so we can see how we need to be professional when taking care of  customers thank you"}
{"text":"It's a fairly new vicinity and I had the opportunity to visit this place for  breakfast. I was on my way to play ball on Saturday morning and I didn't have time to make myself a breakfast in the morning so I decided to stop by to get me some energy. My coffee, egg & cheese biscuit and bo rounds came out fresh. It's very neat and clean place, there service is good and food is fresh and tasty. My friend ordered their sweet tea which was so good I had to get one myself on the go.  I usually visit Bojangles whenever I am craving for bo rounds but this location stood out of all I have visited so far."}
{"text":"The service is sooo slow, especially in the drive through. Customer service could so be better, but the actual food is just as good as any other Bojangles."}
{"text":"Saltiest ham, egg and cheese biscuit I've ever had. I can feel my blood pressure rising. Coffee was pretty lousy too. The potato rounds were ok."}
{"text":"5 stars because Bojangles biscuits are delicious. This is an airport Bojangles so it's a litttle bit more expensive but its worth it if you're in the B terminal. It's also relatively cheap compared to other places in the airport. I mean come on what are you going to get a bag of beef jerkey from Hudson News and a soggy turkey sandwich out of some fridge???? No. Don't do that to yourself. Just get some chicken'n Biscuits and start your diet tomorrow when you're done jet setting."}
{"text":"Worst Bojangles' in town. They should honestly be ashamed. The worst employee there is by far the guy with the ponytail on top of his head. He consistently gets orders wrong and is always rude. Do not go to this Bojangles'."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain and housed inside an international airport, but I don't care. Forget KFC and even Popeye's. Bojangles fried chicken tops them all. How can you beat a perfectly breaded and fried cajun filet biscuit? Answer: You can't!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty selective when it comes to my food, especially things that seem so easy to make. However when it comes to Bojangles and their biscuits, chicken, and grits; I'm always satisfied. The one thing I look forward to at this airport is this food spot. Since I'm not fortunate enough to have a location close to home, each time I've ever traveled through here...I stop here, even if I'm on the opposite side of the airport. So delicious each and everytime. Get your food to go and eat it on your plane ride; you'll be the envy of all the other passengers."}
{"text":"Service if horrible will not go back.  Last three visits were not good slow service and long wait as food was not on line,  Last visit food was cooked but received not what was ordered,  The girl getting our order together told me \" that was what I ordered and paid for\"  I kindly told her we had ordered something different and she started to get snippy with me telling me it was what we ordered.  The older lady working beside her changed my order to what it should be without saying anything .  The girl kept saying they got what they ordered loudly.  I asked to speak to the manager and the older lady said \" I am  her manager \"  With that I asked why she would let her speak to a paying customer that way.  Manager had not response.  I will not go back to this Bojangles again.  * ONLY GIVING 1 STAR BECAUSE I CAN'T LEAVE 0 STAR."}
{"text":"Been in driver thru over 25 minutes!!! Was asked did I want to pay cash or credit only to then be told we can only take cash. Is this for real on football Sunday. Get it together I'm missing kickoff due to my \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Look I like Bojangles but not in an airport setting!  Seriously no one needs to eat like that and then jump on a plane, you deserver better!"}
{"text":"Waited several minutes before somebody walked to the counter and asked what I wanted. Nor was I greeted or thanked. The food was fast food and I will understand that. Lack of service? I don't get why?? Nor will I accept that."}
{"text":"This is a staple fast-food restaurant in the south.  Why do they not have it up north you might ask?  Well, people just cook better biscuits and gravy down here, even when it is fast food.  I like this location, because they put soul into their food, whereas in the upperclass neighborhoods, I have noticed that the Bojangles are not very great quality.  The biscuits aren't fresh and the eggs aren't cooked right.  The biscuits here are always the perfect balance between crunchy and thick.  I love their sweet tea too, it is so sweet and only ninety-nine cents for a carton.  Bojangles for life, baby."}
{"text":"Food was more fresh here than at other locations I've been to. May have just been the timing, but I could tell all of the food (biscuits, fries, sides, etc.) hadn't been sitting long."}
{"text":"Be warned.  This is gateway Bojangles.  It can lead to full-scale Bojangles addiction.  I fly USAIRWAYS rather than Delta to get to this, the first Bojangles I can get to on the way home, anticipating, hoping, to deboard at or depart from gates B9 -12, so as to have enough time to experience Bojanglification (Music, there should be music:  Harps.  And angels.  Angels making that holy \"Ahhhh\" sound).    Nobody's claiming it's health food, but it is the absolute best chain southern fried chicken, and holds its own among any I've tried, at any price, anywhere.  The unhealthiest part, the battered, fatty skin, is of course, the absolute best. uniformly, consistently crispy, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of their proprietary Cajun seasoning, with just a touch of heat (maybe a touch less than there used to be?), and the meat juicy, moist, and flavorful to the bone.  The fresh biscuits, for which I think them equally well-known, while not particularly \"flaky\", are light and fluffy, and generally delicious on their own, the combination perfectly complimented by the (usually) perfectly brewed sweet tea, uncontaminated by unnecessary additions of such as raspberry or peach flavor, and usually just perfectly, and not overly sweet, to the Southern tongue at least (though would not be enough to my SC housemate).    I have tried most, if not all of the breakfast biscuits, and love them as well, but can understand some folk's shock at the saltiness of the ham biscuit, but note it is (correctly) billed as \"country ham\", as opposed to I guess \"city ham\", of the deli meats/sandwich slice variety, softer, and far less briny, but Bojangles' is true to the country ham tradition, so be warned, and keep the BP meds handy.  The Bo-Berry biscuits are an icing covered sugary mess to eat, and absolutely delicious when warm, but one is sufficient, or a tad more than, and should not be consumed by the diabetic except in immediate anticipation of administration of last rites or at least loss of consciousness.  I'm not sure the Bo-Berries are quite worth the sugar overdose, but the chicken is worth every juicy, delectably, deliciously, nose-opening, olfactory and salivary stimulating calorie and milligram of sodium - at least once in a while.        While it's not all been perfect every single time I've been through, it's been so remarkably, consistently excellent at this small, extremely high-traffic outpost on so many separate occasions, that I can't fault them for the one time or two time \"off-tasting\" teas or not quite up to their usual near-beatific peak on every occasion, and the prices aren't bad for an airport location.  I'm pretty stingy with that 5th star and in the face of the mournful opprobrium of the Yelp masses generally don't even consider it for fast food and chain restaurants, but in this case, I think it's warranted, so you can take that drum stick and eat it (and thank me later)."}
{"text":"They are so polite here and always give me extra honey mustard. I've never had a problem with any of the staff and I really have enjoyed each experience at this location!"}
{"text":"Chicken and biscuit were stale and dried yet terribly greasy. The grease wasn't yummy fat goodness but rather cold, solidified trans fat horror. Yuck! Between Bojangles and Brookwood Farms BBQ at the Charlotte Airport besides a nose-blowing employee at a Starbucks there, Charlotte has left an awful impression on this traveler."}
{"text":"Half the time I come here there is an inexplicable 15-20 minute wait at the drive through. Or it's closed completely for some unknown reason. The food is usually ok though. They desperately need new management."}
{"text":"So we had a layover in Charlotte,NC on our way to Jamaica. About two hours just enough time to get to the next terminal, Because this place is packed. In the sea of people rushing to their next flight, I see a Familiar red and white bag in a gentleman's hand. The first thing that came to my mind was Bojangles. And while the Colonel ran \"Bo\" out of Kentucky, I still hold a special place in my belly for Mr Bojangles. What you find here is what you expect, fast, hot and fresh. Almost forget to mention good. Service is quick, not sure if the person was friendly, because i couldn't understand what she said. I think she said, may I make you over, so I just Gave her my order and my food somehow found it's way into my hand. Love that red and yellow sign"}
{"text":"Goes with out saying get the Cajun fillet biscuit and BO rounds. They've done me right many a time at this location. Service and food is solid, but you can expect a pretty long wait most Saturday and Sunday mornings between 9:30a-12:00p."}
{"text":"Oh I'm glad I flew through Charlotte. I never get Bo unless I'm in the south. Or at union station in DC. What a wonderful surprise.   Cajun chicken fillet on the best biscuit. Larger biscuit than most places. Blows away Popeyes biscuits. KFC biscuits don't even come close.   Wish we had Bojangles in New York. Sigh."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Went by the drive thru today just to wait 10 minutes for someone to get my order & then after that had to repeat my order 4 times due to the person at the window not listen (& I know this because they would be talking to someone else) I ended up just leaving.  Last week I also saw two employees arguing at the drive thru window while I waited for my change back. The food is still good but the customer service is horrible enough that I live in the area & rather travel to Huntersville for some Bojangles."}
{"text":"This location had nice workers with fast, great service only problem was I got my food from the drive thru and unfortunately my food was cold and I was not really happy about it! My sausage biscuit looked and tasted like it was sitting out for a while and it was not fresh. On the other hand the bo-rounds were good and hot!"}
{"text":"Well I pulled into this Bojangles to grab food before the bridal expo. I was super excited because they had flags everywhere that read \"Grand Opening\". I knew this wasn't a new location because it's been here for year. I saw no upgrades, changes, or new paint. So I wasn't sure exactly what they were celebrating lol.  As I pulled around after ordering my food I looked in the window and their food score was a 91.5. That's not good especially if it's a \"Grand Opening\". Someone's lying somewhere and giving out false hope!"}
{"text":"So I stopped over here with my wife for a connecting flight and wanted to try something new that was not located anywhere on the westcoast. Right next to our gate was this RED and YELLOW sign that said BOJANGLES. So we checked it out... it was worth it.  This is what I would get there:  The Dirty Rice (A good mixture of dirt and rice together)  The Chicken (Lightly salted with a crispy outterlayer that will knock your cock off)   Sweet Tea (surprisingly refreshing and tasty... not like that nestea crap)  The Famous Pie (I think they put crack in them with some sweet potato... they were really good and that's coming from someone that HATES sweet potato).  Enjoy it when you're in the airport waiting for your delayed flight or when you're connecting.  Like Pitbull... JIG-GY JIG-GY... JIG-GY JIG-GY... BOJANGLES... THE FOLLOWING IS NOT A TEST DJ."}
{"text":"Probably should've read the reviews before coming here but hey I wanted Bojangles and it was around the way where I was going. I got quite a laugh at the note on the intercom. The drive-through didn't take long and the personnel in the drive-through seemed very friendly calling me honey, baby, sugar, sweetie,  etc. each time I said something. The food is where they lost majority of their stars. The taste was way off.  I'm expecting a fresh buttered biscuit and a delicious crispy chicken in between. Instead I got a stale biscuit and chicken it tasted super funny so I didn't end up eating the sandwich and just ran to the Chick-fil-A nearby since I was so hungry. I always trust my gut with food if it doesn't taste right on the first bite something is off don't eat it. Rather than getting sick I decided to venture on I won't return to this Bojangles and skip it if you can."}
{"text":"This location is great for people watching. Came here after the wine fest because I needed something heavy. The food as hot and fresh same as any other chain bojangles, but the staff and customers were hilarious. Never saw a person pay for with a money order before made out to the exact amount of the meal box. Staff were friendly and I got some great laughs at all the adventures I saw. The took a while to get some food so maybe skip this place if your in a hurry. Overall food and place were good."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure fast food doesn't get better than this.    And when every thing on the menu starts with 'famous', at ANY OTHER restaurant, you should question it.  But not here.  Their famous sweet tea rocks;  their famous sweet potato pie rocks; their famous chicken and biscuits rocks.    I almost brought some to come with me on the plane."}
{"text":"I Am an absolute lover of Bojangles but this location service and food were absolutely terrible. If it was my first Bojangles experience I would never be back. I went through the drive thru and they were busy understandably on a Sunday morning but it took 30 minutes before I got to the pickup window. Once I was in line I saw how slow it was moving but couldn't leave because of the drive thru line barrier. I accepted my faith. Each car was at the pickup window for 1-5 minutes each. This is fast food... why is it taking so long for every single car/ order? Finally got my food 30 minutes later and I ordered sausage egg and cheese biscuit with borounds. Borounds were good. The sausage egg and cheese biscuit was disgusting. My food was clearly made 15 minutes ago when I ordered and was just sitting there. The biscuit was so HARD it crumbled and crunched when bitten into. My biscuit was sitting there so long that the cheese turned orange and was hard. This location does not live up to any Bojangles standards. Absolute Bojangles lover but this location and customers would be better off if it was shit down."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a place where the customers are an afterthought, then this is the place for you. The customer in front of me was still waiting on his food as I finished my meal. The employees were too involved in their conversations with each other about what happened last night, instead of engaging with the customer. The employee on the register had earbuds in his ears so he couldn't hear what you ordered. The floors were a mess and so were the tables."}
{"text":"When I got to the cash register to place my order, the cashier walked away and washed her hands never to return to take my order. The young lady who did take my order was friendly. However the lady who initially walked away ended up being on food detail and gave me the wrong food. Never have I had breakfast at bojangles before and it's fine. Nothing special at all."}
{"text":"This Bojangles location is the worst one I've experienced with. I've waited in line for 30 minutes to receive cold chicken with a long strand of hair in it. Asked for hot sauce, left with no hot sauce. Asked for lemonade, left with sweet tea. This was the 8 piece tailgate special by the way. Good luck everyone. Never going back."}
{"text":"Bojangles is a chicken sandwich chain that I had never tried nor heard of prior to today. I had a $12 voucher from American Airlines because they delayed my flight and I subsequently had a nine hour layover. I decided to spend the $12 on a cherry Gatorade and chicken supreme salad. I was tempted to get their breakfast biscuits (breakfast served all day) but steered clear when I saw the calorie content was almost my entire day's worth of calories. I opted for the \"healthier\" option of lettuce, tomato, carrots, cheese and freshly fried chicken. The wait was longer for the salad than all the breakfast sandwiches because of the chicken. It was worth the wait because it was delicious. I got the honey mustard dressing. The chicken was hot, fresh, crispy, nicely seasoned and mighty yummy. This spot is in terminal b. The salad was super filling and good enough for one big appetite or two smaller ones. There's a large eating area to the right of the shop. The cashier woman was friendly and joked around with me."}
{"text":"Decided to try out some chicken and biscuits when flying through the airport here. Damn good stuff NC, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I just got back from Bojangles and am pretty disappointed.  First I ordered my food and they \"forgot\" to mention they have no more thighs until I already paid. So they tried to replace it with 1 wing, seriously? I got two out if them but still that is ridiculous. Then I got the food and checked it, my boyfriend got a 3 piece meal and they only put one one leg and their last thigh, they forgot the third piece....how does a fried chicken restaurant not have thighs and forget food? I am disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was the first time I had bojangles chicken and it was amazing. The skin was crispy with the perfect juiciness and large portions with the perfect batter.  The airport bojangles was great to have available but it was a little far from the main terminal intersections. So it was a little bit of a mission to get to from other gates.  However, the service was fast and quick and despite being in the airport, the prices was still super quick! If I'm ever in the Charlotte airport again, this is the first pit stop for me unless I'm running late for my flight!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats Southern Fried chicken and Bojangles gets it pretty spot on. There's something about the chicken being marinated in hot-sauce and then fried that makes it really good.  This is a chain restaurant, so quality is similar to other Bojangles. However, the manager at this location was super friendly. When we ordered our food we shared that we were visiting from out of town. While we were enjoying our meal, he brought over some cinnamon twist treats on the house.  I love that southern hospitality."}
{"text":"How do you always run out of green beans. How do you run out of the most common sides all the time.  Oh. And that one container is what you put ketchup in. Not a side. Total rip off."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome after the renovation! Everything is new and modern and has a clean look to it. There's a drive through that looks easy to use, but I was making a large order, so I went in. The lady at the register was very welcoming and quickly took my order of a dozen bo-berry biscuits. The wait was a little longer than I'd hoped, but it could be because the biscuits were fresh out of the oven, which smelled sooooo good in my car. It was torture not to eat them until I got to work. The manager who handed me my order wasn't quite as friendly. While I was waiting, she had kindly asked me to move so that she could get to the soda machine, but she also didn't say any sort of greeting or anything when I smiled at her. Overall a fine experience and of course the biscuits themselves are dank."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Bojangles, so when I had a layover at the airport, I had to stop by. I ordered the 3 piece dinner (1 drum, 2 thighs) with mashed potatoes, which also came with a biscuit. They were out of dark meat, so I waited about 12 minutes for them to make a new batch because I don't believe in white meat fried chicken =). It was defintely worth the wait! Fresh out of the fryer, the skin was perfectly crispy, and the chicken was nice and moist. The mashed potatoes and biscuits were pretty standard for a fast food friend chicken place, but definitely still satisfying. I'm glad I walked to the next terminal over to eat here!"}
{"text":"Two stars because it's a chain and they serve my favorite stuff but THEIR DRIVE THRU LINE TAKES YEARS TO GO THROUGH (Even if they're slow and it's not the lunch rush) but god forbid you go on the lunch rush like I did as I'm sitting here waiting for my food I've been waiting in this line for 20 minutes.   They need to get a manager hired that fixes how terrible their drive thru line is."}
{"text":"Knowing that I had a layover in Charlotte, NC, and knowing that there was a Bojangles in the airport I just had to look up the location (end of Terminal B) so that I could run over during my short layover. I waited in a speedy line, but when I got to the front I realized it was fast because the cashier was very short with me, bordering on rude, and not helpful. I ordered a Cajon Filet Biscuit, fries, sweet tea, and a bo-berry biscuit. I was quickly shuffled down the line to wait for my food. A number similar to mine was immediately called, and someone else at the front of the line immediately grabbed it and walked away. I waited wondering when my food would be ready; at this point, I thought it was a normal wait because numbers before mine were still being called. Five minutes later, the gentleman that took the order before me came back to the counter stating that what he received/took was not his order. I then come to find out that it was MY order. A supervisor was nearby, and offered to make me a new sandwich. No one offered me a new sweet tea or bo-berry biscuit. I asked the server for a new sweet tea, and he obliged me. The supervisor returned with my sandwich and forgot the fries, but then quickly remembered and added them.  No one offered me a new bo-berry biscuit. I don't understand why the supervisor didn't offer to replace everything, considering a random person walked away with my food and was in possession of it for roughly five minutes. I don't understand why I had to specifically ask for a new sweet tea. I didn't ask for a few bo-berry biscuit, and it was never offered to me. That's just ridiculous, who thinks it ok to essentially get \"used\" food. They didn't even open the box to check that it wasn't obviously contaminated.  I didn't bother arguing with the service members because clearly they don't value customer service or cleanliness. To round out this horrible experience, after hustling to my flight in Terminal D, I sit down to find that the new sandwich I was given was a Cajun Filet Sandwich, which was almost flavorless with not a single hint of cajun flavor, and not a Cajon Filet Biscuit. I didn't come all this way for a bun. I came for the biscuit. The service and food at Bojangles really disappointed me. I will not recommend any Bojangles branch to anyone until my concerns are addressed.   And to top it off, the contact feature on there website limits you to ~500 characters so that I wasn't able to submit a moderately detailed description of what happened."}
{"text":"At least the customer service was friendly, but came home to find small fries instead of the large I paid for, no sauce at all eventhough I asked twice and it was repeated back to me and when did the Chicken Supremes become Cajun style? So hot I could barely eat them."}
{"text":"Awful service, slow, biscuit was under cooked. Had we drove off when the window gave us our food, we would have not had our drinks, spoons, or straws... when we ordered they made us repeat it three time, and then decided what we were gonna get beCause it  made it \"cheaper\" when they charged us for for two fries we didn't want. They didn't have borounds... my drink had no ice in it."}
{"text":"The worst, literally no one there has a single idea of how fast food is suppose to flow. Nor do they know how to work a machine. Got charged for a combo and an extra drink and ended up not getting either. Worries me that this place is a \"safe place\" can't imagine anyone there knows the protocol for that either."}
{"text":"The worst. Waited 15 minutes -left without food. Lamest"}
{"text":"When you go in service is great! But drive thru is always slow and speaker hasn't worked good in 4 years!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst Bojangles I've ever been to. I wasn't even greeted for one when I grabbed in the bag for my fries they were hard as a rock and when I bit into one I almost cracked my tooth. Oh and I wasn't given a receipt but I'll still be calling corporate"}
{"text":"Nice people. Bo rounds were fresh af (I was told it would be a 4 minute wait for them, but overall they have fast service.) The biscuit on the Cajun filet biscuit was the best biscuit I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is good. I've always loved bojangles. But there's always a long line here because there's nothing in the \"fast food\" category close by. Even with waiting forever in line the employees aren't very friendly. It's like pulling teeth to just get a simple \"hello\" from someone."}
{"text":"Okay so I normally don't review fast food places because I think it's pointless but i had to write one for this place. I've been to this Bojangles probably 10 or more times but they ALWAYS get the order wrong. I mean how do you screw up a butter biscuit? And they're always extremely rude. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"Fast and good service. Big pieces of chicken.  A good chicken joint..better than KFC and Popeyes."}
{"text":"First off I must say when it comes to fast food breakfast the Cajun Filet biscuit is the ticket.  Get a side of Cajun fries or some hash browns. No order is complete without a cheerwine or even better go with a large Bojangles sweet tea. That's how NC does. It.   However, the last couple of visits at this location have been missing something. By missing something on one visit I thought I would go with a bacon egg cheese biscuit and was told they did not have egg . What? So the next visit asked for a pork chop biscuit as the sign out from advertised. Guess what / they did not have any pork chop biscuits. Ended up not getting anything. Maybe it's a sign I shouldn't eat fast food or maybe it's a sign I stick to the Cajun filet biscuit at this location at least ."}
{"text":"Management need to step in fast, this place sucks on customer service. They treat you so ghetto."}
{"text":"Listen, I absolutely love Bojangles and it's probably one of my favorite places to eat. I eat out at Bojangles almost every week. The food is amazing. But the reason I'm rating this specific Bojangles 1 star is because of how disgusting it was. This is my hometown Bojangles so I've been here plenty of times to know what it's like. It was terribly dirty and horribly maintained. The last time I went there (recently) there was a massive water puddle under the drink machine and spilling out onto the carpet allowing only one dry table open. When I went up and ordered my food the kid working at the counter didn't even know I came in the building because he was so distracted with his phone. When I got his attention he was half asleep and when he gave me my food it had an odd odor to it. I'm not a nit picky clean person but this definitely ticked me off. Another recent time I went there and asked them to butter the biscuit and they gave it to me and told me to butter my own biscuit. Is it really that hard to do? The only reason I'm going to return is if to see if they've improved any. I wish Bojangles would shut down this location, it is an absolute disgrace to the Bojangles franchise. Would much rather go to any restaurant in all of Waxhaw than to go here. Do not waste your money on this place. I hope they shut down and build something worth being in Waxhaw. It's a disgrace to the town as well because they have several restaurants named one of the best and cleanest in all of North Carolina. Another time we went there was on Halloween and the lady working was likely drunk or high on something. She was falling over everywhere and when we asked for extra sauce she literally grabbed every single sauce packet in the building and filled our bag with them."}
{"text":"Have had SEVERAL issues with this particular location. The staff and management are rude. The food just tastes old and unseasoned. However, that seems to be the theme with all Bojangles restaurants these days. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bad customer - period. Yelling at us through the drive through.  Ordered a Cajun fillet biscuit , two legs snack pack and an order if Cajun season fries and cannot forget the cheerwine. We were told it would be a 4.5 minute wait for Cajun fillet biscuit, ok, we were ok with that. We drove to Bojangles specifically for that. Otherwise we could have gone to a closer fried chicken establishment.  Pay for the order, no receipt given. Then we are handed our food and no sandwich.  So we wait for the cashier to come back and he said we never said we wanted to wait. And if we wanted it, he would have to charge us for it. Wow- no kidding. We said forget about it.  No way are we paying for more bad service.  Drive away and take a sip of our colored seltzer water- cheerwine fountain drink needs it's syrup box changed. It's just not run very well- training needs to be done again for the drive through and possible on how to do their daily tasks to ensure when customers order- they actually get what they paid for. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"They charged me for multiple items that I asked for and never gave them to me I went and complained to the manager who was an old racist white man who would not refund my money or give me the items I ordered"}
{"text":"Alright y'all.   The fried turkeys are done in advance and you pick it up cold to thaw and then pop in the oven.   I don't like to reheat anything that was once fried. I'm beyond disappointed.  $39.95 before tax. Order and pay in advance."}
{"text":"I just went to the drive thru and they said that they were throwing all of the food away and they would not serve me even though the drive thru closes 1 hour from now. Very Rude and not polite about it at all."}
{"text":"Awful, Horrible service, fries and biscuits were well under cooked. After going through the drive through we didn't receive an order of fries, napkins, straws, or a BEC biscuit we ordered. Went inside to get them, came back out and had a long black hair in my biscuit. Went back inside to have them make another one and one of the employees thought it was funny and proceeded to laugh and mock us. Very unprofessional but they obviously don't care. Can't even make a biscuit right."}
{"text":"I walked the length of 2 terminals to get to Bojangles. And after staring at the menu I ordered the 3 piece meal and the fries side. For $1 I added the ice tea. All's well so far. Then I take a bite of the chicken. It's steaming hot and the skin is crispy, but after the second or third bite I start to gulp the iced tea. The chicken is super salty. And I still had 2.5 pieces to get through...I'm not wasting it! To help make it more edible I grabbed done hot sauce and dunked the chicken in.  After all the effort, I was full, but not satisfied. I think I should've just stuck to the open-faced European-style sandwiches at Beadeuvin in the Central Terminal. That's a classy, healthy spot in this airport. Someone needs to tell the chef that salt in NOT in fashion anymore! Can't believe this is the same place I gave 4-stars to in 2008!"}
{"text":"3 Stars  Had a layover in Charlotte, and I was starving, so I figured I'd try something new instead of the same restaurants and fast food joints we have here in CA....so I ended up here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Un0QXKDscxlI_yi3u14ALA?select=cnXwHNVzwdkFr05os2Px3w  Service was good, but what made it entertaining was the fact that the girl taking my order had such a deep accent southern accent that I couldn't understand what she was saying!!!!  Ended up ordering a lot: 4 Piece Supremes Combo  - the Chicken was good (3 1/2 stars), I could pass on the Ranch dressing next time, but the BBQ sauce was good (tasted a little like KFC's)  - the Biscuit was good (3 stars), but not even close to KFC's  - Seasoned fries were good too (3 stars), but I don't like too much seasoning on my fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Un0QXKDscxlI_yi3u14ALA?select=lSYZdhA-CJYewgqT7n4HBg  Mashed Potatoes and Gravy were pretty good (3 1/2 stars), so was the Dirty Rice (3 1/2 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Un0QXKDscxlI_yi3u14ALA?select=XrKB34L4q47qkeChLbeFgA  Instead of a soda, they let me just get a bottle of water for my drink....some places don't http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Un0QXKDscxlI_yi3u14ALA?select=WUouruw-29_taYCHFrlzBw"}
{"text":"Drive thru too damn slow! After one car leave then they take your order. It's the morning rush and ppl are trying to get breakfast and get to work. I have more grease in my sandwich wrapper than it took to cook the food! It's not appealing at all and the eggs smell just like grease."}
{"text":"How did Bo Jangles' get 3.5 stars??    Melly Mel and I ordered: 4 Piece Supreme Snack (comes with a biscuit, no drink) 4 Piece Supreme Combo (comes with a biscuit, a side, AND drink)  Well, we got fries with both orders (no one is going to complain about that!), but we asked for honey mustard with one order, and ranch with the other.  We only got honey mustard.  They were nice enough to give me some ranch sauce without charging me extra for it.  Now comes to the chicken - it sucks.  It's dry and flavorless, and to top it off, these pieces are small.....I mean, really small.  Imagine 2 Chicken McNuggets stacked side by side, that's the size of 1 piece @ Bo Jangles'.  And the prices!!  For what we ordered, we paid $15.  Not worth it.    I hope people in the south have Popeye's....b/c Bo Jangles' ain't cuttin' it....he should probably stick to tap dancing b/c chicken ain't his thang...."}
{"text":"Look, there's nothing healthy for you at Bojangles--or nothing you'd order, at least. You know that going on. You're probably going to feel a little sick or regretful after your meal. You know that going in, too. But still, this place makes the tastiest, worst food. I can't help but go back time and time again, even if it's just to reward myself for good behavior.   There's a lot to love about Bojangles, this location in particular. As you'd expect, this location is super clean and, well, pretty fast; you get your food in a timely fashion, which makes the crowds less intimidating. The fries are to die for: supremely seasoned and pipin' hot. My girlfriend lives and dies by Bojangles biscuits, so be sure to grab one if you can. While their chicken sandwiches are awesome, I love their tenders too; I often combine these with a meal of mashed potatoes and/or slaw.   Again, probably the least healthy option in the world, but as far as fast food--what a tasty option."}
{"text":"That cajun chicken biscuit is sooooo good.  Best chain fried chicken I've ever had."}
{"text":"Terrible...2nd time I visited this location to make sure it wasn't just bad timing. Nope it's the location!   Terrible service and don't go after 930.   I was told they drop their last chicken batch at 9 and after they sell out they go to some late night menu that doesn't include chicken. Lmao...A chicken spot that don't sell chicken...I'm done!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe how slow the service is and how nasty the people are.  They need to adopt the chick-fil-a model."}
{"text":"The wait was long. The service wasn't with a smile. The Cheddar Bo with cajun chicken added made it all better."}
{"text":"I was brought here on a recent family visit. My fam had just moved to Charlotte and have become enamored w/this place and told use we had to \"have a taste of the South\". If the South tastes like overcooked day old fried chicken, then I will continue to partake in consuming fare that was influenced above the Mason-Dixie line.  So yeah...the chicken tender meal I got was not great. The chicken was dry, the breading was pretty awful and had no flavor (maybe I should have gotten the \"spicy\" option?) and the biscuit was hard and dry (I think their biscuits moonlight as hockey pucks).   The mac n cheese was on par w/KFC, so not terrible, but not amazing.  The only thing this place managed to get right was the sweet tea, but if they could not get sweet tea right this far south, then their \"Southerner\" badge would have officially been revoked.  I had expressed my meal dismay to my family and they agreed it was \"an off day\". I advised them I did not want to put in the gastronomical research to prove them right or wrong and considered my visit here a \"one and done\" tourist from Texas experience."}
{"text":"Had been here in a long time and it was ok, but not that special in the chicken department.  Just got a breast with fries and a biscuit.  Liked the large biscuit and the fries seasoning was nice.  Chicken was somewhat boring spiced vs. a KFC or Popeye's.  Of course, in the airport, cost more than it was worth but still better than the vending machine garbage sandwich American would sell you for your flight."}
{"text":"I live 7 minutes down the street from this Bojangles when we got home I checked my food none of the chicken was hot it looks like it's been sitting in a puddle of grease. The only thing positive from our Meals was the dirty rice and drinks. I tried to call and explain what happened and that I was not happy with my meals the manager on duty decided she wanted to argue with me instead of fixing the issue. She stated that the chicken was fresh and just came out of the fryer I find that very hard to believe. This is not the 1st time I've had issues with this particular Bojangles but it's safe to say that I will not spend any more of my money at this branch."}
{"text":"Worst bojangles...employees so rude...food always cold...save your money and calories...DONT COME HERE"}
{"text":"Thank sweet baby jesus my flight left from gate b9 living in LA we don't get the amazingness of bojangles... my backpack is now full of biscuits"}
{"text":"This location is at the airport. The lines are long, but very fast service. From a line of about 20 people, I was able to wait in line, order, and get my meal in less than three minutes."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 minutes for an order of a tailgate special, only gave us 6 pieces instead of 8, gave us white meat when we asked for dark meat, and paying took 5 minutes. .just really poor service."}
{"text":"Sorry Boj... going to down you a star... ever since you got that new guy working the front things haven't really been the same.  I waited a long time for by biscuit this morning behind 3 other people while the workers hurriedly made a huge order of sausage biscuits (2 boxes worth) I counted 30 [yes I was waiting for that whole order to go through so I had time to count along with the employees].  I'm sure the new guy will just need some time to adjust, but he seems pretty lost, especially when people ask him for extra sauce (jam, butter, salt/pepper).  I think I got used to the usual morning crew so much so that it is a little sad to me that things were switched up.  I am probably just getting old and \"like my routine\" the way it is, but hopefully the new guy will get up to par pretty soon."}
{"text":"Sorry closest Bojangles to me, I think there's a reason why I don't frequent you often.  I did come by here the other day and sat in the drive through for entirely way too long, only to pull up and find out that my drink order was messed up.  I did get to keep the pink lemonade HI-C that I didn't want in the first place, but I think I would have traded anything else for that experience of waiting and starting at the strange algae-ed pools of water that is located behind the location.  I know there is a time and place for Boj's but if the convenience of the drive-thru is not even a strong point in your services, I think I would much rather walk to another establishment and get served in the same time it took to receive my meal the other day.  This location is super busy, but the way the drive through is set up to handle a lot of cars in the queue... is probably not a good sign since you will spend a lot of time just sitting there...."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I grew up in Northern Virginia so technically I would be a \"Yankee\"  We did not have the pleasure of Bojangles up where I grew up, but I think it's slowly starting to make its way into VA.  Popeye's was my absolute favorite (and still is in some respects) but livin' in the south, I gotta give props to Boj's.    Unfortunately I've put myself on a diet, but I really really do enjoy Bojangles when I do get it - when people from out of town come in.  It's a great excuse to get some good chicken, biscuits, and sides.  This location is off Independence Blvd.  Unfortunately you can't get to it easily when you are traveling East - just make a U-turn and you are good, but getting back out (if you want to continue East) can be a little tricky.  Other than the logistics, the chicken is great... the staff is always friendly... and the place well kept."}
{"text":"Great location... newly renovated and kept clean.   The dining room also has pictures of old buildings (that I am assuming) are buildings that used to be around the midtown area.  Biscuits + Chicken + convenient to Uptown = awesome."}
{"text":"I always look forward to having Bojangles.  Maybe the secret is having it only once in a while so that you don't get sick of eating it.  Came here not to eat, but to pick up my race packet for the annual Turkey Trot.  This Bojangles has an upstairs area that can be used.. I've only seen The Charlotte Running company use it for their Turkey Trots, but I'm sure they use it for other things.  The dining room here looks ginormous... I definitely need to try to eat here the next time I'm around."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Bojangles is the breakfast biscuits.  Usually I go for Sausage egg and cheese or replace the sausage with bacon which is what I did today.  You normally can't go wrong with Bo's biscuits but today my biscuit was crunchy meaning it was cooked a little to long or it sat under a heat lamp.  The bacon was flavorful and very smoky - an absolutely wonderful flavor which melded with the rest of the sandwich.   While the sandwich tasted good, other than the crunchy biscuit, it was not put together well.  The cheese was halfway off the sandwich.  I love Bo's.  It's definitely my favorite fast food breakfast place and this isn't going to stop me from going back.  Hopefully my next sandwich will be better."}
{"text":"This gets five stars for being the best airport fast food location ever. I diverted my red eye from New York to Fort Myers (Spring Training yea!) just so I could get breakfast here. I always thought that you could make a whole restaurant around selling KFC biscuits, and it turns out they already have! Except, Bojangles biscuits are better! Flaky, coronary artery disease inducingly butter, just the right kind of meal to alleviate a morning hangover and then put you right back into a food coma as you step onto the plane. While the biscuit sandwiches are the easiest on the go, you must do the white gravy and sausage if you have a few seconds to stop and smell the gravy."}
{"text":"Slightly less than 3.5. I had a short layover, so I looked for something relatively quick. I didn't seek out a deep fried option, but Bojangle's was near my gate and there was no one in line...what the heck. I ordered a Cajun chicken sandwich (served in a buttery biscuit) with a side of dirty rice, and it was surprisingly good! Pepsi is the beverage supplier, in case you're partial to Coke. Yes, a little greasy, but flavorful nonetheless."}
{"text":"I don't eat Bojangles often, but when I do, I come to this location.  Apparently it's been renovated in the last year or two, and it's very clean and well-kept.  The employees are hit or miss, as sometimes we've had great, friendly service and other times they've gotten our order wrong or been too busy talking to each other.  Typical fast food customer service in that regard.  I've been to other Bojangles locations though, and this one blows them out of the water.  This place was our intro to southern-fast-food when we moved here, and it will always hold a special place in my now-heart-diseased heart.  Thanks Bojangles."}
{"text":"There's not too many options available in the Charlotte Convention Centre food court and I saw a lot of people eating out of these red and yellow boxes so I thought I should try it.  It lives up to its word - awesome fried chicken and biscuits. The biscuits were fresh and super fluffy. Make sure you ask for jam to have with them."}
{"text":"This 'Jang is the closest one to my sister's house.  When I can't get my Cook Out fix, I come here (as the locations in Atlanta seem to be diminishing, unless you want to take a 35 minute drive).  I remember the first time I was here, there was a guy training on the register, and I needed a drink just to take my order. That was a 2 star affair.  They were open on the morning of Thanksgiving, you better believe I got my fix here!  And damn was it good!  With the exception of the potentially hard to get in and out of, this seems to be a newer location.  However, the dining area is somewhat small.  The people here are great, and so are their biscuits- now if they could only transplant this place to ATL!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Popeye's fan so I like my fried chicken crispy and a bit spicy. I wasn't disappointed with Bojangles. It's juicy and flavorful. You can also try their special bbq and white sauce. Both are pretty good, but the chicken can stand alone on its own. Their dirty rice with bits of meat and sauce is nice as well. If you are from the north, and happen onto a Bojangles in your travels, try some."}
{"text":"Another trip thru drive up.  Order 1 coke 1 tea...got 2 cokes. Ordered salad with ranch...got no dressing.  They never get it right. They really need to improve"}
{"text":"I swear this is the worse location. The owner operator needs to be heavily involved. The owner I doubt is generating a profit. They stop cooking at 8 and literally close at 9. I can't wait until this location goes bankrupt and they open a better restaurant."}
{"text":"good chicken in an airport. i personally think its better than kfc. some of the workers didnt know what the hell they were doing but that was ok"}
{"text":"Went to this location to grab a quick lunch before heading back to work and I was very disappointed. I ordered 3 of the 4 piece supremes combos all with sweet tea and two with honey mustard and one with ranch. After waiting to get to the window my payment was taken and I see a staff member place my boxes down and ask the cashier, \"Medium? Right?\" He says \"Yea!\"  This was the first sign I knew something wasn't right. I watch as he makes the rest of my boxes and then proceeds to hand them to me through the window. I asked the cashier, \"These are all large right?\" And he replies, \"Yes, of course.\" I take them and drive away because I have to get back to work. I arrive and work and open the boxes and to my amazement, sarcasm obviously, they are all medium. And with random sauces thrown in, not the ones I asked for. I called them back and told them about their mistake and that I would be coming back to get either a refund or the food that I ordered when I got off work. The only thing the manager had to say was, \"Oh wow! That sucks!\" I agreed and later that night I showed up to get my proper order and a whole new manager said no one wrote down any notes and that he couldn't do anything about it. Highly disappointed and will never be going back."}
{"text":"The first stop in my food journey. Definitely, the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit beats Carl's 2 for $2. Maybe not price wise, but definitely taste wise. I know this place is a CHICKEN and Biscuit place, so I was a fool for not trying the chicken. However, I must say the biscuits were pretty amazing. Soft, buttery, delicious bread. Not a 5-star because of the price (but this was also at an airport, which may explain the price-rise). The portion size is decent.  Oh, and get the sweet tea."}
{"text":"We ordered a 12 piece Supremes dinner box combo and were served 12 pieces of bone in chicken.  Which wouldn't be such a catastrophe if we didn't have a 3 and a 9 year old.  Fine.  A minor inconvenience.  I will call and ask that it be replaced.  I call, I'm put on speakerphone and left there indefinitely.  I call back to hear a busy signal for the next half hour once I return home.  I'm owed the dinner I paid for.  I will update my response if or when anyone cares enough about this to respond since I can't get a hold of anyone otherwise.  I will upload a photo of the receipt alongside our order we received if I can find the upload button. The time and date and what we received is evident in the picture.  UPDATE:  After returning to the store and explaining everything, after a little lip / attitude from the guy at the window, they remade the tenders, biscuits and two mashed potatoes but not my whole order.  Nice of them to at least replace what they did wrong but its kind of foolish for them to act indignant when this is clearly a mistake of the staff.  I won't be back but raised my review to 3 stars for them \"making it right.\""}
{"text":"You want someone to get your order wrong?  Then this place is a must.  They have messed up my last three orders.  They aren't apologetic when I point it out.  When this first started happening I would wait to check my order when I got home.  Big mistake - they sheepishly offer for you to drive all the way back to get what they messed up.  Forget this noise - I would rather have my refund than an opportunity to drive five miles again so you can do something right.  These aren't complicated orders - they incorrectly billed me at one point, didn't include any sauces, and forgot all the biscuits.  Biscuits!  This is Bojangles - you have biscuits and chicken and you forgot half the items!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I'm lied to about everything. If they don't want to make it and are too lazy they will say that the wait is 5,7,10 min.... or when you offer to wait they come back with \"oh sorry we are actually out of that..\"  Out of effing biscuits at Bojangles. It's comical. I live right up the road and though not proud to say as a single mom this is the fastest thing to grab on a late night after sports practices or on the way to school and not once has the service been remotely decent, from the employees, managers or speed. I really wish someone would step in and help this location because they clearly have zero good reviews."}
{"text":"Slowest Bojangles on earth, no joke. I've left their drive thru several times after a 15-20 minute wait WITHOUT even getting to order."}
{"text":"It's been about 20 min, I only have one car in front of me and all I I ordered was 4 piece chicken ... this is not fast food . Really slow service !!"}
{"text":"With little time to get something to eat before my connecting flight - I waited in a line that seemed to move quite quickly.  The staff were all pleasant and the food was as good as Bojangles gets - a bit dried out and a bit over priced, but when you are in a pinch - it's great having them around!"}
{"text":"I love Bojangles but this location is constantly slow and has often got my order wrong.  During my last visit I was asked to pull up and wait for my order.  After ten minutes I walked in and they had forgot I even ordered.  Kitchen was messy and no manager was working."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was severely lacking. The lady in the drive thru had me give my order, then said hang on, then said \"what do you want?\""}
{"text":"Best service, best food of ANY Bojangles I've ever had. The cashier was so kind and welcoming, plus THAT CHICKEN"}
{"text":"This was literally my first time having Bojangles and now I completely understand the hype.  Bojangles is awesome.  My coronary arteries will not be happy that I have discovered the Mecca of good fried chicken, but whatever, I can always graft new ones.  I had the 3-piece combo with cole slaw and mashed potatoes and I was so happy, I tried to eat my friends' leftovers.  My wife's boneless tenders were more dry than my actual chicken meat so I would recommend staying true to the bone-in variants. Mashed potatoes and gravy - always excellent.  Cole slaw, good but not superb. Biscuit, also good but not superb.  To be honest, I was leaning towards giving Bojangles 5-stars but the food snob in me is keeping it 4-stars, because I do feel that it's easy to make food taste good when you load it with breading, butter, and oil. I did have daydreams about Bojangles so you can tell that I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Mold on soda machine. Seen a employee eating chicken on back table; then used the same gloves they were eating the chicken with to make customers sandwich!!!! Disgusting !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great great service honestly.  The food was amazing. I enjoyed eating my meal here. The staff is beyond wonderful and work hard. Alot of impatient people dine here. The only thing I didnt like is 2 people confirmed me about needing money on the way back to my car. But over all it was great. They have cheerwine too!!"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what the fuss about Bojangles is. At the end of the day, it's a fast food joint. I was informed that I needed to try Bojangles at least once with recommendations of they chicken biscuit, fries, and sweet tea. I ordered the chicken biscuit combo that included all of the above and ordered a picnic size dirty rice since I have never had dirty rice before.  My combo was assembled within a matter of minutes and I found myself unraveling the chicken biscuit. Quite frankly, I was a bit sad. It was literally a piece of sadly breaded chicken on a sad biscuit. I think the highlight of the meal was the dirty rice."}
{"text":"In a world of chic fil a \"my pleasure\" level service as well as on demand food delivery, I don't understand why bojangles is still SO SLOW to embrace change.  When u notice the employees and even the clientele... Its not hard to see the vast differences.  Yoga moms at chic fil a and homeless at bojangles.  Young bright POLITE literate employees at chic fil a versus slow barely understandable older employees at bojangles... It's like going back in time and its always so slow that it takes a ton of time to get thru the line inside or outside.  (Todays drive thru visit took 19 minutes)  I'd never give them another thought if not for my boss occasionally wanting their food.  Please revamp all systems from the bottom up."}
{"text":"This location just can't EVER get the order correct.  Today I ordered a Chicken Supremes combo with a Pepsi.  That was it and she even repeated the order correctly, but when I get home, I've got a nasty, disgusting sweet tea.  WHY?  Why doesn't Bojangles understand that you can't staff your restaurants with trifling people and expect them to give adequate service to your paying customers?    This location is within a mile of their corporate offices; you'd think they'd be the absolute best that Bojangles has to offer, but sadly, it just never is.  They can however be counted on to irritate you and give you a stressful experience... that's really what you're paying for.  My money is tighter than ever, and I just can't continue to give Bojangles chance after chance with my hard earned dollars anymore."}
{"text":"Chicken Biscuit is soo BOMB... Too bad there are no \"Bo Jangles\" in Cali..."}
{"text":"Was the slowest fast food experience ever. It was 20 min and there just to get the food.  Was at least 6 employees and only 4 in the building customers I could see.  The food was fine but they were slower then then I have ever seen. Good thing I was not in a rush. How do they not have chicken tenders in under 15 min. Even if the are frozen, they can deep fry them in under that."}
{"text":"This has to be the most poorly run Bojangles chicken in the entire chain. The service here is extremely slow and inconsistent. The food is also inconsistent. Unfortunately it's the closest Bojangles to my office and I have to frequent this location. I wish there was another place that I can go to instead of this poorly run Bojangles. I have contacted Corporate on several occasions and nothing seems to be done. They really need to look at correcting the problems at this location."}
{"text":"When I'm running a little behind and find that I have no time left for breakfast at home this Bojangles is in the perfect location between home and work. I can always stop in and grab the morning cajun filet biscuit with Botato rounds and be done with breakfast by the time I get to work. Convenient location and always super-fast here! Even my regular Mickey-Dees can't top the service speed at this Bojangles. And could you believe I used to not like Bojangles? I just didn't know what I was missing. Hey three stars is just an average rating - nothing negative about it because I know I'll be back at least once a month."}
{"text":"Just wow...I seriously should've heeded the warning of previous reviews and tips before heading in here. Alas, I had made my way to the area for a different restaurant that had turned out to be shut down. Therefore, my craving for a chicken and rice bowl had to be satiated.  Now when I got here, my first sign of what I was in for should've been the condition of the parking lot and the lack of customers dead in the middle of lunch time. Had to have my bowl. Then it should've been the sanitation score of 90. Not horrible. Gotta have my bowl. Then maybe the 5 minute wait at the cash register without another soul in line in front of me. Bojangles...it's bo-wltime.  Finally my order was taken and $5 and change later I had my bowl. It was totally worth it, by the way. But it was about the only thing worth it in here. The tables were messy. I guess all the orders were coming through the drive thru because it was empty inside but they stayed busy in the back. After I had ordered I waited entirely too long to call this fast food. At least one person that came in after me got their food before me. I would literally never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Habitually the worst Bonangles I've ever been to although the one on South Blvd has bad reviews too so this one might not be the absolute worst. I've been here like 5-10 times since I moved to Charlotte. Every single time, without fail, there is something wrong with my order. I've never had fresh tea at this location. Today was the final straw. My tea was crap once again. My French fries were like old greasy McDonald's fries absolutely drenched in Cajun seasoning to the point I couldn't even eat them. My biscuit was old and lukewarm. The person working the drive thru couldn't even take orders and process payments at the same time. I sat at the window and watched him take three orders before he took my card for payment. It's just not worth hoping I'll get decent food when I go here when I can bank on the CFA next door to always deliver for a similar price. I'm so disappointed bc I come from southwest raleigh and went to the Western Blvd bojangles. That bojangles is the busiest one in the whole company and I only had an issue there one time in 5 years while in raleigh!! This is unacceptable honestly, especially in the city where Bojangles originated. I am less of a fan of Bojangles because of this location."}
{"text":"There isn't a whole lot to be said about Bojangles' that you wouldn't know already.  If you haven't had their Cajun-style chicken, you might want to try it.  I personally don't care for their biscuits, but then I'm not really a biscuit person.  I just order a bun instead of a biscuit and it's not a really a problem.  My main issue with this location comes down to the service, and while they are nice enough, it might actually be an issue with corporate policy, because I seem to have to go in and get extra items (as I usually go through the drive-through when I'm at this store, and I always forget to check before I leave the window).  You often get a single napkin, and rarely get straws with your drinks.  In your car, that just doesn't cut it.  If you're in the dining room, it's not a big deal.  But it also defeats the purpose of the drive through!  Doesn't change the taste of the food however...  Sweet Tea Report:  Bojangles' has \"famous\" sweet tea.  But why is it famous?  I have never had any that is particular sweet, which means it almost always has a very strong tea taste, and I don't particular care for it.  If that's your thing, then you may enjoy it, but I don't like it much."}
{"text":"Unlike many other Bojangles, this one looks like it was built sometime this century.  While it may very well be the only one that actually was built in the last ten years - or perhaps it was just renovated since it is near the center city and people other than those who live in Charlotte might see it - it actually looks pretty nice.  Unlike some other chains that have decided to really reinvent themselves in recent years (see McDonald's and Wendy's to name just a couple), Bojangles really only decided to clean.  It made a bit of a difference, but ultimately they are still Bojangles.  The chicken can beat most places in town, and it is nice that you have a fresh place to grab it rather than the dark and dingy restaurants that you usually have to visit.  I feel like enough of a scumbag due to my normal habits, this makes me feel just a little bit better.  Thanks Bojangles!"}
{"text":"Even after all this time I don't know if I'm sold on Bojangles.  It isn't so much that their chicken is bad or anything - it's just that it isn't all that.  And I guess I grew up eating Chick-Fil-A (actually I didn't have CFA, but once I tried 'em, I was sold), so I prefer the softer taste of the CFA chicken to that of Bojangles.  That said, the chicken isn't bad - it's just that it is this tiny crispy little hunk of fried chicken that isn't really anything special and you don't get much of it for the price you pay.  Especially if you get it in a sandwich with extras (such as cheese), the cost really does add up quickly.  Now if you get a sausage biscuit or something it's not bad - but who would go to a chicken place for a sausage biscuit?"}
{"text":"This Bojangles' is in a pickle.  To my knowledge they do not actually serve pickles, but they are stuck right next to a Chick-Fil-A .  The only saving grace - perhaps funny because of the fact that CFA is often associated with very Christian beliefs, even being closed on Sundays - is that they are not quite in the exact same market.  However, they are very similar.  While CFA provides a menu focused primarily on the chicken sandwich, and now even has a spicy chicken sandwich (one that is fairly tasty to boot), Bojangles' serves a spicy chicken biscuit.  Worlds apart, right?  Other than the biscuit vs. sandwich debate, Bojangles' definitely has more variety, with country ham, sausage and steak, but where they really come through is your regular fried chicken (the sort with bones).  CFA has none.  Of course, if you prefer the boneless variety, this may not matter much.  At that point, it comes down to which you prefer, and on that front it is purely a matter of taste.  I happen to like both - and while the CFA building is nicer, both are fairly decent.  Unfortunately neither is particularly easy to get into or out of, so roll the dice and try them both.  You may or may not want to do it on different days.  It just depends on your appetite."}
{"text":"At least judging by the building itself, this does not appear to be the newest in the Bojangles' chain, but it is actually quite nice.  When you go into some of them, it feels like you have entered another world - like crossing over into the dingy underside of the Cool World, with no hip Detective Harris to pop out and save you.  As Seth mentioned, it may be the fact that it is in Mint Hill.  It might be that there is less traffic than many locations, such as the ones on Albemarle or Independence.  I really wish I knew.  But whatever the case, it is a decent location and you generally do not need to feel like taking bathing in antibacterial lotion after you leave, and you can just enjoy the spicy chicken goodness."}
{"text":"Somewhat conveniently located not far from the airport, this location has been remodeled recently and looks nice. It's actually not what you would probably expect from a Bojangles (or many fast food places). You can get in either from a short turn off of Billy Graham or you can take the back way from Old Dowd into the airport.  Service is typically quick, probably because of the location - it's not right on any major road, so they don't seem to be busy any time I've ever been there. Food is typically about what you would find at any other Bo. No complaints, as they are easy enough to get into and back out of."}
{"text":"Bojangles is by far my favorite fast food joint. Sadly I havent got my food quicker than 15 minutes at this location. The food is always consistant as expected at a fast food chain but the service here has been soooo slow. The employees seem nice and all but I have never seen service so slow. If it gets better I will be happy to review again."}
{"text":"Ehhh ... it was OK. I got the Cajun fillet biscuit and the berry biscuit. I was waiting at the airport to board my flight and decided to try this. To be honest, I like Chick-fil-A chicken biscuits better :-/   The berry biscuit was OK as well. Mehhhh...  I'm not very hard to please when it comes to food (#fatkidtendencies) but when I've had better, I must admit it. I probably won't try this place again."}
{"text":"I've never had issues with this location. Lines can sometimes be long but that's about it. They have never messed up on an order that I've placed either. Fried chicken and sweet tea is always on point."}
{"text":"I've gotta admit, of all the fried chicken fast food places, I like this chain the best. The service was great, and the food is better than Popeye's, Church's, or KFC (all in Houston). The fried chicken has a great crunch and flavor; the french fries are delicious with its unique seasoning. Every time I go to NC and I need a quick meal, Bojangles is the place!"}
{"text":"My former co-worker from NC used to rave about Bojangles' chicken and so you can imagine my excitement when we had a connecting flight in Charlotte and this mustard color themed storefront was staring me in the face.   So I will preface this rating by saying I understand that any airport iteration of a restaurant is going to be lacking the charm and quality of their non-airport versions.  Bottom line - for airport food it was good. I'd much prefer this fried chicken over anything else in the airport. The biscuit was good too. But if I'm comparing, this was no better than the similarly Cajun influenced Popeye's chain. I'd say this is more of a guilty pleasure because it was greasier and tasted more unhealthy than usual. That's a good thing in my book if we're judging fried chicken. While Bojangles didn't jangle my whole existence, I'd come back to it like I'd come back to any Popeye's.   Service was super nice and fast which is appreciated for weary travelers."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru line for 20 mins only because they charged my card & had to go in. No one ever came out or gave me my order. Went in& they had a communication disconnect & were extremely nice & I got my food"}
{"text":"If you want to avoid homophobic right-wing religious Chick-Fil-A, shlep way down Concourse B by gate B9 for a mediocre \"meal\" rung up (served is too generous a term) by miserable workers. Have a salty biscuit with no butter, just some spread. You're welcome. And you have to pay for this miserable experience eating in a filthy \"dining room\". Misery thy name is Bojangles."}
{"text":"Went here twice this week and I've had the best experience I've had in years of coming to this location. Fast, Friendly and service with a smile. I'm excited for this new change at this location. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I visit this Bojangles ever so often and normally have no issues.  Today, however was a different experience. My family came in for dinner around 7:00 and placed orders. Mine was the last to be ordered and I waited on my family's food. Food became to be assembled and when my sandwich (Cajun Filet) came up, the employee threw my sandwich down so hard it came un wrapped! No apologies no offer to re-wrap. Nothing. I had to re wrap the sandwich myself!   And they screwed up my order and gave me fries when I ordered mashed potatoes and gravy. When I asked for the correction, this employee just out the product in my hand. No word. No thank you. Terrible attitude.  Clearly it was this employee as the others were welcoming and friendly."}

{"text":"The chicken is the BEST.  I look fwd to stopping here before I board my flt back to Chicago.  The only issue I have with this location is not being able to get a refill and the counter staff has ZERO customer service skills.  Food: Five Stars Service: 0 stars for this location"}
{"text":"Bojangles is not chik fil a. However this location does not disappoint on the fries. I swear they are always fresh and taste delicious! I would recommend the Cajun fillet biscuit, mashed potatoes and gravy, potato wedges, and fries. It's the best choice for fast food chicken in Waxhaw. The drive through is usually speedy and the staff is nice enough. It's Bo-Time!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast one very cold morning at 7am. The service thru the drive thru was fast, the breakfast was hot, the drinks were cold. It's no Chick Filet but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went this morning at 7:45 and was greeted by an unsmiling cashier. Took my order and handed me my ticket. It took longer than usual to fill simple order (nothing ou of the ordinary). Food was ok, lukewarm and one of my biscuits had obviously been sitting under heat lamp for some time. Very dry and hard. Went back for coffee refill and was told they were out because coffeemaker was broken, and the guy had to repair it. At 8am, a restaurant specializing in breakfast is out of coffee and has only one coffeemaker. Unbelievable!  Manager never came out to apologize nor did any other employee. This is my second time with very poor service at this location. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My first ever Bojangles experience was at this airport location. It made me hunt one down in Florida. I wish all airports had one..."}
{"text":"where is the gm,   please help, the staff is very unpleasant, disrespectful just getto got a cup of coffee... it was murky, thick, slimy,  biscuit was dough, chicken filet was tuff got it at the drive thru window, the cashier was a snob.. poor customer service skills, and she was the manager,  when i got to work am, found that my food was despicable,  i called back and asked to speak with the manager,  she was rude to say the lesser, unprofessional, vulgar total disrespect.. i would advise corporate to send a secret shopper there pronto  in short do not patronize this facility  because that's exactly what it's become  b e w a r e"}
{"text":"This is a very well run Bojangles location. Convenient to uptown for the drive into work for breakfast and heading out of uptown for dinner. The family variety pack is the Big Bo Box with both chicken on the bone and chicken supremes plus 3 large \"picnic\" sides with 8 biscuits and a half gallon of tea for $28! This feeds my family for 2 days plus biscuits for breakfast. Also a great choice for Panthers tailgating."}
{"text":"I'm a Bojangles' though this one is in a little mini-food court setup and can be easy to forget. This most recent experience I was doing a poor job ordering but he drive thru order taker helped me out suggesting the family variety feast which really offers a little bit of everything to make everyone happy and we ended up with some leftover biscuits and chicken for breakfast and lunch the next day. Food was solid Bojangles' quality as usual. I love the dirty rice. I hear cinnamon biscuits are coming back on 11/21 so I need to get back next week for those. Yummy."}
{"text":"A little slower than some Bojangles' in the morning but the people are still friendly and the food is Bo-Tastic. Perfect for picking up a Big Bo Box of tailgate goods or a morning biscuit."}
{"text":"First of all it's no secret I am a Bo fan but not all Bo's get a 5. This location was completely demolished and rebuilt as a new concept with a beautiful biscuit theatre, gorgeous menu boards and all new presentation of drink and condiment stations. Service is better with people walking around to make sure you have what you need (a spork for example) and they will bring the food to your table. Mine made it to my table just after I got my legendary sweet tea. I had just put my number down.   I had the supremes combo with dirty rice and the were super fresh and hot. The dirty rice was perfect. I didn't see butter but the staff brought me some. The biscuits don't really need it but I was feeling indulgent today. Check out the new place!"}
{"text":"Did I love my chicken and fries because this was my first meal in the USA after two weeks in Europe? Maybe, but it was delicious! I had a delicious grilled chicken sandwich which I would happily get again! I also had some fries which were good but very salty.  I liked the chicken and would happily go to Bojangles again.  Two detractors: too much salt and Pepsi. Pepsi is evil and nasty. I had to walk across to the gift store to get a coke."}
{"text":"Two things you do NOT want to do when dealing with the hungry and rushed, especially when they're late for their flight but they still love(d) your product SO much, that they risk missing it. #1... Never tell a customer that you will ONLY take a credit or debit card because the \"cash drawer is being counted\". #2... Never count a cash drawer right in front of the customer! It's nasty and in this case, served no purpose other than to give the lady with the attitude something to point at while she makes snide remarks about you to her coworker. Look, I know you don't like your job. I've worked in fast food and NO ONE really likes their job. But at LEAST have the decency to keep your sorry ass home on those days when you just can't take it anymore! I have traveled many miles and am a \"Top Ten % Reviewer\" for Trip Advisor, which out of all the reviewers in LA means I tell it like it is and I am here to tell you that I have never been so hated and snapped at than I was at the Bojangle's beside gate B9 at Charlotte Douglas Airport on the afternoon of 10/21/2015.  If they treat their customers this crappy, I hate to think of what they do to their food. Lost a lifetime customer with one crappy attitude. Way to go Bo!  Avoid this venue at ALL costs!"}
{"text":"i ordered the cheddar bo biscuit add sausage and egg and bo rounds. the cheese was burned to the foil and the egg was overcooked. the cheese tasted waxy and the egg had brown markings on it. i wasnt able to eat it. i also didnt receive a recipt.  i tried calling the store to tell them about the experience but once i got someone they hung up on me when i ask to speak to a manager."}
{"text":"Bojangles' food is, of course, always outstanding and one of the best decisions you can make on a weekend morning.  I've been really impressed both times that I've visited this particular location. It's always really busy since it's very close to uptown, Dilworth, Elizabeth, and general life in Charlotte. It's the most central location of all the Bojangles. But they always provide extremely quick, quality service! My food has been piping hot and really good. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I went early in the morning and the kind man working made me a personal order even though the kitchen wasn't up and running yet. Excellent customer service in addition to the great food!"}
{"text":"I figure since I go here almost daily during the work week, I should probably give it a review. And, you have to figure since I go here pretty much daily during the work week that I really don't have any major complaints.   I've been really trying to make a conscience effort to be healthier, and I know that I've been cramming my face with some not so healthy, but delicious options during my weekends, I still try to stick to a grilled chicken sandwich with no mayo for lunch.   Now, I've had grilled chicken sandwiches before and none of them really tickled my taste buds. The first time I drove up to the drive thru during my lunch hour, I told the lady on the speaker (which is horrible by the way.. more on that in a sec.) that I needed a few minutes. I pondered over the ever delicious Bo Berry Biscuits, and the seemingly bland option of the grilled chicken sandwich.   Well, I've been doing Insanity, and I could hear Shaun T yelling at me from my computer at home, and that's a bit of distance to hear a big muscle man yelling at you! So I opted for the grilled chicken instead with a pouty face as I drove back to work.   I get back here and open up my sandwich and take that first bite... WOW!! YUM! This is the best grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had, and it's right around my calorie mark for a meal for Insanity. Perfect!   The speaker system sounds very echoish, and it's hard to hear them sometimes, but if that's my only complaint, then I'm good to go."}
{"text":"Bojangles could probably start world peace if used correctly. It is THAT good. We didn't have these up north, so once I became a resident of the south I was promptly taken here. As I said above, world peace and all... I get very angry if I'm not fed. It's like feeding Gizmo after midnight and getting a gremlin. Real Talk. So, those that know me best made a bee line for Bojangles for breakfast, because as we know that's the most important meal of the day right?  Well little did I know what was in store for me as we drove up. You've eaten at one chicken joint, you've had em all... Boy, was I wrong. No other chicken joint has BO BERRY BISCUITS. Holy God, these things would be the perfect bribery for me. \"Rob a bank? No way! What? You will give me unlimited Bo Berry Biscuits???? OK!!!!\" (OK, I wouldn't REALLY rob a bank, but this is the best way to emphasize how delicious these things are. Better yet, I think they are only .99 for TWO of them. That makes this poor girl pretty happy.   Every time I've gone to this location, they have been nothing but nice and even I have to admit as a non sweet tea drinker... yes, I just said it... I was even won over by how sticky sweet the tea is. They were serious when they said sweet!!!  But, Beth, you didn't even mention the chicken. Well, duh.. it's good too or I wouldn't shove it in my face hole. Seriously. I don't think you can lose with a Bo Jangles. I think every second of the day should be Bo Time."}
{"text":"I've reviewed a couple Bojangles, because, well... let's face it... I should probably just LIVE at this establishment with as often as I frequent the place. However, with that being said, I've noticed not all Bojangle's are treated equally either!   THIS location is one of the best I've gone to so far. When I drive up in the mornings I am greeted by a super nice person who get's me oh so ready for my delicious sweet tea and breakfast. I pull up my car, and it's not the traditional blaghedy blah blah from that speaker. Oh no, instead I get \"Welcome to Bojangles, it's BO TIME!\" I can hear the smile on her face when she tells me, and this makes me even more excited to get my sweet tea addiction satiated. NOM..  I pull around to pick up my stuff and the staff has ALWAYS had a smile on their face and my food and world peace curing tea is waiting for me. FAST service, and super friendly... what more can you ask for from a fast food joint?   IT'S BO TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"I dont know why I put myself through the hell of attempting to go through the drive through. I only get a 30 minute lunch and I spend 25 minutes of it waiting so I have to throw the food away. This place sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"The drive through is awful, I was almost on social security by the time I got my food and then I had to wolf it down so I could get back to work. This place is run by incompetent rejects."}
{"text":"Love fried chicken, sausage biscuits and seasoned fries. HATE the slow service.  One star for being such SLOW \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Very clean with friendly staff. Every time my out of town family comes to visit they go straight there. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try another chicken place, but it was actually very good. It is fast food but everything was good and the food was actually hot! So many times I end up with cold fast food."}
{"text":"It's about time I review my favorite fried chicken chain.  Yes, the quality of the actual branch may vary depending on location, but the quality and taste is pretty consistent.  So this review is really not about the actual location, but a love letter to Bojangles as a whole.  Bo's was the first ever restaurant my dad took my brother and I to when we first moved to Charlotte, NC the summer of 1996.  It was a hard time as we moved to a new state, and I had to start my sophomore year at a new high school where everyone practically grew up together.  Pre-Bo's my favorite fried chicken joint was Popeye's.  I'll never forget the first time I tried Bo's crispy, tasty, crunchy chicken skin or the saltiness of the Cajun fries.  The dirty rice blew me away - yummy pork sausage in the rice, what?  I got hooked on sweet tea because of Bo's.  And who doesn't love the Bo Berry Biscuit??  Thus began my lifelong love of Bojangles.  It has been present at most important milestones in my life: my friends held a surprise 18th birthday breakfast for me at the location near our high school; we ordered tons of tailgate specials throughout college and pharmacy school at UNC-Chapel Hill; it was one of the first meals I was able to eat again after losing my Dad to a heart attack the summer of 2010; it's the meal I eat at the airport every time I flew home to take care of my mom while she was fighting breast cancer and now when she's fighting heart failure.  Sadly, I live in Chicago which does not have any Bojangles.  I make it a point to eat it at least once when I'm in town.  This location happened to be the one my brother drove us to directly from the airport when I flew in for my mom's scheduled heart surgery.  It was already a stressful time, but we were greeted with patience at the drive-thru ordering machine and with a smile at the pick-up window.  That and the familiar comfort food helped me emotionally prepare for my mom's surgery - which thankfully went well.  Thank you Bo's for the food and especially the memories - both the good and the bad.  You are the definition of comfort food to me.  BTW, I seriously considered bringing Bo's chicken up for my wedding in Chicago, but the logistics were the limiting factor."}
{"text":"Guys... I have had a love affair going with Bojangles... since age 5. I have so many memories of my Dad and I stopping in to get fresh hot french fries with the perfect amount of that delicious spicy seasoning! When I was little it was so hot I had to always make sure I had a water with me (...or cheerwine which I also have a love affair with). Alas, we moved to Oklahoma, so my Bojangles experience is limited to bottled cheerwine and seasoning sent in the mail for Christmas and frozen steak fries from the grocery store.  This Bojangles is conveniently located by the airport to stop in and have some yummy chicken, biscuits, French fries, or even a delicious Boberry biscuit. Right now they are under construction, but the drive thru is opened for orders.   I definitely recommend stopping in if you've never had it!"}
{"text":"Not bad ... Liked their chicken bites rice bowl. Clean, polite staff, easy in and out."}
{"text":"By far the worst bojangles in Charlotte. Never can I come to this location and get what I ask for. They have screwed up pretty much every way possible. They need new management and staff."}
{"text":"Sucks all around bad service bad food the drive through machine is down out of honey mustard and with only three cars in front of me I have been waiting fifteen minutes to get my food. Just horrible experience all alround"}
{"text":"OK. I haven't eaten Bojangles in over 2 decades so my memory might be off. And to be fair,  I know that airport food tends to be made a little more bland for satisfying a wider range of people (IE.  Popeye's chicken at airports compared to standard locations)  I remember Bojangles having some good flavor and a bit of kick. This location made bland,  flavorless chicken. Even the spice was really subdued and only hit in strong,  burning waves that did not add flavor. The crust was rubbery and stale even though the chicken was very hot. The mashed potatoes we're  decent but not great and the biscuits was average at best. This does not make me want to go eat Bojangles again and makes me miss Popeye's,  even the ones at airports. Churches chicken was better and they are about as bland as it comes."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Bo's, I remember Robert Murphy doing their ads on BIG WAYS radio circa 1979. He was the funniest morning DJ ever to work in Charlotte, a legend, really. We lost him to Chicago, but that's another story. His straight man of 1000 voices sidekick, Larry Sprinkle, is still doing weather at WCNC TV.  Anyway, Murphy MADE Bojangles a success here. You couldn't hear his Bojangles spots without wanting their coffee and their buttermilk biscuits, their dirty rice and their cajun-spiced fried chicken. One mention, and I'd be heading that way... drooling on my tie.  Bojangles is our local phenomenon, started in a little restaurant in South Charlotte. If you're a visitor, this is our contribution to fast-food-chain America. Try it; it's a guilty pleasure. It's not good for your cholesterol level or your waistline, but it tastes like pure comfort.  Most locations are great. Don't miss the buttermilk biscuits! I know Northerners and Westerners who have to pig out at Bo's or they don't think they came to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Never have I experience such bad customer service at an Bojangles in my life.  My family and I arrived at the Bojangles locations around 10:03pm.  As we pulled up we actually thought they were closed because it seem like all the workers were in the lobby looking out the window at us.  Once we realized they were open we could see the disgruntle looks on the workers faces as we pulled up to the drive through.  We ordered 2 supreme combs with season fries, honey mustard, 2 cinnamon biscuits, tea, and pink lemonade. When we got to the window the lady stated that there would be a 5 min wait for the biscuits and that we would have to pull around front.  Once there we ended up waiting there for 25 mins!  Now I know that 5 mins is not 25 mins and I became very anger because during this process I still see staff members playing and not doing their job.  Eventually the girl that took out order came out and stated that it would be a bit longer because the cook never heard the order.  I'm thinking to myself I no they didn't because they were playing the whole-time. Just a waste of my time and money and the worst Bojangles I've been too!!  This certainly needs to be changed as well as my time needs to be comp!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of Bojangles at first after my friend told me to try it. I traveled all the way from California so I had to try it. At first, I thought this was another KFC, but boy was I wrong. I ended up getting 4 legs, 1 wing, a side of mashed potatoes and another side of green beans plus one of their famous pies.  The meat was very tender and tasty. This is much better than KFC back home and church's chicken. It's comparable with Popeyes, I would say. This was my first time trying southern sweet ice tea, which is supposedly also very good and a must-try. The only complaint I have about their ice tea is that the sweetened version is much too sweet. The more I drank, the thirstier I became.  The only reason this place didn't get a 5 is because it's really oily and of course unhealthy. But of course you get what you pay for. I spent a total of $7 for everything. I'm definitely coming back next time to get one of their breakfast items, which looks good in the picture menu."}
{"text":"Just waited In line for 10 mins and after I ordered was told they are out of chicken for the night.  Bojangles our of chicken or don't want to make it?  Waste of time"}
{"text":"Holy. Cannoli, Batman! The service is INCREDIBLY SLOW! As nice as people are, it so slow"}
{"text":"I absolutely love bojangles so not surprisingly I've been to several locations. But this one by far is the worst I've ever been to. The food was consistent so this is not a complaint about that, its the service. My boyfriend and I went here after going to south park mall and a short, light skinned girl with short light brown hair took her sweet time to come to the register. Not only that, she didn't greet us but just gave us a look saying, \"are you gonna order?\" She was very passive aggressive and seemed like she just didn't care. I thought it was because she was having a bad day, but when am elderly white couple went to her, she took her sweet time again, but at least she was nice... Or at least I heard laughter from afar. Just because we're Asian does not mean we do not speak English so we do not deserve the treatment we got here. Remember, we're there to help you. Just know that we are never going to this bojangles location ever again."}
{"text":"When the chicken is marinated and cooked properly its the best chicken you will get from a fast food place."}
{"text":"There is almost always a huge line for this place.  I guess its better than Popeyes but I wish they had salads so I could pretend to be healthy."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is really good - better than popeyes! I liked the green beans and the fact that they serve breakfast all day (even though I have sworn not to eat any of that fatty, artery-clogging, biscuit-egg goodness). The sweet tea here is also pretty legendary as they have so clearly advertised.   4 stars just because my arteries are clogged and I'm struggling to get out of this Bojangles food coma right now."}
{"text":"Nothing really special to write home about.  Actually, probably nothing really special to write on Yelp about either. =B  dmo out"}
{"text":"05.17.11  I wish I weren't such a sucker for fried chicken.  But, I am.  And Bojangles makes it with the best of them.  The skin is breaded, and fried, but it still manages to maintain moisture through the meat.  And it's juicy and crispy.  Like!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service ALL of the time. I love walking distance from this Bojangles and frequent it often in hopes of he food and the service being better. But it never is! The food is never fresh, and the workers act as if they just don't want to be at work. This restaurant needs some major improvements because it not at all delicious as I know a Bojangles can be! Every single time I go, I fill out the survey & it's always horrible. I'm not one of those people ok who only write when something is bad, I do give credit where credit is due but place... deserves NONE."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru line for an HOUR. I went inside at 1st & the employees were in no hurry. No sense of urgency. The food was wrong when we finally got it. Go elsewhere, this place is awful!!!"}
{"text":"HATE TO ADMIT IT, but I'm addicted to Bojangles fried chicken.  This is a relatively new location.  Drive through FAST.  Doesn't seem to be very busy.  A bit tough to get in and out of off Wilkinson Boulevard.    Staff has always been nice.  Food hot & fresh.  Clean store.  It's Bojangles."}
{"text":"This is some juicy chicken. I had the 2-piece white with fries, biscuit and Sierra Mist for lunch yesterday. Even the cashier made jokes with me. It's right in the bus depot so you won't miss it. There is a seating area for those who aren't rushing."}
{"text":"All I could say is Damn they gypped me!! I don't go to this particular Bojangles often but I was craving the chicken tenderloins after a hard workout at the gym.  Went thru the drive thru and ordered the 4 piece chicken tenderloins combo with a sweet tea.  Came home and there were only 2.5 chicken tenderloin pieces! Wtf! For the first time in my life going to this Bojangles was a mistake! Either they don't know how to count 4 chicken tenders or they just decided to gyp someone! Go to other Bojangles but I don't recommend going to this one unless you want to get gypped!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming here! We came here for a quick bite to eat after a long day and went through the drive-thru. My husband placed the ordered and when we drove up to the window, my husband gave the attendant the money and she said \"we out of biscuits. What you want me to do?\" She didn't greet him at all and her tone was very rude so we assumed she was talking to a co-worker so he simply didn't respond. There was no way in the world she could possibly be speaking to him so rudely for no apparent reason. The employee rudely said \"HELLLOOO!\" and rolled her neck, as if she were speaking to a child and thought her behavior was acceptable. In utter disbelief, I told her to give my husband the money back. She said \"unh unh! What's wrong with her?!\" When I responded \"your attitude!\" and let her know we'd be going elsewhere. As we drove off, instead of apologizing, she loudly proclaimed \"she ain't want nothing from here no way!\" That entire exchange really annoyed me because the employee thought the way she spoke to us was acceptable. Customer or not, that's no way to speak to anyone, ever!! This location won't get my business and I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone at all."}
{"text":"Why would you rate a Bojangles? Well-I have never had a friendlier staff in one of these types of restaurants. It is fast-food with more than a smile. The service was quick and the order correct!  The biscuits are fabulous! Slight spice to the breading on the chicken-not too much. The cole-slaw was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy were okay-I'll go for something else next trip!  Clean, fast and cheap if that is what you looking for!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn awesome biscuts and breakfast sandwhichs ,The chicken was awesome to."}
{"text":"Horrible service. You should fire the entire staff. 1pm on Sunday and have been sitting in line for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I thought it was something I did , but judging from others experience at this location I can stand by my one star rating. I highly doubt any of these employees value their jobs at this bojangles . The lack of respect, motivation to smile , and pure sense for service is evident at this bojangles ."}
{"text":"It's amazing how taste can change in 2years.  Everything was flavorless, stale, cooked in old grease and nothing like we remember."}
{"text":"I was here in the morning time. Must say.. EVvvvvvvery time I come here, I feel like I should bring my AARP card, cards to play Bridge, Tea and maybe some crumpets. lol  IT is the place where our elderly citizens come sit and chat a spat. (hey.. it ain't nothing wrong with that.. right!!)  Coffee steaming Hot Front extreamly clean"}
{"text":"Oh dear. I'm in love with bojangles. That is one really tasty biscuit. I've only been to 2 other bojangles near south park and this one is def tons better than that one.  They put chunks of beef in the gravy for mash potatoes AND in their dirty rice!  Chicken is great, not as amazing as Price's but I come here for lunch a lot. Did i mention how much i love their biscuits!?"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I sit in the drive through for at least 15 minutes and I'm not exaggerating. The workers are friendly but if you are in a hurry forget about it."}
{"text":"I love Bo time on an occasional cheat day... Last night after the movies around 10pm we stopped by for something quick. They didn't have much chicken left because of the special deal they had in September. We ended up with a four piece with fries. The fries were rather tasty but the chicken looked funny. It tasted old; like maybe they fried it in the morning and left it in the pan all day. They are known for their fabulous chicken and biscuits so I wish they would have been closed for the night rather than serve something below par. I definitely wasn't impressed butt it's Bojangles so hopefully it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I arrived to Charlotte on a Monday evening and figured that I would stop by a brewery before heading to my hotel to grab a bite to eat and a beer, however their food truck wasn't operating that night. So I had to find something quick on my way to the hotel and the sign for chicken and biscuits sounded too good, so I figured that a stop was in order.  I decided to just use the drive thru and ended up going with a 4 piece home-style combo, much to my disappointment when I got to the hotel I discovered that they failed to include a biscuit. The chicken itself was poor quality, even for fast food standards, it was dry and really lacked any taste. I will say that my  Mac & cheese side was probably the only good part of the meal, and that really isnt saying all that much.  Overall I would skip Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits and just go elsewhere, you are not missing out on much."}
{"text":"The artificial lemon they put in their tea is disgusting. Why can't I just get a regular sweet tea why does there have to be lemon in it.. 0 our of 5 ruined my okay meal, nothing special. These sorts of places makes me want to cook my own food because you don't know what kind of flavors you're going to get. They all do their operations differently, it is really sad they all can't do things the same way."}
{"text":"Fast food chicken done right.   The people who work here are always nice, pleasant and helpful. The dirty rice and pinto beans are my favorite side items. I also enjoy the green beans.  If you happen to get the biscuits when they first cone out of the oven you r in for a real treat. This is coming from me a person who is not a biscuit lover."}
{"text":"The best Bojangles in the area they have filmed commercials at this location.its real clean the food is great we all go there for lunch once a week the food is good the service is good too good fast food really"}
{"text":"This chicken is better than Popeye's and KFC. It's too bad I'd have to travel so far to get them. I had the Cajun Spicy Chicken and some biscuits that were quite tasty. It's probably a good thing I don't live close to Bojangles though or I'd be going here all the time. Stop in if you're in the area. It's a pretty well known chain in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Stop a various other Bojangles' after high school  Football games.  Usually the biscuits are cold and not very good. Last night we stopped at Bo's on Hwy 21, Fort Mill and the biscuits we were served  Was the best biscuits I have ever had!   Great job!"}
{"text":"It was our first meal in the States after being in St. Martin for a week. My husband and I were craving some good old fried chicken for dinner before our flight home to SFO, and low and behold - we saw Bojangles near our terminal!  Chicken was good - crispy, somewhat spicy - and it reminded us a lot of Popeye's. Overall very good chicken but nothing too special."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!  Stopped by on my way to work for some breakfast. I went inside despite the rain due to having an issue in the past.  No one was at the register when I walked in and after standing there five minutes I just walked out. The young ladies working were too busy trying to call a coworker who late and could not be bothered to assist their customers.  I will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"This is to corporate office, please train store employees on customer service in this location before you lose more customers. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I must say this is the most inept group of people I have ever seen working in one establishment together, that being said  Bo's is still pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Do not eat here until they change their ways...  Service area was disgustingly filthy.  The last time I went here I walked out because it was so dirty and the chicken looked burnt and old.  I chalked that experience up as a fluke because they were at the tail end of the supper rush.  Today I stopped in and the situation was all but the same, except it was 7pm, no customers were in the store.  Filthy dirty, the chicken I received was burnt and tasted like the oil it was old and burnt - to top it off, my order was wrong.  Don't do it...."}
{"text":"Just came through the drive thru ordered 8 piece tailgate special didn't get any plates utensils& condiments.  I didn't even get napkins!! The chicken was cooked to death not much meat on them!! Biscuits dry and hard!! Tea was hot asked for some ice cups!! Hey just be honest if you can't sell me enough chicken?? I'll buy something else wasting $23!!!!"}
{"text":"I get it...the biscuits are fresh, and overall Bojangles is good (fast food) fried chicken, but waiting 30 minutes to get said food, and then being told that they're out of mac and cheese, after that wait, is just unacceptable. The franchise spent a lot of time and money revamping this location, and they can dress it up, but their service and turn around time is honestly awful. I have never been to this location and been served in an efficient manner, it's always at a slower than snails pace.   This review isn't about their food, Bojangles is a staple Charlotte establishment and serves good fast food fried chicken, but it's about their awful and slow service. I am one that if you communicate and say, \"hey,  we put a new batch in the fryer, it'll be 20 minutes\" than I know what to expect. However this isn't the case here, or at least never when I've been here. This location just needs to do better."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here between flights on my way back home to California. I was surprised to see a fried chicken place at an airport, so I thought I'd give it a try. Got a fried chicken biscuit that was tasty and the people behind the counter were really friendly. Only downer was that there wasn't any area to sit down, but other than that, I like this place."}
{"text":"Bojangles is the South-East's most celebrated fast-food joint, and it was only when I tried the legendary sweet tea (it is especially known for it!), and their dirty rice, that I knew what they were all talking about and nearly considered moving to Charlotte.  Well, not really, but it definitely was a welcome change to the conventional fast food options such as McDonald's, KFC, Jack in the Crack, etc.    As I mentioned, the sweet tea is famous at Bojangles, though it was so saturated in saccharine that my teeth started tingling by the eighth sip.  Nevertheless, I couldn't stop sucking down the whole 12-ounce cup until it was completely drained.  I didn't eat much here since it was just a quick stop before going to Paramount's Carrawinds, but I had one chicken 'n biscuit and a small side of dirty rice.  The chicken was yummy and the biscuit was incredibly buttery but good.  The dirty rice, however, was my favorite out of my items...rice with veggies, special spices, and sausage.  yum. I could have ordered a large of that alone and have been satisfied.   Bojangles has several locations all around the Carolinas, so make sure to hit it up if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I gotta say, this chicken was the shit!! First, I went to the drive-thru and was trying to decide. They were friendly and patient from start to finish. I got the combo of  2 pieces of chicken, thigh and leg, came with a biscuit and your choice is side, which I picked  a side of Cole  slaw. The leg was tiny, a little overcooked and a little dry. But, that's ok. I ate the shit out of that crispy coating and started to head on to the delicious, meaty, tender, moist thigh. It made up for the tiny dry leg. It was a good size and the coating  was real crispy and delicious but I was a little surprised that it was a little spicy. The \"side\" of coleslaw is a stupid small portion but it was good, kinda like KFC. It needed a little more mayo. That biscuit tho! Shit!! It was big and fluffy and hot and I MURDERED it with butter. I paid about 5.50 and it was well worth it. DONT HATE ME, but this chicken was better than Price's. Trust me, Price's aint all that, but this chicken was! I wasn't disappointed. I really liked it and I'll be back, BoJay."}
{"text":"Slow is not the word to describe the staff at this location. The cashier was like still home in bed where she should have been !!! We ordered a double bacon biscuit and a no fishangler. They finally told us after the biscuit order was up the fish would take 7 ministers. We waited and waited. I went up and asked about it, the girl yelled how long on the fish and a reply was it just came up. Well it was barely warm when he opened it. NOT HAPPY with this location. I will be letting the owner know."}
{"text":"Really rude every time I come here. Takes about 20 min to get your food.  How long should it really take to put some chickens and fries into a box and hand it out the window. By the looks of the staff it's to be expected though."}
{"text":"One star is kind.... Service is non existent.  Wanted to see how long it would take...45 minutes....not again."}
{"text":"I recently traveled through Charlotte and although I don't normally eat fried food, I decided to try this place out because I had heard of it before and never tried it. I got a chicken tender plate with cajun fries and it came with a biscuit.   The Food  The chicken was ok, it wasn't stellar, and I thought the fried coating was overdone. I could not taste the chicken, only the batter which tasted good, but it was overpowering. The fries were ok, they are not my favorite type, but the seasoning wasn't overpowering and I could taste potato which was good. The biscuit was soggy and burnt around the sides. I did not enjoy it much, but I could tell that the flavor was good, and maybe if I went to another place, I would like it better. They also have a selection of pepsi products to drink as soda. I opted for a Mountain Dew, since I needed to stay awake. It was a bit costly to eat, at 9 dollars, so I wasn't impressed with this place at all.  The Service and Decor  The decor is typical airport. It's cramped, crowded, there is seating nearby that is usually filled during the rush, so its hard to find a spot. Typical airport problems. The customer service was ok. Nothing special. The woman who took my order was sitting on a countertop and sounded like she was on painkillers, so she may have had an injury or something like that. I'm not sure what was going on, but it was definitely different from what I have experienced in the past. She was polite at any rate and sped people through quickly.   Overall, I think my experience here was pretty bad, and I probably wouldn't go to Bojangle's at the airport again. I will however try it out again because I have a feeling that the restaurants outside of the airport will probably be a better experience."}
{"text":"Cajun Filet biscuit a nice morning wake-me-up. Don't forget the honey and Cajun hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I didn't know it was possible to be in heaven at an airport. Especially considering the freezing rain and snow is delaying everything.   The chicken is delicious. The biscuits are delicious. Nothing else to really day because that's all you need. Lifted my spirits and filled me up. I'm actually sad my flight is boarding because I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"Store employee was extremely unprofessionally the drive through window. She was sucking her teach and me and eating food while speaking directly in my face. I have been to this location since it is he closest to me but every single time my order is wrong. This last visit will be my last."}
{"text":"Bojangles is Bojangles just about everywhere you go. Good chicken, good fries. My 2 year old son is a biscuit lover at heart and these are his favorite biscuits. Staff is always friendly. Store and bathrooms are clean. We go here probably once a week for breakfast, but at least 3 times a week for biscuits, ha ha. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a little over a year and i love it. The service is awesome, at least it has been for me.   This location is clean and well kept. I've only had my order wrong once in my time patronizing this location. When i brought it to their attention, it was immediately fixed with no hesitation. Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"All I want to say is... My chicken was over-cooked, they forgot my ranch, I waited for about 30 minutes in the drive thru, and the drive thru staff was extremely cold and uninviting.   I get it, some places have off days. That's no problem. But I refuse to patronize a place where I'm made to feel like I'm bothering you for merely being there. If you're going to do that, at least make sure you don't over-cook my meal. I could tell the long line behind me, was going to get the same. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fat G. loves his fried chicken, especially if it's from the South.  On the way back to base, I was looking for a lunch option since we had left our hotel earlier than expected. Wanting to pass by some of the franchise places, I checked Bojangles out in the Concourse B side of the airport. (I realize now that Bojangles is a franchise, but it doesn't slow me down from checking out the place.)  There's a simple counter with the menu items above on the wall. On the right is a shared eating area with other restaurants, and you can see the planes go by too.  I ordered a two piece dinner, which came with a biscuit, leg and thigh, and Dirty Rice as my side. The biscuit was fresh and buttery, and the dirty rice was good, with chunks of meat in it. The chicken however was ok; it wasn't as dry as some Kentucky Fried Chicken orders I've had in the past. It was really greasy though, and not as controlled as Popeye's.  For what it's worth, it's a fine additional choice to all the food places in the airport. if you're looking for a snack or so, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"What a total waste. Our order was not only wrong but our food was cold. It was so bad in fact, that I went online and left specific feedback about what a terrible experience we had. Within 24 hrs, a representative from Bojangles called me and left a voicemail. When I returned his call, he didn't answer so I left a message. It's been two weeks and I have still heard nothing. Now, to be fair, when I filled out my comments online, I said I didn't need to be contacted. However, it's poor business practice to not return my call when you initially called me regarding the bad service provided."}
{"text":"forget church, your soul needs a Cajun chicken biscuit. STAT."}
{"text":"My wife got some biscuits and gravy. The sausage appeared to have been crumbled coarsely and added to a gravy. Not good at all. My wife also got some coupons at Fan Fest. Tghe girl at the drive-thru advised that they didn't honor them. I can undetstand that,m but it was the rude way that she spoke that aroused my ire. I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you go here, I hope PEGGY is at the register. Her energy is the best I've seen and any location. I've been to this location before and had the cashier just gives mean looks and barely wants to interact with you!! PEGGY literally brightened up my day and changed my whole perspective of this location!! Promote her!!"}
{"text":"Took a while for our order to get ready after we were rushed to order.  Team wasn't helpful at all.  The fried we got were cold and stale. The biscuits were raw in the middle. We had to return to the store for an exchange after we were already 6 miles away."}
{"text":"I waited 30 min and forgot the order horrible service probably the worst bojangles ever and i will not come back here ever"}
{"text":"First time ever trying Bojangles while in the Charlotte airport, after friends raved about it.  Total FAIL.  Order one simple thing, their Cajun chicken sandwich.  They messed up and gave me their grilled chicken sandwich, total let down.  Apparently Bojangles can't even get their most popular chicken type correct or they're trying to tell me I need to lose weight.  Either way, completely disappointed and let down.  I ordered one thing, and you got 0 of it correct, not cool."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Bojangles I have been to. Let it be known that Bojangles is one of the few fast food places I eat at not to mention enjoy but this location manages to make this beloved Charlotte institution look bad.   Disappointed that this is what a lot of out of towners will think of when they hear Bojangles. Overpriced cold and dry Cajun filet biscuits and even colder fries. Served to you by people that look as though they hate their job even more than that gate agent at B5 having to rebook an entire plane worth of passengers after a cancelation. And I paid how much for this?! I should've  just got a cheese plate from Beaudevin.   Do yourself a favor...get outta the airport and go 5 minutes down Wilkinson to the Bojangles there and be greeted by smiling friendly folks serving up piping hot CF biscuits and botato rounds/Cajun fries ( however you're feeling). They will also supply you with a honey mustard if you wish ( and you should). And don't forge the sweet tea( I like mine half and half). Mmmm. I digress..."}
{"text":"2nd stop for the morning after Jack in the box, not much better. Was waited on after standing at counter with 2 others for 5 minutes, young man who was the counter person was to busy trying to be cool.  Walked away and stayed away from counter for another 5 minutes (waiting on fries in the back) While waiting I watched a young lady put 2 biscuits in a box, look at them and turn them over, per another lady \"That way the gravy will cover the burnt top\". Usually pretty good service but today was not that day. I would pass on the Biscuits and gravy, service is better at Drive thru, she is not \"Trying\" to be cool.  Young man, when you set a bag on the counter between 2 customers and look away without talking, we do not know who's order it is. Proper response is \"This is your order\" not \"uh-huh\" when asked who's order it is.  Fast food has now gone to the adage of \"Take it or leave it\"  Maybe as consumers we should be leaving it more often....."}
{"text":"I think most of us are leery of fast food chains when looking for quality. And admittedly, it can be hit or miss. This Bojangles' location, however, is pretty consistent. My family lives close by so we order here more than we should. Nonetheless, it is because it's good food! Our orders have never been wrong, the quality is consistent and prices are more than fair. Like any fast food joint, you'll get the disgruntled teenage kid at the drive thru window, but then again this is Bojangles', not Del Frisco's. If you need good food, in huge portions at a fair price, this place is clutch. Just don't expect any 5-star service."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since I have been back in the Carolinas and I have been hankerin for some Bojangles. The biscuits were amazing as usual, same with the fried chicken. We did a mix and match with the sides and wow all the sides were worth it. If you love fried chicken this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Worst Bojangles I've ever been to.  Of course it is run by the university so I shouldn't have expected much.  I had to repeat my order 3 times.  She tells me I have to wait five minutes for eggs.  I patiently waited, only to find out it was her that was cooking them...and she hadn't started.  While she was cooking the eggs the other girl took the biscuits for other orders.  They then come up to me and ask if I want my bacon, egg, and cheese on a bun because they are out of biscuits.  Alternatively I could wait 10 more minutes on a biscuit.  I asked how many biscuits they had hoping to have at least one biscuit in between classes.  It was just not so.  I would advise anyone on campus to skip this garbage and head on over to chick fil a."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the food is always good. What ticked me off was the lady taking orders. I get it that it's early and there's a long line but seriously, you don't have to say \"is that all?\" after everything I ask for. I was buying for  big group but only got half if what I wanted because the lady obviously doesn't care how much I want to get. Don't try and rush me and then cut me off when I'm trying to get  more!"}
{"text":"The employees here were friendly. I did have trouble understanding why the lobby of this place was empty right in the middle of lunch rush. We passed three other restaurants that were jammed. That was the first sign to leave! The food was awful. The biscuit on my chicken sandwich tasted like lake water was used to make it, the sweet tea was weak, the fries were good.   In general this location looks shady. Dirty grounds and people hanging around outside the door who are not there eating(?) There's too many other choices to hand over my hard earned money for questionable atmosphere and ill prepared food."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Find another place to eat, there are plenty near by.  First time I went (oct 2016), waited for 20 minutes for a ham biscuit. I was second in the inside line.  I also called the customer service number to report a bad attitude employee who was very unprofessional in her communications, walked off the job in the middle of an order bc someone was complaining about their wait time. Throw her apron on the counter and said \"I'm not puttin up with this, y'all better come regulate this fool\" then walked outside and smiled at beside the front entrance door.  Second time yesterday, stood in line for 8 minutes and it didn't move once, I was the 8th person in line, so gauging by the first experience, it would be an hour.  The rude lady that walked out the first time, was still there and acted like she could care less about customer service.  Love Bojangles but won't go back here again.  The manager is an older lady and she seems like she's given up on life.  No engagement, obviously does not hold her people accountable.  Also, I asked to be contacted by Bojangles and they never did. Poor response by corporate to a very negative situation."}
{"text":"Came by today && the woman cleaning the drink machine proceeds to tell me, \"I just found the biggest roach!\". So then, to make a sure I heard her correctly I make sure that's what she said && she repeated it. I had already ordered && was drinking the lemonade as she was speaking. It was disgusting, I went back to the cashier && asked for my money back && threw away the drink. WOULDNT RECOMMEND to go to this bojangles EVER. && FYI sweetheart if it was just a water bug then your employees shouldn't be yelling out to customers about the ROACHES that are chillin."}
{"text":"When I had to transfer in Charlotte, all I got was Bojangles chicken. I mean what can beat fast and yummy fried chicken! I would say they are pretty decent - just by looking at the waiting line, you'll know how popular this place is. The chicken skin was not as crispy as what I would want it to be, but I loved the wings - they had the perfect flavor, also not TOO oily. My only complaint is its price..."}
{"text":"Still a solid choice for a quick lunch. Every once in a while, there's no sauce in the box. I've just taken to checking before I drive off.   The sanitation grade stays high, the workers are friendly and the food is always hot.   Ooh! And they have this Chicken Supremes salad now that's pretty darn good, too. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"The food here is just like every other Bojangles... Straight up delicious... But the thing is I love the staff here...   The sanitation score is consistently high... The coffee is always hot and delicious, which is tops in my book... Sometimes I just need a jolt to get me to the office! I head out to work well before 6 am and I have never encountered a rude or unhappy person on the microphone or at the window... My order is always correct, everything is always hot and yummy and I leave with a smile on my face...   These guys work hard to put out quality food before a lot of people even roll out of bed...  They clearly put the morning people on the drive thru in the early morning and for that?  Extra star for you, Bojangles... See you soon!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow and SLOW! I've stopped coming here cause they suck to no end. It's like the KFC/Taco Bell in Fort Washington, MD. Slow and the staff don't care how long you wait to place an order. The drive threw is always backed up like a clogged toilet."}
{"text":"Checking into my hotel after 9pm.  Good to see a Bojangles in front of my hotel. After check in made a quick trip over there for dinner to go.    Food was hot and staff was polite."}
{"text":"Um - I would like to report a rape !  I ordered a 2 piece dark meal with a side of fries and a bottle of water -   $10.57 - i should have told that kid where he could have put that chicken."}
{"text":"Slowest service, rudest people, worst food. I love bojangles, but this one is a joke. Sat in the drive through for 45 minutes, all for a terrible meal. Biscuit was flatter than a pancake and the chicken was super dry. I wouldn't recommended this place to a damn dog."}
{"text":"Customer service here is pretty crappy. But bojangles is awesome food. I find myself relying on bojangles after a night of drinking. Hits the spot every time. But what doesn't hit the spot is the amount of time it takes to get food here.   I stopped going inside here due to how long it takes and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I'm not saying I'm done with it but if it continues to get worse I'll start hitting up another bojangles."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Famous Bojangles chicken. I always look forward to stopping by here when we have long enough layover in this area. Two more days here means two more times I get to stop by."}
{"text":"I really think their chicken at this airport location is spicier than elsewhere. My choice to pick up food for flights when I'm at this airport."}
{"text":"Stopped into Charlotte's famous Bo Jangles during a layover on my way to LA.  I ordered the 4 piece supremes combo with a side of the bo jangles dipping sauce.  The Supremes are the spicy cousin of their regular chicken tenders.  After eating 2/4 chicken tenders, 1/3 of the biscuit and 1/2 the bag of deliciously seasoned fries I was done.  I decided that it was just not worth the calories to finish my entire meal. This is partially because I am fatter than ever, and partially because it just wasn't that spectacular.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't blow all your calories on it good.   The real star of the meal was my side of perfectly seasoned delicious fries. Next best was the biscuit. Terminal B doesn't seem to have too many dining options.  I would probably get Bo Jangles again on another layover but if they happen to open up a Panda Express or something similar in this terminal, that's where you'll find me."}
{"text":"Bojangles is my once or twice a month guilty pleasure. When It comes to the biscuits, Bojangles is the best of any other fast food place. The biscuits are large, fluffy and golden brown. My two favorites are the cajun flllet and the steak and egg. The sweet tea is very good, being just sweet enough without being to overly sweet. Great coffee as well. The chicken and sides are also very good. I always get mine cajun (hot), with dirty rice as my side. Most Bojangles I have visited are clean and the staff is friendly. Can't eat here to often because of the ol' waistline, but I do look forward to the times I do eat here!"}
{"text":"Breakfast or a quick late night snack the chicken biscuits are always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I was on a grease roll and didn't pretend to be healthy yesterday.  I ordered the 3 pieces (I should order 2 next time!) with the dirty rice and a side of warm mouth watering (and melting) biscuit. The biscuit is so much better than something out of KFC but I am sure they used so much more butter! The chicken was crispy and the meat was so moist! The skin was not a thick load of batter like some fried chicken can get and the spice was just right.   Till next time, Bojangles!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Service was pretty mediocre-waited 5 minutes for someone to come to the register & even acknowledge me. Cajun filet biscuit was decent but nothing special. They did have Cheerwine so that was a plus! It did the job but I wouldn't make a point to come back. Note-some of the reviews are referencing the airport. I think that's a mistake. This location is near but not in the airport."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or your gas. My poor husband waited 45 min and the order was wrong. Not the first time. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I will give one star for being open. I purchased a chicken biscuit this morning from the drive through. When I arrived at work and ate my biscuit I was very disappointed to say the least. Biscuit was very dry and hard and tasted like it was a day old which I think it was because it wasn't over cooked. When it was cooked it wasn't in the oven long enough to get brown on top. The chicken breast also tasted like yesterday's left overs."}
{"text":"This fast food chain serves the best priced and best tasting breakfast foods HANDS DOWN! Take your pick from sandwiches, bo rounds, anything on the menu really. One of my favorites is the bo berry biscuit... it's almost too good!"}
{"text":"It's place it's delicious, the chicken tenders tasted amazing, they have an option of dipping sauce of Ranch, BBQ, Honey Mustard. The fries tasted fresh and the biscuit tasted home made adding the honey or butter made it better :) I would recommend this place to anyone hungry and waiting for the next flight out. Place is great too bad the customer service is not as good as the food. A lot of atti"}
{"text":"Put green beans upside down in a paper bag, then handed it to me. It all fell on my shoes. Now I am looking forward to a terrible flight with green bean juice soaking my feet.   Plus: The lady then proceeded to give me a new batch of food in a plastic bag, then said \"Be careful.\""}
{"text":"WTF Bojangles... There needs to be some hiring going on here. It's Saturday morning and you all obviously don't have any order with your restaurant. I waited in line at the drive thru for 18 mins (and I only waited this lonh because I was on the phone which distracted my time) before I decided to leave. The parking lot was full and so was the drive thru smh get some help or continue to lose business"}
{"text":"If i could give this less then one star, I would. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced; not just at a Bojangles, but at any fast-food restaurant. My family and I 'dined in' and we might as well have ordered to go. There was no food ready (there were customers in front of us and behind) when we arrived to the counter to order. You would think there were no customers waiting. The staff was AWFUL. They did not make any effort to speed up the process to make more chicken, biscuits, fries, etc. Everyone was just standing around. None of the staff looked any one (including myself) in the eyes once from what I could see. This was my third time going to this Bojangles (I am from out of town) and all three experiences were a complete waste of time. I told myself after this go-around, I REFUSE to go back there."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service.  Window staff is beyond the worst.  No smiles no hellos no thank you's.  food is going downhill too. They all need to go to chikfila training!!"}
{"text":"The food was not to bad but the place was not very clean and a bit scary. There was a homeless man who came in and refuded to leave and a nice manager gave him money to buy food ,that was the best part of the visit. I kind of felt like a was walking into a family situations as all the customers seemed to know the staff and were walking in and out"}
{"text":"The concept of a drive through oven chicken for breakfast establishment was almost a complete culture shock for me.  Who puts chicken tenders in the oven and roasts them up for breakfast?  It's Bojangles, we do!  It wasn't breakfast it was freakfest.  Food was good, but a little bit out of the ordinary.   The vats of sweetened and unsweetened ice teas were sort of ordinary vs. other drinks I have had but at least it was fresh and not foul.  They appear to not believe in ketch-up here YET. But boy do they love their cherry pop. I mean soda, but they refer to it as their pop. Cherry pop that tastes like toothpaste.   Yea! Next time I'll just be having water. And maybe invest in my own ketch-up.   Mad props for the FREE WIFI. my QWERTY now has more than a little bit of complimentary chicken grease on it. Probably was a good thing they didn't have ketch-up, or else my laptop would be having it."}
{"text":"I love Bojangles chicken. I used to eat this all the time back in the day when I was growing up my buddy Chris Aunt work there and she would always bring us home some.

{"text":"Thanks for the wait time of 12 minutes in the drive thru line. This place was great when it first opened but over the past 2 years or so it has become the worst place to get food from. Maybe the owner should look at the satisfaction of the customers and reevaluate his staff.  You'll get NO more business from this Bojangles connoisseur I'll change my route to go by another Bojangles to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever with any other Bojangles. Visited 2 times in 3 days, no mash potatoes! Ordered a 12 piece meal and a half gallon of tea, and when I got home and opened the box there was pink lemonade with an ice tea sticker. I called to complain, and nothing was done to resolve my complaint, other than saying the next time I come, there will be mash potatoes. I don't think there will be a next time. Paid over $32 there and I could have gone to an appreciative resteraunt."}

{"text":"$1.77 to feed a child was the attraction.  Bojangles is celebrating their anniversary with insanely low throwback Thursday prices. $1.77 for a two-piece with a side??? Yes! Good idea until I hit the drive-thru line. This location is notoriously slow! Customer service is at a mediocre level at best. Even for a \"less expensive\" meal, I still expect customer service. Tip-go inside if you visit this location. You might have better luck.   Food was decent, what you expect from \"the Bo\"."}
{"text":"Ohhh heck yes for the 6am Bojangles chicken breakfast sammich combo before a long, direct flight to SFO!   I've had my eye on Bojangles this year when visiting Charlotte. Sadly, the timing wasn't right to try it out on the last visit. Thank me now for sparing you the gory details. So color me thrilled when I discovered they served chicken breakfast meals right at the airport.   After ordering, I found a table to the side. There I pieced out my sammich and enjoyed slicing up the chicken fillet to devour and savor bite by bite. It was super tasty, crispy, fresh and moist. Delightful! Then I ketchup'd up my tater rounds...those were gone almost instantly. And finally, finally...spread a couple of packs of honey on the hot, flakey tastylicious bisquit.   Man...my stomach is excited just thinking about it. Breathe. Breathe. Okay, then all washed down with the sweetest of sweet tea!!!                                                         Ahhhh Yeah!!!   As you might imagine, this location is super busy....yet the employees are kind and friendly--even  at the crack of dawn. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location a couple times in the morning during the week. They're always fast (I go around 7am) and friendly. Today I received the wrong order and promptly called when I got home and I spoke to Ms. Sharon, she apologized and then resolved the matter. I NEVER experienced subpar service at this location and I feel the employees go above and beyond. I will bypass other Bojangles to get to this one."}
{"text":"Poor English language from Drive-Thru attendants. At the end of the order they say, \"Is that all you want?\" -- waiting in line at Drive-Thru for 30 minutes!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn decent for airport food! Grouchy, hungry and missed flight makes one hard to please customer. Chicken tenders were surprisingly better than my wings. Tenders had a really good crunch and good spice in the batter. Chicken wings were too thickly battered for my tastes. Biscuit looked crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside sadly, it looked better than it tasted. If you're stuck at this airport you could do worst."}
{"text":"Just spent 16 minutes in the drive-through trying to get breakfast. They were putting through one car at a time: take order, take money, cook food, deliver food, take next order. When I got to the window, she asked, \"what was your order again?\" Completely unacceptable for a drive-through service."}
{"text":"This Bojangles location has to be the absolute worst service ever.  I don't live far so I've gone more than a few times - and they have NEVER gotten my order correct.  EVER.  It doesn't matter how simple the order may be - you always end up with something missing and usually something added you didn't order.   Example - just last week I ordered: 2 boberry biscuits 1 plain biscuit  1 large order of botato-rounds.   I got: 2 Boberry Biscuits  2 plain biscuits  No botato-rounds    Before then - Ordered: 4 Biscuits 1 side of Mac and cheese  Got: 5 Biscuits 1 chicken tender (1???) 1 Mashed potato and gravy  There is some lack of communication between the person who takes your order in the drive thru and the employees who put together the meals. They just can't seem to get it right.  I've gotten in the habit of pulling around the front, checking the food, only to have to go in and ask for whatever was missing.  I've seen multiple others have to do the same thing.   If there were another location as convenient I would never return to this location.  I may not return anyway as I'm sick of dealing with the staff."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have a layover right next to this place. I have never been to North Carolina, but I want to go back if this is anything like the food offerings available I had the Cajun chicken biscuit and it was delicious. It was clearly fatty and totally bad for you (but what else would you expect?), but it was crunchy, hot, spicy, and the chicken was moist. I want another one right now. It was very good. This is definitely a great option if you're ever in this airport."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru in the whole world. But typical for the entire Bojangles chain. Terrible service."}
{"text":"You know what. It's no KFC.  It seemed like a must try (!!!) considering the line at 630am, but it was such a disappointment.  The chicken is dry.. the biscuit was meh.. the sweet tea was just syrup over ice! I had to dump half of it and add water, and still - almost all of it ended up in the trash.  I really really wanted to like you. More so, cause I talked myself into getting fried chicken situation at 630am. Will not be making a stop here during my next layover - I'm sorry!"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders and biscuits were delicious!! I got the mac n cheese for a side and it was cold! Overall, I would go back."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times, and wait is consistently slow. Food is good overall, but inconsistent too. They need to do something about the wait, it's a little ridiculous at times.  Edit - we waited over an hour for our order. It was during Throwback Thursday, but everyone else was getting their boxes. Even after something was said.  This location needs to do better with being prepared for high volume."}
{"text":"So at first I thought it would be a dry biscuit but soon as I opened the package I could tell it was soft and would be good. I ordered a Cajun chicken biscuit and hash browns and it was all pretty good. It give it a solid 4 for a fast food spot."}
{"text":"The chicken is good...nothing special unless you ask them to throw your piece back into the grease again (which they will) so that it can be extra crispy...if you have the time.  I usually get the Chicken Strips Supreme (which comes with a biscuit and side) or a Cajun Chicken Biscuit.  You can order biscuits anytime throughout the day.  I'm not a fan of their Bo Rounds (circle shaped Hash browns) b/c I find that they taste like old grease every time.  My BF is a fan of their Bo Berry Biscuits (with extra glaze...I know I know he doesn't really count calories...lucky him {insert rolling my eyes here}) and it seems like my coworkers are too b/c someone is always bringing them to one of our breakfast/lunch events.  Not much to mention...all of them to me have been about the same.  Decent service (sometimes they can be on the slow side), the eating area seems to be clean, and the prices are decent.  something quick and decent if you don't feel like frying chicken yourself..."}
{"text":"This is a local chain with an outlet right inside the Charlotte Convention Center.  I like their chicken tenders and fries.  They've got a slight kick of Cajun spice to both.  The huge negative to this location is that they have difficulty dealing with a crowd -- like you might find at a convention center.  The line can become nearly unbearable at peak hours.  However, they have a simple saving grace.  Unlike a lot of food concessions inside convention centers and airports, the prices aren't significantly higher than they would be outside of the venue.  Long story short, it's worth a visit if you can sneak away from your convention at a different time from everyone else's breaks."}
{"text":"You can't tune in a Charlotte radio or drive on a Charlotte highway without hearing or reading about \"It's Bo-time!\". I don't usually let advertising sway me, but I wanted a quick lunch and I wasn't particularly concerned about healthy. I mean, you'd have to be an idiot to think that fried chicken is anything other than grease that cooks out any of the goodness of a chicken breast.  This Bojangles (I like to pronounce it \"Bo-hang-gless\") is around the corner from my office and sort of on the way home, so I opted to pop in and sit down so that I could carefully consider the meal in its proper environment. It was what it was. A very large chicken breast with a fluffy biscuit and decent sized servings of \"dirty rice\" and mac-and-cheese. The chicken was a little greasy but I did find a good amount of meat under the battering. The rice wasn't that special. The mac-and-cheese, on the other hand, was really good. Sharp cheesy flavor, I also hit it with some of their spicy Cajun sauce for a little kick.  The restaurant itself is in a food-court style eatery with some other places in here if you're with others and looking to get meals from different establishments. Free wi-fi worked well and the TV's provided a useful distraction.  About once every two years or so, I try some fried chicken and it reminds me of why I don't do this more often."}
{"text":"You might not be aware, but Bojangles is based right here in Charlotte and so this location is quite the flagship to introduce this fabulous chicken to people who otherwise might not be able to experience it.  This one is located by gate B9 and there is a small seating area nearby. Do your fellow passengers a big favor and PLEASE DO NOT BRING FRIED CHICKEN ON THE PLANE. Sure, it tastes great for you, but the smell carries for miles and miles. So yes, get some of this great stuff. And then eat it in the airport!  Okay, enough ranting. I got a simple platter with a breast and a wing plus mashed potatoes and cole slaw. I'm not going to have their mac & cheese in the airport, but at the retail outlets, it's okay. The chicken was quite moist but there was a lot of batter. The fixin's were okay. Nothing special  I can't say that I'm blown away by Bojangles, but it's one of those things that I generally have about once a year.  For a laugh, pronounce it \"Bo-HANG-glaze\"."}
{"text":"Mostly, this Bojangles irritates me. It's the entrance and the exit with a steep ramp to the sidewalk and so drivers slow down to a snail's pace to turn in or exit. You're driving an SUV! You can drive over a bump!  Anyway, I was just at the drive through today and got a quick bite. Bojangle's sweet tea is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I can only give this location 1 star.  When I pulled up behind another car to place an order, I could see there were cars lined up to get to the window.  After placing my order, it was over five minutes before the first car pulled away from the window with food.  I could see they had ordered the big box (family meal) but that's no excuse.  There were two more cars ahead of me, so I had to leave.  My daughter had to eat something else..."}
{"text":"First visit to this new location.  Service in the drive-thru was slow to say the least.  We began looking at each other thinking, it's time to go!  Once I got up to the window, I was informed that the Bo-berry bisquits the kids wanted would take about 4 minutes.  At this point, I was not pleased because I waited over 4 minutes in the drive-thru line.  I had to pull all the way around to the front door and waited at least 4 minutes for them to bring out my order."}
{"text":"It's Bo Time when the little one has to have it!  I stopped by this location to get her favorite, the chicken supreme meal.  Service was quick and friendly and the food was hot.  She was happy and that makes me happy!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints.  This location has been open for a few weeks now and I just got around to check it out.  It is a beautiful facility with a 100.5 rating which is always a good thing.  The -piece chicken finger meal with fries and sweet tea is the staple in my house so that was was on the menu today.  The tea and chicken were pretty good.  The fries were hot and fantastic!  The biscuit, well, it could have been hot then it would have tasted great.   It is great to have another Bojangles in the Huuntersville location!"}
{"text":"I was going to skip the review of this restaurant as I only stopped here because my child was 'starving'.  There was one car at the window waiting for food and another one at the speaker to order.  I was glad this would not be a long wait.  I was wrong.  My child was 'starving' so I waited.  I waited at least 5 minutes before moving up (I did not check the clock).  When I got up to the speaker, I stated the order twice, a chicken tenders meal with sweat tea and a large fry.  I was asked for the yet order again.  After repeating it a third and fourth time, I finally got to move up to the window but had to wait a few more minutes for the car in front of me to move up while waiting for their order to be delivered from inside.  This guy didn't want to move up - I could not reach the window.  When Bonkiesha (her name is on the receipt) yelled at him to move up, he finally did.  Okay, so here's what I got... warm chicken tenders with warm fries and a Pepsi (vs. sweet tea) and the large order of fries was so cold, it was ridiculous.  Was I wrong to think they were cooking the food while I was waiting?  Yes, I was!  What makes fast-food restaurants think you want cold fries?  I mean really; I can get a frozen bag at the supermarket and throw them in the oven.  I was so disgusted, I pulled off with EVERY intention to never stop at this location again.  I thought the renewed energy of JCSU on this block would warrant an improved fast-food restaurant but that was wrong assumption on my part."}
{"text":"Our flight from LA to Pittsburgh had a layover in Charlotte, North Carolina.  We had about an hour to wait, and I decided to get a snack as dinner in Pittsburgh was going to be late.  I saw a bright yellow sign that said \"Bojangle's chicken\".  There's no Bojangle's in California (or not to my knowledge) so I ordered a 4-piece snack chicken tenders with a small season fries.  The snack came with their famous biscuits.  The chicken was tender inside, crispy outside but a bit salty.  For airport food, I really couldn't complain abut the taste or the price.  Thumbs up for me, and as Michelle P said, if the airport food was pretty tasty, I can only imagine what an actual location would be."}
{"text":"Delayed 5 1/2 hours at Charlotte Airport, I stopped to have my first Bojangles Chicken and Biscuits with Dirty Rice as my side. Have to say, it looked like Popeye's Chicken but it was surprisingly better. Chicken was tender and moist under that crust, and dirty rice was tasty too. Not dried out. Seasoned just right. I'm sold. Good chicken and dirty rice, and at an airport location! Will definitely eat Bojangles again."}
{"text":"Worse drive through every time i go. So i just won't go anymore. I love Bojangles but won't go here anymore."}
{"text":"The chicken was dry and tuff.  It tasted like it had been reheated. The fries were the same."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would . Spent 25 bucks for breakfast for family and they totally got the order wrong. Caked to speak to manager got hung up on.. won't ever go back"}
{"text":"This is the WORST bojangles I have ever been to. Staff sucks, my order here has never been right and have given this place a \"second\" chance plenty of times. My past orders and the customer service is so consistently terrible I blame the management."}
{"text":"Did a fly-by here during a very brief layover recently. The fries were good and the chicken smelled evenly, altho I can't eat it. We ordered large drinks and they gave us regular, but given our 20 minute run to our jetway we couldn't really complain."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Bojangles. I usually have a strong liking towards fried chicken but it wasn't that great. I prefer KFC over this."}
{"text":"Service here has continued to decline for months. I usually stop here each morning for breakfast on the way to my office. Several times, the wait in the drive through line has been +30 minutes. One time I decided to go inside to pick up my food because the drive through line had been so slow recently - it took me 45 minutes to get two sausage biscuits. One of the managers was behind the counter packing food and couldn't keep up. People were just coming to the counter and complaining that they had been waiting forever and he would find their order to fill it first. Some of these people came in after me. Today, there is a sign on the door stating that because of limited staff, there dining room is closed but you can go through the drive through. So far 10 minutes in the drive thru line and i still haven't made it to the menu board. Something has got to give with this place.  UPDATE: Made it to the speaker - there is another sign saying their drive through speaker is broken and you need to order at the window."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm missing something, but I found nothing good about dried up chicken fingers and a overcookrd biscuit that tasted like old grease.    I will definitely stick to popeyes for my chicken."}
{"text":"I hate this bojangles more than anything lol. Worst bojangles no worst fast food place I've ever been to. Something about the people that work here. They are lazy, rude as hell. They always make u wait when u pull up to order at the microphone for some ridiculous period of time. My boyfriend refuses to use this bojangles and even my friends complain about it when they are in the area. Management u better get it together because ur team is horrible."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this location for lunch. Their breakfast is usually pretty good, but after visiting this afternoon, I won't be returning to this location. I went through the drive through and ordered a Cajun Filet sandwich. When I received my food, the cashier at the window wasn't very friendly. He took my payment and handed me my food without a simple \"Thank you\". After trying my food, I noticed that the cajun filet wasn't very fresh. It was kind of crunchy and wasn't warm at all. It tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. I walked inside to notify management and they gave me a replacement sandwich. I still had the same problem. The meat was room temperature and tasted old. I was issued a refund and sent a complaint to corporate."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good biscuits... Didn't get to try lunch.....  NY is missing out on these southern food chains."}
{"text":"Ok. This is my first time to the new Bo! The place is modern and southern. Just what the Bo needed! This concept should serve Bo well going forward."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this less than one star. Ive always loved Bojangles, but don't come here. Awful service, workers are rude and careless. The past three times I've been I was very disappointed. Asked for honey mustard, the lady ignored me and I didn't get any at all. The sandwich I got was wrong and slapped together in a messy fashion with some sort of ranch or something instead of mayo(which is what the sandwich is supposed to come with). Another time I ordered a sausage and egg biscuit and it had no sausage on it. No straw or napkins were ever put in the bag. AWFUL establishment. Seems like they need a whole new staff honestly. Will never be back. Disappointed that Bojangles has gone so downhill."}
{"text":"I love this place. Honestly the service here is always wonderful. While I love this chain getting great service at a fast food chain is refreshing. They always keep fresh food to. I have never had a meal that tasted dry, or a few hours old.   Great Location!!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Food is always fine, and the crew are nice, but they do not hustle or prepare for the daily lunch rush."}
{"text":"Wow. The best Bojangles location I have visited. Staff was friendly, courteous and the location was very clean. The food was hot and fresh. Keep up the good work managers."}
{"text":"Was in the vicinity and based on many of the favorable reviews - decided to give it a try. Ordered the Chicken Cajun Sandwich Combo, upsized it. Got the seasoned fries, which were very tasty and they were quite liberal with the seasonings. The sandwich was pretty good and tasty (had mayo, lettuce and tomato). Next time I would try the other choices as well. Certainly very filling and would visit again"}
{"text":"Today is officially my last day coming to this bojangles locations when I say they are extremely slow it's no way in sam you know what in the mornings the lines should be this long and this slow I decided I will give them one more chance but this is the last chance one chance too many bye bye to this location they move like molasses in here !"}
{"text":"As previous reviews have said, the absolute worst service ever. I just left there.  Took twenty minutes to get a sandwich going through drive thru, and there where that many cars their.  I'll not be going back"}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed! The service was good...that's about it. The chicken sandwhich tasted like it had been left out a while before it was cooked...definitely not fresh! Their mashed potatos were good although they served it with sausage gravy which was unique.  The cost was ok. Typical chicken place. The (women's) restroom wasn't cleaned very well and neither was the restaurant. Trying to find a clean table was not hard... only one amongst several messy tables.  The only plus to the restaurant was the servers. They had smiles and treated us well.  It was the first Bojangles I've been to and I was not impressed in the least."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Bojangles and I wasn't necessarily impressed.  The first strike against them is that this location is inside the airport.  They ran low on chicken breast and/or thighs, so we waited over 15 minutes for our food.  Although the skin was nice and crispy and the meat was juicy, I would rather have the skin/batter seasoned, which is why I'm more partial to Popeye's or KFC."}
{"text":"The manager was the nicest lady I have ever had to great me at a fast food restaurant. She was very generous and represented Bojangles very well."}
{"text":"Came here ordered two roasted chicken bite combos. Drove back home to realize items were missing and no napkins or forks in the bag. Arrived back and was told I had to wait in line because the doors were locked. So inconsiderate. I was already at an inconvenience having to drive back here and to have to wait behind others placing orders is ridiculous. Customer service isn't important apparently!"}
{"text":"Food: Mediocre overpriced airport fried chicken. Avoid. Maybe go find chik fil a.  Service: fast.  Atmosphere: it's next to gate B9 at the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"Worst customer service every time I come!  It literally never fails! I'm never greeted to begin with. It will take min 20mins just to get through the drive thru! You're then told to pull up and have to wait an extra 10mins just for your food to come out."}
{"text":"Since the Bojs in Midtown was closed, this location was a short drive away to get our Boj fix.  Went through the drive-thru, but the staff was nice and patient since it took a while deciding on what to stuff our faces with.  It was late in the evening (8:30ish) but the biscuits were still fresh and the chicken was just what we needed.  The fries that came with my cajun fillet biscuit were just what I wanted.  This location has the perfect seasoning/fry ratio that makes you sad when you reach the bottom of the bag and see that you are all out in about 5 seconds.  I do have a special place in my heart for Popeye's, but living \"down south\" I have definitely come to love the tradition that is Bojangles."}
{"text":"I will always have a special place in my heart for Boj...  That being said, it was really sad to see the location on the corner of Independence and Idlewild Rd get torn down, but it may have been a blessing since they got to build a much newer/better version a little bit down the road.  Same old chicken goodness is still here... the only downside with all the Independence \"improvements\", this Bojangles is basically accessible to the outbound side of Independence Blvd.  Once the bus lane is completed, you will probably have to make a bunch of U-turns and or travel on down the road to the next exchange to turn around and gain access.  Seems like this new location is targeting the drive-thru crowd since there are less parking spaces than the other location, but it won't be a problem since they are on the edge of that Kaplan school /formerly Circuit City that has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is a well-kept and clean Bojangles.  It's always my go to on the weekends versus the other Bojs locations that I could go to.  The lines move fast [if there is ever a line] and the food comes out nice and hot.  Usually just grab biscuits here... haven't been here for lunch so I don't know if their quality drops [but I don't think it does].  You can tell the Bojangles ship is run tight here with the employees being very friendly and everything always in the right place."}
{"text":"Because of all the road construction on Independence Blvd the Bo's at Idlewild road was forced to close. But Bo's built this new restaurant just down the road.  It's a typical Bo's. Walk in place your order, move down the line to get your order and drinks. The dining room is your average size Bo's. Nothing that really stands out here.  The food is fresh and always consistent which is what counts. And Bo's makes the best biscuit sandwiches that tops the rest of the fast food joints.    Customer service is ok definitely not the best, but not the worst either."}
{"text":"Bojangles is one of those things you don't know you love until it's gone. Growing up in the Northeast we did not have Bojangles. When I go back home to visit and it's no longer an option is usually when I crave Bojangles fried southern deliciousness the most. Everything is fried, greasy, buttery - delicious!  When I hit up Bojangles for breakfast I always go for the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits. Bojangles has earned that biscuit making crown and they wear it proudly. The biscuits are always perfect. I also like the bo-berry biscuit or cinnamon pecan twist both drizzled with sweet icing. The bo-rounds are okay - but I've had better hashbrowns.   Lunch and dinner - I try to stick to the grilled chicken sandwich with seasoned fries. I always ask for a side of honey mustard to dip my fries and sandwich in. They have the BEST honey mustard.   The drive-thru system is so old and outdated. I can NEVER understand what the people are saying here. The first time I ever ordered here I had to ask the girl 3 times what she was saying before finally just telling her I would come around the window. I always make my roommate go/order for us because she seems to speak Bojangles fluently. They do not have a screen where your order pops up to make sure they have everything right. They have messed up my order before (which reading these reviews on here seems to be the norm more than the exception)."}
{"text":"I never really craved Fried Chicken, back when I was a West Coast, health conscious gal. That is until I discovered the spicy, crispy, juicy goodness of Bojangles fried chicken.   They don't have these out west, so I didn't know what to expect. There is almost always a well-valued special. This location is very clean and looks relatively new.   First off, I never expect bright-eyed, smiling service at fast food places, but this Bojangles was a pleasant surprise. Ever-so polite, prompt and friendly, the staff at the counter, managers in the kitchen and the folks at the to go window are always cheerful. There is definitely something to be said for the management at this location or region. It's not uncommon to see a manager walk out to deliver food to a table, drop bo-rounds into a fryer or set the pace.   The food here is dependable, usually pretty fresh and a bargain. They also have Wi-fi here which is pretty cool. Breakfast is awesome, bo-rounds are irresistible, and chicken is spicy. It will satisfy your fried chicken craving and have you licking your fingers and picking at the bones. What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit. Especially when something or someone wins me over. I don't stray from my favorites.  I've been to this bojangles countless times. Even more than my check-ins show because there have been plenty of times I was in a rush to get in and out and didn't worry about checking in.  However on my last visit over a month ago... I went through the drive-thru and the lady had a difficult time hearing me. So when I pulled up to the window, I kindly asked her what my order was. Who can blame me for wanting to make sure she heard me?   But apparently she was too busy to tell me because she simply stated two combos and closed the drive-thru windows on me. So when she opened up the windows again, I asked if she could tell me what combos I had and she simply told me whatever the meat was and shut the doors. So by this time, I am livid. She is completely aloof and treating me like I am giving her a difficult time. As a customer, I just wanted to ensure that she heard me correctly. So she finally told me my sides and they were not correct. Her behavior only got worse and I informed her that her customer service skills were lacking. She simply stated that is just the way she talks and again shut the window on me. That was it for me. I asked for the manager and this person that they allowed to deal with customers had someone come to the window who wasn't a manager, pretend to be a manager.  So I calmly said he wasn't the manager and wanted the manager, so they sent someone else up pretending to be a manager. And every time the window was shut, I could just hear talking smack about me. I told her, I can hear you. So instead of arguing with her, I just told her I would call corporate.  If I hadn't been on a time crunch, I would have went inside to talk to the manager but I had to get back to work. I tried to be nice and call the store direct but no one answered the phone. After a few attempts of calling the store, I finally called corporate.  I have never done this but I was mad. I get we all have bad days and whatnot but to send two people that are not managers to the window is NOT acceptable.  So I called corporate and the guy who took my phone call was polite enough. Apologized and everything. Maybe I just expect too much. He did tell me that they were going to forward my complaint to upper management but I guess I expected some kind of follow up. I mean he took my phone number, my email address, my home address. Why take all this information if you are not going to do anything with it.  So needless to say, I haven't been back to this Bojangles or any since then. I waited a while to update this review because I was waiting for the opportunity of a follow up from Bojangles.  I may be one customer only but every customer should matter just the same."}
{"text":"Worst bojangles ever..20 minute wait After  ordering and he gave us the wrong food. Wrapped in a napkin. Get it together bojangles"}
{"text":"Friendly. Delicious fried-chicken I have been craving for some time now. It is my first time to try their chicken. I would go back in a heart beat! I am hoping they expand towards the mid-atlantic and northeast regions!"}
{"text":"Seriously. Dumbest human beings alive. They could not comprehend anything about taking, putting together and serving anything. If I could give them negative stars I would.  Bojangles HQ needs to seriously re-train and re-staff this location."}
{"text":"The hubby and kid asked me to stop by Bojangles and bring them some chicken and sweet tea home. I'm a southern girl, so I was most definitely down. I got a 8 piece tailgate with a side of cold slaw and cajun beans. The meal came with ice tea and I got three sweet potatoe pies. I went around lunchtime, and there was a little line of 5 cars in front of me. The staff was really friendly? at the drive thru. The smell was heavenly on the ride home. I have to say that they got it right! The chicken and sides were great! The tea was not too sweet, it was perfect. The biscuits were not doughie at all. One of the sweet potatoe pies was a little burnt, but that was ok, because my husband said it was good. I'd I could get this kind of service every time I went, I would most definitely go frequently...I want to say, \"Keep up the good work Bojangles!\""}
{"text":"We don't have Bojangles in MA.  It was right between my gates on my layover.   Chicken biscuit for lunch and one for the flight.  WINNING"}
{"text":"I have worked for Bojangles for 7 yrs before I left and this store was the last one I was at. I can honestly say that they have change so much since I left about 3 years ago. Everyone that i worked with have left. The store manager and managers seem like they don't give a care in the world about the food or the service they give.  Every time I go to this location it take's them forever to give you your food, and when they do it's always with a stink face. Like they don't want to work. On top of that the food be old and really greasy and my order is always wrong. If they run out legs or wing they don't even ask you would you like to replace it, they just throw whatever they have. And every time i get a family meal my sides be wrong and my half gallon tea be unsweet when i tell them sweet. Plus It's no use to complain to the manager they won't fix it. It seem as if the crew members  runs the restaurant.   I hope the head office fix these issue not only at this location but in all there stores before it's to late. The bad part is this is a cropate own store.   The only reason why I still eat there is because of my kids besides that I wouldn't go. And this is literally 5 mins away."}
{"text":"The ham and biscuit sandwich is horrible and need to be take off the market. The people's money need to be refunded its too salty. We were so disappointed when we had to get this on our layover and had to get directly on the plane."}
{"text":"I go here some mornings before work. No complaints. The new \"BoJo\" isn't bad for fast food coffee. Always have been fast, friendly and tasty."}
{"text":"This place looks questionable but seriously this is a well run bojangles. They don't judge I'm writing this in their bathroom right now after a night of drinking hoping to get something greasy for my stomach. This bathroom is so clean I was annoyed I had to use a public restroom but this one is great"}
{"text":"Food was good as is typical of most Bojangles. It took a while to get the food the the lady on duty was friendly so it wasn't too bad. Someone started cleaning the lobby but I guess when they got busy they left the broom and dust pan in the lobby."}
{"text":"During a delayed layover at the Charlotte airport, my fella and I decided to grab a snack while we waited for our flight. We ordered a cajun filet biscuit and a chicken leg to share. I have heard about Bojangles, but never came across one in my travels until yesterday.   The biscuit and chicken were very tasty. The sandwich had the right amount of spice and the chicken was extremely moist and the portions were great. The filet was really meaty and juicy. The chicken leg was also moist and flavorful. Definitely a nice little stop if you're in the area. I hadn't planned on eating during my wait, but after seeing everyone sitting around me with a Bojangles box, I just couldn't resist the enchanting call of the siren."}
{"text":"Today I went to this location at 10:53 am, upon arrival there is 9 or more cars in the drive thru, so I went in.  I was third in line and when I got to the manager Christi, who was not wearing a name tag I asked for my regular supreme combo no biscuit replace them with extra fries.  I have not ever had a problem with this order. She replied she can't do it but she can switch it out for a Bo berry biscuit because of cost.  So I ordered it regular and asked her who is the district manager, she gave two names, then I asked her why was the line backed up and she replied they can tell you.   I then asked her what is her name she began laughing I completed the transaction with her and went to wait for my food, after 5 minutes I received food the guy boxing was very courteous and even apologized for the delay, but the beginning was enough to stop me from giving this location any money.  The positive on this complaint is the guy boxing the food is better at customer service than Christi the manager."}
{"text":"BoJo's, yeah!  I love it when you watch a Panthers game, the camera pans over to Jerry Richardson in the owners booth, there he is drinking a large BoJo's sweet tea."}
{"text":"When you get to Bo's country you got to get a steak biscuit and some of the legendary sweet tea.  I liked when the lady at the register saw my AF Vet hat & said you get the VIP discount....on the coffee!"}
{"text":"This is an easy on/off exit from I-77.  I've received good service either walking in or going through the drive through. There coffee is good and I especially like the breakfast combo deal, I like the bo rounds!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in my experience here in the drive thru. The steak biscuit I ordered was dry and the meat was dryer.  I wanted splenda and I got regular sugar for my coffee. It was luke warm and by the time you get down the road you're not going to stop and turn around."}
{"text":"If you want chicken in and around Lake Norman, go to KFC or better yet, Lowes grocery. If you want biscuits. Go to Hardees. Bojangles is an ok substitute on either end. What I wouldn't give to replace every Bojangles in town with a Popeye's though."}
{"text":"Private parking lot Drive thru, long line Dine in This location is hit or miss on service and quality of food.  There is a really good manager and one that doesn't care. This was a second incident of where I went inside to order, no wait, people behind me, but I'm the last to leave.  They do not fill orders as FIFO it's fill what order they want to first. Because I was over looked several times, I did get fresh food to fill my simple 2 piece meal. The cashier was new and hesitate when entering order.  I should have stayed in the drive thru, because they went faster than the manager preparing orders inside."}
{"text":"Pretty good cajun chicken sandwich for breakfast but a little bit greasy."}
{"text":"I feel like as a customer going through a drive-through fast food chain, I should've gotten my food in less than 10 minutes. That was not my case today. I had to wait 20 minutes for two cars in front of me to get their food and the guy in front of me even left without taking his order!  When I finally pulled up to the window, the employee was acting so flustered and then gave me my order with no apology. I asked for honey mustard and he said they were all out of honey mustard. My food wasn't even that great so I don't understand what took them so long.  The customer service was just not up to par for what you should be doing it at fast food chain. I comprehend the mechanisms of being rushed, something going awry, and becoming flustered. That doesn't mean you should stop giving amazing service and apologizing. I almost left without paying and just driving straight food without getting my food because I was so angry and hungry.  Looking at the reviews on yelp I'm not surprise that I had a horrible experience. You really should step it up Bojangles.  I don't like to take time out of my day to write a shitty review but this needs to be addressed."}
