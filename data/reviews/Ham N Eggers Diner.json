{"text":"Great food, bacon is awesome.  Frittatas and kielbasa breakfast sandwich are a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"I've always drove by saying, \"That place looks good to try sometime\". My father-in-law and I stopped by for brunch, excellent decision. Overall, great atmosphere with attentive and polite staff. You get a decent amount of food for the price. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The service was bad. The hostess and waitress kept forgetting things and barely checked on you even though they were not that busy. The food itself was just okay.Things were missing from our order like cheese & pickles on a sandwich, & salad dressing was forgotten and I was waiting around with a dry salad. And to top it off they charged $2 to bring a plate for my child. I get an extra plate at a lot of places and never have seen a fee. Take your chances anywhere else."}
{"text":"Eggs are smashing! I usually sit at the counter but it seems the closer to the kitchen the crabbier the server...maybe if we sat by the door it would make them happier? Don't know but if you're looking for a little cheer with your eggs then this ain't the place."}
{"text":"We decided to take my dad to Kennywood for Father's Day and so I searched Yelp to find a diner and I came across this place and decided to give it a try. The entire brunch process took two hours and some of the food was not that great. My dad ordered sausage and when he mentioned to the waitress that it was thin and hard she told everything can't be good when a cook calls off on Father's Day."}
{"text":"I'm not picky when it comes to food. I'll eat pretty much anything. But I don't appreciate being misled.

I only get corned beef hash when a place makes it, not heats up the sodium bomb that comes out of a can and looks and smells like dog food. So I was kinda excited when I saw their Hot Hash Skillet featured, \"Our homemade corn beef hash mixed with potato and onions topped with 2 eggs your way and a choice of toast.\" 

So imagine my disappointment when I receive what amounts to the canned corn beef hash mixed in with home fries. See the photo. 

If corned beef hash is on a menu, I usually ask if it's the canned crap. If they say yes, I decline and get something else. When the menu says homemade, I don't think I should have to ask if it comes out of a can. I assume it's made on premises.

If you really want corned beef hash made right, go to Drew's in Forest Hills or Eggs R Us on Noblestown Road. These places actually make real corned beef hash. Don't get it here."}
{"text":"Ham n Eggers is the new replacement to the old Hot Metal Diner! Some of our favorite staff from the former location are still here, especially Donna!

We're so happy the location reopened under new ownership and name. The food is still good even if we miss the good old days here!

We'll be back many times again! Welcome back to this location!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on Mother's Day and were very pleased.    Seated quickly and brought strong coffee right away was a good start.   My husband had the French toast with ham and it was tasty, presented well and was a nice size portion.   I had the American Benedict, which was a toasted bagel topped with ham, scrambled egg and cheese and also served with home fries.   The food was served hot, tasted good and was extremely filling.

Our server checked back for coffee refills and brought our check in a timely manner.

The atmosphere is diner like and felt clean.   I liked the variety of colored plates and cups that were used.    The menu had a nice selection and the other plates I saw being served all looked yummy.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We come here EVERY Sunday.  Great food, nice staff. French toast made with wheat is great.  Chocolate chip waffle is to die for and Biscuits with Gravy are perfection.  Just need to be patient because they are usually very busy.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This breakfast was just what I needed. I had the corned beef hash with dippy eggs (over medium) It was sooooooo good the coffee was flame what else can you ask for?? I had some of my friends French toast it was good too. 3 meals and drinks for $40 check them out guys."}
{"text":"This used to be Hot Metal diner but the owner died and it changed management. Hot Metal was a great diner with great food.  At first the new owner tried to cut a few corners and tried to sell some inferior food but the customers let it be known that they would not come back unless the food went back to the way it had been.  So, now the good food is back.  My favorite thing to eat is \"The Usual\".  It is two eggs,  home fries, bacon, and toast.  They have several breakfast meats to choose from but I love their bacon.  It is thick sliced and cooled perfectly.  Recently I've asked to change out my home fries for a fruit cup.  The eggs are always fluffy.  I choose the Italian toast and it does not disappoint.  Occasionally to mix it up a little I will get the Rye bread which is also good.  The bread is always fresh and sliced on site.  You may have to wait for a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the food is like because they told us they were \"backed up,\" and didn't offer to let us wait for a table.  Interestingly, we noticed the people behind us got a table.  It was just my husband, daughter and me.  Pretty sure we looked and smelled ok since we had just come from church.  Weird."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the Hampton Inn and decided that we would rather have a full breakfast rather than the continental breakfast served at the hotel. 

It was one of the best decisions that we made that weekend!

The restaurant is nicely decorated, appears to be very clean and the tables are spaced apart comfortably. 

Service was very good and attentive. 

The menu is great. I ordered the French Toast and my wife had the Eggs Benedict. Both meals were excellent! The only mild disappointment was the decaf coffee, which was too strong.

Prices were very reasonable.

I wish we had a place like this near our home!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast mid morning.  I was here years ago when it was Hot Metal Diner and nothing seems to have changed except for the name, which is fine by me.  The breakfast options seem to be aimed at folks who have physically demanding jobs.  Everything was tasty, but I think loaded in butter and fat.  The home fries serving size looks to be a meal on it's own.  The prices are on the high side but if you can get here before 9am they have a good priced special. 

I substituted fruit for the home fries and am glad I did.  I also swapped out the bread for an English muffin. There was an upcharge for this and I don't think I would make that choice again.  The eggs were good as was the bacon.  Often I've found that thick bacon is chewy like jerky.  Not this bacon - it was crispy and flavorful, probably not as lean as at other places. I also sensed that there was sugar sprinkled on top.  

If you're looking for the diner experience, this is a good option. If you're looking for a lean, low fat meal then keep looking!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today. While we didn't exactly order what the name might suggest, we did both get a couple of their basic burgers, with fries for me and their chips for my buddy. I have stopped in once before and gotten breskfast, and as I recall, the omelet I had was great!
The server was polite and personable, the burger and fries were delivered promptly, hot and delicious! Coffee refills were offered, and the server kept checking on us.
The restaurant was clean and well-kept, and the men's room was also clean.
Good food, service, and reasonably priced!
All in all, great job! Try it; I think you'll like it!"}
{"text":"So glad they opened this dinner. It's not the same as the others around my area.  Unique good food that sets them apart.  I can't wait to come back soon.  Cooked perfectly and priced well."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place.  The food is prepared pretty well for how low quality the ingredients are.  Nothing is homemade....and I mean NOTHING, but they still do an ok job."}
