{"text":"Great value!  I have ordered from many other restaurants in the area but this one gives the most bang for your buck. The food was delivered in a timely manner and it was warm when it got here. The Roti is especially delicious and fresh. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes delicious Indian food at a great price! The vegetable and non veg thaali were great."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Strolled in here with a hungry friend at 9 pm on a Friday night. The place was empty but we were greeted by a very friendly man. We ordered:  2 Samosas 1 Butter chicken 1 Naan 1 Plain rice 1 Chicken Biryani  The food came within reasonable time and it was full of flavour and freshly made. I don't like butter chicken normally but I tried my friend's dish and it was divine. The samosas were nothing to write home about. The naan was fresh and the rice had just the right amount of heat (though you could get it even hotter).  I would definitely come here again. I am happy that they also do deliveries. I'll be ordering from here again.  p.s. We both had leftovers for lunch the next day. It was great!"}
{"text":"We had food delivered and the service was quick and courteous. If you like authentic Indian food you'll love Spice House - our meals were indeed spicy, favourful, and the portions were generous. I'll definitely order from here again."}
