{"text":"Do not waste your money. Came here on a glowing recommendation from my sister and brother in law, but sorely disappointed. I ordered the Coriander Shrimp (15.00) and Garlic Scallops (17.00) with a Coconut soup- all inedible. The shrimp dish was bland and greasy and the scallops tasted off and were rubbery. Soup, even worse. It tasted like someone dumped 1/2 a bottle of lime juice in coconut milk and called it a day.  $45.00 later, 9:25 pm, and starving."}
{"text":"Verry good true Thai food!"}
{"text":"Instead of trying the sushi buffet, we decided to try a Whitby regular. 
The place is casual and decorated with authentic Thai decoration. 

The food is \"Canadian\" Thai , including the price and quality, 
We ordered Pad Thai, curry chicken and basil beef. 
The price is quite high $14 for shrimp and pad Thai, with 3 shrimps. 
Their shrimps are good size ..The curry is okay but not spicy enough, 

The server is a sweet older lady. She is courteous and casual .. She reminds  me of a 5 and dime restaurant - hair piled on top with lots of blink. She is adorable and makes the dining experience an unique one ..

At the end of the Meal, the owner came around to serve some complimentary gelato , some thing they may start to sell in the summer. 

Overall 
Food - okay 
Ambiance - okay 
Service - pleasant 

I will come back again but only when I am not too hungry (smile)"}
{"text":"If you like great food and great people you need to come here and see james. He'll take care of you and make sure you dont leave hungary!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food could taste the individual flavours of all of the veggies and meat in the dishes. We had an array of things off the menu, everything was good. All decent portions. Mango salad was a delightful surprise. Owner came out to speak to our table, and the staff was very nice. All in all good experience."}
{"text":"It was absolutely horrible! I found a piece of STEEL in my noodles. They didn't even do anything about it. Some of the food was tasteless and hard. It was a horrible experience. After eating there my stomach didn't feel well either. Once again, I found a piece of STEEL in my food, and didn't receive an apology, this is unacceptable DO NOT COME HERE"}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed when we went the other night. We've been as a family a number of times over the years but the quality was quite poor the last couple times unfortunately. Meat dishes had very little meat and lots of filler veggies. Half the restaurant looks like a storage room. Hopefully they get back to their former glory."}
{"text":"Excellent and very flavourful food. Had spicy chicken pad Thai.   The cook brought Thai and peanut wings out for us to try and were they ever good.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Hidden amongst many chain restaurants and the Whitby 24 Cinema, a friend and I were both surprised on how good our dinner was here. The restaurant's pad tai and red curry, my barometer for judging a Thai restaurant, were really delicious. Having been in Thailand, it tasted as though it was made from scratch in a cast iron wok and layered with ingredients just as the vendors did it in Bangkok. It didn't taste pre-made or smothered in generic sauces and the noodles did not stick in a solid clump or drown in sticky liquid... yay! The pad tai dish was light and flavourful and even had a touch of grilled smokiness where the noodles hit warmer parts of the wok. Thank you for making me have hope for North American pad tai again. And the red curry was quite delicious as well. Lots of vegetables and plenty of chicken were in a slightly spicy curry sauce. Again, not to thick or watery. Just yummy. We had to order more rice because we did not want any to go to waste. So, if you are reading this, I hope you too stumble upon this slightly hidden restaurant and enjoy your evening. It was a very pleasant surprise for us. We are looking forward to going back.

Ps.. I just read the other reviews. Not sure when they went, but my pad tai came with chopped peanuts and even toasted coconut which I thought was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"First time visiting DeSiam. First impression: very clean, friendly service, authentic atmosphere. Food - well cooked, fast service. Ordered sweet & sour chicken with Singha beer and chicken pad Thai (served with side bowl of crumbled peanuts & toasted coconut flakes). Meal included a starter lemon grass soup & veg spring roll, which were fantastic! 
When I asked about the soup, the owner went out of his way to explain how it was cooked and offered me a small take away container free of charge. 
Great experience, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Don't let the decor fool you. We were expecting an authentic Thai experience but left with much to be desired. 
First, my friend ordered a Thai steak, but the kitchen replaced it with a chicken steak because they had no beef steak. The waitress also did not let us know of the shortage and accepted our order.
My pineapple fried rice was a mess - the rice was quite hard and also very burnt. The appetizer (we ordered a chicken satay dish) and the mains all seemed very tasteless and bland. Will not come again."}
{"text":"Ive been going here for almost 8years...Amazing! Food is always fresh and hott!! On my last visit the chef made us coconut wings to try because he was trying out a new receipe. IT WAS SOOO GOOD. My family and I usually get the Lemon grass soup(tomyum), cashew chicken, crispy Tamarind fish with sides of rice the and Beef Pad See-ew. We also tried the eggplant and tofu dish for one of our vegetarian family members who came and she rly liked that too!"}
{"text":"First time here and surprisingly the food is really good. We had around 7-8 dish and 9 out of 10 is very good. The coconut drink tastes very good. The mango salad is very good. If you haven't try it you should."}
{"text":"Desiam is great. The lady who owns the place super nice and attentive. Wait staff used to be surly, but the owner has done some excellent hiring recently, including a new chef, so previous comments about the food should be disregarded. Plus, we enjoy Thai and I've never found their food bland or unapetizing. 

My wife and I eat here often. It started as tiny then absorbed the business space next door. No rush here. Linger. Try spicy Ginger beef or fish. Sticky rice is sublime. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We used to like the spicy shrimp but the recipe or the chef must have changed. The overall quality of food seems to have diminished to a two and a half star over the pst two years but the service is still good.
Shared:
Spring Rolls
Red Curry Shrimp
Chicken w/cashews 
Steamed rice and hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The lady who works here is super friendly and quick with service. Surprisingly since I arrived later, I still got food quickly. 

I ordered the pineapple salad which consisted of canned pineapples. It was probably a 2-star dish but the quick friendly service brings it up. It's no Spring Rolls, but for Whitby it's not bad and worth a try."}
{"text":"To the point: The pad thai is one of the worst I've had.  Everyone thought it was tasteless.  It didn't even come with peanuts like it says on the menu. The only thing worth mentioning was the spring rolls. They were pretty good. 

For a place that lets you order online, they shouldn't be having these issues especially when it wasn't even busy inside. 5 if us ordered ahead of time to pick it up on our lunch break.  We all ordered the same thing,  pad thai.  We got there at 12:30, which is when they told us to pick it up.  We sat there and waited till 1:15!  They must have forgot because it wasn't even busy inside.  If I knew they started cooking when we showed up to pick it up we would have left but she kept telling us it's almost ready.  45 minutes later?  That's after the 45 minute wait after we called. 

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Maybe I expected too much? Maybe I just bias? Maybe Lunch Specials always not as good as dinner?

I am totally so disappointed with Desiam Thai Restaurant.

My Lunch Specials Pad Thai with Chicken ($7.99) is meh. The only good thing is it fresh from the wok so it is hot. But it just lack the look and the taste and the smell of Pad Thai. My bean sprouts are cooked, no herbs aside from green onions...  but at least it is not stir fried in ketchup...

The \"Tom Yum\" Soup is water down with no lemongrass taste and have a little piece of veggie here and there....

The restaurant itself has this funny smell......

The service though is nice and friendly, but I don't think I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow, really good food.  Now I'm not one to say that this taste like authentic Thai food, but it does have unique tastes that are not present in Toronto Thai restaurants.  The seating in this restaurant is comfortable with pictures and small Thai statues.  As for the food, we ordered the crispy Tamarind beef which was full of flavor and not too pepper hot (requested less pepper).  It was tender and coated lightly to give it a slight crispy taste.  The soup and spring rolls were also good too.  Although there was a mix up with bill at the end, it was still a good experience."}
