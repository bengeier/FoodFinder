{"text":"Banh mi Bistro has taken Vietnamese sandwich and appetizers to a whole new level. Banh mi bistro has now set a very high standard for sandwiches.  Their new fresh ingredients and innovation could only be explained when you order their sandwich.  I will be there every week."}
{"text":"Food was very fresh.  Vegetables really over powered the meat.  Not much difference in taste between bbq pork and lemon grass pork w/egg.  Over all it left me without a compelling reason to go back.  Flavor was just underwhelming."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for lunch! I especially like their Grilled Pork Bahn Mi, B?n with Grilled Pork and Spring Roll. Their Iced Coffee is also very good."}
{"text":"To have a \"snow\" spot close to the house is super awesome on its own, but add the fact that they also have very tasty banh mi sandwiches, and they've earned my vote. My husband did say the number 2. banh mi was the best sandwich he's ever had. I had the classic and we shared a shaved ice, which was also sooo good and refreshing after a hot day. We will definitely be making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"I got the chicken banh mi and I thought that the chicken was lacked of seasonings.. Blunt , no flavor. The carrots and white radishes are too big but the bread was good.  The egg rolls are not my favorite. I had the best crispy rolls at Angelina Pho.  Otherwise, the place is clean and that's a plus."}
{"text":"In town for biz trip. Asked hotel staff if there is any nice and easy place nearby. He recommended this place. I ordered #1, classic one. The Banh Mi is amazingly great. French baguette is toasted. Nice warm and crispy. Love it. The Vietnamese coffee is strong and tasty. The place is super clean. Perfect dining place for a long day."}
{"text":"I'm originally from California and you know they have the best banh mi sandwiches there. On top of that, I'm very picky about my banh mi cause its from my ethnic origin... I moved to Arizona about 16 years now and every time I visit San Diego. I buy a dozen banh mi and bring it back to az cause I couldn't find it anywhere. The last few years, I noticed banh mi started to introduced here and I was so disappointed after trying so many places that I gave up. Until, I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I must say, I am very satisfied and please with their banh mi sandwiches. This is my go to places for sandwiches now and I hope their business continue to thrive. The one downfall which is not their fault is the bread. For some reason, California's banh mi bread is a different type of bread. Overall, awesome Sandwich."}
{"text":"A damned good sandwich for very reasonable money, I thought, and milady wife enjoyed her salad/noodle bowl, too....very definitely makes this place one of the go-to joints in the 'hood for a quick, cheap and tasty lunch. No pho here, if that's for what you're lookin', though. Tell me....with all the interesting and varied flavors and cuisines on the table (literally) in this town, how do places like Subway and Burger King keep people's interest?"}
{"text":"Such a great place. New and amazing ways of types of banh mi. I love it ! Such a friendly environment as well!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place accidentally. my favorite sandwich shop recently closed down so this is a treasure finding. hmm shall I share it with my friends yet?"}
{"text":"They are missing whole entired ideology of our Vietnmese Famous  French Banh Mi Sandwiches from the meat to the bread, mainly Pate & Egg Yolk Mayonnaise. The Prices are way to high for.  Lee Lee Sandwiches in Chandler is very respectable."}
{"text":"Love this place. BMB Special is, well, special. Crisp bread on the outside, soft on the inside. Great flavor combination between the spice, sweet, fried egg and vegetables. A local favorite, will be there many more times."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Had the classic banh mi for lunch and it was delicious. For $6 you can't beat it. I think I've definitely found one of my new regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Never had Vietnamese food?  Not necessarily adventurous?  Me neither.  Sandwiches are fun, unique and very fairly priced.  Fresh ingredients, excellent quality of product and breads, fantastic flavor profiles that you'll crave the next day."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on our way to Sedona.  Great sandwiches, and the papaya salad was excellent.  Spring rolls were just fine.  Lots of food for a great price.  Wish we had one of these at home."}
{"text":"wife and I had a great little lunch here today. the number one classic and the number 7 shaken beef, we split halfsies.  I thought both could use a little salt, but wife said I was crazy (what's new). but I sprinkled them with a little soy sauce (bug juice) and I thought they were wonderful. it's now on our short list."}
{"text":"I had the grilled pork bahn mi and viet coffee and I must say I'm very surprised how delicious both of them were. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Yes!! This is what i'm talking about!! So good, so fresh and the owner is super nice and friendly. I have been here multiple times and never had a bad experience. Like Arnold says, \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Yum! Amazing food, service and super tidy. Love that they are vegetarian friendly AND there is more than one vegetarian option!"}
{"text":"I've so excited to have found this place. Definitely the best banh mi (that I've found) in Phoenix. My husband and I have gone here the past 4 Saturdays in a row... it's just that good. My favorite so far is the grilled pork - the lemongrass pork is so flavorful and tender!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because of Yelp.  Very clean.  Fantastic sandwich. Friendly.  This place is great.  Have no complaints. Will be back.  This place is less than half a mile from the house and I'd never have known about it except for Yelp."}
{"text":"Really good banh mi sandwiches, with a variety of combinations and meat options available. Pate and fried egg toppings available.  Also serves rice or noodle combo plates.  Good value for money. Largest size banh mi you'll find anywhere."}
{"text":"finally...been waiting for little saigon to expand and they hit the mark! New bistro is a great sandwich shop. I've had the steamed pork and the bo luc lac sandwiches and both have been awesome. Very fresh. Great bread, good bite to the vegetables and very tasty meat.   I also tried the spring rolls which were great. (loved the peanut sauce)  The owner was very friendly and seemed to be having fun.  Will surely return."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Lemongrass Tofu Bahn Mi at this place. The tiny little bits of hot peppers that suddenly punch you in the face halfway through the sandwich always delight me!  Initially, it was slightly disappointing that they only had the one vegetarian option, but they've updated the menu and added noodle salad bowls and rice plates.. all for less than $10!"}
{"text":"Place is very nice.  Great looking and very friendly staff.  The food is outstanding.  You get so much great food for your money."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying the cashier Jackie was very sweet and helpful. It's clean. I had grilled chicken with rice. It comes with a small salad with cucumber and an egg roll. I didn't expect that but hey thanks. The chicken here is fresh, pretty impressing for the price. I also wanted some boba, the cashier told me I should get the avocado one. It was delish. Before I left she did ask me if I liked it. That was sweet to ask."}
{"text":"Love this place ! It's clean, they are very friendly. Their sandwiches are fresh and big. I love their salad bowls. We get egg rolls or spring rolls. They even put an extra egg roll in if we order it and there is 2 of us. It normally comes with 3 rolls. We were happily surprise to find 4!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.. omg the banh mi are to die for.. The best I had since I've moved here..lol.. so happy and so close by... will definitely visiting once a week a week at least!!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are unique; choose your meat and they have a combination of homemade sauces topped with fresh and pickled vegetables.  The rice plates come with your choice of meat, fragrant white rice, a small refreshing salad and pork egg roll.  I do enjoy the boba as well but for some reason they don't have green tea smoothies.  The staff are all friendly and are sure to say hello and smile.  Call in ahead for fast service.  The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Cashiers were polite. Food came fast. And food was good! Very clean inside. Plenty of parking. All over pretty good place! Will definitely be coming back if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"For my first Banh Mi experience I don't have much to go on but this was pretty dam good. I had the grilled pork Banh Mi. The flavor on the sandwich were unlike anything I've had before but no complaints. I'm not a fan of bread but the bread was perfect. I could use a bit more meat though. I just like a lot of meat on my sandwiches but still a good sandwich. Spring rolls were perfect also. Peanut sauce wasn't too thick either.   I'll definitely be back to try the different sandwiches, rolls and the other items they have to offer."}
{"text":"The area seems like a hole in the wall, but they have excellent food and a clean atmosphere. Really enjoyed the egg rolls and they have a great noodle salad also. I totally recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. Owner is a nice guy. I try to stop by whenever i am nearby."}
{"text":"I use to think when starving, anything would be tasty. Let's just say, it's ok. I've had better Banh mi sandwhiches. I got the classic banh mi (special meat with bbq meat, pickled daikon and carrots, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno, and drizzled with a ooey sweet red sauce inside a french baguette)with a side of eggrolls (which comes in 3) and a taro boba. Their sandwhich had more pickled carrots and veggies then meat. Biting into it, there wasn't a balance of everything.   I tasted more of the veggies and baguette than then the meats. It was disappointing. The eggrolls was also a bummer. I thought I would be crunching into something delicious but instead it was a bite into mush. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but it looked and tasted like some veggie mashed with pork. I almost thought it was vegetarian eggrolls. Maybe it was? I am not quite sure what was in it because I had not read the description as I was just hungry and thinking....mmmm...eggrolls! But it wasn't an mmm reaction I got. I cant say anything horrible about my drink. The taro milk tea was nothing to special, just typical taro tea with boba. Boba wasn't fresh tasting, rubberish. I left not finishing my sandwhich and not satisfied."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places. I've been to Lee's Sandwiches and it's nothing compared to BMB. BMB's ingredients are far more superior and much more tasty. My favorite has to be the GRILLED PORK BANH MI and I love the FIRE CRACKER SALMON ROLLS and the Viet coffee with the condensed milk is to die for. Everyone needs to try this place. I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little Vietnamese eatery! Iv only been twice so i was surprised when i walked in the second time and the cashier already remembered me.  Iv gotten the pulled pork sandwich, grilled pork sandwich, and the egg rolls. Every bit has been delicious! Full of flavor and good fresh ingredients. The jasmine green tea is also rly good. It just adds to that healthy, fresh, Vietnamese feeling.   $5 for a big sandwich I can only eat half of, this little spot is well worth the visit! It's clean. It's got a cute, comfy little sitting area in the back w games. The staff are very friendly and fast. I feel rly good when I eat here. It's definitely become one of my new favorite sandwich spots."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich. It had a variety of fresh flavors in it. The pulled pork was super savory. I can tell it was marinated for a while. The marinated radish and carrots added so much flavor to the sandwich and gave it an amazing texture . I must say that the bread was the perfect thickness and so easy to bite in. Perfect exterior crunch and interior was soft and fresh."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. First sandwich was good. Second time I had plastic in my food. Ew Ew. The third time, my sandwich seemed rushed and sloppy. The carrots were cut in big chunks and I had to remove them. Overall, the flavors are ok but the quality is low. Unfortunately I will not be returning. It's far and the the quality of the food seems low."}
{"text":"Service: 4 Food: 3  Service was a little slow, but the cashier/maybe owner made a point to learn my name. Maybe slow because I ordered a sandwich with a fried egg, but some of the staff seemed to hustle and others not so much.   It may be a style thing, but I prefer my pickled carrots a little more pickle-y. The sandwich was absolutely humongous and could have definitely split with someone!   I have to say the bread was not bad either. I would say to get that 4/5 star, I want to see that crispy outside and soft on the inside- baguette was a little more soft/fell apart after digging in. I'll come back again soon as I know it's still new."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The owner is really nice and the food is awesome!! Every time we get the chance we will go to this Banh Mi shop!! My favorite is the grilled pork! Bread is perfect! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been coming for Vietnamese food since John and his lovely were in downtown Glendale.... I easily will eat here once a week... The food is simply divine.... the people are great... It is so fresh and everything is done so well... the decor, the awesome deliverables... You could close your eyes and just pick blind from the menu and you will not be disappointed.... The prices are so reasonable I feel guilty ordering... Top notch no lie ---- you are going to love it...."}
{"text":"The owners are fantastic, friendly people in the kitchen making your food magic happen. Bahn Mi is Vietnamese for sandwich and they have a variety including vegetarian options. They do not serve Pho as its readily found all over the valley but you'll love Bahn Mi. You'll also find firecracker salmon rolls, salad bowls, rice plates and dessert including smoothies, shaved ice and Vietnamese coffee!   Inside you'll find a welcoming and trendy lounge space designed by the owners where you'll want to escape Phoenix weather!  Thanks for the great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, and easy on the wallet! Casual laid back environment and friendly staff. Good for eat in or take out. Has vegetarian friendly options. Bottom line, great flavors and good quality!"}
{"text":"First time we came and was very impressed. We tried three of the sandwiches and one plate and liked them all. Very nice place inside. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best banh mi sandwiches I ever had. I go here at least once a week. I also tried the noodle salad bowls which are great. I would recommend anyone that likes Vietnamese good to try this place!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what they offer. We order the combo rice plate, noodles and smoothie. The smoothie cup is too small compared to other places I've been too. This probably is for American not vietnamese people. I find the taste is too bland. The smoothies taste very weird, not fresh at all"}
{"text":"So freaking good! First time here and I had to try like four different things.  I'll be back in a few days. I wish they had pork belly, maybe if I keep coming they will.  I live pho, but I'm happy they don't have it to \"focus on bánh mí\"."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!!! Food is bomb!! Shout out to John the owner for always taking care of me when I stop by every single day!!"}
{"text":"We have now visited this restaurant twice. We were not disappointed either time. The first time, I ordered the BMB Special. It was delicious, and a lot bigger than I was anticipating. Definitely worth the $6 price. The pork was extremely flavorful, the egg added a punch of flavor and texture, and the pickled veggies provided a nice crunch. On the second visit, I was tempted to get the BMB Special again, but I decided I needed to try more of the menu and settled on the Classic Banh Mi. This one was delicious as well. Again, the pork was flavorful, the ham was nice and fresh, and the bread was perfectly baked.   Service both times was fast and friendly, and the restaurant is nice and clean. With the great food, convenient location to work, and great prices ($5-$8 for most items on the menu), we will definitely return often."}
{"text":"Wow!  So much better than anything we have in Reno, NV.  Fresh, clean, well designed menu and decor.  Egg rolls were great!  Salad noodle bowls are out of this world.  My kids loved the pot stickers.  Had a peach ginger tea and coconut milk tea and forgot we had food for a minute.  The mango snow was enough for four of us and then some.  Please move to Reno and open up a place."}
{"text":"Every single time I eat from this place it is consistently excellent.  Everytime I visit this place the customer service is exceptionally friendly and warm.  Someone I worked with told me there was no way that this Banh Mi was better than Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler.  So, I went to Lee's and ordered a Banh Mi comparable to my favorite here.  It was a very good sandwich worthy of my coworker's praise.  However, Lee's is in Chandler, the bread was inferior, and the customer service, although just fine, wasn't equal.  I wouldn't drive to Chandler just for a Lee's Bahn Mi while living in N. Phoenix, but if I lived in Chandler, I'd drive to N. Phoenix just for the #1 (Classic Bahn Mi) at Banh Mi Bistro.  A heartfelt thank you!"}
{"text":"Tried out this spot today and it was yummy! I had a ginger peach tea and a grilled chicken noodle salad bowl. The dressing was awesome. The establishment was clean. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The shaken beef sandwich was amazing! All the ingredients are extremely fresh. That was a delicious lunch. New spot for lunch."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food I've had so far in the US! Unbelievable, and for a crazy low price. Will be there pretty much every day now:)"}
{"text":"\"Good stuff Maynard!\"  If you didn't see the 1983 Malto o Meal Commercial, view it here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAJNn6SETs  I was actually looking for an Indian restaurant in the area, but three in a row from my car GPS turned out to be closed businesses.  I saw the sign for Banh Mi, and decided to stop in.  I had the vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll.  There was an ample amount of pork and like the egg roll, it was cooked to order. Pork was cooked through, but tender.  The shredded lettuce, mint and cucumber was very refreshing.  Please put Hoisin and Sriracha on every table. I would award 5th star for that."}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese food here in Glendale, AZ? Yes, absolutely! We had the bun; bun thit nu'ong and bun ga nu'ong (and an iced coffee). What a delight to the taste buds! Everything was very fresh and tasted delicious. Warning: if you go around noon, don't expect to find a place to sit. There are a couple of outside tables, but the line is long and the tables inside are pretty much full. We will definitely be back before we head north to go home."}
{"text":"Hey this place is so good!!!! Better than most bahn mi I've had (and I'm from San Jose, CA aka viet food central). The #2 bmb special was so yummy... Especially with the fried egg in it!! I also tried the #7 shaken beef and it was very unique and also delicious.   I would for sure be a regular here if I lived in Arizona! Hopefully I can find a place like this in Cali.   Sandwiches are seriously 5 star.   The only issue was that the vermicelli noodles we got in the vermicelli bowl were broken up. Just wasn't as good as the sandwiches.  Ermagod come here and get #2!!! I just ate mine and I want another one already. Btw these sandwiches are HUGE! Like over a foot long. Cray cray!"}
{"text":"The banh mi here was huge. Really, it is almost a foot long. I think there was a banh mi deal going on also: buy 5, get 1. I think.   The grilled pork I ordered was pretty tasty, but it wasn't awesome. I think the seasoning on the pork was okay, but the meat's proportion was a little on the low end. The classic banh mi was tasty. I guess it had a little bit of everything so the flavors and textures were unique. The shaken beef one was pretty good. The beef was a tad too salty for my palate during this particular visit, but it was good nonetheless. Everyone seemed to agree that this was the sandwich to get. Even after eating these sandwiches as a snack later, the bread was still good, not hard or stale.   A good stream of people went in and out, and eventually there was a line that formed. A totally good sign that the locals adore this place. This is a new restaurant too with the sign outside still having its temporary store banner. Parking was pretty plentiful since Banh Mi Bistro was located near the end of this complex."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love the Food here. Great prices, the Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the best."}
{"text":"I've visited Banh Mi on several occasions with my co-workers, and I'm never disappointed. The food usually comes out quickly, and is fresh. I like that I can leave feeling full but I don't feel like I'll be going into a food coma later in the day. It's a great spot to grab lunch in the middle of the work day.   I have gotten 2 of the sandwiches and have been getting the salad noodle bowl lately. Both choices are very good. I would recommend anyone who has an open mind to visit Banh Mi. Most of their dishes have a lot of vegetables, and other ingredients in them. If you don't like food that is non-traditional, you probably shouldn't be eating at any vietnamese place anyway. I only wish they served Pho here. Which they make clear with the No Pho sign at the register.   All in all, good food, good service, fairly well priced."}
{"text":"I drove by and decided to stop for lunch. Wow! They deserve 5 stars. The cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of service and friendliness and quality of food is magnificent. I got the shaken beef Vietnamese sandwich and yum! You can just taste that it's made with love! :) I also got the green tea milk with boba for the first time it's awesome. John is excellent he has to be the owner or manager. I will definitely be having lunch here again and bring all my friends! Thank you John for such a lovely lunch"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place almost daily for three years and never stopped in, I now regret the last three years. The staff is very friendly, food was prepped quickly, and best of all... the food and drinks are phenomenal!!! I know now I will be back to try other items on the menu, to which I'm sure I'll bee 100% satisfied with. Don't be a dummy like me and pass this place by."}
{"text":"Clean place. The staff friendly and helpful. My family tried and shared the classic bang mi sandwich. Wonderful fresh flavors and the French bread nice and crusty. We tried also the fresh spring rolls delicious my Filipino wife said. Tried the Lotus root salad this was my favorite and stood out such fresh and sweet flavor combinations! My daughter tried the strawberry shaved snow with strawberry boba  and chocolate glaze . so sweet. Reminded us and similar to Filipino halo halo."}
{"text":"Probably 4.5 but that's okay, this place is pretty good. Very good and fresh Banh Mi sandwiches, really good Green Papaya salad, and the rolls are quite good also. Good pricing and service is also pretty good. Will be going back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. I was introduced to it thanks to my Phoenician boyfriend Mike. We both work within close proximity and I encourage all my co workers to try it. Every time I see someone with Ban Mi at work it makes me 1. Smile 2. Envious 3. Immediately need my own! Never disappoints and always hits the spot!! I can't say enough good things but the pot stickers and spring rolls are a must! So fresh!"}
{"text":"The best bahn mi in town. rice plates and vermicelli noodles are also very good!!! Prices are cheap as well unlike other places which are overpriced. place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"This was my first time here... I had the Noodle salad with shrimp and pork!! Really Yummy! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a beautiful restaurant. Always clean and tidy. They have a communal table with games for an impromptu game night! The staff is friendly & knowledgeable. The food is incredible and you get a lot for the price! I had the classic banh mi along with their coconut milk tea. YUMMY! I go there weekly now but can't stray away from the classic! I've tried different drinks though--their peach ginger iced tea, green milk tea and their passion fruit iced tea....all delicious! I can't get enough of this place! It's a must!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for letting our dog hang out with us outside while we eat. They have 2 small tables and a couple of chairs out front, but it was perfect.  Randomly decided to try this place on our way out to Sedona and so glad we did!! Wish I was hungry enough to try the sandwiches though. We got the shaved ice with fresh fruit... OMG! So good!!!! My friend got some bun thit nuong. My friend loves it!! The fresh squeezed orange juice is so delicious, I'm getting another one to go!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The owners are super friendly and generous. The banh mis are always on point to say the least. Boba teas are killer! Everything is made in house, including the shaved ice which is phenomenal. Can't say enough good things about this gem! Best Banh MI in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been here 2 times, and both times we were amazed with how fresh and delicious our sandwiches were. The first time I had the Shaken Beef sandwich, & the second time I had their Pork Meatball. These sandwiches were seriously OFF THE HOOK ! Quite possibly the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. My third visit will be spent feasting on the Classic Banh Mi original, as I have already planned my return. I can't wait !"}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant through AZ Foodie's post on IG, the noodle salad bowl looked so good I had to try it! I ordered the Noddle Salad Bowl with grilled chicken and a pork egg roll. The salad bowl has cold noodles, carrots, lettuce, mint, cucumber, cilantro. A fresh and savory salad bowl, exceeded my expectations. It's like having everything that's in a spring roll in a bowl. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic food! We had the pulled poker and BBQ pork banh mi and potstickers. Bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and light and soft on the inside. Vegetables were crunchy, not overly sweet or vinigar tasting. Meats were perfect.  Potstickers had great texture and flavor and the dipping sauce was perfect. The sandwich in the picture is only half and it was $7. Excellent value and we had a fun chat with the owner. The service was excellent. This is a must eat place."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best food I've ever eaten. After eating here, I just felt totally content and blissful. Best egg rolls I've ever had, and the Bahn Mi I had was heavenly."}
{"text":"I drive from Gilbert to get their #2 BMB Special. I love Lee's Sandwich, but when I am feeling extra, Banh Mi Bistro gives me that extra. Hot and fresh! The sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying bahn mi and tried the hong Kong bbq pork and the lemongrass pork.  The lemongrass pork had pretty good flavor.  The cilantro was very flavorful,  but I didn't taste the jalapenos at all.   The Hong Kong pork was flavorless and I really didn't like it at all.   They are a really good size for the price,  cut in half for easy sharing.   Overall it was ok but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The banh mi's at Banh Mi Bistro are the best I've ever had! I always get either the grilled pork or grilled chicken, and both are flavorful and delicious! The people who work here are very friendly, the restaurant is clean, and there's always plenty of parking. There usually isn't too long of a wait either, even when it's busy during the lunch rush. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and very reasonably priced. Get an appatizer while your there"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place! This was my first visit here. I came upon recommendation of a close friend. There were 6 of us in our party and we order a ton of food! I got to try several things on the menu and everything was delicious. For much of the order, we relied on the staffs recommendations. They were very friendly and helpful. I'll surely visit again when I'm in the area again. Thanks Banh Mi!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Perfect Sammy- Good portion of meat and veggies with real nutritional value, even fresh herbs.  All stuffed into thin chewy crusty baguette that doesn't overwhelm its contents. It's a little silly how happy I am about this.  They have Thai tea with BOBAS. No extra charge. They have a large size for a great price which I'm also stoked about.  *BOBAS- fun chewy tapioca balls you slurp up with your tea*  I called in my pick up order and they were very nice & professional on the phone. My food was all ready to go when I got there 15 mins later.  Facility was noticeably clean which is appreciated."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and it lived up to the great reviews! I had the Vegetarian Spring Rolls and the Classic Banh Mi...Super Fresh and delicious!!! I'll be returning for sure!!! I definitely wanna come back and try the BMB Special and Boba!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good. Had the BBQ pork banh mi, shaken beef banh mi, papaya salda, and the noodle bowl. The shaken beef is amazing! Super tender and flavorful! The noodle bowl is huge and you get 2 choices of meat/veggies. Portion sizes are huge even on the papaya salad. We were looking for a place just like this for the longest time and I'm so glad we finally found our go-to spot!"}
{"text":"So far I have tried the vegetarian and the chicken bahn mi. They have been very accommodating to modification requests. Found the food to be fresh and tasty. Will definitely continue to go sample their yummy menu. They are also very gracious!"}
{"text":"I was close to giving this place 5 stars. I have been here three times, and the food and staff are both great. I think the same very nice tall guy has helped me at the register at each visit. I've had almost every type of banh mi, the egg rolls, spring rolls, boba tea, and this last time, the bun. I had grilled pork bun and added shrimp. I'm fine paying for good food, but when I am charged 2 dollars for shrimp, I expect more than three very small shrimp. Double the amount of shrimp or charge 75 cents for the add-on. It was absolutely pathetic. My name is Stirling Peters.  Edit: I forgot how good the spring rolls were. Up to a 4. The addition of sausage in them just beats out all other spring rolls I've had."}
{"text":"I would have never known this gem was in this little shopping center if my friend had not told me. I got a bowl with vermicelli noodles, peanuts,cucumbers, bean sprouts topped with porky and egg rolls. The portion was perfect for a light lunch. My friend got a sandwich that looked very good. I would try that next time. I love finding mom and pop hidden gems,"}
{"text":"Had the Bo luc lac sandwich. It was da bomb, and the interior was well-decorated, very modern/simple feel. I am very picky about Vietnamese food, so to give it 5 stars is saying a lot."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at this place, everything is a home-run. Order the #3, it may be the most popular sandwich there, I know it's my favorite. Great appetizer, Ban, and bubble tea. Ask for the garlic chille sauce, it's really good"}
{"text":"Love their spring rolls and noodle bowls. They're amazing. Sometimes though in the spring rolls the pork can be fatty. So I end up throwing half of my spring roll away . But overall i really love it here."}
{"text":"If I worked / lived in the area, I'm sure that Bahn Mi Bistro would be a place I'd frequent for lunch! We were in that area on Saturday so we couldn't pass up the opportunity to stop by.  I got the Noodle Salad Bowl with Grilled Chicken & Vegetarian Egg Roll and my husband got the Shaken Beef Rice Plate. The Egg Roll was seriously so good that I almost went up to get a side order of them! I mostly enjoyed the rest of the Noodle Bowl because the veggies were fresh & crunchy. Unfortunately, the noodles were plain & the fish sauce didn't add much flavor; it would've been nice if there was a better sauce for that portion of the dish. The Shaken Beef looked tasty as well, my husband enjoyed it. I didn't try it but he ate the whole thing so it must have been good!  Overall, I'd say that I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The prices are fair & the food is good though. As mentioned previously, this is definitely one of those restaurants I would keep in mind if I was near there!"}
{"text":"Our first time in.  The owner was helpful and encouraged us to ask questions. Very friendly fast service. The food was very good. Fresh and flavorful.  The serving size for the price is amazing.  By the time we left we had already picked out what we wanted to order the next time we eat here."}
{"text":"I don't even know what I was looking for when I came across this business on yelp, but I bookmarked it right away. After about a week it was still all I could think about so as soon as opportunity presented itself, I drove up to Bell to check it out.  I ordered the roast pork banh mi and my lunch date ordered the shaken beef. We shared an order of potstickers. For drinks I had a Thai milk tea (no boba for me this time) and my girlfriend had a green tea.   Our sandwiches were amazing. Full of meat and veggies. The only downfall was the toasted baguette ripped the top of our mouths apart (don't you HATE when that happens?!), but I probably would have still chased my first sandwich with another if I was hungry enough and suffered the consequences. My Thai tea was awesome, her green tea was horribly bitter, most likely the result of tea bags being left in too long. Not going to drop a star off for iced tea though.  The winner of the whole lunch was the potstickers. Hands down, best I've ever had. We ordered the pork (there is also a chicken option) and they were amazing!! Handmade, steamed and fried, little pillows of meaty goodness.   The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, and the menu has so many options, there is so,etching for everyone. I can't wait to go back to try the shaved ice.."}
{"text":"OMGSH!  I finally got to try Banh Mi!  It's been on my list of \"must trys\" for a long while but since I don't make it to this part of town often it was still on that list.  I found them on Yelp when I had been searching for Vietnamese restaurants.  It did not disappoint.  So glad I was able to check it off on my list and I'll be making that happen again.  Wish I lived closer but we will find a way to try out many more of their menu choices.  I had the Noodle Bowl with shrimp.  What a perfect balance of flavors!  I can't wait to find a reason to head that way again.  Thank you Banh Mi.  You do an excellent job!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. On all accounts my experience was terrible. Worst potstickers I've ever ever had."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it was AMAZING! i had the grilled chicken sandwich and the iced Vietnamese coffee was the best. The restaurant was clean & modern-looking. Definitely will be back. I 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to come to on the weekly. This place reminds me it's Saturday because I patiently wait once every week to come here. A clean place with great customer service. First off, for being Vietnamese they DO NOT any Pho. Which is fine because I come for what they are known for, the Banh Mi, the #2 BMB in particular. It's the only thing I EVER order. Not that everything else on the menu is bad, I just know what makes me happy and it's that juicy meat with the eggs and pate. Also with all the money you're saving from buying a $6-8 sandwich, I suggest getting a smoothie with boba. It cuts the salty ness and heat from the sandwich. So GOOD!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Shaken beef sandwich was excellent and John and the staff could not be more friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to try more on their menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. My mom and I have been frequenting more often because it's great. John the owner, I think, is super nice and always remembers our orders! We usually get the banh mi thit nuong and the ginger peach tea. It's amazing!! They don't skimp out on the meat like other banh mi places so that's a major plus. The price is affordable as well! I have been recommending this place to others and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Do yourself a favor and go, everything is amazing here.  I recommend the Bao Buns, Lemon Grass Pork Sandwich, and Passion Fruit Ice Tea.   Their noodle salads are fantastic as well.    I eat here at least three times a week and it is fresh and delicious every time."}
{"text":"Its getting pretty hot out and I work out side. The last thing I want to do is eat something that is heavy and make the rest of my day miserable. Banh Mì Bistro has a great and tasty solution.   Banh Mì is a Vietnamese bisto that has some signature Vietnamese dishes but their signature dish is the banh mì sandwich. It is usualy a pork sandwich with fresh ingredients, aioli, on a fresh baguette.   I ordered the BBQ pork. It is a Hong Kong styled bbq pork sandwich. I decided to get everything in mine which had the aioli, pickled carrots, daikon radish, cilantro, jalapenõ and sliced cucumbers.  This sandwich hit the spot! It had a little of everything which was brought togeather nicely with a great baguette. Also there was some fresh brewed iced tea and green tea along with some other drink options.  I highly recommend getting over to get a great sandwich from Banh Mì Bistro!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place! Love bahn mi and am so happy this exists in north Phx. Cute place, good prices, delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and fell in love with the food!! It's such a  cute and hip restaurant with very comfortable seating.   The noodle bowl I had was amazingggg! Had it with chicken, as you can pick the style of protein that you'd like and the chicken was very tasty!   Service was awesome and the place was clean. I will definitely be back for some more!  Oh and they have dessert!"}
{"text":"Quickest, cleanest Vietnamese restaurant we've ever been to. New kind of food so delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in a week. That should say something. Tried the classic banh mi and thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. Fresh vegetables and great flavors certainly make these sandwiches a winner. Priced very reasonable. Second visit sampled the BBQ pork banh mi and was as good or better than the classic. Will be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I came across this small little eatery after dropping off my dry cleaning and stumbled upon it. I decided to stop in and give it a try since I saw the good yelp reviews. It does not disappoint. I got the noodle bowl with grilled pork and egg roll. It was fantastic!!!! I was worried cause the fish sauce vinegarette can sometimes be too over powering but this place does it right!!!! I will definitely be back to try the sandwiches and fresh spring rolls. I am so excited to find a place that does noodle bowls like this, truly a hidden gem in this strip mall."}
{"text":"Oh how I love the special . Had it several times now. A explosion of flavor in your mouth. The egg on top gives it the perfect finishing touch. Add the jalapenos for an extra kick. The spring rolls are good too. But the star of the show is the sandwich. They also have free WIFI with password. THis place doesn't serve Pho."}
{"text":"Banh Mi is located on the north side of bell in the same parking lot as Lamars Donuts.  The inside is small/30 capacity, super clean, and feels well decorated for an order at the counter spot.  I ordered the chicken potstickers, #2 bmb special, and a thai milk drink.  The potstickers were fresh, hot, and really food.  They came with a nice dipping sauce and were well proportioned.  I enjoyed the taste and texture.  The #2 was a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  It was stuffed with grilled pork, a fried egg, fresh veggies, and packed in a homemade bun as long as my forearm.  It was very tasty and freshly made.    The thai drink was premade which bummed me out a bit but it was tasty.  I wouldnt recommend the #2 unless you are sharing.  And it def is big enough to share.  The reason I write this is that I am a good sized fully grown man and no way could I finish it.  Fried egg doesnt really travel well so I had to regretfully throw out nearly half a sandwich.    I would however recommend this place and will be back for more without a doubt.   Great work guys!"}
{"text":"Only had the shaved snow which was good.  Would love to come back for the lotus salad.  People were very friendly"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not review this place. I love banh mi. It's a classic, traditional, Vietnamese sandwich. However, it is difficult to locate a cafe that serves it here in Phoenix. I normally go to Lee's Sandwich which is far out of range for me. I think this places serves better sandwiches than Lee's. It' s a must try for all!"}
{"text":"Haven't found one sandwich or bowl yet that I don't like!!!! All soooooo yummy, and HUGE in flavor.   Only critique is in the boba, better quality needed but doesn't stop me from eating everything else lol!"}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese sandwich place in Arizona. We don't come here often as we live in Tucson, but we passed by recently on the way up to Page on a random Thursday a little after 11 am. The place was already packed, and for good reason. Great prices, and the business really has it together with getting food out fast despite how many customers come in. Huge, delicious sandwiches, with a good portion of meat and veggies on toasted bread. Great boba drinks as well. I only wish there were more flavors to choose from. Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out with my wife and some friends. We all really like Vietnamese food and the menu here looked very tasty.  Inside is very clean and decorated very simple. The menu is pretty basic and you order at the counter and pick it up when it is ready.  Ordered some Spring Rolls, an order of both Chicken Pot Stickers and Pork and some of their top secret Pork Belly Bao Buns. I had to try out one of their sandwiches and decided to start with the Classic #1. It has a combination of Vietnamese Ham, Bologna and their homemade Pate with the typical standard toppings.  Everyone loved the Pot Stickers and the Bao Buns so much we ordered a second batch. The dipping sauces are really good and a squirt of Sriracha Sauce really kicked them up a notch. The Spring Rolls were very good as well but stuck to the paper plate and came apart when the ladies were trying to share them. My #1 Banh Mi Sandwich was delicious and I gobbled it down rather quickly.  Service is very friendly and helpful. I met the owner who was working the front and we talked about food and flavors and how there is not much of this type of cuisine up in this neck of the wood. It is always nice to eat at a family owned restaurants and this place is very cool.  Looking forward to trying out more of their Sandwiches, Noodle Bowls and Rice Dishes. The prices are very reasonable and the food is packed with fresh ingredients and TLC.  This is not a PHO restaurant so don't expect a hot bowl of tasty soup. Check out their nicely done colorful website to see the full menu. See ya there next time during a weekend lunch. My mouth is drooling right now just from writing this review. YES!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Nice clean place serving something different in the area!  Great sandwiches. Friendly service.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very very very clean. First time there. Had their boba drink. It's not wow amazing. But also I'm not Vietnamese, so I wouldn't know much about taste. But I like the fact the kitchen was very clean!!!"}
{"text":"Read about this shop on Yelp. It had rave reviews for being open just a short time. I was in Phoenix for the day and was looking for a quick lunch stop. It's a little out of the way in a isolated strip mall but you forget about the location once you walk through their doors. The restaurant is clean and modern, the staff friendly and welcoming. I ordered the Classic Banh Mi and Green Papaya Salad. I can see why this place has 5 stars. The sandwich was delicious. Crisp, light, airy baguette, fresh veggies and flavorful meat. I actually felt that the layer of meat was too thin but it was still very good. The salad was crisp and refreshing topped with shrimp. Wish there was a Banh Mi Bistro in my neck of the woods so I could eat my way through their whole menu."}
{"text":"I was not a fan. I had been excited to try this place for quite some time but everything just fell flat in the flavor department. From a bland sand which to an okay Vietnamese coffee to fried paper towel stuck to my egg rolls (yuck!) I was sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm so happy my work place is about 10 min away from this place. This is such a great place for lunch especially if you're craving Vietnamese food! I really do enjoy the food here, but their hours never worked out with my schedule. Now I have nothing to worry about and can get my banh mi fix anytime I'm craving it! The banh Mi is not the only food item that is delicious here. I had the Bum Tom Thit Nuong the other day and that was good too! They gave you a good portion and don't skimp out on their meats/veggies! They also have tasty boba drinks and snow dessert here. I am looking forward to trying the Broken rice plate here on my next visit. The owner is very nice and friendly and I loved how he kept a professional and nice manner during my phone order (some places like to rush you but he didn't!) Good food and customer service, the 2 most important factors for any restaurant! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Grilled pork chop rice plate is the bomb.   Bun (noodle bowl) is great and you can't go wrong with a sandwich."}
{"text":"I could eat a the shaken beef every day.  It will be hard for me to stray to try anything else. Fast friendly service. I wish they were open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!  Well seasoned,  fresh and full of flavor.  As an appetizer we got the salmon rolls,  incredibly delicious!  Our dishes were amazing as well.  I got a noodle bowl with egg roll and grilled shrimp.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich for my kids,  it was big enough for them to split and tasted great!  We also got the Thai milk teas with bobas,  very yummy!  The restaurant was very clean and organized.  There was someone cleaning up on the floor the whole time we were there.  Very impressed with the cleanliness :)"}
{"text":"Best Banh mi sandwich to be found anywhere including california! Must have is the number 2 Banh mi! You can get it as a rice dish instead of a sandwich, but it will cost you extra for the egg!"}
{"text":"Killin it  This place has amazing food with great people with awesome smiles and the best customer service. Always, it doesn't matter if its togo or dine in my experience at Banh Mi Bistro is what any person would ask for just perfect 6stars******"}
{"text":"Great owners, customer service and amazing food! The sandwiches are the Americanized version of the Vietnamese classics!  LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Must go for their amazing bahn mi sandwiches. Just the right bread with the crunch on the outside and soft roll on the inside and the pickled veggies with  heat with pate .. Must also try their bubba smoothie with tapioca bubbles.  Have not had a better bahn mi ..been there multiple times."}
{"text":"Healthy, mom & pop, what's not to love? The food is delicious, and they're super friendly. Hard to see from the street, but definitely worth seeking out. This is one of those places you feel good spending at. I've ordered everything on the menu at least once, and you can't go wrong. Even my picky retiree parents like it."}
{"text":"Don't let the location of this place fool you. I walked inside and was definitely impressed with how clean everything looked. The air conditioner was on and it felt so cool & refreshing. Modern interior design, and flat screens for the menus. They do not have PHO here though so that was a bummer, but everything looked very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I got the classic banh mi (#1) and am not dissappointed! Lots of flavor and super fresh veggies. Bread is also baked to a great balance! I also opted in for the Vietnamese iced coffee and am not dissappointed either. Great taste, strong and smooth. Friendly reminder that they do not serve pho and are located right off the 17."}
{"text":"Fell into this place while looking for a spot to work. Saw yelp reviews and had to take a chance. #7 was delicious but the green papaya salad was the best thing I had. I wish the had eggs and spam for breakfast! ;)"}
{"text":"Very good fast food lunch spot. I stopped by on sales calls today. The pork meatball sandwich was very delicious and the lemon ginger tea was refreshing.   The prices are affordable and the design is very clean and modern feeling.   Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"My favorite local food spot! Great food, awesome people! My two most favorite items are the egg rolls (by far the best I've ever eaten) and the ginger peach tea. I also enjoy the grilled chicken bahn mi sandwich. If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly amazing! My boyfriend and I stumbled across it one day and we've been coming back for more ever since! Their bahm mi is great, but my personal favorite is their honeydew smoothie with boba. Truly amazing."}
{"text":"I love to have Vietnamese sandwich for breakfast but unfortunately they're not open until 11Am :-( but it's ok , I've trying to stop by every week on my only day off and my favorite is #7. The fresh orange juice is so good not too sour like jumper juice."}
{"text":"Happy to note that a new Vietnamese eatery has been added to north Phoenix, and conveniently located on Bell Rd. just off I-17. Wondering why they decided to call it a bistro rather than just a restaurant, I decided to give it a try. It's definitely cozy, smaller than most Vietnamese eateries in the Valley but it's very clean and has a bit of a trendy look. The menu selection is smaller than in most Vietnamese restaurants, which is a good thing actually - it makes ordering easier, and the simple menu is displayed in 2 screens just over the counter. They do serve Asian shaved ice and milk teas, which is definitely a plus. The food is tasty, full of the refreshing savory-herbal flavors characteristic of the cuisine - and inexpensive, which is an important consideration for me. Another bonus: WiFi is available!"}
{"text":"Friends in AZ kept telling me about this spot so we finally got to try it. I love Vietnamese sandwhiches so you understand why it was a must try.  Final analysis, very good. My son even liked it and he's not really into Vietnamese sandwhiches. He had the one with a fried egg, I tried a bite and it definitely added a new taste to the sandwhich. I had the special combo and truly enjoyed it. The bread is different from most Vietnamese sandwiches baguettes, softer and very tasty when served hot."}
{"text":"My wife had the vegetarian noodles (with tofu and vegetables) while I had the rice with pork. Both portions were generous. My pork was nicely marinated and sliced partially, so it was easier for me to cut bite sized portions. What I especially liked was the fresh chili sauce. For those who love spicy food, nothing is better than fresh chili sauce, not even the prevalent Sriracha. Latter is bottled and had preservatives! We would recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great food!  Excellent flavors.  My dad and I split the BBQ Pork, and the BMB Special sandwiches.  Perfect size, great food.  And the Spring Rolls are always amazing.  Come check them out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum! We had the #2 bahn mi plus spring rolls and it was delicious! Huge portions! Everyone was super friendly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Blew me away. So good for having such reasonable prices. A brilliant take on Vietnamese food crossed with a hoagie roll. I would never have guessed it would taste so good. The high ratings you see for this restaurant are very well-deserved. Give it a shot for lunch when you have a chance, try the shaken beef, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Greatest banh mi I ever ate. I've been going here every Saturday and i love it! People over here are also super nice!  Banh mi #3 add eggs and grilled pork noddles are my favorite!:)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! I ordered the #7 Shaken beef and I highly recommend it!!! You MUST order it with the fried egg.  Actually everything on this menu should have a fried egg on it! We also ordered crab puffs, egg rolls and the vegetable platter...all Amazing."}
{"text":"Thank you Norm R. for your great recommendation.  When I read your review, I bookmarked it immediately.  Since then, I have been craving a banh mi.  Finally, today I had an opportunity to have lunch with my husband, so I suggested this place to him.  He loves asian fare, so he was thrilled.  We drove the 21 miles it took to get there.  The place is in a strip mall that has several other restaurants.  Upon entering, I noticed how clean it is.  It also looks fairly modern.  The people working there were very welcoming.  I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi and my husband had the Shaken Beef banh mi.  The prices are very reasonable, mine was $5 and my hubby's was the most expensive banh mi at $7.  I loved my choice, the baguette was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the chicken was nicely seasoned and it came with onions, cilantro and some other veggies. I almost think I liked my husband's sandwich better, but cannot decide yet.  This place is sure worth the drive, we want to try the bowls of vermicelli noodles next time as well as the dessert.  I might have to share my sandwich next time, because it is pretty long, at least a foot long. P.S. I went back a couple of days later and had the Pork Banh mi and the Bun, a noodle and veggies salad bowl with chicken and shrimp, it was awesome."}
{"text":"Holy hole in the wall, Batman.   I was up in north Phoenix for a business meeting and found this amazing Vietnamese banh mi place that rivals those in the OC.  You don't have to clean your earwax, you heard me.   Got their BM special with BBQ pork and two wonderfully cooked over medium eggs perfectly garnished with the usual suspect of cilantro, cucumber, and picked carrots and daikon.  Jalapeño optional and pate a must.  The bread itself was slightly soggy from all the ingredients.   I also got a side of pork meatballs which has a little kick of heat.  Doesn't taste like traditional sui mai, but an interesting recipe all the same.  The Viet coffee tasted like it's been sitting there a little as it was a bit sour.  Sour coffee is no Bueno.   Great customer service, minimum wait time during rush hour, and very modern space.   Definitely didn't figure to find a place like this considering where I was.   A bit pricey, but worth it for the good ingredients.  Easy parking and accepts credit card."}
{"text":"Not my usual side of town for a lunch stop, but glad we made the trip.  This is a good spot (but it's a \"No Pho\" zone (they have a sign and everything) - fine with me, I love Bun.  I got my usual (Bun - grilled pork and pork egg roll on vermicelli noodles with pickled carrots, radishes, lettuce, cucumber, cilantro and peanuts).  Really generous portions.  Grilled pork was very tasty.  Also ordered (if you've read my reviews of other Vietnamese restaurants, you know what's coming) - ca phe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee).  It was also good.  The staff was very friendly.  The joint was jumpin' (good lunch crowd), and for good reason!  Give them a try.  Will have to try a Banh Mi sandwich next time (they looked huge!)."}
{"text":"Came with a large party. Great service, wonderful venue. Will be back! Loved the Shaken Beef."}
{"text":"These Noodle Salad Bowl here haunts my dreams in all the right ways. I have this noodle bowl at least once a week and it never gets old, with its refreshing mint, cilantro, bean sprouts, pickled carrots, daikon radish, cucumbers and scallions over thin rice noodles... you get to pick 2 proteins a top as well. My favorite being the Pork Spring Rolls and the Thin Grilled Pork. SO DAMN ADDICTING!! Oh and don't forget about the light refreshing dressing of Peanut and Sweet Fish Sauce Vinaigrette. Mmmm... That's it... I'm having this for dinner tonight. Anyway. My husband get's the same thing every time as well. He get's the BMB Special Banh Mi Sandwich with grilled pork, fried egg and pate. It also comes with the usual Banh Mi suspects of Homemade Aioli, Pickled Carrots, Daikon Radish, Cilantro, Jalapeno, and Sliced Cucumbers in a Fresh Baguette. I do suggest you ask them to cook your egg over easy as they tend to over cook it. But just like the noodle dish it's so refreshing and full of flavor. Lastly if you have any room left the Shaved Snow Da Bao. Shaved snow is like a mix between shaved ice and ice cream. Its melt in your mouth. You get to pick on flavor of snow, 2 toppings, and one glaze. I like the Coconut snow with strawberries and mango, with the condenced milk glaze. Its the perfect treat! Its light and fluffy and again that word.... FRESH!! You really cant go wrong here. Please don't be afraid to try something different and step out of your box. You can't go wrong here.   A few important side notes: This place is family owned and operated. Make sure to check their website as they take off holidays and family vacations.  They also close very early. M-F 11am - 7:30pm, Saturday 11am - 5pm And they are closed every Sunday"}
{"text":"We like coming here. Food is good but the cashier had an attitude today.  Last visit I gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, good boba drinks. I'm glad this place opened up. It's a unique flavor that i think everyone will enjoy. The bread is fresh and the ingredients all seem to compliment each other. Well done folks. Oh and they are all nice there."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in town. I highly recommend the The BMB. The bread is chewy with a soft crust. The pork is savory and the egg is the cherry on top. It's the only place I know that puts an egg in their banh mi.  The sandwich is 14 inches long, definitely shareable.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A lovely Vietnamese bistro. What a great concept. The food is outstanding and fast. Service was very professional. Noise level quiet chatter which was great"}
{"text":"This place has great bahn mi! Really good. The portion sizes are great. My only knock against this place is the smoke inside. They need to get a better ventilation system. I smelled like smoke the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This place has great food! They don't serve pho but their banh mi is delicious and they have vermicelli like bowls. They also have milk tea, Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee. It's a counter service restaurant. Very casual."}
{"text":"Great value for great food.  The sandwiches are big and the sides are tasty. Try the pork belly bao. The dining room is always clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant. Friendly people and delicious food. Recommend the great sandwiches, bun and shaved ice."}
{"text":"I had been on the search for a great Banh Mi for a really long time since moving to AZ I was lucky enough to be passing by when I noticed Banh Mi Bistro so I immediately made a U-Turn and stopped in. I had the pork banh mi sandwich along with an order of spring rolls. The Banh Mi was excellent the best I have had since living in AZ and would definitely be back for another. Bread was crunchy, buttery as it should be. Pork was seasoned and cooked perfectly and all the veggie fixings were fresh. The spring rolls on the other hand were just ok and had a bit too much of a fishy funk smell for my liking and the peanut sauce was a bit to watery for my liking as well. Overall solid place if you're looking for a killer banh mi sandwich."}
{"text":"Very fresh bread.  Good taste.  Drink is a tad too expensive but I guess they need to make money somehow.  I wish they have one closer to Tempe where I live.  Lee's sandwich is not nearly as good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's been great both times. The owner is really friendly and service was quick. The first time I came I got the noodle salad bowl which you can't really mess up but the fish sauce that came with was really good which is probably the most important part. This time I got a classic banh mi and my friend got a shaken beef and we split it. The sandwiches were really good I really liked the pate in the classic. It's a really far drive but I'll make it again."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good Vietnamese food since moving here a couple years ago, and this place is decent, but nothing to brag about. I got the classic banh mi, Vietnamese coffee and the shaken beef for my kiddos. My banh mi was ok. The jalapeños were super thin and flavorless because of it. It was slightly dry, but overall I would rate the sandwich itself 4 out of 5 stars. The shaken beef was tasty but way too oily. The forks were covered in oil after eating and my kids had greasy lips. The container the food came in is shiny all over because of the oil and the rice is mostly drenched in it. Will probably not get it again. The coffee was above average. Bottom line, will I come back? Not on purpose. It's definitely not a destination, but somewhere I would eat just out of convenience. Should have gone to Naked BBQ a few doors down."}
{"text":"Love this place! My guy introduced me to Bahn Mi's when we are at a Vietnamese restaurant once. I decided to google bahn Mi's in my area and this place came up! I've had the classic bahn mi and the pulled pork. Both are delicious! All of the different veggies and sauces really make them unique and delicious! I got the taro milk tea with boba. It's really good! The sandwiches are big, almost footlongs. I recommend adding their chili garlic sauce that you can find by their soda machine. It really gives that extra kick! Service has been both fast and friendly each time. Inside is very clean and I love how it is decorated. Definitely give this place a try! The next one I want to try is with the fried egg. I've read great reviews about it and have seen many people ordering it both times I went. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have gone here for lunch two days in a row and am love!! The firecracker salmon rolls and spring rolls are amazing! Loved the classic and BMB special are great sandwiches and are only $6 a piece! I tried a few specialty drinks but the taro smoothie with boba is my favorite. The coconut shaved ice is pretty fantastic too! The customer service is top notch and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Very, very yummy. First time in. I had the Shaken Beef Sandwich and it was excellent. Add in top of that a comfortable modern environment and very friendly service and you get a five star rating."}
{"text":"Wow, this is actually the second place in Phoenix where I had surprisingly solid Vietnamese food in the past few months. That isn't such a monumental discovery for anyone who actually lives in Phoenix, but for the hopeless San Francisco food snob that I am, it does please me to have choice in the midst of the sometimes scalding weather here. Funny thing is that they have \"No Pho\" signs on the wall, so don't even think about asking for it here. No, they are focused on noodle bowls, rice plates and banh mis, and yes, they're located in a strip mall next to Naked BBQ. Where else would they be in North Phoenix?  I came with a couple of colleagues who seemed to know what to order. One ordered the $8 Grilled Pork Noodle Salad Bowl which looked good enough for me to copy. It was a good-size bowl with plenty of rice vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, sliced cucumbers, pickled carrots, mint leaves, and of course, lettuce. It was topped with chopped scallions, crushed peanuts, and a sweet rice vinaigrette. You get two sides per order, so I went with the Deep-Fried Vegetable Egg Roll which was placed on top of the bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/2fbznV5). And then the Spring Roll stuffed with pork, shrimp, noodles, and vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/2fPMhcL).  It was hearty, fresh, crunchy when it was supposed to be, and certainly at the same level of similar bowls I would find back in the Bay Area with far less of a queue at the lunch hour. My other colleague went with the Grilled Shrimp Salad without the noodles but with plenty of bean sprouts, and she assured me she didn't miss the noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/2gancx3). I needed some libation in that sticky climate, so I had a $3.50 Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk which basically hit the spot (photo: http://bit.ly/2gclDO4), even though I had plenty of caffeine in my system from all the meetings in the morning. Nice to know there are options beyond the IHOP and the Tilted Kilt Pub in Phoenix.  FOOD - 4 stars...fresh, abundant takes on Vietnamese standards...but please, no pho AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...gee, it's a strip mall...what do you expect?...it's clean though SERVICE - 3 stars...nothing to write home about but they accommodate special orders TOTAL - 4 stars...surprising what you can find in a strip mall"}
{"text":"When I first went to Banh Mi Bistro, I could not believe that a Banh Mi cost $6-8. Growing up, the sandwich was $2-4, so the steep price difference baffled me. But with the great reviews, I was willing to try it and I am so glad I did. Since that first time I have been back too many times to count.  I usually order #7 Shaken Beef Banh Mi. The beef has always been tender and flavorful and the bread toasty and light. The sandwich is the size of two regular banh mi put together, so it is worth the cost.   The Lotus Root Salad and Green Papya Salad are both refreshing and light. And the Noodle Salad Bowls with grilled pork or grilled chicken is also tasty and filling. Banh Mi Bistro also has a stamp card so after 10 sandwich you can get one free.  What I recommend: -- #7 Shaken Beef Banh Mi"}
{"text":"No Pho!  Or should it be Nuh Pho?  Regardless, it was great to find good Banh Mi in Phoenix, and not just typical fillings (though they do have them).  I get the Shaken Beef Banh Mi - unique and very tasty.  Nice assortment of sides - I had Green Papaya salad, which had lots of real sliced shrimp, a nice spin on a Thai classic.  Thai tea Boba, and I was a happy guy.  Definitely worth a try - and if you're early enough, hit Lamars for a donut dessert (right across the parking lot)."}
{"text":"I live in North Phoenix and there aren't many options for Asian food around here when compared to the east valley, so when I saw the sign pop up I had to stop by. I ordered the BMB Special sandwich which consists of grilled pork, pate, fried egg, jalapeño, pickled daikon and carrot. The sandwich was amazing. The bread was soft and chewy with a nice crust and the pork was really flavorful.  The service was nice and fast.  Also an added bonus is that they have frequent purchasing cards for both drinks and sandwiches where you buy 10 drinks and/or sandwiches and get the 11th for free. I'll definitely be a returning customer even if they didn't have this perk. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  This place rocks!  It's Vietnamese Crack! I use that term with full praise :) I've eaten here 3 times.  I've had the #1, 2, and 7.  All excellent.  But the #2 with the fried egg was awesome :)))) Followed by the #7 Shaken beef.   The french bread is excellent and the sandwiches will leave you full and satisfied, unlike a certain unnamed competitor(large grocery store) in the east valley.  I'm gonna bug the owner until he opens a location up in the EV :)))))"}
{"text":"Great VN food, clean and comfortable dining room, reasonable prices and nice staff.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This family owned place is AMAZING! Wherever you are, it's worth the drive! The Banh Mi (I love the pork one) is even better than the ones in Little Saigon/So. Cal! And this is coming from someone who grew up in OC. The pickled vegetables are thicker so it's crunchier, they load you up with the cilantro and veggies. All the ingredients are very fresh!  Warning: They close Sunday's!   Thank you Banh Mi Bistro for the delicious Vietnamese food! Wishing you guys continual success and to someday open in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of their banh mi! It's freshly made with good grilled pork. The bread isn't too crunchy that it hurts the tough of my mouth. Their shave snow is not so great. It's alright. The shaved snow isn't that flavorful. The toppings of the shaved snow are good. The fried dumplings are good."}
{"text":"Best banh mi in the valley, hands down! I'm from the Bay Area and it's been a struggle finding a good banh mi out here. I've lived in Phoenix for two years before I stumbled into banh mi bistro & boy do I regret it. A lot of Vietnamese restaurants either run out of the baguettes or try to pass some stale ones off. BMB did not disappoint. Their bread here is super crispy and soft on the inside, stuffed with goodness on the inside.  I got the #2 bmb classic - this is a must try. They got it down with a generous serving of grilled pork, fried egg with a perfect ratio of pickled veggies, fresh cilantro and thinly sliced jalapeños. I was pretty stuffed halfway thru the sandwich but managed to finish the whole thing in one sitting because it was so good. 5 stars, I'll be back *Arnold voice*"}
{"text":"The majority of the menu is priced at $5.00 each, portions are large and the majority of the food is delicious. This is a small family ran casual business that specializes in the Banh Mi sandwich and more. You order up at the counter and seat yourself.   On my last visit I enjoyed the fresh crisp lotus root salad and the chicken banh mi. The chicken banh mi sandwich was really delicious and packed with tasty crisp vegetables. Portions were much larger than I was expecting and I took half home for latter.  This time we shared some vegetable egg rolls. They were different and unlike any other egg roll I ever had. You get lettuce leaves, fresh herbs cucumber and radish carrot salad to wrap around the egg rolls and then you dip them in a light fish sauce. They were the most interesting and the most delicious egg rolls I ever had.  For my meal I had the chicken and tofu vegetable bun. The bun is a salad made with lots of noodles. You have a choice of two toppings for your bun. The chicken was nicely seasoned but was very dry in my salad. I actually liked the tofu very much. It was marinated and flavorful. The way they prepared the tofu you could mistake it for moist chicken in this salad.   My husband had the classic banh mi this time. He liked it and wants to eat his way threw all the banh mi's on the menu. He is very interested in the meatball banh mi.  I like that this place offers something very different and unique to this area.  A solid good place to eat!  I do recommend to call in advance for opening hours if you're traveling to visit Banh Mi Bistro because they do occasionally close for special events as they did last Saturday."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for FAST, GOOD Vietnamese food. Their portions are HUGE. So far I've had their banh mi special with the BBQ pork and fried egg, banh mi cubed filet beef, and their vermicelli with pork egg roll and BBQ pork! If you don't know what to order, order one of those three! The vermicelli bowl was massive... so much meat not even kidding! Usually other viet restaurants are sooo skimpy, this place is NOT skimpy!!! Their banh mi bread is very unique compared to other chains such as Lees, banh mi bistros bread is very crispy and slightly thinner than lees and I def prefer it more! Did I mention the banh Mi is also HUgE! I could only finish half.. but it does make a good snack for later!  I've taken my classmates who are knew to viet food and they all love it! Thank you banh mi bistro for giving us our viet food fix!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! This place was so delicious. The bread was nice and crunchy and the veggies were fresh! We got the grilled chicken and the bmb. We also got the potstickers which were the best I've ever had. If we lived closer, we would come here all the time."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for Vietnamese grubs. No pho available but that's ok. Their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and rice plates are still worth the visit. They also have this peach ginger iced tea that is my favorite thirst quencher! Soooo satisfying (if you're not afraid of the distinct ginger taste)! Wish I could order this by the gallon lol. This place is on the higher end of the price spectrum, but I'm comparing it to a city that has an \"Asian town\" where banh mi is sold at every corner. It's got a nice modern twist but still has the authentic Vietnamese ingredients. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Average bahn mi sandwiches...  Nothing special about the ones at this place.. I can probably make one that tastes the same at home, no offense."}
{"text":"Great clean place. It opened about 4 months ago. It is more of a panera feeling place, not a restaurant with waiters. Friendly accommodating staff, great prices for the banh mis. Ordered #7 (the steak banh mi) it was warm and delicious. My husband ordered the classic, great flavor. The potstickers were also very good. This has become one of my favorite places to visit. Just FYI, the banh mis are very big, I believe they are more than 12 inches long."}
{"text":"A Great Find  Banh Mi Bistro is a small but fast/casual eatery. You place your order at the counter and seat yourself, then wait for your number to be called.  Prices are very reasonable and the portions are large. They specialize in Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwiches however, they also serve salads, appetizers, noodle bowls, Vietnamese beverages and frozen desserts.  On this visit we had the shaken beef rice plate, grilled pork rice bowl, and eggrolks. Everything was delicious. I couldn't believe how tasty are.entrees were and how large the portions were. I had to take half home.   This is a new favorite.  If you're in the area give Banh Mi Bistro a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is fantastic. Everything I've tried is so good but the Shaken Beef is my go-to. It's ridiculous. Staff is awesome - super nice."}
{"text":"I have had Banh Mi from various Vietnamese restaurants but the main reason I go to those restaurants is for the pho. Well you will not find any pho here. They specialize in banh mi and boy, do they ever! The sandwiches are to-die-for and are a very generous portion for the price. And it doesn't end there, before the main course we also tried the egg rolls. These were some of the best I have had. And the fish sauce is amazing! It is a highly underrated condiment and the fish sauce here is unique with a slight spice to it. So good! We gobbled up the food so quickly I forgot to snap a picture but I did remember by the time we ordered dessert. If you have never had shaved snow you are missing out! I highly recommend the taro with toppings of your choice (I went with the tapioca boba, fresh strawberries, and condensed milk glaze). The place itself is a little unassuming from the outside as it is in a small strip mall off the I-17. But once you step inside it is nicely decorated, clean and full of very nice people. There is a family feel to the service.  If the only Vietnamese cuisine you have tried is the trendy pho, give banh mi a chance and try out this place!"}
{"text":"They serve boba tea and just opened today 12/16/14 really clean and modern look people were nice"}
{"text":"The best noodle bowl in town.  I had the grilled pork and pork egg roll with the noodle bowl.  Very fresh and tasty.  Grilled pork was just right,  Not over cooked nor dry.  The pork egg roll was very fresh.  Very hard to get fresh tasting Vietnamese egg rolls like that around town.  Service was very fast.  My noodle was ready in less than 5 minutes.  These are dry noodle bowls (bun - vermicelli).  I didn't try to banh mi due to all the bad reviews I read about it.  Plus I'm not a banh mi guy anyway.  The 5 stars is the for noodle bowl, so fresh it tastes like fresh home made.    Update (after several visits a week for 5 weeks).  I tried their grilled pork chop rice plate (com dia suong nuong).  Delicious.  Another 5 stars.  Very healthy and fresh tasting too.  The meat was nicely seasoned and the rice was perfectly cooked.  The green papaya salad and lotus rood salad are also the bomb.  So good and healthy.  I normally get the eggroll noodle bowl.  Update 12/29/2016: It seem that in the last several months, they changed the ingredients in their eggrolls.  I can no longer say these are the best Vietnamese eggrolls in town, but they are still alright."}
{"text":"The best Banh Mi we've had since visiting Vietnam. One of the owners is from central Vietnam so the food is authentic. High-quality and fresh ingredients. The Banh Mi was big enough for two of us to share and at $6 a huge bargain. Had the BMB Special which had grilled pork, fried egg and pate in addition to the fresh toppings. The Green Papaya Salad was also delicious with a few shrimp on top. I wish this place was in my neighborhood, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions and the sandwiches have been really tasty. They are big enough to share, but could use more meat. The big issue I have is that I have tried to go eat there and it was closed earlier than their posted time on more than one occasion.  I don't want to go to a place where I have to call first to make sure they're open. Pretty inconvenient, especially for people who drive far to eat there.  :/"}
{"text":"Picked up from here for dinner last night. I was excited to try it because of all the great reviews the place has received although Yelp reviewers have recently steered me on wrong with great reviews, \"Tommy's Place\". I'M STILL SAYING WTF!!? However, this restaurant delivered greatly. I ordered the shaken beef sandwich, the lemongrass pork sandwich, and their wings. The sandwiches are huge. They were a lot bigger than I anticipated. I packed my bags and took a trip to Flavor Town because their sandwiches were loaded with them. The flavors or so exquisite and complex. This is a new level of sandwich making. They have such a wide variety of choices on the menu that go beyond just sandwiches. My only knock on the place are the wings. I ordered them extra crispy and they weren't really crispy at all. Next time I'll have to tell them I want to be able to throw my wings through a wall. Torch the damn things!"}
{"text":"Green tea shaved ice with fresh mango is so good!!! Can't wait to go back to try their pho and other dishes.  5 stars for their service."}
{"text":"Ok so I have never eaten here to any Vietnamese place.  Not my type of food.  Let me say, when I walked in the smell was AMAZING!  I was ready to eat for sure!  I got their noodle bowl with chicken and shrimp.  I paid $12 with drink.  I was disappointed I only got 3 shrimp.  Outside of that, the food was very good and very flavorful.  I plan on returning"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge.  The classic banh mi tastes awesome and is very filling. The pork and shrimp spring rolls aren't too bad either.  I prefer this place over subway, jimmy johns and firehouse subs. If this place was closer i would hit it up more often."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Maroon 5 - Sugar)  I don't wanna be hungry for lunch I just wanna be eating your food And it's killing me when I'm hungry ooh, Bo Bites Cause I really don't care where you are I just wanna be there when you open And I gotta get one little taste  Banh Mi Yes, please Won't you come and make some for me? I'm right here, 'cause I need Little spice and a lot of fresh veggies Yeah, you serve me good coffee Make it alright Need a little Banh Mi for my bite Banh Mi Yes, please Won't you come and make some for me?  No PHO FO sure!  I'm very happy to see Banh Mi Bistro try to educate the valley about Banh Mi sandwiches and Vietnamese cuisine which doesn't only encompasses the one and only - Pho!  Banh Mi Bistro showcases traditional Banh Mi along with other  sandwiches with more recognizable ingredients.    I went for the traditional Banh Mi; a French baguette with pickled carrots, daikon, cilantro, jalapeno, and Vietnamese ham and pate.  The bread was extra flaky and crunchy the way it should be while the cilantro and pickled vegetables brought a soothing and aromatic bite!  The sandwich itself is about 12 inches long so sharing is not a bad idea especially if you plan to get other items.  The second time I came around I went for the Noodle Bowl with pork and eggrolls.  Overall, a solid dish with fresh cut cucumbers, romaine lettuce, crispy eggrolls and Vietnamese seasoned pork served with a sweet and spicy hot sauce.  I like mines with a bit of a kick so I added some Siracha.  The bowl itself is well portioned in my opinion; not too much and not too less.  I also ordered me the Vietnamese ice coffee; a potent caffeinated coffee with condensed milk be prepared to stay away!   In the end, the place was clean and modern.  The service and staff seemed very genuine and helpful educating their patrons along with welcoming back regular customers.  Overall and A+ from Bo Bites! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. The food was so fresh, very well seasoned and delicious. I continue to dream about returning and I was only there two days ago! I have never had shaved ice and decided to give it a try. I am now hooked. We had the Bun, Bun Mi, taro boba, mango ice cream and shaved ice. All were 100 percent delicious and highly recommended. Excited to make this a regular lunch/dinner spot with the family."}
{"text":"Good to see a small and unique to-go/sit down restaurant that is actually focused on consistency and good food. The \"No Pho\" sign at the counter is hysterical, but this only tells me one thing, they have a focused menu that doesn't try to do too much.   It's alway the same gent at the till. Always courteous, and in his 'Niners hat. Looks like he actually runs the show there, good to see customer service consistency.  Why Go There: The classic Banh Mi, listed as #1 on the menu. It's got a good kick so you may need to ask them to hold the spicy peppers. I was advised that their bread has taken forever to craft to the right texture and feel of the proper Banh Mi baguette. It doesn't destroy the roof of your mouth, it's crunchy but soft on the inside. Made offsite, these scrumptious vessels come from a bakery here in the Valley. The ribeye Banh Mi is also outstanding. The price point for everything is spot on, perfect for a hefty lunch (mostly under $7).  Don't Miss: the Vietnamese coffee.  It's a staple, as well as the fresh squeezed OJ. The Vietnamese Spring Rolls, are taste very authentic and are well priced.   Overall: It's a gem. The place is always busy, sure wish there were more of these in the Valley, bit of a weird location."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fresh and delicious Vietnamese. They make the BEST Banh-mi and Bun in town. Hands down 5 stars. The owner is so friendly and welcoming and the prices are reasonable. My favorite items are Shaken beef Banh mi, BMB special, and Bun with grilled pork and pork egg roll. Never had a negative experience at Banh-mi Bistro!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out and finally did when we were shopping nearby. We ordered the chicken banh mi, shaken beef bang mi, chicken salad bowl, and coconut smoothie boba. The sandwiches were huge! Well worth the price. The salad were good as well. I love the coconut smoothie boba the most!  I definitely would recommend this place.   FYI...the owner of this place said his parents own Little Saigon restaurant in Glendale. Good cooking runs in the family."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and for my money, this is the best Bahn mi in AZ! I can't help but make a stop here when I'm down in Phoenix. The egg rolls are pretty damn tasty too. If your on the fence, I suggest you hop off, and give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I tried the number 2 and everything about this sandwich was unbelievable. I wasn't sure about the liver spread that is used on this sandwich, but I couldn't even taste it. The flavors really compliment each other. The other members of my party tried different sandwiches and they all looked great. I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and this is the best Vietnamese food I've had in Phx. clean and bright interior. easy to read menu board. They have signs that say \"no pho\". Food was very fresh. Salad dressing is really good. I got the Bun thit nüong and it was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is an Americanized bahn mi place.  I ordered the #1 which seems to be closest to the banh mi's I'm used to eating.  The guy at the counter said \"You know that's the deli meat one\" as if to warn me.  Eating banh mi and drinking Vietnamese coffee was a lunchtime passion for me for many years.  I was super excited to see that they had the drip Vietnamese coffee pictured on their menu board.  Of course I ordered it to go with my sandwich.  After my number was called, I got what is probably the largest bahn mi I've seen.  Perhaps it was due to the size of the sandwich but it was pretty much all pickled veggies, which is great if you love a pickled carrot sandwich, but whatever meat that was in there was lost.  I couldn't even drown my sorrows with the Vietnamese coffee.  Instead of watching it drip and being able to pour it over ice to cap my meal, they deliver it already made.  Such a disappointment.    I had a couple of appetizers as well and they weren't too bad.  Place was a bit dirty but nothing serious.  Probably the best part about this place is the prices, although bahn mi's are traditionally inexpensive."}
{"text":"Clean, well organized and easy to read menu. Food was awesome with generous amounts of ingredients! We ordered egg rolls, #2 (grilled pork and fried egg) and #7 (rib eye), plus two green milk tea boba.   All the meat was so tender and well marinated, the bread was perfectly baked and the pickled veggies (carrots and daikon) were crisp and tasty. Unfortunately, can't change the level of sweetness for the milk teas...still delicious and the boba was nice and chewy!  This place has been here for 2 years and I can't believe I haven't been here before! As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was in LA!!"}
{"text":"An excellent Vietnamese cafe.  You order at a counter and eat at a table or take out.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Food quality is excellent.  The meat portion in the bowls could be better.  Everything was flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"Came here today on the recommendation of some friends. I will be returning soon.  Pros: Clean, bright, unpretentious setting Hospitable man at register Delicious sandwich (#7 shaken beef) Huge portion at a reasonable price  Cons:  none"}
{"text":"My first and only bahn mi experience so far, but I really enjoyed it and have been back three times and always get the same thing - the lemongrass pork bahn mi. The cashier recommended it when I asked what to get, saying it was his favorite, and I've never looked back. Very fresh and tasty. Also, they have a few tiny tables out front so I can bring my pup with. They always offer me a bowl of water to give her. Very thoughtful."}
{"text":"Every bite of every dish served at this family owned and operated treasure is perfection. You think I'm kidding?! No. It really is. The bahn mi is on the most sublime bread I've ever had with a crusty crust and tender chewy inside. The veggies are crisp and fresh and the meats are cooked to perfection. The sandwich portions are very generous but there's no compromise between quality and quantity here. You get both. Every single time.   If you're not feeling the bahn mi today, or you are looking for something new to try the noodle salad bowl is . Cold rice noodles, salad, cucumber, cilantro, and magical (fish sauce?) dressing topped with pork, shrimp and a spring roll is sure to hit the spot.   Sometimes when I go in I'm overwhelmed by delicious options so I spurge and get a few sides as my lunch. I'm into all of the sides but the cold salad rolls are my fave.   Finally, and this is essential, you do not want to miss dessert. Vietnamese coffee, boba tea, avocado smoothies, and shaved ice snow are all to die for here.   Seriously, go here. And if you happen to hit the growing lunch crowd, be patient because they're making magic in that (clean, open, delightful) kitchen."}
{"text":"Very good and love the ice Vietnamese coffee with the sweet condensed milk and the BBQ pork Hong Kong style. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered #2 BMB special and green papaya salad. The food was tasty and fresh. I was left unimpressed by the salad and would not order again, but our sandwich was quite good. The portions were enough to split with my husband.  Establishment extremely clean inside and employees were all very friendly. Taro boba tea was delicious"}
{"text":"So good, you'll want to awkwardly hug the cook!! This place is tucked between a Good Feet Store and a Plumbing office! Right across from some car dealerships.   Best Vietnamese Egg Rolls I've ever had!! I used to live in Little Saigon with my ex and can recall my his mother making them from scratch. At the time I thought none, could surpass hers.   I.Was.Wrong. (Sorry Mrs.Tran)   Bahn Mi's eggs rolls were crispy, not greasy Exceptionally tasty, light yet satisfying. I will always order an order to share every time I go in.   Enough about the egg rolls, let's talk....Bahn Mi The bread was crusty and soft, the pork I had was flavored with lemon grass which was aromatic, and thinly sliced charred to perfection. All if it was topped with pickled daicon, fresh cilantro leaves, pickled carrots, and thin jalapenos. All very fresh tasting.   The iced coffee was a delight too! Creamy, sweet and strong! I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my wife and daughter.  I had the noodle bowl with pork and an egg roll and it was great!  Plenty of food for the money.  This place is very clean and modern.  Its close to my and I am very happy for that as I will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"This was a great find. The food is great and the price is good for the amount of food you get. I ordered one of their rice noodle bowls, and it was more then expected.  Will have to visit this place again. The place has a nice atmosphere too.   So go check it out!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum and YUM! The spring rolls with pork and shrimp are amazing, and the Banh Mi are GREAT! I got the grilled pork and it didn't disappoint! It was fast, the service is wonderful and the place is really cute! I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  No pho, and the Banh Mi is off the hook!  Huge sandwiches that are sooo fresh and they've got lots of yummy boba teas and smoothies. I keep saying I'm going to try their ice cream dessert, but I can't stop ordering my staple: lemongrass pork banh mi, deep fried egg rolls, and milk tea with boba. Authentic thru and thru."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My family and I were very impressed. They didn't have a lot if gluten free options since all the meat is marinated in soy sauce, but I got the vegetarian noodle bowl (rice noodles, tofu, and veggies with the standard vinegarette dressing). I loved it and would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi's are awesome! The boba teas are great and the service is quick and friendly! The place is small but clean! I've always ordered takeout though so I'm not entirely sure how the service would be staying!"}
{"text":"The reviews weren't wrong. Great food and the restaurant and bathrooms were very clean and nicely decorated. Staff was very friendly and professional. Eat here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the #2 BMB special and it has amazing and huge although surprisingly light as the bread is not heavy.  I am not a bread guy but the bread alone was great and then with all the amazing things they put on it...with a little of the homemade chili garlic sauce on it....it is a home run!  I didn't order the pan fied dumplings but they looked huge as well.  I would drive the 15 miles it took me to get there anytime.  Really one of the best, unique sandwiches I have ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place... Clean, the service is awesome and the food is amazing. My favorite is the grilled pork noodle salad bowl.  Try it you'll thank me"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and I finally did. I ordered the Shaken Beef Banh Mi $7 and Bun with grilled pork and pork eggroll $8. I have to say that both were flavorful and just the flavor I was looking for. The Shaken Beef Banh Mi has a combination of sweet and sour flavor. The sweet from the beef and sour/sweet from the pickled daikon radish and carrots. The cucumber and the cilantro adds to the flavor along with a small kick from a thinly sliced jalapeno on top. The bread is fresh and crunchy and it stayed that way even though I picked it up twenty minutes after they said it will be ready for pick up.   The Bun was perfect with right amount of noodles, veges, and they didn't skimp out on the meat. The meat was very flavorful. I didn't get to try the eggroll since my 2 year old son ate it all. Obviously he loved it though. The noodle was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just right amount and not overly sweet!   So to sum it all up, I recommend this place. The  price is reasonable and the portion is just right. Now remember, this place does not serve Pho."}
{"text":"Eating a sandwich at Banh Mi Bistro is an experience full of flavor and texture. The kind that makes go \"mmm..\" with your eyes closed as you take a bite.  The meat is savory and the baguette is fresh, but soft enough that the crust doesn't tear up your palate like most baguette sandwiches do. The space is bright, well-designed, and there's a positive, friendly atmosphere when you walk in.   The successful combination of simplicity and quality makes this place a gem, even in their early beginning as a small, family-owned Vietnamese eatery.  I only wish there was a Banh Mi Bistro near my house."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich, friendly and helpful service, nice and clean location.  I just moved to the area and had left behind me one of my favorite restaurants ever in the form of a Vietnamese restaurant with insanely good banh mi. I had a craving for banh mi, but I was really concerned that anything else would disappoint me. I saw Banh Mi Bistro with high ratings, so I decided to give it a shot. I even drove way too far during my lunch break to do it. I am glad that I did!  When I got here, I was thinking I'd get some spring rolls and a sandwich to get an idea of how good this place is. I ordered the spring rolls and, with the assistance of the guy taking orders, the BMB Special. He said that the BMB Special and one other sandwich are ones that Banh Mi Bistro does differently from other places. When I saw that there was a fried egg involved, I was sold.  My food came out, and I immediately began to question how well I'd feel after eating this meal. It wasn't a question of whether I'd finish, just how I'd feel afterwards. The sandwiches are huge! I dug into the spring rolls first. The pork inside them was great, and the overall flavor with the peanut sauce was excellent. I could have made a meal out of these things alone, and considering their size, I don't think it would be too much out of the question.  On to the sandwich, the scene stealer. There was grilled pork on there, and it was delicious. The cilantro, jalapenos, and other veggies were all excellent. And as I thought it would, the fried egg stole my heart. This is a pretty darn good sandwich, and it made me know that I gotta come back here for more.  I'm reserving a fifth star for trying a few more of the sandwiches. Like I said, my expectations for banh mi are pretty darn high, so this place has high standards with which to deal. But I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Love this place, authentic and zesty"}
{"text":"Delicious bang mi's! Only problem was they filled it with so much meat after the first bite the bread fell apart. Very friendly staff and everything tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"Clean? Check! Cute inside? Check!  Amazing food? MEGA CHECK!  Hungry, I got the BBQ Pork Banh Mi, pork pot stickers and a MANGO SMOOTHIE with boba.   I never had boba, but liked it. The smoothie was worth the trip.  My mouth is still on fire from the peppers in the sandwiches, but by far the best sandwich I've ever had. Fresh toppings and a nice, clean taste."}
{"text":"Have been looking for Bahn Mi. Found extremely affordable and fantastically tasty!!! I was so pleasantly surprised.... I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Back to the Bistro for a banh mi fix.  Staff are always pleasant.  Ordered the #4 and #5, which are the grilled chicken and BBQ pork banh mi.  Quick service as well usual.   The baguette was toasted perfectly.  Both banh mis were delicious.  Thanks to the Bistro for another great meal!   I suppose every restaurant has their off days. Today was one of them for Banh mi Bistro.    The gentleman who usually takes our order was not there today. Instead we had a young lady take our order. She was very pleasant.  We ordered the number 4 and number 8 sandwich. The food came out quickly and were clearly marked so that we knew which sandwich was which.  The baguette was extra toasted and super crunchy. I like mine a little less toasted. We had to work to bite into the sandwich.  The ingredients were still ample.  I love the pickled Daikon and carrots in the sandwich. Despite the bread being overly toasted, the food was still good and the service was fast. It is exceptionally clean in there.   We had a yen for Bánh mì.  Ordered the #4 & 5; grilled chicken and BBQ pork.  Service is always quick with the freshest of ingredients.  This time the bread was toasted perfectly.   It is a 12\" sandwich.   Help yourself to Sriracha and hoisin sauce and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, super nice staff and reasonable priced. Simple"}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas and back at home, banh mi is $3.50. Upon looking at the menu and discovering the banh mis here were $6-7 I was like \"uh uh....\"   When I first walked into this place, I noticed there were no vietnamese people...which is usually a sign that the food is bad (if it's a vietnamese restaurant, obviously). But really, it's probably just because my fellow, cheap Vietnamese peoples are not down with paying over $5 for a banh mi sandwich.   I got the BMB (banh mi dac biet) and upon receiving it, I realized why it was $7 (should be $6 in my opinion)...this massive sandwich was the size of my entire forearm down to my fingertips. Definitely a Pauline P. sized banh mi - it's about 1.5x the size of a normal banh mi. Back at home, I can eat 2 banh mis and that's about $7 anyways. The grilled pork is very flavorful and you can see them grilling it right then and there. I love that it's made to order. The egg is really what makes the sandwich. The egg was fried to perfection and the runny yolk is what makes this sandwich awesome. Unfortunately, what was missing for me is the big glob of the buttery mayo that I'm used to in a typical banh mi. Oh well, it was still a great sandwich.  Pass on the egg rolls, guys. They are subpar."}
{"text":"Ordered the BmB special.  It's legit.  Clean restaurant and quick service.  Great food for the price.  Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Yummm! First time here and loved it ! We got salmon rolls / the steak sandwich & a Taro Smoothie  all very delicious !"}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix, highly recommend Bánh Mì Bistro. We're visiting Phoenix from CA, the hub of Viet foods with countless bánh mì shops. This shop makes ones of the best Viet sandwiches and cofee I've ever had #1 bánh mì tht ngui & #3 bánh mì tht heo nuong are so good and HUGE! Beats CA standard by far!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this place.  Some of our friends recommended to us.  We both had their Noodle Salad Bowls which includes two sides.  I chose the Grilled Pork and the Pork Egg Roll sides and my wife chose the Grilled Chicken and the Pork Egg Roll.  We also ordered their Spring Roll small sides. The food was really good and was prepared in just a few minutes. The Spring rolls were huge and really tasty.  The service was exceptional and very friendly. We noticed many customers coming in appeared to be regulars as they interacted with the staff.  The place was spotless and well organized.  Needless to say, we'll be back here more often."}
{"text":"We have had the pleasure of dining here three or four times in the last six months. We have tried something different each visit and have never been disappointed. Their salads are flavorful and crunchy fresh. They have a variety of sandwiches from which to choose. My favorite is the lemongrass pork although the shaken beef is very good too. The BUN (noodle salad bowls) are delicious as well. Always fresh, tasty and presented nicely, you really should try this place. I'm certain you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"What more can I say than what has already been posted. Best bánh mì I have ever had. If you are a fan of Vietnamese hole in the wall places,  go here and order their special sandwiches,  you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Never disappointed! I love it during the holidays when the shut down and care more about their staff than profit! I'm sad because I can't get my coffee or green papaya salad... but I'm grateful for employers who know how to treat their staff! Keep it up-place is always clean and the food is fresh and delicious! A must visit!"}
{"text":"YAYYYYYY for this spot! Directly across the street from work, and we love it! We LOVE the owners too! Always friendly, helpful and ALWAYS recognizes the regulars! (Yes, that would be me)  Every time we stop in, we grab the Vegetarian Salad Noodle Bowl with Veggie Rolls and a Vietnamese Coffee. YUM YUM YUM! Every single thing you order is always fresh, and served with love! This is honestly one of my all-time favorite things to eat ever! The bowl is bomb every time, and if you have never had Vietnamese Coffee before, you are truly missing out on life."}
{"text":"You get a hugeeee banh mi sandwich for such a great price!  Banh mi is the best lunch food when you're sick of the usual sandwich and salad.    I highly suggest the BMB Special.  I go crazy for anything that has egg in it and this was no exception.  We got sandwiches for takeout and service was quick.  Just be sure to grab your own utensils because they just had you the sandwiches in a plastic bag."}
{"text":"Last week I visited and the gentleman behind the counter walked a friend and I through the ordering process. I order the Pork Rice plate and Potstickers. The meal value is great but sides and drinks are expensive at 3 to 5 dollars. I visited again yesterday with my wife. She had the Pork Noodles and loved it. I had the same as before. Many people seemed like locals and the restaurant was EXCEPTIONALLY clean. Will be going there many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Great value, delicious food, friendly service, modern atmosphere. You can get sandwiches, soup, salads, rice plates and Boba! I recommend the Shaken beef - incredible! Energetic but quiet enough for conversation!"}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork and also shewn beef sandwiches.... This restaurant has a great atmosphere, fantastic food and great service! Awesome new addition. I will be eating here often. Come try it out."}
{"text":"The banh mi here is absolutely delicious! Had the banh mi bo luc lac or shaken beef and the flavor was on point. I was so full from the sandwich! Would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick bite to eat during their lunch break! They have desserts and boba drinks too."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and they are not kidding no Pho.  I had the Banh Mi Shaken Beef.  Beef was tender and lightly seasoned which complemented the spices and sesame oil.  Vegetables and herbs were very fresh and flavorful.  The spring rolls are yummy the pork inside has a slight seasoning so it adds an extra level of flavor.  Love, love, love the peanut sauce with a touch of sriracha.    The Bun with grilled pork and egg roll is also very yummy.  We will be back"}
{"text":"The #2 BMB Special Vietnamese sandwich is an exceptionally tasty combination of ingredients nestled in a good French bread roll.  Also, all of the Bun noodle salad bowls are very tasty, light and refreshing.  I have tried several Vietnamese sandwich shops in San Diego, but none of them compare this this eatery!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm fat I've accepted it! This is another reason why. I've had sandwiches before but these a are bigger and fresher somehow. I go with the number five but recommend all of them. Had Thai Milk Tea with Boba. No room for dessert but next time. Just put one in your mouth already! No other sandwich place compare it's so unique."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese sandwiches I have ever had! And to top it off the guy who took our order (I'm pretty sure the owner) was so nice! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I need to try other things here as well, but their Classic Banh Mi was good. The bread was great, not too hard. The Pate was delicious, it's been awhile since i've had some good pate on a bahn mi. It actually brought me back to my days in seattle....but i won't start to compare that sandwich to this anyfurther. I feel like they could have been a little more generous in the construction/ingredients of the bahn mi...I mean overall though it was good. Glad to have a good bahn mi place close to my side of town. I hope to try more things on the menu soon."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try their Banh Mis for awhile.  Stopped by and enjoyed their BBQ pork sandwich.  Will try more again."}
{"text":"Everything tastes so good and so fresh here. You really can't go wrong with any of their menu items. The restaurant itself is very nice. Overall a perfect place."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Bistro currently has a lot of Yelp buzz - and with good reason. The food here far exceeded my initial expectations.  The restaurant itself is located right off of Bell and I-17, in the same plaza that houses the critically acclaimed Naked BBQ. You order at the counter and then, in turn, pick the food up at the counter when it's ready. However, don't let that setup deter you. The food itself is the equivalent of what can be obtained at any respectable Vietnamese restaurant, if not better in many aspects.  My girlfriend prefers the chicken rice plate, while I usually opt for the shaken beef. Both orders come with white rice with a fried egg upgrade option, as well as a single eggroll and salad. Everything is excellent quality, including the meats, which we've had mixed experiences with as of late.  The shaved snow is just okay. For a six-dollar price with toppings, the portion is very generous. However, we've always preferred snow that steers a bit more on the creamier side rather than icy. It's still worth trying out.  As for the Banh Mi sandwiches they showcase: They're definitely good for what they are. I've only tried the shaken beef and might experiment in the future if I feel like being adventurous.   With food being this good, I see this as definitely being a place to add into rotation when the mood strikes for some Vietnamese-style food.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food Banh Mi for a great price!!! Wish they were opened a little later"}
{"text":"Great food. I was pleased to walk in and see the former managers of Little Saigon in downtown Glendale, so I had a feeling I wasn't going to be disappointed. My husband and I split a vermicelli noodle bowl and the Shaken banh mi. The ingredients were fresh and a wonderful mix of meat and veggies. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although I have only checked in here 2x I've  returned more than that amount after my 1st experience. Hoping my family does not read this and ask why I didn't bring them with me or why I did not bring some home.  I have loved everything I have eaten here thus far: egg rolls, spring rolls, potstickers, noodle salad bowls (various combinations) #1, #3, #4, #5, #8 fresh  squeezed limeade, mango smothie, and SNOW! Living in this hot desert climate you can imagine why the last mentioned is amazing as a dessert!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten too many Banh Mi sandwiches but this was the best by far. I ordered the shaken beef. Very fresh tasting ingredients and outstanding bread. The restaurant was very clean and modern. The service was very friendly. I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This is only my second visit, but I was impressed with the service, taste and quality of this place that I came the very next day to try something else. First visit, #5 Hong Kong BBQ Pork bánh mì with Thai Iced tea. 2nd visit shaken beef sandwich, #7.  Wowwww, that #7, was meary deliciousness. A must try! The service was just as friendly and prompt. Restaurant was clean and fully stocked in all areas with napkins, etc. Bathroom is super clean and even has a cute changing table. So far consistently good.  A 4 star rating only bc they don't have phô, but there are so many other options that I could get phô elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Great Bahn Mi!  Absolutely the best in Phoenix.  If you want a taste of Authentic Vietnamese sandwiches in the Valley this place is a must."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Bistro 2340 W. Bell Road Phoenix  Three of us went for lunch at this restaurant. It is located in a small strip center right near the freeway. Arriving early, we were able to get a table immediately, and spent some time perusing the menu.  Companion #1 ordered egg rolls (3 to an order), a meatball banh mi with tomato sauce, and a taro boba.  Companion #2 ordered a Hong Kong style pork banh mi and a drink.  I ordered the spring roll appetizer with peanut sauce, rib steak pieces, pepper & onions banh mi, and peach/ginger iced tea.  In a reasonable amount of time our orders were ready to be picked up at the counter.  Comments: Companion #1: egg rolls were crisp but on the small side. Came with enough lettuce and assorted veggies to make an entire lunch instead of just and appetizer. The meatball banh mi had little flavor but had so much jalapeno (possibly serrano) pepper as to make it inedible. Companion did not eat the rest of the sandwich. Taro boba was excellent.  Companion #2: Only ate  1/2 of sandwich because of burn from all the peppers on the sandwich. Gave me other half of sandwich and I gave companion  1/2 of my sandwich after opening it up and removing all peppers from it. Hong Kong pork was severely lacking in flavor.  My spring rolls were properly made, but the peanut sauce was almost flavorless. It looked proper, but the flavor just was not there. My sandwich was fair in flavor but lacking in meat. I added both soy sauce and a healthy squirt of chili/garlic sauce to the sandwich but it did not do much for it. Even the chili/garlic sauce was watered down in flavor. The ginger iced tea was very nice, but all teas are pre-sweetened, which can be a real problem for a diabetic.  Overall, the food seemed to lack flavor and assertiveness with the exception of heat from peppers. While I personally enjoy hot peppers, what was on the sandwiches was over powering of the flavor.  This was the first time I have ever had a banh mi that was so lacking in flavor. I would suggest that the restaurant reexamine their flavor profile and do some work on it.  The restaurant was clean and service was spot on.  2 stars for cleanliness and service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the world to eat banh mi. This hidden gem is tucked away in a small strip mall. Sandwiches are so delicious. Prices are just right and every penny is worth it. Each bite is full of flavor all ingredients are distributed evenly throughout the sandwich. So far I have tried the BMB, Shaken beef and BBQ pork sandwiches. If you like banh mi you will know what I mean about the ingredients. We have also tried most of the appetizers on their menu. We have done this because these items are so reasonably priced. Oh an did I forget to mention how mmm mmm good they are. I just love the pork belly buns. I have not yet tried the salad but I bet its bomb. I can't wait because its summer time the noodle salad bowl would be so refreshing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Potstickers were amazing. Crispy and the sauce that comes with it is delicious. Excellent customer service as well. Very friendly staff. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I really like their banh mi!!! It's the best in the West Valley!!! I don't like their shave snow. It's too bland."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest new places in town. When you come and eat you definitely wanna be a regular. Quick, Easy, and tasty.  Once you walk in your mouth will salivate of the rich aroma.  Vietnamese sandwiches is their game and they do it well. I have tried all the sandwiches and I keep coming back to the Grilled Pork aka Thit Nuong.  I call it \"Thit Nuonging it UP\". No question when you add cheese its a tidal wave of Asian goodness in the palm of your hands.  No mistake after the first bite you won't stop and soon it will be all gone! Bye Bye! Each bite is an explosion of fresh flavor you've never had but won't forget. Seriously its that good that it becomes YOUR possession and you won't dare to share it.  The fresh and zesty vegetables combined with the warm marinated pork with the melted cheese is just ridiculous. When you finish you will recite \"Damn that was good\" and catch yourself  looking up at the menu and wondering if I should get 2 more to go...  Once you receive  the handoff and the end of the counter, like a Running back reaching for the goal line you will protect  them at any cost!"}
{"text":"The best banh mi that I've had so far! I got the BMB special, number 2. The meat was very tender and it's got so much flavor to it, as I sink my teeth into the banh mi, the buttery texture of the over easy eggs melts into my mouth like heaven. Ahhhh soo good! But be careful! the jalapeno is hiding inside.. I almost cried! lol I took it out and continue eating my banh mi.. I also like their baguette it's not too hard and it doesn't hurt my upper palate. They also serve drinks here, the peach ginger iced tea and the passion fruit iced tea was awesome, we just didn't add boba to it because we already have boba in our shaved snow. The shaved snow was really good too, we added some lychee jelly and boba with condensed milk. If it's not too far from my house, I'd be here everyday and be broke."}
{"text":"The food is so bad I am writing this review while still at the restaurant.  I had noodle salad w/chicken bowl plus egg roll.  The egg roll was cold, greasy, mucky and all around disgusting.  Chicken was bland and over cooked to the point of almost impossible to chew.  My wife ordered noodle salad bowl w/pork.  Her pork was so coagulated with grease slime she could not eat it.  Then to top it off the table itself cut her leg because of jagged metal.  Add in the loud obnoxious noises and yelling from back kitchen and the whole experience was the worst I've experienced in Arizona.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: this place flat out rocks. I eat here 2 or 3 times a week for lunch. The rice noodle bowls are my mainstay for low cal, amazing flavor and healthy lunch. The shaved ice is awesome. The sandwiches are perfect. If you've never tried Bahn Mi - try it. Once you do, you'll be hooked. My fave lunch destination. And it's prices are reasonable, and food is cooked fresh and fast! If all restaurants were like this, no one in America would ever eat at home again. Ever."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese eatery in town!!  The potstickers alone are worth a trip to Banh Mi !! The baguettes they use are the real deal.  You can make a meal out of the appetizers they offer.  It's a 20 minute drive for me to eat here but, try to get here at least once a month, sometimes more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVEEEEEEEE this place!!! We go here at least 2-3 times a month. Their vegetarian Banh Mi is so good, my husband always gets the beef. Their spring rolls are bomb, and the lotus salad is really good too!! And they have boba tea, which is my favorite!! The girl that always takes our order is so nice, and remembers us every time we come in. I'm so glad we have a Banh Mi spot so close to our house!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and milk teas! My kids love it here and so do I. One of our favorites."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches, quick service, clean surroundings.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Just the best! Fresh and delicious. Not to mention you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Omg this is my new favorite place. Thumbs up on quality, portions and prices. Do not change a thing! Staff was friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Come here now! I've always been a fan of banh mi at other Vietnamese places but was always disapointed by small portions and limited selection. I came across this lovely little place while perusing yelp for something to eat, a constant personal struggle, and I saw the pictures. I didn't believe it! This is what I'm looking for! And this is what they do!!! And there is a sticker on the door \"NO PHO\" hahahaha great! I came in on a tuesday. Very decent lunch crowd. The establishment is unbelievably clean, spacious, and very modern looking (very surprised by the location). I was greeted by one of the owners, very friendly and helpful. The menu is perfect too! 8 banh mi options, appetizers, and salads. The food is delicious, flavorful, and fresh! I highly recommend #2 ,#3, #7 ($6-$7), and salmon firecracker rolls($4!!!!!) Top it off with some milk tea with boba!!! GO NOW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"High quality food! I came here wanting pork buns, and was not disappointed. Tried the bahn mi BBQ pork, and everything was so fresh and delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today during their soft opening. We asked John, the owner, to basically pick for us what we should eat for our first time. We were starving so we asked for 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes.  We had the Firecracker Salmon Rolls ($5), the Spring Rolls ($5), the Noodle Bowl with Pork (which is noodles and salad together, topped with the meat of your choice ($8), and the BBQ Pork Banh Mi (sandwich) ($5). Each item came with it's own sauce and we tried them all and even mixed them all at once with some of their red pepper flake chili sauce. You can't go wrong mixing those flavors.  Everything was DELICIOUS! It was fast casual Vietnamese food - healthy, fresh, and left us feeling satisfied and good about what we had put in our bodies.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is right off the I-17 behind the Lamar's Donuts. Try it (and all the sauces) and you will not be disappointed.  We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The \"bang mi\" tastes good and is a good size. I like to get the Hong kong style BBQ Banh Mi. I haven't tried the others yet. It's a very long sandwich.  Their noodle dish, healthier than I'm used to, is also pretty good. Their rice entrees are really good as well! Really liked the chicken rice entree.  Very nice people and good food! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good. Had the no.2 and the noodle bowl . Just excellent. Fresh. Large portions. Nicely decorated and very clean."}
{"text":"Don't let the large number of five-star reviews here concern you; they are legitimate! Fabulous sandwiches, friendly staff, low prices. There is zero atmosphere, if they are not busy it's as quiet as a library, but who cares when the food is so good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Everything is yummy and fresh. My favorite is the noodle salad with park and pork egg roll and I like to add Avocado. I also love their sandwiches, pot stickers, and coffee."}
{"text":"Who needs pho!? These banh mi sandwiches truly stand on their own and are so satisfying. Tucked away in a strip mall you wouldnt expect this level of flavor and finesse but this place really delivered.  We were the only ones in this bistro at 4pm on a friday and the place was extremely clean with contemporary asian decor and friendly staff. The menu is displayed above the counter subway style and theres plenty of variety and something for everybody. I ordered the vegetarian banh mi and springrolls and my husband got the beef and shrimp spring rolls and beef banh mi with xtra meat and a fried egg.   These sandwiches are big and packed with fresh ingredients! Flaky fresh baked french bread hugs a combination of pickled vegetables and cilantro with protein of choice and tangy sauce with undertones of cinnamon and asian spices. Mine had lemongrass marinated tofu and it is honestly the best sandwich i have ever had in my life. Umami! My husbands had tender beef cooked a perfect medium rare with creamy yolk from the fried egg seeping into the bread creating its own savory addition. He said it was the best he ever had as well. Spring rolls were still warm showing they were fresh and made to order and had the perfect blend of rice noodles and herbs. Love that they put cilantro and basil in theres. Peanut dipping sauce was creamy and not oversaturated with hoisin sauce like most places. Excellent!! We left not a single crumb behind.  Honestly, i was shocked that this place wasnt packed with people. The food is amazing! I think some  people are unaware of what banh mi is and too scared to go in and find out. Dont be!! This is an affordable and surefire bet and really expands your knowledge on vietnamese food, its not all pho pho pho! Get in here and eat, its one of my new go tos and i will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Banh mi? It's a Vietnamese take on French sandwiches, and let me tell you, they knock it out of the park. I like a banh mi as much as the next guy, but this restaurant, kills it. I've tried most of the items on the menu, nothing beats the BMB special (grilled pork with pâté with pickled daikon and carrots with TWO fries eggs!) and accompanied by either spring rolls or lotus root salad (large portions btw) and wash it all down with their famed cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee). Super friendly and helpful staff, you'll see what one taking about."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place is a must if you are ever in the mood for a hot noodle bowl filled with only the good stuff.   I ordered the pork belly buns. A peach ginger iced tea. And a shrimp/tofu noodle bowl.   The pork belly buns were fresh, warm, and full of great texture. That spicy mayo and hoisin sauce combo though, perfect.   The peach ginger iced tea, I could drink my weight in that and still want more. This alone is worth the drive.   Lastly, the grilled shrimp and tofu noodle bowl. The vermicelli noodles were cooked perfectly. The plethora of veggies, both marinated and not, were fresh and had that wonderful crispness to them. The grilled shrimp, was actually grilled with seasonings, savory, slightly sweet, wonderful.   I will definitely be back. And I sincerely recommend this place to everyone.   The service was genuine, and attentive. Again, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy! I'm so glad I was on this side of town at lunch time today .. the noodle salad bowl hit the spot!  Perfect for lunch .. the noodle salad bowl with pork and a pork egg roll ($8).. the salad element with the crunchy cucumber and Thai mint .. compliments the seasoned pork and noodles really well.. the pork egg roll served sliced on top of the bowl is a perfect addition.. with the noodle salad you get to pick two meat/egg roll options.. finish it with chili sauce..   We found this place originally looking for a vegetarian option and have been back several times.. it's tucked into a strip mall by a pawn shop and dry cleaners... don't let that stop you from checking this place out.. you will not be disappointed.. staff is friendly .. busy during the week at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick Vietnamese meal. Stopped by for lunch today and tried the Bun, noodle salad, with pork and an enroll. It was lovely to look at and tasted delicious. Staff was also very friendly. I'll have to return to try their banh mi. They also have rice plates along with milk tea and shaved snow. Definitely adding this to my list of favorite lunch spots in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best banh mi places in Arizona. I moved here from California and I couldn't find a place in Arizona that had good sandwiches until I came here!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Bistro is great. Phenomenal sandwiches, very good spring rolls...and reasonable prices. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! This place is in a great location from my work, so I always try to sneak away and grab some awesome food and milk tea! My favorite is the Thai milk tea with boba. It's not too sweet but it's an original flavor. The ingredients they use for their sandwiches are all fresh and delicious. The appearance of the restaurant is very clean and welcoming too."}
{"text":"Super good food at a very good prices.  The restaurant was super clean and the owner, who took our order, was the nicest guy you could ever meet.  Its one of our favorite new places!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm bmb special is so yummy and has a lot of flavors!  I want to try their other sandwiches so I will come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a total of five times. Every single time, I get the grilled pork noodle salad bowl with egg rolls aka bun thit nuong + cha gio. It's my absolute favorite! The bowl has the perfect portion of meat & noodles tossed with refreshing cucumbers/bean sprouts. Put in the fish sauce that's provided, and the sauce elevates the meal by 10 folds. On weekdays, I usually order togo. My boyfriend and I usually dine in on the weekends. Service is fast. I honestly think the cashier remembers our order every time we come in by now.   The milk tea is pretty good here. I tried the Thai milk tea, which was satisfactory. I would recommend getting the taro milk tea - it's delicious. I'm actually craving one right now!   Just a heads up that they are closed on Sundays! Oh, they also do not serve pho lol."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! All the sandwiches are super good (meat cooked perfectly, bread that doesn't cut the top of your mouth, and fresh veggies).  This is probably my favorite banh mi place in Arizona.  Everything is reasonably priced and for the portion you get.. very well worth it!  Every time I go I have leftovers, and let me tell you even the leftovers are delicious.  The owners are super friendly as well, I really want them to open up something closer to Tempe!  I have a pretty defined palette for banh mi as I grew up in Los Angeles where there was practically one on every corner.  I take back my earlier statement .. this is practically the best place I have EVER had.    What to get:  My favorite is #1 special with egg, however for a first timer, I would recommend the #2 the grilled pork with egg is cooked to perfection.    Eggrolls are a good appetizer   Try this place!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food on light, fluffy baguettes!  Amazing flavor, great service.  Leave room for shaved ice! This is what they serve in heaven..."}
{"text":"The BMB special is worth trying! Best banh mi special I've eaten in Arizona! Happy to have it open in the north Phoenix region."}
{"text":"Their noodle bowls are the BEST. I should try their other items on the menu but I always end up getting the noodle bowl."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. Food is incomparable and staff are friendly. Always come here when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best banh mi in the valley! Also their iced coffee and bao buns were delightful! I drive 45min each way just to eat here and it's worth it every time"}
{"text":"This place is great!! He needs to open a location is Scottsdale.  Very tasty. I like the noodle bowls the best. Fresh ingredients.  Small businesses need our support and you need to try something new."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place is anywhere comparable to the amazing Vietnamese Banh Mi places from California are. From price and flavor, Banh Mi Bistro is on the opposite end of what I believe Banh Mi should taste and be priced at. Portion wise, you get a lot of food ... but it's about quality not quantity.   This is actually my second visit to BMB, the first being a trek out here but it being closed an hour before posted Store Hours. Second time around, I ordered the number 7 the Bo Luc Lac Banh Mi as well as a Green Tea boba drink. I questioned the cashier on the popular smoothies and milk teas and when asking about the Green Tea if it was powdered, I was told it was Matcha.   The Banh Mi came out as a foot long Banh Mi wrapped in the traditional white paper and rubber band. The Banh Mi bread was okay, but nothing you would really find at the small mom and pop shops, streets of Vietnam or even Lee's sandwiches. The inside of the sandwich consisted of grilled onions, cilantro, pickled daikon and carrot, jalapeno, red cabbage, slices of cooked beef. When I think of Bo Luc Lac, I think of flavorful beef with flavors of bell peppers and grilled onions similar to those served along side of Fajitas and Tomato Rice. It's typically made with tender cubes of beef that's sauteed, after all that's how it's named after how the meat is cooked literally meaning Shaking Beef (you know, like in a pan). Though the meat was tender, I was surprised at how unflavorful it was. No hint of soy, black pepper, nothing. All I could taste was the cilantro, heat from the Jalapeno and tart bite from the pickled veg. Very underwhelming sandwich and all for $7! Ouch.  The green tea boba drink was very underwhelming as well, Matcha it is not and far from. This was definitely made with some kind of artificial Green Tea flavor. The boba was also overcooked and mushy.  Place is nice and clean, service is friendly and somewhat quick. Did not appreciate the smell coming from the mopping however during my time eating here. Smelled pretty rancid. Price too steep for sandwiches that normally cost $2 and lack flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pork belly Bao Buns make my toes tingle. Grilled onions on the potstickers, ohhh yeah baby. Crab puffs are filled with onions and crab, yumm. I've got a pate' and pork Banh Mi for Paul."}
{"text":"Top notch food! This restaurant is tucked away next to cash store, so I never gave it a chance until this week. Too bad because I've been missing out! Very nice interior and friendly staff. But most important is the food - wow! Unique and flavorful! I had a noodle bowl while my daughter tried one of the many sandwiches. They were amazing! Will. Be coming back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was spotless and the cashier was helpful in suggesting good food. My dad and I split two sandwiches which was way too much food considering we also ordered egg rolls and vegetarian spring rolls. The spring rolls were delicious and warm which I am not used to. My first bite into the shaken beef sandwich was not good... the meat was chewy and I am already skeptical of ribeye so I did not enjoy that. The BMB special, on the other hand was fantastic. Who knew pâté, pork, and an egg with a slightly raw yolk could taste so great on some bread?"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I would find such a good banh mi place in Arizona? If you are craving some banh mi, this is the place to go. I'm originally from San Jose, CA which is a huge Vietnamese area and I have to say that Banh Mi Bistro is on par in my opinion.  The sandwich itself is very large! I got the #2 BMB Special (grilled pork, fried egg, pate) super yummy, I'd recommend getting this one!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley!! I highly recommend the noodle salad bowl with grilled pork and pork egg roll. This is a great family owned business and the owner John is always super friendly and happy to see you when you come in. I've always have great experience every time I've eat here!!"}
{"text":"pretty good vegetarian spring rolls (there's a little taro in it, yum!) but a little pricey for $5 and the green papaya salad was pretty bomb as well, I didn't even use the fish sauce!"}
{"text":"I had the #8, potstickers and a iced coffee for lunch. A bit much but I was hungrey. The sandwhich was good with very fresh ingrediants. The potstickers were also yummy. I would like to try them on prem next time as they may have gotten a little soft in the commute back to work. I will be back and try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Really really delicious food here. I got the spring rolls and a shrimp salad and so so so so good!! They made it pretty quickly and you order at the counter. It is family owned. Yummy food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, kid friendly and excellent sandwiches. I could eat here everyday. I've always enjoyed banh mi sandwiches more than Pho, so it's nice to have a sandwich only shop with good appetizers and desserts."}
{"text":"This is the best Bahn Mi in the valley! Seriously! You have to try the BMB, by far my favorite bite of food. The combination of flavors and textures in that sandwich is amazing. The spring rolls are a go to app. Friendly, fast service, good portions and great pricing. You won't regret stopping here."}
{"text":"Great little gem just down the street - have a feeling we will be regulars.  The banh mi grilled pork sandwich was amazing.  The bread was slightly crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  The meat was delicious and tender and the veggies were fresh and made it.  We also tried the spring rolls and lotus salad - quite delightful!  The boba tea and smoothie was also really a treat.  Clean, friendly, fast, affordable - what more could you ask for?  Oh, maybe a kids size selection?..."}
{"text":"Awesome that I can now get Banh Mi so close to boring Norterra. No more trips to Mesa needed to get my fix. As usual, had #5 the bbq pork."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi I think I've ever had from here to Nor Cal/ So Cal and back! (And I've had a lot of banh mi's!) They also serve up some really good Boba.  I just wish the Boba cups were larger!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from North Carolina and I was looking for a Vietnamese restaurant that served Banh mi sandwiches. Oh my! This place was amazing. Their grilled chicken sandwich was tasty and delicious. Their Thai tea hit the spot. I would definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Fantastic place - the food was great, service was quick and the place is very clean!  We had the potstickers, noodle salad bowl, classic banh mi and the shaken beef, taro boba and coconut snow fluff - it was all fantastic - very fresh and delicious - can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"The highly rated reviews enticed my wife and I to try this place and we can't wait to come back.  Located in a strip mall near the I-17, Banh Mi is very casual and the staff is very helpful. It was apparent we were not familiar with this food yet they explained the menu and provided great recommendations.   We ordered the pork sandwich and a noodle dish to share. In hindsight, one sandwich would have enough in that the portion size are generous.  We also ordered the salmon roll appetizer, which filled us up too. That was really good although I thought it was light on the salmon.  The food was great and I cant wait to try the other selections. One thing I would not try again is the green tea w/milk drink. Maybe others enjoy it yet I thought it tasted like a cup of perfume.  My wife ordered a chai drink and that was really good.  All in all, great place to have close by and will come back with the kids next time."}
{"text":"Will be back! Food is spicy, flavorful and fast. We got the classic banh mi and the shaken beef. Loved the shaken beef and would order again. The flavor of the classic was not to my liking but sure lots of people would enjoy. They also have milk teas in different flavors so we had coconut milk tea which was a nice sweet touch to our spicy meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The owner is super friendly and helpful! I was a vegetarian and always got the tofu bahn mi and it is amazing! But today I tried the cheeseburger and it was delicious like a vietnamese version of a sloppy joe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Banh Mi places.  The BMB special is great!  I love that they add a fried egg (or rather 2) on it.  I called in an order.  They told me 20 minutes (which I thought was crazy), but it was ready in 10, thank goodness!  Their milk teas are also good.  I've had the coconut and taro."}
{"text":"Was going to get one item but the owner recommended another (#2 BMB) which was fantastic.    My wife got the noodle bowl with fries shrimp, which she only let me have one bite if.  As with most delicious hole-in-the-walls,I would never have gone in without good Yelp reviews.   Decor is typical modest small joint style with cheap tables, but you are there for food not atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. A bit dry, could use some more saucing. BIGGEST spring rolls (not deep fried) you've ever seen with good sized shrimp on them!"}
{"text":"Great banh mi at affordable prices! Super fast and friendly. Probably one the best banh mi places around the area."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and the food is just as outstanding as it was the first time! The grilled pork Banh Mi and the Bun Noodle salad were both outstanding. The sandwich was huge and filled with meat unlike most banh mi sandwiches. The meat was tender and juicy the bread was crisp and the pickle was done just right. The fresh-squeezed limeade was also a treat. If I didn't live on the other side of town I would definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I really like coming here. They may be known for their sandwiches (and the fact they serve no Pho) but it's the noodle bowls that I tend to gravitate to. They are gluten free as are the rice dishes. Comes with your choice of two meats, I always get double chicken. The service is prompt and efficient. The staff is always nice."}
{"text":"That's a bomb sandwich right there!!! Had the lemongrass, first time here but far superior to Lee Lee sandwiches and they take debit cards"}
{"text":"6/15/18 Lunch  The restaurant was clean and the line was moving very quickly. Customer service was good nothing to friendly but definitely not rude. The sandwich was good but nothing to wow you. Bread was fresh and veggies as well but the chicken that was teriyaki or soy didn't constitute the cost. I can't say anything about the salad because my guest didn't eat it. Her boba drink was terrible though, her words not mine."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast and friendly service, awesome place! The spring rolls are amazing as are the bahn mi, everything is really good actually lol."}
{"text":"I love love love BMB. Lunch or early dinner, dine or take out.  This family- run small business is closed Sundays and most holiday weekends.  The food never disappoints, and special requests are cheerfully accommodated.  My favorites are the grilled chicken rice plate, shaken beef and the noodle salad bowls.  At an $8 price point or below for entrees and bowls, they also offer the signature namesake sandwiches and other Vietnamese favorites, boba drinks and smoothies.  I have eaten here weekly all year and have been reluctant to write a review? for fear it will make them even busier!"}
{"text":"Going to get my complaint out of the way early: this place needs to open new locations. It's in North Phoenix, and unfortunately that isn't the most convenient place for me. Fortunately I had an errand near-ish to it, so I made it a point to go here.  The prices are very reasonable. At least for the consumer. The quality exceeded what I paid for it. I was a little worried it was going to be small, but it was pretty much a foot-long banh mi. The combination/ratio of all the ingredients was absolutely perfect, and the flavor was so good I wanted to get another. By another, I mean something like a 10-foot banh mi for an office party.   The bread was excellent, but I love Vietnamese bread. It's extra crisp on the outside, and airy-soft in the middle. The flavors are layered, so you get an explosive burst in your mouth, yet it all comes together harmoniously. I really wanted to try something from the shaved ice menu, but that will be for next time. I think I'm going to have to come up with an excuse to go to North Phoenix again. And soon."}
{"text":"#3 pork sandwich+spring rolls=very satisfied.  Fresh ingredients and great flavor abound.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place serves up some legit banh mi sandwiches! There aren't a while lot of banh mi options around me (Scottsdale) but fortunately I found this place on a search. It's definitely quite a drive still but the food is so good it makes the trip worthwhile.   The sandwich was pretty incredible. I didn't have high expectations for banh mi sandwiches since it's Phoenix we're in and not California but boy did this place blow me away! Every single piece of the sandwich was just pure quality. The bread doesn't look like the traditional bread typically used for banh mi sandwiches but it didn't matter because it was amazing. It looked like a French baguette but was light and fluffy unlike a French baguette. I had the BMB special which came with grill pork, fried eggs, pate, and the usual pickled veggie/cucumbers/cilantro/jalapeño combo. The pork was tender and well seasoned; the over easy eggs were perfectly cooked; the veggies added some nice crunch and freshness to the sandwich.   I really wish I had a stomach for two of these! The size of the sandwich was quite generous. I definitely didn't leave hungry; just left wondering when my next visit would be!"}
{"text":"I've had the lotus root salad and green papaya salad.  So good.  The fish sauce was flavorful, not watered down.  Please don't jeopardize taste for profit like other restaurants.  That would be a shame."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous !! can't recommend it highly enough. Bahn Mi Bistro is probably the best lunch value in town and boy are their sandwiches and potstickers delicious and so reasonably priced.   My friend and I tried the Bahn Mi Sandwich and the one with grilled chicken. They were huge and I doubted being able to finish mine but I did. The potstickers are homemade and I even went for seconds.  The place is impeccably clean, easy to find and the staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE BANHMI BISTRO!!! My favorite thing to get here BMB Special (Grilled, Fried Egg and Pate) And Shaved Ice! Life!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service food was amazing the environment is really laid back will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The bread is to die for! Crunch yet not dry...Sandwiches are a great value and this is the authentic Vietnamese eatery...Best spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce. Get the classic Banh mi special sanwhich...the fried egg takes this to a whole new and awesome level.  The food would be well worth it at twice the cost...so take advantage of this unique authentic and friendly Bistro...and enjoy eating your way through the menu. I will be back many times now that I found this gem."}
{"text":"After visiting the dry cleaners next door - Zest - I stopped in here for an iced Vietnamese coffee and a quick look at the menu.  When I saw \"Bistro\" in the name, I assumed I would find a bar and a Vietnamese oriented \"Bistro\"  menu similar to those I experienced living in San Francisco for many years.  A \"Bistro\", Banh Mi is not.  Banh Mi is an awesome storefront Vietnamese fast food joint - great prices, quality fresh food, quick service.  The place is sparse on atmosphere, paper plates and plastic ware if you desire to eat in; but a clear favorite of the Vietnamese community for take-out.  I've now made several repeat visits and can recommend the Spring Rolls which are two substantial rolls of pork, shrimp, rice noodles and vegetables wrapped in rice paper and served cold.  At $4 per order of two, this is the best price I have seen in Phoenix. Hint - skip the gummy side of peanut sauce, and make yourself a small cup of sriracha infused hoisin sauce at the little condiment counter.  Potstickers - also $4 for 4 - your choice of chicken or pork, are excellent, cooked to order with a minimalist portion of slightly spicy sauce.  The shrimp noodle salad bowl - with extra shrimp - $10 - is enough for a lunch, and plenty to take home for a light evening meal.   I have not had the sandwiches, however, they appear to be a popular choice for takeout.  The Vietnamese iced coffee will cause you to be a regular for that alone.  I will continue to enjoy Banh Mi (not Bistro) on these hot summer days."}
{"text":"I was disappointed upon our first visit, however we gave it another shot, then another, and another .... And it's amazing. I'm updating my review to 5 stars because they've earned it. Shaken beef sandwich, Awesome. You must try the snow! It's an unbelievable dessert. It's like a snow cone consistency but powdery as well, topped with fruit of your choice, (along with many other options) then they pour sweet and condensed milk over the top and that's when the magic happens. It's large, we split it between us and still feel completely satisfied. OUT OF THIS WORLD. I crave it every single day due to the 115 temps we are dealing with."}
{"text":"Vietnamese sandwich on a new level! BMB special is my favorite. They need to open early so I can stop in to buy ice coffee every morning before work."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times before but I'm not sure why I never wrote a review for this place.  It is right up the street from work, and they make a mean Banh Mi Sandwich!  I decided to go with a #3 (Grilled lemongrass pork) with no mayo.  The pork is nice and tender, and just sweet enough from the marinade.  They stuff this in a huge (at least 12 inch) baguette. About that...the bread they use is great!  Crispy/crunchy on the outside, and pillowy soft on the inside.  It is a perfect banh mi bread!  It comes with your normal banh mi veggies like radish, carrot, jalapeno and cilantro.  The radish is my favorite veggie on here.  Crunchy, yet easy to bite through.  Great textures throughout this sandwich!  Best part?  Only about $6.00 and the sandwiches are GIANT...could easily be split with someone else.  I want to come back to try out their bowls which look awesome!  I don't crave a banh mi sandwich that often, but whenever I do, this is the spot in Phoenix to go to.  Reminds me of K Sandwiches in San Diego...and that is a good thing!  I'll be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Small unassuming place,but one taste is all you'll need, very good spring rolls in rice paper, bahn mi sands of lemongrass pork and shaken beef ribeye are large and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I was Soooooooooo sad.  My hotel was down the street and they close at 5 pm on a Saturday?!????       How does a restaurant close at 5 on a Saturday?!???   Gosh I wish I could have tried the food."}
{"text":"Very clean and organized place. Food is served fast and the teas here are very good."}
{"text":"The vietnamese sandwiches are good tasting but they over charge too much. Comparing it to a lees sandwich, they give same amount but charge double the price. The drinks do not taste that great either.."}
{"text":"I just wanna say the owner of this restaurant  is one of the best I delt with and there workers the guys were closed and they still opened the doors for me to get shaved snow I will for sure be back to this restaurant thank u guys"}
{"text":"Whaaat???  I am always amazed at how delicious their Chicken Pork Salad Noodle Bowl tastes.  The bowl is overflowing with meat, crunchy veggies and rice noodles.  I crunch and slurp to my heart's content.  My hubby, not a sandwich lover-adores the Pork Bahn Mi.  He is addicted to the bread-and loves the perfectly seasoned pork.  The owner is a delight and very welcoming.  Wish it was right around the corner-might be my daily meal!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife and kids in for a meal this time. I tried the pork and shrimp noodle salad. Great flavor and perfect quantity. We also had a the grilled chicken sandwich. It was flavorful. Lastly we had the potstickers. Man are they big and delicious. Without a question one of our favorites. On the drink side we had the to order boba teas. Can't come here without having one of them. My personal favorite is the regular milk boba tea. This time we went with a Coconut milk tea and the Taro tea. Good in their own right but will continue ordering the regular milk tea with boba in the future. Owner is very friendly and will help you out with any questions you may have. #vietnameseeatery #bobatea #smallbusiness"}
{"text":"First time at Banh Mi Bistro. Saw the reviews and menu...it was a no brainer. Had the Shaken Beef Sandwich and was not disappointed. Baguette was fresh with all kinds of veggies and tender steak pieces with a little heat. Just $7.  The freshness, colors and textures were quite different and tastey. Large sandwich with enough for a second meal. Service was exceptional. This Vietnamese eatery has plenty of signs that say no Pho....they have many selections of specialty sandwiches, salads and noodle dishes. This one is bookmarked....and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner contacted me after my last review saying I should come back. Why would I give a business my money when they wasted my time by closing early? Time is the most precious commodity that any person has. Previous to attempting to eat at this restaurant, I had read all their reviews and knew that the person contacting me, posing as a manager, was actually the owner. Kind of strange to be dishonest about that. Furthermore, I noticed that this same person had posed as a customer, leaving Bahn Mi two separate 5 star reviews. That is really dishonest and shady. So at this point, the ownership and business of Bahn Mi have completely lost credibility with me. I don't support companies like that, yo.   By the way, Yelp removed those two reviews the owner left for Bahn Mi after I reported them because obviously that goes against their policies."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bahn mi sandwiches are awesome and better than a $5 foot long that you would get somewhere else. All the food tastes really fresh and don't forget to the iced Vietnamese coffee, my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"THE HOLY AND KING OF ALL BANH MI SANDWICHES! I won't lie, I was a little skeptical at first because it didn't look like the normal \"hole in the wall\" Vietnamese sandwich places I'm used to. The prices are a little pricer than the other Vietnamese sandwich shops BUT it's all worth it! I've tried every sandwich on the menu and THERE IS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT! Take my money- ALL OF IT, you good sandwich you!!! It's so good .... Can I marry one of these sandwiches please? #IDo #BeMine"}
{"text":"When I first seen this place, I thought oh cool now I'll have a pho place near my work. So when I first came in I was surprised that they didn't have pho. So I ordered the fresh spring rolls and bun noodle salad and I was impressed. The amount of food for the price is crazy ! The salad is huge! Then I tried the banh mi sandwich .. With egg AND jalapeños AND THE BREAD !! Fireworks!!! It's kinda amazing!!  I love this place and I'm a regular here"}
{"text":"Finally! Good banh mi available all day long! The sandwiches and sides that we've tried so far have all been super good and we'll priced. The paté is made in house and is wonderful. For sure worth your time."}
{"text":"Consistent; fresh; clean, smiling / engaging employees. Such a nice change of pace from the corporate feed-lots. All our family/friends go here now :-D"}
{"text":"OMG how is it even possible I work 5 minutes away, crave Bahn Mi DAILY, and only today found out about this amazing spot?  Had the #2 BanhMi with fried Egg which I loved and tried the #7 which was great, but I like the yummy Pate' a little more.    Also tried the Spring Roll which was great and the Salmon Spicy roll which was pretty good.  But just save room for lots of amazing Banh Mi.   I will be back a lot..  It gets busy so go early."}
{"text":"I went here originally for pho Yelp said they serve it despite multiple signs telling you they don't  I ended up getting pot stickers and Thai boba tea. The pot stickers are a perfect combination of crispy and tender, however you only get 4 for $4 so it's a dollar a pop and they aren't too big so won't be getting full off of those. Another gripe I had was that their soy sauce is a bit too salty like salt is the only spice used. I would appreciate more flavor in the sauce. The Thai tea was pretty decent as well! Overall the experience was pretty good even though I didn't get what I came for. Hopefully I can come back and get a sandwich so I can have a more in-depth review."}
{"text":"LOVE the pork Banh Mi sandwich, chicken noodle soup and the Strawberry smoothie (w/coconut milk) All Delicious! I come here often for the pork & shrimp spring rolls too. Everything is so fresh and the service is always very good."}
{"text":"No noodle soups here! They offer Vietnamese sandwiches, salads, and rice plates. All super fresh and delicious. My favorite is combo sandwich and shaken beef rice plate with fried egg. Yummy! They also have the best boba drinks; perfect sweetness (not too sweet) and soft yet chewy boba. I go here whenever I'm nearby even if it's not meal time; I get couple of sandwiches to go to keep in my fridge for when I get hungry. They'll pack the veggies on the side so it doesn't get soggy."}
{"text":"Banh mi?  More like yum mi!  My pal has been checking in here a lot and on one Monday morning, he decided to rudely wake me up early by texting me.  Did I want to go to the mall with him so he can change the battery on his iPhone?  Heck no.  Did I want lunch with him?  Heck yes!  Oh my goodness.  Can somebody pick my panties off the floor?  Everything we ate was bomb.  That Grilled Pork Banh Mi ($6) and the Cheeseburger [YES. CHEESEBURGER.] Banh Mi ($7) was fire!  We also got the Pork Belly Bao Buns ($4) and Firecracker Salmon Rolls ($4) and they were also delicious.  The Grilled Pork was juicy and tender with a hint of lemongrass.  The Cheeseburger was what you'd expect although a bit on the greasier side.  I liked it but I probably wouldn't get it again.  The Pork Belly Bao Buns were tender and flavorful. They're not too big and is a good side dish.  I also love the pickled vegetables as it cut through the richness of the pork belly.  As for the Firecracker Salmon Rolls, these were like the Cheesecake Factory's version but without the spinach.  We also got a Peach Ginger Iced Tea and a Passionfruit Iced Tea to wash down our food.  I found the peach ginger tea to be too syrupy and didn't even finish it.  I would pass on drinks.  So yes, I hate Wilson for showing me a dang good banh mi place and having that place be sooo far away!  It's some delicious food, y'all.  The portions are also HUGE!  I ate half for lunch and the other half for dinner.  Gotta love good portions and good food for such little dinero.  Stop in if you're in the area and grab a doughnut next door at LaMar's.  *kisses fingertips*"}
{"text":"Yum mi! Ever since visiting Vietnam I've been on the lookout for a good banh mi restaurant and luckily found one! The sandwiches at this place were huge and a really good deal for $6-$7. My boyfriend and I split a Grilled Pork and a Shaken Beef sandwich. They were both tasty with fresh ingredients but we liked the beef more because it was juicier and the meat was nice and tender. We each also ate a spring role (2 for $4) that contained a generous amount of ingredients inside and came with a nice peanut sauce. A sandwich and a spring roll was beyond filling but very satisfying, I'll definitely want to try some of the other combos on their menu!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best Vietnamese sandwich I've had since I moved here from cali. I tried lees in Tempe and from different restaurants and this sandwich seriously beat the rest. I ordered a grilled BBQ pork sandwich and the taste was on point, the bread was fresh, and it was made fresh, right in front of me. The foot long sandwich  was $5 so it was a bit pricier than lees and in California. But hey I can't compare to cheap California prices. The service was friendly and the place was super clean with separate bathrooms for guys and girls. The Thai tea was decent. I wish it was more concentrated. But other than that , this is best banh mi in Phoenix ! Unfortunately, I ordered green papaya salad and when I got home found nothing but shrimps and daikon inside. I've had a lot of Vietnamese appetizer salads and this was blatantly wrong. Please fix that. I don't like to be excited about eating green papaya salad and ended up with daikon salad which by the way.. Was not good."}
{"text":"Very generous portions, great flavor, and great service. I ordered the noodle salad bowl- there was a lot of protein - you choose two. They have non meat options as well: tofu and veggies.  They give you extra sauce if you want more. Very evident that they care about their customers.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mi on the planet. We drive 30 miles regularly to eat this amazing food. Order the #3 with egg and the iced coffee. Sumptuous."}
{"text":"OMG this was sooooo good! Had the grilled chicken Banh Mi and will definitely be back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered and shared the Spring Rolls, #2 BBQ Special and #7 Shaken Beef Sandwiches.  Small place but great food for the cost. Love the sandwiches. The meat was pretty good amount and the bread was pretty good.  Comparing to Lee's Sandwiches,  Lee's Baugette Bread is better, but the amount of meat is more generous at Banh Mi.  I look forward to coming back to try other items and not have to drive to Chandler for good Banh Mi Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the classic pulled pork bahn mi. Generous sized sub-style sandwich with tender and juicy pork and crisp veggies for a great price - $6. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Bahn Mi a few months ago, and my first visit here had me hooked! Everything is freshly made to order, the staff is so friendly and they have the best Taro bubble tea. The egg roll with rice paper is fantastic and the portions are so generous!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small, in a strip center, in a questionable area, but the banh mi's were very good. I ordered the #2 with pork, an egg, and pate. The egg was a bit more cooked than I would have liked but the sandwich was pretty good and very affordable. I didn't, however, like the smell of the restaurant and the lotus salad was just ok for me. I didn't love the taste of fish sauce in the salad but some people may like that. The guy who took our order was very nice. 4 stars because I'd go back but I still think da vang has better banh mi's."}
