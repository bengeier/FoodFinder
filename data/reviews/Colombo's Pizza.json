{"text":"Really good food - standouts are veal sandwiches, Neopolitan pizza with homemade sausage, panzerotto. Great neighbourhood atmosphere, I always like going here."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing....so much more than just Pizza. I tried their famous Italian Rice Ball & Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. Both exceeded my expectations. The staff was friendly and down to earth. They didn't even mind when my 3yr old son spilled an entire can of ginger ale on the floor! lol. The Proprietor even came out to the dining room after we finished eating to play with my son! I will be returning here to eat as often as possible :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is just ok, nice fresh toppings, but I have to agree with other comments.  Better than the chains But.....The crust is a Giant Fail!!!  It ruins the whole experience and doesn't hold a candle to Danforth Pizza!"}
{"text":"ok don't have the veal sandwich, went back last nite after kids got out of school for a couple of slices (THEY ARE GOOD).. the veal is frozen deep fried then put on a bun that is heated in the pizza oven with cheese and jalepeno peppers...sorry this is not italian veal sand...off to california again.

note: the two stars is for veal sand. only"}
{"text":"Last week, I had the eggplant sandwich with mushrooms, peppers, onions, cheese, tomato sauce and a few hot peppers.  Seems impossible, but it was bland.  I will definitely give this place a second chance, though, because the pizza looked good.

The woman who served me was very helpful and friendly.  They were speaking Italian in the kitchen, so that's gotta be good! ;-)"}
{"text":"the only thing I love more than their pizza is their rice balls! They are so worth the drive from the west."}
{"text":"I have only had pizza here and have ordered it with the past owners and the new owners that came in roughly one year ago.
The staff are very friendly the place has a feel of Little Italy when you walk in but that is where it ends for me.  The slices are heavy on the dough and kinda' soggy.  The sauce and cheese add nothing for taste and I am really dissappointed by this pizza."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day, and both home with colds.  Decide to order delivery pizza, but don't want any of the standard chains.  To our disappointment, we find out our house is in a Pizzaiolo delivery dead zone, and Danforth Pizza didn't deliver.  So we rifled through the stack of take out menus we get in our mailbox. Colombos seems like the best available option.

Guy on phone was friendly and it arrived within 20 minutes. Pizza was fresh and tasty enough. Not as good as Danforth or Pizzaiolo, but better than the major chains.   The crust was a little uneven, literally. Sauce was subtle.  Honey garlic wings were big and tasty. 

I'd order again in a pinch, but not my first choice. If I'm not out with a cold, I'd probably drive and pick-up next time."}
