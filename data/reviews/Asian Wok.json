{"text":"I have been visiting different Asian restaurant establishments around the area, but this place has great Asian cuisine. A hole in the wall type of place. From Chinese, to Vietnamese, etc... Great service, fast delivery time, and great atmosphere. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Only go here if you like gummy meat. It was, perhaps, the most disgusting meat I have ever had. Blech."}
{"text":"We ordered three different chicken dishes and they were all delicious.  The Pad Thai was excellent.  Great food and great service.  I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Used Yelp to suggest a restaurant close to my home.

What a find !!!

This was my first visit but, certainly not my last.

Very clean !
Quiet !
Excellent service !
     .....and most of all.....
Great food !!!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices and a great family atmosphere, happy that we a great Chinese joint on this side of town"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. I ordered chicken pad thai, and yellow curry. The curry was fine, but the pad thai was completely cold and very greasy. Also, while they gave us rice the box was only half-full. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I would have to say the food really does have a good flavor. It's not your typical fast food Chinese Resturant you find on commercial corners around the valley. I came from the Bay Area where there are plenty of different Chinese Resturants.  Thank you for giving the northwest of Las Vegas a chance to help you be successful ....."}
{"text":"This is my go to to get my Chinese fix. Always delivery and I'm overall happy with the service and speed. They have all the usual menu items but my favorites are panang curry, veggies only, and Thai iced tea. So good."}
{"text":"Good food good service. Food is reminiscent of the Chinese food found in NYC.  Traditional favorites excellent sauces and flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome service, friendly restaurant and tasty foods! The food quantities is awesome and Zoey is the best and most friendliest employee there! Keep up the amazing work!!! Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"loved it, lunch was the best today, and I didnt feel guilty at all eating my fill. because most items are pretty healthy"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant at the moment. Great food, nice staff and fast delivery!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first meal from Asian Wok. Everything was great. Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Its good and clean and brand new everything. Its the Americanized chinese food your expecting. As with any respectable chinese restaurant you get a pretty good lunch special. If you get there at dinner time, but on a lunch budget go with their teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It's good pricing, super quick with delivery, and their food is good. I hate take out that is too greasy or too plain, and this place has great taste and isn't oily. Plus the guy who works here is so nice. Every time we come in or have the food delivered he is so pleasant and friendly. It's great :)"}
{"text":"I decided to get this place again for lunch today. The lunch menu is definitely a great value and good portions. 

I got a large chicken and corn soup since I wasn't feeling well and it was $5.95 for a giant portion that will be great for leftovers. 

I also got the orange chicken which came with rice, a couple pieces of broccoli, and two crab rangoons. The amount of food is enough for two meals for me and with the soup it could turn into three! It was about $13.00 when tax was all said and done.

The food was ready quickly as I ordered it through the yelp app. It was very hot and fresh. My only complaint is my orange chicken wasn't spicy even though I ordered it that way. I had sriracha at home so it wasn't a big deal, but some more spice would be awesome.

All in all, this is a great place and they deliver too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I moved here to Vegas from Florida but originally from New York. The food was just ok. Service was the best part. I have eaten Chinese food my whole life and have yet to find anything close to NY style and taste. I am trying to find something here that is at least close. I ordered the sesame chicken combo with fried rice. The chicken was mostly breading with only dark meat chicken, some pieces better than the others and the sause was a little heavy with ok taste. The fried rice was good, not great but I liked it. The chicken corn soup was more like eggdrop soup with a few pieces of corn. The spring roll was eh at best along with the grab Rangoon. The place did seem very clean. The prices were about average. I might go back and try something else but would rather continue my search to find better. All in all it was not the worst but far from the best"}
{"text":"Decided on a return visit to Asian Wok last night. Being from New York, I remember Cantonese food like we had in Chinatown when Ike was president. Had delicious WonTon Soup, outstanding crispy Pork Roll, not the boring flavorless spring roll that everyone serves. Real chinese mustard is offered and so are crispy noodles.What a treat.. I tried the Pork Egg Foo Young. Portion was huge. Brought half home. More important is it's the best  I've ever tasted anywhere. We also had some Chow Fun which is on par with anyones. My wife, alot pickier than I am gives it five stars.This is a great place. Small, clean with very friendly service.Don't miss this one....you will love the food."}
{"text":"If you're really craving Thai food. Don't order from here. It was edible but not Thai."}
{"text":"The food was very hot when delivered although the egg rolls were soggy as the steam got to them. The egg flower soup was so so, I have definitely had better. The rest of the food was very good though. Better than other places in the area. We will definitely be having them again!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this brand new Asian cuisine.  We happened to be the very first customers at their grand opening.  It was absolutely the most delicious dine in/take out I've had in Las Vegas yet.  I had the Mongolian beef lunch and my lady had the Kung Pao chicken.  We both agree they were delicious and you can't beat the prices...  Lunch specials included soup that was just the right amount of spicy and I you can choose an egg roll or crab Rangoon which was super tasty.  Please give this clean little restaurant a chance and this will be our go to for Chinese."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Asian restaurant in the northwest part of town. I finally found a good one Asian Wok Chinese Thai cuisine. I had a awesome thai ice tea,  vegetable egg rolls and a shrimp Pad Thai. The food was very fresh and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant was immaculate and so were the restrooms. I will return to this restaurant and look forward to trying another dish."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst places I have ordered from. Ordered the Buddhas delight with tofu and received the most distasteful Chinese food. Tofu was under cooked and bland. Vegetables had an odd film (can't tell if it's grease or something else) on it. Chow mein was cold, portions small for the price."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this new place. We had family come into town so we decided to dine-in for dinner. Between us we had: Kung Pow Chicken, shrimp and broccoli, chicken lo mein, sweet and sour pork and general tso's chicken. Everyone (my 6 year old included) were clean plate-ers! The service was great-super friendly and the food was wonderful. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery.  Fried rice is actually fried rice and so tasty.  Everything was great and portions were awesome and priced better than everything around. Best Chinese take out around!"}
{"text":"Love this little place!!!  Often Thai/Chinese does one or the other OK but never both.  Then we found this NW gem.  Just south of Metro Pizza, every entree tried has been great.  Spouse is Thai, dislikes Thai American style food and enjoys the whole menu hear.  On the Chinese side, the salt and pepper entries (either pork or shrimp) are absolutely to die for.  OMG good!"}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry shrimp which is excellent. The vegetables in the egg foo young are cut too big but the gravy is very flavorful."}
{"text":"Asian Wok is our FAVORITE fast food Chinese place! We are foodies and we are no strangers to Authentic asian food. This place has delicious food, fast delivery but Yeah... the customer service is authentically chinese as well. Which means, don't expect a friendly, charming cashier or chef to greet you and shoot the breeze. You can simply expect the food that you order in a prompt fashion and it to be hot, fresh & delicious! The portion sizes are fantastic for the price! 

My husband specifically appreciates this spot for their food that is actually spicy, instead of the usual barely hot meals that are typically served to please the palate of the typical American customer. His regular order is the Singapore Mei fun. Its a curry style meifun, with shrimp, chicken and pork as well as vegetables. We highly recommend this place for carry out or delivery. However, If you're hoping to find an Authentic DINE IN Chinese restaurant where the customer service matches the food quality, I recommend you stop in at Wan Fu down the street."}
{"text":"A great little place with a wonderful menu! I have been here several times (during lunch hours ) and had great service.  My son gets the Kung Pao chicken and won't order anything else!
I have had the Panang Curry which is creamy and flavorful and so good I ate until I was in pain. I crave their Tom Yum soup and get it for take out every couple of weeks.  
Bonus * Boba tea * Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Why do some Chinese restaurants have a standard taste to the food, like they bought pre-mixed sauces from some factory that produces pre-mixed sauces? I believe this restaurant caters to American taste buds. My husband and I travelled around the world to most parts of Asia and China, this is definitely not the place to go for us.

We ordered Sze Chuan spicy shrimp

The waitress is super nice, I will give this place another try if I am super hungry and too lazy to cook next time."}
{"text":"Took large groups there few times and go there with just couple friends all the time; that means they are able to accommodate large group, parties, catering.  And regardless the group size, the food and service are always great.  The consistency is amazing!  They use drinking filtered water instead tap water for their beverages, less msg, meat portion and entree potion are bigger than other competitors."}
{"text":"Seems they may have different cooks, first visit during the week was much better than the weekend. Orders to go!  Roast Duck OK, Wor Wonton Soup OK, Scallops (Bay) in black bean sauce was pretty bad... Employee's are very nice... The fortune cookies are tasty II..... Their liquor license is still pending because of our slow government... I approve this message J K KUHL...."}
{"text":"We frequent Asian Wok regularly, and decided to have our food delivered. Our portions appeared extremely smaller than usual, so we are disappointed today!"}
{"text":"They just opened Feb 9, 2015. Please go and try it out!!! You won't be disappointed!! Delicious!!! Try Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles!!"}
{"text":"Despite the relatively poor reviews, my husband and I decided to try this restaurant because we wanted Thai food. The restaurant was clean and our server was nice, but it was, overall, not a place I'd return. I think the lower stars are just about right.

Upon entry, we saw a sign listing the \"Daily Specials.\" It was adorned with a Christmas theme... it's almost April.

The food was okay. We had the Tom Kah soup. It tasted good, but seemed to lack the coconut cream common in other renditions we'd tried. The main problem, though, was that the ladle that came with soup barely fit into the serving bowl. The bowl was pretty with its lit fire, but just not very user-friendly.

I ordered the Pad Thai. Their entries are huge and are good for 2-3 meals, but the dish lacked flavor. I couldn't taste peanuts or cilantro. Peanuts were served on the side in a densely-packed (hard to sprinkle) take-home container. I question if there were any peanuts or peanut butter in the dish besides the hard-packed side container."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered the pad Thai & it was awful! Very greasy and unpleasant to even taste. Inly 2 pieces of chicken and hardly any sprouts. I ordered through grubhub. Service was very fast and on time BuT the pad Thai was terrible. 
I ONLY RECOMMEND the sweet & sour chicken. All white mean and red  sauce on the side."}
{"text":"The staff is EXTREMELY friendly- it made the experience so enjoyable. Every customer leaving seemed to be very happy with the service & food- all saying they were gonna be back. It's very clean and the food was delicious. Good portions and flavors. I can see why they already have so much business only four days after opening."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I come here all the time.! Their employees are awesome, they get you served quickly and their delivery is fast and food is always hot and fresh.!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate here, excited about hopefully finally getting GOOD Chinese food here in the NW.. and then we got our reality check. 

Service was good, ingredients were fresh, place seemed clean.. so they get one star.  The taste of the food, however, was forgettable.

Hubby summed it up. \"You could take even the spicy dishes and blend it up for baby food\"

There was no flavor, just a vague sauce covering what would otherwise be good ingredients, rendering them into nothingness.

Three dishes, all fully snooze-worthy. Even their potstickers were boring. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good take out place for the nights you dont feel like cooking. Food is always fresh and delivered very quickly even though I dont live too close to the place. I love their hot & sour soup and the egg rolls. They did mess up our order once and delivered something totally different, but non the less it was still good."}
{"text":"decent. food tasted pretty bland last time i ordered, even after asking for it to be spicy. but for delivery asian food this is as good as any in the area"}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from here, both times delivery and we have zero complaints! The food is great, and they delivered 20 minutes after we ordered when they said it would be 45. Definitely exceeded our expectations and we will continue to order from here whenever we want Chinese food."}
{"text":"Love their chicken pad thai! Always get pickup - hot and always ready on time."}
{"text":"This was convenient for delivery purpose but that was about it.  

I did not enjoy the taste and found almost everything tasting the same. 

We ordered, eggrolls, beef chow fun, beef broccoli, chicken chow mein, and fried rice.   The chow mein was the most disappointing, with the most eatable being the fried rice and beef broccoli. 

Definitely not good enough to order again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Staff seemed a little overwhelmed because they were busy. Finally have a great Chinese restaurant close to the house."}
{"text":"First visit and ordered take out for me and the family. We ordered a lot...shrimp egg foo you, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, spicy basil chicken, chicken chow mein and shrimp fried rice. To my surprise everything was awesome. The only slightly disappointment was the orange chicken. I rather it be more orange zesty and spiced up with red chili pepper and less hot sauce (vinegar) spicey. It wasn't really crispy but assuming that's because I carried it home. Everything else was very flavorful and not over bearing. I hope this is not beginners luck with the other comments posted. The restaurant was clean and the host and Tony both demonstrated excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great lunch and dinner specials. I've been to a bunch of Asian restaurants around town and this place is the best by far. The staff is very friendly. Gotta try it for yourself you'll love it"}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked this place! He got the sweet and sour chicken and I got the general tso chicken. The chicken was crispy and the crab ragoons were yummy! We enjoyed the food for the price and the service was great. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!! Got delivery. It arrived 20 minutes earlier than the estimated time. Food was super hot and really, really good. So happy to give them a 2nd chance. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant after my daughter spotted their banner by the road. Been back 3 times in 2 weeks. The shrimp egg foo young is very good. Their Hong Kong style noodles are very good as well. When we crave Chinese, this will be our spot. Have only dined in and the food comes out very fast."}
{"text":"My wife was craving their Won Ton soup so we had to stop at the Asian Wok again. While she had \"The Best Soup\" I had the boneless wings and they were tops and an abundant. So much I actually took some home to finish them. The staff is also great and we had Zoe for our waitress and she always is pleasant and smiling too. Great Spot."}
{"text":"Had to bump it down to 1 star. Wish it could be negative stars. I can't with this place, I just can't anymore. It's never 100%.  Reluctantly ordered here again because husband likes their boneless ribs. I ordered the hot sour soup and the Thai salad. You can't mess up soup and salad, can you...? When the food arrived it was late by 30 mins after the estimated 45 mins (we live really close too). I found myself silently praying as I unpacked the items. Please, please, please be good. It's been a long day and I haven't been to the store yet, too tired to cook. Please! 
Husband's order was missing the rice and my soup was meh. HOWEVER, the salad...Omg, it smelled really weird, I kept sniffing it trying to figure out if it was the smell of chili flakes or onions, it smelled like....crayons(???) Even my husband said it smelled like putty. Pee-yew!  Stuck my fork in and took a bite of cucumber...Bleugh! Dressing was SO bad, like a really greasy mouth feel and tasted like melted crayons or what I think motor oil would taste like..then I realized after the second bite..THEY USED RANCID OIL! I'm so over this place, even if I did complain right then and there over the phone..I don't want their food anymore, I don't want a free nothing from here. UGHH! Buh bye Asian Wok"}
{"text":"Moved into the neighborhood about a year ago and we love this place. It's definitely on our rotation at least once a month. The owner couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. We get the beef chow fun which is awesome and mix up the chicken dishes because they are all pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out. Food arrived hot and tasted good. Surprised how good and hot the food was. Ordered egg foo yung, HK noodles, combination fried rice and the Pu Pu platter. Would order everything again except the Pu Pu platter which was good but loses something in the translation. A good choice for Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch special and then ordered dinner take out. So far the service has been good and the food was delicious.   No complaints."}
{"text":"Basic, no frills place, but that's why I like it. I always call ahead and pickup. Very quick, and the food is always fresh. The food has always been good and the portions are great. I usually order the Hunan Beef, my wife likes the honey chicken. I wouldn't dine-in here, and I've never had them deliver. The service reflects the building itself, very basic. For drop in and go, awesome. Date night? Not really, unless you're bringing the food home ;)"}
{"text":"I give this spot 5 stars for the area. Best chinese food for my taste in the north west. I have ordered aboit 15 times in the past year and the food is always fresh. The main items that i order consistently always are peferct. I have tried a few dish like pad thai that i didnt think wete very good. 
You should try this place."}
{"text":"One of the better ones in North Las Vegas. But that doesn't say much for the restaurant though. 

My wife and I came for dinner and had:

Hot and Sour Soup - a run of the mill pre-cooked soup. Not enough ingredients in the soup. Taste is somewhat bland. 

Shrimp Lo Mein -  shrimps were large and the dish was well cooked. As usual, in many Chinese restaurants, shrimps have a bit of \"kerosene\" taste, which in itself is not terribly unusual as frozen shrimps have that taste often and the kitchen staff has to process it careful to rid of this taste.

Mu Shu Pork - excellent taste but the ingredients need to be adjusted. In general, mushroom should not be used as the dish will become watery. An egg should be stir fried into the dish to absorb some of the moisture. 4 large flour pancakes, probably flour tortillas,  accompanied this dish. These are quite large and thick - probably the pancakes are procured. It is not quite fitting to use tortillas for this dish.

All in all, it is a passable meal. Pricing is good. But then in this Valley, this is already one of the better ones."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to eat at. If you want good Chinese food, quality and good portions size this is the place to go. The staff is always friendly and always accommodating."}
{"text":"Staffs were friendly but did not enjoy the food at all. Worst tom yum soup I've ever had greasy, lack of flavor and old mushroom they put it in smell so bad. They have decent lunch menu tho. I wont go back for the thai food for sure. They dont know how to cook thai food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have done takeout instead of delivery with no problem. Very good food and service."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place for the first time after reading the reviews. I tried calling to place an order... the phone number provided wouldnt go through. The website provided kept popping up \"not found\".... however i was able to place my order through an app. Which i did. It gave me a 40 mins est. Delivery time. Fairly standard. 50mins of waiting and nothing. So i tried calling again. This time  the number worked. I asked the girl who answered if my order was received and all she said was yes it was...in an impatient tone. Instead of getting into it with her i thanked her and ended the call. Another 50 mins passed and my order finally comes. Nearly two hours after placing it!!! I still tipped the driver 5$. I know its not completely his fault. However now i wished i hadnt!!! My food was cold! All of it! No flavor whatsoever. My daughter's (who was crying cause she was hungry and was getting impatient) fried shrimp was so chewy she wouldnt eat it. Very unsatisfied. Overall experience with this restaurant was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for good Chinese food in vegas forever and have been unsuccessful until now.   This place has great food and great service!  We had potstickers, combination fried rice,  Mongolian beef, and moo shu pork.  We were told the chef has 20+ years experience and it shows.   Prices are also reasonable.  Our meal came to $38.  You have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Okay it's good; it's really good Chinese food especially out here in the far northwest sticks where most of the restaurants are pure crap.  I just haven't had anything bad here; they Mongolian beef is freaking awesome! Is yummy beef is tender and I love onion and peppers.  The only reason why they are not getting 5 stars from me is they left a few things out of my take out order like the crispy noodles or soy sauce; nothing huge and I just went back and got it but if there can get the small stuff down I will give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best soups in LV filled with wontons and meat Above average entrees without the fillers most places put in, again emphasis on meat or seafood. Very friendly staff and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here before and had no problems
 I submitted an order online, received a confirmation order in my email and waited 50 minutes when I called the store they said they got an order and would have to start all over. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I love the service, the swiftness of my deliveries (never been inside), and never had a bad dish. Took off a star only because I have not been to the actual restaurant"}
{"text":"We have been getting takeout from Asian Wok since they opened and have never been disappointed. Today we ordered through Grubhub and not only was the food on time, they were early! Food was piping hot and delicious. It is definitely our favorite for Chinese food in the NW area."}
{"text":"Went here with my granny and kids, we received great service! Food was 10/10! Atmosphere was 10/10! My kids enjoyed everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm doing this review just for the service... I haven't even tried the food yet and will change it soon as I do... Did online order for delivery, and put on the comments not to ring the doorbell because I have a baby sleeping, dude rang it anyway.... He was apologetic and I'm just like whatever and signed the receipt... Opened up my order and see the soup I ordered have spilled... Not a lot but enough to piss me off and write this review within minutes of receiving my food"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese food and it's great that they have Thai food too! My husband always gets the chicken and broccoli, my son loves the combo chow fun and I like the Tom yum goon,"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food, ton of vegetables not much meat. The meat dishes are pretty pricey for the amount of meat you get. The chicken fried rice was good but the chicken looked a little weird, real white in color. The cow mein noodles looked like thick spaghetti. The General Tso's chicken was the best thing I ordered. The sauce was delicious mixed with white rice. Overall, I do not see myself returning."}
{"text":"It was lightning fast delivery- Kung pao shrimp requested spicy - not at all - pork roll tasted weird won't order that again - food was ok"}
{"text":"Small little Asian restaurant located on Park road in Pineville . Mostly take out orders.  

I've had mixed feelings about this place but for the most part the food is good. Seems to be pretty consistent on the food .  Always very tasty and good portions. 

Most folks are calling in and picking up. 
There is delivery available and that also seems popular. Rarely have I  seen anyone eating in the restaurant. 

The rating is A 91.5 .  Barely an A but it is still nonetheless an A. 

Again food is good ... So I will change my rating to 4 stars as this is a good restaurant. 
Just kinda minimal for a diner restaurant. Three tables and usually one table is full of employees stuff on it."}
{"text":"NEGATIVE STARS!!!! Just ordered tonight and after an hour and 15 minutes called to check on it. They said the driver was on the way. 20 minutes later i called to cancel and they said they'd call back that the driver should've delivered. Called back and said they delivered it. We never got it! We had to argue with them and eventually they said they'd call grub hub to report the issue. Our condos can be confusing but we gave specific instructions to our condo even down to a description of our building and door. So either they never even delivered or our neighbor stole it. 

On top of this, grub hub was FANTASTIC and did not charge us thank goodness. However this business stated to them that they did not agree with the complaint. Are you freaking kidding me???? Never ever again and how ridiculously unprofessional. You guys made a mistake and you won't even accept the responsibility. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Omg! Took a chance from our regular Place because we wanted Pad Thai. So glad we did! The general Tao chicken was superb, and the pad this was totally delicious! AsianWok is our new favorite!:)x"}
{"text":"Chicken was soggy and tasted like fish, teriyaki bowl bland, and ordered $30 worth of food to go-and no utensils or napkins.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place if your craving for a Chinese cuisine. Out of all the Chinese place weve been around Las Vegas this is the best ever.

A Must try:

1) Salt and pepper pork-chop ( ask to make it less salt and extra crispy)
2)Honey Walnut Shrimp (substitute the walnut with cashew)
3) Sesame Beef

One last thing if you spent $30 or more dont forget to ask your freebies a crab ragoon or fried wanton."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery.  Yelp order was easy to do, food came fast and my kids liked it.  Wasn't the best food in the world, but it was good and I'd order from here again"}
{"text":"I am a new fan of Asian Wok. We stopped by for Mother's Day. What luck they had a 5 course Mother's Day Special. We were hesitant but boy were we surprised. I don't know the name for the courses but it started off with Tofu, Squid, Shrimp Soup which we devoured quickly. Next was an apple, potato, egg, celery salad with some dressing.... OMG it was so good. The appetizer was steak, shrimp, some slaw, and it was all great. The meal was shrimp and chicken in a plum sauce with a side of fried rice. For dessert we had a small slice of cheesecake. It was all perfect. We found out that this is not on the menu and that it is a once a year thing. Wow we were happy we stopped in."}
{"text":"Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!!!!! Such wonderful food and service!!!  I live on the east side of town, but when I want authentic great-tasting Asian food the Asian Wok is the only restaurant I will visit! They are worth the drive!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I go back and forth with this place. I enjoy the fact that when you walk in this little Chinese place, the atmosphere is nice. The tables and booths are nice and presentable and it is just nice to look at. Sometimes when you go into a Chinese fast food place, the place looks a little run done and they never like to update their dining room.. but again it is new so they have that advantage, haha! The workers there are very pleasant as well. 

The food is good don't get me wrong, but there are other chinese food places that serve almost the same exact thing. Some of the dishes have more flavor than the others, just depending on what you like to order. Their Lo Mein is pretty yummy, has plenty of vegetables.. the honey walnut shrimp doesn't scream out anything different than the one at Little Dumping a few miles away from this place. Their beef and broccoli is the same as any other place as well. To me this place doesn't set themselves up for anything different besides. The prices are reasonable too, you can get plenty of food for a good price!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go, their Pad Thai is amazing I felt that it's even better than other Thai bistro restaurant. 
If you're looking for a fast  tasty Asian food this is for sure the place to go. They're services are wonderful, polite and fast. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"this is my first time ordering food here. i always go to (****)  to eat chinese food and this time i wanted to try different restaurant since it's only 5 minutes away from my house. when i got the food i was excited to eat it since i was starving and said that this food will taste better and to my surprised the food wasn't good at all !!!! i ordered honey walnut shrimp, pad-thai, fried rice and hot sour soup. all of it are not good!!! specially the honey walnut shrimp and pad-thai......I will not order here again...will give the food to the poor people in the street so i don't waste it...they will need to get a new cook."}
{"text":"I came here because I was in the mood for some Chinese. Oddly enough I thought this was going to be like an Asian noodle type place, but when I walked in and saw the menu realized it was just another Chinese takeout establishment. To my surprise the food was good. I ordered chicken and broccoli and an order of fried chicken wings. The chicken wings were fresh and hand battered, I loved them. The broccoli was especially yummy too. If I'm ever in the area I would definitely come back again. Too bad I live about 15 minutes away and that's just too far of a drive for me. Check them out."}
{"text":"The best Chinese sit down restaurant in NW Vegas. They sell lunch plates and dinner plates too. The only Chinese restaurant that does it for dinner. Quality is very good and taste clean. We prefer this restaurant over China One or Grand China. Restaurant is clean and so are their bathrooms. Would we go back for sit down or take out ABSOLUTELY ! The staff are nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Won't order again.  We had the food delivered.  The order was placed at 5:24p with an estimated delivery of 6:09-6:15p.  We didn't receive until 6:45p.  

The eggrolls were mushy (not crispy) and flavorless.  The Chicken Chow Mein did have noodles- super big starchy noodles.  I am use to veggies in my Chow Mein this had hardly any veggies.  I think it was way over priced.  Cost 138 w/ tip for 3 dinners and an order of Honey Walnut Shrimp.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp seemed as if it was from a frozen food box.  The shrimp and the batter on the shrimp had a very uniformed pattern.  Just won't do it again.  Panda Express is better.

Sorry, but No Thanks!"}
{"text":"I got the broccoli and beef with noodles instead of rice and dumplings. Everything was basically saltless. The beef tasted like rubber too. The dumplings were alright. The filling wasn't flavorful at all though. All in all, everything lacked seasoning and a lot of it. I might try it again one day, but for now I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"OMG!! This is the best Chinese food in Las Vegas ,the food was so good,and service was awesome,I recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family doesn't order places we don't go to regularly. But we really liked that today when we decided to do something different we were satisfied. I just really like Chinese food or just Asian food in general. So anything closest to Americanized Asian food meets my standards.

Most definitely will order again."}
{"text":"Sa cha chicken - had enough spice to it that I didn't have to ask for more heat. Which is good because I forgot to. 
Broccoli and chicken - decent amount and pretty standard. 
Egg rolls - yum. 
Hot and sour soup - not good. Too thick and not enough bamboo or mushroom. Also wasn't very spicy/hot. Wouldn't bother ordering this again. 
Fried rice - was tasty. 
My food showed up hot and in about 25 min. 
The app was super convenient to order, pay and tip."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the reviews, what a mistake. Ordered the Combo chow mein. and was told 10 minutes, 24 minutes later I received my order. when I got home, it was chicken only. So after going back to get the the correct order, the food was flavorless. And on top of all this I got 1 shrimp? Staff was polite, but I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese place in centennial hills! Great staff and great food! My husband and I have done both fine in and take out and are never disappointed! New favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food Chinese places I have ordered from yet! We ordered from grubhub and got the family meal A. We got 2 spring rolls, 2 crab rangoons, 2 sides of hot and sour soup, side of BBQ pork fried rice, and 2 entrees. The entrees we chose are sweet and sour pork and generals chicken. We also ordered an additional side of beef chow mein. Besides the food being cold/warmish when it arrived it was still rather delicious. The sweet and sour pork was crisp and had the perfect amount of breading. They also kept the sauce on the side to prevent them from getting soggy. The generals chicken was a little to sweet for my liking not very spicy at all. The spring rolls were amazing and the crab rangoon's to die for!!!Next time I will make sure to order extra! Also the chow mein was typical chow mein not to dry not to wet. I spent about $40 but had a grubhub coupon for $7 off so only paid about $33. Awesome place I will be back!"}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars as this food was ok not great. We did get the lunch special. Just average food but great service was its saving grace."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! I will never be patronizing this restaurant again. Ordered delivery on a Sunday evening. Food was terribly bland & they forgot my rice & noodles.  When I notified them of the error, they asked if I would come pick it up. I explained I couldn't. I then proceeded to wait over 40 minutes for them to deliver the missing rice. (Never got the noodles) Customer service is severely lacking. Did I mention how bad the food was? Be warned."}
{"text":"So good every time! Service is fast and friendly. I've tried about 5 or 6 different entrees. Cashew chicken and sesame chicken are amazing."}
{"text":"I just went back here again last night. I've been here about 5 times now. It's turning out to be one of my favorite - if not very favorite - Chinese places in the Northwest part of town. The food always comes out extremely fresh. Crunchy things are crunchy, soft things are soft, hot stuff is hot, sweet things are sweet, and spicy things are... well... sometimes spicy. You get a good amount of food for the price and they really do a great job with the flavors.

 Be sure to try the Garlic Shrimp or the Orange Chicken. Both are fabulous! 

 Service is hit and miss. Sometimes very attentive and sometimes aloof. But I don't go for the service, I go for the food; and the food is really really good. 

Xingshòu"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery & was disappointed. I got the combination fried rice & the meat was really floppy & not good quality. The crab ragoons arrived cold. Bleck. The hot N sour soup was also super bland which was a bummer. Just not a great meal so I'm disappointed we ordered so much. We order takeout a lot so this was a real shame."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Everything was incredibly bland, no flavor or heat. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I ate there the other day , I had crispy scallion chicken witch was really good . I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. Unusual for a Chinese  restaurant.  Food is prepared here for American customers.  A lot of sweet teriyaki sauce  in every item.  I wish they use  authentic chinese recipes.  Too much sugar for us but may be other customers don't mind. Friendly staff. They need a storage room to store stuff rather than in the dinning room."}
{"text":"We have come here approximately 8 times. The service and food have been excellent each time. The staff is awesome."}
{"text":"My mother and I love Chinese, and more often than not we do take out. I'm sure we're not alone in usually choosing the restaurant in closest proximity to home. For us that means ordering from China One, probably the most prolific chain in the region, but rather pedestrian in the food quality (worthy of no more than 3-stars). The next closest to home is Grand China. We went there twice (the 1st and Last time -- no likey!!)

Chinese food can vary significantly from one restaurant to the next. Not only are there regional differences between Szechuan, Cantonese and Mandarin recipes, but in \"Americanizing\" the dishes, the styles differ from east coast to Midwest to west coast. Our preconceived tastes are Midwest centric, and that's hard to find in Vegas. Most restaurants here are either more authentic Chinese (in Chinatown) or west coast Americanized (the rest of the city/region)

Today, we ventured a few more miles out of the way to try Asian Wok. Whenever we try a new place we order big....testing the dishes we tend to like best in order to evaluate the quality. From appetizers to each entre', all were far better at Asian Wok compared to every other joint we've tried since moving here in 2012. 

Our order included Crab Rangoon, Potstickers, Happy Family, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork in Garlic Sauce, Chicken Egg Foo Young and Chicken w/ String Bean. My only complaint was that I felt the string beans were a bit over cooked. 

All in all,  we both decided this would be our restaurant of choice from here on in. By far, it's some of the best Chinese we've had here. We can't wait to try more items as we plan to explore more dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Well, I normally handle my bad food experience with a live, learn and never again mentality. But this has brought that to a end just for the fact the rating is so high. I have to save at least one person from falling for this farce. 

First off, the order took 1 hr and 20 mins to get here. Then as we are opening our bag like a kid on Christmas with glee in our eyes and hunger in our bellies, having forgotten completely about how long it took to get here....I notice the greasy bags I keep pulling out one after another. Then, we realize we are missing our White rice but the grand finale of our unveiling was the BAG filled with SOUP that included the containers floating in it. Upon further review, I notice that one soup had melted through the container lid of the other and planted itself inside of it. 

Now... the food. It was cold, the rice was greasy (not even sure how you can pull that one off), the chicken in our Sesame and Generals was dried out so bad the dog rejected his favorite time of the night... table scraps. As a few other reviews stated, the Egg Roll tasted weird, like some alien meat stuffed into a paper towel then rolled up.  As for the soup... No idea, no one in the family was willing to stick a straw in the bag to try it. 

In summary: Move on down the list to the next Chinese place."}
{"text":"My husband and I are quite fond of this place. Delivery is usually quick and the food is always hot when it arrives. I normally opt for the curries they have on the menu. I find the Penang and green curry satisfying when something like Archi's or Pin Kaow is out of the question. 
Overall good for neighborhood takeout. My only complaint is that the prices are a bit high. Well worth it when I don't want to cook though!"}
{"text":"I knew there was one place I didn't want to order from again.  Unfortunately I didn't mark the name down, but I have now.  Burnt food and tasteless entrees 2 times in a row rates a very rare 1 star from me."}
{"text":"The Chinese food is really good from here and they deliver really fast if you live close. I'm not a huge fan of their Thai food but I love their fried rice and the Teriyaki bowls. I order from here twice a week."}
{"text":"Looks like a new location. Food was good, price was good, service was awesome. Will definitely come back and get delivery too!"}
{"text":"The food was very bland, it took over an hour for them to deliver it and the guy that delivered it was extremely short with me and pushy."}
{"text":"Ordered here for pick up late afternoon today.  We have been coming here for a while, and food was pretty decent, esp. if you don't want to run all the way to spring mtn.  But today's order was tastier than usual  We normally get the same things: potstickers, soup( hot&sour today), chicken with greenbns, Asian wok delight, and then got something different- the eggplant in garlic sauce.  Everything was extra delicious and super savory today, even tho I have a cold I could still taste all the different flavors!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go and it was a good experience, and the people were very nice! I got Hot and Spicy dinner combo and told my girl that I loved it, she also enjoyed her sesame chicken. Problem is both of us were sick at our stomach all night! 

Not a good experience and threw the rest away today!"}
{"text":"This will be a short and sweet review. 

Go with the basics. Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pad Thai. Those are ok. 

I have tried the following and don't recommend them. 

Tom Yum soup. Shrimp was way over cooked and also I know what shrimp should smell like and the soup smelled a little too fishy which means they weren't so fresh. It's a very basic soup not enough mushrooms, or other ingredients. They were very scarce. And super spicy doesn't mean flavorful! Just like putting in a ton of salt doesn't make it taste better. 

General tsaos chicken... Made me sick 



I hate that this place is the okayest in the area. We need better options. 

I also hate that they nickel and dime you here."}
{"text":"I really don't know where these negative reviews came from. From the competition maybe? In any event, I would disregard them as far as the food goes. It is true that there are only a couple small tables in the place. 

This is an outstanding Chinese take out place! I have never had delivery from them so I can't speak to that but everything that I have had from them has been delicious! The serving sizes are quite large so the value is there too! I usually call in my order and it's always ready when I get there. I sometimes go early to pick up my food so that I can watch them cook through the kitchen window. They are true masters of wok cooking!"}
{"text":"Dinner combo with chicken chow mein and chicken fried rice comes with an egg roll a crab Rangoon and soup. It's plenty of food. Bathroom and the restaurant is very clean which is important and nice. We were seated quickly for 5pm dinner. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Will be back for good food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tom Ka Ga soup and it was great. The pad Thai was just okay. It didn't taste like any pad Thai I have ever had, and it was a little dry.  They did use quality, well trimmed chicken breast, which I appreciate.  They delivered my food without utensils. Not a big deal, but a little annoying. 

Delivery time was good. I was confused because I ordered online through beyondmenu.com and it looked like they charged me (I could see the charge in my online banking), but they ran my card when they arrived. I was worried about being charged twice and the manager was very nice about explaining what they were doing and told me to ask for him if for some reason I was charged twice. He assured me that I wasn't and as of now, I haven't been. 

I like that their delivery minimum is relatively low, and that they were polite.  I am not sure I loved my entree, but the soup was good."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. You get an excellent portion size for the lunch special. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because during the online ordering process, ordering the correct soup and adding the $.50 for to-go/delivery isn't possible. I checked out online with a card and then got a call asking if I could give $2.15 in cash to the delivery driver to cover the to-go cost for 4 soups. Overall, great food but I wish ordering online didn't have the issues it did."}
{"text":"I ordered Sesame chicken, vegetable fried rice, vegetable egg foo yung and vegetable chow mein. To me all of it had a fishy after taste and some kind of dusty feel on my tongue like too much flour or cornstarch. I won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Order here few times.The food is generally great. Servers are friendly, delivery for last couple times take less than 40 mins. Will be ordering again. Hope they stay in business. One of my favorite restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some Thai food and saw this small, but nice looking restaurant. Their menu has plenty of variety, with both Chinese and Thai dishes. They even have a lunch menu with great prices.

We had the Tom Kha soup. It came in the traditional bowl with the flame in the center. My wife is a vegetarian, so we ordered it with tofu. The soup was great.

I had the red curry with beef. It was a huge serving, so guess what, I have lunch! It had the right amount of spice for me and I really enjoyed it.

They don't have beer or wine, but hopefully they can get a license for it."}
{"text":"Good location for a new Chinese restaurant. The salt and pepper squid was great. The Asian Wok Delight and Hong Kong pan fried noodles were excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Hard to rate yet but based on my first experience,  I have no real complaint.  BBQ pork was very tasty in the sauce but like  their competitors,  not likely  fresh made.  The sauce was so tasty i didn't care, I just wanted hot sauce. Beef chow mein was not salty or over flavored and even my 4 year okd liked the beef.  (FYI he doesn't  wat bland or basic)  The interior  was clean and the sraff friendly.   Did not wait long for my take out.  I was bummed  they did not offer rare beef soup,  I  hate driving  all the way to Spring Mountain exit.  We have a SERIOUS lack of ANY good Chinese food on the north side, so I  hope they maintain the  quality.  Can't  speak for the Thai part of the menu yet."}
{"text":"BLANDBLANDBLANDBLANDBLAND.

Who the phuck is grading this place 4/5 stars??!
No authentic taste- what so ever.

-Native Vegas people -I'm so sorry you don't know what \"AUTHENTIC\" Chinese food taste like and are stuck with this. Shoot, you can find a better place than this in the hood of Long Beach on Pine street.


Passpasspasspass."}
{"text":"The hostess seated us immediately and took our drink order.  We then ordered the red curry Thai chicken. Shrimp an broccoli,shrimp fried rice and 2 egg rolls. We did not wait long and the food was exceptional. All the food looked and tasted very fresh. I have never had such wonderful flavors before. We are hooked. This is our go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the area. Great prices for lunch and dinner and huge portions!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Ordered the beef chow fun and tom yum soup, both were very good!!! Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's just like the best Chinese! It's fresh and so flavorful. So happy I live on this side of town so I can have it when I want!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant on a whim since I live in the area and wanted Chinese food. Service was great. The staff helped me immediately when I walked in and took my takeout order and the food came out promptly in about 15 minutes. The food was another story though. It was below average; I couldn't even make it more than three bites into my wonton soup. Everything else we ordered was bland. I would not recommend this restaurant. Just drive to China one for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I live 9 minutes away from this place and I waited 2 hours for a delivery of orange chicken and shrimp chow mein. Never received my food, and was hung up on the second they found out I cancelled my order from grubhub."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday being my daughters favorite place. I don't know how to say it other than they are losing their touch. Doesn't seem as quality as it use to be. Yes soups were great but the meals weren't as good as they usually are. Chicken was slimy and chewy, even taste like shrimp. Almost no vegetables at all. I'm not sure if we will be back for awhile. I think we will research some new places around next time we have a craving for Chinese food. The wait staff is always very attentive and friendly, thank you for that."}
{"text":"AWESOME! The dinning room is nice, very clean. The service is friendly and quick. Our drinks never went bellow half full, our server came by to make sure everything was ok very often and the food was ready extremely fast. The food is on point! Tasted delicious. We had wor wonton soup and yellow curry. Broth and pork are the two complaints I usually have at other restaurants but I didn't have any complaints here. Asian woks broth AND pork was flavorful, delicious! Their chicken yellow curry had the right amount of spice, came with chicken, carrots, potatoes and onion, all cooked to perfection. I am so glad to say that I've found my new favorite restaurant in my neighborhood. I will be dinning in and ordering out very often. Will definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"They have a new location near farm. It took over two hours to get our food. I actually had to reheat on the stove since we do not use a microwave. It's literally a 10 minute walk from our house. The food was cold and crappy! Go to China One around the block on Durango! This place sucks."}
{"text":"Waited a bit after opening to beat the crowds. This place is fantastic. Beats Grand China and China One hands down. Love the food, and plenty of it. The service was awesome. Next time we will order delivery to see how long it takes other than that great place. Glad they opened up so close to home."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent our July 4th dinner there before the firework event.  The hot and spice soup was good. Pad Thai was too sweet. Page service not bad though."}
{"text":"Just had dinner Kung Pao Triple delight.  They just opened last month and they are close to where I live. The food is excellent, lots of fresh vegetables that are not overcooked.  The presentation is exceptional.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"I must say this place is pretty awesome.

Everyone is very nice and friendly.


I can't forget to mention if you walk in this place and order take out which I ushually order only maybe 2 items or 3, they get it out to you super fast and it's always so fresh idk how the hell they do it!


Blows grand china away up the street in the Albertsons parking lot. 


I recently ordered  the Singapore rice noodles veggie only because I'm a vegetarian and it was amazing! If your craving something with a super hot curry flavored that's the dish for you!

I can't forget to mention they have more than one vegan dish which is pretty damn cool! 

I highly recommend trying this place! 

I do sometimes wish they had some dim sum and maybe those little red bean sesame balls they are so good but I can't find them anymore around this part of town!! 

Anyways everything is very fresh, clean and yummy!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh n hot! I ordered the chicken n vegetables and I loved every bite. I will return and def didn't have any issues with service. Some humans have to understand karma, you give bad energy it will be returned. I came in 1 hr before closing and I had great service from the lady who took my order to the man that prepared and served my food. 

Just order some food and enjoy and stop complaining about the amount of tables or workers have to eat Bc they work to cook your food."}
{"text":"Very good.  For 50$ I fed my family of 5 and have left overs.  Orange chicken and chow mien were very good."}
{"text":"We've adopted this as our go to place for order in Asian.  We decided to order something new everytime to figure which dishes we love most.  That changed with the Singapore noodle- we had that and is now a definite staple in every order. We've discovered that nothing on the \"specials\" list disappoints, the curries and such, delicious.  We also discovered that the generic orders (orange chicken, Sweet and sour, ect) are okay at best and don't care to order it ever again

After about a year, our *staple* order is looks like this:

Hot/sour soup 
Crab rangoons 
vege egg rolls
Singapore noodles (med) 
Some Another dish.... Probably a curry/specialty item"}
{"text":"First time order online.  A takeout order I intended to pickup because it was over 6 miles away (concerned about delivery for such a distance), but I accidentally ordered it as a delivery.  Our order arrived piping hot in 30 minutes (very impressive), and it was very good.  It was the best egg foo young we've ever had.  The variety of vegetables was impressive, and nothing was over cooked. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery and they forgot a crucial item: THE RICE! when I called they said they would send a driver back to deliver some rice so we can eat our food with it and he would be back with the rice in about 12 minutes.... 30 minutes later no rice. Called back they said they would call the driver... 30 more minutes later no damn rice. Horrible customer service when I called again they said the driver was busy with OTHER DELIVERIES! I guess I'm no longer a priority because they already had my money... Needless to say we ate the orange chicken without any rice and  I called and told them to call the driver and tell him not to come. The driver came anyway a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes later making my dogs bark like crazy waking up my 10 month old who I just put to bed. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Finally! A Chinese delivery joint in Pineville that has good food! Crisp vegetables, egg-cellent egg drop soup, Yaki Udon noodles were fantastic, shrimp was big and plentiful in the noodles and dinner combo dishes. Fried rice was spot-on. Chicken wings were not greasy, flavored just right. Typical Chinese takeout fare on the menu, but done right, hot and fast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere and wonderful service!

We happened upon this little restaurant by chance and so enjoyed our meal. To top it off, we were surprised to find out that it had only been open a week! Here's to hoping it stays open for years to come. The food was wonderful. The service was exceptional - even the cook came out to make sure we were enjoying our meal! We will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here after reading all the good reviews. Sadly, after an hour long wait, we got pretty sub par Chinese food. The fried rice was bland, dry, and not very good. The sweet and sour chicken was rough and tough fried bits of what seemed to look like leftover dried out meat. The spring rolls were below average and were not crispy at all on the outside. My sister got the orange chicken which she said was just alright. Not the best $40 I've ever spent by far.There are better options for Chinese around this area so I don't think we will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I agree with Jeff , I don't know why they have any bad reviews. The food is great the takeout Services the bomb. If there's anything negative it's limited seating"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this establishment. The vegetable roll=amazing. Pad Thai= yes... Fantastic. Fried rice and garlic chicken= so good! My son and I are kind of picky about vegetables but ordering online with specific requests was really easy, and everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time going to Asain Wok (11/17/17). All the food was really good. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was for the service. The dining room wasnt busy at all but it took a long time to place our drinks order and even longer to get our drinks. To be fair they had a very large to go order, which consisted of at least 8 bags full of food. When it came to getting our food, between the 5 of us nobody got their food at the same time. I'm not talking about a couple minutes, I mean like 10-15 minutes per meal. The couple I was with ordered off the combo dinner meals and they liked everything they had. My family had the sweet n sour chicken, honey walnut shrimp, chicken chow fun and crab Rangoon. Again everything we ate was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was great, inexpensive and quick. I'm the person who always goes to Panda for chow mein. Well I've found a new place, service was quick and the food was even better."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was fresh and delicious :) the orange beef was the highlight of our meal!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times because it's so close to work. The parking lot has a horrible layout but it's always empty. The food is always done quickly and it's pretty good! The only entree I haven't liked so far has been the General Tso's chicken. It was just bland and boring. 

Also wasn't a fan of their beef. I've tried beef fried rice and beef teriyaki bowl and it just doesn't look or taste or feel like beef. It's rubbery and weird.

Aside from the beef though it's fairly priced and my go-to for lunch."}
{"text":"I need to let people know,  this place is great. The restaurant was very clean, service was very friendly, food was great, & the price was very reasonable. We took enough home for a whole nother."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food had general Tso chicken and fried rice. I've also tried the egg foo young which I really like, they have a different type of sauce not the typical brown gravy. Service has been good so far."}
{"text":"Sooo good, we just tried them for the first time and the presentation was great and overall taste and flavor...I got the panang curry and  tom kha with chicken and my hubby got the wonton soup and the shrimp fried rice..we also got a strawberry slush and a boba milk tea...it was satisfying and everything tasted fresh including the boba in the drink :) it didn't take too long to arrive and we will be ordering from them again the next time we get a taste for something ethnic mm mm mmmmm!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from here and I'm on the fence as to whether or not it will be my last.

I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein dinner combo and an order of boneless ribs (about $20 due to delivery fee and taxes). The combo came with a crab Rangoon and a spring roll, choice of steamed or fried rice (I chose fried), and a choice of hot and sour soup or chicken and corn soup (I chose chicken). 

Crazy fast delivery. Then again they're only 5 minutes down the street. It took 30 minutes to arrive from the time I placed my order online. 

The noodles were very good, spring roll was delicious, and crab Rangoon gets a thumbs up. Boneless ribs were OK, I would maybe get them again.

What brought my rating down was the fried rice. It was so terribly bland! Some added soy sauce did the trick to make it edible but I was extremely disappointed. I would not expect such a staple of Chinese takeout to be cooked so poorly. I would trade the speedy delivery for more care on the rice in a heartbeat.

TLDR; Overall I may order from here again if I'm craving Chinese takeout, but I'll skip the rice and trade the ribs for some pot stickers or shrimp. If they up their rice game this would easily earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I have tasted since being in Vegas. Tony is always friendly and has a smile on his face. This is my go to Chinese restaurant. I have tried several items on the menu and never have I been disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was fantastic! The dining area is small but cozy and kept very clean!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment and the service was the best but the food....not so great and the prices were kind of high."}
{"text":"The food is usually good, but as of lately it has been pretty bland. It's disappointing because this used to be our go to spot."}
{"text":"Maybe they read their reviews.  No complaints, food is very good and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"excellent chinese food :-)
chef is from NEW YORK .. Tastes like good NY takeout"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting for this place to open up.  There isn't any good Chinese food around this area/close by and trust me we have been looking.  We just moved from cali and you can usually find a place every other corner. We came on their opening day and got the lunch specials. I got Mongolian beef and he got cashew chicken. We absolutely loved it! We went a second time and tried the sweet and sour and orange chicken and loved that too. The lunch portions are great and they come with soup and a egg roll or crab rangoons.  We will definitely be taking our family soon to try the sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, the soup was amazing. Very surprised they were not busy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is purely from the perspective of finding a modest, local, family owned Chinese (they also have Thai dishes) take-out joint. We've ordered delivery from here several times. The food comes in less than 30 mins to Providence; real quick! The food is always hot and delicious. We've also, sat down to eat.  The place is clean and the service is above par. The owner did come and give us complimentary freshly cut oranges after our meal. They have some very good lunch specials that run from 11a - 4p. I defiantly can say that the taste, quality, and price of the food is a step above Panda Express. I would recommend coming here if you need that quick fix from a family owned business."}
{"text":"Delivery..... food was actually great for a delivery service. Also, the delivery came on time (as stated on their delivery time estimate). Would order again"}
{"text":"I ordered the Family Dinner B with a modification where I got Chicken and Broccoli instead of the listed Shrimp and Broccoli.

The wonton soup came in 2 little containers and the wontons reminded me of the kind that would come in my soup back in NY.

I also got 2 fried shrimp, 2 crab rangoons and 2 \"egg\" (really spring) rolls. The appetizers were what I expected. The soup had really good flavor.

Then I had combo fried rice which had really good flavor. The shrimp chow mein was alright. Not all that amazing and the Chicken and Broccoli was really good!

My only negatives were the chow mein and the fact that my order was lacking the noodles that you usually get with every order. They also make their own spicy mustard homemade and it was really good too!

I ordered ONLINE (which is awesome) and I drove over there. The place is really cute and clean inside. They had some tables and booths set up and some people were eating there.

Anyway this place blows away Grand China and China One! Oh and the people working were really nice too! Always a plus!"}
{"text":"There are 3 or 4 Chinese restaurants close to our house. But we choose to always come back to this one. The food is great the prices are reasonable and the staff is so so sweet. They always remember us and are super nice and patient with my two boys."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fast service and good prices. I would recommend the lunch specials since the portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - the food was delivered before the promised time and it was really delicious."}
{"text":"Wish I had checked this review board before we ordered. Our Pad Thai, Yellow Curry and Penang Curry were the most disgusting attempts at Thai I've ever experienced. The ratings are high and after throwing 95% of our food down the disposal I just can't figure out why"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since I read decent reviews and close to my house. I like the food. The majority of Chinese restaurants around here do not taste so great. This place has it right. The fried rice isn't overly salty from too much soy sauce. I ordered Kung Pao chicken and it was great. I also ordered the salt and pepper squid and it was pretty good. I'm glad to know that there's a great place for Chinese food near my house. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delivery is faster than the speed of light it seems. I ordered over the phone with a pleasant young lady who answered all of my questions. The portion sizes are generous, and the price is comparable to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow. 

Every single time we order from this place, they're amazingly quick to get it to our home. 

The food here is great take out and super cheap. 

Quick tips for dishes:

Szechuan Scallops
Mongolian beef
Any ribs 
Pot stickers

Want great and insanely quick take out? I just told you. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Since discovering this place we have ordered takeout from here about once a week. I am really picky with Chinese food and everything we have ordered has been great! The portions are huge so one meal and an appetizer are more than enough for the two of us. The hot and sour soup is VERY GOOD too. Also they have a super fast delivery time and the food is always hot when it arrives. I would highly reccomend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is very good and the atmosphere was very welcoming. The place is clean. The staff are very friendly. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lot's of good food for the money.  A little hard to find.  Behind Nevada Nat'l Bank and worth the search"}
{"text":"Our fave chinese restaurant!! Everytime we go here we order Salt & Pepper Porkchop, Honey Walnut Shrimp, House Chow Fun and cream cheese rangoons. We've tried their mongolian beef and steamed fish with a brown sauce (i forgot) once and it's good. If you want to get bobba in this place, get the taro and thai tea, i won't recommend their milk tea."}
{"text":"The best Chinese take food in Charlotte till date. Great taste and portions with low prices. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the salt and pepper squid.  It was salty and rubbery, and not crispy.  The Singapore rice noodles were bland, and the scarce amount of chicken wasn't fresh.  The Ocean Seafood Platter was the worst thing I think I have ever eaten.  There were no scallops, only a few pieces of shrimp, and a lot of rubbery artificial crabmeat.  It tasted old!  My dog Bella wouldn't even eat their food.  This was our first time eating here and it will most definitely be our last.  Only one person in the restaurant at 6:00 pm.  I can't express just how disappointed we were!"}
{"text":"Beautiful clean establishment. Ordered the general chicken lunch special, the chicken was cooked perfectly, sauce was amazing, had the egg drop soup very good, vegetable egg roll was also great. I'd highly recommend checking this place out good price and great tasting food! 

Look forward to trying more items"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Called to cancel order 30 seconds after ordering online (wrong location) and had a guy yell at us telling us we had to come in to do that. He screamed on the phone saying there was no manager there. I'm in shock!"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday luncheon this afternoon, and although it is really difficult for me to give 5 stars on most ANYTHING, this place deserves it. Prompt service, nice servers and Hot food HOT (in temp and seasoning) and cold food cold. You can get spicy mustard or ot chili oil for mnore daredevil tastes. Kept drinks filled, sang Happy Birthday in Chinese and overall GREAT food. Sesame chicken, Cashew Shrimp, Chef graced tables with AWESOME APP of Walnut Shrimp, along with egg roll or 2 Crab Rangoons, chow mein/fried rice or 1/2 or 1/2. Quartered oranges, Almond cookies and Fortune Cookies for dessert. The restaurant is tucked away but across from Nevada State Bank. Clean, lots of seating and lunch menu price was $8.00 on average. Find it and you WILL go again and again!!"}
{"text":"A great Chinese restaurant close to my house!!! Finally! Oh and they have Thai food too!! We ordered the fried shrimp appetizer, salt and pepper pork chops and red curry chicken. All were delicious. the pork wasn't as crispy as food express but the flavors were all there. Portions were generous and the staff are super friendly. I was told the chef has been cooking for over 25 years and hails from New York. Either way ...I couldn't be more happy that this place is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The orange chicken and fried rice are the best I've ever had, no lie. Hot and sour soup is amazing also. The staff is incredible. One of my favorite places ever!!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was the best Chinese food restaurant in centennial, but not anymore. I spent $48 on my meal, delivery. It took 1 1/2 hours to get my food. I called to ask if the order was placed, and I was told that the driver was on his way...30 minutes later...."}
{"text":"Our second visit to Asian Wok since 4/20/2016 when at that time i was truly unhappy with one of the dishes i ordered (General Tso Chicken). Upon this visit we were well satisfied with the food as well as the service. This is the food we keep coming back for. I ordered Vegetable Shrimp with Brown rice which was very good. We had the Crispy Chicken Wings was simply great, hot and super crispy. Wife had her standard fare of egg foo young with no complaints there."}
{"text":"Today I ordered for delivery using Grub Hub. The food arrived incredibly fast. The delivery person was very sweet. I ordered the Kung pao shrimp which came with a big side of rice. Being that I had to order a minimum of $15, I decided on pork lumpia (egg rolls). Everything was incredible. I do wish the sauce for the Kung pao shrimp was spicy and thicker than a water texture. I love spicy food and it wasn't spicy AT ALL (which is my reason behind the 4 stars). But the shrimp were cleaned nicely and cooked to perfection. I will also add that they were big shrimp and they give you a nice amount. I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"One of the better places for delivery when you're craving for Chinese or Thai food. I prefer the Thai menu side.  The Panang Curry with shrimp was delicious and so was the shrimp Tom Kha soup."}
{"text":"For the price, most of the food is pretty good. You can't go wrong with the chicken lettuce cups and the wonton soup. The fried rice tastes like it's pre-packaged and their pad thai isn't the best, but everything else is alright to great. Asian Won is a lot better than Panda Express. However, if you're looking for really fancy asian food just go to PF Changs. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Fantastic new Asian food joint.  My wife and I had the Mongolian Beef dinner plate.  The portion was large enough to split for both of us.  It had great flavor and was not overly spicy at all (even tho the menu says it is spicy)

I will be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here, but was VERY disappointed. Delivery took almost an hour,  but I can forgive that on a Friday night. Food was generally terrible,  but maybe I just ordered poorly. 

Summary of my order:
Tofu Pad Thai - bland and awful even with medium spiciness
Crab Rangoon (cheese wontons) - not terrible, very cream cheesy. I prefer China One for theirs. 
Egg rolls - strange filling  (I wasn't a fan)
Pot Stickers - Fair, but dry by the time they were delivered to me."}
{"text":"We arrived the hostess/waitress and only person helping the entire dining room took our drink orders. We don't receive our drink  before she comes back to take our order. We give our order and about five minutes later we receive our drinks(15 minutes after we arrived)
After we finally got our drinks we got our pot stickers and soup. The corn soup and pot stickers tasted fresh and were hot. 
Our plates of food came shortly after we were finished appetizers.  This was thirty minutes after we had arrived. 

The food wasn't the greatest I've had but it wasn't terrible. My favorite was the corn soup and the fried rice! 

The waitress was very busy but was very nice. The restaurant is clearly understaffed and the bald man in the back came out yelling at her during our wait. He was actually quite frightening and you can tell he upset the young girl. 
Hope that her day gets better and they offer her up some help!!"}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai I have ever had, took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. Thai is one of my favorite types of food and I always try the Pad Thai first because it shows if they know what they are doing or not. They don't."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here, it looks like a Chinese fast food take out but it's not!  Great Thai curry and eggplant dish. They were also great with making item vegan. Big portions and a great deal!
Service was fast and the place is very very clean."}
{"text":"New fast food Chinese right across from CMC Pineville.  The food is good.  And the prices are definitely affordable.  I've ordered delivery several times and they always get the food to me quickly and its still hot.  I always have to let it cool before digging in.  Great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it got here exactly when it said and food was still hot. Most of what we ordered was really good. The hot and sour soup and pot stickers were yummy. The Singapore rice noodle tasted great but thought it would have some spice to it. The pad thai on the other hand we did not like at all. It had little flavor and was oddly grainy. We will definitely order again though because everything else was great and there is so much on the menu we want to try."}
{"text":"I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about. This is now my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. The best roast duck I've had in a while. The skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was perfect. The pork fried rice was as good as any New York pork fried rice. It reminds me of Wolfgang Puck's , Shin Wa's fried rice when they were here. The Wonton soup was also very good. The sweet and sour chicken, well, was sweet and sour chicken. That's going to be a pretty average dish no matter where you get it. My waitress Zoey had a great personality and was helpful. I hope they'll deliver to my zip code."}
{"text":"My husband is an uber fan, so we are here often. I swear sometimes when we get delivery the food is at our doorstep as soon as we hang up the phone. It's nice they're open holidays too. The food is always as expected. We always get the shrimp fried rice and lemon chicken. Over two ears peeing the same dishes and it's always been awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:38pm.. it's now 8:22pm and I'm just now getting my food .. I'm pregnant and highly pissed off. They're literally 4 minutes from my house.. How were they not here on time? I should have just ordered carry out had I known I'd be waiting this dang long for some dang fried rice and chicken. They did this before and I gave them benefit of the doubt this time would be different but they failed me yet again. I'm definitely ordering from China One next time. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and delivered ahead of schedule! We live in a condo the delivery man came right to our door (which is actually very rare with other deliveries for some reason and we usually have to go to the front). He was very kind and prompt. Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Food is really good.I eat here at least once a week .I bring any of my friends to this restaurant .they're services are wonderful. 
Hongkong pan fried noodle is my favor.and also I recommend the Singapore rice noodle,sesame beef.those are soooo good.
Give it a try,you will like here also."}
{"text":"The food was not good at all! My 2 year old and I shared the sweet and sour chicken and it was pretty much tasteless and the fried rice seemed to have way too much teriyaki in it. The hot and sour soup was bland as well. After a crappy dinner my son woke up the next day vomiting all over the place and I started shortly after. We spent a good 48 hours puking everything we ingested up (which is not what you want to doing while 20 weeks pregnant). The only person who didn't get sick was my husband who had the mongolian beef."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriends parents go to place for Asian food. Admittedly, I'm not a huge Asian food fan but I do love me some chow mein so I was in to try somewhere new!
We were seated immediately and had quick, great service. It probably took about 15 minutes from ordering to getting our food which always makes me wonder if the food was really freshly made, but I was starving so I wasn't going to think too much into it! Maybe it's quick food to make, who knows! 
I ordered the beef chow mein. The beef was chewy, I wasn't a big fan of that. It wasn't anything special, it filled me up which is what I wanted, but I'm not sure if I wasn't starving I wouldn't pick somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I were searching for a new quick Chinese takeout since the one we usually go to is no longer open on sundays. Hesitant at first, since I read a few reviews but we are so happy we took the chance. Great sized portions for the price and the lady who we placed our to go order with was very friendly. Food was bomb! New go-to takeout"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in town. Sweet and sour chicken with steamed rice. 10 beef wontons. 6 crab rangoons and a huge plate of shrimp pad thatfor 40$! Lots of food for two people! Everything was delivered and still steaming. Will order from here again."}
