{"text":"Food and service were great for the most part.

 My \"huge\" burrito was really just average sized, but tasty and made vegan without hassle. Our server was great and the food came out quickly, but the owner (?) running around micromanaging everything was a bit of a downer. He was talking down to the staff and rearranging patrons during our entire meal. I actually got a little angry when he gathered everyone around to watch him change the till tape while giving slow, detailed instructions. 

I'll watch the reviews and maybe if this was a one off I\"ll go back, but in all honesty I felt so awkward and bad for the staff that I didn't enjoy my first meal. Great food and service (from the server) though."}
{"text":"At night, Kicker's Deli slicks his hair back, puts on a sombrero and goes by Alejandro's, a Mexican cantina with authentic food and tasty margaritas. When Maria told me about it, I had to try it out, and I had to try it out with her (and Wendy, Shannon, and surprise! Art!).

(Personally, the name \"Alejandro's\" for a restaurant always reminds me of that episode in Friends where Monica becomes a food critic, and lambasts Alessandro's marinara sauce for having zero flavor. Then she gets an angry visit to her apartment: \"This is Alessandro! From Alessandro's!\" )

Save for a small sandwich-board sign outside and a handwritten menu on a whiteboard, nothing about Alejandro's screams \"taqueria.\" On the inside, it's still Kicker's, because as per the agreement with the deli, they don't put up any decor, which further lends to the \"top sekrit\" atmosphere. You're welcomed inside by a beautiful waitress that greets you with a complimentary margarita shot. For a small place, the music is rather loud, but I like that they play Mexican music. 

The margaritas in Alejandro's are delicious. I started off with the Passionfruit flavor, but after having drink envy, I ordered the Tamarind Margarita as well. They're light, refreshing, and possibly deadly, because they go down super easy. I love their chili salt on the rim. They also carry Jarritos sodas and Mexican beers like Negra Modelo.

I was the last person to get my food, after a lengthy wait. The chef came out and personally apologized in Spanish. I ordered their taco platter with verde veggie filling, which comes with three soft tacos, and some rice and black beans on the side. While I thought the filling was uniquely flavored (and I loved the guacamole it came with), it was hampered by the corn tortillas which tasted microwaved and overly chewy. By the time I got to the third taco, I gave up on trying to eat it with the tortilla. The red tomato rice was delicious, but the black beans were extremely salty. 

So, a few kinks to work out. They are brand-new, and I'm looking forward to coming back and trying them out again! At any rate, I would definitely come back for more Margaritas."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food prepared by engaging and passionate people.  You might find it a little on the pricey side, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Drinks were expensive.... large virgin margarita (non-alcholic) for $20?!?!?!? WOA!!!!

ok, but I love that there was a fish ceviche (as I am allergic to shrimp and most ceviches have shrimp), so I ordered it and it was delicious!!!

p.s. very small place."}
