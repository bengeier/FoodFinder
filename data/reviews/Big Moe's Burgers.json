{"text":"Been here a couple times over the years now and overall its a great place to grab a burger if you're near the area. 

For the burgers themselves, the juicy lucy is the special burger that they make where there is cheese stuffed in the patty. Great idea but i question if its worth it because you could just buy a cheese burger for a slightly cheaper price and have an evenly distributed amount of cheese on your burger. Overall the burgers are great, the fact that they are halal makes the beef have a different taste to it though. Nothing bad about the taste of the beef, but just something important to note. 

The downside for big moe's I'd say would be the fact that their methods for cooking fries always seems to be constantly changing. I havent recently tried their fries but in the past it wasn't as crispy as I'd like, the waffle fries were ok though. Im also sad they took out the tornado chips (reason being was that it was too time consuming to make).

But what really makes me wanna come back to big moes is the deals they have. Recently they have deals through Mon to Wed (iirc) for burgers which is awesome; considering these are made right in front of you, fresh off the grill. I'd recommend not going during the usual rush hours though because your gonna have to wait for a while. Lastly this is the only place within the area with funnel cake, which is something much needed in the summer."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. I'm not sure if they recently just started serving those chicken burgers.. but man they are SO good. Nowhere near dry and very flavourful! The owners are also very nice and friendly and at times they tend to strike up a conversation with you!"}
{"text":"First time trying out Big Moe's Burgers, thanks to a Groupon offer.  First impressions... get this, they had to \"grind more meat\", and they \"ran out of chicken\".  Seriously???  I also had to ask the dude behind the counter if he was handling cash AND also handling the food, 'cause I saw him doing both!  Ok, still waiting for food, but just on the first impression (prior to eating)... not the greatest.  

Update:  Food turned out to be really good!"}
{"text":"Just left the door, this place has potential. The staff was very welcoming and took our orders promptly. The atmosphere is simple, nothing over the top. The heater made the dining experience uncomfortable. It almost seemed like the heater was meant to deter you from eating at the restaurant. I ordered a juicy Lucy with an extra patty and a poutine. The quality reminded me of a backyard barbecue. There was no depth in taste and quality. The refrigerator was overstocked with cans off pop making it difficult to cool the cans at an enjoyable temperature. Needless to say my pop was cool rather than cold. The wait time for my meal was just over fifteen minutes. All of the above can be worked on. Unfortunately I will not be returning until these things are improved."}
{"text":"Love funnel cakes. Used to go to CNE just for them. Big moes funnel cakes are pretty good, better than CNE in fact. Price is acceptable, it's quite huge and can be shared between 2-3 ppl. Not a good as wonderlands but this would be my go to place for funnel cakes whenever I get a craving in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and some fries. Oddly, they do not accept any other form of payment other than cash. 

Burger was very dry and lacking any kind of seasoning. Bun was heated on the grill and tasted meaty.  Took 2 bites and literally threw away burger! 

Also fries were burnt looking. If I could give a rating of 0, I would, but Yelp only allows a minimum of 1 star."}
{"text":"Best amongst all the Big Moe's. Had the chicken juicy Lucy and it was amazing! To top it all off, great family running the business! Gave us a complimentary funnel cake :)"}
{"text":"For halal burgers this is my number one place.  Love the food and the service. Price is a bit too much but I dont mind it when I like the place."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, but the burgers were extremely tasteless and funnel cake  too.

dirty and very shabby place.  Avoid"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I got the double juicy lucy with a poutine. The patty was juicy and bun was soft. Poutine had great flavor with the fries they use. I wish there was a bit more flavor but it definitely wasn't bad. 

Went a second time and got the regular juicy lucy with tornado fries. Burger was still great with no complaints. If you've never been, I definitely recommend trying the tornado fries."}
{"text":"I'm super confused....as to why people even come here. Its just another mediocre burger joint. The location is awkward too, you can easily miss it ( which would actually be a good thing!) 

I ordered the juicy lucy on the day they had it on special although I still paid too much for this sham of a burger. It tasted like a burger you could make at home........actually no, because the burgers I make at home taste great!

The burger was dry, the meat was utterly flavorless, the cheese was typical and the bun was unappetizing. The cheese inside the burger patties tastes cheap and doesn't ooze out or anything. You'd barley even notice. There is nothing special about this burger. Nothing even worth talking  about and therefore I refuse to say anything more about this lousy establishment. 

Save your change, stomach, and gas money. Don't go to Big Moe's"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before but today i just can't help but post a review. 
I placed an order to go and few minutes later my wife asked me to get the milk for the kids heated up. 
I reluctantly asked the staff for assistance. They not only heated up the milk without making a big deal out of it, they prepared awesome burgers."}
{"text":"I thought I can only have funnel cake at CNE until I found Big Moe's Burgers. It is a small take out restaurant but with very good services. My Groupon was expired for a few days but they still allow me to use it. Portion of food is great. I saw a gentleman was having burger there. It looked very good as well. Will definitely go back to try their burgers!!"}
{"text":"Need to add your Yonge Street location to yelp.  Just ate there and it was excellent.  The burger was fresh and well-made, and the poutine was great, though could have used a bit less gravy."}
{"text":"I drive by this place daily. Looks odd for a non-asian place to open up in the middle of north China Town. Got take out. Agree with one review that the workers are not experienced and the service is slow. Took a long time for them to cook the food then it sat there for a good 10 mins before anyone dressed it and packed it up for me. It was cold by the time I ate it. However it was one of the BEST burgers ever. Loved the fresh cut fries. Yes it gets soggy when you pack it up cause there is NO preservatives! but its still awesome. Funnel cake is yum too. Prices reasonable.. Will definitely make this a reg joint for me and my family."}
{"text":"the Jucy lucy is the only good thing about this place if its not dried out...which is always is. Jucy Lucy is typically what i order but this time decided to try something else, so i ordered the hamburger..which surprise was dry and had a hair it. its unfortunate that a halal lace like this has poor quality assurance."}
{"text":"Woooo!!! My girlfriend and I decided to try their funnel cake. Better than we expected!!  An amazing place with real good burgers aswell"}
{"text":"The chicken Juicy Lucy is pretty damn tasty! A bit of a wait though."}
{"text":"Found this place one day when I was hungry for a burger using this new phone AP called FourSquare.  Was I ever glad that I did! 

The Burger that I had was excellent!  This is honestly one of the best burgers I have had in years.  The fries with gravy is slightly above average, however, I wouldn't say extraoridinary.

I really liked the two people behind the counter that worked there.  Not certain if they were the owners or not but, they were smiling, very friendly, personable and each had a good sense of humour.  

The prices were reasonable for what you get... I wouldn't say super cheap or crazy expensive.  It was somewhere in the middle which was nice.  

Good selection of drinks from what I noticed.  

Definitely recommend that you check this place out if you are up in the area. This place is truly a hidden gem in North Scarborough."}
{"text":"Juicy Lucy was usually overcooked by the same cook. The burger did not have cheese oozing out of the patty instead it was dry and crusty. The fries were semi-cooked while others were just tough to chew on (mostly raw potatoes). I have tried their hamburger special where the meat was equivalent to a McDonald's kids burger with regular buns. Needless to say, utterly disappointed but nonetheless there is a yummy sushi restaurant next door to save the day!"}
{"text":"Got Groupon for $10 value. They don't have 8\"  Funnel Cake, but 6\". Taste is good, comes with strawberry sauce but they only have 1 type of ice cream (vanilla). Price is not bad. 
Worth to try if you live uptown, in all season, rather than wait til summer season at Wonderland / CNE.
It might be nice if they serve coffee / tea ~ think about Funnel Cake + Dessert = Nice match !
There's around 4 or 5 small seat facing window. Small but good to enjoy."}
{"text":"Never have I ever seen a bigger discrepancy between two different locations of the same franchise. This location (Kennedy and Steeles) absolutely SUCKS! 
We called 10mins prior to pickup hoping to have the burgers ready when we get there. Upon arrival, the order was ready on time however when we ate it the meat was raw! The burger patty was tasteless and smelled funny, the cheese was not melted and it was clear that the burger was not freshly made. It was a pre-made burger which was packaged and given to us. 
SOOOOOOOO dissapointed in this place because the Lawrence location proved to be really good. 
Unfortunately because of 1 location entire franchise is now blacklisted in my books. I'm really afraid I'm going to be sick tomorrow because of the burger I ate."}
{"text":"It's a small burger place but amazing burgers especially the triple b and the juicy lucy. The prices are very good for the burgers they make. I would totally recommend this place to people that love burgers."}
{"text":"I was suprised!  The burger tasted really good and so was the funnel cake.  It was similar to a whopper but the meat tasted way better.  I don't know how they make money in that Chinese area but hell there were people in there when I visited.

The only complain is service can be a little bit faster."}
{"text":"Everything freshly made, kind of pricey...
and the funnel cake was 'ok' but i think Wonderland ones much better."}
{"text":"The main reason that I went to big moes was for funnel cake. The funnel cake was perfect! It was so good and I couldn't stop eating it. We also ordered the juicy Lucy, and Poutine. The burger was good, I the Poutine on the other hand was mushy and had no taste."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I enter the place to see 3 teenagers running the show and seem to be clueless. it took them 23 minutes to make me two burgers and a funnel cake in addition to another customer's order only. I walked out with two bags and drinks and when got home was shocked to see how the fries was dripping oil and almost dark brown (due to old oil).. the funnel cake is missing... Nothing juicy about the burger and I am feeling sick after trying to eat some of the food. 
I really wonder if the people who highly rated this place are owners or friends of owners or it was under a complete different management! other wise these people should be banned from rating! 

If you don't believe the above be my guest and pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Tbh, I don't get the huge hype here - I've been told by my friends that it's all about the daily special deals.  By far, they say, the best deal is Juicy Lucy day. 

Based on taste alone, they are better than your average burger chain (you know the one, the Canadian chain that used to boast charcoal grills?) but if sticking to another somewhat similarly priced food-court that craftily serves up burgers, I prefer the latter.  

On the plus side, there aren't that many burger joints in that part of Scarborough and the prices are reasonable enough.  They're also super fast with orders, so dropping by for a quick fix is literally just that."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here and I wasn't really impressed. No denying it was a juicy burger but the rest was pretty much what I would get in macdonalds. I think 30 dollars for two burgers are a little bit excessive to be honest. There was a lot of poutine but nothing special at all. Don't think u would bother coming back."}
{"text":"so I've been here before because their juicy Lucy chicken burger is all I kept hearing about and it was good. 

I've never had a chicken burger infused with cheese so I enjoyed it but I wasn't oh-em-gee about it.

I'm a little prissy, so the burger was a little messy for my liking, however very flavourful.

I actually came for the funnel cake my most recent visit. I truly enjoyed it. the only thing I wished they had was soft serve ice cream. that would definitely put it on top of the ones from wonderland. I'd say the trek here would be worth it for the funnel cake."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend based on the rating on the stars. I ordered the cheese burger w a poutine. 

When I got my order, the bun was still cold and the patty was quite thin with not much taste. My boyfriend ordered just a regular hamburger and his bun was also cold.     

The fries for the poutine was soft, not crispy at all and my boyfriend said he actually ate a raw potato. 

Coming from a night of drinking before, food always tastes good the day after but this was a different story. We won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"With a name like Big Moe's you walk in with larger than normal expectations. You expect, big portions, big taste, big value and maybe a big dude behind the counter. Many of these items were not to the scale that I would have hoped but most importantly the flavour was certainly BIG!!

Located on the south-east corner of Kennedy and Steeles (behind the gas station directly across from P-mall), you'll need to maneuver your car quickly or risk missing out on the slightly hidden entrance to the cramped parking lot for Big Moes and 4 other businesses. Pro-tip go one light further east on Steeles, turn right and park in the GoTrain Milliken parking lot - because it's a 2 minutes walk away and the Big Moe's parking lot is a recipe for a fender bender.

The purpoe of my visit was to try the famed Juicy Lucy burger. Now what is that? Well my burger budd, the Juicy Lucy is a burger creation which originates from the Minneapolis-St.Paul area of Minnesota. The concept is that you have a layer of cheese baked into a 5 oz beef pattie. What's especially unique is that Big Moe's is the ONLY place in the GTA or Toronto whipping these up. Verdict? Great tasting beef, fresh, melty cheese, however I wasn't over the moon for it. It was slightly overcooked for my liking and the cheese really didn't stay inside (rather it was leaking through all sides of the burger). Other versions of the JL that I've seen on TV tend to be a larger burger which is able to contain the cheese to it's center - there was nothing inside mine so I was a little disappointed 

Tuesday is Cheeseburger day where you can get a standard Big Moe's cheeseburger (4oz) for a mere $2.50. In speaking with the staff here I learned that they are out the door crazy busy on those nights, with some folks ordering 10-15 burgers at a time. I'm sorry I don't care it they're $0.99, what family or work crew is eating 10-15 burgers at lunch?? Gluttony is one of the 7 deadly sins remember folks... tsk tsk. So with that in mind be advised that wait times will be longer than normal on these days.

Big Moe's used to be famous for their spiral tornado fires but they're no longer available on the menu - sad. What is great is they're still whipping up possibly the finest Funnel Cakes around. Thick and crispy dough base which is soft and warm on the inside, topped with ice cream, powdered sugar and strawberry sauce. So bad for me... but so damn good!!

Overall this place is A-OK, maybe I was there on an off day, but while things were good for the most part I was let down by the burgers construction itself. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"My first Juicy Lucy and it was terrific - cheese on the inside zoweee!!!

Friendly service - lots of topping choices - waffle fries are great. 

Place is small so take out is likely the way to go unless you are fortunate to grab one of the half dozen lunch counter seats. The server tells us its going to be 10 minutes to make the burger, nice to see that there was not a pile of burgers precooked prior to my arrival. I got to see my burger drop on the grill.

Took 1 star away because of the ketchup bottles on the counter have been refilled HUNDREDS of times - really....that's nasty. Replace those plastic bottles and get your 5th star!"}
{"text":"I'm a little ashamed to say that I live 5 minutes away from this place, but didn't notice it until very recently. I was missing out, but they really need to invest in some new signs to make this location more visible. It just kind of disappears behind the gas station and other buildings around it. 
I went here initially because of a groupon for their funnel cake and was impressed with what I saw in terms of their burgers and decided to make the trip back. The funnel cake is pretty awesome too by the way: filling and rich, but we're here for the big show: the burger. 
The juicy lucy seemed like a no brainer (cheese in the middle of the patty) and while it was very good (fresh, juicy, and well made) I was a little let down that it didn't have the punch I thought it would. Maybe it's the seasoning or something, but it's just an OK burger. It looks amazing, just doesn't quite get there on taste. Good, but not great. Also, the cheese in the middle (while sounding awesome) just tends to be messy and for some reason doesn't taste as good as a straight up cheeseburger. I just go for a regular cheeseburger now. 
Prices are reasonable and the fries are good if not that memorable.
Easy delicious choice, but not the best burger joint in town."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews on Yelp I had to try the Juicy Lucy. It was good, but I don't really think that its worth 5stars. Kind of ordinary. Sure there's the novelty of cheese oozing from the burger, but I just wish there was more flavour. Perhaps it can be improved by marinating the meat or adding some spice to the cheese in the middle? I'm no chef so I'm not quite sure how to improve the burger, I just know that there is potential for the Juicy Lucy to be far better than what it is now.

A note of service, the people are nice but they seem incredibly inexperienced in running a business. If my family and I wanted to, we could'vejust left with our burgers without paying, since 1)they never asked us to pay 2) we had to ask 3 times, before they finally remembered to charge us!

So overall I would avoid this place during busy times, b/c frankly I think the joint will be completely in the weeds when facing a big crowd. Choose a quiet day to get a burger ;)"}
{"text":"Place is right near Pacific Mall. Never realized it was there until I used Yelp. The restaurant itself is quite minimal. A quick sit-and-eat setup. 

Ordered the Juicy Lucy. The portions weren't as large as I expected. The bun was acceptable. The patty was moist, and quite tasty. The condiments and toppings all had flavour. The burger wasn't only well presented, it was also structurally solid... not the kind that collapses as you get into it. Overall the burger was great. 

The fries were freshly cut but nothing special. I need to go back to try out their funnel cake.

The service was also good. The staff let me have the fries after the burger for the combo price."}
{"text":"Made the trek from Vaughan to Northern Scarborough to try my first ever, Juicy Lucy Burger with the CMYE Burger Brigade lead by our fierce leader Kris U.! 

Big Moe's location is a little tricky to get to by car, eventually I found the entrance to the parking lot. Accessibility is what gives this place a 4/5 stars.

Ravenously hungry, I tried to delicately open the door as to not startle any one of my fellow Yelpers who had just placed their order and were standing along the window in this standing only venue. 

I ordered the famous Juicy Lucy! I unwrapped the beast and after a quick snapshot, I took a big bite! I was surprised with the hot melted cheese oozing out of the meat patty. Burnt the top of my mouth... My fault completely! Love the concept of this burger!

I also shared the home-cut fries with chili powder - spicey! Thanks Allison Y. And dabbled a little into the gravy covered, cheesy goodness of Kris U.'s Poutine, Thanks!

Now that alone was enough to satisfy this girl, but wait... Of course... I'm getting to know our CM well now! Kris U. ordered us some funnel cakes! Topped with strawberry ice cream and strawberry sauce! OMG!!!! Never tried them before in my life... But after my first bite I felt a little bit of euphoria. That delicious...Mmmm! Was true love in a styrofoam container! Never has my heart felt so much warmth by something so delicious! Cold, warm, chewy, crispy, sweet, creamy, strawberries! Oh my! My life has been changed! 

My first Burger Brigade meet was a success! Although, I think this time the dessert stole the show for me. Thanks to our CM and Big Moe's!! Until next time friends....:)"}
{"text":"Hey kids!
Went to Moe's for lunch today... and I loved it!
A colleague & I each ordered a cheeseburger & fries, plus we also split a Twister-Dog, just because it was criminal to not try one. (see photos).

To my taste, a great burger, very similar in style and intent to The Burger's Priest, with a fresh-ground beef ball pressed into a patty on the grill-top, with grilled onions and toppings of my choice, all on a soft, toasted bun - and frankly, they pull it off quite well.  Add my order of nicely browned 1/4\" fresh-cut fries and I'm good-to-go!

Overall, I'd score Moe's slightly AHEAD of 5-Guys for flavour of the beef, cheese, and bun, with slightly thinner fries that I like better than 5-Guys, as well.  

When comparing Big Moe's to Burger's Priest, it's very close on all counts!  I like the meatiness of Moe's burger a little better - seemed slightly less fatty and held together a little better, but I'd give a slight edge to the Priest on the intensity of beefy flavour of the beef, but I liked Moe's toasted bun slightly better (very similar), plus Burger's Priest edges Moe's for flavour of the fries, even if BP's do tend to be pale and inconsistent.  All in all, slightly behind BP, but based on just one trip so far, a very solid effort!

The Twister-Dog was fun and silly, with a spiral-cut whole russet potato surrounding a foot-long dog on a stick, like Saturn's rings, (see photos) Fun, but nothing special, to my taste.  The place is also very minimalist, with a counter and some stools only.

All-in-all, a solid job by Moe's, plus it's halal for those who care, and they tell me that a secret-burger menu is coming too, so let the fun begin!  I'll be back.

Cheers,
.James."}
{"text":"I've only tried the Juicy Lucy burger and the fries, the tornado potato, and the funnel cake.

I'll start with the good: THE BURGER IS AMAZING! It almost made me give this place five stars, but there are some issues that I would like the store to address. The fries and the tornado potato were just not good. I'm not sure how they can make a legendary burger but mess up deep frying something.

I would honestly love to get your combos and give you more money because I can see that the fries are FRESH CUT! But you're just not deep frying them correctly! They don't even taste like potato fries anymore, all I can taste is the oil. And sometimes they're burnt.

The funnel cakes are great! The strawberry topping is just strawberry jam. I was disappointed by this at first, but when I actually took a bite all of the flavours came together wonderfully.

The burger... Oh dear god the burger. I can no longer be satisfied with a burger unless it has cheese spilling out of it. I literally only go to this place if I need my burger fix, nowhere else. I would recommend going to this place at least once to try their Juicy Lucy burger.

All in all, I like the place. I just personally stay away from the fries."}
{"text":"I love this place. I think the burgers are very good and fries are good as well. I have never been disappointed with my order. Juicy Lucy beef is my favorite, although I will have to try the triple one of these times. Usually gets a funnel cake for dessert. Ultimately it is best to come and try for yourself. I cannot tell you how many times I wished I ignored the negative review of some place I wanted to try. I still read review but always choose for myself. I think the review that tell you to absolutely stay away usually have a motive behind the negative review."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef burger, a juicy lucy and a poutine.

The meat is pretty good, you can tell it is fresh but I found it to be underseasoned on both burgers.

The bread is pretty plain..and white. But tastes alright. 

Poutine is seriously lacking flavour. Salt was a necessity. The fries are unseasoned, the gravy is tasteless and mozzarella was used instead of cheese curds (thumbs down).

Meal was about 20$ 

I'm on the fence if I'd come back. Staff were friendly."}
{"text":"If you've ever watched Man Vs Food, they had an episode on the creation of the Jucy (or Juicy) Lucy and the battle of the founders in Minneapolis.

The Jucy Lucy is basically a burger stuffed with cheese.  I remember watching it and thinking piping hot cheese squirting out of meat when you take a bite might not be a good idea, but meh, what do I know.

Wouldn't you know it, we accidentally discovered this place and whaddaya know, they have the Juicy Lucy!  What the hey right?  Wouldn't you know it... I forgot about my own cautionary thoughts when I watched that episode, took a big bite, and out squirted the molten lava cheese, giving me a decent lip burn.

The burger was ok, but now that I've had it, I think a burger with Cheese Wiz or nacho sauce put right on it might be as good or better, without the burn.

The fries were a bit soggy.. probably an indicator of old oil.

Overall.. it was aight."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and the guy at the counter didn't even want to serve us as soon as he saw the groupon in my friend's hand. The moment he saw it, his smile went away. If they don't want to take groupons then they shouldn't participate in the program. He was so sarcastic when he talked and his facial expressions were so rude; rolling his eyes and giving attitude. If my friend didn't have the groupon we wouldn't have even gone here to eat. Ridiculous.

They need to renovation this place because it's so small and disgusting. They Only have one long table along the window with about 7 seats. If you plan on dining in, don't."}
{"text":"Big Moe's is absolutely key. Their veggie burger is unbelievable (tastes a little bit like a homemade felafel patty? Regardless, it's made to order and delicious), and the poutine is just as good (available in meat gravy or mushroom)

My recommendation: order ahead. The only reason these guys don't have 5 stars is they're intensely disorganized, and it takes forever to get your order (like...15-20 minutes). Not a problem, because its worth it, but if you don't call ahead you'll regret it.

GO TRY MOE'S!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars

I'm a fan of the Big Moe's franchise, particularly the location by Yonge and Gerrard, and was very excited to find out that there was a Markham location!  The [halal] burgers were great, as expected.  On the the other hand, the same could not be said about the service.  

The woman working cash, and the man the at the grill, looked d-o-n-e.  Totally understandable, it's not an easy job by any means, and who knows how long they'd be clocked in?  However, it was a VERY stark contrast to the consistent service I receive from the downtown location.

But if all you want is a burger in the Markham area - you should come here!"}
{"text":"I would have given this a three start if it was cheaper. It really was pretty mundane. The patty was so thin, maybe thinner that Mcdonald's. It had the crisp sear on the outside but there was just so little meat in between that you really couldn't get any flavour out of it. I thought the toppings and sauces were pretty standard and were what brought proper flavouring into it. I wasn't a big fan of the bun though. It was like a bread roll and wasn't meant to hold anything between it. it was soggy from the sauces towards the end but stale towards the top. It basically made up 50% of the burger. Also, it bit cold too because they didn't warm it up enough. I wasn't too please but I wasn't terribly disappointed either."}
{"text":"I did not really like the burger but it's important to note that I did not get the Juicy Lucy and I just got a regular burger.  The patty was dry and didn't have much flavour BUT (here we go) THE FUNNEL CAKE OMG it will change your life it is so good.  The ice cream that you can add is alright BUT if you want to really bring the flavour home, go to McDonald's and top it off with the soft serve.  If eating this doesn't bring a tear to your eye (and a clog to your arteries), I don't know what will.  The fries are also pretty darn good.  

I would go back for the funnel cake and the fries for sure without a doubt."}
{"text":"So I'm walking home from Pacific Mall around 8pm tonight and I stumble upon this burger joint called Big Moe's Burgers on the S/E corner of Kennedy and Steeles, just below the Petro Canada gas station. Somewhere on there signage it says they use fresh grinded ground beef or something along those lines. So, if your familiar with the area it sticks out like a sore thumb because all the business in that particular area are chinese. So I go in and decide to give it a try.

Here is my review:

I order a burger with fries and a drink ($4.79 for the burger and $2.99 to make it a combo).

Surprisingly the burger was quite good, nicely seasoned, pretty juicy and a nice soft bun. I use Burger Priest as my measuring stick for burgers. If Burger Priest is a 9.5/10, Big Moe's is at least a 7.5/10. The reason for the point differential is because Burger Priest has a slightly juicier burger and I asked Big Moe himself why he doesn't cook the burger a little bit more rare and he indicated it was because of the demographics of the area and it's not something they might be accustomed to but I'm sure if you ask, he would accommodate you.

They also have veggie burgers on their menu, the girl sitting next to me at the counter ordered it and I quietly asked her of what she thought of the veggie burger and she said she really enjoyed it.

The fries were pretty good too, fresh cut fries that were nicely salted.

In addition the places also sells funnel cakes oddly enough, didn't try it though.

The owner Moe indicated that they just opened last Saturday. Normally my first option would be Burger Priest but since I live near Pacific Mall, I think this place is a great option for people that live in upper Scarborough that want a good gourmet burger and don't want to make the trek to the beaches."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I want to vomit right now. My burger (Juicy Lucy) was so dry and not seasoned. The patty tasted so gross. They only take cash and have an ATM inside that charges you a 1.85 service fee. I had a positive experience a long time ago,  but not anymore. Go to the Warden and Lawrence location. You can only enter the parking lot while going North on Kennedy Rd,  just before Steeles Ave."}
{"text":"Love the \"Juicy Lucy\" Get it at least Once a week on the way home from work. I get it with the tornado Fries as a Combo, definitely fill me up. The Juicy Lucy has cheese inside the patty, and comes on a bun perfectly sized for the meat.  The guy there told me they have all their ingredients especially sourced and delivered regularly, so every time i go their i know i will be gettin. Like the bun will always be the same size taste texture,becaus they have it especailly baked for them at a bakery. Alot of other scarbrough burger joints need to learn consistancy from this place. 

the tornado fires is hard to explain its like a potato made into sprils chips on a stick. If only i had a pic to show you. 

ohh man im getting hungry."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today. I had the Juicy Lucy (cheese inside the burger) and the Tornado Potato. Both were good. The burger was tasty but not as good as Burgers Priest, Holy Chuck, or Five Guys in my opinion but still really good and made from fresh ground meat. The tornado potato is neat and there are several seasonings to try. I just had my potato with plain salt. I would totally recommend trying this place they are friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"Cheese inside the burger ..... Genius 

Great juicy burgers and fantastic poutine with rich tasty gravy and cheese curds with plenty of flavour 

Great burgers and great prices"}
{"text":"After months and months of my friend's bickering, I've finally succumb to her. I'm so glad I did because the Juicy Lucy is the best burger I've ever had. I am currently craving for another one. I also bought a poutine with my order but the poutine was not that good. That would be the only reason why I gave a 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5. The owners (I assume) was incredibility friendly and asked if this was my first time here."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when it was still fairly new and always crowded.. but nowadays whenever I pass by, it seemed like the place is always empty.

They only accept cash? That really sucks.

Service here isn't as friendly. There is a long wait time for food. And the price is expensive for a tiny burger. Food is unremarkable.

Though they are under the same franchise, I still prefer their store at Lawrence and Warden as at least the service there is better.

Or do yourselves a favor and go to Burger Priest instead, since you are pretty much paying for a $10 burger anyways.

{"text":"I came here the other evening for a late take out dinner.  I drove past this place a few times and I had always wanted to check this place out.  

For me and my fiancee, we ordered the double beef burger, double cheeseburger, and poutine.  The burgers were all right.  The beef was to my liking.  But for its price I felt it was a bit expensive.  The poutine had generous portions which I am happy about.  The one downside to their poutine is I felt the cheese curds were thinly cut so there wasn't a lot.  The fries I felt was either undercooked or just didn't have that crunchy taste.  

Overall, the food was only satisfactory.  I may come back again for their daily specials."}
{"text":"Solid burger but doesn't stand up to the best burger joints in the city.  Big Moe's is better than average and worth a try."}
{"text":"I only came here for their Funnel Cakes, although they are known for the burgers which I will have to make a second trip, and review. 
Lets just say, for $10 this place wont cheap out on anything.  Their portions for funnel cakes are enough to serve two people......simply goodness...but I shall check back in and give you my scoop on how their burgesas turn out ;) keep you posted folks"}
{"text":"I drove past this place maybe about a month ago, and I thought to myself, I gotta try this place! Finally I dropped by yesterday for lunch and it was not of disappointment.

I ordered a simple cheese burger, it's so juicy! I can't imagine what the Juicy Lucy tastes like. The beef patty is also halal meat! Homemade beef patties! I can't wait to try their funnel cakes. 

I was a bit disappointed with the fries, I got takeout, so maybe that is why they got soggy. 

There is not much parking in the lot, so you may want to avoid prime times."}
{"text":"I love funnel cakes and Big Moe's Burgers definitely did not disappoint me. Can't say anything about their burgers, fries, etc., though, because I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Great burger place. Only burger place I liked in this area, or else I will have to go up to hwy 7 Tom's burger, south east to Real McCoy or south west to Johnny's. 
I ordered the normal combo but upgraded to poutine and finished off with the funnel cake.....how did I survive all that?
The funnel cake is hot and fresh, the only downside is that they only use strawberry jam other than real strawberries, but still taste good."}
{"text":"This is a Halal burger joint so don't expect to find bacon.  For a bacon lover like myself, I need my bacon on my burgers.  So I probably won't go back for burgers but I would definitely go back for funnel cakes.  They are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  It's perfectly made.  The only thing that might turn me away from the funnel cake is trying to find parking there."}
{"text":"Scummy ownership that limits the items you can use a Groupon on despite not listing that as a purchase condition."}
{"text":"Meh.

I'm a burger lover so after reading a few reviews decided to check this place out.

Went yesterday just past noon and was one of two people in the place so the wait wasn't too bad considering.  Ordered a cheeseburger combo with everything on the burger, fries and coke.

Food was fresh but overall rather bland.  First bite impression was that the meat flavour was bland and burger over-cooked and dry. Personally I think the burger would be far juicier and tastier if cooked medium rather than well.  Bun was soft and toppings ample although I'm not sure if both mayo and 1000 island dressing were necessary.

Second bite was the fries and although fresh cut and golden brown, they were undercooked.

This place has potential if done right but for now it's just....meh."}
{"text":"Boston cream doughnuts are good cuz they're loaded w/ cream and covered w/ chocolate. The Juicy Lucy is good cuz it's meat loaded w/ gooey cheese. It's basically an awesome doughnut burger. And you can order it w/ poutine that is covered in salty, beefy gravy and basically perfect if you're drunk, like salty food, or hungry as a mofo. Portions are generous and service is friendly."}
{"text":"I know the quality of the burger fluctuates because the workers work in shifts.  So depending on the workers you get, you can get an overcooked burger or a wonderful, juicy, big hamburger like the one I have gotten.  The one I got on a Saturday noon easily bested the South St. Burger's.  I felt full all the way till dinner time.  

The Big Moe burger shows me why people love a good burger joint. 

Con: It took about 20 minutes for the order to cook.  Have patience.

I take out 1 star due to inconsistent quality.  If the store can fix this, this is easily a 4-star burger joint, in Scarborough, Markham or the whole GTA."}
{"text":"Enyoyed the burger and the waffle fries and the sauce they came with were really good. A little hard to find  and pretty much take out only, but if in the area worth a stop."}
{"text":"The Juicy Lucy is fantastic.  Not the best burger you will ever eat, but not a far cry from it either. It is griddle cooked very slowly, with cheese in the middle of the patty. A simple burger that tastes great. 

However, I'd recommend 2 things:

1) order the burger by phone in advance as it can easily take them 15 minutes to get it ready.  A big frustration, easily avoided. 

2) eat the burger straight away when it's fresh off the griddle. I wouldn't take-out, as the cheese will dry up quickly. 

With regard to the potatoes, I am personally a big fan of the Tornado. I know many people don't like it, but I think it's great with a little sour cream. 

I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came to this place expecting an awesome burger but ended up like the funnel cake more than the burger. The funnel cake was really good but it doesn't beat the ones at wonderland. Its nice to know that funnel cake is around the corner if you have a craving for it."}
{"text":"Rude middle aged man behind the counter (Owner/Employee not sure) makes the service at McDonald's / Wendy's seem like that of a five star fine dining establishment.

Burger specials have 3 topping stipulation even though it is not state on any where on the menu or posters / signs

Burgers are decent... nothing spectacular. The bun to meat ratio is skewed heavily towards the bun side, but they are cheap on the special days.

Big Moe's you get what you pay for. Bad attitude, no toppings, and a lot of bun."}
{"text":"This is a nice greasy burger joint. Not hip, not healthy, not fancy, and not gourmet. 

That aside, despite the grease factor, it's very juicy and tasty. They make the burger to order so you can see them with the patty being formed by hand and then throwing it on the grill. Since it's made to order, expect a 5-10 minute wait for your burger to be ready. Okay, more like 10. But it's okay you can chat with the guys behind the counter if there's no lineup behind you. They are super friendly.. The fries are pretty good too. I wasn't going to order any but then I saw someone else's order of fries and they look so fresh and golden that I wanted some too. Bad idea. i ended up eating the whole thing all  by myself. I didn't want to share with anybody :P"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the burgers are awful. When you order the burgers they open up a little freezer and throw the frozen patty on the grill. The staff is dressed in street clothes and it seems like they hired bums off the street to work in the kitchen. The decor is from the 60s. This place is disgusting, I can't believe that the health department hasn't shut it down"}
{"text":"Vegatables weren't fresh, undercooked meat, and had a bad after taste of rot. Also fries were under cooked, the poutine gravy was also runny. It's sad I can't say one positive thing"}
{"text":"Good burgers , fresh cut fries and friendly staff ... much needed in that area of Scarborough"}
{"text":"Walked in to try their Juicy Lucy Burger which is combo 1.  It's a 5oz patty with cheese inside the patty.

The burger was priced at $5.99..

Would have preferred a 8oz size burger, I'm a beef guy and 4oz to 5oz just doesn't do it for me. Asked about a making it a double Juicy Lucy but he said because the cheese is already built in, it doesn't taste good.

Overall the patty tasted ok.. But it was just too small, tasted home-made, fresh, 100% beef. So $5.99 for a cheese burger is not bad for value.  However, I think they should definitely put a bigger size patty option for their signature burger.. Also considering this place is called Big Moe's Burger.. You expect big..

The chef did heat up the bun and it was slightly toasted, but the bun was cold, thick, over-powered the beef, so it ruined the burger for me for.

Would come back and try a different burger, maybe the double cheese burger with additional beef strips.. Hopefully I can bump up the rating to a 3 star joint.."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Juicy Lucy Poutine combo. First, my burger... I had to look a few times after I've taken a bit, because I thought I was eating a fish burger. It's the first time I've eaten a chicken burger where the chicken is not dry; I love their signature sauce, which is Thousand Island...which is not fair as it is my favourite regardless. I've seen others complained about it...to be honest, if that's not your \"thing\", there are three other choices, don't complain about you choosing the wrong sauce. 
Now, I have also seen someone complained about their fries. Undercooked FRESH fries will be crunchy; undercooked FROZEN fries will powdery. Their fries? I feel like they use fresh cut fries soaked in water before being fried. You know, like New York Fries. 
Their portion is generous enough, and the lady, maybe because it was slow as it was early, I felt like a VIP. Next: try their funnel cake."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3-4 times hoping it'll get better. The most memorable aspect of Big Moe's is that their fries are ALWAYS undercooked. Who prefers their french fries undercooked? When ordering poutine, I've had to specifically ask if they could be cooked longer, but they still turn out undercooked. What a shame.

The sauce they put on their cheeseburgers just isn't to my taste. It's like a pseudo Big Mac sauce."}
{"text":"Big Moe's Halal burger was not a blessing at all, in fact it's only glorified carny food, something you would find on the midway at the CNE.
They could of used a better bun for their burgers, instead they use bottom grade grocery store buns saturated in corn meal. (Gross)."}
{"text":"I tried the Juicy Lucy and there was no juice by the time they finished overcooking it.  I saw the burgers coming apart on the grill as they keep pressing them.  There are other and better halal options like Hero Burger."}
{"text":"If you're a girl and cute, you may just get a free burger. Just saying! But seriously good burgers and the poutine is dope! Not really a sit down place but there are counters to eat from."}
{"text":"Just had to get a juicy halal burger - without any options in Whitby, we made a beeline for Kennedy and Steeles to try Moes.

Overall the burgers were pretty good - and the best halal burger you will likely find that at least comes close to gourmet style downtown Toronto (priest, P&L, etc)

Poutine was pretty good as well.

I wouldn't go beyond a 3 star though for the following reasons 

- poor location with horrible parking - it's jammed in an alleyway strip mall beside a Petro can and really hard to back out of spot.  Also a sketchy massage place attached.  
- bad or limited seating - not good for family unless nobody is there - it's only 6 seats looking out the window to Petro Can with high top counter.

- service not great - we met the owner he didn't seem to be super happy, he did ask us how we liked everything but not really friendly - we had a family of 4 with a small child and nobody else was there - would have been nice to come out and help me with the food bringing it over.
- burgers were ok - flavour wasn't amazing but again they were decent.  The buns are way too big compared to the size of patty - smaller buns are needed. 
- only single washroom - who doesn't love sharing a male / female toilet situation right ? 

Anyway that's it for now - if this place was 5 mins from me I would absolutely go back but not worth the long drive - if you have to eat halal would Sooner choose another option or something different."}
{"text":"Best burger place I've ever had they put the cheese in the middle of the patty sooo good. They also use halal meat maybe this is why the burger tasted better then any other I've had and I have had so many lol."}
{"text":"Bought groupon voucher. Was greeted with a pissed off middle aged woman who appears to be a family member. Was irritated every time someone came in to order. Burgers are small and expensive. Funnel cake...yummy. Would rather go to Lick's."}
{"text":"The juicy Lucy is a must try!  Freshly grounded beef stuffed with cheese,  grilled until it melts!  Toppings for selection is very limited,  and it's too cold to dine in during the Winter."}
{"text":"A new halal burger takeout joint in Scarborough, in the land where Asian food rules!!

While I still in bed thinking \"What Should I Eat\" for lunch, my Yelp Friend messaged me about Big Moe's  Burgers \"Pay What You Want\" Grand Opening Specials! Now I know where I will be going for lunch!

Big Moe's is located just south of Pacific Mall (Asian food is calling my name!) in the strip mall next to Petro Canada.

So the deal is I suppose to eat either a Hamburger ($4.79) or a Cheeseburger ($5.79) and pay them what I think its worth. So I am thinking should I pray that it is so tasty or it is so crappy so I don't pay at all?

Big Moe's has the similar concept like Burger Priest, fresh grounded beef patties with no fillers and pan fried on a flat grill. Should I feel good about this or not?! As I am not a big fan of Burger Priest!

The burger turned out tasted so delicious and quite sizable compare to Burger Priest. The complains I have would be that my beef patty was a little overcook and it was flattened too much and most of the meat juice got squeezed out!

I saw that Big Moe's offers Funnel Cake and I decided to give it a try. But disappointingly their funnel cakes are not good.

6\" Funnel Cake with a touch of Icing Sugar ($3.99) was one of the worst one I had. The cook admit that she has not master the skills as my cake had all the dough stuck together while it was frying.... sigh.. I want Wonderland Funnel Cake!!

The staffs here really care about the customers and their products and hopefully in time everything would be prepare the way it suppose to be!"}
{"text":"They do not allow you to change/add toppings for the Tuesday cheeseburger special.. which has lettuce, ketchup and mayo. That is utterly retarded."}
{"text":"Another great burger joint!! 
The reason why their food is so great here at Big Moe's is because they use fresh ingredients, nothing frozen. Everything is prepared right in front of you. The quality of the food is top notch, great food. The Juicy Lucy burger is fantastic, if your reading this review and end up at Big Moe's please do try the Juicy Lucy. If the Juicy Lucy burger is getting all this praise, there is no need for me to mention the cheese burger or the hamburgers because those are simply awesome as well. Their fries are cut fresh in front of you and definitely complement the burger.

Regarding the Tornado Fries, I don't think there is another place nearby that does have this unique twist to a potato. I think I have only seen these at the exhibition place. The tornado fries are great and there is a variety of toppings that you can top it off with which makes the experience here better. 

Finally, I would love to complement the lovely staff who are friendly and keen to make your experience at Big Moe's an enjoyable one. 

Do try Big Moe's!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about some good reviews about this place i finally went to try after finding a groupon deal online as well. I ordered the Juicy Lucy burger, Double Cheeseburger and fries. I didnt like the juicy lucy so much. There isnt a lot of cheese inside and there wasnt anything special about it. However, i thought the double cheeseburger was pretty good. The meat is juicy, bread was soft and the fries were oily but good. It is a little on the pricey side and It did take about 15mins to get my food but the workers were nice and friendly. I told them it was my first time and they offered to give me a free drink which was a nice gesture. What i dont like is that parking is limited and small as well as the joint itself. I think overall it's ok and i would go back occasionally"}
{"text":"Simple burger joint with some wobbly chairs by a long table in front of the window. It looked decently clean and the person working was very nice. Asked if he could change the TV channel and he found the basketball game.

Presentation wise of the burger was simple, served on a checker parchment paper. Pretty standard burger, the bun held its shape and all the fillings. Felt like the beef patty tasted a bit weird and the texture was a little dry. The thousand island sauce was barely noticeable, over powered by the actual pickles. The portion of the poutine was very generous, however it was lacking on the cheese. Whatever cheese there was on it, it was melty and stretched all the way to the sky. The gravy was the standard beef gravy, nothing new. Too bad the fries were a little underdone, can still feel the raw texture of potato in each bite.

Overall, too many other burger joints around. Don't think there will be another visit unless there are some improvements."}
