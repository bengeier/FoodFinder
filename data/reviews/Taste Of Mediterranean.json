{"text":"If u have been to one of the food court locations for this franchise, u won't be disappointed.  They have just everything on the menu, with better service, seating, and much much more quieter."}
{"text":"Good food to grab a quick lunch or get delivered. Apparently We went after the lunch rush so they were running out, but the girl working there tried to substitute with other things as much as she could. Its not fancy but if u're hungry, it'll do. I got chicken shwarma on pita and husband got beef platter. Both tasted pretty decent."}
{"text":"Taste of Mediterranean keeps on amazing me with the great food and service. Big portions, great flavors. Will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"A new place in College Park, and worth a visit.  The staff is friendly and prices are fairly reasonable.  Some of the food is a bit greasy, but it all tastes pretty good anyway.

I wouldn't eat here every day (or week) but I will be back.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around 2pm with Groupon.

Small industrial/plaza type of place with 5-6 tables and an order/takeout style setup.  Salad was good, chicken soulvaki was good, gyro good, chicken leg not so great. But portions were really small  - roughly $9-10 for a plate.  The plate is very small...a small styrafoam plate. We ended up ordering a 3rd dish between 2 people.  If their portions were upped just a bit I would go back."}
{"text":"The service was as bad as the server's personality. High prices and not worth it. Would not go if I didn't have a coupon. Food was alright, but simply not worth the price I would usually pay l. The owner demanded tip after we were finished eating. Would not come back"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch yesterday with my friend.  Staff was very  friendly and food was amazing for the price. I tried chicken shwarma platter and my friend had a Souvlaki sandwich.Good portion of salad in platter. Will surely refer to my friends"}
{"text":"This was a great meal. We walked in here at midnight after a concert expecting to find some adequate food to satiate a missed dinner. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty, the staff very helpful, and friendly. The Falafel was hot and fresh, and tasted just as good as it would in a sit-in, fancy mediterranean restaurants. The pitas were fluffy, and fresh, as were the staff who did a great job cheering up our tired group, and understanding and carefully addressing the food allergies we had in our group.

Definitely worth a visit, not just for a midnight meal, but for anytime you want a great mediterranean dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place and wanted to give it a try!

Salty. Very salty.
I got the three salads and meat option.
The price was good and the portion size fair.
There are limited choices of salad.
Additionally, the chicken was dark meat, greasy, and overall, just not a great experience. :("}
{"text":"OMG what I mistake to have dinner there 
I went after I done my school I was really hungry so I went there  I never seen more dirty and missy Resturant like this even the food look so bad but I said let me buy falafel was dry and service very poor"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff each time I go.  Place is clean from what I see.  Been here 4 times and always hit the spot.  Gyros is very good here and the tomato flavor rice is nice.  Taste of Mediterranean is a nice spot in the area filled with all those pizza joints.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Would give it 3.5 stars but I'll round up because the service was great. Went there for greek souvlaki for lunch but felt like a shawarma. It was tasty and filling. A little messy to eat but it decent flavour and toppings. And for $9 total you also got a drink. Would go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine from school recommended me this place, so i decided to visit. The decor is very odd and messy, the tables were greasy with dried rice on the chairs and dried sauce stains on the chair as well. The people that were working there was very rude. So i decided to get the student deal, since it seems like a good deal.
In the student deal you get a quarter piece chicken, rice and potatoes. The chicken was dry, the rice is bland and potatoes were decent.  The price for this dish was $4.99. Pretty much you get what you paid for. Not worth it. Better try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch.

The food: 
Love their quarter chicken. The potatoes are super flavorful and delicious.  However, the shishkabob is under cooked and dry. All the food BUT the shishkabob is pretty good.

The owner/manager is really nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Wowow! Definitely one of the best Mediterranean  fast food walking places! 

The food is so flavourful and done right! You get quiet a bit for the $ you pay.

Place is clean, and nice. The staff is super nice as well!!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for $23 for a four person meal.  After several attempts, we finally were able to use our Groupon on the very last day.  Let's say that you get what you paid for.   The portions of meat were minuscule.   We also got some rice and salad.   I wouldn't pay regular price for food at this restaurant.   We also tried to call several times to ask about their hours, but no one ever picks up.   We tried going another time to use our Groupon, but were told that they had run out of food.."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant is a new addition to the bustle of the College Park building. The menu is a fusion of Greek and Middle Eastern cuisines, serving up both souvlaki and shawarma with other usual staples including Greek salad and falafel. 

I had the chicken schawarma, which was subpar in my opinion. Instead of the usual thinly sliced red onion and tomato pieces served in the wraps, the Greek salad toppings - big chunks of green pepper, tomato, and onion - were thrown into the wrap. My wrap was also finished off with a Greek salad dressing. If I wanted souvlaki, I would have ordered it. The employees also seemed to throw everything into the wrap without asking, and couldn't hear the customers requesting that things be omitted. 

While I like the idea of serving up two cuisines, mixing ingredients into both does not seem to make for a good end product. I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Terrible food. The Shawarma was falling apart and they didn't add in the sauce in my wrap. Wtf"}
{"text":"The St. Lawrence Market is closed on Mondays, and so I have to resort to other lunch options.  A short walk from the market I stumbled across Taste of Mediterranean and it's $4.99 quarter chicken dinner with rice and potatoes sounded pretty good.  Well it wasn't.

The chicken was dry, as it had been sitting in a heated tray for awhile, and the rice was bland and boring.  You really do pay for what you get."}
{"text":"Good price for the 1/4 chicken special.  The food is tasty. But lots of carbs. The chicken skin is flavourful and crispy and the meat is tender.  Very good value"}
{"text":"Here is one sentence: Snack size for a full meal price.

I walked in since my usual greek place in the area is closed for renovations. This seemed new and hip (and recently opened).

The staff were very friendly, asking me if they could help me. They suggested the special, at $7.99 + tax, it was a greek salad plus any type of meat.

I have a decent appetite, for me, that was a starter size. The other place I go, this portion would have been half of theirs (and the prices would have been the same).

They do have nicer containers, not styrofoam but plastic that you could reuse. But so not worth it. There wasn't even a lot of chicken shwarma on it... 

Sorry, that will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Terrible and unsanitary. The server was not wearing gloves and served falafel by hand right after checking out another customer. Base of the Greek salad = iceberg lettuce. Shwarma and souvlaki are dried up and tasteless. Pita is a joke - no pocket, just white unleavened bread. Platters have a few shreds of meat, one scoop of rice, 2 pieces of potato, salad - not worth $11! Never coming back."}
{"text":"This franchised resto is located around the corner from my office so I find myself popping in every once in a while for a bite. My personal go to item on the menu is the beef gyro. It never disappoints me, and is one fat menu item. Their ingredients are good, i.e. your salad will not be wilting and your meat will not be tough. 

This location is a quiet one, never more than a few people at most in here when I walk through the doors. The owner is very nice and it's pretty evident that he works hard at what he does.

Other than the beef gyro, I've had chicken gyro, chicken salad, and I've had a couple of the plates on the menu, which have all been great. My fav is still the beef gyro but then again I'm a sucker for a good meaty sandwich-ish meal. I also like that they have their own branded water bottles. Sure I have no idea how it compares to the regular Nestle, Dasani or Aquafina, but it's nice to see a small business value their brand.

Great location, high quality ingredients, low prices and excellent service keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Don't.....just don't. My friend and I went in for lunch as we were craving falafel. She had a falafel on a pita which was not wrapped properly and completely fell apart. I only wanted a few falafel balls on there own(usually $.25 at every falafel place) and some tzatziki with a tabouleh salad. They did not have tabouleh so i opted for the side potatoes. My meal cost $7.00!!!! $.75 per falafel ball, $.75 for the tzatziki and $3.99 for the side potatoes! The falafels were not that good(very oily) and the potatoes had a weird spice in them......not work the money at all. This is a never to be repeated experience."}
{"text":"Literally the most disgusting food I have every had.  Purchased the Mediterranean platter and Shwarma platter. The white rice was not cooked properly, the beef shwarma was disgusting, I could not finish my meal.  It was dry and gross, I do not understand how the place stays in business or what the others who have rated the establishment of more than 2 stars are thinking.
Save you money and buy ANYTHING else."}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just to warn people about this place. 

I walked into Taste of Mediterranean today for lunch and saw the man behind the counter drop tongs on the floor, pick them up and place them on the counter. No washing, no wiping, no big deal.

This seems suspicious, but I thought \"okay, maybe he's going to wash them later... he just wants to do my order first - obviously not using the floor-tongs.\"

I ordered the quarter chicken, rice, potatoes special as advertised in the window. He picked up the tongs that were JUST on the floor and used them to pick up the piece of chicken from the warming tray. 

That is disgusting and unsafe. 

I can't help but wonder what safety standards he ignores when a customer isn't standing right in front of him. 

I strongly suggest everyone to avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was ok. I got the falafel wrap. It was decent. Wasn't expecting much. Could be better. 

The place really needs some air conditioning though. Couldn't even bare to stand inside."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff and really good food, my favourite to go place. Must go"}
{"text":"It's a solid 3/5. This is a place you would go out of convenience not because there is anything exceptional about the food. 

They use thick pita's for their shawarma's probably due to it being a Mediterranean place which some may or may not like. 

I had the chicken shawarma sandwich to go with all the toppings including garlic sauce and hot sauce. They add a mix of tomato, cucumber and red onion. No pickled turnips unfortunately. 

I would recommend that they separate out the tomato, cucumber and onion as some will like one but not the other. So already the ability to individualize your sandwhich is GONE which is a strike against them for sure. 

It was also exceptionally warm in there when it was a cool night outside (22-24C) so don't expect to eat inside. Not many tables anyways. 

I would only go back if starving and in the area. Their prices are not cheap so you're not getting good value for your money. I'm sure their rent is high so a sandwich costs $8.99 + tax. 

I wish we had shawarmas like the ones in Montreal or Ottawa here!"}
{"text":"Nice enough service - but meh food. That pita bread they use taste like it's from a school cafeteria. Would take a pass - go to Lebanon express or quick pita instead. (I'd give this
A 2.5 out of 5 if I could). You do get a free drink with every order but not sure if that's enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"Also went on a groupon, like Carol said the portions were ridiculous, about $20 worth of food tops.  Potatoes were cold and everything had the same greek salad dressing poured on top.  Some of the food was not too bad but the experience was disappointing.  Food served on thin disposable plates, cutlery was such cheap plastic that it seemed like rubber."}
