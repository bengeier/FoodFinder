{"text":"This place has been taken over by new ownership and no longer offers a buffet.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  It was okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"Tao Yuan aka \"Judy's\" to my son & I who have been coming here for over 6 years. The buffet is small but the food is delicious!  We used to frequent the restaurant at least once a week, now that we have moved farther away we try and stop by once a month. The dumplings that you order off the menu are super yummy! Great food, low price.. who can complain?! Thanks Judy!! :)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this Chinese Restaurant after looking at all the reviews for Chinese Restaurants in the area. Overall, pretty good.   Chicken Egg Foo Young-very different presentation to what I am used to.  3 medium size pancakes, very tasty.  All settled in a base of chicken strips, tons of mushrooms and a savory gravy.  Real good, pancakes light and fluffy.  This one entr√©e and the rice side would be enough for more than 2 people! Sweet and Sour Chicken-again, lightly battered and fluffy coating.  Huge pieces with a better than average sweet sauce.  Could have used a few more vegetables, though. Chix Fried Rice-the usual and good.  Small container, though.  Huge taste, again. We have tried Dragon Express.  That was O.K., but Tao Yuan food has 3 times (3x) the flavor. Cannot speak for other entrees; we only had the two mentioned. Will return and try other entree's."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, yes.  I finally stopped here one night after work because I did not feel like cooking and it is located very close to home.  The restaurant is nothing to look at but the food is delicious, the service is good and the prices are reasonable.  We have returned many times and have never been disappointed.  I have ordered teriyaki chicken, chop suey, chow mein, and various other dishes.  All were good."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Chinese food I've ever forced down.  The server brought out the fried rice first and my first thought was, \"Wow, they used a lot of pepper.\" Well, it wasn't pepper.  It was burnt.  My guess is that they burned something in the wok before they cooked ours and didn't clean it out.  The lo mein was the same way and my wife couldn't eat it.  We had to send it back.  Later that night my wife was in pain from the food.  The price was reasonable for good food but this was anything but.  If I could give less than one star I would."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.  I do not care about the decor.  It is all about the food, how it tastes and in my families opinion it has gotten much better with the new owners.  Great flavors, huge serving sizes and quality ingredients.  It's all about the taste and last night it was wonderful.  I got take out: Cashew chicken, hunan beef, chicken fried rice, and egg rolls.  Yum!   The place was clean, and had plenty of seats.  So what it wasn't newly redecorated. The food is great!  :-)"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I was surprised to see the other rating with one star.  I have been 3 times in the last 2 months- always for lunch and ordered off the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and neat, and our food has always been fresh, hot and yes, \"simple\"- but really good.  You don't feel overly full (take the rest to go) and it's not greasy or heavy.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and such great service !!! Grew up in Jersey and have always missed the East coast authentic Chinese food. This is definitely my new go to place. Great family owned restaurant. Such a wonderful enthusiastic family. Wish them much success  !!"}
{"text":"I placed an order through grubhub for delivery from this restaurant.  15 minutes before my order was to arrive, I received a phone call from a number with a Illinois area code, which I let go to VM.  Upon listening to the VM, I heard a garbled message that I needed to replay at least half a dozen times in order to understand the mumbling on the other end of the line.  I was surprised to realize the messager was telling me that my order was being cancelled because they were short a delivery driver.    I promptly called the restaurant and was informed again that my order was cancelled.  No apology or anything.  Just cancelled.  So here is my warning...if you really want to make sure you have dinner coming when you order it, don't order from this place!!"}
{"text":"I was a little bit scared to eat at this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the chicken egg foo yung and boyfriend got spicy shrimp. The portions were humongous and it was very delicious. The Buffett didn't look very appetizing. I would definitely only order from the dinner menu. Can't wait to go back.  Food is dirt cheap and so delicious."}
{"text":"I had been eaten there since I had vacation in Phoenix,Mesa for 2 weeks. I loved their buffet style chinese foods, very delicious and fresh. The restrurant is clean and service is perfect too. They also provided delivery service to nearby places (with no extra fee). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We are fans of this little local place - but we are not fans of buffets (just our own personal preference).   We order off the menu and usually take it to go and we have never been disappointed.  I get the Buddhist Delight vegetables that comes with rice, their pork fried rice (which has always been very good) and a large wonton soup.  The food is so hot that even when we get it home we still have to let it sit for a few minutes!  I love that.  NIce lady that takes our order and keeps things running. We eat here whenever we are back in Mesa."}
{"text":"We and our family from out of town really enjoyed the food.  Large portions. If you order one plate of each of your favorite 's you can all share.  Diffinently enough for 4 and maybe some to take home.     We will differently be returning."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little restaurant that is under new management. It has just reopened after the previous owners retired. The new owner and staff is personable, helpful and friendly.   The buffet is gone but in its place is a wonderful new menu. Hubby and I each ordered an entree so we could share.  I ordered the house Lo Marin ehich had beef, chicken and shrimp in a tasty peanut sauce, hubby ordered Moo Shoo Pork, both were fabulous and the servings were ample enough that we had lunch the next day.   AND they deliver (within a certain area). We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE....Best Chinese in town!! Portions are huge price is very reasonable Food is SO good...owners are SO great...5 plus stars!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good..very clean ..everthing we've had has been delish..definitely try this restaurant.."}
{"text":"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!! Normally I give fairly kind reviews but this place is AWFUL!!!!!!  If you are diet conscious, eat here! You'll have zero appetite after the first bite.  YUCKY food!!!!!!!!!!  Waitress extremely nice and decent atmosphere but the food truly is inedible!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Greet you at the door service. This Asian cuisine restaurant has plenty of seating and accommodations for children and handicapped. The walls aren't decorated except behind the register. The food makes up for the lack of visuals. The chicken lo mein noodles were amazing, chicken was juicy and the noodles were not extremely oily like you get at other Chinese restaurants. The kung pao chicken was the right amount of spice for those that enjoy spicy food but don't want to sweat all over your meal. The chicken was also just as a juicy as the chicken lo mein. The pupu platter was amazing. Brought out in a sectioned off lazy Susan style dish with a small fire with a grate to keep food warm while eating. Very nice staff as well. I definitely want to come back to this place soon!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch. The place was empty (around 3:30pm). Granted we were in late for lunch. The buffet is small, 15ish items. We tried everything thing they had out and everything was really good. We will definitely be back. Was $16 with drinks for the two of us."}
{"text":"Based on the \"Orange Chicken\" I ordered, I will never order from here again. My order was flavorless, pork was dry and chewy like beef jerky. It was all bad. Everything tastes like oil or soy sauce. The delivery time was extremely fast, but other than that? 1 star."}
{"text":"Now under new ownership and so far things are looking a bit better!  Here are a few observations upon my initial visit during their Grand Opening.  The inside looks the same however, the fried rice and noodles are prepared a bit differently and are a bit better tasting.  The Egg Foo Young is different and is now edible, although it is still too much dough based for my liking, making it less egg omelet like, however there is still brown gravy to cover it, if you so desire.  A couple of items are a bit spicier and more flavorful such as the Pepper Beef and Broccoli Beef as well as the Kung Pao Chicken.    The overall food quality is a tick better then before although the Fried Chicken might have taken a step back - the appearance of a very pale coating and unidentifiable shapes kept me from even putting it on my plate, perhaps bravery will become me and I will indulge on a future trip.  Also, the soup is lacking flavor, even with soy sauce and won ton chips added. Now making an odd appearance: Tamales.  I inquired about their contents and was met with, \"I'm not sure what meat is in them; chicken, I believe.\"  Thus, I left them wrapped in cellophane on the buffet for someone else to discover.  On the plus side, the fountain drinks are now less expensive.   Overall, Tao Yuan has improved in more ways than not, albeit small improvements and probably not really noticeable to repeat diners unless you saw the grand opening banner hanging out front.  The dining experience is now much quieter than before as there is less kitchen noise.  Perhaps it is because mom and family are not in back cooking and talking among the dishwashing, radio playing and pot banging.  Either way, low volume music playing in the dining area would benefit all if it were added, at least to mask the mastication and plate scraping of other diners and would make everyone feel a bit more comfortable while eating.    The restaurant feels a bit cleaner but with less energy from the staff; it is as if things are on 3/4 time - no big rush to do things or a sense of urgency.  The checkout is now next to the buffet and not next to the door.  This makes a bit more sense, although, I did notice what seemed like one of the owners texting or playing games on their phone behind the register rather than tending to drink refills and removal of plates from the tables.    What still remains is the nearly identical d√©cor, painted windows, red buffet signs and the orange tabletops with wood grain booths and dark brown stacking chairs, all desperately crying out for a makeover.  Therefore, my rating has not changed much, up a few stars in some areas, lowered in others . . . Either way, Tao Yuan is still a decent value for a smaller buffet at $6.15 for Lunch and $6.85 for Dinner.    If you just want to put the feedbag on and get your buffet fix without battling the crowds at the larger 30+ entr√©e buffets, then this is your place.  Here is hoping for additional improvements in food and a facelift or interior makeover in the days to come.  Overall Rating: 3.2 Stars Food: 3.5 Stars Service: 2.8 Stars Cleanliness: 3.2 Stars Atmosphere: 2.6 Stars Price/Value: 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Nice place to get some inexpensive and fast food  Prices are right, fast and simple Chinese food.  I will definitely come back when I need something decent and reliable."}
{"text":"This restaurant got the one star for friendliness but holy cow the food deserved less than a star. I read all the previous Yelp reviews and thought \"ok, so one guy had a bad experience\" that happens. But Kyle H. had it right ~ it was awful. My husband and I have spent some considerable time in the Asian countries so we know good Chinese food. However we also understand that we get the Americanized version here and so we go into it with low expectations. We haven't found a good (lot less great) Chinese restaurant here in the valley and after eating at Tao Yuan's restaurant the search will continue.  I ordered take out and it was a little bit of a hassle that the restaurant didn't have a website so we could see their menu and call in our order but I figured I'd just suck it up and wait the first time and then get a menu for the next time (little did I know at the time that I would throw away the menu with the food later). I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It was flavorless and mushy. The meat was slimy and tasted like it might have been out of a can with no distinguishable difference between the white and dark meat - assuming there was actually white meat in here somewhere.  My husband ordered Shrimp Low Mein and the noodles were overcooked and the dish was fairly bland. I also ordered Vegetable Fried Rice hoping I could have it for lunch the next day. When I couldn't eat the Kung Pao Chicken I started eating the rice only to find it overcooked and mushy. How can you possibly screw up rice for goodness sake? It was inedible. And to finish it all off I had a Spring Role that after taking one bite I spit it into my napkin. We took the whole dinner and threw it in the trash.   See what I'm saying? If you spend your hard earned money to buy food it shouldn't be in your napkin and in your garbage can. This is a disastrous eating establishment. Think twice before eating here."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Tao Yuan today for the first time and am very impressed! The delivery came in under an hour and everything we ordered was exceptionally good! I've ordered Chinese from a few local restaurants a bunch of times and the flavor of this food surpassed all of them.  We tried: the orange chicken (amazing) the beef lo mein (also amazing) Gai Pang Beef (sooo good)  The quality of the meat and quantity of the food was great and large.   I would recommend all of those dishes. Check them out! I know I'll be ordering again in the future!"}
{"text":"I will never return to Tao Yuan ever again, which is a HUGE disappointment. I've returned many times with family and friends and their food was always delicious and consistent. However, my last visit couple of weeks ago has me warning others.  My husband and I went for a late lunch and it was the only thing we ate that day. By 2 a.m., I was hugging the porcelain throne and my husband was in the other bathroom, miserable himself. We were both hit with food poisoning and suffered for days. Since it was the only thing we ate, there is no doubt it was the food from Tao Yuan.   This was the first time we both had food poisoning and can't say it was fun. Since all our other experience was great and the owners are fantastic, I can't rate one star but after that experience, there is no way we will be returning."}
{"text":"I had to give it one star to post this. I have eaten rotten, expired food before, I will eat pretty much anything, my gut is lined with steel. I have never felt so close to vomiting after eating before. If you like grey undercooked old chicken that has been under an lightbulb (yes I said light bulb no heat lamp). Soggy meat (I'm not sure exactly how meat can be soggy but it was). Some sick experiment using spagetti noodles and Asian,..... You know what there isn't really any way to describe just how disgusting this place was. Here is the best part we leave within 3 minutes of sitting down and they don't even ask if everything was ok i.e. The food. I should have said we weren't paying but I was worried that they may not give me the antidote to whatever they poise we me with if I caused any trouble. And I'm sorry I didn't warn the men that came in as I was leaving, if you are reading this I hope you are still alive. I'm pretty sure I'll be taking my wife to have her stomach pumped now."}
{"text":"They did a really good job. Singapore style mai fun noodles were spot on! It looks like the previous owners had a buffet.... good riddance."}
{"text":"This little Chinese Restaurant puts on a buffet that is delicious and has variety. The food is really good the atmosphere is nice and comfortable family style. Lunch specials fron 11:00 to 4:00 P.M.love it!!!!!! They have House specials for more then one person. If you like Chinese then by all means give this , place a try best Chinese in Mesa AZ"}
{"text":"Eight months ago this would have been a 5 star review however the restaurant has new owners and it's just not the same.  We have become frequent diners at this restaurant since 2005 & since Judy has left the flavor of the food has too. Sadly we won't be back as we won't drive from South Gilbert for a mediocre meal.  Good luck to the new owners. Judy set the bar high."}
{"text":"Great little place! Owners are super friendly. Buffet is small but delicious. Menu looks amazing. We will be coming here again soon. Can't beat a $6.55 dinner!!!!   Buffet had steam white rice, fried rice, egg rolls (DELICIOUS!), lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, egg drop soup, egg foo yong, chicken chop suey, lo mein, and peppers with beef. Food was all warm or hot- great!  Also has a pretty extensive menu that is cheap.  Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"So now there is yet another new owner of this restaurant. I think they took over in Feb 2017.  The owners name is Lee and his father is the chef. They totally redecorated and cleaned this restaurant. It's no longer a buffet. Their prices are cheap and the food is great. Very fresh and not too oily. We got the combination plates. Very good customer service.  If you liked the original owners, you will love these people,cooking and prices. They give you enough food that you will most likely need to take some leftovers home. We are big eaters and we still bring alot of leftovers home. They also have delivery and take out. Try them out. It's great!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had. Cheap and tasty. I tried the all you can eat buffet before, delicious and only 5 bucks and some change. Tonight though I ordered to go and the food was just as good. Sesame chicken, orange chicken, fried rice, lo mein and eggroles. Gosh their eggroles are heaven. You get so much food for the price, I got the smaller combo and oh boy it wasn't small at all. So so so good! The owner Judy is so sweet too, great service! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"$5.85 all you can eat chinese lunch buffet? sign me up. The food was good and the woman running the place was very polite and attentive. this is not the huge selection like the super buffets, but honestly what you should expect from a chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"How do you fuck up rice ? I got chowmein lunch special and it looked like the guy in the back puked up into the take out box and closed it up and bagged it ... Great Wall of China is the better Chinese out in AZ"}
{"text":"This place should really have two reviews, one for eating in and one for take out. My take out experience is much better, the food is fresh and palatable, but still has a ways to get close to the better Chinese restaurants. The lunch prices are reasonable for what you get, though, so I still order out regularly.  If you eat in, however, the buffet food is mostly soggy and you will have to search through the trays, plates, and bowls to find clean ones. This makes me worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen. Overall, the place has potential, but it currently gives the impression that the owners don't care too much, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around as a fixture of Mesa for over 20 years and I have been a customer since before 2004. The food is excellent, well prepared, and the owners are always welcoming. Being a family owned business, customers are valued and treated well. If you like buffet style dining, that is a great option, but, if you prefer menu options, the menu offers a more diverse selection."}
{"text":"Good little local score!! Clean basic restaurant w/ really good food backed up w/ great service."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I thought they got pretty good reviews so I decided to try them. The seating arrangement is interesting because the seats around the walls of the restaurant are all basically fast food seating, they're bench style seats that don't adjust so the tables are a little snug for a big fella like me.  The waiter was prompt and asked me if I wanted something to drink, and I ordered hot tea; he came a short while later. He handed me the menu and I looked through it, and I had previously looked at the one online before coming in so I had an idea of what I wanted. I ordered egg rolls, egg drop soup and General Tsao's chicken. There's a television on the wall and it's playing the evening news. I thought it should be playing some type of sports instead, which is more applicable to a wider audience. It was actually a little distracting and I noticed it throughout my meal. There was no background music playing, I like music in a restaurant it makes it a more peaceful environment. My soup and eggrolls were served first. The egg drop soup was quite delicious. I also enjoyed the egg rolls they weren't over done and very delicious as well. My meal came a short while later hot and delicious looking I dug in and ate about 3/4 of it it was very delicious. It was served with white rice, and there was a sauce with the chicken that made it very nice. Based on the reviews and my experience the food is very good here. There are little tweaks that they could do to make it better, one is to change out the glassware that they use for tea. The handles on the tea cups get very hot from the tea. Traditional earthenware spoons would be nice, the Chinese type for the soup. They have a lot of pictures of food in the window when you come in, I think these could be removed and it wouldn't take away from the restaurant at all. I'm not sure it serves them for advertising. The last thing is is they should offer what I ordered for \"dinner for one\" with a price $9.95. I had leftovers and I would've just preferred to just eat one meal served with fried rice an egg roll and a smaller portion and sell the ton out of it. This would attract the larger market that I think they may be unaware of. The small details were the things that prevented them from getting four stars, their food is definitely 4 stars, so give them a try."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite Chinese food place. We come in every week, and sometimes I'll order delivery from work.   The food is delicious and hot with very friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"Meh! I ordered teriyaki chicken. You'd think that would be hard to mess up but meh! Fatty dark meat chicken that had no flavor or sauce. Sauce was served separately. Nobody else liked their dinners either. Flavorless. It's disappointing because other reviews said this place was great but I think it's lacking"}
{"text":"Family owned, sit down (no longer buffet), amazing service, low prices, and the food....simply delicious!!!!   Highly recommend, our favorite Chinese food place!  Clean and inviting, nice atmosphere, looks like newly remodeled!"}
{"text":"Dude!  I tried this place only because I found their menu on the ground walking to my front door.  My husband called to placw the order.  The guy who answered was perfectly understandable (often not the case when one calls for Chinese takeout).  We ordered three meals altogether; two adult combos and a kids meal.  Each adult meal came with the entree, rice, an egg roll, and two crab puffs.  The kids meal was a meat stick, fries, an egg roll, and a crab puff.  It was a heck of a lot of food for three people.  And the total bill was $26 (and that includes the tip for the driver). We can't have pizza delivered for that cheap!  On top of how courteous the employees are and how cheap the food is, it was no joke the best beef broccoli I have ever had! My picky af husband ate every bite of his food too!  And then the cherry on top is that they said our order would be delivered in about an hour because it is Super Bowl Sunday and they're busy.  Our food, no shit, was delivered 16 minutes after placing the order."}
{"text":"I order garlic chicken that had no salt, no favoring, it was totally flat. I ordered fried rice that had a very bad smell and was not edible. I will never order from here again"}
{"text":"Okay so I love Asian food I will try any type or kind of Asian food being that I live across the street I went to try this place out to support my local business as I approached the door there was a sign all you can eat buffet I'm like okay that's a good deal I headed with my friend and she says do you want to buffet or do you want to order off the menu so we say we're here for the buffet once we get to the buffet we looked at the food and it looks disgusting spend sitting out it has no taste no wonder why it's all you can eat cuz she wants to get rid of it I thought maybe she had a bad day so I came back in with my mom because she was wanting Asian food so I told her let's not do the buffet was just order something off the menu cuz its fresh we ordered the Mongolian beef fried rice and lo mein and it was incredible if you're going to eat here don't eat the buffet order off the menu"}
{"text":"I really hate giving one star to a restaurant unless I have just a really horrible experience, but the food here is too bad to give it any more than that.  This place is a hole in the wall at Greenfield and Main at the end of a strip mall.  I was hoping it was one of those type of places where the restaurant looks terrible but the food is amazing- I was wrong.  I went in there at lunch time and the place was packed with seniors.  I figured with a bunch of old folks there, it was bound to be good and cheap, but evidently it caters more to the set that doesn't have many taste buds left.  It's hard to imagine a meal costing just over $5 not being worth your money these days, but I really felt this was not worth the little that I spent.  Granted, I did get the lunch buffet- which had a very limited selection.  I know often times the food off the menu is better, but I can't honestly see how it could be too much better at this place.  The pepper beef was virtually tasteless, and the beef had more of a consistency of tofu than a cow product.  another entree, honey chicken, tasted very little like honey, and the chicken pieces tasted overly fried.  The spare ribs were very small, and was predominantly sauce, which was almost sickeningly sweet.  The fried rice was ok, I suppose it's hard to screw that up.  The white rice was very sticky.  With hot tea and tax, my meal came to a total of $6.06.  I don't think I  have ever eaten so little at a buffet.  They do offer a menu, but I don't think I will be back to try it.  There are way too many Chinese restaurants out there to waste another meal at this place."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese restaurant, family owned, not a buffet like some of the pics show. We were taken here by some friends that said this was the best Chinese food in the area and they were right! The son, one of the owners, Lee is so kind and caring he really wants to make sure you're taken care of. The food was delicious, fresh and boy was there ALOT!  I'd definitely recommend trying this place, it doesn't look like anything fancy but the best places often aren't. Oh ya, the crab puffs and hot/sour soup were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Most combo lunches are under 6 bucks. The food and the service was very well done. The portions are not the largest I have ever had, but enough and very tasty. When in Mesa we will continue to enjoy this little gem of a restaurant ."}
