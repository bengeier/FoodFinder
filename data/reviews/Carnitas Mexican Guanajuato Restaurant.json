{"text":"I have gone twice since this location opened.  The fare is not at all tex-mex but authentic Mexican.  As other reviewers noted, they bring a great variety of salsa with the chips.  It is very fresh and flavor able, with different heat levels.  By far my favorite dish so far is the carnitas.  Fantastic flavor and so tender.  It comes with two sides, beans and rice, the same bland types you get at all Mexican places.  I would like to see some lettuce and tomato on the side as we'll.    it would be good to see maybe special plate combinations with carnitas.
   I have also had the combo fajitas and they were very good.    Came out sizzling an the best part the vegetables were not overlooked.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas and they were excellent.  Very good seasoning on both.  The service was good when we went both times.
  I ordered the house margarita and although the flavor was real good, it could have a little more tequila in it.  The menus are terrible.  Bring a magnifying glass if you want to read it.  
  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out more than I have eaten there. The food is always great. This is the only place I have been able to get sope's since moving from SoCal. They do them right. This is definitely my go to place for Mexican on the north side of 74."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service is extremely slow (we have been twice) and were one of two tables there. Had to ask for drinks and refill of chips a couple of times. Our waitress seemed more concerned with cleaning another table than helping us. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and made from scratch, the portions were good for the price, and the service was remarkable as long as you speak a little Spanish! This is faaaar better than the \"Salsas\" that inhabited the area before."}
{"text":"just moved close to this so trying some new places. food was pretty good. I got the shrimp fajitas. if I could change anything I would change the layout. I felt cramped just sitting there with my family. could have used some more space. would i come back? yes, but take out"}
{"text":"Seems authentic.  We have been a few times now.   Chips and three to five different salsas arrive pretty quickly after being seated.  I typically get a couple of tacos - they are dirt cheap and it ends up being plenty to eat.  Many guests at the weekday lunch hour are hispanic, which says a lot!"}
{"text":"Strange.  First off, a blaring tv above our heads.  Asked the staff if they could turn it down.  The response: \"we don't know where the remote is\".  Wow.

We ordered the fajitas for TWO.  They were good but only came with 5 shells.  5?  For two people?   So we asked for more shells.  When the bill came we got charged for extra shells.  Totally ridiculous.  5 shells for two people to eat fajitas is borderline lunacy.  So ridiculous in fact we didn't even bother arguing about it.  Just paid the tab a swore to never come back.

You can have your precious fajita shells."}
{"text":"We are here at dinner time and the Food was extremely salty even for Mexican food. Service was great but food was sub par at best I will not eat here again"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. As far as the food, not so great. The beans were very bland as was the beef burrito that I had. Neither myself or my wife enjoyed the food. I doubt we will be back here. There are much better Mexican restaurants around within the same price range."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the new Carnitas Mexican that opened in Stevens Mill since it's two minutes from our house. We had good service, our waitress was really nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Food is authentic, not your mexican-american joint. I was happy to see a few dishes here that I had in Mexico.  

Overall, I would go back, the food was good, the service was good, and the prices weren't bad! 

Only downside it the beans could have been warmer."}
{"text":"We thought we would give it another try... Won't be going back anytime soon.  Service was slow and inattentive, food was bland and meager portion size.  Tacos, burritos and quesadilla look and taste the same... Flavorless flour tortillas either rolled, folded or 2 paired up.... Service was nice, but slow and not very attentive. 

  However, they do bring out 3 salsas and a bowl of lime wedges with the chips."}
{"text":"Like the Carnitas in Charlotte...this place is a hidden gem.  Great food, excellent service, and love those chips with all that salsa!   I'd highly recommend anyone looking for something different, to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Have only ordered takeout from here, but it's always been good. We especially like the special meal where you get a whole chicken and a pound of carnitas for under $16 during the week. It is so much food we can make several meals off of it. There is sometimes a communication problems and we don't get the correct salsas we requested, but all in all it is authentic Mexican vs. Tex-Mex and our new favorite place for takeout Mexican."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and the food was bad and I didn't even get what I asked.. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I don't know what that was, but it wasn't Mexican food. 

It was like El Torito and Denny's made a baby together.

The staff was friendly and prompt, they answered my snob from California questions. They definitely kept this from being a 1 Star review.

The restaurant itself was shabby... but not hole-in-the-wall shabby. It had that cheap-but-trying-to-be-nice feeling. 

But the food... the food was the real kicker. The chicken was bland and slightly dry, but edible. The \"steak\"... inedible. Fatty, gristly, no flavor, over cooked, crap. 

I feel bad saying it because they were so nice, but I'll go to Taco Bell before I go to this place again."}
{"text":"The prior incarnation of restaurant here was also Mexican (it was a Salsa's if I recall).

First off is the layout of the place. It's a bit odd - that doesn't have to affect the place, as typically you only take up a booth or a table, but in this case it does, because it's so, so tiny, and it seems as if you walk in and the employees are always around the corner, so they don't see you - service tends to suffer as a result.

Second is that once you do get service, getting the food can take a little while for the food to be delivered. That's not horrible - sometimes it can take a while for fresh food. But here the wait goes on and on for almost everything, and we're not talking rocket science to deliver a basket of chips and salsa while waiting.

Finally, the food itself isn't that great. Recently we were next door at Best China and overheard a conversation that seemed to indicate that the owners of that restaurant owned this one. Not sure if that's the case, but if so, it may explain some of the oddities."}
{"text":"We tried Carnitas today for the first time, and we couldn't have been more pleased.  The service was very good and the food was wonderful.  It definitely had a made in the kitchen, authentic Mexican flavor.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Chips and variety of salsas were good.  Communication a little difficult, we asked for waters with lemons and got water, no ice and a small bowl of limes. My rice nd beans and salad for steak fajitas came out but no fajitas and my wife's cheese quesadilla was shredded cheese not even melted in a Luke warm tortilla shell.  I gave three stars instead of two because of the salsas and the fajitas did taste good despite coming out 10 minutes later than everyone else's food.  Also had to wait for the check.  Decent food but needs some management it sounds like."}
{"text":"Pretty gross, not clean, and food was subpar. Weird place overall and not a great dine in experience. Very low traffic, honestly don't know how they're still in business."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place in a million years been in there almost 45 minutes haven't gotten any drinks yet we're the only ones in the restaurant horrible horrible and actually I'm on my way out I will never go back"}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff. Good service. Food, eh not so much. Pollo Fundillo was frozen chicken chunks with a weird cheese sauce. Served open with flour tortillas. What's that you say? That's not pollo fundido!?? You would be correct! Because we all know Pollo Fundido is actually Shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla and fried...then cream cheese and cheddar on top and flash broiled to melt it. You get the soft chicken the crispy tortilla and the rich cheese. Not the mess they served me. For the low price of 11$ I will still complain. My dining partner had a marinated pork stuffed burrito. The stuff inside was dry and scabby. She got full after discussing it. With so many great places in the area to go I don't think I'll be back here unless I'm being chased by zombies. The chips were good the salsa was wet."}
