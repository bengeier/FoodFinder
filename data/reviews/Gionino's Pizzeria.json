{"text":"This pizza fluctuates from excellent to fairly good depending upon who is working at the time. Take this rating with a grain of salt, this is not 5/5 pizza. I would give it an overall of 4.4/5, due to the lack of consistency and quality customer service. Certainly this restaurant does not deserve a 2/5 rating... if you order on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I need to say the Italian Sausage sandwich that I ate tonite was one of the best ever! From the bakery style bun to the great tasting sausage link.The onions and green peppers that are chopped .Nice touch ! So I don't take a bite and stand there fighting to bite through a long green pepper .Just the right amount of sauce and topped with real cheese.All this heated to perfection. Definitely will be partaking of this fine sandwich again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EVIL OWNER! If I could give negative I would! In town working for 4 months and was given their menu. Ordered a med deluxe pizza minus the sausage add beef. They wrote my number down wrong and we're unable to call me when they lost power to tell me I would have no delivery. After 1 1/2 hours and no pizza I called them back and found out, they said they would refund my card and where sorry. Ok I get it no problem with that. I received a call 5 min later to inform me that they had power and would make my order if I wanted. They had already charged my card so I said ok. When we got the pizza it had sausage on it and no dipping sauce for the bread sticks(it says in the menu that it comes with). I thought ok someone made a mistake I'll just take it back and get a new pizza...yeah right! I called them and she told me that I didn't tell them that it was no sausage and she wasn't going to fix it and that if I wanted dipping sauce then I should have asked for it. She would not let me talk at all and eventually hung up on me! Then called me back on a blocked number to tell me that she called her employee and confirmed that I was wrong. I was so mad at this point I told her just forget about it I was bringing her pizza back and wanted my money back. She told me that she wasn't going to give me my money and that if I showed up at the store she was calling the cops. When I got there the cops were waiting on me. The owner/manager whatever this woman is told me when I walked in in front of the officer \"to get out of her f**king store\". Yeah the cops said she was an idiot to. I pointed out to her as I left the pizza on her counter that if the employee had my phone number wrong maybe he had my order wrong, and if I worked for someone like her I would have lied too. Lied to me about who the owner was/is and when I called the next day to talk to someone they didn't like me leaving a message saying that I was getting a copy of the police report and taking it to my bank. An employee called my back 2 hours later to say that they would refund my $ back to my card but that they were never delivering to the hotel I was staying at again.  (The manager laughed when I told her and said ok there are plenty of other pizza places with better pizza.). And then hung up on me. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WHATSOEVER!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to order 4 sheet pizzas for a party I will be hosting in 3 days. I called to order and was told they would not deliver to my home which is 1.2 miles away. I am very disappointed. Maybe I spoke with the wrong person?"}
{"text":"This place has TERRIBLE customer service! I placed a delivery order tonight for a pizza and boneless wings with sauce to share. The order came on time and the pizza was piping hot and delicious. The wings however were dry and had so little sauce someone actually asked if I accidentally ordered plain ones. I proceeded to call and let them know I was unsatisfied with the state of the wings. The first person I spoke to was very combative and argued that nothing was wrong with the wings. I was very confused as I was not trying to argue I was stating my dissatisfaction and looking for them to simply rectify the situation. He then passed the phone to someone else ( without ever telling me he was doing it so I was a little off guard when the next person answered) who was even more uncaring. When I told him my problem he also stated I was wrong and said that it was just my opinion. Yes it was my opinion and the opinion of the three other people I was sharing it with and I believe our opinions are what matter! These wings were so sauceless one fell on the carpet and didn't even leave a stain!! Anyway after telling him again the wings were unsatisfactory he said \"well what do you expect me to do?\" I asked for him to simply come back take the dry wings and bring fresh ones. He said no, that he could give me a \"store credit\" and I can call another day and they will bring me some then. This person NEVER took my name or my phone number so how I'm supposed to redeem this store credit I don't know. I cannot stress the amount of disdain these people had for a paying customer! They were so callous and uncaring for my plight and acted as if it was a chore just to listen to me. I wouldn't even be upset if one person ever actually APOLOGIZED. I believe i was being reasonable by just asking for a replacement as we hadn't eaten more than two wings yet they acted as if I asked for them to comp my entire order and then give me the food free! It's sad when the customer service of an establishment is so bad customers feel the need to post reviews online. Again the pizza was delicious it was the service that left a bitter taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I moved to mentor from columbus and have been having a hard time finding any pizzas I like. This defiantly is not a good one. The crust was rubbery like a frozen dough you could get from a super market, the sauce was tangy, and cheese was waxy. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza when you're hungry and in a hurry.  I wouldn't recommend their wings though."}
{"text":"My husband and I's favorite place for pizza! Our personal favorite is the Five Cheese Gourmet. The wings and subs are also very delicious. Great staff and always consistent on their food. They have it all! Love it."}
{"text":"Honestly we go here mainly for the chicken. The chicken meals with JoJo potatoes are really good and the slaw is great. We recently tried the caprese pizza and we are a huge fan. We love and eat a lot of pizza and this one is fresh and a nice change of pace from typical pizza flavors.   I'm typically treated well when calling in orders and appreciate the \"yes ma'am\" and \"thank you ma'am\" from the guys."}
{"text":"Gioninos pizza is one of the better pizzas in Medina. The sauce has a sweet taste to it. The sweet pairs good with pepperoni.  The crust is thick. They put a good amount of cheese. The toppings are not as generous. Their wings are tasty and meaty but a little greasy."}
{"text":"I don't see how people say their food is good. For the price they charge, their food is not good. I guess I remember ordering from the Gionino\"s Pizzeria that was on Transportation, in Garfield Heights many years ago. I loved their pizza & chicken back then. This was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Love the great food. Salads are excellent and house dressing some of the best Italian dressing I've ever had. We buy bottles of it. Delivery is prompt, food always hot and yummy. Best pizza place in town."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys the pizza here.  Something about it is unique, idk what, but it tastes good.   We usually get a basic sausage pizza, but one time we got one of the specialty pizzas.  Both were good.  We do pick up so I can't speak to delivery times.  We've gotten other sides (jojo fries, fried chicken, and salad) and they were good too.  I feel like they don't have a ton of staff and are always busy, but they've always been kind when I come in there."}
{"text":"So far Gionino's \"pizza\" beats all the other pizza around Medina area. Now I am recommending  their \"Pizza\". I have not tried anything else in their menu so that is why I am giving them 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza place in town. Buffalo chicken pizza...give it a try and you won't be disappointed. I also recommend trying their fried chicken and jojos. Awesome."}
{"text":"I haven't found an item on the menu that I dislike. Our staff regularly orders pizzas, salads and subs and, not only feel that the food is delicious, but that the price for lunches is cheeper than other puzzarias in the area. This store participates in the Belly loyalty program which is also a plus."}
{"text":"From time to time, I stop in to grab a slice (or two) for lunch.  The Pizza is pretty good - not as good as pizza in the Northeast but then I've yet to find anything that good in this neck of the woods.  The crust is thick and chewy but has a good flavor and there is plenty of cheese on top.  So at $3 a slice you can't go wrong AND the folks here are always very friendly."}
{"text":"The best pizza around for carry out or delivery. They use real provolone and other quality ingredients. A large pizza here is bigger than everywhere else. The chicken and other menu items are good, but I rarely order them because the pizza is so good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and delivery! The pizza was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and am already thinking about what I want to try next! Hands down best pizza I have had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Great service, old school style pizzeria pizza from my youth-- but get the fried chicken and jojos, Awesome!"}
{"text":"Should maybe be a 1 star. The dough itself was very good.  We ordered a large deluxe it was on time for pick up, the counter personal were nice enough,  the pizza appearance and smell was great.  Then I noticed all the topping were under the cheese,  my first bite was very disappointing,  the green peppers and onions were still raw, the sausage must have been pre-cooked because it was good.  Not the worst pizza I have eaten but not the pizza for me."}
{"text":"Busy place on Friday.   Solid effort on the pizza.  Very tomato-ey sauce.  Boneless wings were good- had the sweet n spicy.  Just a few small tables if you want to eat there."}
{"text":"Pizza is average at best.  Customer service is poor.  Store benefits from its location - drive a few minutes further to one of the local pizza joints."}
{"text":"I love this place and I am not even a pizza lover but  this place is sooo extremly delicious. I cant say enough good things"}
{"text":"I've always known the delivery guys had to go out of their way to deliver to me and I've always tipped accordingly. I had even somewhat established a rapport with two of the drivers there. But just today, after 4 YEARS as a loyal and regular customer, they tell me I'm 11 BLOCKS past where they are willing to deliver now and therefore I can only place carryout orders from now on. I did nothing to warrant this! I've always been a pleasant customer and I've NEVER tipped less than 20% (last time I tipped $10 on a $30 tab!) and I've always spoken highly of Gionino's to friends and today I was just written off like I'm nothing. I'd end this review by saying they lost my business, but that goes without saying since it was their choice to lose me as a customer. I'm just so disappointed."}
{"text":"Was here again last night for the 3rd time in 3 weeks. The best pizza and chicken wings around! I hear the other food is pretty damn good too.  Staff here are great, always polite, friendly and clean!"}
{"text":"Gioninos pizza was good, but do not believe it to be the best in Medina.  Now, we've only been once, put the sauce tasted very spicy; however, while at PizzaPalooza in Medina, did like their pizza the most, so we may have to try again.  The JoJos were decent, but extremely greasy."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because the pizza is my kids absolute favorite and the house salad dressing is second to none! That being said. The pizzas decent, but I've never gotten a correct delivery if the order was more than 2 items. That's totally disappointing when I'm really wanting something specific. Maybe it's a sauce one time, then a missing pizza topping the next, but something is ALWAYS wrong. My kids love it, I'll continue to order and try to cook myself something beforehand....  Fast forward one month...in true fashion of my kids, they want pizza. It has to be gioninos. So, of course I ordered it. We got pizza and chicken with jo-jos. Let me say, their chicken is good. A tad pricey, but worth it. We all get our own pizzas, and mine was loaded with toppings (none forgotten) and I couldn't wait to dig in. I did...to RAW dough. Not a bit under, totally raw....c'mon y'all. Change a girls opinion."}
{"text":"Gioninos is some damn good food. I like the jojos , wings, pizza, philly steak and occasionally a salad. Seriously, I highly recommend it if you're hungry and thinking about ordering out."}
{"text":"I've been to other Gionino's, but this was my first time at the Broadview location. Very convenient location near Marcos. The customer service is the first thing you'll notice, they have a young and friendly staff and fast service. The inside is extremely clean and were playing the Indians game on three TVs so I just ate there.   The took an extra moment to extra check to ensure everything was perfect before serving me. The sausage and pepperoni pizza was excellent and I will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and more!!! Super menu and fast delivery !!! They have multiple locations and have many awards!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, huge, yummy subs, love the wings.  Prices reasonable for the quality and service provided.  Be prepared for a 1/2 hour wait for you food when you call in, they make your order from scratch."}
{"text":"best pizza in west park! boneless wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"My work orders from here a few times a week and we usually leave a very large tip because the food is great. But yesterday we were all low on cash and couldn't afford a large tip.  the delivery guy was very rude and actually complained \"you guys usually tip me $5-10 dollars\". almost as if he was demanding more money. It's a tip, it's optional. We don't have to tip you anything if we don't want to. Learn some manners please. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"If you want average, Cleveland-style (doughy, greasy, lacking sauce, flavor, etc), this is your place!"}
{"text":"chicken was overcooked and dry  a complete waste of money"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and phenomenal taste!!! I enjoyed a small cheese pizza during their lunch special for only $4.10! HIGHLY recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken super greasy and terrible terrible service. Pizza is normally ok. But I had a bad experience today and this was the last straw, trust me hudson have some awesome restaurants and spending money and getting bad service is so not worth it..look at the other reviews, service here sucks!"}
{"text":"Terrible TERRIBLE customer service. Delivery is never less than 1.5 hours because they are ALWAYS \"so busy\".  Staff is rude on the phone and the pizza is cold by the time it gets here (I live 5 minutes from the store). Gioninos pizza is amazing and I've never had this experience at any other location. From now on I'll pick the pizza up from another location. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"What GREAT pizza!! Who knew?? Well, me, now.  I've only ever gotten take-out, but it's been excellent every one of 5-6 times.  The sauce is a hearty, thick, bright tomato red! Toppings are fresh, plentiful, and delicious. The people were extremely pleasant and a large pizza only took about 10 mins to prepare, from order to boxed up & ready to go."}
{"text":"I get halfway through my order and lady gets mad a d hangs up all because i was asking a question super rude when i called back too."}
{"text":"I think their pizzas are the best around!!!   Fast delivery. We use Aurora's location also. Only place we get our pizzas now - Gianinos!! So glad they have so many close locations."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place is Gianinos. Just wrote review for Streetsboro location, too. Tried all the other local  pizza places,  they  don't come close."}
{"text":"So I just ordered a small order for delivery at 7:30 1/02/18 and the pleasure of speaking with the most moronic, rude associate of Gioninos yet.   Following my order, unfortunately I had to pay with credit card, and as I finished saying the card numbers (all the while hearing goofing off and laughter in the background), he asked me to repeat the numbers again slowly, and one digit at a time. After hearing what I heard in the background, I was afraid they were writing down my credit card numbers.  As well as how rude the associate was asking me to say them again, one digit at a time.  Already cancelled my credit card to avoid any false charges."}
{"text":"Pizza awesome but the chicken seems to get greesier each time when we order the family pack....will stick with pizza only from now on."}
{"text":"you advertise that you have a monthly special and then you do not answer the phone can not contact you on the website and then you answer the next day and say we were closed.. no answer machine nothing to the public you just close no instruction to this, the other stores do not know what is happening to you so hello you need to step this up and correct this issue. you close and go on vacation for a week and again no advisement that you do this. so I guess you just do not want any business"}
{"text":"My family and I all agree that Gionino's Pizza is one of the best 3 pizza shops in Medina! We always receive very courteous service from everyone who works there. The delivery staff is always very prompt and polite and always genuinely grateful for their tip. The restaurant is always very clean, as well as the staff. Now about the food! AMAZING!!! We have ordered many different foods and pizzas from them over the years and the quality and quantity never disappoint us. Our favorite pizza to order from them is the basic pepperoni pizza. They already give you a generous amount of cheese and pepperoni but if you ask for extra cheese and extra pepperoni, believe me when I say, that you definitely get what you pay for and then some! One slice will fill you up! Their sauce is delicious! Perfectly combined spices so that its not to spicy or to sweet, but just right. We have also enjoyed their Hawaiian pizza and their white pizza. I personally love the white pizza and its just as good the next day too!  We have also ordered their chicken dinners that come with Jojo's and coleslaw. Again, absolutely delicious and simply mouth watering! Crispy chicken on the outside and moist on the inside. Jojo's were the same, cooked to perfection. Their Penne pasta bake paired with their garlic bread was also great!  They have amazing sub's there as well. We have tried meatball sub, Philly steak, Italian sausage, chicken and the deluxe sub's. They were all to die for! So many delicious choices and so little room in my belly for them all. Haha! We also love their Antipasto salad. My only \"complaint\" with that, is I wish they would add more tomatoes. Although I'm sure if I asked them to, they would.  Now, dessert! We have tried it all. And just like their lunch and dinner choices, it will not disappoint you. Their cheesecake is very good. So is their Cinnabake dish. I am a chocolate lover thou, so I hope to see them add something \"chocolatey\" to their menu in the near future. Haha! But other then that, Gionino's Pizzeria is a fabulous pizza shop that I hope continues to bring us great food at its affordable prices for a very long time!! I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Topping were under the cheese.  Everything just slid right off. Crust was floppy and soggy. Haven't found a good pizza place since moving here."}
{"text":"We teach our kids to be thankful.  When someone hands you something; food, money, anything...you say thank you...it doesn't matter, you just do that.  Its the right thing to do.  I struggled with this rule-of-thumb, when this sad, burnt misunderstood thing was handed to me.  I'll admit my expectations for pizza are low.  I'll eat most anything.   But this tested my limits and then some.  I could only stare at it...poke at it....and wonder...how did this leave the kitchen and be presented to someone to eat?  It was nearly cold...actually I've never had a pizza delivered from anywhere that was this cold.  All I could think of was Gordon Ramsey....and the wailing that could be heard if this was presented in the window.  I wish I could have seen that...or heard that.  Perhaps a small consolation to the fact that this was my meal tonight.  Instead, all that could be heard...from room 205 at a hotel in Fairlawn...was my soft whimpering as I chewed on this leather-hard, almost cold, crunchy-yet-tasteless embarassment of a pizza."}
{"text":"Well the delivery was faster than they said so that was a plus. The pizza itself was loaded with meat (meat pizza) the sauce was a little milder than I am used to and the pizza was greasier than I would have liked.  The price was average compared to other pizza shops. All in all it was just an average pizza"}
{"text":"Best pizza in america,  incredible sauce, amazing herbs and spices.  Would get pizza here daily if I could!  Try it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered! From the guy answering the phones all the way up to management, just horrible, rude people. I was talked to so poorly when trying to place my order, that I had them cancel it... and then the MANAGER hung up on me for saying that \"they had not been very unpleasant to deal with\". I have never been so disrespected while simply trying to order a pizza!!  I called the day shift manager the next day and he was just as bad. They pretty much told me because they are a franchise there was nothing I could do about how I was treated. This place should be shut down!"}
{"text":"Love gioninos best pizza in northeast Ohio hands down! If u haven't had it before u need to try it."}
{"text":"The same lady has said that \"they don't have a delivery driver tonight\" the last two times I called, two weeks apart. May I suggest hiring one?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Ordered delivery based on their stars.  They confirmed they delivered to my hotel.    Half our later they called back to say they wouldn't deliver because they just realized they do not deliver to my hotel. Only four miles.   I would have expected them to still honor the delivery even if the manager had to deliver it himself."}
{"text":"Great pizza! My hubby is SUPER picky about his pizza after working at a west-side pizzeria in his younger days. He actually gives this place a thumbs up, halleluiah! The crust is nice and crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. Yummy toppings. Had some boneless buffalo wings (spicy garlic) and they were loaded up with garlic in the sauce. We've enjoyed it each time we've gotten it thus far!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Gionino's in Medina for years. It is always the best pizza around. I have tried others, but Gionino's is always the best, even after new owners took over about a year or so ago. I don't know what happened to the other reviewer, but this pizza is always delicious, the sauce is quite tasty, and the pizza is always ready to go when we go to pick it up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered delivery for the Cavs game and the pizza showed up quickly and was super fresh. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza and we order here a lot. Weather it be at home or at work (usually at work) the pizza is always amazing and the service is awesome. I usually order delivery when I am at work & can't leave and it's always on time if not super early. Thank you guys for all your hard work and contributing to my weight gain LOL  Happy Holidays."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. Unbelievable prices. My husband and I split spaghetti with meatballs and the buffalo chicken salad and could not finish it there was so much food.  Love this place! I wish I could go back but we were just passing through."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I really love their food because they literally have the jerkiest staff I have ever encountered. I get it that you guys are probably the preferred pizza place around here... but when I call and order something off the menu and you tell me you won't make it because you're too busy (in a way like I somehow should have known that) and then hang up on me when I ask why, I'm assuming you don't want my business or really anyone's who is a human with half a brain and knows when someone is being a dick. And I wish I could say this was the first time I got off the phone with them feeling like I somehow inconvenienced them by wanting to place an order. Peace out Tallmadge Gioninos, I wish you lots and lots of people who love pizza more than being treated with decency."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery. Showed up at promised time. I got 6 garlic wings, 6 hot wings, both were good. Also got large pepperoni pizza. The pizza is HUGE and I've never seen so much pepperoni on a pizza. Pretty good and you can tell they don't try and cut corners. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best pizza i have ever had they pulled thru in a snow storm in less time then marcos pizza who never even called me back and had a habit of putting everyone who called on hold waited an waited but for nothing gioninos was awesomeness in a box delivered a beautifully designed and perfectly hot.... perhaps the best bbq chicken pizza i have ever had all that despite having a snow storm outside i was starving that night thankyou for everything ill definitely be ordering from you again soon"}
{"text":"First order here- Tried 8 piece chicken, JoJos , coleslaw and large pepperoni pizza, delivered. Told it would be 30 minutes to an hour. 1 hour later, they called to say the driver was just leaving Food arrived somewhat warm at best Had it come 20 minutes sooner, probably would have given a 4   rating Would have picked it up if knew it would sit for 30-40 minutes after it was ready. Will give another try, but will probably not go with delivery"}
{"text":"Recently ordered nearly $40 of food including 2 pizzas and large order of boneless wings. The wings were not edible. Get this - they offered a store credit only. This is an indication this happens frequently or like most reputable pizza or other fast food places you would get your money back. Will never order from here again. There are tons of pizza place options in and around Solon, OH - I guess they don't understand that fact."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in the Lakewood area. Not too pricey with still good quality. Their crust is amazing and really good sauce. Never a bad choice!"}
{"text":"My grandma orders from here a lot the pizza is hit or miss normally miss, I will say that there boneless wings are pretty good along with there JoJo's,"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the sometimes the service is so bad or fine. Sometimes when I call they seem so annoyed you are calling them to order. The customer service is just so inconsistent that we pass on choosing them because they are so so so rude. Sometimes when you order jo jo's they taste like crap other times they are awesome. If they had friendlier people working there we would choose this place more often. The pizza is really good though."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this! The staff is great, the restaurant is clean, and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"new mgmt - staff seems all kids, food inconsistent - used to be awesome and my go to for sheet pizzas.  last order was burnt and not as ordered. agree that often was raw.  shame"}
{"text":"Sadly good pizza terrible service. Called after an hour and 15 minutes task were my delivery was only two encounter a new employee not muting my call and finding out that the owner did not care about my order. After ordering three consecutive weeks from you guys sorry you lost my business."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Consistently good, service is polite and on time. Nothing super special, but my go to when I want good takeout pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Medina, however the customer service could be better. Their Caprese (Margherita) pizza is perfection. Love their spinach salad, however the last two times I've ordered there for it they gave me a tossed salad and a Caprese salad. Both were delicious, but please get the order right."}
{"text":"Yuk.  Not good at all.  Bland and barely any toppings.  The amount on the entire pizza should have been on 2 slices.  Go across the street to Zeppe's instead."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets. I have been eating neighborhood pizzeria pizza for a long time, with some of my favorite of being Angelo's in Lakewood, Bella's in Old Brooklyn, and Antonio's in Parma, and I'd rank this new neighborhood pizzeria, which I just discovered, right up there with all of these other favorites of mine.  Dont just take my word for it though, let me explain to you why I think this is such fantastic pizza. I have NEVER had so much great tasting sauce on a pizza before, and I love sauce, which is really tasty BTW too. And they don't skimp on the cheese like those national chain places do. And for my taste, the crust was just right, like REAL pizza I grew up on. My Italian side of the family would be proud of the guy who owns this place! I honestly don't know how people can eat that garbage put out by national chains and when I want REAL Italian style and TASTING pizza, this place is going to front of the line for me from now on. Great food, great owner by the name of Dan, whom I talked with because after eating this pizza for the first time, I actually felt motivated to thank him for putting out such a great product. If you want real pizza, then I recommend you get to these guys from now on. I dont' even live close and was visiting a friends, which how I discovered them, but I'll be making the trip back just for some of their great pizza."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and love their wings even more. Reasonable prices, usually honor expired coupons, great customer service. Can't speak to delivery as we pick up bc we live around the corner.  I no longer live in Brunswick but I look forward to ordering food whenever I'm visiting my family in Brunswick."}
{"text":"Great pizza , delivery very nice . but when you call or when you pick it up that's a different story would it hurt you to be polite to your customers"}
{"text":"You know when you don't order out often then when you do it's so disappointing?  This will NEVER happen here!  Pizza and JoJo's are consistently good and staff is always friendly.   Even when 10 people are waiting with the phone is ringing off the hook. I'm glad you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fast, hot delivery during lunch!! Great quality and taste. Really love the easy online ordering."}
{"text":"While we enjoyed our pizza, my kids were disappointed at how floppy the crust was and that made them less excited about eating as much as they usually do. Not sure if this is due to the box it goes in or the quality of the dough. There are better options at the chains around here so we won't be trying it again. We had wings, too, and they were just ok."}
{"text":"Best Pizza that I've had so far, and I've been to New York and Chicago. It's greasy, cheesy, and not too saucy. They have many other foods that are also very good, but the pizza is the reason to go. People have different tastes, so if you like grease and cheese more than sauce, then this is your pizza. I personally love greasy pizza."}
{"text":"Awful customer experience! They messed up my order for a birthday party and would not even acknowledge and take take responsibility for it. There are many other pizzerias around and I will not be returning to Gionino's in the future!"}
{"text":"Great pizza great service! Garden pizza with extra crispy mild wings are our favorite.  Consistently made with best crust. Thank you"}
{"text":"No idea why this place is rated so well. Ordered two nights in a row hoping the first run was a fluke. Had the BBQ chicken and wings with spicy garlic sauce. Pizza was decent, wings were chewy. Second night, just as bad. Had their thin crust and garlic bread with cheese. Pizza was bland and the garlic bread was chewy and didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"I always eat in here and watch a little TV.  It takes a minute for the pizza to be made, and it's what you would expect for a college-town pizza.  The service is pretty good.  They smiled"}
{"text":"Best pizza in West Park in my opinion.Have ordered delivery several times with accurate expected times and friendly service. The italian sausage sub is also great and a bargain for the love inside this sandwich."}
{"text":"This pizza used to be great but the quality has dropped significantly. Also...trying to place an order on the phone with them and all the background noise is too much work.  Poor management. .."}
{"text":"I had such a horrible experience with ordering online and the Manager, Dan, of this establishment needs re-education on customer service and obtaining and maintaining positive relationships with potential patrons. I attempted to place an order online per their website and the website charged my card three times. I called the establishment to inform the management of the error with their online system and ask for some form or service recovery and was given a very rude, aggressive and confrontational response. I understand that the online process is outside of the control of the manager and I never placed blame upon that person but what soured my experience was the interaction with the Dan. He did not appear to care about my business or the business from my establishment. I canceled my order and will not purchase pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic caprese anchovies with white sauce, all on a thin crispy crust!! I think I just found my favorite pizza, ok next too Edison's in Tremont.. Treat yourself to fantastic pie. Get the anchovies then you won't have to worry about the wife or kids digging there paws into your pizza.,LOL."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite pizza places in Akron. I've been out of state for a few years and was happy to be able to have Gionino's again"}
{"text":"I live in Chicago, but I'm a Tallmadge native and I have to say that if this place opened in the Windy City, the term \"Tallmadge-style pizza\" might take off! Tallmadge is Gionino's original location and Sam & Chuck fed my happy family throughout my youth. Whenever relatives visit from out-of-state, they'd DEMAND Gionino's pizza. Still, to this day, Gionino's is a Christmas Eve tradition at our house with multiple sheet pizzas feeding us over several days. Just let me know when I can open a location in Chicago, OK?"}
{"text":"The manager is terrible! They constantly mess up orders then the manager won't do anything to fix it! I ordered a 6 piece chicken all legs and and a medium pizza only peperoni and extra cheese and I got an 8 piece mix chicken and small pizza with nothing at all on it not even cheese! I called and told the manager the mistake and his reply was well that's what we have so that's what you got! This has happened multiple times where they have messed up my order and then refused to fix it also the time online says when they open and close but occasionally they will close a half an hour or an hour early the one night I called an hour and half before they were suppose to close and they told me they were no longer delivering and closing and I was like well it says you close in an hour and a half online so and he responded with well we stop and close when we want and hung up! Worst place of business ever don't waste your money or time"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. My husband and I moved to Youngstown and we have not found anything to compare!! Also, Tallmadge has the best Location."}
{"text":"I am a geek. Like, a stay up all night playing games that people forgot about twenty years ago geek. As such, we're always on the look out for a pizza joint that gives us more bang for the buck. Gioninos delivers. Well, okay. That's a bad choice of words. Gioninos fits the bill. Better?  The pizza is tasty. Our favorite is the buffalo chicken with big ol' chunks of buffalo chicken all over the pizza. And the buffalo sauce is hot enough to make you remember that it's not just a chicken pizza!  The fried chicken and jojos? A bit over fried and dark, but still juicy and flavorful. It reminds me of a place in Lakewood that was open when I was a kid that served chicken in a brown paper bag that was so greasy the bag needed a bag, and the grease still soaked through nearly immediately. But, oh was it tasty. Same case here. KFC should be slinking away in shame for calling their product fried chicken.   The best part? For eight of us geeks to eat and fill up comfortably, it's rarely more than sixty dollars. And that's three or four pizzas, wings, and fried chicken. It's perfect for a gathering where you don't want to pay too much for food.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to put on my wizard hat. There's some goblins that need a slaying, and some gold that needs rescuing."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Sauce is a little sweet, crust is always cooked just right. It might be a little more than other local pizza joints in the area, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Save your money....you will regret it. Bad customer skills, long wait, overpriced, bad food. Not the worst I've ever had, but floating in the same pond."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Pizza always has plenty of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The chicken is delicious. The sweet and spicy wings are my favorite. Never disappointed from this place. Consistently awesome."}
{"text":"I've only been to the one in Solon and I thought the pizza was pretty awful - edible, but awful.  I consider it \"college pizza\" - the kind of pizza that somehow tastes amazingly delicious on saturday at 3am when you're drunk but then tastes sort of icky when you decide to order it when you're sober.  you realize it actually wasn't good pizza at all."}
{"text":"I've had this place two times now... Just doesn't do it for me. Their wings were not very good either. Everything just lacked flavor. I won't be ordering from here anymore. I honestly would prefer geppetos."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute BEST white pizza I have ever had! The sauce is perfect. The veggies always taste good , and are cut to a generous size. We get one every time we come to visit! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place on accident but was glad I did I have tried almost everything on menu it is all awesome except I'm not into the fried chicken.  But pizza is wonderful subs are great pasta is best I have had from any pizza place garlic bread is soooo gooood! Wings are always great hot never over cooked lots of sauce. Big pieces and very reasonable price best I've seen for the great quality! Went to that supposedly awesome wing place up on 615 Quaker steak and lube ? I think. Any way there wings SUCKED! Delivery is always on time or earlier. Food is always hot order is always correct. And service is very good very polite! Love this place. Only one little wish I have had there dessert pizza which is also very good but wish they had another option or 2 for some variety."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place is awesome and the prices are very reasonable. It is worth stopping in to get a pie! (Pizza) and the fried chicken is to die for! Do yourself and your family a favor give it a try!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because they got it together in a big way. The pizza is now quite good and delivery is prompt. This is now my go-to place to order lunch. Good job improving the quality and the service, folks!"}
{"text":"As another reviewer stated, the pizza is consistent.  Unfortunately, part of its consistency is an undercooked crust. The toppings are GREAT, and the flavor is outstanding.  Its just sad that each bite comes with a mouthful of raw dough."}
{"text":"They screwed up our pizza. We order from them all the time. They said they'd send out another correct one. We tipped the driver twice to make two trips - still they asked for the pizza they screwed up back as if we were trying to pull one on them. Can't just correct your mistakes? I worked for two very high volume pizza shops and we NEVER asked for the food we messed up back. People weren't trying to screw us. Just correct your mistakes."}
{"text":"Gionino's is our go to pizza place to have delivered to the house which is a must have for anyone. Always fresh and tasty food. The chicken BBQ pizza is out of this world as is their Mac and Cheese pizza. Their crust is different than most places, can't put my finger on it it fantastic. Whenever we have visitors we order from Gionino's and everyone always raves about their food. Highly recommended if you live in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"I order from the Westpark location. Food is all around good. Fried chicken and jojos are real good. Pizza is better then any chain. Personally like their white pizza. Good $h!t. If I gave one negative it's the chicken wings. They are ok and I eat them but it's just a fried wing tossed in franks. Very boring try making your own hot sauce!! I'd order here more if the wings were better."}
{"text":"Pizza that does not disappoint, been going there since it opened, pizza is very good. Chicken and jojo are better then KFC or Popeyes, and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"If you aspire to have a run-of-the-mill average pizza then Giannino's is your choice. We have tried their pies several times and it's usually burned and very heavy. Hudson has way too many pizzerias and This should not be one of them. #pass"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. They always have good deals going on and it's much better than any \"major\" chain pizza joint. I typically order pepperoni and bacon pizza and toppings are crispy and fresh, the sauce is good and bread is fresh and crispy. I also love their chessy bread(I forget the name of it) but it is a must have every time I order pizza here. I will order here about once a month and never disappointed"}
{"text":"What's not to like? Excellent sauce, delicious thicker crust baked perfectly.  Excellent, generous toppings and the most delicious sauce.   No denying that the pizza is wonderful.  And when you pick up the box, it has heft, so you're definitely getting a nice size pizza.  Price? A little high unless you use a coupon or get in on a daily deal, then it's within reason. I have stopped ordering from other places that are so expensive on topping prices that you have to tap into your IRA to pay. Gionino's has kept topping prices reasonable without sacrificing on quality. Kudos for that.  Chicken and jojo's are very good too.    Very nice people working there.  Always welcoming, polite and friendly.  Gionino's in Tallmadge definitely is my favorite spot for quality pizza and fried chicken.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I had never eaten from this neighborhood pizzeria before, but a Veteran came to my house selling coupon sheets for this place door-to-door for $25 (with all proceeds going to the Freedom House and Valor Home for Veterans.  I had my first from meal from here last night and it was amazingly perfect! The sauce was delicious and the doneness of the subs was exact and on point!  You now have a regular customer, Gionino's!"}
{"text":"I find that the best pizza usually comes from a small mom & pop shop.  I would say that this is one of the best chain pizza places I've tried."}
{"text":"This has got to be, hands down, the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I saw it posted on a note tacked to a wall at a gas cylinder refill site and made note of it.  I could have kicked myself for not ordering from them sooner.  Most delicious pizza ever in my opinion.  Wow, all i can say is try it and you'll know what I mean.  The antipasto salads are real good too as is the Italian chicken and jo-jho fries.  I don't believe there's one thing bad on the menu.  Call em at 330-722-2727 and know what great pizza is."}
{"text":"Not enough available stars to give to the Solon location.  Great, knowledgeable, professional, and polite staff lead by the most awesome owner-operator.  Always exceptional service and excellent food at a more than reasonable price.  Definitely the go to place for anything on the menu!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from here for take out ordered some barbecue wings and a small pepperoni pizza wings were good but the pizza was greasy or oily and you have to enter through the back of the store"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still open. I like the pizza and chicken but only when they answer the phone. I've called the Montrose location 3 times this year with no answer. I'm done even trying to order from them anymore. It's like they literally don't want business. If I was the owner I would be pissed. Leonardo's all the way!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! If you like thin crust pizza look elsewhere. I've been eating this pizza for over 15 years. Love it"}
{"text":"This would have more stars, but I'm not much of a pizza fan. This is the best pizza in the MOL area that I've tried. Their meatball subs aren't the best I've had, but they are pretty good. The Jojos are breaded potato wedges; they're ok, too. Also liked their cinnamon bread pizza. Their sauce has a nice flavor, not too tomato-y and not too sweet. Make sure to get the Mozzerella cheese added to the pizza for a small additional charge.   There are always coupons for Gionino's in Valpak, so give them a try."}
{"text":"Picked up a pepperoni pie instead of left over Mexican. The crust was crisp and on the thicker side. The pizza came bespeckled with silver dolar sized pepperoni. Overall it was a nice experience that I will repeat."}
{"text":"After having some old guy hang up on me because he couldn't find a coupon code. I called back and someone else made excuses for him. Gold clipper and market magazine coupons. The guy that was making excuses was worse than the old guy. I was a regular, not after this. I'll pay a couple dollars more and go to Fiesta"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  I've been pleased with the flavor, the amount of toppings, and the warmth of the pizza.  I've only had them deliver to the Holiday Inn across the street so I cannot comment on poor in-person customer service because people who've manned the phones and delivered my food were fine.  A little pricey, but no pizza place runs specials on a small pizza with a 20oz of soda (for the single traveler who hates leftovers)."}
{"text":"First pizza joint to deliver to our house without actually having to call 2-3 times during the delivery! That earned him an additional 5$ just because! Lots of great deals can be found on the Gold Clipper for this location, delivery for a Sat afternoon was about 45 mins so be prepared to wait, but the wait was worth it. Pizza nice and hot, and cheese and topping were as fresh as they get. Unfortunately that is all we tried, but looking forward to giving their wings a shot next go around."}
{"text":"Great taste in a new location. First time trying their pizza and it was really good and decently priced. They offer an online ordering system comparable to Pizza Hut which made the ordering process easy. I hate calling in orders as restaurants are always loud and orders can get messed up. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, subs, salad but overpriced for this area. $10 for medium? Same size is half that at Emidios, Rascissis and other places. Good pizza, not great pizza for the price. Get a brick oven pizza w fresher ingredients for same price."}
{"text":"20 minutes for two caprese sandwiches? By the way caprese is mozzarella tomatoes and basil NOT spinach. I don't understand...I just ate it. It was ok, I mean it made a turd and it was hot and crusty but the marinara was sweet and the basil was again non existent."}
{"text":"I LOVE their pizza, Slightly tangy sauce and very generous topping. Messy pizza just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Very polite young lady answered the phone, took my order, even told me I didn't need to bring in my coupon. The pizza was ready to go when I arrived and was delicious.  If this were my business I would offer  pizza by the slice all day, everyday- I think it's a untapped market in Hudson with all the teenagers downtown."}
{"text":"This is one of my new top five pizza places to get pizza I got the gionino's best pizza the pizza taste like it came right out a stone oven and the sauce taste homemade I most say I love when places take out the time and make good food"}
{"text":"Ok pizza not the same as the one in WVa but ok service was good pizza was hot little pricey"}
{"text":"Scary Bad. Bad pizza. Bad people. Comes burned unless you request otherwise! Refused to refund my money. Had to cancel credit card payment. This place cant go out of business fast enough for me."}
{"text":"Best pizza you'll find south of the city.  Always fast delivery and 15-20 minute carry out.  I get my pie a little well done and sprinkle some crushed red pepper and parmigiana on it to satisfy my taste. My go to pizza joint!!!  It never disappoints!!!  I also recommend them for their catering services.  I had them prepare enough food for a company event -- food arrived hot and on time for 200+ employees.  5 star items: Pizza, all their Pizza!!! Wings Marinated Italiano Fried Chicken Philly Steak Sub Italian Sub (Ask for hot peppers) Meatball Sub Garlic Bread w/ cheese!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this store in person, but had some pizza at the booth at Solon Home Days. My friend put this right up there with Ellio's (but for some freakish reason I love love love Ellio's so I found this a but insulting).  Pizza is so-so, sauce is rather sweet, thick crust of cheese. Ehh."}
{"text":"Hey you guys...  I'm tellin' you...I've been stuffin' my piehole with Gionino's since my days at Kent State and it's ALWAYS, ALWAYS been freaken DELISH!!!!! They also have a great menu with Jo-Jo's and broasted chicken and it's really well done.   I also believe they're cheaper than kfc or chicken whats their butt on Pearl? They're expensive and you don't even know if your getting chicken.... Notice that Cleveland isn't overrun by rats like NY or La? Hmmmm....Makes you wonder dudn't it...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thin crust pepperoni mushroom and jalapeño pizza in my particular neighborhood which is Northfield/Macedonia Ohio area. The service is always fast and the pizza is consistently excellent in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza but I have the pizza delivered and it is always a slow delivery time. Each time the driver calls and says their on their way but by the time I get it the pizza it is cold.  I won't order delivery again so I may not ever get their pizza again. Pizza is what I order when I don't want to cook or leave the house."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the Nordonia area. Good size. Toppings are ample and the taste is great."}
{"text":"The sauce has a fresh flavor a little sweet for my taste and the crust was soft. Now our pizza was under cooked so that may be part of it. The bottom of the dough was very doughy.  I liked the flavorful cheese and the pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  I will try it again and ask for them to cook it well done.  I will let you know."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here a half dozen times already, pizza is always very tasty and loaded with cheese, no need to order extra cheese like many places. Love the chicken and the jojo's, and everything has been made as ordered. They have always been on time, both delivered and pick-up. Can't find a fault to date, will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"This is typical of the local pizza parlors. Soft gooey dough that is much too thick to be considered New York Style, but no where near a Chicago Style.  Unfortunately there are only a handful of parlors that can turn this style of pizza into something I look forward to eating. Gionino's is not one of them. OK in a pinch or when noone else will deliver."}
{"text":"The only place in town with a real buffalo chicken pizza... No onions or sweet cheese sauce on it. Just perfect buffalo sauce, mozzarella and chicken on a delicious perfectly crispy crust. I always say I'll only eat a couple of peices, then black out and wake up covered in Buffalo sauce lying in the empty box. It's that good."}
{"text":"We get Gionino's frequently, normally without issue. Today we ordered Gionino's bread, it comes with marinara sauce. Today for some UNKNOWN reason, the sauce tasted and smelled STRONGLY of beer. I called to let them know and they said \"I don't know why it would\" and asked if we wanted them to bring us new. I'm sorry but to me that doesn't seem like a good solution, what you need to do is look into it further because there's absolutely no reason for beer to be in marinara sauce. This is a new level, not just upset customer that didn't like their food."}
{"text":"Order from here once every week or two. My order is always correct, food is good and the people have always been nice to interact with. Best pizza in the area if you want carry out."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last night for delivery. I clarified my address with the person who answered the phone, as sometimes people mistake \"blake\" for \"lake\". They said it would be an hour. After an hour and 15 minutes, I called to check on my order. The manager explained that the order had been entered as carry out, and had \"been sitting on his oven\". He said they would deliver the pizzas right away. I asked if they were giving me the pizzas that had been sitting on the oven, and the manager said yes, but assured me that they were still \"fresh and hot\". The pizza arrived about ten minutes later. The cheese pizza was warm, but my caprese pizza was stone cold. BUT the caprese pizza was delicious. I can only imagine how good it would have been fresh. Disappointed in my experience. I still tipped the driver a nice amount, but I wish the manager had tried harder to provide me with a better experience."}
{"text":"Love this pizza.....they are always friendly and the food is great! Yes people you will have to wait on a Friday or Saturday night bit it's well worth it! The delivery drivers are very pleasant as well!! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Delivery orders BEWARE! My review of this restaurant is as low as low can get. I rate this restaurant with a zero star, which is not possible.  My co-workers and I order food around 11am; the order estimated delivery time was 1 hour. The food arrived around 12:45 Pm and my order, which was a Philly Sub and JoJo's, was the only order not to arrive. I called the store and spoke with a rep and she advised that the driver would be on the way, which was around 1:10PM. I received my sandwich with no bag, just sitting in the open no one to record the delivery, etc. When I opened my box, SURPRISE!!! This sandwich look horrible and you would not feed it to an animal. I posted a picture of it just to show you words cannot describe how this sandwich looked. I do not recommend delivery ordering from here at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Doesn't beat my favorite Athens Pizza but definitely my second favorite in the West Park/Kamms Corner neighborhood. Prices are fair, staff is friendly, be prepared to wait a hour plus for delivery. Shop is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area hands down. I get the Popeye's pizza and no pizza anywhere compares. The jojos which im normally not a fan of are fantastic. The salads are large and well put together. All around best specialty pizza around!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a party and decided to order from this establishment... no one was impressed.. very greasy and just not that great overall.  I feel there are better pizza joints in Brunswick.. with that being said.. you might like it.. its not horrible or anything.. so I say.. give it a shot once and see what you think... kinda pricey too :("}
{"text":"some of the best pizza i have ever had. Price is average but the quality is superior! Fresh hot pizza delivered. Will buy again!"}
{"text":"Positives: They deliver and you can order online. Option to put basil on top and to choose if you want extra, light, or normal toppings. Negatives: Not worth the price. I paid $21 for a small build your own pizza with a cherry coke (this includes delivery and tip). When they say small, they really mean it. There is also too much sauce on the pizza. I felt like all I had was sauce (and I got the \"normal\" amount). Will definitely try a different pizza establishment next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Their white sauce pizzas and their Philly steak subs are amazing. Their crust is delicious, which is freshly made every morning. Fast delivery with a friendly, funny, and personable delivery driver Bubba. I have also picked up from Gioninos and the staff is so fun! They always say hello and ask how I'm doing. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order for a pepperoni pizza. The staff was very friendly and was apologetic for the phone issues they were experiencing. I was told it would be approximately 45 minutes. 45 minutes later, I received a call from this place asking me for my location, and 30 minutes later I called back asking for an ETA. 10 minutes later I received my pizza.   The pizza was absolutely delicious. Although I experienced some issues obtaining my order, it was well worth the wait.   I will definitely order from this place again. I wanted to give them 3 stars, but after some consideration, it would have been a bit unfair."}
{"text":"This is on top of my list for Local Pizza! The Antipasto Salad is a great start before eating a well made Pie!  The House dressing (sold in Large bottles) is a Family Favorite.  The dough is made in house and the ingredients are quality!  I used to frequent the Northfield Shop, when I was  near there.  Now, this is the place I go!"}
{"text":"It's in my top five of pizza place for sure. A pepperoni pizza that is best fresh and I can't say it's great cold or a day old. Try it with the garlic dipping sauce! The boneless wings are a huge hit in my family and we always have to order the gionino bread. Be prepared for them to be busy on the weekends so order an hour before you want to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza is good for ohio. I prefer NY style, so I am partial to all pizza unless it is NY style, which this is not. The garlic bread is awesome and wings are okay...not crispy enough."}
{"text":"Ordered a small Hawaiian pizza and order of teriyaki wings.  The pizza at Gionino's is ALWAYS wonderful!  Absolutely perfect and very tasty!  Wings were not so good - they were not crispy and were pretty unappealing.    Will definitely order pizza again....will get wings elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is our local pizza shop. It has a TON of competition in broadview hts for good Pizza and delivers great results every time. White sauce is amazing. Red sauce just slays the taste buds. I eat veg only at pizza shops and they have a lot of great options in their signature pies. Every time I order I get the same two delivery folks and they are always great despite my grumpy basset hound and two security doors.  Rare to see a chain that can compete with those insanely good mom & pop shops. Keep it going!"}
{"text":"YES! I am so happy to update this review with 5-stars. We finally ordered the right thing!  The Hawaiian pizza with added fresh mozzarella is THE BEST THING EVER. I'm not sure the measurements, but their large pizzas are l-a-r-g-e. Coupled with the addition of fresh mozzarella (+$4.00), this was the thickest, cheesiest pizza i've ever had. This was easily a million meals in one-- after one slice, I was full. I standby that if you're ordering from Gionino's go for a speciality pizza, not a plain one.   Overall, still 1 hour for delivery and a little pricey compared to other area choices. But when you can order easily online, can easily find coupons on their website and you receive a feedback form in your e-mail from them, these are all really good signs for me. We'll be ordering again!"}
{"text":"We are in Medina OH at a hotel, stopping overnight while traveling. We ordered pizza, salad and garlic bread. The food was fine, but delivery took 1 hour on a Sunday evening and they delivered to our room and brought 1 fork, no plates and no napkins."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery for the first time from Gionino's.  It was... fine... OK... but nothing special.  The pizza was OK, kind of your standard delivery pizza, but nothing special.  You have a choice on the wings of mild or hot, we got the mild, and they were kind of bland.  The salad was more \"OK, but nothing special\".  The delivery kid was nice, but it did take over an hour for a Saturday evening delivery.  If you need a pizza delivered in Hudson, its fine, but I don't get what people think is so great about it."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Close to home so I tried it once. Pizza was pretty good. I do not really have a complaint about it but there wasn't anything about it that had that wow factor. Prices were decent. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"Words can not even describe the horrible customer service that is the only memorable aspect of this place. My thirteen year old daughter ordered chicken and no one ever came to deliver it. Eventually the store closed and never bothered to call my daughter or anything. The next day my daughter called back hoping to be compensated for the chicken that never came and was astonishingly cussed out and accused of lying. Yes, they cussed out my thirteen year old daughter. Not only did they cuss her out, but they also threatened to fight her. My husband called back demanding to speak to a manager and was also cussed out and told to come into the store and fight them. The \"manager\", if you can even call her that, threatened to call the cops at which time my husband told her to send the cops to 142 F yourself Rd. I'm not surprised that this \"establishment\" has so many nasty reviews after the experience I have had. I don't recommend this place to anyone who wants to be treated like dirt or mediocre pizza. If it were possible to give this place less than one star I would in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Even though this is a huge regional chain, I expected their pizza to be better than national chains like Pizza Hut, Papa John's etc. but that's not the case. It's pretty much the same as all those. The dough tasted like it was mixed by an automated process and looked like it was shaped by a robot. Not much sauce, so you may need to order extra if you're into that. There are many high quality non-chain pizzerias in MOL and Mentor that I'd rather visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Customer service is fantastic and the food is always amazing. Try the Chicken Club Specialty pizza, it's absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza!! Best in town! Lots of options for pizza deals and other food. Definitely a must when your in Streetsboro."}
{"text":"excellent tasty Italian Pizza! best crust and dough in the area! add on some wings make it a party! fast and hot delivery right out of the oven freshness! must try it if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint that I was so happy to see come to Mentor. I had enjoyed Gionino's while in college near Canton and had not had it in years. When they opened the Mentor shop, I had to make a special stop to see if it was all I remembered. It did not disappoint. It tasted just like I remembered and with the lacking pizza options around MOTL I knew it would be a big hit and I could enjoy it for years to come. I highly recommend this place. Just go with the plain pepperoni pizza, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza here is one of my favorites around, and I'm so lucky it's right around the corner from me.    You can dine in if you want at the Third Place, but I always get it to go and pick it up in the back. The sauce is my favorite part - and the crust is perfect, a good middle between New York and Chicago style.  Ask for their large pizza special, 2 topping for 11.95!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town. Ask for them breaded with the sauce on the side. Juicy and pleasingly plump."}
{"text":"Great pizza had every pizza place in mentor this was my favorite what too try there jo jo fries and chicken next"}
{"text":"The chicken is decent and the pizza is among the best in this area, IMHO. For that reason, I will give a few stars. But I've found the customer service to be inconsistent, and usually lacking. My last experience - as in, I don't patronize the place anymore - was when I had received their VIP coupon in my email. I wanted to use it, but my printer was broken. The lady who answered the phone was pretty frosty about me asking if I could show the coupon on my phone, and insisted it had to be printed. It was for $2 off, or something like that, and apparently they were fine with losing a customer over that. It's their loss, since we order pizza just about every Friday. Judging from the other reviews, it's not just me - these folks just don't get it. Buh-bye."}
{"text":"So i have ordered from Teresas since i moved back out this way from cleveland. There were at least a dozen times teresas said they couldn't deliver to me cause they were too backed up or for whatever excuse. Then i remembered a place we used to order from when i worked at a shop out this way Gioninos. Did a quick web search and found they're open later on weekdays and weekends than teresas. Their prices are better on pretty much everything than teresas or at least equal and the food is better and they've NEVER messed up my order. Teresas had messed up a buncha my orders. Gioninos is a good 10min drive away from me whereas teresas is a 7min walk and Gioninos somehow managed to deliver faster or in equal time. If Gioninos started serving calzones id never buy anything from teresas ever again."}
{"text":"It's the bees knees. I love going here anytime I go back home to Cleveland, worth the drive from Avon Lake. Maybe they'll open a new location closer to 44012?"}
{"text":"Its decent pizza.. nice sauce..nice dough. ..but I didnt enjoy the sausage.   There is no wait staff inside..but there are like 6 tables and bottles of soda if you want to buy it and eat there.  Small place but decent prices. They have specials on Monday for a beat the clock special after 5pm. You pay what the time is for a large pizza. Try it on monday and see what you think."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing so is the staff and it is a great reflection on the owner.  He is excited to be a part of the community!  They have had fundraisers for scouts groups, the local MDA, the band and several other school organizations - they even give students with good grades pizza coupons.   What a great neighbor!"}
{"text":"Honestly the worse delivery ever. I ordered a small man n cheese and a small pizza with green peppers and onions. One item for tonight one for the next night. My mac n cheese showed up on a pizza which was weird but fine but my actual pizza? Sausage and onion. Im a vegetarian and I didnt look at the second pizza till I went to eat it the next day and saw meat on it. How do you confuse green peppers for meat. And how insulting to open your dinner and find meat on it. Everyones different and enjoys different food. Never ordering from here again- You shouldnt either theyll probably screw up your order as well. Extremely insulting and upsetting."}
{"text":"I am new to ohio and gioninos was my first pizza place that i chose .  the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly and very patient answering all my questions about the food and establishment.  the food is consistently on par and delivery staff is so cool !  i love this place !   i have tried other places but i still keep coming back to gioninos !   the food here is awesome !   P.S .  SUBS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD !!!!"}
{"text":"We took advantage of a coupon in a local circular and got both pizza and chicken, their two primary offerings. The large pizza was indeed large.  Maybe half again the size of a large Pizza Hut box. Pizza is a rather subjective topic.  I like enough sauce on the top that it enhances the flavor and moistness of the product.   Mr Gionino does not, apparently.  It tasted good, but when your product is basically dough and sauce, scrimping on the flavor/moistness half just doesn't cut it! It was double-cheese and pepperoni only, and the pepperoni was scattered accross the expanse of the pizza in a Scroogelike manner. Bite, bite, bite,... pepperoni!   One felt like \"winning\" a bite of pepperoni had similar odds to winning with a scratch off lottery ticket. That didn't help. The double cheese was indiscernable on the pizza, but not on the bill. The chicken on the other hand is quite flavorful as are the \"jo-jo\" potatoes, (coated deep-fried wedges.)  Both actually had herbs and seasonings in the batter, not just salt and pepper. The cole slaw was good but way overdressed.   One had to let it \"drip-out\" on one's fork for several moments before risking a bite in order to avoid wearing it. Cole slaw made ahead, needs to be shaken with salt and put in a colander in a sink for a while to weep out the excess moisture, and then squeezed by hand to remove some more, somebody is skipping steps. If you're feeding a boat load of teenagers, few or none of which are yours, the pizza is fine, 'cause there's a lot there, and they should be able to keep it down.   Otherwise, I'd drive just past Summit Mall on Ghent Rd. to Leonardo's where they offer great pizza (although their large is about 2/3 the size of Gionino's), and awful chicken.  Get the pizza at Leonardo's and get the chicken at Gionino's.   Both shops could learn something from their competitors. Pizza- 2 stars. Chicken- 4 stars. Average -3 stars. Take out only, no dine in."}
{"text":"This za is great.  We order it regularly and it is very consistent - in a good way.  A few thoughts- they put some sort of spice on it that adds a nice seasoning.  The pies are large and the amount of toppings is sufficient.  This is our go to place for pizza night.  An added bonus:  in the summer Freedom House comes thru the neighborhood and sells coupon pages for a tax deductible $20 donation.  Almost all the coupons are BOGO.  So for less than $20 you get two large pies.   Or, but a pizza and get 12 wings free.  Works out good for my family. 7/16/14- changed my review on account of a 2 bad experiences had at this place.  Pizza remains good but I will not be returning any time soon.  Good luck to you if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER!!  Their chicken is fantastic as are their boneless wings! Definitely my favorite pizza place!!  Only wish they took credit cards over the phone, I'd order more often!!"}
{"text":"Both the wings and pizza are excellent. If you are a breadstick/cheese stick fan the Gionino's bread is the best! I order it every time. Side salad is great also. Friendly service every time."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  I think they are way underrated.  I like them a lot better than Farinacci's, the area's reigning champs."}
{"text":"Ordered online. I have been here many times and it has never disappointed. I do enjoy tryi g many of there pizzas. My favorite is the pepperoni dipicalo.. The best meat, little kick to eat but nothing at all over powering.  The wings are good as well. The only reason I gave it a four star review is because of my last experience. We ordered extra crispy wings and the pizza. The pizza was spot on, however the wings not so much.. When we got home the wings were sitting in a puddle of sauce (which is not always a bad thing) but the wings were soggy and rubbery not cooked all the way through. The managment did a good job at a resolution. All other service has been good and the facility from what I can see is always clean and everybody there is friendly."}
{"text":"I feel that it is this particular Gionino's that has this problem. The pizza is already quite pricey and each topping is an additional charge so the total can add up quickly. The problem is there's literally NEVER any toppings! If I'm paying an extra almost 2 dollars for sausage my pizza should have more than 5 small sausage crumbles on the center of the pie. I also added banana peppers and I only had banana peppers and I am not joking I had three burnt rings on two slices of the pizza. Talk about MAJOR disappointment. The crust and sauce and cheese are great and always taste fresh but I shouldn't be eating a cheese pizza when I paid for toppings.   The twinsburg location is always loaded with toppings and is delicious this place has been disappointing every single time.   Another thing that I hate about this Gionino's is the time is takes for delivery. It's almost always cold by the time the pizza has come. My boyfriend loves the twinsburg location and we've tried now on three separate occasions to order from Solon location since it is very close and they deliver to the house but they have fallen short every single time. Now when we're craving pizza we take the extra 20 minutes to drive to twinsburg instead of ordering from Solon Gionino's.    I wish I had a picture of my dad depressing toppingless pizzas but I do not. If you're ordering a cheese pizza I'd say go for it. That can't be messed up but if you're looking for even a moderately topped pizza try your next option on your list."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and so cheap for what you get. We got a huge large mushroom pizza for under $12 + salad last night. Everything was delicious, no complaints. Love the dough. Tastes a lot better than some of the fast-food chain pizza places in the area.  Delivery was ahead of schedule based on estimate after I placed order online."}
{"text":"I like Gionino's. There are many who say it is the best. I don't think so. They ordered some for a work party. I have had Gionino's a few times prior to this and it is consistent. The pizza is extremely filling and one slice should do the job. My friend really hyped up the fried chicken. He is right, the recipe is really good."}
{"text":"Great pizza. $2 slice for lunch weekdays. Add a salad and a pop and you have lunch for like $5. They have a little area in front to sit and eat."}
{"text":"The best pizza and service I have found near work."}
{"text":"Wow.   Tried a regular pizza with sausage and mushroom, and a veggie, which comes with white sauce. Both were excellent. Delivery was more than prompt. Even the coleslaw was a treat.  Pizzas are greasy (which is a good thing), with a medium-thick crust. Toppings are abundant. I would prefer a bit more sauce and to have it spicier, but the cheese was just the right amount and the overall taste was great.  Coleslaw is chopped fine and just creamy enough, classic Chicago style.  We've tried a lot of pizza places around here, and this is our new favorite. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow, staying at the Hampton and ordered some pizza based on prior reviews.   Didn't disappoint!   Super good.  It took an hour but it's REAL pizza.   Wings were good too.  Friendly delivery to room."}
{"text":"As a transplant from the south, I have to say their fried chicken is better than most chicken places I've encountered in Ohio, and their pizza tastes truly homemade.  Love the Popeye with sausage! Also, JOJOS! If you're not familiar (I wasn't) they are thick, lightly fried, and very satisfying potato wedges.  Very pleased. We order from here about once per month."}
{"text":"We had Gioninos cater our shower last weekend and the food and price was favorable. A lot of people kept saying how good the food was. The girl who dropped everything off was nice as well. We decided to try their pizza tonight since we were so pleased with the catering. The delivery guy was super nice and although the pizza is a little greasier than I would like, I thought it was pretty tasty. We will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Wow, some of the best pizza I have had in along time! Seating area is very small, more geared toward pick up, but don't let that stop you. This place is a must if you are in the mood for pizza and in the area. Perfect combination of cheese and sauce, this review makes me want to order a pie now! I would challenge anyone to find a better pizza spot in northern OH."}
{"text":"I am a huge pizza fan, and have tried almost every pizza place in lake county, this pizza is hands down the best! The dough is homemade, the cheese is shredded fresh daily, and the toppings are excellent! I have not tried one item from the menu where I was not satisfied. They also have chicken here and it is fried in a henny penny, I have seen these on bar rescue and wondered what the difference is between a regular fryer and these, and it is so much juicier than a regular fryer. These fryers are also pressure cookers, which gets a great fry on the food without drying it out. This is my new pizza place! I suggest the gioninos best for pizza, philly sub, and any chicken, next im going to try the pastas!"}
{"text":"Love Gionino's pizza! This is my boyfriend and my favorite pizza spot. We always order the box of Jojos, Gionino's bread and pizza. It's all delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Finally, a place with good, yummy non-artificial cheese that isn't rubbery like other places (yes I'm lookin' at YOU Rubber City Pizza!) or sauce that's so sweet it's almost unbearable (this would be you, Romeo's!).  Nope, Gionino's just plain has it down.  We've ordered countless times several different items from these guys and the service and food are both always consistently good.  Our favorite as a couple is the regular ole cheese pizza, but my personal favorite is that w/tomatoes cooked under the cheese.  For some reason their ratio of cheese to sauce is just perfect.  We never have to request extra sauce like a lot of other places; they just know how to dish it up right without the special prodding.  Sometimes, you can get mozzarella sticks, but not at the Tallmadge location - try North Hill (on Tallmadge ave) if you want those.   We tried their subs tonight and I'm now in love with the chicken sub.  Tho weak on the lettuce (s'okay, I added some freshly sliced green peppers), it has a very generous amount of whole chicken breast, and tasty white sauce w/just the right amount of cheese.  My boyfriend got the meatball sub and was impressed.  The Jo's are okay - I like Fiesta better.   But the pizza and subs are just plain delish!    They are hands down, our favorite place to order from since we've been here."}
