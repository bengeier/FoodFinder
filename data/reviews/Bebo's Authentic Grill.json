{"text":"Wow! My wife and I stopped by on a business trip from Montreal and found this jewel of a restaurant. Family owned and operated! The food is absolutely authentic and fabulous! We will be back"}
{"text":"Best goulash and warm, inviting service. A true European gem in Etobicoke. Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. They make authentic pljeskavica and cevapi, served with tasty kajmak, just what I was missing after my adventure through the former Yugoslavian Republic. The restaurant owner greeted me and was very friendly, asking me about my trip to Bosnia and Croatia. He's actually a Serbian from Bosnia so this must be where the 'authentic' comes into play. Service was great and everything was clean. They have WiFi and there are several parking spots in front.  As for the food, it's more expensive than many other cheap eats in the area, but it does have a higher-end ambience and the food tastes better too. I do wish the meat were a bit juicier though, but the kajmak (sour cream) and ajvar (non-spicy red sauce) do make up for it. I also wish that they had a sommun (pita-like) or any soft wrap-type bread rather than the thick and inflexible bread they used.  They also serve more traditional diner favourites such as all-day breakfast and souvlaki. But go for the Balkan food."}
