{"text":"Always a wonderful meal, great service, one of our most favorite places! The flatbreads, salads and sandwiches are delicious! Staff will do all they can to make your dining experience a pleasurable event."}
{"text":"Great variety of food & wine. Their shrimp & grits are wonderful-fried grit cake instead of creamy grits. Staff is always friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is great! The food is delicious, crab cakes, salads, etc. And, of course there is a huge selection of some of the best tasting wines!!! Also, nice and clean."}
{"text":"Great wine selection. Food is  unexpectedly tasty and not too expensive. We usually get apps to share and a bottle of wine but the main dishes are great too.  I have also gone there for lunch on several occasions and the specials are great and not expensive at all.  I can't believe people actually spend more money to go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great place for small plates to share with a bottle of wine.  They have a good wine and beer selection that you can pick out off the shelf and drink at your table.  The wine bottle prices are much better than your average restaurant as they are not the typical 3x markup."}
{"text":"I have been to The Wine Shop for pairing dinners, special occasion and regular dinner night and have always enjoyed great service and excellent food!  Of course the wine and beer selections are amazing!  

I visited this past Sunday for brunch and was very excited to try the Bloody Mary bar.  I will admit I didn't think about the fact that they didn't have liquor and sake would be used for the Bloody Mary, which turned out pretty good.  That said the \"bar\"  was disappointing.  They had 3 jars with okra, string beans and asparagus that you picked out with a fork laying out.  Then a bowl with lemon and lime wedges, one with regular olives and another with bacon chunks.  There wasn't celery, cheese or meats like salami etc.  All the items had to be dumped in your glass because they didn't have any toothpicks.  

I would suggest not calling it a Bloody Mary bar and instead advertise they serve \"a\" Bloody Mary with a small topping table."}
{"text":"One of the nicest lunch spot in the area, large beer and wine selection.  Salmon salad was good but a bit over cooked."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The best beer selection in all of Steele Creek."}
{"text":"I Love this Place! I've gone multiple times with varying party sizes (2-10). My husband always orders the daily pasta and hasn't been disappointed yet. For me it's always the flatbread pizza. They make individual size pizza's that look and taste just like the ones in Italy. The cheese topping is the best we have had in town. I'm a little surprised by the waiter comments as every time we've come (and that is many) we have always had good service. My one and only complaint is seating. There is a very small booth area and a larger bar (very high stools and tables) area. I'm short and the tall tables are uncomfortable. Other than that I high recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wine selection was very good.  Food was adequate.  Service was OK.  Tables were dirty.  The young lady working the door, inexperienced and not very accommodating.  The tongue ring...... come on not appealing."}
{"text":"Pretty salty prices especially for wines by the glass-really good food but could use more California reds with quality such as J, Rombauer zin' mauritson zin, B.R. Cohn, etc. Not a huge California selection but good none the less"}
{"text":"I would recommend the steamed clams and Annalisa Sparkling Moscato. The pair are absolutely delicious! The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing."}
{"text":"This restaurant was way better than I expected! I had the house burger and my husband had the Rueben. Both amazing!! My husband is a huge fan of Rueben's and said this was the best one he's ever had. They have an excellent wine and beer selection. You can simply browse their selection and take what you want and your server will just add it to the tab and bring you a chilled glass. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to checking this place out. But overall I felt like a excited kid on Christmas morning only to get an ugly Christmas sweater. 

There was only a handful of us and took us about 10 minutes before we got any service and it wasn't great service. 

The wine was ok but I felt it was a bit overpriced.  The wine we did have was decent. 

The only plus side was the huge selection of craft beers and wine."}
{"text":"Went to the Wine Shop last night, party of 7 and very disappointed. We have gone here for years and this night the food was terrible. Not very busy and yet it was slow. Our sandwiches were nothing but bread. Pasta tasted like they had opened a jar of pasta and cold. Our waiter tried to make things better but even went they sent replacement dishes out it wasn't any better. We all left hungry. The manager or assistant manager never even came out of address the problems."}
{"text":"Best place around.  I always stop in for a visit while in town.  Love the food, wine & beer selection.  In addition, the staff are experts in pairings and helping with selections."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent selection of wines. The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please. Always ask about the specials, and their wine dinners are always great."}
{"text":"Love this place. It can be a bit pricey but since it's pretty much the only nice wine, food and craft beer place around Steele Creek they can do that. The wait staff are stellar, they truly make this place enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very nice place. I ordered a special wine and they got it the next day. Very impressive."}
{"text":"I owe The Wine Shop an update. 

I live near by. My wife and I frequent this place and since this experience some time ago - seaming like ancient history.They have really stepped up their game. The food is quality and the staff has been significantly upgraded over the years. I have no problem telling you now that they know who we are and take VERY good care of us every time we come in. In all it's made for a consistent choice for an every week way to have good meal and a great glass of wine or beer. 

Beyond the fact I think their response to my initial review was very  disappointing....

I would actually update to give them 5 stars if they just had more vegetarian / vegan choices for my wife AND they offered the tacos all day ;-)"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.
We have had rations here a few times - house burger with truffle fries, salmon eggs benedict to name a couple.  Food is decent.  Loved the truffle fries.  Check your plates.  We found them to have food underneath and on the side.  Not old but probably transferred from someone else's meal.  

They usually have 5 to 7 craft brews and about 48 wines on tap. Yes, wine on tap no boxes here! Their beer selection is impressive and can be consumed on site or to go for $2 more. They also have growlers to go, WHATTT!?! Wine selection is exceptional!!!!!!

They have wine tastings on Saturdays and brunch on Sundays. Pay attention to the menu as there are certain times when food is served before and after. They have an upstairs sitting area that can be rented out as well for parties.  (Just discovered that on a whim, not well advertised.) Overall, great staff.  I think often they are over staffed with employees hanging 4 and 5 deep behind the bar creating small talk amongst each other."}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss here.  I either have a really enjoyable experience or a really shitty one.  Today the double charged me for a bottle of wine.  Hesitant to shop here because the outcomes are stochastic. *sigh*"}
{"text":"High hopes were dashed on two visits.  On March 29th and 30th (back to back nights) I stopped here with friends and both times was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait even though there were open tables.  The first night we left and went to The Casual Pint and had a blast.  The second night I offered up advice to the hostesses that they could have offered us seats outside (we are from Chicago and not bothered much by 50 degrees), a drink menu and we would have likely killed 20 minutes just browsing the wine selection.  So again, we went to The Casual Pint and again had a blast.  If I ever actually get to try this place, I will update my review.  Until then, I'm perfectly satisfied with making The Casual Pint my weekly go-to drink and food spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great waitstaff, and good wine for reasonable prices.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The wine suggested by the wait staff was delicious. I ordered a entree. The salmon was piping hot and cooked to perfection, however the sides were cold. The starch of the day was mashed potatoes and the veggie of the day was broccoli both served ice cold. The wait staff did leave some to be desired with the service, there were times where I waited a while just for another glass. When you think wine shop, you think ready to pour, not so much here. But I'd definitely stop in again perhaps it will be better. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE..... they have the freshest food there. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fresh mozzarella, and when is say fresh i mean fresh and the wine selections are out of this world. The prices are reasonable and the staff really know what they are doing. In my opinion its something that you would think to find in a strip mall ..... I will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 star. The waitress was rude, she did not give us any attention. After her rudeness and waiting for 45 mins, we asked how long more for our food  to come out, and she said \" your food take longer than regular food to cook\". Thats fine waiting a little more for the food to cook right. However she came back after 5 mins and said \" your food come to the wrong table and we need to cook it again.\" No apology ? Really ?  The service is that bad at a popular restaurant like the Wine Shop ?? At this point, we just walked away"}
{"text":"In town for the night and pulled out Yelp. Thanks. We had a cheese plate, pan seared scallops, calamari, seared tuna. Four plates. Four home runs. The wait staff was great. This is a good, no rush, take your time and enjoy type place. I wish we had a place like this closer to home. All in all a really good dinning experience"}
{"text":"Love this little spot in Steele Creek. Great chef-driven menu out here in the burbs. Wine pours are a little short, but we can deal with that because the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Great wine selection, cheese plate was great, service was fantastic! One of the best restaurants in this area! Great job Wine shop!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food the wine and the servers! A nice place to meet friends and enjoy a couple of hours."}
{"text":"What happened? I used to go here 2-3 times a week and always had great service and food. Today went and sandwich was so small finished it in 6 bites was appetizer sized. The great truffle fires were undercooked and way over salted and I like salt but these were white with salt. Used to know 3/4 of waitress s all different staff which were on cell phones and talking to friends! What happened was there a management change if so there needs to be another one soon! Has severely gone downhill!"}
{"text":"I would love to give them more stars as there food is really good but I think i went there on the wrong day. They simply had bad luck i think. We ordered a cheese plate and it came out with a long dark hair across all the cheese. They did quickly take away the cheese and get us a new plate. My fiance ordered a fish plate and it was amazing. I ordered the rack of lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out completely raw. It was so raw that my steak knife could not cut into it. The chef came out an agreed that it was raw and was trying to explain to me why. long story short I dont care its raw. He told me that it would take some time to get another order out. As my fiance was almost finished with her meal I said no and just ordered an italian sandwich. The sandwich was unreal. the fries were unreal and the cold cuts in the sandwich were some of the best Ive had since I moved from Boston. The chef actually felt bad about the rack of lamb that he sent me a to go box with the rack of lamp i think to prove that it really is good and wanted me to try it as he felt bad i had to order something else. He was right. When it is cooked properly they probably have the best rack of lamb ive ever had. So in short they had a bad night but the service was amazing. great beer and wine selection and the food when cooked properly is out of this world."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and tasty food. A nice selection of bottles to purchase."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and fun food!

Really great to see/hear  my good friend Tommy Joy!"}
{"text":"I live right near this place and I've never, ever been disappointed. The cooks know how to cook! The paninis are my favorite. I love the salmon BLT and Italian. The salads are amazing as well. Great wine selection, the wine guy knows what he's doing. Everyone seems in good humor and even when it's busy there's a nice energy. Also, really good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Great atmosphere! Great service! It's a wonderful lunch spot. And brunch is epic. I recommend the chicken pesto panini, the calamari, and brunch wise the omelets and shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"Do not go here for brunch. I absolutely love their regular menu. It's a shame they don't apply the same attention to their brunch menu. Pretty basic and not very well prepared. Really really terrible coffe that tasted like it was from my works nasty coffee machine. They need to have a french press and some signature dish. The eggs Benedict was bland and lm not sure they toasted the English muffin. The ham was even odd. I ordered the muffin as a side and serioulsy spit it out. I was told it was blueberry but it defiantly wasn't. Stick to there regular menu."}
{"text":"Since I live close by this is a place I frequent.  It is a wine shop and restaurant that is a great place for lunch or a casual dinner.  The food is excellent.  I love the calamari, and their sandwiches and daily specials are wonderful.  Service is usually good.  When the weather is nice, you have the option of inside or patio seating, and once in a while they will even have live music."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  When my husband and I met the owner, we were delighted and couldn't wait to try out their brunch.  However, when we came there to dine, the nice owner wasn't there and our waiter was horrible.  He didn't give us a menu until 20 minutes after we were seated and was grumpy and rude.  I think he was probably hung over.  The food was forgettable, but the bad service wasn't!"}
{"text":"Went in to see what it was about. Love that you have the option to taste the wine before you order the glass or bottle. Sat at the bar. Great service. Ended up having 2 appetizers. The clams and the muscles in the blue cheese sauce.  Amazing. Wine we chose were 2 different Reds. The staff was very knowledgeable about the drink selection. To top it off. FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE. the BEST THING any person who has Celiac Disease can see on the menu! And it was amazing!!! 
They had so many delicious things on the menu and even a brunch. Will DEFINITELY be going back. 
Maybe even today actually.  They have a patio section since the inside is not so big, but it was too chilly to sit outside that night."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and has 5 stars all around.  I came here to get a nice glass of wine and wait for my family to finish shopping.  Little did I know there was a little chef in the back of the kitchen making mouth watering food.  I tried the mussels and the flat bread!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it is nice and relaxing inside, and out. The people there are friendly and fairly attentive. Their beer selection is fenom .   I feel their wine selection could be better and I feel some of their pricing is a bit off. First time I went I paid $30 for an entire bottle of Nadia Cabernet on a Saturday night.  I came in a week later and just ordered a glass of it on a Wednesday afternoon and it was $19 and when I say a glass of wine, the pour was as much as you would get in a tasting....I was shocked and asked, is this a full glass of wine? The tender said  YEP.  I was a bartender in fine dining establishments for 20 years and I know what a tasting sample and a glass of wine is supposed to look like. With that said if I'm ever back in the area I might stop in but I wouldn't go out of my way to purposely go there spinning the wheel of pricing and the questionable pours."}
{"text":"The Moscato was really good and so were the fries. I got the house burger and was not impressed. The burger had no seasoning what so ever so it made it very bland. My husband had the quiche of the day and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My sister's new year resolution is to become an alcoholic by the end of 2013. So she thought this is a great place to start some day drinking. This is my 2nd time here. So far, everything is good. I had their steak and eggs last time I was there for brunch. I enjoyed it. This time, my sister ordered a glass of moscato which is typical of her. She loved it. I ordered a chocolate flavor red wine because I love red wine and chocolate. Great combination right?!! It was good for me for the 1st half of the glass. After that it was a bit too sweet and the chocolate after taste sets in. I'm not sure because I had the crab cakes and it didn't sit well together but I was done with that glass quick. Customer service was great. She was very knowledge with the wine list and check up on us often. I will go back."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great wine! But it was a little chilly because all the tables are by the door. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"When we were seated, the place was very empty. It never filled up but a large party came in after us. We ordered our food and waited and waited and waited. The waitress never checked on us or let us know what was going on with our food. We had other business to attend to during lunch hour but couldn't because we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food! This is ridiculous for lunchtime. When we asked what was going on, they told us our food was after the large party. I think there was a mix up but all we got was a \"Sorry\". Definitely lacking a customer first attitude. If they food had been worth it that would be one thing, but it wasn't. The special quiche was bland and disappointing. The salmon sandwich was also bland and disappointing; it needed some sort of sauce or livening up. The truffle fries were good. Everything lacked seasoning and salt. Our table didn't have any salt (and of course the waitress didn't ask if we needed anything until we were almost done eating.) The grinders/ salt shakers were so clogged we couldn't even get the salt out. Normally I wouldn't complain about piddly things like that but the whole experience was just so annoying at that point. We had to rush through our food and beg for the check to finally escape! Usually an experience like this ends with some token of apology so that you'll feel good about giving them another try but nada. Phew! We will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were invited to this place by some fellow beer lovers, and we were not disappointed. The Wine Shop is located in a fairly busy shopping center, easy to miss if you don't know what you are looking for.

A nice little wine shop with decent beer selection. There is a small bar with about three taps, and a fairly decent bottle selection. I did not try the food, but was impressed with the overall atmosphere of the place. The waitstaff was fairly attentive, and informative. We will definately be back when we are able to try the menu along with a good beer."}
{"text":"I love everything- cheese plate, wraps, sandwiches and specials. They do such a fantastic job, the wine/beer prices are good and the service is fantastic. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and wine! And the prices aren't bad either. Definitely going back! I had the truffle fries and the Mediterranean wrap. Both were great but the truffle fries are a must have!"}
{"text":"Our second time. Staff friendly, has inside and outside seating. Great selection of wines, 45 by glass over a 1000 by bottle.
Great selection of food, quiche is good, hummus and cheese plate good. They do serve red meat for burger lovers."}
{"text":"My husband, myself and my 4 yr old daughter decided to walk over from the store I manage in Rivergate and have a nice dinner at the Wine Shop. We originally wanted to sit outside but no tables were available. No biggie, we sat at a low top inside. We were sat in between 2 occupied tables. The same waitress for all 3 tables. Once we were sat, our waitress approached both tables on either side of us but completely ignored us. When she finally got around to our table, she said I'll bring you all some water. (What if I don't want water!) My husband quickly spoke up and said can you tell what beers are on tap? She said, we have hundreds... Just stand up and go over to the beer area and grab what you want. He said, but do you have a list of what you have on TAP? She said, uhhh yeah and rattled them off as fast as she could and was gone. 

I understand being busy.. A simple greeting and smile would have stopped the clock and made us feel welcome. Especially when she is being semi attentive to everyone else around us. 

Needless to say, we took our business to River Bleu. We sat outside and our waitress was absolutely amazing. We tipped her very well and will steer clear of The Wine Shop. 

I'm in the service industry and you can't expect people to pay more for less... Period."}
{"text":"Awesome place, if you like wine they have an awesome selection, nice bar area. 
They have a very decent selection of craft beer but after paying attention the third time I was there I found out they charge $2 plus corkage on each bottle of beer, the beer price before that is about market but add on another $2 and it's crazy.  If they don't want to sell beer in house they shouldn't."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service. Great wine selections. I love the cheese with the balsamic reduction and toast.  This is a great restaurant to meet friends in, but if you are looking for something manly and hearty, it's not for you.  They make great fresh light provencial meals. I go crazy for it, but my husband grones at the mention of it.  He wants his steak and burgers."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The idea of having a place like this in our neighborhood is great so I wanted to support it.  I gave it several chances, dining there on a few separate occasions for brunch and dinner.  Nearly every time, my company and I came away a bit disappointed.  

It looks like a nice place, and when you sit down at a table it feels like a nice place.  But the wildly inconsistent service really has a negative impact on the experience here.  The food is okay and in fact we really enjoyed our brunch.  They have live music occasionally which is a nice touch.

There have been too many disappointing and inconsistent experiences here for me, and it's unfortunate because I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day is nothing but a way for restaurants to take a huge bite out of your wallet. I called the Wine Shop in Rivergate to make reservations  for tonight. The lady said that I have to order off of the Valentine's Day menu. All we wanted was a light dinner and a wine for her and a beer for me. Such BS"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday on a Tuesday night. Lovely place! Had a live pianist on a TUESDAY which was really nice and not something I'm used to seeing."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I'm quickly becoming a regular here. The house burger is amazing!!!! You can't go wrong pairing it with the truffle fries with goat cheese! Mmmmm..... Last night I had the house salad with champagne vinaigrette which was spot on.  
Also, they have an ever changing selection of craft beers on tap which is the topping on the cake in my opinion! 
The only negative is the amount of tables they cram in there."}
{"text":"Really nice place for river gate. Small selection on the flight menu. Food is reasonably priced and portioned. Wished they had more selections to pair with the wine. Not your traditional wine bar. Well light with restaurant/bar seating instead of your normal darker more lounge seating in a wine bar. At any rate, it's somewhere to go other than hickory tavern in Steele creek!"}
{"text":"Overall a great dining experience. The food was good, served quickly and to order. For a wine shop, they have lots of options from the standard meats and cheeses to burgers and entrees. Wines by the glass menu is fairly large, with options of taste, flight and glasses size options. Nice inside seating along with an outdoor patio. The weather kept us from sitting outside."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! We came for lunch and got, naturally, a bottle of wine. Pinot Grigio since it was a little warmer out a few days ago. We had an awesome time and Joe, our server was amazing. This was our first time here and we can't wait to come back next week."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today, around 2 pm. Fairly empty.  It's been a while since our last visit, but the staff remembered us and treated us in a very welcoming style. Had the Reuben  with a nice side salad. My wife had the Ahi tuna coated with sesame seeds. A large, tasty portion for only $9.50. Good food, reasonably priced and friendly efficient service."}
{"text":"It had been a loooong time since the fella and I came here, and our last experience wasn't that awesome, but we decided to give it another try... and I'm so glad we did!

It was hoppin' on a Wednesday night at 8:00, and we got the only available table inside - even the bar was packed. We were promptly seated and waited on, and we each got a glass of wine to start. For dinner, I went with the fig, prosciutto, and gorgonzola flatbread ($9.99) and the fella got the cast iron salmon with fingerling potatoes and veggies ($16). He's a little bit of a salmon snob, and he ate the whole thing. I had only planned on eating half my flatbread, and I ate the whole thing. Clean plate club all around! 

We each got a second glass of wine and relaxed a little after dinner, and our waitress couldn't have been more pleasant. The total bill was $62 for two entrees and four glasses of wine - not too shabby."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. The servers / bartenders have always been great for us.

We tend to come here for either an afternoon or early evening spot, before having dinner (having a few apps and wine there). We love sitting outside (weather permitting), sharing a bottle of wine, and sometimes food. Their wine options are fantastic, and not overpriced, either.

While I haven't had a lot of their food options, I have had a few. (truffle fries, cheese plates, pizza, calamari etc).

I would definitely recommend this spot to someone who wants to find a great local wine shop! (Free wine tastings on Saturday afternoons, as well!)"}
{"text":"We were in town from Georgia and had planned for brunch here for the weekend with our friends. The brunch menu looked amazing and we were excited to try. Walked in the door, hostess has just say the last low table. We had our 2 year old with us who can sit at a low table with a seat or high chair, but not a high top, that's dangerous. The hostess asked if we could sit at a high top. Really? The hostess refused to ask the young group that just sat to switch with us for a high top. She wouldn't even ask! there were more high chairs against the wall than there were low tables. We had to leave and go elsewhere. We will not be giving our business here or any other branches. Find a more accommodating hostess and table setup! You missed out on a lot of money today and here on out."}
{"text":"Great food and wines, 1 star because the waitress Tiffany was not friendly at all and seemed bothered by every question. If you don't enjoy your job then you need to resign my friend ! 
Go there for the food and wine but if Tiffany is your waitress it's not going to be fun, you better know what you want"}
{"text":"I love the Wine shop! My husband and I have been there for wine dinners and had a wonderful time with excellent food, we have sat at the bar and had charcuterie and wine which was always excellent and today I had a wonderful lunch with a girlfriend. Our wait staff was excellent, a mom training her daughter and they both did a great job. We split the salmon salad and shared a delicious flatbread that was so big we took half of it home. That half of a salmon salad was so generous I think we were both quite full from just that. We had a lovely time at one of my favorite places that's close to home. Check it out next time you are near Rivergate!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last Saturday, and the food was pretty good. I had a Salmon BLT with a side of fruit. The interior was alright, the service was average, the food was good. It wasn't anything superbly impressive, but a good place to have lunch. Nothing stood out to me but nothing made me decide not to come here a second time either. Meh."}
{"text":"I have been to this place so many times with amazing service. Tonight was an exception. The food was brought to us from a food runner.  After waiting 12 minutes Without my waitress returning to ask us if everything was okay. I simply asked a manager for some ranch that my partner was waiting on for his meal. The manager apologized and brought the ranch. Then he came around and said \" I reviewed the tape and my server has been around numerous times to check on you. So, I simply said so you're calling me a liar. He said well, I reviewed the camera and yes she has checked back in with the two of you and you both were in deep conversation. My mother raised me right, so if someone speaks I answer no matter how deep the conversation. He said, so is there anything else I can get for you? Yes the check please, since I have never been so disrespected in my life. I work in customer service myself and when a customer complains, I take it as a learning opportunity and not personal. I will always accept positive and negative feedback without taking anything personal. Being a manager for a major company, I'm always looking for feedback on my people to help them and myself grow. It's unfortunate that this manager took it so personal and called his returning customer a liar. I will never be back nor would I recommend this place to anyone. It is clear to me after tonight's experience that they don't care about paying customers but more about the employee."}
{"text":"A #1 as always! Never a bad meal here folks. Today's lamb and white bean soup was smashing! The angus burger prepared like a Cuban sandwich with pork, ham, pickles, cheese and mustard was 2 nd to none!"}
{"text":"The food and wine were great. The space is very small and they only have three low-top tables indoors. Personally, I wish it were in a larger space. But if you come during non rush hours it;s probably fine."}
{"text":"This weekend we had a Bridal Shower - Upstairs - In the Private Room at The Wine Shop. Jon Sheesley , the Manager had talked with me a couple of times over the last three months and helped me plan and execute the MOST fantastic shower! . We also had a waiter who was so helpful and knowledgeable - Rich Williams ( I would ask for him if you were in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, we had Crab Cakes, Tuna Tartare in little Cones, Flatbreads, Brushettas, and Calamari!  We were allowed to decorate the tables and bring in our own added touches. I would highly recommend this for any event you would need a private room for. They can hold up to 35 or 40, we had 26 and were quite comfortable. It is consistently good as a wine shop and now we know its great as a private venue also!! Kudo's to Jon and Rich!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it rocks, the food is amazing , the staff is super friendly. Their cheese and meat plates are way better than other wine shops in the area. I'm a bit of a food snob and don't do chain restaurants also being from south Florida finding decent places to eat around here is pretty difficult ... so in my eyes this place is awesome...."}
{"text":"Superb food wine and staff. It does not get better than this. Leave the children at home. Great music when Peaches plays"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner.  This place is pretty cute,  it doesn't have a whole lot of tables because of the wine in there.  But the concept of wine on taps was pretty cool.  The food was good,  I loved the garlic fires,  they were pretty delicious.  The prices were on the moderate side which was good..."}
{"text":"Love the wine shop! The variety of wine and the descriptions that accompany them are wonderful. I LOVE that we can choose between a taste/flight/glass. So far we've made 3 visits. 2 of the 3 we've had a very knowledgeable server that also helped recommend wines for purchase in their shop (not on the menu) based on our preferences. All 3 times service was quick and friendly. Can not wait to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loveee this place! Service here is awesome and very kid friendly. The waitress was so sweet to keep my two year old occupied while we look through our menu. I come here because their bottle of wine is cheap, cured meats are great and along with the wonderful cheeses!"}
{"text":"I love the wine shop! So cozy inside & such a perfect place for gatherings or just meeting a Frien for lunch or dinner. 
Food is excellent!
Don't forget to just go!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here twice. The first time was for some wine and cheese one night. The other time my boyfriend and I came here for brunch. It was pretty delicious, however the food was a little cold, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars. I will defiantly be back to try brunch again, as well as dinner one night. The waitstaff is super nice, and they really know what there talking about as as far as wine pairing goes."}
{"text":"Oh, I'm in love! I've found my new secret spot. The service is awesome, the wine is perfect and the food is \"the bomb.com\" Lol! Keep up the good work. :-)"}
{"text":"Great, great, great. So many wines to choose from & staff make great recommendations based on what you tell them you like. 
The food is always good. Also love that the menu does change and specials have always been good. 
Not just a great wine place but also a good variety of beers. 
Great place to get just a quick glass, bottle or a meal. 
You won't go wrong for a great meal, date or bringing family for a great local place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I've passed by this place for 3 years and never stopped by. Pleasantly surprised and glad I did. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch for the first time today at the Wine Shop. I normally try new places based on Yelp reviews and ratings. I eat lunch out every day and try new places every week. Yelp reviewers are normally very accurate in rating local restaurants. I tried the lunch special which was oyster tacos (I know!!) but this dish combined my love for mexican and fried oysters. The food was excellent, but the service was really really bad. The waitresses stand around talking to each other instead of waiting on patrons. They really need a new manager in the  dining room.  Countless Yelp reviews have tried to provide honest feedback to help this place improve but no one seems to be paying attention!"}
{"text":"Ahh! My third time visiting, I enjoy coming to The Wine Shop. Conveniently located near my house I can swing by anytime! The food & Service is superb!! Reservations are available. The upstairs is rather small, but plenty of elbow room to move. The first level is another story, you have to squeeze around the tables. I wouldn't recommend sitting near the front door there's a draft. 

Food:
I love the truffle fries...So delicious!! One of other favorites, The Lightly fried calamari and Crab Cakes!! Both come with a spicy remoulade! You'll love it!! I occasionally dream about it!! Hahah!! I wouldn't recommend ordering the margarita pizza. The White Pizza is definitely a better choice!!! Comes with chicken, mozzarella, feta, and oregano.
 
Parking isn't that great. Depending on the time of day you'll have to circle around to find something. They also offer Brunch. So I definitely need to swing by."}
{"text":"I have to say, for being a regular customer since I moved here over a year ago now, today was a disappointment-on top of everything it's my birthday. 

My husband and I decided that out of all the brunch places in Charlotte we decided to celebrate here. Upon arrival, no one opened the door like they usually do. When we walked in, only two out of ten or so tables had people at them. Since the Panthers game was on, and the woman that plays music on the keyboard was presently doing so we chose to sit inside instead of outside like our usual. All the open tables were dirty, so while the staff was cleaning some up, I went to check out there vast drink selection for the umpteenth time (not a bad thing I'll add).
Once we were seated and ordered our drinks, mimosas and waters, the waitress never asked for our ID's, neither mine nor my husbands, maybe then she would've noticed it was supposed to be a celebration. The whole time we were there, she never once refilled said beverages. Neither the adult kind, or just the simple H2O. The brunch we each ordered, salmon eggs benedict and spinach rock-a-feller pizza, came out after two other tables came in and their orders were ordered, and delivered (just saying-everyone knows we notice this, and don't enjoy it).
By the time I was done eating my meal and had at least 1/2 left, looking to take home left overs, and my husband was hunting for a check, our waitress was busy chatting up her only other table that wasn't even done eating, for no less than 10 min, no exaggeration. We ended up asking another waitress for a to-go container and the bill. She got both, our waitress kept chatting. 
To say we were frustrated by the end of our visit was an understatement. The food was great, as usual, the service unfortunately left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I'm new to the city so I'm traveling around trying different eateries. The Wine Shop was a suggested restaurant & once I saw outside seating i knew I could relax & unwind. 
I started with the Hill Family red blend ~ deep, dark & dry ~ I had 4 glasses. The crab cakes are perfect in taste & portion. The 2 crab cakes were small enough to eat both while leaving room for an additional appetizer. I also had the flatbread chicken & spinach pizza ~ the flatbread could've been cooked a little longer but nonetheless it was delicious. 

I also had a glass of a honey Chardonnay. I love red blends but the Honey Chardonnay May have to be a new edition to my personal winery. 

I met some newlyweds who actually sat & ate with me. It was an afternoon of meeting new people that turned into an evening of laughter & toasts to the future."}
{"text":"The wine shop is quickly becoming one of my favorite destinations for dinner in my new area. The indoor area is warm and cozy and I cannot wait to use the outdoor when the weather improves.

Obviously one of my favorite aspects about this restaurant is the wine. It isn't just the selection but also the fact that if you order wine by the glass they will bring out a sample of an ounce or two to be sure you like it before committing. They bring even more beer if you want a sample! 

Everything I have sampled so far has been delicious and it has the flexibility to be a destination for a nice dinner out or a casual tapas night. Or just a place to stop by a purchase a bottle of wine while you are out shopping! Definitely check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great! Service not so much, the women I ordered with both had attitude for no reason and weren't very easy to order with."}
{"text":"We have been here countless times and loved it. But tonight, even thought the food was decent, we encountered very uptight and inefficient staff. The hostess was very defensive- had an answer for everything. She would not put two tables together anywhere and claimed that every place that had two empty tables was a fire hazard if she put them together. I think she was just lazy as there was clearly no way for it to be a hazard. Every area allowed plenty of room to walk past. The staff freaked out over everything. Our youngest child has food allergies, and we often take food with us for her. They have let us do this here my  times before. But all of a sudden, tonight, it was the biggest issue. The girl actually told us it was a \" health hazard\" for the child to eat outside food at one table but not at our table. What? Does not make sense. I think they were just unhappy with us for suggesting efficient ways to seat us. Our waitress was not terribly friendly either.
We will try again as this is the first time we encountered trouble. Hopefully they will fire and rehire more competent staff by the time we go again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have an awesome beer and wine selection.  I have never tried anything there was wasn't good.  The best thing I have tried there is their blue cheese chicken salad, I have never had anything like it and it is really good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how big the menu was, I expected bar bites but there is a full on menu with reasonable prices.  The truffle goat cheese fries are great, the ahi tuna is delish (the sauce has a pinch of wasabi in it), the flat breads are more like personal sized pizzas rather than the traditional flat breads that I was expecting.  The cheese plate presentation is a bit odd.  I ordered 2 cheeses and 2 meats and it came on a large, square plate with 4 individual plates within in the larger 1.  There was tzatziki sauce with it, place oddly on top of 1 of the smaller plates...no crackers???  The waitress did bring out focaccia bread (which was good by the way) & oil but I don't believe that was for the cheese plate as I saw everyone getting that bread bowl.  I was expecting crackers and a cheese board rather than this oddly large platter.  Planet Oregon wine is GOOD GOOD GOOD!  We bought a bottle home with us!  

Our waitress Jordan was polite and VERY knowledgeable...attentive too!  My husband and I went for dinner around 7:30 on a Saturday and was told that the wait was 30 mins. we opted to sit at the bar (which is fine with us, we usually find our way to the bar eventually anyway! :)).  We noticed that the crowd started to die down about 8:30, 9 (note to self in case we come with a larger party and need a table).  This place is basically in our backyard, I expect to be here a lot during patio season!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in to this amazing place Friday night, accidentally. After receiving bad customer service at a neighboring bar, we stopped by The Wine Shop for a refreshing beverage. The place was busy, clean, and most importantly, welcoming. Bar staff greeted us in a timely manner. They have a great selection of wine behind the bar, but additionally an array of craft beers in the coolers that customers can enjoy; reasonably priced. After our experience, we were puzzled in regard to why we hadn't visited The Wine Shop earlier. Staff was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive. We will definitely be back, and recommend to our friends. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but IMO this restaurant has gone downhill. I think they are under new management and have a lot of new servers. Seems as though the atmosphere has changed within the restaurant. We will not be rushing to go back. Not happy about this :-("}
{"text":"Had  a late lunch here with hubby. Wine and Beer lists were good.  Food was good, however chef or server was off their mark the day we went.  I ordered a sandwich without the apples and fries as my side.  Sandwich came with apples on the side, no fries which they quickly brought out for me.  Husband ordered a sandwich that the highlight was jalepeno bacon, but bacon was missing on his panini.  But food was still very good.  Will go there again and see if it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a glass of wine and sat down at the outer bar which faces windows. Got no service until a large party came. Waitress was rude and then started pushing in chairs beside me and bumping my elbow. I got up and canceled the cheese I had ordered because balancing is not my strong suit. The manager came over and did nothing, but make me feel I was at fault. Won't be back. Hope the waitress got a good tip from her BIG table.
And the wine is overpriced m."}
{"text":"We love the wine shop! In fact we are there so often the waitress commented that our eight month old is getting big!! The food is very, very good (the truffle fries are the best we've ever had and don't go without getting them and their club sandwich is delicious!!) i've ordered entrées on many occasions as well and they've never disappointed me. The service is always good and the prices are reasonable. They can be busy so call ahead is definitely recommended! We especially love sitting on their patio during the nice months! Also I'm not much of a beer drinker but their beer and wine selection is incredible. Also this area doesn't have many open restaurants on Sundays and those that are serve brunch only. We are not huge brunch fans and I appreciate that they will allow us to order many items from their lunch menu instead (they switch over to lunch at 2 PM but we tend to be there before that). Great place!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant near home! Great food, excellent service and awesome wine selection and beer as well."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but only twice to dine. Once for dinner and once for brunch. The food was mediocre, definitely not worth the price you pay. The dinner and appetizer portions were skimpy but I do admit their brunch portion was decent. Their mimosas and bellinis were nothing to die for. Only good thing would be their selections of wine, other than that I'm ok with skipping this place for a meal."}
{"text":"So yummy! Every time I'm in town visiting my parents we make sure to stop in here! I love the flatbreads, which are kinda like personal pizzas. I also looove the wedge salad!! The wine is always great and the wait staff are funny and so sweet! Love love the wine shop!"}
{"text":"Came in for the brunch menu. Food took very long to arrive, and was cold (filet mignon eggs Benedict). An utterly unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"3 stars because we only had wine and appetizers so I can't comment on the food. I enjoyed the huge selection and their 3 flavors of hummus were delicious! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the server was awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place?! Use to be an upscale feel to it and did not get that at all today. First, everything served was dirty. My water glass, my fork and knife. Tighten that up please as it's gross. My server was a complete mess. She came over hair everywhere and looked overall like she just rolled out of bed. Didn't quite match what this restaurant is trying to portray. We ordered try brought out the food for the person I was with and waited for mine, and waited. Finally waitress came over and told me she put his in but not my order?! How is that possible since you took them at the same time? The comped my meal but the poor guy waited for mine which probably took about 12mins so his food was cold. Food was fine but waitress rarely came back. Had to keep waving her down for drink refills and waited about 25mins for my check. Then never came back, after frustration I decided to waive down another worker to cash me out. Super disappointed in the service and atmosphere, probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We used to eat at the Wine Shop quite frequently. The Truffle fries and the tomato bisque are both solid choices. The last few times we visited this establishment were very disappointing. The service was very poor. We ended up just leaving the last time because our waitress was too busy talking to her peers to even bring us water. It is unfortunate the service ruined what once was a restaurant that was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Wine Shop since it opened.  They have a good selection, always changing as well as a healthy menu of craft beers.  It is casual, good wine spot without being snooty.  The menu is very fresh and good - everything is delicious.  Don't worry, not just little wine apps - you can get pasta, burgers, a flatbread pizza (try the prociutto, fig and gorgonzola, yum), truffle fries, moules frites - they have a great selection with something for any appetite or taste.  I will continue to come to the Wine Shop to enjoy a glass of wine on the patio with girlfriends or casual dinner with my honey, perfect location.  Love it."}
{"text":"This place has every and any Wine you can think of. Be sure to check out the Wine tasting on the weekends that is free to. The food here is also very good as well."}
{"text":"We are new in town and decided to celebrate my birthday with a casual Sunday Funday.  A hostess sat us right away and outside on the patio with our pup. Service was a tad slow on everything (getting water, receiving wine samples, getting our actual wines that we ordered, and silverware for our apps, etc) but because it was a beautiful day, we didn't mind. I'm not really sure if it's normally this slow of service (there weren't a lot of tables) or if it was just an off day. I'll be back again to try more food. They have an extensive wine and food menu and it's right in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been to the Wine Shop many times and always enjoyed it.  There is a limited menu (even more limited because I'm a vegetarian) but the food is well prepared and delicious.  It has a special place in my heart because it's where my now husband and I had our first date and engagement party/gathering. 

It's nice to have a place that is not just wine or food based, but both.  They also offer a cooler case of a very large selection of specialty beers.  If you need a hard to find wine, they can also help you with that and order it!  The prices aren't low but you're paying for a nicer selection of foods and atmosphere.  

They often have free wine tastings on Saturdays and a musician sometimes for brunch on weekends.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the menu is pretty small."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, nice atmosphere.  I frequent this establishment often and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes were awesome! Nice atmosphere. Indoor or outdoor seating. Wine bottles for sale!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! We came in, greeted and sat immediately. We ordered two small plates as appetizers. We had the fried green tomatoes 3 ways, which was to DIE for!! So delicious, I want to go back just for those. We also had the mussels. They were excellent. They came with a spicy sauce. It was delicious. On to the entrees, my friend ordered a burger which she said was absolutely delicious! I had the margarita flatbread with garlic and chicken added. It was flavorful and delicious. Then, we had dessert. My friend had the crème brûlée which I tried, it was good. I had the molten cake and it was absolutely perfect. Of course we need a nap after all that food but I was incredible. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit either inside or out and enjoy a sampler of international cheeses and great wine or beer.  We enjoyed the antipasti dish and Spanish cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome! Best flat breads in the city! Atmosphere was very fun,Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really great place. Huge wine selection but I was actually more impressed with the beer selection. I prefer beer over wine anyway but either one is excellent. The food was great and price was pretty good as well. Located next to a couple of nice desert places as well. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood joint in the Steel Creek/Rivergate part of town. They have an impressive menu offering (not expected from a wine shop). My friend goes there often, and she swears by the truffle fries. Unfortunately we ate so much during brunch that we didn't get to eat anything but a small order of manchego cheese ($6.50 - 2 good size slices with bread and oil/balsamic)

Since I impromptu gave up alcohol for 40 days, it was challenging to hang out at a wine place. Luckily they have a lemongrass non-alcoholic frizzy drink that was quite yummy (but very gassy) as well as other natural soda/fancy water options. They have a good amount of wine by the glass to choose from, average $9 for a decent pour. 

The lady behind the bar was very nice; she made good suggestions and was overall attentive. Definitely a good spot if you live around the area."}
{"text":"A little late on my review, but my husband and I came here for New Years. They had a prix fixe meal with limited options, and it was delicious. My husband got a tender filet and I ordered a seafood pasta dish. The pasta was underwhelming, but still a decent meal. 

I was impressed by tuna for the appetizer, and they brought us a \"bonus\" amuse bouche as a \"treat\" from the chefs. 

It's a nice intimate space, and I enjoyed the light piano music in the background. I felt that our waitress was very helpful and attentive. However, the space is small, and they cover a lot of tables, so at times, it felt slow. I would love to go back for a meal/wine on a regular night, but this is a great option for a casual or special dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beverages. 
Must try the truffle fries... a sure hit!
We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"They offer wine flights, but not in the trio you think of. It is actually only a half of a glass. Odd.

They have beers on tap, but I didn't see these listed on the small menu board until after I had ordered. The server did not explain the offerings and the beers aren't listed on the menu (she didn't explain the wine flight concept either). Ratz.

They don't offer any vegan proteins on their menu, however since they do make their hummus from scratch, they had chickpeas and the chef gladly substituted the cheese on my salad for chickpeas. Cool.

The olive appetizer plate contains only olives with pits and it creates an uncomfortableness because you have to spit them out...somewhere. Gross.

My salad was very fresh and the focaccia bread with the dipping sauce was excellent. Fantastic.

The place did appear clean and it had a sophisticated look. 

I think it would be a nice place to take a date or to chill out after work."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Came in for wine and apps with a friend. Rudely told no tables outside but wouldn't allow us to sit at table inside then move outdoors. Not accommodating at all."}
{"text":"Just left this place for lunch i ordered their calamari which tasted great as well with the chicken flatbread you can never go wrong with a flatbread for the most part!  I could have gotten away with just ordering the calamari it was a lot and very filling! I wish  my server Rachel was a bit more responsive for i had to wait for my flatbread way to long after ordering my calamari as well as wait for her to come back and grab my check/card for quite some time. I also ordered a glass of moscato which was just like I like it savory and  Fruit-Driven .I would definetly recommend this place to come out for a glass of wine and appetizers."}
{"text":"The staff was a little awkward, but the food and drink were amazing!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is wonderful, no matter what you get. The wine and beer selection is unrivaled in the Steele Creek area. What I love about the wine is you pay retail for them, not restaurant markup.  This means that when you pay $50 for a wine, you're getting the same price as you would in a store.  I could go on and on but it would be easier for you to go there."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a nice casual dinner with your wife. Its quiet, but not stuffy. It has a great selection of wine and great food. We got the cheese and meat tray, 2 cheeses and one meat. And then a flatbread. We've been here a few times and we always leave thinking its one of the best places for us to go on a date night."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot in this side of town. The food is so fresh and such a variety to choose from. The wine is great. The outdoor seating is where we always choose and it's great to just relax and have some appetizers. I have gotten the flatbread pizza and it's always a hit. The calamari is amazing too! Enjoy this nice spot!"}
{"text":"Consistent, comfortable, and chill. 

This is my go-to place when I don't want to go very far for dinner or drinks. It's perfect for date night or a night of quiet conversation with a friend. 

I've been here a handful of times and have been pleased each time. The servers are friendly and attentive, the wine selection is amazing, and the food is also consistently good. I was expecting the quality of food at a wine shop to be mediocre at best, but I was wrong. 

An added bonus is the good music that's always on rotation here (Placebo, Portishead, Radiohead, etc - yay!)

Come here when you're in the mood to unwind with a glass of wine and/or food. Get a patio seat if the weather permits (oh, but if you're sensitive to the cigar smoke, then there's a chance you'll be seated next to a cigar smoker). You'll very likely enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for book club with a few friends.  I had a salmon salad with fried goat cheese.  I'm going to be honest, I never knew that I could like goat cheese more than I already did, until I had it fried.  In addition to that, the wine is relatively inexpensive compared to bottle prices in standard restaurants.  We had a very nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and it was $18 or less.  It is a great low key place to meet up with friends for a glass (or three) of wine."}
