{"text":"My favorite place to be -- because it's right down the street and they have 16 interesting beers on tap at all times. This place started as a wine and martini bar, and they do have an impressive wine list. But they have added 16 taps in the past year, so they're also the best draft microbrew establishment on the east side. Tim the bartender also makes the perfect margarita. (Did I mention I can walk there and stumble home?! Yay!)  The menu is excellent and changes seasonally. A number of special event beer dinners are held throughout the year and they've held a great wine and champagne dinner on New Year's Eve for two years now. We held our anniversary party at the BCB last June and it was the perfect place for a Saturday afternoon party. There are two patios (one is non-smoking) for outdoor dining in warm weather.  All in all, don't miss this gem of place in downtown Euclid!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good value overall. I recommend pizza with the red sauce. They have a wide selection of beers on tap and a full whiskey bar. Love this place"}
{"text":"We ordered  the calamari appetizer(no taste),my wife ordered the Fruit dimmare(no taste),I ordered the mushroom pasta dish(no mushrooms,all flour).Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times in the past but mostly take out and it's always been sooo good! Best burger in Euclid. But tonight we had no kids so me and my husband dined in. Every thing was awful. The server was in La la land or something. I ordered my burger medium and it came well well done. My husband ordered medium rare and it was well done. I asked for salt and pepper and she brought us 2 salts but walked away and didn't come back once. She was very attentive to her 2 others tables but walk right by us and keep going when I'd try to get her attention. I ate half my burger and he ate 2 bites. Finally after sitting there 15 mins not eating and wanting to leave she comes with the check. Didn't ask how anything was jut walked away. Did we look like bad tippers or something? I have no clue. But I won't be eating in again. I'll stick to take out."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty (the taco pizza is awesome) but the service has been awful each time we've eaten here. Bad enough that I won't go back."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere. Nice outdoor dining area in the back. Had the garlic chicken BBQ pizza, has provolone and bleu cheese. Loved it!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EVER Go HERE!!!!  I have been going here since it opened, and never had a problem.  Tonight I ordered a drink that I did not care for, and I took two sips and asked the server to send it back, and I ordered another drink instead.  She only said \"does anyone at the table want it?\"  We all responded \"no.\"  When I received the bill, it was still on there.  I told our server about it.  When she came back she said that the owner refused to take it off the bill, was too busy to come to our table, and didn't care if we don't come back.  When I went into the restaurant to talk to him he was rude and belligerent and said \"why should I take the hit for something you ordered and didn't like?\"  When my friend told him that if she acted like that at work she would get fired he said \"so get fired\" and clapped his hands in her face.  I told him that we would never be back, and he said \"I don't care.\"  When told him Yelp, FB, and Urban spoon would know about this, he said \"So what?\"  Absolutely terrible experience!!!!!!  The one thing that I will add that is and always was a positive experience , the food is FABULOUS!  We will surely miss it."}
{"text":"First trip to Beach Club Bistro this afternoon -- what a great spot!  Generous portions, amazing french fries (and sweet potato fries), and the burgers were superb.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"I bought 3 pies, omg phenomenal!!!! The cannoli was absolutely fabulous!!!! The staff is so personable and welcoming. I loved everything and can't wait to go back have a meal on the patio. :-) Lena"}
{"text":"Looks like this place doesn't need another 5-star review (because there are so many), but I'll do so anyway.   Marinara sauce......excellent.   Meatballs........excellent  Atmosphere........excellent.   Enjoy this great local place!!!"}
{"text":"The Beach Club is such a great little place, been here several times for dinner & this was a first for lunch!.Things that make me happy on a lazy Saturday afternoon... mmm really good food that involves gooey cheese and interesting combos; good beers on tap, good ambiance.  Lunch was great - fab service, no screaming children, easy going kind of food.  Started with BBC Bourbon Stout, a heady, foamy slightly spicy stout on tap. truly yum & good for you too. Moved onto the cheese sticks. Now wait, i know u are thinking,\"come on,  cheese sticks\"? It is insulting to call them that - these are hand breaded hunks of random cheese... one had an olive layer in the cheese, the next a nutty swiss... all good cheese.  I had to have a pizza with my faves, and the man had his. Me = artichoke hearts, roasted red pepper & smoked mozz. His = pepperoni + sausage. Results? Fantastic. I had to fight for the last piece of MY pizza later :)"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago. The pizza was pretty good. Service was friendly but not super quick. We attended late on a Sunday evening;  we were two of a handful of patrons that day. Well, we are back again tonight to try a different pizza; the Gilchrist. It was pretty good, I can say that we will be visiting this little neighborhood spot again."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time.  If I return I will definitely come back and tweak this.  We started off with calamari which was excellent.  The pizza I got (I can't remember the name of it, but it had eggplant on it) was really good, but not great.  It was a bit on the bland side.  The crust was the best part -- a perfect combo of warm with some crispy on the outside.  I was on the fence between a 3 and a 4 because I wasn't all that wowed by the food.  But the drink selection is quite extensive and the service was impeccable.  I actually felt bad because our waiter was so on the ball and it was my first time there and I naturally can be a bit indecisive about things... well anyway, the waiter was quite an asset to the establishment.  Very knowledgeable, helpful, and really good at anticipating our dining needs.  I enjoyed the set up of the place -- very intimate yet relaxed.  I'd definitely go back and try more of the menu... I have a feeling the other stuff might be tastier than what I picked for my first try... and if I do I will be sure to report updates!"}
{"text":"The taco Pizza  was very good and spicy.   However,  the service was very poor at best. It was also a bit pricy for what you get.  Just a 2 out of 5 for me."}
{"text":"Really great place! We sat on the back patio and had a nice salad and a yummy veggie calzone. The marinara sauce was delicious too."}
{"text":"The food there was good...on the other hand coming from food service myself I can't help but feel bad for that kitchen staff. I saw the same people that prepared my food come out and grab bus tubs full of dirty dishes throughout the night.  I could only put two and two together and think they must not have a dish wisher. I figure it all comes down to management. If it gets that busy like the Friday I was there they should definitely have someone there doing the dishes. Not only because that job is there for a reason, but out of respect for the guys cooking food night in and night out. It all comes down to greed by the people in charge now a days..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner last Saturday. I was looking forward to eating at the Beach Club Bistro because he always raved about the food.  As we entered, we were the only people in line...I thought great!  However we had to wait a little over 5 minutes to be seated because the hostess was watching the Triple Crown race on TV...sigh.   After being seated, we ordered chicken skewers and shrimp tacos for appetizers. The tacos were simply delicious but the chicken skewers were a little bland.  For our main entrées, we ordered the chicken club sandwich with all the fixings and fries.  I have to say, it was one of the best grilled chicken sandwiches I've ever eaten in a restaurant.    Our server was disengaged...almost to the point of being rude.  After our food was served, the only time she returned to our table was to bring the check.  She never asked if we wanted dessert or if she could get us anything else. When she came back to pick up the money, she didn't say thank you or please come again. She just walked away.   Needless to say I was disappointed and somewhat annoyed in the service, but overall the food was pretty good.  I'm an optimist so I'm going to give the Beach Club Bistro one more chance...maybe our server was having a bad day.  However, if one of my family members or friends asked me for a recommendation right now I would say \"good food..lousy service\"."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch by myself. There was ample parking in a lot to the side. I went in through the back entrance and chose the (adorable) patio, so I didn't see the inside. But I loved the atmosphere.   Service was friendly and helpful. I ordered a margherita pizza with red sauce. The pizza was really good, not the best around, but definitely worth trying -- I was impressed at the wide selection of food but knew I went there for the pizza. Only complaint was that there always a little too much sauce on the pizza. And usually I love a heavy-handed sauce it this had HUGE chunks of tomato and was a little too much. Overall though, a really nice spot and very relaxing to sit with a book and enjoy."}
{"text":"Most underrated restaurant in Cleveland.  Fantastic pizza.  Fantastic wine and beer selection.  Good service.  Great setting.  Especially during the summer when you can sit outside in the back."}
{"text":"Beach Club Bistro boasts a diverse food menu, solid beer selection, and a great patio.    BCB is well-known for their delicious pizzas with creative local names.  I am basic, so my go-to's are always the Margarite or a pepperoni pizza, and they are tasty of course, but I am here to tell you that their greatness goes beyond their famed pizzas.   Everything on the app list is great.  The 'Tater Totchos' are insanely, but the spring rolls are my favorite. Grab an order of either one with a beer whenever you watch the tribe roll.    For entrees, I am not sure if it was a lent special or not but the fish fry was  very flavorful and very filling, but I am a sucker for any beer battered fish.  Their cheese ravioli is like a 4 cheese pizza but in pasta form.  Lastly, if you are in the mood for some greens, I highly recommend the summer caprese with chicken.  The fried mozzeralla sliced are what put it over the top.  I am telling you there are no wrong choices to be made here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.   They have excellent food.   When I was a meat eater I can say they had very good burgers and their pizza is very good for Ohio (no offense to any life long Ohioans).  It has that dive like feel, in a good way, if you know what I saying.   Seems like a fairly happening place.   I have been here several times, mostly for lunch and almost always get pizza.   I have no complaints of any kind.   The servers were great and attentive, my glass of water was always topped off and the food was excellent.  NOTE: Closed on Mondays - that can throw some people off.  Great place to hit up for lunch in Euclid if you are in the area.   I would definitely recommend stopping here if you have never been."}
{"text":"5 stars had there not been a smell on the second visit and a little less responsive daytime staff.   The food is excellent here and the service when we had dinner here was personable and prompt. The best anyone could ask for.   We kinda sampled it all. Some kind of chicken appetizer kabob creation (awesomely grilled), a vegetarian pizza that was ridiculously good, and the pot roast dinner. We split it all and it was just great all the way around. Will go again.   Pricey (especially wine) but good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I love this place, especially in the summer on their patio! The service is always great and the fried motz is a must try! Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"This place is consistently excellently executing great food and drink selection in a very sophisticated but unpretentious way.  A favorite."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot, with a facade that does a good job of serving injustice to the interior. I have had a few of the pizzas, the meatball, and the mozzarella.   Stay away from the mozzarella, it's a breaded nightmare.  I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of the split bar. There's a path in the middle, and I don't think it was thought out well.   The sit down area is cozy. Nicely separated from the bar area so you can enjoy a date night without dealing with buffoonery over yonder (in Euclid, maybe  not but hey, who knows?).  Don't park in the spot immediately next door...there's a smaller parking area that is north of the larger space to the left.  Any place that serves Founders on tap is gonna get 4 stars from me, that's just how the cookie crumbles where I'm from."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish fry to go.  Wasn't aware that it no longer came with green beans. That is how it's been served for the past couple of years.  The beans, along with sweet potato fries made it one of the better fish fries out there. Green beans have been replaced by a meager, uninteresting coleslaw."}
{"text":"Good service since the moment I walked in. The food was absolutely delicious. The pizza was think but crispy and full of flavor. The calzones are huge and tasty. The brownie was homemade, huge, and very moist. Overall, my wife and I loved it and will come back."}
{"text":"This place has a huge alcohol selection plus a unique style of gourmet pizzas the likes of which are similar to that of the Wild Goose in DTW."}
{"text":"Last week we sat at the bar for 10 minutes without any attention. So, we gladly got up, walked across the street and was serviced right away. Not like the place is very big or anything."}
{"text":"What a lovely Tuesday eve meeting friends at the Beach Club for dinner.  2 had the chicken & pasta, 1 the Hawaiian pork sandwich and 2 had lasagna.  Everyone loved their food, the ambience and the service.  The food did take a little time to prepare but I appreciated how good everything was.  The coffee caramel ice cream was fabulous.  Will be back next time we're in CLE."}
{"text":"Good drinks, great food, fun decor! There's also a wonderful man who frequents, Richard, who gives great suggestions. If you see him say hi. He's great company and really adds some life to the quiet bar"}
{"text":"Their patio...*sigh*....OH the patio!!!  It is so pretty!  Very classy with such a pleasant atmosphere! The food is delicious and the wine selection is impressive! So thrilled the weather has FINALLY turned into spring so we can enjoy sitting outside again soon!"}
{"text":"What a good find. This place looked rather dubious from outside, but the decor and atmosphere inside quickly turned worry over a potential lunch mistake aside. Service was excellent, our server was attentive and honest about the quality of the food. He made suggestions on what was the best to try and had some good tips about other places in the area. I had the pulled pork sandwich, something I usually don't get because the typical pulled pork is either too dry or smothered in barbecue sauce. This was neither, but instead it hada nice subtle bourbon flavor. The meat was juicy all the way through and the coleslaw blended well with the pretzel bun, creating a delicious sandwich party in my mouth. The french fries were delightfully crispy, a nice companion to the sandwich. My companion had the cheesesteak wrap and a side of broccoli. The side was more like an entire meal of perfectly cooked broc. It dwarfed the wrap on the plate, which is pretty awesome if you like broccoli as much as my lunch date did. Her wrap was excellent, it came with this fantastic horseradish sauce that just made it all pop. I would happily come back here for lunch foods again."}
{"text":"I just started working in this area and wanted to find a decently priced place, close in vicinity, to be able to pick up a salad or small app for lunch occasionally. THE WINTER CAPRESE is all I have to say. Honestly, I haven't even finished the salad yet, and I'm in here writing a 5-star review. It is to die for. Perfect for a lunch salad!  Also- I have been in twice now, only for pick up but the employees are so friendly! And they really seem to care about what they do. I'll be sure to become a regular pretty quick!"}
{"text":"To start with, we had the cheese sticks. Not your bland usual mozzarella logs! These were incredible freshly made, varietal cheeses hand breaded in panko and herbs - truly enjoyable and delicious, as we were soon to find out that everything we tried was incredible. I didn't finish this review until some time later, so I don't recall everything we had - I guess this means we must go back again!! I just remember that it was really, really good. Time to make another trip to the Beach Club Bistro!!"}
{"text":"Throughout the northeastern United States, but most notably here in Ohio, the most difficult part of summer is always at the end. This is the time when we say goodbye. Yet, as the days grow shorter and the air takes on its chill, there are little reminders that life keeps giving, even as the days wrap themselves in darkness.     True, we will miss summer dresses and how they cling to bare legs, but there is consolation to be found in firm hug of a sweater. And yes, these are the days when the lush greenery of Lakeview cemetery begins to drift downward in swirling waves and like an ocean of gold and red, breaks and crashes on the rocks of weathered stone; memorials to countless summers gone by. The very air becomes a living, dying, metaphor for time's refusal to hold to any one day. The landscape becomes equal parts mosaic, illustrating the force of change, and scenic backdrop for nostalgia, breathtaking in its own right.     Yet, if the Cleveland connoisseur knows where to look, here is deeper comfort still and its just waiting to be found. This is the time of year when, within the most special of caprese salads, tomato has subsided to beat. A flavorful reminder that no matter how cold the winter on the lake may become, the Beach Club Bistro is the friend for all seasons. A friend who never says goodbye."}
{"text":"My digestive track is still doing it's job as I sit here writing this review. (Sorry, TMI?)   Called the Beach Club tonight for carry-out. The entire experience was pleasant from start to finish. The person who answered the phone was polite and happily reported that my order would be ready in 25 minutes. I was worried I would be late! They have a cute little door for carry-out pickups that is labeled \"carry-out\" -- very convenient when you don't want the entire restaurant to see you looking all scrubby.  It's Friday night and I don't eat healthy on the weekends, or ever really, so I decided to order an appetizer AND a pizza. Smothered Hand-Cut Chips? (rosemary+parmesan, crumbled pancetta, scallions,cheddar cheese,manchego cream sauce) Hi!!!    As a resident of Euclid, I really appreciate that they named all of their specialty pizzas after some of the various private beach clubs in the area. I went with the Brookwood Club (red sauce, spinach, stuffed eggplant, roasted red peppers, provolone, asiago) and I was very happy with it. (Very appropriate too since that particular club is right at the end of my street. Neat.) Perfect crust, perfect amount of toppings, delicious and just what I was looking for.   Next time, I will eat in the restaurant. It seemed like a comfy, cozy kinda place. I really would have liked to have a few beers with my pizza but it was not in the cards this night.   A few things also worth noting: They have a really nice looking patio. They serve more than just pizza. Their website is nice and actually up to date. They're part of Cleveland Independents. I'm happy that I live close by."}
{"text":"My gust and I shared a 12 in. edgecliff pizza, $20.was  outrageous. They charge for a original pizza @ $9.95 then the edgecliff pizza  additional 10.60 which had four items on it. Totally over priced for a just average pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered calamari as an appetizer ( I forgot to take a picture) it was fresh, came with lemon, arugula and fresh parmesan it could have used a little more seasoning but it was cool, I ordered meatball sub, fish fry for the hubby and pepperoni pizza for the kids. The meatballs are huge, moist and flavorful, the fish was great!!! Fresh, seasoned better than the calamari and their tartar sauce is awesome! Pizza was hot, cheesy and fresh. Service was outstanding. A small, quaint, laid back establishment!"}
{"text":"While \"pizza\" comes with its name, this place is about more than just pies. Beach Club Pizza Bistro was the bellwether restaurant in the awesome-dining revolution brewing in the Euclid/Cleveland-East right now. Its unpretentious (albeit stylish, inviting and well done) setting, great service, reasonable prices and stellar menu make for a great -- and deelish -- night out. Not only are the pizzas some of the best in Cleveland (looking for excellent crust, a gourmet selection of well-paired toppings and perfect portions?), the restaurant offers a great collection of pizza pairings that I could eat each night of the week with a smile on my face. From an alfredo seafood pie to ricotta-eggplant roulettes, margharita to salsa chicken: these pizzas will be best friends with your palette. Word has it that the wine selection is tops too. But when you're not in the mood for wine and pizza, the menu is well-rounded with dishes like build-your-own pad thai, killer calamari, pull-pork sandwiches and an ever-changing list that changes by the season. My only regret is the sweet potato tart with white chocolate ganache from the dessert menu rocked my world a few years ago and never came back. But the desserts, which are equally seasonable, regularly surprise and please. Just like the restaurant itself. What I've long appreciated about the bistro is that it makes a point about creating a pleasing dining experience. They're not knocking your socks off with fancy light fixtures or dishes that make the news for their price tags. It's about enjoying gourmet dishes in a relaxed atmosphere in one of the greatest neighborhoods around Cleveland."}
{"text":"My daughter and I dined here on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was fairly quiet, with approximately 5-7 additional customers.  We were immediately seated and proceeded to browse the menu.   Based on Yelp reviews and rave reviews from a co-worker, I was leaning toward the pizza.   We ordered the Margherita pizza (small - 6 cut $12.95) and she ordered the side Caesar salad, and I ordered the Iceberg Wedge.   The salads arrived within a few minutes, as I proceeded to cut up my salad, I noticed that there was quite a bit of brown lettuce, so I spent the next few minutes picking, at least a handful of the unappetizing lettuce from my salad.   Other than that the salad was pretty good with ripe & juicy grape tomatoes, hardboiled eggs, sliced cucumbers, lots of bacon and chunky (homemade?) bleu cheese dressing.  Also there was no salt or pepper on any of the tables, nor was there an offer for fresh ground pepper (which I love), for my salad.  My daughter enjoyed her caesar salad, the only complaint was the croutons which were  either from a box OR homemade, but stale.    Our pizza arrived steaming hot, and bubbly, loaded with fresh crushed tomatoes, lots of basil and a very good quality mozzarella.  The underlying garlic sauce had fresh slivered garlic.  The crust was just right...not too thin, with the right amount of crunch. Although the ingredients were fresh and the pizza was well made, I found it to be just ok, my daughter thought the same.   There was lots of oil on the plate beneath the pizza and I'm not a fan of huge amounts of crushed tomatoes.   The tomatoes could have used a bit more seasoning.  Also there was a small display on each table which listed the desserts which were pretty pricey (around $7.50).  I would have thought there would be more of a push to offer desserts.  Not at all, we were given the check and sent on our way.  All in all, this was a good experience.   Would I go back....sure, just won't be my go-to place."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and calzones. Good beer selection and fast friendly service. I've even heard excellent music here from the One-Eyed Jacks."}
{"text":"Beach Club Bistro is hands-down the best restaurant in Euclid. It is located in a small building in downtown Euclid and has two rooms: the \"lounge\" and the \"dining room\". There is also a small bar with five or six seats, but the real gem is the back patio, which is open during decent weather. The restaurant seems to do pretty good business, but it's usually not excessively busy. They take reservations but you probably only need one during prime time on Friday or Saturday.  The food is consistently excellent. I typically don't order pizza at restaurants because I feel like I can get pizza anywhere, but the Beach Club is an exception. The prices are very reasonable to boot. They keep a huge selection of wine as well as a diverse bunch of beers on tap. All of the servers are friendly and good at what they do. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and never had a bad experience.  The food is always good. The staff  is nice and  its never a long wait.   The pizzas  are really  good. I normally get the Utopia pizza which is good (get the garlic aioli on the side .) The shrimp tacos are one of the best I've had. The salmon is good. Its a really nice spot to chill ad have a cocktail after work. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place and when it's nice outside sit in the patio area. The staff is friendly and food always come out hot and delicious. And the utopia pizza is the bomb I walk up there just to sit at the bar sometimes it's always good friendly people there. Try everything you want regret it."}
{"text":"OMG. CB got pizza here for us today. What amazing pizza! I cannot wait to bring hubby here soon. So good!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited recently for lunch.  Due to the weather, we were the only people in the place.  We were seated in the bar area, which was nice because it had three TVs on.  It also gave me time to check out the beers on tap, although I was unable to enjoy them on this occasion (guess that's one reason why I'll be coming back).  Food: I ordered the VASJ pizza, and despite the imitation crab, it was pretty tasty.  Don't know that I would make it my go-to, but it was solid.  My daughter originally ordered the 4 cheese mac & cheese, but did not like it.  In her defense, it was a little dry since it had been baked.  You would expect a 4 cheese mac to be a little more \"cheesy.\"  She switched to the grilled cheese (kid's menu), and was happy with that.  IMO, it was an excellent grilled cheese, and the fries were done tempura style, which as interesting.  Service: our waiter was the bartender, and he was generally on top of things.  He was nice enough to remove the mac & cheese from the bill on his own accord.  When he observed my interest in their beer selection, he brought over the beer/wine menu, and gave me a flier to an upcoming beer event.  Overall, I'd say this is one of the better choices in Euclid for dining, and hopefully more restaurants like BCB start to pop up in the area."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant. My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday. Not very crowded but didn't bother us. We both ordered the pork belly BLT with szechwan green beans. Yummy!! The only downfall was my sandwhich was piled high with tender slices of pork which made my bread fall apart.ha ha. Excellent tasting meal. Green beans were awesome too. We did not have any mixed drinks but the walls are covered in bottles of whiskey and bourbon so if that's your thing, plenty to choose from. Lots of TVS to enjoy the Sunday football games. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great place to eat when you want to dine alone in peace. I love Paragon (across the street), but sometimes I just want good food in a closed setting. I sat at the bar & when I got my menu, I saw that they had plenty of vegetarian options. For a vegan meal, I ate the Grilled Portobello Wrap with a side of sweet potato fries. It was a big enough helping for dinner & the bartender was nice enough to give me a few lemon wedges on the side."}
{"text":"The best shrimp tacos I've ever had. Super unique take on seafood tacos which includes a sesame seaweed. Delicious. The summer caprese salad has a wonderful blend of flavors. One thing I have noticed: the fries are definitely worth skipping."}
{"text":"Just made my first trip here today and I'm pleased to say I was not at all disappointed! First plus (for me) was that it's a nice, small, laid back place. Second was the very friendly and attentive waiter! (Unfortunately I didn't catch his name.) And of course, last but most certainly not least, the food! My fiancé and I started with the hand breaded coconut shrimp and it was delicious! The dipping sauces it comes with are amazing! For entrees he and I got the Arcadia burger and the Viking (seafood pizza), respectively. He said it was the best burger he's ever eaten! Which is quite a feat considering all of his beefy conquests! My pizza was perfection! Exactly what I had in mind! Flavorful and surprisingly large! (As was his giant burger.) They also had a very large wine and beer menu which I will be back in the summer to partake in! Overall I give 4 out of 5, I would give 4.5 if I could. They only lose a half point because I felt their prices were just a little steep. (Then again, I'm kind of on the cheap side! Hahaha.)"}
{"text":"Beach Club Bistro should be a destination visit for all pizza lovers.   Located in downtown Euclid on Lakeshore Blvd., this place does everything they do to near perfection. Beach Club boasts a cozy atmosphere whether dining or drinking. The restaurant is split in two with the dining area on one side and a bar on the other. They even have a pretty expansive outdoor patio area. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The drink menu consists of a surprisingly extensive listing of craft brews. The food menu is well versed and plenty creative, but without a doubt, the star of the menu has to be the pizza.   In addition to the create your own pizzas, there's over a dozen or so specialty pizzas, each named after a local beach club. After much thought, we chose to split the 12\" Concord Club, which was topped with extra virgin olive oil, baby spinach, garlic, asiago, provolone and CLAMS! To drink, several draft Dead Guy Ales by Rogue.  There was no two ways about it. Clams on pizza could've been either great or terrible. Luckily for us, the pizza was excellent! Well balanced in flavor, the pizza dough even stood out and in a good way.   It's always a good thing when you think about a meal a few days after you've had it. Memory and context have a lot to do with that. Days later, I'm still replaying the meal had at Beach Club. Can't wait to come back to try another specialty pie!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Beach Club Bistro.  Both the food/drinks and service is great .  Here at least 3x a month."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, but that's about it. We always wait for the hostess to seat us as if we are interrupting something.  This last time we went, we waited 20 mins for our waitress to bring the bill then another 10 for her to actually pick it up. No apologies. If you aren't a regular you get the vibe you are unwelcome and an outsider."}
{"text":"where's the tuna steak sandwich?? this was my favorite thing on the menu, and i am devastated to report that it is now gone! tragic. anyways, the patio is great, i love it out there! they have a great beer and wine selection, and good pizzas and salads. i can't remember the exact names, but ive had a tasty pesto pizza there before. the mole pizza is a little lackluster, the mole needs more 'zing'. they have a really good deal for call ahead lunch orders, one pizza and two salads for like $12 or something, its nice."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! The mashed potato pizza is the best one around including The wild goose in willoughby or J's pizza in mentor. The giant meatballs are the truth as well as the pork belly sandwich. Haven't had anything I didn't like from here. Little pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I've been here and I must say I'm disappointed. I ordered the Henn mansion pizza and it was raw in the middle. They gladly remade me a pepperoni pizza and it was good. After that, I took a friend there to eat. I ordered the pork belly sandwich and it was terrible. The meat was fatty and parts were hard. The bread was also not so fresh. I can't recommend BCB for the food but the bar is cool. Also the staff is nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I don't often venture to Euclid, but I wanted to try something different before a show at the Beachland Ballroom, so I turned to Yelp and found this place. People I talked to and the reviews raved about the pizza, but my husband had just made Italian the night before and I'm picky about pizza anyway, so went off script. I tried the walleye with cilantro and my husband had the turkey burger with Szechuan green beans as a side for something different. We really enjoyed our dishes, though the husband's turkey burger was not too exciting (he blamed himself and not the cook). In the end, I think we also tried the pizza in a roundabout way. We got the shrimp and crab dip appetizer, which came with what looked like lightly cheesy pizza crust for dipping. It was tasty, but a few more sea creatures in there would have been nice. The fully covered patio was a real treat on a hot day. Last and certainly not least, they have a very nicely varied beer list with quite a few Midwestern microbrews. This spot will be on my radar next time circumstances send me that direction."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to leave a good review for such a perfect little bistro on Lakeshore.  As stated in ALL the reviews, their pizza is terrific.  I love it when places use fresh ingredients with no concern whatsoever with your health.  Hooraay!!  The other menu option that has me back for more is their Cuban Sandwich.  They use pulled pork and its delicious.  great place to meet friends or even to grab lunch with coworkers which I have also done.  I would say they are a little on the pricey side at first glance but after your food arrives, that thought will soon disappear.    The patio is really private and nicely put together.  I'll be back to have a glass of wine out there starting next spring for sure.  Euclid should be happy places like this exist.  Maybe the trend will catch on.  You have to go.  No questions asked.  I want one of those man pizzas now!!"}
{"text":"This is a treasure find. We were looking for \"Kebab House\" across the street and didn't realize it was closed. The outside of Beach Club Bistro looks like a normal restaurant with neon sign \"Beer, Wine, Pizza, Seafood\" lite up.   This place is hoping and packed. The beer and wine selection is great. The food is so delicious. Following everyone who reviewed to stick to the pizza. They are right. The pizza is well made. My wife ordered the Beachland Club Pizza and it was delicious. I ordered the fried calamari and it was served with pesto mayo and marinara sauce sprinkled with fresh chopped basil. It was simply delicious. I ordered a lasagna and it was so delicious. It's so homemade with the touch of TLC. It is very cheesy, layered with meat, spinach and yummy goodness. Finally we shared a Limencello cake and presentation was great as well delicious.   I would definitely go back again to tried other food. During the Lent, there's fish fry special. To avoid waiting, make reservation before going."}
{"text":"We went here once after getting a bad vibe from the manager at Parragon across the street and I had always heard good things. Overall, I liked it but it's not a place that has me running back for more. I got a pulled pork sandwhich and he had a burger. Mine was good but was definitely and knife and forker but the butter knife given to me just wasn't cutting it. The bread for the bun was awesome and from what I've heard reflects their pizza dough. We did not get any pizza but apparently that is what they are known for. I'm sure we will be back and give that staple a shot but from the rest of the menu it wasn't a mind blowing place. I did like how diverse their side dish options were because I'm not a french fry and onion ring lover. Also, their wine selection seemed really great but their beers were even better. We loved all of the micro brew options and the fact that they carried a lot of local stuff. This really made our trip there worth thinking about going back for a good brew and pie!"}
{"text":"Unmiserable Cleveland sent me a Cleveland care package, and along with other local freebies and coupons, a coupon for a free pizza at Beach Club Bistro was included. Ryan and I had never been, so we decided to venture out on a below freezing day.   On first sight I fell in love with the kitsch. Definitely something we've never experienced before. And the staff was attentive and so nice! We both ordered sodas and split an appetizer. The dragon cakes were so good, I wish there were more! For the pizza, we split a Coronado Club. \"Authentic mole, roasted chicken, poblano peppers, onions, chihuahua cheese, and fresh cilantro\". Definitely different than any pizza I'd ever had, but it was delicious. The mole was just the right bend of sweet, cocoa, and spice. And the crust was cooked perfectly. The cheese was still bubbling when it got to the table!   Even though I live in Lakewood, I'd make another trip out to Euclid to try this place out. The martini menu looked good, and I hear they have great deals. All in all, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pizzas, and received them fairly quickly--but didn't really enjoy them.  They were relatively expensive, so we took them home--but I'm hoping my hubby forgets about them :/.  The service was good, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow.  The service staff acts as if they don't care.  Although I have had spotty service in the past this was the last straw.  If you have to eat here try the pizza and the Salmon but  beware of surely staff"}
{"text":"Stopped in based on reviews. We split a small pizza and it was bigger than it sounds. The rest of our group ordered battered fried haddock, salad, cheeseburger, and spaghetti and (ginormous) meatballs. Initially the prices seemed a little high until we saw the portion sizes. Generally everyone was happy with the things they ordered."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times when I lived a few blocks away, but I had not been back since I moved in 2010. They added a bourbon bar with an extensive selection.    So, from previous experiences to present, the food, drinks, and service is well worth a drive from the west side to the east...and anyone who knows me knows that takes A LOT for me to say!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially in the summer with the outside patio. Great selection of beers (if available); some different food events; reasonable prices, good ambiance."}
{"text":"This place has some of the BEST pizza I have ever enjoyed.  Personally, I am a fan of the meat-lovers Utopia Pizza (fitting name, I know) but there are tons of choices for anyone that may go in there.  And it doesn't just stop at pizza.  Tons of salads and other dishes complement a beautiful menu.  And did I mention the alcohol selection?  Not only do they have an incredible selection of beer (they dont keep any crappy domestics around) they also house an incredible wine and liquor selection.  I want to say that their beer, wine, and liquor list is like ten pages long, but that could just be me being excited.  In all seriousness though, this is one of my favorite little places to stop on the East side of Cleveland.  The prices are reasonable, the staff is inviting, and the food is just phenomenal.  And to make things even better, they use fresh, local products in many of their meals!  If you are in the area, please stop in.  Or at least order a pizza to take home!"}
{"text":"I really cant get enough of this place... been there two times in the past week! What a surprising find in Euclid! Great quiet little place to sit and truly enjoy some of the best pizza I've ever had! Seriously. Both vegetarian and non-veg pie's are stellar! I don't know how soon it will be before I stray away from the pizza, it's just too good. Fresh food, delicious recipes (try: caprese salad with beets), and great service.  Only down side was although they had a great beer selection, I had to reorder my choices both times I've been, not sure when the lack of something as simple as Labatt happened, but this certainly does not take away from the great food."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the pizza and salads we wouldn't even try to come in here anymore. Even takeout is becoming a issue. Beach club you're lucky we love your pizza's or you would lose about 160.00 per month we spend their getting pizza. I write this to the owners, I don't know if your plan to is to close up shop in Euclid to complete the transition to concord but keep the not great service and slow food and I'll go back to buying papa john's, and saving about 100.00 per month. Come on how hard is it to write down someone's order stage the entry of the order and to make sure the patron has enough time to complete their pervious course. Oh this really got me. We were told by the hostess that you could not reserve the  patio seating. And then the couple before us walked in a said they had ??? Umm ... I could go on and on but It's like beating a dead horse.  The review does not come from a onetime dining  experience but from many years . I hope they can maybe pull it together."}
{"text":"Attended Yelper Dorothy's birthday here(you can call her Dottie). We had a long table where her whole crazy family, Yelper Louise and i could sip some brews and chew on dough. The pizzas have been covered extensively by others, so i'll just say they are quasi rustic and very flavorful. Also tried the clam dip. Good stuff.   Now the brews....don't get me started. This is where this place really impressed me. They almost approached Beer Engine(which is over rated) or Balantine in beer selection. I had an Ithaca Apricot Wheat(quickly becoming a go-to choice) and a Three Philosophers ale-cherry lambic hybrid. That shit blew my F'ing mind. I'm sure these brews are available in a lot of places, but the prices here are very wallet friendly. So many other brews to choose from, so i'll have to go back.  So nice that foodies have a place in Euclid to get a bite. There's not much going on there otherwise. The decor is intimate but casual. A lot of brick and dramatic lighting. A good view of Lakeshore boulevard can be had in the front window. Service was perfect. A+"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with cocktails on a Friday night. Had the Mediterranean salad and ahi tuna tacos. And a cucumber lime martini.  All very good.  Very nice vibe in downtown Euclid.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped to have lunch  on our way to Pennsylvania.  We searched for restaurants with our GPS and this was the first that popped up. I was a little wary when we pulled up, it looked like a dive from the outside (not that there's anything wrong with dives, I just wasn't in the mood for anything greasy).  Once inside, I felt better. It's  a really cute place.  We started with the seafood chowder which my husband really enjoyed, I thought it was just ok (I don't care for pureed seafood- I  prefer chunks in my soup).  For lunch we had some sort of grilled tuna sandwich and a Cuban (or maybe it was Caribbean) pulled pork sandwich.  Both were delicious. Service was also excellent- overall, it was a pretty great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Pizza delicious (though order was incorrect, would have preferred to have what we'd ordered... and wasn't really acknowledged); fish fry delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. Went on a Saturday...pretty quiet. The place definitely have their regulars.  I think they have happy hour all day on Sundays."}
{"text":"After having no luck at other establishments Saturday night, we stopped in and had a great time.  The beer selection is always great.  They mix up the styles on draft to please everyone.  I ordered the caprese ciabatta (a special) and it was amazing!! The tomatoes were so ripe!  I was so pleased. My husband ordered their Hawaiian pizza, and was talking about it for days. I will always enjoy coming here.  I have never had a bad experience."}
