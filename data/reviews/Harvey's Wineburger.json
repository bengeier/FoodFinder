{"text":"Great dive bar, come here after dodgeball to relax and socialize. Staff are great and always attentive. The burgers are awesome and they have a great  variety of beer and any mixed drink you can cook up! They have made some great upgrades with new big HD flatscreens, and shuffleboard. cool place to chill anytime!"}
{"text":"awesome burgers.  decent service.  good atmosphere.  it's a dive bar.  just fyi.  with good food."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge bar person, so walking into a dive bar on this side of town was scary.  Was I not with a big strong male, I would have likely not even bothered.  I got a wineburger, onion rings, and beer.  The service was incredibly friendly and the conversation at the bar was entertaining.  The burger was incredibly flavorful although sort of greasy and the beer and onion rings were average. I would totally go back here (with company) for burgers and the creepy yet surprisingly friendly and entertaining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place if your looking for cheap pub food/beer. Their burger is out of control good as are their onion rings. I had a chicken sandwich there as well which was delicious. Would definitely recommend if your looking for a divey cheap night out. Good daily specials as well."}
{"text":"Great little dive with cheap drinks. The Burgers are one of my favorite in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good, and enjoyable with a beer. And there fries... plus getting a car wash next door while this takes place is even more worth while."}
{"text":"this place is sooooooooooooooooo GOOOD.

the drinks are awesomely cheap, and they have an atm to take out all of your money to spend on so much booze because they only take cash. 

monty is probably the coolest bartender to have ever walked the earth, and he always tells us he missed us whenever we come back. he tells us strange anecdotes about his life, that are hilarious and involve things that would probably send most people to therapy. and he makes the BEST burger i have ever tasted. seriously the best burger i have ever tasted. the best. the onion rings are so good too. 

all the denny's waitresses from down across the street come hang out after (and before?) work. they have a couple of pool tables, and this sweet-ass old-school bowling game that costs like, a quarter and is old and made of wood, which instantly makes it awesome. and it sounds awesome. 

AND! if all that wasn't enough to make this the greatest bar ever, they also have twilight zone pinball, which is THE BEST PINBALL GAME OF ALL TIME. we have won so many free games on that thing. everyone probably gets weirded out because we play pinball wizard by the who on the jukebox while we play.

except one negative. whenever monty (awesome) isn't working, some other cracked out babe works and she always closes the damn place at like 1, which is SO annoying (we're talking fridays and saturdays here--monty stays open til at least 2 even on tuesdays). and she always forgets our change and orders and everything else, really. and makes us feel like we're cracked out just by watching her.

basically, just go when monty is working (he looks like the guy painted on the wall next to the smoking area)."}
{"text":"Great cheap burgers
Fantastic people watching
Sit at the bar to watch them cook and to mingle with the crazy regulars
Game room with pool table and pin bowling.
Great place to watch a game
Get grilled onions on your burger"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town and the best service in town. Go once and it will be a wkly spot if not daily !!!! Our office gets take out wkly anywheres from 4 to 14 orders at once and they are always spot on, excellent and delicious every time, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers, fries, onion rings I've had in years! Must go! Delicious and cheap, cant be beat!"}
{"text":"What a great place! 8 of us met on a Tuesday night and couldn't have been happier. The food was good and the staff was attentive and very nice. Real nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"With this summer weather it's difficult to cook at home.  My husband and I are going out for lunch and dinner during the weekends and are always looking for local places to eat. 
Today we felt like burgers so we decided to visit Harvey's.
We shared the big burger & fries and it was not bad at all. 
After dinner I asked him if he'd come back and he surprisingly said yes (he's a picky eater).
He said he would have rated Harvey's 4.5 but that he wasn't pleased the cook was the server and the bartender."}
{"text":"People really need to understand where they are going and the role the place is supposed to fulfill.  I find it funny that all three of the negative reviews mention how the food was great and the environment is chaos.  That is what they do at Harvey's.  Apparently everyone who went got Polly, who is ridiculously hilarious and a lot of fun, not on meth, not drunk, just really interesting from the chemicals produced inside her own head.  Personally, I prefer Monty, he is a sarcastic fifty-something Midwesterner who cooks one of the best burgers I have ever had (sorry, better than Polly), mixes a mean Manhattan, tells awesome stories and will simultaneously insult you, shake your hand and discount your drink.  When the bowling game is functional it promotes awesomely competitive tournaments and if you take over the jukebox the moment you arrive you create your own ambience.  Bring a friend, split the Super Wineburger with Cheese and an order of Chicken Fingers, leave happy.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat as desired. The only reason I would consider bumping it down a star is that I am normally a devout beer drinker and they only have Budweiser and something (I believe coors) light on draft.  Don't care, cheap cocktails and Midwestern bitterness save the day."}
{"text":"Great burger, $2 16oz PBR's all day everyday, fun atmosphere. The service was great. Clean bathrooms, but yet still a local bar. First time here and definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"This place is misleading.  Wineburger is a great concept and name, but the place is nothing more than a strip mall burger joint.  Like other reviews, it's 95% bar, 5% restaurant with a cheers type atmosphere. 
Went on a Wednesday night and all the TVs were on a infomercial channel.  When I asked if they could put something else on, the middle aged Persian bartender told me that the cable was out and somehow we were stuck with a P90x drone .  Another flaw, the ventilation is so poor that you smell like you actually  fried the burgers on your stovetop. 
Many better places in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Let me say that I love places that people don't really know about, and I'm a real foodie. I heard about this place on a local radio station, and someone was saying how good they thought it was, so I thought I'd give it a try when I got around to it. I walked in the door, and the atmosphere was... Interesting. But in a good way. I went for lunch and you'd think you were at a fun Saturday night. the burger took a while to come out, but ermagherd it was hands-down one of the best burgers I've ever had. I'm 200 pounds, I've had a few burgers in my time. My only complaints are:
They're real stingy with the fries. You'd think for the price you'd get more, but I got like 10 fries. (I'm exaggerating of course)
And the time. It took like 20 minutes to get the food out. I had begun to think they forgot about us. But in the end, it was pretty awesome. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I know there are tons and tons of new innovative burger joints in the Phoenix area. Harvey's Wineburgers never lets us down since 2009.  We continuously are never disappointed with the food or the service.  Freshly made burgers that are always thick and very, very juicy and the best burger by far, I think, here in town. The toppings to the burgers are always fresh.  No unripe or end tomatoes here. The bartenders and service have never disappointed us either. Mark is a great bartender!  He is always friendly.  Our favorite thing isnt even the burger, it's the onion rings!  I have always tried to figure out their sweet batter, but they are always perfect and a unique sweet flavor and freshly cut!  And yes, they are the best in town too!  They have several appetizers and other sandwiches that won't let you down.  What I love is its not  Scottsdale ridiculous prices for a burger.  So affordable that you dont have to worry about breaking your bank.  Dinner for two and a few pitchers of beers and shots and my wife's hard drinks, all for under $40.00.  You really can't beat that. Plenty of tvs, great music, and not a bad bar length if you like a bar to sit at and talk."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place with some work associates and the server was extremely rude. The food took thirty minutes to come out and it was not busy. When we inquired how long it would take the server stated \" this isn't McDonald's\". When I received my food my chicken sandwich looked like a round hockey puck. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Green chile burger and fries were amazing! My friend got the hot wings and said they were great as well. I didn't give them 5 stars because it was only one visit but I will update when I go back because I will be going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Based on Chad L's November 2013 review, I returned to Harvey's in March 2014 with a couple of friends.  Chad's report is correct, they have gone back to using the quality beef that kept them in business 40 years.  The sandwich is still a little smaller than the old days, but the burger is clearly hand made and absolutely delicious.  We are still debating whether you can taste the wine in the wine burger, that might require another visit or two.  They now offer a reasonably-priced lunch 'combo' that gives you great French fries (or their fabulous onion rings) with your burger in just enough quantity that you can finish them.  The table service is quick and as friendly as always. I will now put Harvey's back on my list of favorite (under $8) burger places in Phoenix.  Thank goodness for the new owners who have brought back tradition. You can't buy that \"homey\" feel elsewhere."}
{"text":"I totally stumbled on this place by being at the car wash next door!  We went in one night after a sports function for a quick bite to eat.  Damn...they are great burgers.  Reasonably priced food and drinks.  Fun \"dive bar\" atmosphere.  Great place and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"$30 for two cheeseburgers, two draft beers , a bottle of coors and a rum/ coke is too much.
In these hard times, it's ridiculous to not mention to the customer that fries are extra and will cost $6 on top of the $6 each for a burger. The burger was real good, but not worth $6 and it has shrunk. The order of fries was $6 and not worth it at all. I shouldn't have stopped, even though traffic was bad, I could have taken my wife to The Armadillo Grill for 5 star food / experience at this price, just across the street or gone to Aunt Chilladas and spent it on drinks and had free happy hour Mexican food.
The girl didn't even mention the fries were an extra $6  !!! Come on ! I feel raped !"}
{"text":"Great dive bar, saying that they always have drink and shot specials. Their burgers are above average for a restaurant let alone dive bar food.. I've heard they're patty melt is delicious as well.  Wings are ok, nothing to write home about.  The staff are friendly and will remember your name if you go in a lot and you may even get a free beer from time to time on the house.  They host dodgeball and dart leagues and even dress up and decorate the place when dodgeball have a theme night.  They have craft beers now and will ask us what beers we would like for the upcoming season.. Great dive bar, one of my favorites in Phoenix!  They have two pool tables, plenty of seating, big screen tvs everywhere, a new jukebox, and a dart board."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Make sure you have 40 minutes to wait for your average tasting burger. The fries tasted like they were frozen. The good 'ole boys who seemed to be regulars, were loud and disrespectful. It's your typical dark, old and average dive bar. Let's see, something positive to say... you can apparently bring your dog. Yep. Inside. Where food is being served. Awesome."}
{"text":"Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \"Do I want that to go?\" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?"}
{"text":"Its a local bar for sure. Only shock top and bud light on draft. They do have bottles of other stuff but you can drink bottles at home. I've had the patty melt and cheeseburger and both were exceptional. they don't give you enough fries with your burger. The daily specials are pretty good. Nice service and friendly people. Definitely 90% locals in there."}
{"text":"As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover...we walked into this place having many stereotypes like oh man, its gonna be a dive bar or u know...we're gonna be the only asians eating at this place, but it was GREAT. The lady at the bar was extremely nice and she even cooked our wine burgers right in front of us! Might be a poor man's version of benihana but whatever! still worth it! Definitely worth going, we went there everyday for 2 weeks straight, the wine burgers are delicious, and surprisingly so are the chili dogs! and very economical too! Awesome place"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while once I realized that it was actually still in business and not an abandoned building. My friend told me they had great burgers and I was like damn that place is open.  Than I figured I would give it a shot because I love a great burger and supporting local independent businesses.    

The cheeseburger was great.  It looked like the standard size is 1/3 lb.  It had a great char on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside.  I got the mixed basket of fries and onion rings which is enough for 2.  If you read some of my previous reviews you know I don't like to share fries so you know this was a big size of fries and onion rings.  Another great thing is that it was inexpensive $5 for the cheeseburger, $4 for the hamburger and $4 for the rings and fries.  

If you watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network they would refer to this place as a Dive and I think the people their would not mind.  The entrance was a metal door that didn't even have a door knob.  It was really dark on the inside and like most places in central Phoenix it was a small space.  It took about five minutes to get someone to notice us.  Once we got the attention of the waitress she was apologetic and seemed very nice.  The booths were really small and seemed to be made by someone who got a C in shop class.  The funny thing is about half way through our meal my girlfriend and I noticed that it was an about a 99% AARP crowd, even the employees.  I guess only the cool Gen X and Y know of the place.  

I will definitely be back again and again!!!  

P.S. BRING CASH BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a  local. Just saw it was close by when I was hungry thanks to Yelp. Pulled in lot and was concerned because looked like abandoned crack warehouse. But once inside a great dive type bar with pretty and friendly servers. Beer cold. Food good. Me like."}
{"text":"I love this bar and am fortunate it's nearby my house. They have several tv's, a couple pool tables, skiball, and the best, I repeat, BEST, burgers in town. They may be $8-10, but they're worth every penny."}
{"text":"Mark the bartender is amazing! Such a charismatic guy and is so polite. My first time visiting was unsure about a \"wine burger\" but I've tried beer bratwurst and I love those. The woman cooking my burger was also a blast and did a great job on my burger with how I wanted it cooked. Burger tasted great and loved that there was an option for pepper jack cheese! Will go back 10/10"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Harvey's. I was so impressed! The service was wonderful. The cook even came out to check to make sure we were enjoying our meal. The burgers were the best burgers I have had since moving to Phoenix. The restaurant it's self is no thrills but I would recommend it to anyone is craving an incredible burger and great service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and ordered food to go. Loved our Garlic Patty Melt and jalapeño bottle tops. Can't wait to go back again. Great little place."}
{"text":"Have driven by hundreds of times and decided to check this place out while getting an oil change down the road. What an amazing place! Bartenders are wonderful and friendly. The cook is amazing. Very diverse crowd. Food is very fresh. Had a hamburger, onion rings and fried jalapeños. It was delicious! Will definitely come back. Although this place has been around forever, it is extremely clean. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here to try the highly recommended wine burger. It was too greasy for my liking and I thought it tasted average, nothing you can't get at any other burger place. The place itself is very dark inside. They did have good drink specials but it's not somewhere I'll return."}
{"text":"Funky and Fun.....   Wineburgers are great..... I have tried several other bars in central phoenix that serve sandwiches and Harvey's on 16th street is tops.....  Good quality of meat, hand packed with grilled bun and pricing is very competitive..... a must try......."}
{"text":"Have been to Harvey's Wineburger twice.  Both times exceeded our expectations.. Their burgers are definitely the best I have ever tasted.  You are given the option for how cooked you want your burger. I choose medium rare and it was perfectly done. I ordered mine without the bun. The French fries are also hot and freshly prepared."}
{"text":"I have been a happy customer at this dark and inviting hidden jem for over a decade. The drinks are cheap and well poured. The burgers are probably the third best in the entire city, including the far pricier burgers. Staff is always sweet. Music sometimes a tad but too loud for hanging out, but other than that: yes yes yes on everything here."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is very friendly & the food is great for the price. Not to mention awesome drink specials ($3 for Grey Goose anyone?), and the bartender pours with a heavy hand. 
Very eclectic music and fun arcade games, though we didn't play any. Being it a dive bar, I had my reservations of the clientele in the place, but when we all joined in for a group rendition of some 80s love songs, I knew it was all good."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good but the service was wack. The bartender was acting like he didn't want to serve me and took a while to take my order. I probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, always an interesting crowd. The best cooks and bartenders. If only my arteries would let me eat here more often..."}
{"text":"I love the fact it's all ladies that tun the show when I was there during lunch time. They do a great job at it too. Burgers are very great.  Great daily specials. One of the best burgers in town"}
{"text":"Been going to Harvey's for years.  The place is a dump, but it is my kind of dive.  You have to get the Wineburger.  You won't be sorry!  One of the best burgers I've had."}
{"text":"Great food, like really good food but... Where is the management? 

Severely understaffed 90% of the time, I feel bad for the staff. You can tell they like each other but are put under way to stress and I saw the team work start to unfold. 

Management, schedule more than a bartender during lunch. 

Best,"}
{"text":"We stopping in on Friday about 5:00 just to check it out. Harveys is a neighborhood dive. It felt like Cheers when we walked in. People at the bar (customers) said Hi and the waitress was right to us with menus and very friendly. OK, don't expect much in decor. The tables are sticky, like when the varnish is sticky and you can never get it clean enough to not be sticky. We had drinks very nice martinis. The bartender is a pro. I had a BLT, thin sliced bacon, crispy and just the right amount and my partner had a burger, both were excellent. 
As we left the bar crew all said bye as well as the staff. I liked the folks there."}
{"text":"This place is The S%&t!!!

Yep, it's a dive and the sanity level can be questionable BUT

The burgers are awesome, in fact there is no need to order anything else.  The grill stays on so long as people are ordering food.  I have never once gotten sick from eating here.  They have a good pour, not crazy and not chintzy.  The price is right, there is ample parking and the staff are friendly.

The jukebox is a great deal.  I dare you to put a 5 in this eclectic machine.  Your selections will be playing long after you leave.

I would not ever recommend Harvey's if you are on a time constraint.  This a place outside of time for you to hang back in when you have the time to hang.  It's laid back, sit down and let the bartender know you are there.  Everything else will take care of itself."}
{"text":"This gets a 5 Star Dive Bar rating because it excels at things that make dive bars great:

1. Cheap booze.

2. Great food. Also cheap. Go for the burgers.

3. Jukebox with a solid 70s, 80s, and 90's selection.

4. Games. Pool, darts, and a vintage bowling arcade."}
{"text":"Best burger in town for the price.  A well cooked 2/3 lb burger for under 7 bucks.  Good potato salad as a side.  Sort of a dive, but friendly, with two pool tables."}
{"text":"what a great little dive came to try the burger heard great things about it boy they were all right it's not the most flavorful Burger but it is the juiciest one ever the bartender was super friendly asks your name introduced herself will definitely be back pretty soon because I am craving one of those Burgers right now"}
{"text":"In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches."}
{"text":"The burger here is actually amazing. You can subtly taste the flavor of the wine they use to season the burger but it's not overwhelming. Not too greasy burger in a well toasted bun that really comes together in a wonderful way. The fries are seasoned and tasty as well. Over all the food here is as good as everyone says it is. 

The atmosphere is classic bar vibe with a pool table in back. It's not upscale or trying to hard. This place knows what it is and does it's job well. I heartily endorse Harvey's Wine Burger. Go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! The food is amazing for sure. They have my favorite bourbon, Bulliet, on special on fridays. They play amazing music as well! They crowd is always very eclectic and the bartenders are attentive and very nice. I'm so happy I have found such an awesome local place!"}
{"text":"Love the neighborhood bar! Go in for basic bar food, which is made to order .. . .and drinks! Can't go wrong. No fancy schmancy here, just good service, good food and good times."}
{"text":"Take out for a burger takes over an hour, be prepared for your stomach to eat itself as the clock ticks down for the longest take out in human history."}
{"text":"This place is fun! Went here in the late evening on a week day with a friend who lives nearby. They play music (and sometimes everyone sings along!). Burgers are excellent. I ordered a protein style burger that I split with a friend. They actually brought it out separate for us along with the fries. Drinks were delicious. Service was speedy.
Also, they have a yelp check in special! Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I love me some dive bars!

Decent wings at best.
But the burger, yep, the burger was good!

Friendly service. Really dark. Fun atmosphere.

I'll definitely check it out again though!"}
{"text":"This was probably the best burger me and my father have had! Came here today (Tuesday) for the first time. Had the cheese wineburger lunch special for $6.50 and it was DELICIOUS. Also had a vodka tonic, and dad had shock top on draft which he really enjoyed. Nice father daughter lunch with beverages! Bartenders were very sweet as well. We will definitely be back! Thank you for a great lunch and drinks too."}
{"text":"If your looking for ambience or atmosphere, turn away. If your looking for a fantastic burger then this is your bag. I'd recommend takeout, that way you can enjoy the awesome burgers in a nice environment. When I first walked in, I felt like I was in Cheers and WAY out of place. I'm no rookie to the local hole-in-the-wall restaurant, so it didn't bother me so much. I ordered the normal Harvey Burger. The bartender/cook/probaby owner or something, pulled out the patties (which had been marinating in red wine and garlic, yum) and slaps em on the flat top grill. He then squirts on even more red wine as the burgers are cooking. I don't recall the price, but it wasn't too bad. Overall, great burger."}
{"text":"They've changed hands again.  I'd been going there fairly regularly for something like 20 years.  The guy who started it (Harvey, I presume) ran it for around 40 years, until he died.  His daughter ran it for another five years (about) but decided running a dive bar wasn't what she wanted to do with her life and put it up for sale.

It was bought by a Vietnamese couple who upgraded the interior.  They added a bunch of big flat screen TVs, started taking credit cards.  The place used to be cash only, although they did put in an ATM a couple years back.

Harvey's signature was the wineburger, hand formed from quality beef.  Always excellent,  But the new owners switched out for preformed patties of cheaper meat.  That was a spoiler for me.  And apparently not only me.  The last time I went there under those owners I was the only one there.  I wonder why they couldn't figure out where their crowd had gone.  I ordered a hot dog.

But apparently those owners dumped the place as a loser (said the bartender).  I went there last week.  Whomever bought it brought back the first class meat (98%) with fresh, hand made patties.  It's back on my recommended list.

What other people say about the ambiance is true.  It =is= a dive bar.  I mean that in the best sense.  Cheap drinks, a friendly crowd (many of whom seem to be regulars; they know each other)."}
{"text":"Running errands near Camelback a few Fridays ago, I found myself STARVING, yet having several more stops on my itinerary. The Yelp application on my iPhone (insert shameless plug here) showed that Harvey's was right around the corner, and with a swing of the wheel, I was pulling up to their dilapidated storefront. 

Being alone, I bellied up to the bar, which was packed at 2:00 PM on a Friday. I still had work to get done that afternoon, so I had to stick with an RC Cola (yes, you read that correctly.....RC Cola). Let me just tell you that I was the only person in the place that didn't have a beer in hand. Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's. 

Just a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd. 

Now, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \"wineburger\" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar. 

The burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese. 

Let me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself). 

The onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat. (I'm sure my doctor does not approve of this meal). All the condiments I could ask for were delivered promptly. The burger was hot, with just the right amount of grease, and full of flavor. This was as close to home-made as you can get."}
{"text":"Having been a patron for several years, I have come to appreciate the smooth taste of a wineburger. They have always been great, and I have never been dissapointed by their food, although their wings are WAY overpriced at only a half dozen for the same price you get a dozen anywhere else, and are decent, but not great. That said, we love going there!"}
{"text":"Never can one judge a restaurant by its exterior.  Whether that makes sense or not if you ever drive south on 16th street just south of Camelback you will see a small dive bar that says Harvey's. This place makes one feel like you got off a DeLorean when you walk in with that old 70's feel.  The wooden panels, the old Budweiser signs and yes that cheers like feel with regulars. 

They have good drink specials like 2 dollar Pbr's but if you are like me and need a quick lunch bite, come in for a burger.  They only have about 3 burgers and they are cheese, regular and I believe a double.  They are delicious and taste like a good homemade burger. 

They have happy hour weekly and on weekends but weekends they go a tad longer. The 6 dollar burger with fries and a drink is my bag."}
{"text":"This has become one of those must have places. Gotta stop in every time we're out this way. Service is awesome, food to match, laid back atmosphere just a great time and place to be at. You're gonna enjoy everything here!!! GUARANTEE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific burgers made as you order and as you desire it cooked. Totally bar and beer environment, but a great place to chill with a couple of friends or family over a juicy burger and a drink"}
{"text":"Nobody's reviewed this place yet?? Probably because nobody knows it exists. I didn't know myself. I could barely even find the place.

What a cool divey bar/restaurant. I along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they didn't disappoint. While not the best burger I've ever had it was moist and delicious. Apparently the burgers are saturated in Burgundy while on the grill which gives them their flavor.
Fries do not come with, which is always annoying, but we ordered a mix basket with onion rings and fries and it was quite tasty. 

Only down note; halfway through the meal my coworker claimed he found a long hair in his burger that he swore up and down wasn't his. Being a self-proclaimed \"goat\", he ate the burger anyway. I know this would warrant an immediate look of disgust and a one star rating by some....but shit happens. Hair gets in burgers. I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt. 

But if you are repulsed by such things, I would encourage you to come here anyway if only to have a drink, the place is pretty cool.

Oh and they do not accept credit cards, so bring some cash if you do not want to be charged a $2 fee from the ATM offered inside."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a dive bar. But it's one of the most interesting dive bars I've ever been to.
They only have 2 beers on draft, and only about 10 items on the menu. But it's just such an interesting place to hang out and play pool, darts, pinball, or the old bowling machine.
The staff are always very friendly (although some are a bit more wild and crazy than others).
All in all, the best dive in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Total dive bar - which is my kind of place. I bought the Amazon Local deal (punch card with 3 $10 credits) and came today to try it out for the first time.  Took a seat at the bar and got instant greets from bartender and the cook (score). Bottled beer came ice cold (score) with menu. Ordered Wineburger and fries $6 lunch. Condiment and napkin service appeared instantly (score). Watched some TV (no hassle about swapping over to golf) and burger came in decent time. PERFECT taste and doneness! Second beer delivered timely and no chasing someone down to pay and get back to work. Lunch experience awesome so don't be scared by other reviews if you work nearby and want good,  cheap grub, with friendly prompt service."}
{"text":"despite being in the most affluent neighborhood, they play rap music on and on. When a  customer puts on rock music, they put on they;re  favorite playlist . Which is rap music.
The clientel that frequents the place that  buys the premiem drinks and food are mostly non- rap fans.
I put money on the jukebox and the waitress clicked on a device and my songs did not play. The message on the jukebox was some name with free play. Which lead me to believe that the waitress  was the author.
I want my money back!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect burger and onion rings.   The 1/3 lb. Cheese Wineburger is the best.  The place is nice and cool for those hot summer day when you need to cool off have a cold beer and a great burger!!!"}
{"text":"I Recently moved to this part of town and was looking for a good neighborhood bar. I think I found it. This seems like a very laid-back, Unpretentious and \"cheers-like \" Atmosphere for the 30 and up crowd. Two pool tables, very nice and personable staff (offered to turn my cheeseburger into a bacon cheeseburger free of charge). Very diverse crowd and seems like everyone knows each other. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Had a wineburger with cheddar, bacon & mushrooms - awesome! Yup, place is a dive bar but, crowd is diverse (21-75/bikers to yuppies) and the burger - super juicy, great flavor, perfect!
Service was great. Beer was cold. Great way to start a weekend - We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place with super friendly staff.

Don't let the outside fool you, its bigger than you think! I have the Original wine burger cooked medium and a 16oz can of PBR (or 3) with fries.

Everything was good and the prices were fantastic! I'd recommend a visit if you're in the area and craving a burger that isn't comercially made."}
{"text":"A great Phoenician restaurant. Pretty simple: fried fare and alcohol. If you want quinoa, a spritzer, or some light fare at ridiculous prices while hanging with your Club of Dandies- this ain't for you."}
{"text":"Great place. Food was fresh, bartender was on top of it. What more can you ask for!?!"}
{"text":"DIVE bar, tiny bathroom that will make you feel like you're on a submarine.

Now that that's out of the way--the beers are dirt cheap and the signature WineBurger is downright delicious.  Servers are friendly.  This place should be on the short list for anyone in the area that wants to eat out or drink with friends on a budget."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it so much!! I don't  mind the divey old school feel, I just felt the burger was not all it's cracked up to be. It was juicy, but under seasoned, so it didn't have much flavor. The other thing I didn't like was the cold bun that seemed like the cheap pack from the grocery store. 

The fries and onion rings were good and I like that they serve them with ranch. 

Kudos to the waitress/bartender/cook!! She was working hard and seemed to do a great job juggling everything."}
{"text":"As usual the burger was so good, and the drinks so good I made a request for a Bloody Mark and got a strange look from bartender but he made it anyway, had never heard using bourbon especially Markers Mark 46."}
{"text":"I'm a country girl. I like BEEF - thick, juicy and medium rare :) - and well, Harvey knows how I like it. Let's just say I'm a fan and I keep coming back. Like a good woman would.. okay, okay.. 

Cheap beers, good burgers and a local crowd. This is one of my go to spots if I need to go out and not get dressed up."}
{"text":"They have a really good thick juicy burger.

Fries are decent and prices are fairly cheap, especially if you get the burger of the day."}
{"text":"This is horrible place to go  if your are Asian!!
They even serving you forever!!!!
Terrible  server and service ever!@"}
{"text":"It was a pretty good two hours killed here on a Sunday afternoon. Looked like a good majority of the regulars were on hand including one guy who claimed 35 years drinking at this establishment. It was dark inside, but they have some decent TV sets and most channels as well. It is a well dated place, but that usually means a good grill. I had to order the original for $7 and it was a good solid burger. Kept it simple with just grilled onions and watched the chef pour the signature wine, but you can't taste the wine. The fries were clearly old and stale tasting, but the friendly people and burger make it worth a return visit."}
{"text":"This is what I call a real dive bar. And truth be told I like to find a hole in the wall or dive bar to sometimes escape to. Yet I'm certain this one has probably seen better days. 

The bartenders are nice folks, the regulars I met were pleasant people and even friendly. The well liquor is rather bad, so I guess that makes the happy hour prices fair $2.50 for well drinks & $2 for beer. 

They serve food but I didn't try anything. Overheard they were having some cooler problems so I decided to pass. Most of what is on the menu will set you back about $8 bucks. But I saw that their burgers are hand formed not the frozen pressed blocks of beef so they might be as good as some people report.

They have really nice TVs and a few of them if you wish to watch something. 

But even though I want to like the place for being a dive bar steps from Camelback Road and holding on, truth is I have been to better dive bars with better menus and well drinks. Hang in there Harvey's."}
{"text":"We love the other wineburger on 19th ave so we thought we would try this one out. What a huge disappointment. The servers weren't very friendly, we ordered a burger, wasn't very good. Bloody Mary was very plain. 
The place was somewhat busy but it seemed like the servers just couldn't keep up. Really just not a good experience for us. 
 Will probably be awhile before we try it again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is hard to quantify. 

The atmosphere is dark, dreary and dirty and our waitress was tweeking.

The burgers are very good, no doubt about that. Every else sucks though; the  fries are bland, even the soda tasted stale and watered down. 

I can't comment on the beer as I didn't have any. 

There's nothing like a good dive bar/restaurant. Unfortunately, this is just a dive minus the positive adjective. 

The burgers are good enough to merit a 3 start in my opinion."}
{"text":"Some people go to McDonalds at midnight after a night out. But I make my way to the best juke box joint with the best burgers in town! Stupid good!"}
{"text":"The new owner nothing but class. He asked me to move my car that was parked next to the handicapped my fault but then he offered to watch my car if I were to move in the back what a great guy everything is good here you should come here for a $5 special every day of the week it is awesome"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and food. Juicy Burgers and crispy fries I absolutely love that the kitchen is wide open for everyone to see food being prepared. Projectors and TV's everywhere for the sports enthusiast. Pair of billiards quarter operated. Clean working dart board I'm surprised they don't have more than 1. Lagunitas Little sumpin sumpin on bottle . Even though I was at the other corner (by dart machine) waitress made sure my drink was full. Thanks keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries, cheap beer, chill atmosphere...doesn't get much better. Monty, Friday-Sunday grillmaster, is the shiz."}
{"text":"So me and my buddy (coworker who is hourly) decide to go to lunch today.  What's the catch?  We don't know where to go.  We decided to go somewhere we haven't tried before that was off the beaten path. Enter Harvey's. Er, well, actually we did the entering.

We get into the place and it is a narrow bar with a line of tables to the right. We sit. We wait.  Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.  Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink'  I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same.  She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.  I also ordered a mixed basket because (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) fries aren't included with the burger! THIS IS AMERICA PEOPLE!!!!!

Along with the burger and fries, we got a lot of time to chat.  and I mean a LOT.  They sure are generous with time!!! Eventually, I ask her to put it in To Go containers and they give us the fries and cokes free.

Also, just a side note.  Please eat your food before coming on to Yelp and reading reviews about the food you are eating.  Some of these reviews almost made me vomit... almost."}
{"text":"Do you like great burgers? Then this is the place! I do not consider this place a \"dive\" bar. A good old neighborhood bar better characterizes it.

I have had the opportunity to go there over 20 years ago as well  as a few time over the years and yesterday went there with my girlfriend. We had a craving for a good drink and burger. We were not disappointed. Especially my girlfriend who is vey picky about everything. They even made her Long Island Iced Tea to her liking, which is a fete in itself.

We started off with the jalapeno caps which was good. I had a cheeseburger and fries. She had the same but with onion rings. They were both perfect! Despite one girl working the tables and bar service was perfect. Cook brought our food out and was very polite and entertaining.

Look with all these high end burger places and bars out there they do not compare with this place. It is that simple. I have had crap food and service all over this valley. This was a pleasant experience. A nice Saturday afternoon lunch and drinks with no bs.

I will be going back when I have my burger craving again."}
{"text":"very hit or miss on this place...had a good burger once and then the next time i could barely eat it.  the package poorly so if your getting it delivered beware cold and unappealing.  just a heads up."}
{"text":"I don't know how you people can hate on Harvey's. Do you not want a place to go to when you don't want to try hard ... or at all? It's cheap. It's fun. It's the one place I would go in public wearing Uggs. 

Sometimes I just want to go somewhere where the real alcoholics hang out, or as I like to call it: judge free zones. 

If you are a lady and are relatively attractive (ok, if you are a lady), someone is going to buy you a drink. Maybe even several drinks. Sometimes that is nice. Sometimes that is creepy. You get both kinds at Harvey's. Get what I am saying? I carry a knife/wine bottle opener and some mace for protection when I come to this joint. Not kidding. Once I couldn't find my little wine bottle doohickey, so I brought an actual kitchen knife. You just never know.

Yes, my friends think I am weird.
 
Back to Harvey's. I only have one gripe to pick. The new jukebox. Songs are sometimes a dollar. One song ... one whole dollar. What are you, iTunes? Give me back the old jukebox where songs were 25 cents.

Also, I don't care what anyone says. Harvey's burgers are freakin' awesome. Sometimes I crave them and then feel sorry for myself."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of dive bars? Do you love a juicy burger for under $10? Drink specials for $3?Welp, then Harvey's Wineburger is your spot! I have heard about this place for years! Like i'm pretty sure my dad went here in college. Don't expect anything fancy - this is a dive with greasy \"bar food\"and cheap drinks. What is not to love?

We popped in here around 8:30p on a Thursday night and could not wait to try one of their famous burgers! I ordered the cheese Wineburger with American cheese and mushrooms. YUM doesn't even describe the goodness of this burger - it was super juicy and literally melted in my mouth. Not to mention, IT WAS HUGE anddddd....I ate it all! {#noshame}. It was under $10 and worth every penny. The best part, all of their Svedka vodka drinks were only $3!!! Yes, $3!! They even had cucumber! Um, yes please! They also have daily specials that are a steal - $6.50 for an entire meal, can't beat that! My husband and I walked out with 2 meals and 2 cocktails for under $25. 

We left SUPER full and satisfied. It was just what the doctor ordered after a long day of traveling and delayed flights. The service was also very friendly. We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harvey's now accepts plastic!

I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.  

While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!

Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.

YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!  

Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!

June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!!
Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!

And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of \"rodeo\" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up!
Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname.
Apparently, I am a \"prick ass bitch.\"  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!

Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best burgers you can get, anywhere.

Wine in your food is already the best idea of all time. Why not pour wine all over your burger while it cooks on the griddle?

This place is a classic Phoenix bar: established in 1950-something or whatever... in other words: it has been around for a while, so it must be good."}
{"text":"Harvey's makes an incredible burger, has the divey atmosphere I enjoy and has specials all day on week days which are fantastic. The alcohol is super reasonable especially on Sundays, the service is superb and I will continue to come back often."}

You my think it's easy serving the masses but it takes the skill that he possesses!"}
{"text":"Amazing onion rings and burgers to die for :) for a little hole in the wall restaurant there food is amazing! TRY THEIR PATTY MELT"}
{"text":"Dive bar feel, but possibly one of the best burgers I've had. Made to order and seasoned perfect. The wings are also good."}
{"text":"The menus are greasy.
The burgers are greasy.
They only take cash. 
Real cheese.
They'll let you drink the cooking wine if you ask nicely/persistently.
The beer is cheap.
Good soda syrup/carbonation ratio. 
Monty is A W E S O M E. 
Sleazy, sad, and mostly dark. 

The bottom line here is that this place predates your Delux burgers, Fatburgers, Vig uptown or downtown, or bougie artisan pizza joint by possibly a thousand years. Alas, this is true Phoenix- the Phoenix that existed when we were acres of orange groves, palm trees, peacocks, canals, and farmland. Way back when Phoenix was modestly larger than Palm Springs and a burger was a burger. 

And if the state of affairs at Harvey's bothers you, well, then it may be time to look inward my friend. :)"}
{"text":"Just plain cheap simple greasy food. 
The best a \"Hole in the wall\" can be.
Excellent atmosphere.
Love this place and will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Have been there about 4 times now, food is either good or awesome, sometimes it's extra awesome when they cook the burger exactly medium. I am a burger junky and this always hits the spot. They have always been super nice and the prices are great! I actually had a small problem with my bill once and they fixed it promply with no attitude :) Great neighborhood dive! Just wish I lived in the neighborhood so I could visit more often."}
{"text":"Know what you're in for when you walk in and sit down. Here's what Harvey's has going for it:

I'm a big fan of their food, especially the Patty Melt. I've also had their burgers and chicken strips and, although it's nothing groundbreaking and innovative, it's better than a lot of places that try to get fancy with it. It's a classic for a reason, leave it the hell alone.

The drinks are also awesome. Prices are about what you'd expect and are pretty decently discounted during happy hour and for their daily specials. I don't even know what they are off the top of my head, but that's what the internets are for, figure it out yourself, I'm not on the take.

Ultimately though, the reason I frequent this place and continue to go back is because it's chill, the staff is super friendly, and the patrons are generally not a loud, jackass-ish sort of crowd. Want to stop by for a drink with a few friends after work and not have to deal with a bunch of bullshit? Harvey's is for you. Also and maybe it's because I suffered through Scottsdale bars for a year (I'm not rich and/or good looking), but the staff has always seemed... normal. Yeah they're at work, but they'll shoot the shit with you and laugh at a stupid joke and sometimes offer one of their own. It's almost like this place is run by humans instead of booze dispensing automatons.

Oh and pool tables and darts are there too if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim I was going to go to the rokerij and I thought this place looked cool I think I'm going to have a wineburger. What a great burger and excellent service. I can't say enough about the friendliness of the bartenders I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So yummy! I recommend the Rodeo Burger however Joshua Mylo had the Mushroom Swiss Burger. Service was awesome very hospitable & friendly. Happy Hour midday Sunday!!"}

Their beer is pretty good and also their happy hours is legit save money eat good ohh yeahh!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Amazing burgers and great drinks. Service is fast and friendly. I'd highly recommend"}
{"text":"We were a little worried about the ambiance based on reviews, but were pleasantly surprised that the reviews were vastly exaggerated. The service was friendly but slow, it's meant to be a slow, leisurely, drink and socialize spot vs eat and run.  The food was good, although our order came out incorrect. They would've gladly fixed it but we chose not to based on time."}
{"text":"I just love Harvey's!  My wife and I go at least once a week, usually a few times.  The chicken sandwich with american, bacon, grilled jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, little ketchup and loads of Tabasco.  I haven't had anything else in months, but everything there is good.  Get your car washed next door while you eat (same owners).  Tip if you like to chow down, take the paper out of the basket and put it directly on the table.  That way you have more room to construct and get to work.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Favorite dive bar in town. Pool tables, Good beer and great burgers. Nice people working and just an amazing place to have a beer or 4. Will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Try calling to place an order for pick up, the person who picks up just keeps saying \"I can't hear you\" repeatedly 3 times before flat out hanging up. I call back a in a few minutes giving them the benefit that they are slammed. This time, whoever picks up the phone doesn't speak a word before literally picking up the phone just to hang up. The wait time once you get there is horrendous as well. If you can actually reach anyone on the phone, whatever time they tell you to come, add an hour to that. Just downright poor business."}
{"text":"I  had the same experience as John V in that there was only one person working and \"She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... read more »did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc.\" on our day, she was so drunk/on it, that she poured at least half a bottle of wine on our burgers and side of onions, but they were tasty, the most yummy burger and sauteed onions (they ended up purple!) i've ever had. it was so delicious i forgot about how unsanitary the place was...to bad she's the only one who cooks the burgers like that, must be the altered state 'o mind. i'd go back again, after a few drinks."}
{"text":"$8 for a bud light pitcher that contained 6 full glasses of beer. Nuff said. From the start the experience was great. Patty (not sure if correct spelling) was so welcoming and refused to let us sit at a table till she wiped it down even though it was barely dirty. I feel like that says a lot!!!  Can't wait to come back and try the food. Bc it smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Great burger for the price. Always friendly service. One of the oldest burger spots in town!"}
{"text":"Total dive bar, but so awesome! Definitely a cool little hangout spot. Not to mention, best food ever! The onion rings are delicious and I always get the garlic patty melt....absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was really good. I got a burger because that's what they're known for and it was delicious. Maybe being a little tipsy might have something to do with it.  My boyfriend hated the place. He hated the food and hated the server. She wasn't attentive at all. The wings were chewy,  which means they deep fried frozen wings. I tried to tell him he was being very critical.  
     The next time I went there, I was there with a friend and sans boyfriend. After a bit of drinking I decided it was time to go home. Earlier I convinced my boyfriend to give them another chance in the food department and picked us up some food to-go, burgers because they were so good. I live within walking distance from the place and when I got home, i noticed the burgers were practically raw. I called the bar and told them what happened, and they ask me to come back so they could replace my food. My boyfriend wanted no part of that, and wanted a refund for his food. After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.
     Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance. Before I left the bar, I checked my burger to make sure it was cooked all the way, and again it was raw. So I asked the server to have her cook it a little longer, and when I got home it was ok but then my fries were cold. All in all, it's a pain in the ass to try to get food cooked properly there. If you like rare hamburgers, this will be the place for you."}
{"text":"Late night munchies brought me too try this dive bar. Staff is friendly and accommodating. First time here, will be back next time for drinks as well :).

Buffalo Bleu Burger is a must try."}

{"text":"We went to Harvey's because reviews looked good. We went there for lunch. We drove up and noticed it was the dive of all dives, but since it was supposed to have good burgers, we went in. I have to say the Patty melt I had was very good. I could taste a slight wine taste. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich and said that was good too. So, I wish the bar was more of a restaurant atmosphere than a extreme dark dive bar."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place before and thought it looked cool...so, I wish my review was positive. 
We went on a Monday night so it was busy, and I get that, but that's when you ramp up your staff...you'd think. 
First there was no seating except for tables by the pool tables, so we were constantly in the way of the pool players, which is obviously not ideal. They should probably just remove those tables and put in a bar that runs the side of the wall. But I digress...
We waited over an hour for two baskets of mediocre wings, and drank beer from dirty bar glasses. (Ew.) When we finally got the wings, they weren't even super hot, like they'd be sitting around for awhile, and to top it all off: they were nothing special at all. The sauce was \"meh\" at best, there was no celery to be found, and there were a whole whopping 6 wings for $8.50.
The waitress was obviously trying to do her best on a busy night and gave us a couple of drink tickets to make up for the wait, so that saved this from being a one star review. 
Sad, Harvey's. Just sad."}
{"text":"Drinks are good and reasonably priced, cheap on hh. Food is hella good. Mozzarella sticks, Patty Melt, Super Burger...all awesome. Only two people working on a Sunday during NFL season, but it didn't matter. They were on point with the orders and its an enjoyable place. Dark and divey but a good vibe. I'll be back and I'm recommending it."}
{"text":"If I ever want to be reminded what kind of asshole I am, I just need to reread this review and I'll know. 

Why is this the review that will serve as this reminder when I have so many Yelps explaining so much about that already? Well:

I went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.

We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed. 

I was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor. 

The bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, \"Want menus?\" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos. 

AMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them. 

The one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him. 

All and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on \"anthropological journeys.\" 

Apparently, they put wine in their burgers if you're into that..."}
{"text":"Kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.  If I liked the burger, I'd recommend only ordering it to go.

I went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.  The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.  Combined with the atmosphere and general grungy feeling (I don't know how sanitary the place is, but I wouldn't bet on it passing inspection), I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"So so good! Some the best wings I have ever had, garlic Parmesan and medium sauce combo. Not on the menu, but ask for it and try the best sauce combination on wings ever. Dive bar vibes, with friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Would have given a 4 star if the service were more prompt with a bit more attention to detail. Burgers are good, especially the Spicy burger, and the Jalapeño Bottlecaps were my favorite among the appetizers. I'm thinking the bartenders were too tired after Happy Hour. Want to come back at a less busy time."}
{"text":"I've passed this place hundreds of times, and finally came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  This place is an unapologetic dive with a unique charm.  They do have a fun \"game room\" with a pool table and other bar games.  The menu is fairly limited to burgers, fries, and other traditional bar fare.  They also only have two beers on tap, Bud and Bud Light.  

I ordered the 1/3 lb. wineburger and a side of fries.  The burger was tasty but nothing to rave about.  They served a generous portion of fries, which, like the burger, were good but not outstanding.  Surprisingly the service was excellent, which may be due to it being a slow night.  The server/bartender/cook was very attentive, asked about the burger, made sure I always had a drink, and even repositioned the TV so I can better watch a preseason game.  

Overall, it was a good experience (3.5 stars if Yelp allowed halves).  The food is good (between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant), the prices are more than reasonable, and the service was great.  If I go back, I would definitely try the 2/3 lb. burgers, which looked like a better choice."}
{"text":"2 of my favorite things: wine and a burger combined together is SO DANG GOOD!  The fries were cooked to perfection as well. I couldn't stop eating!  This is a dark bar atmosphere and ate here on a sunny day early afternoon. Love eating in a dark bar during the daytime.  Everyone there was super friendly. I will definitely be back!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great service, friendly staff, decent beer selection and Amazing Burgers! Definitely a once a week burger craving.. Beer drinking kinda night place!"}
{"text":"So, this place is hands down one of my favorite places in all of Phoenix. They put in a great, large tv in the pool room and put in more tables. I finally stepped out of my box and ordered something other than the wineburger and I WAS NOT disappointed. Their garlic Parmesan wings are fantastic. Can't wait to go back in a few days!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Expensive beer. Extra star for playing Miley's \"I adore you\" while I'm out with my husbear"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I got the Tuesday special, , and then I checked in and received an additional 10% off. They get points just based off that, a lot of places have stipulations to the \"check in\" discount. 

On to the food, I got that wine cheeseburger it was amazing. I got my bread extra toasted. It was fresh and huge, it came with fries, all for $6. Definitely a win win. 

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  The food is great and the service the best! 

Mel, Margie and Monty we salute you. Thanks for everything you do for us."}
{"text":"This is the best dive bar in Phoenix.      Not the diveyest,   the best.    It's not the \"scary\" or \"rough\" sort of joint,  I never feel even the slightest bit unsafe here, nor worried about my car outside. 

If you're not into laughing, being positive and casual and openly social with everyone at a dive bar,    this place won't be good for you and you won't be good for it.      Take your negativity somewhere else. 

At Harvey's you can look like you just rolled out of bed or dressed up,  whatever, doesn't matter.     All that matters is everyone's there to be happy,  be themselves,  be friends.    

As for the food?     The burgers are unpretentious and have no real gimmicks,  you order a burger and it shows up and it's just an honest delicious  burger,  not too much salt or seasoning so you can taste the 
meat, the lettuce, the onion for exactly what they are - PERFECT!  

Update:  I invited my brother in law here,  and he refused because he says the wings are awful.    Well,  simple solution:  don't come here for wings.    It's Harvey's WineBURGER.     I'm not a wing person so I don't know first hand how their wings are.    Some other reviewers also said their wings suck so let's just go with that."}
{"text":"Hair in the food, not mine. Ewwwwwwww disgusting. Do not recommend.

How does this have 4 stars on yelp? Lol"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time since it just got sold again. BURGERS ARE BETTER THAN EVER!!!!!!!!!! Drink Specials are fabulous. Jessica the bartender is awesome. The New owners just Rock!!!! My husband has been going to this place since he turned 21, so for 25 years."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know the way to my heart is through a good dive bar. Harvey's is a pretty good one of those. PBR holds a special place in my heart, from my college days and I don't care if you make fun of me, I actually like the way it tastes. You can get a tall boy for like 2 dollars at Harvey's. 

I also really enjoy the food, they have weekly burger deals-which are worth it. I've had the classic wine burger-with cheese, the patty melt, and the chicken one. Don't get the chicken one, it isn't very good. I think it's just on the menu to have that option, but it tastes bland and like it came from frozen. 

The good news is, the other burgers are pretty spot on. I love the patty melt, it's open goey glory. The wine burger is flavourful and moist. The fries are pretty good too. I will say, there has been some inconsistency, it depends who is cooking. The guy with the beard does a great job. For the price though, and the excellent divey atmosphere, this place is 

I went here and waited 1:30 minutes for my food. We asked for water 3 times and never got them. This is terrible. I don't want to come back anymore"}
{"text":"Wineburger is one of those places you know you can go to when you need a decent bite to eat at a fair price.  The cheeseburger is decent - standard bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and cheese (no onion for me, thanks)... but little flavor.  My lunch companion said she tasted the flavor of the red wine but I couldn't.  The fries were surprisingly good, and the basket was enough to feed at least three people.  My iced tea was strangely bland, watered down, and sour, but not entirely unpleasant.  Our waitress was really good, though - attentive, friendly, and all-around pleasant.  Another important thing to note is they are a cash-only establishment.  They do have an ATM, though.  I don't think I'll ever find myself craving a burger from Wineburger, but if I find myself around 16th St. & Camelback without any other options, I'll likely stop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good and always fresh, never frozen. You can tell they use good quality ground beef. This place is definitely a hole in the wall but the food and service are good. We really enjoy the wine burger for something different but there are better burgers in town."}
{"text":"I've driving and walked passed this place too many times saying \"I gotta check this spot out.\" Well, that faithful day was today, and boy am i happy!! This spot is the premier location for simply good shit. ALL MY BURGERS FROM HERE ON OUT WILL BE OUTTA HARVEY's Also..be sure to ask Mark to wiggle for you--he does it well"}
{"text":"I have read the reviews on here, and decided to chime in.  First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.

Everyone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a true dive bar.

The service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.

Finally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.  They have a heavier hand in pouring than most college bars.

Overall, I recommend it if you like dingy bars and a good burger.  Sure, there are better burgers in town, but this is pretty unique.  A little more seasoning could be used, but it isn't bad the way it is."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! Best dive bar ever!!!
Low-key, out of the way-ish, great service & awesome burgers!!!
Great place to grab a quick bite during the lunch hour and/or a beer or three.

Come for the burgers, stay for the sports, pool, wings, PBR & darts!!
I've only been twice in 2 weeks but will be a regular from now on!"}
{"text":"Old school with a mix of regulars and newbs. Very relaxing atmosphere. 

The burgers are OFF the chain! Each one is cooked with burgundy wine to order (hence the name). Try the Wineburger with jalapenos.  

Lots of flat screens to watch whichever sporting event you are interested in. Just ask and they will find it.

Drinks are well priced and served quickly. 

The true star of this place is the staff. Funny, quirky and quick with a drink. Able to talk to and become buddies with anyone that walks through the door. Mel and Mark kept us laughing, fed and with fresh drinks every time we stopped in. 

This is not a hipster place, it may say 'wine' in the name, but this a is a bar that serves great bar food. And if you are a hipster, no worries, you will be accepted and treated like an old friend."}
{"text":"Okay i'm not mad, but i'm probably going to go back.  Like if someone suggested it, i'd eat there but just to be nice to a friend. 

I ate most of it.  the burger has a nice char, but really no special flavor.  I feel like this burger needs some seasoning.  It tastes like a burger that someone cooked in their backyard, but not nesc. in a good way."}
{"text":"My first time in this place and I definitely will not be returning. I walked in at 4:35 and sat at the bar. Was never greeted and after 5 minutes I addressed the bartender whose been in front of me the whole time. She responded with, yeah. I ordered and waited 20 and I noticed no one was cooking. I asked about my order, and it was only started after I complained. She responded with; I just put the order in ( as if to say it's not my job) I waited 40 more minutes. I saw my order was done and waited 5 minutes after she rang the bell. I had to request to have my order from the cook directly. The bartender was rude, un applogetic, and pushy. As a first time customer I would not return.

It was apparent the employees were unhappy and overworked. I should not have to take attitude from the whole staff."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries...for a bar this place had some awesome food.  Kinda load, but it's a bar.  Service was friendly and on point.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! I love that they have take out. I want to come and get a drink sometime too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Been a while since first review but this a 5 star burger joint.  Simply great.  Hard to out do!  Come see for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This place is after my heart. 

1. Dive bar

Reasonable priced drinks, specials always available, low key atmosphere. Only thing I would change is maybe turn down the volume on the music a bit (especially when the pop music gets a bit out of control) and fix the thermostat so its consistent and not extreme in both rooms. Those two things fixed and it would easily be 5 stars.

2. My favorite burger in town

UHMAZING WINEBURGERS. I didn't even know wineburgers existed until I moved here. Thank god I moved here. Now, keep in context what this place is and is not. It's not a gourmet burger joint. It's not extremely creative burgers with the best there is in ingredients. IT IS a dang amazing, done right every time burger. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy, just good eats. Not to mention, when they run out of burgers (which happens) the rest of the menu is well worth checking out.

3. Pool tables

Fun past time and offers a little activity while slinging beers and noming the night away. Just a past-time I personally enjoy. :)

4. Fantastic staff

Friendly, yet not fake. They'll have a good laugh with you and banter. They know what they're doing and the service is good."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar with cheap drinks, pool tables, and some decent food. It doesn't try to sell you on anything it's not and delivers well on what it is!"}
{"text":"Well the service has really taken a turn in the wrong direction. From no refills unless you walk up to the bar and ask for it to the staff forgetting or messing up your order.

I am very disappointed with this place now. I have started going to one of the other Winebureger? and have grown to like the food and the staff much better so this will be my last time at this location unless I hear on this site that the staff has changed.

I only gave them 2 stars because the food is still really good even if the staff is very unwelcoming.

I hope Harvey reads this review if he even exists."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my post-workout bowl of Chili and pitcher of beer and was IMPRESSED! Didn't want fancy- I was in my gym clothes. If you love a dark dive with really good food and prices this place is for you... The cook was visible and very friendly as well and the bartender was cool. The ladies was acceptable. The only thing missing was a smoking patio. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's a dive bar where they make \"wineburgers\" on a flat top behind the bar. It smells of cleaning products, stale beer and grease. It's nothing you don't expect and everything you would."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to come to hit rock bottom after a long night of drinking.The first time I wound up at this place I was already plastered and someone thought it was a good idea to pop in here for \"just one more\". It was fun because we were messing around in the game room adjacent to the bar and dining area. They have pool and shuffleboard and this VERY old retro bowling game with plastic pins. It really was good times. They have a good jukebox and we wound up slow dancing to \"Wonderful Tonight\" with the smell of rancid grease in the air right as it was last call. 

Not quite as enjoyable when you're sober and/or it's still daylight.  I've been back a few times and each time have thought \"God, how did I end up back here???\" We actually came for food and drinks one time. Against my better judgement and because no one with me cared to intervene, I ordered a chili dog. Needless to say my intestines were doing gymnastics for the next two days trying get the horrid thing out of my system.  So I strongly advise against eating here. I am by no means a healthy eater but I think I've discovered my grease threshold here at Harvey's. 

Much like a trip to Walmart at Christown, I always feel a desperate need to bathe after I visit Harvey's. The drinks here however are VERY cheap. If you're short on cash and just need to knock back one or two you'd probably be OK here."}
{"text":"Just want people to know this place has the best burgers in town. The staff is great and the people are friendly, very accommodating for group get togethers it's awesome to see the owner step up and make this place even better. If you are looking for a good time at  wonderful price this place is for you."}
{"text":"Love it!

Burgers are awesome. Cheap beer, and whackadoodles everywhere!!
Prices are spot on and the service is prompt and friendly. 

I love dive bars with great food and this place is Great!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Just don't do it. I went with some co-workers for lunch. We waited over half an hour just for our food to come out, and the place wasn't even busy. Our server had a horrible attitude the whole time since and when we asked why it was taking so long for the food, she replied \"we aren't McDonalds\" and slammed our checks on the table. My chicken patty came out like a brick. It hurt my teeth to bite into. I got sick from it as well. It was my first and my last visit to this establishment. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was hit or miss. The waiter would disappear for extended periods of time, which was somewhat bothersome but overall was made better by delicious food. The cheesewineburger was excellent, and I liked the fries so much that I ordered some more.

Keep in mind, looks can be deceiving. It doesn't look like much from the outside but Wineburger is definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"As far as Wine Burgers go... this is the Best place for a juicy burger. Very tasty and cooked perfectly. The onion rings are also amazing!

This is a great little dive bar. Good prices and great food. What's even better ..they are only 10mins away. 

Reason for the 4stars.  My beer was a little warm off the tap. Otherwise everything else was perfect..including the service."}
{"text":"Last night I was feeling low on disposable moolah$ and fiercely craving a REAL hamburger. There was a place in the 'hood I was dying to try...and guess I'll continue dying because they were closed. *sigh* So I had my adorable better half whip out his Yelp app (yes, he actually whipped it out, it was epic!) and looked for other burgeries in the area. Since I was already heading up 16th Street, we made a beeline for Harvey's (one of those places we had driven past thousands of times, looked at interestingly, and continued on our merry way without stopping). 

I'm happy we stopped in. I *heart* dive bars w/ good food...and this is the diviest one I've been to in forever  (and yes, that includes my escapade to the Brass Rail last weekend). 

The Bears vs Cowgirls game was playing, the joint had about 6 other people enjoying cold ones, and we sat at the bar. After what seemed like FOREVER, the bahtendah came over and took our order and gave us a couple of menus. There isn't much on the menu. There doesn't have to be, from what I can tell. I ordered a cheesewineburger w/ onion rings, and my schnookums ordered a cheesewineburger w/ fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries...but these were scrumptious and crispy and thin. The onion rings were so good, (crispy outside, soft onions inside) it felt like they were actually melting in my mouth. The burger absolute perfection, from the soft bun and juicy meat to the fresh lettuce, tomato and onion adorning it. I added ketchup and mustard to mine and it was simply heavenly. 

The bartenders are friendly without being annoying/hover-y...in fact, you may need to flag one down if you want another drink, but it was exactly what I was looking for and I will definitely stumble my way back there again instead of always driving by.  Next time I think I'll try the wings."}
{"text":"What's not to love about a classic dive? Do you like:
Cheap beer?
Fantastic people watching?
Duck Pin Bowling?
Awesome griddled burgers?

Sure, it's not much to look at, interior or exterior, but it's good fun all around."}
{"text":"Do not let appearances fool you. Yes, it is a divey looking bar, but they have delicious food and for a decent price!!! I ordered the chicken strips which came with fries. The chicken had a really nice crunchy outside and the inside was super juicy. My bf ordered the garlic parmesan patty melt. The patty's are all made with a little bit of red wine. I wasn't sure if I could taste the wine or not but it was delicious either way. The patty melt had a garlic parmesan sauce on it with bacon, onions, and grilled mushrooms. The mushrooms were strange. They had really good flavor but we're a little rubbery in texture. I wasn't really sure what that was about. However, eating the patty melt as a complete sandwich with everything in a bite was great! I felt like it tasted like it should sit really heavy in my stomach but it didn't and that was a nice surprise. They have food specials Monday through Friday and happy hour 3-6."}
{"text":"Honestly for a Bar, This place has really good burgers. Great Prices, Amazing food and services. Thank you."}
{"text":"Best damn patty melt ever.  Place is super friendly with a green Shape of Water movie lighting theme.  The soda glasses are the red ones I use to see at Midwest steakhouses.   Crowd is crunchy friendly and eclectic.  My patty melt was on real rye bread and the meat was not the frozen brick but real ground beef.  The onions were the perfect amount and the cheese was super yummy.  They also have daily burger specials and the onion rings taste hand made.  

I'm eager to swing back to this tasty nearby dive soon.   Really soon!"}
{"text":"Would have given a five star but the $3 salad was the worst. It was just a bowl of lettuce and some chopped tomatoes. Onion rings awesome perfectly cooked. Cheeseburger great flavor. Awesome fireball shot $4.50 but $3.00 on Monday."}
{"text":"Did this place change hands or something?  This has always (for over a decade) been my go-to for a burger and a drink. I came in today and the woman cooking the burgers is as slow as can be - more interested in visiting with her buddies at the bar about personal stuff than actually doing her job and making some burgers. The drink tasted like an airline drink, not the usual quality that I have come to know. Seems like they are resting on their laurels and depending on increased business from new apartments and not providing the quality service, food and drink I've come to know. It's very disappointing."}
{"text":"Recommended by a co-worker, and out looking for some grub I decided it was worth a shot.  Definitely a dive as described, but reasonably full so I stayed.  The service was a little slow, and the food kind of blah, but the cheese wineburger was decent if bland.  The chili cheese fries came out on a huge plate and the fries were not great, the chili tasted like it came from a can, but the cheese and onions were real and fresh.  I didn't realize it was RC Cola, which I did not enjoy, but the price was good and it was an interesting place to sit and people watch.

/overheard \"I don't do anything downstairs!\""}
{"text":"This place is nasty. The burgers taste gamey. Definitely not beef. Possible cat or human. (Just a guess) and the server repeatedly forgot about our table. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall bar WITH great goddamn burgers!!!! Had the Mushroom Burger and it melted in my mouth, was really impressed with their burgers! All in all I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Don't let the looks fool you, the grill is great here. The Reuben is as good as any I've had. I like it here to get out of the bright desert heat and have a cold draft to cool my heels for a few. The specialty is the Weinburger grilled 'ground chuck soaked in wine' on an ample bun. They've been around for a long time for a reason; lots of personality."}
{"text":"Decent burgers here.  Didn't live up to the hype, though.

One thing that concerned me was the gal cooking the burgers had long hair that was not tied back.  Just an FYI in case you're squeamish about plucking hair out of your food."}
{"text":"Burgers don't get any better than this. When I got to Phoenix, everyone said that Harvey's Wineburgers are the best in town, and I agree. You don't come here for ambiance, you come here for good food. Be sure to try the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Yummy fatty burgers! Cooked in butter, and taste so delicious! It is a bar atmosphere. Known for their burgers, it's the best thing to pick on the menu."}
{"text":"OK so I went with Chris T. here and here is the thing. . . I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. . (( and this place is what I consider a \"dive / hold in the wall\". . )) usually have really good food. 

So here is my review. And I will have to break it down into categories. 

---------Environment:****
Here's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This \"aint\" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.  
Harvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new \"joint\" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.  

---------The Wait: ---------**

As we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order. 

---------The Food: --------- *****

If it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries. 

I have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .

I have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch \"and I plan on going back\" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait. 

---------Over all score: --------- ****
 look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this. I will have to see if the time service issue is the same next time. 

Until next time. . keep the groove and be cool.  ."}
{"text":"Great little dive near the Biltmore. Some of the best burgers I've ever had, though they removed my favorite from the menu (oh please bring back the saucy burger, I need that A1 laddled bacon covered deliciousness in my life). 

They have two pool tables and a machine to despense quarters, and you can order from either the bar or from the billiards side and they'll even deliver to your table. Their drink prices are a bit higher than other dives near by and their burger prices are a bit steep but for $10 you are getting a huge burger! And definitely try their garlic sauce, it goes great on everything.

Perfect casual place to bring a friend visiting from out of town or coworkers after a long shift, it does get quite busy and there's no smoking patio but ample parking and I've never had a problem finding a seat. Their pool tables aren't emaculate but their cues are in good repair and they have many to choose from. They even do a Sunday pool league. They also offer a burger of the day from their menu so you can save a few bucks by coming in on your favorite's day!

The clientele range from the usual rowdy day drinkers to more hipster PBR fans but everyone has always been friendly and talkative."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The staff is great but the crowd is kinda rough. Some older women finished our game of pool while we were eating (she was by herself), when we gently asked her if she was done using the table, she said we could play her for it on our dime. Ha! Some guy had bought us shots before my friends boyfriend showed up and he continued to stare at us and whisper as the night went on. The old man playing the table next to us was very drunk and kind of aggressive, loud, and inconsiderate. He was constantly in our space. Just regular bar sleaze, would definitely take the food to go next time."}
{"text":"Standard dive bar....minimal decor, regular crowd, sports on tv, cheap drinks ($2.50 wells and $2.75 bottled beer during happy hour). 
BUT they have the wineburger!
It's delicious, it's cheap, and it's a phoenix classic. 
Highly recommend stopping in once in a while for anyone in the area. 
And kids are welcome!"}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good. At $8.50 though, it wasn't cheap. There's no natural light in here, so it feels like a post apocalyptic bunker. A little depressing.

Great if you're a junkie or 24 hour alcoholic, though."}
{"text":"Don't let the dive bar interior put you off. Even as we walked in, a bar fight was about to happen, but that just added to the experience, right along with the sticky tables and low lighting.
The waitress/bartender was really nice and both my mother and I got the burger and fries with sodas. The cook came over and asked us if we were sure we didn't want any add-ons so we just told her to throw some mushrooms on mom's and bacon on mine. She was a proper hole-in-the-wall fry cook with big hair. If laws didn't prohibit it, I have no doubt she'd have a cigarrette hanging from her lips.
The food was a surprise. While extremely greasy (you're getting a burger and fries so never expect less), it was also extremely delicious. Perfecly seared, thick-patty burger (with a unique tartness from the wine) on fresh bread with nice thick-cut bacon and great fries. It came with some onions and lettuce to top, also fresh. 
A perfect example to never judge a book by its cover. There's a reason this place has won some \"best of\" awards."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving wings.  Omg Leo the chef rocked the wings and fries. Bonus: daily special PBR and a shot for $3.75 BONUS!!!  Desiree, the Bartendor is super nice, funny and attentive!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Not your everyday trendy burger joint. It's more of a locally owned and operated family business. Your friendly neighborhood joint.  Service was outstanding, attentive and friendly. We sat at a table not too far from the bar and was greeted as soon as we walked in.  There were 3 of us. We all ordered cheese burgers and we all thought they were out of this world.  Who could ask for more... Great service... Great food... And great prices...  We will definitely be back soon and highly recommend to all. 
. Thank you !"}
{"text":"This place is always so great! Classic burger on a flat top, great service, low lights dive bar that is really cool! Melissa was awesome behind the bar and Patty is so great on the grill!  Real food, real people, Merica!"}
{"text":"Cheers semi-dive bar indeed but also a sports bar or is it a burger pit??? Actually its all three rolled into one very quaint but a total relic. It's been here as long as I can remember and unfortunately this is my first stop. While Phoenix continues to grow there are a few oldie but goodie stops this one included. It's now made it to my top list of favorite places to eat. 

Every night there is an amazingly priced special and where can you eat a meal for around $10 bucks!

First, I'd like to mention by no means am I a burger connoisseur. Truth is...I'm not into eating burgers but hands down this was the best patty melt I've had in a while! They went old school style with rye bread and this place actually makes burgers from fresh hamburger not some pre-made patty. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came exactly as such! Shoot, I can't even do that at home! 

We arrived and only a few patrons saddled up to the bar. It seemed like they all knew each other, a bit of an eclectic non-pretentious group. There were a few pool tables and a small dinning area. The bartender/server greeted us immediately and within a few minutes got us our drink order. 

Shortly after we arrived the place filled up and without hesitation the bartender was doing loops around the entire place without skipping a beat. Made my head spin really just watching her. Big kudos to her and to the cook! 

Everyone must go at least to try the patty melt if nothing these! And if you want to catch a game, there are enough TVs to go around for about 1 per person - no kidding! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"That old bar smell.

This goes way beyond dive bar.  I commented to my friend about the couple on barstools, 'those two are \"leaving las vegas'!\"   

Does any establishment need 40 taped up signs warning the would-be patron of their rules:  \"NO CREDIT CARDS\" --and someone wrote by hand, 'EVER'.  and \"NO GUNS\" and multiple \"NO SMOKING\" 

I ate the burger and I lived, though the meat tasted old I figured it was soooooo overly cooked that I probably was safe.

...Jesus!  I just read the review about them having cooler \"problems\"."}
{"text":"This place is everything a dive bar/burger joint should be.  Open late with cheap beer and greasy burgers.  Not a fan of the chili they use for the fries though.  Service was super friendly, and the burgers are cooked where everyone can see...kinda good, since you would expect some iffy situations in the back if you couldn't see exactly what they were doing to your food.
I'll be back, it'll be a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"12/20/2016-do you know Monday's are $5 Wineburger Mondays?  They are. 

Yesterday I was served a PERFECT cheeseburger. Ordered \"medium\", it was served perfectly medium. I ordered it with cheese, that's extra, well worth it. 

Two more things: there's a new owner and the bathrooms  are much cleaner!

Second, I hadn't been to Harvey's in quite some time, this was a year ago or so, but I walked in and April, the bartender said without hesitation, \"Coor Banquet\", which IS my beer. Pretty good!"}
{"text":"Yup, I'm a fan!!  Seriously, how have I never been here.  My friend used to live in the area and she told me about 6-7 years ago that this place was good.  It just looks kinda scary from the outside.  I mean I felt like once I walked in, the music would stop and everyone would look at me.  I climbed that mountain and finally visited with the BF last Friday.  We almost turned away because we didn't have cash on us, and didn't feel like hitting the ATM inside, I mean we got back in the car, talked for a second and then said what the heck!  

Walked in to a tiny little place with a LONG bar!  There were probably 4 people at the bar, and 3 people in the game room playing pool.  They had the classic MLB game on, it was like Blue Jays and Astros, funny uniforms! It was maybe 2pm.  So the bartender says, What can I get for you?  My dumbazz says \"Can I see a menu\", this is where the music would have stopped.  WHOOPSY, there really isn't a menu, its kind of like a snack bar, where you look up, make your choice and its done.  Burger or Dog, Fries, Onion Rings or both!! DUH!  The bartender was nice though, I wanted draft the BF wanted bottle so he suggested I get a small pitcher, it's the cheapest way to go...SOLD! Don't have to pull my leg, thats for sure!  

So, I ordered the cheeseburger, and the BF orders the gigantic chili burger, which was reduced to the smaller one by recommendation of the friendly bartender. BF sort of put up a fight, but the bartender assured him it would be plenty and if not, the next one was on him.  This turned out to be plenty for him, and I was thankful too, we had a long night ahead of us.  Much to our surprise, although I'm not sure what else we were thinking, bartender grabs a handful of meat slaps it on the flat top smooshes it down, and thus our burgers were born and cooking.  I mean, for real?  Man it was soo good, greasy yes, but everything a burger should be!  The last bite of course was the best, it had me looking for my other half, since I always cut those suckers in half.  I don't eat burgers often, but I can't wait to take my dad here, I might have finally found one place in town he's never been too.

While we were finishing up, a couple came in and sat next to us, who appeared to have just finished a golf game.  They ordered shots of Patron, I don't know how we got out without doing one with them.  The lady on the other side of us was getting her car washed next door so she said she comes in every time.  It was funny because the guy next to her, was hitting on her, and instead of asking her what she did for a living he asked her what her talents were!!  FUNNIEST thing ever!  Anyway, great place, great dive bar atmosphere!  Casual is as casual does."}
{"text":"After eating the burger and fries I quickly decided this place will be a regular for us... Love that it's a dive bar as well .. Warning ! The burgers are very greasy but so worth it ! And the buns are grilled with a little grease too :) I usually don't eat my buns but at this place I did and will.  I'm not hungover but this is prob a really good hangover burger too !!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The times where it's good, it's really really good and you can't wait to go back. However, last time I went there with my girlfriend it was sub-par at best. All the fried food in the sampler and the French fries with the burgs were overdone. Burg fell completely apart after one bite. Disappointing because I've been here several times and I know what this place is capable of. Hope it's better next time!"}
{"text":"Went to check it out. 
The daily special was the cheeseburger and fries and we had the jalapeño caps. They were interesting. Food was ok. 
Music was really loud. 
Staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Oh man, this is a dive bar at it's finest.  Total divey joint and a little sketch looking from the outside. This was a hangout of a friend's grandpa back in the day, and I'm pretty sure it's still the same décor FROM back in the day. You walk in, it's totally dark inside so it could be noon or 2 am in there, ya never know.  But we came for the cheeseburgers because we'd heard how fantastic they were.

They were.

Handmade juicy burgers chargrilled.  Toasted buns. Oh man.  Perfectly cooked fries. You get a boatload of fries/onion rings so order one basket because 3 of us shared.  

You want some great people watching and an amazing burger?  For cheap?  Come here."}
{"text":"YumBallz!!! Best wings & bloody Mary's in Phoenix!! Their burgers are just other worldly!!! You know something's good when u can't decide between this & lobster! Food here is THAT good! Made the right choice! Erik is the best grill master in town! Karaoke singers are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Standee was awesome server and the burgers were amazing and onion rings were so fattening but great, lol. I definitely would recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: I love dive bars. 

This place is IT. 

Tiny lil dirty, cozy bar. Pool tables, darts, sport ball games on tv, great tunes on the jukebox, friendly bartenders. We watch our Wineburgers get tossed onto the griddle, along with a giant pile of onions, getting slow cooked with wine while we sip on cheap beers in ice cold glasses. 

Don't get the Super Delux Wineburger unless you're REALLY hungry. These burgers are hearty. Especially since they come with fries. And you know you're getting a drink or two. Onion rings are pretty alright, so get those if you're still hungry.

We came in on Friday night and got to watch the adorable cook dance and sing to Bruno Mars blasting on the jukebox. You should come for this alone. Such a great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back for happy hour or late night shenanigans.

Personal sidenote: I told my mom I came here and, like everything else I think I've had a first experience at, she very calmly informed me that I've already been when I was young. I love my parents. Bringing kids to bars since the 90s. No shame."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! My burger was better than any other burger I've had at any restaurant. It was huge and juicy and cheesy. I got a Deluxe Burger with mushrooms and bacon. It was the best. I got onion rings and cheese sticks. The onion rings are battered not floured and the cheese sticks were just okay for $8, but $10 for the best burger I've had...I'll be back! Plus they're open late!!!! My new spot!!!! I wish I could have shown you a picture, but the dang thing was gone before I could even think about it! :-)"}
{"text":"I came here after my cousin recommended I try it.  When I walked in I was reminded of the bars my \"cool aunt\" took me to in Chicago \"neighborhoods\" when I was a kid.  At first glance it looks like a dive... But closer examination reveals the place is actually really clean and has a lot of character.
The burgers are the best I've had in recent memory.  I usually don't like burgers unless they're really good.  Chuck box and Portillos are two I like.  This place tops them both!  
If you wanna try a good burger in an interesting place give Wineburger a try."}
{"text":"Been there a ton of times over the past 30 years. Same great burgers and fries, people, choice of bud and bud lite...  Its a dive. Great place to go for lunch but maybe not the best place to impress the ladies. 8)"}
{"text":"This burger is so good! This place is a total dive, which is part of the charm. It feels like it's 2am inside regardless of what time it is outside. Burger was one of the best I've had. Service was a bit slow, but nothing major. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me say this, I have searched my entire life for a burger as delicious as the one I recently enjoyed at Harvey's Wineburger.  This burger had more flavor than any that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  I had the garlic patty melt, with a side of onion rings.  The patty melt included this amazing garlic parmesan sauce, along with the crispiest bacon I have seen.  The only potential drawback to their burgers is that they are so juicy that they are messy and soak through the bun.  However, that does not matter to me because the flavor was unreal.  My only regret is that I have lived in Phoenix for 13 years and this was the first time I visited. Needless to say, this will not be the last. This has now become my go-to restaurant that I will be taking out of town visiters to."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Harvey's Wineburger and would put it in my top 5 burger places. Cooking the burgers with wine makes they flavorful and juicy. They have daily specials and on Mondays you can get a burger with fries for only $5, $6 on Tuesday's to add cheese. The chicken fingers and southwestern egg rolls are also very good. The drinks are inexpensive and the atmosphere is very relaxed. This place is divey, let's just put that out there, but it is clean and there are tv's a plenty."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during my break, awesome food. Surprisingly good for a hole in the wall dive bar. They have great lunch specials and listening to the drunk locals is always entertaining."}
{"text":"The very definition of a dive bar w a food problem. They won best take out for good reason. Don't need a menu just get a burger you can't go wrong. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is seriously a hidden gem! Right off the corner of 16th street and Camelback. The burgers are cooked with red wine and you can really taste the wine once the burger is cooked- added with the cheese and awesome fries, this place is killer. they also have a sweet lunch menu deal that includes fries for like $6!"}
{"text":"Came here one night after dinner at Durant's. COMPLETELY different scenes but this place is fun. Great service and cheap drinks. If you're looking for a high-class joint; this def aint your place-but if a chill neighborhood bar is what you're after, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is a throwback dive and I love it. The burger is of great size for the price. The bar staff is super friendly and you don't feel guilty for having a beer at 11 AM there cause you are not the only one. I frequent this place usually after a round of golf for a nice cold beer and burger and has now become somewhat of a tradition. Do not let the outside fool you."}
{"text":"Best place I've been to in Phoenix by far! I love their food & atmosphere l! If you're looking for a great place to hangout with good food and people this is the place for you and friends check it out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar.  If you want to feel like a regular, even when you're not, come here.  They'll get your name and use it - a friendly hello and goodbye.  All with a genuine smile.

It's not what you'd expect from an iconic dive like this - but that's exactly why I come here.  Oh - and the burgers are damn good.

Come here on a Sunday for a hangover cure and football on tv."}
{"text":"The Bartender made me feel at home! I found her drinks were tasty at a great price and there was no wait. Very friendly atmosphere that would defiantly make me come back again. Not only was the service amazing, the Wine Burger with grilled onions and cheese was phenomenal. One of the best burgers I have ever had. There were tons of fries in a basket a friend and I shared. Definitely  will be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"We came here when dinner at home became ruined. We looked for places that had happy hour til 7. This place has great reviews so we give it a try. When we walked in I almost felt home with the dive bar ambiance it had. They had TVs, good music, and drink specials. We ordered the special of the say which was the patty melt and wings. It took 40 minutes until just the patty melt came out. About 10 minutes later the wings came out. The bartender never really checked on us until it was well over 30 minutes or apologized for the food being late. Up until the food issues I thought I'd come back but when it took that long and the food was mediocre we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The best burger in Phoenix! It looks like a dive; well that's because it is! Not a lot on tap but try the burger! Not the sexiest atmosphere, but did I say try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices, and Awesome Happy Hour! Place is small and quaint! Friendly staff and great service!"}
{"text":"Just got back from having burgers at Harvey's and I am BLOWN AWAY! Haven't been for a while and decided today was the day to rekindle our friendship :) The burgers are AMAZING!!! We had the rodeo burger and the garlic patty melt which had to be one of the best things I've ever eaten!!! I am worried that I will be there every day for a burger and fries now!! Anyone who likes beef and garlic should try that patty melt! Out.of.this.world.!! The beer was ice cold too which is always a plu"}
{"text":"We have given this place a few more tries.  We miss Jessica!!!

The food is still awesome!!!

The bartender is totally opposite.

We'll try back and if the rude one is still there we'll walk out and go to Zipps.

Too bad because we love this place!"}
{"text":"Never, never would I walk into a place like this unless A. I wanted an experience that I haven't had in several decades; B. I wanted a hamburger; C. My friends made me do it.

A. Wrong answer. This is a bar. There are reasons why people visit bars. If that's what you are looking for, then this place would be fine, I think. Check the other reviews for that answer though. 

B. Wrong answer. The wine hamburger was tasty and the fries hit the spot. The meat tasted fresh and mine was cooked through. I noticed pink in my hubby's meat (which is the way he likes his). I like mine well cooked, so I asked if when the burgers where ordered, if he had specified how we wanted the burgers cooked. The answer was no. Score. Unless I just couldn't see the color of my meat because of the lighting. Scary.

C. Correct. Sometimes when you are with a group of people, you just go with the flow, particularly when you are with people in their late 20s. However, when my husband and I were challenged to a game of pool at one of the two tables, the place scored some stars."}
{"text":"Now, this place is a good place. Always friendly, food is excellent, good daily alcohol specials, it's a win-win!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think it since it's just a little hole in the wall but most people come here because of the legends they hear about the burgers, if you work in the area, your in luck with only $6 lunch specials!!!

Whether you get the Patty Melt or the Garlic burger, these are well worth the $6 that you spend. Good atmosphere, you may sit next to the manager or salesperson that just sold you that GT350 Shelby or that BMW M2 since it is located at Camelback and 12th st in the middle of the Camelback Difference Dealer Alley! 

Highly recommended to stop in and say Hi to the good ole folks at Harvey's WineBurger! Don't come in a hurry because the food is cooked fresh when you order it and you will be a bit slower on your way out the door.

Happy eatin!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is amazingly friendly. Burgers are terrific, beer is cold and I could definitely see my self coming back."}
{"text":"Top 5 burger In Phoenix for the price. I always get the patty melt, best I have ever had. Been going here for years the environment inside sometimes unnecessarily loud from the jukebox. Burger is always on point though and will satisfy your burger fix."}
{"text":"I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.

Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.

They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.

They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.

If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one."}
{"text":"After a late night concert... we were hungry and wondering where we should go for drinks and food. 
We've been here for day drinking and it's amazing..... but never did the late night. 
Well we were so pleased to be served by Mark and of course had the best burgers in town!! 
We'll be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"The burgers here were great. Much like a burger that you would cook at a BBQ. Thick and juicy. Its an old run down bar, limited amount of seating and tables are pretty close together. It was clean inside but had that old bar feel. The service is not terrible but it wasnt the best either. One of the burgers was undercooked which the cook happily no questions asked cooked another one for us. Kudos to the cook. 
The fries were good and went amazing with the burger. It was priced decently as well. You would spend just as much if you went to Jack In The Box but you would get a fresher and better burger. 
I could only eat half the burger and I was full. The meat was great, nothing bad to say there. Its not a must to stop in, but if your a stickler for a thick juicy burger, this may fill that void!"}
{"text":"Harvey's is the original Wineburger, located on 16th Street in Phoenix since 1954. The wineburgers are as great as ever- top quality!"}
{"text":"Fun place and really good burgers"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, good bartenders, friendly&welcoming atmosphere! I did not try the food but the burgers looked so delicious  I will definitely be back for one. They have music and pool tables also so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great spot to have a burger, this is definitely a great place to go. For the price I paid, I was amazed on how good the burger was for the price I paid - and it was homemade! You can tell the meat was never frozen. You can tell they made it the way your dad would! 

A cool looking dive bar, be sure to be prepared for that if you weren't already. I would give this place 5 stars except that the clientele is not ideal. I love the food, but probably would not go back as I don't feel the most comfortable. I suppose that's what a dive bar is, but I feel they could do more to attract different crowds."}
{"text":"This place is classic Burger Heaven!!! Know that there are no salads or healthy food- this is bar food at its very best! The establishment is clean and the staff is beyond friendly. We always feel welcome here with our service dog Little Sushi. They care about customers and customer service. 

The food! Best burger in town! They have fried jalapeños and they are addictive. My husband and I always get the super deluxe burger and it's not only tasty it's affordable- always a bonus! The bar is fully stocked and offers a great many choices to keep you hydrated ;) 

This is a phoenix staple - it's historic but not only that - they are a great establishment with amazing food and service that deserves recognition 100% if you love burgers you need to have this place in your life. :)"}
{"text":"A little bit of a wait but the burger I got here. However it was fantastic. Although more than anything I was blown away by the onionrings! :D"}
{"text":"This place is simply the best at what it does. Try the pudding shots they are fantastic the burgers the wings the chicken tenders and don't forget the mixed basket of onion rings and french fries ask for mayo and ranch on the side"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a dive bar with a really good burger and probably some of the best onion rings in the valley... this is the place to visit. Can't give it 5 stars because the bathrooms are absolutely repulsive, even for a dive bar."}
{"text":"Excellent dive bar with a sincere attention to detail and quality. Wine burgers done right. Cocktails excellently blended. Salads extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Went there to pass time until our next stop. Harvey's has been a valley staple since I was a little girl.  The new owners are nice and have freshened up the interior.  Had I known how delicious the Wineburgers were before, I would have visited this place much sooner!  They grill then fry their hot wings-delicious.  Patrons include suit and ties from the local business community and flip flops and tshirts from everywhere coming for the Wineburger.   Service is always very attentive. They have pool tables, dart boards, a dining area, and plenty of TVs. The  bathrooms have been upgraded (thanks for the purse hook!!), but it's hot in there. $2 PBRs and the grill is open until 1:30 a.m.!"}
{"text":"I am a dive bar expert.  I love me a good dive bar.  The darker and older the better.  The surly regulars on the fringes of society are my people.

This place is shit.  Not 'The Shit'.  Actual shit, as in a piece of crap.

We ordered wings, after the bartender bragged how they were the best in town, and the regulars started laughing about how they just cooked a bunch of fish they caught locally in the frier, and that our wings were gonna taste fishy.  Not in a \"we're fuckin' with you\" way, but more of a \"we have no sense of self\" way.

Homo say what!?!?

They did taste fishy!  We each ate only one.  Everyone was having a great time about it.  We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.  

We finished our beers and left.

Even if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.  Bigger isn't better in the case of wings.  They aren't actually buffalo wings, and shouldnt resemble some bloated and abused fictional beast.  They should be from chickens.  SMALL CREATURES CALLED CHICKENS.


The end."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've been in this place and it hasn't changed in the last few years.  This place is a bit on the scummy side but the burgers are good.   I'm sure there are better places to go but the prices are fair and the service is always friendly.   

I'm a fan but it will be another few years until I'm back again."}
{"text":"This place is dirty.  Food is awful, transients hang out here, music is Loud & noisy. When we were going here there was a couple making out on the outside of a building. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Ok, first time I was here was for lunch. I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had. Noticed the pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place. 

two days later, for dinner and drinks, 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night. She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.

I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week. (joking.... kinda)"}
{"text":"Just to be weird, I have only gone here for lunch. With Groupons.

All I can say is that a) the burgers are good b) it's so blatantly anti-yuppie that its actually appealing, and c) I need a leisure suit and a mid-70's Dodge to do this place right."}
{"text":"About two years ago I was out here for work and I stop in here maybe by change maybe because I saw a Yelp review, but we can go for the second.  This is a total dive bar.  They have these small pitchers for when you want two beer but dont want to come back up so often.  But even better than the food and drinks, they have Duck pin bowling.  It is like a small single lane bowling alley right in the bar and it is the great bar game ever.  I was staying 45 minutes away in North Scottsdale last time I was in town and drove here just for a beer a couple quick games.  It sounds odd, but so much fun."}
{"text":"This place has the best service ever!!! They can be packed with only two employees working and still have your drinks full at all times. They also have cheap shots and always have drink specials. They really care about their customers and always provide exceptional service. Their food is soooo good too! They are by far the best bar in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Before choosing to come to Harvey's Wineburger tonight I read all 82 previous reviews and was totally confused. While many were positive, way too many were so negative that I almost decided not to go. It was only after reading them in order from oldest to newest that I could see what was happening. In a nutshell at one time Harvey's Wineburger was a great little bar with excellent cheap food. Then the owner died and the place went down the toilet (kind of literally), then someone else bought it and it got a little better and then it was recently sold again. So do  yourself a favor and save the time I spent by ignoring all reviews (positive and negative) from before 2014 and only read the one's that apply to the place AS IT IS TODAY because whatever used to be before now is meaningless to you, the former restaurant is gone, it's in the past and should just be forgotten.

We walked in and looked around and discovered that yes it looks like something from the set of \"Cheers\". Bravo! I will never understand people who choose to go to a classic dive knowing that it's a classic dive, decide to stay and eat/drink, then go home and write a 1-star review because it was a classic dive. When they drove up in their Bentley and walked in with their snooty Beverly Hills attitude they weren't smart enough to figure out based on the neighborhood and look of the building that this is an old neighborhood dive bar? And they're so proud of their ignorance that they proclaim it publically in a review?  Wow!

So, personally, I loved the \"look\" or lack of it. The place is divided into 3 sections, a dining area to the right (with a pot belly stove) which is separated by a half-wall from a long western-style bar, which is separated by a full wall from the noisier and more boisterous pool tables and other gaming gear.

There was a group of about a dozen customers at the bar who had been drinking and were loud and another dozen or so at the pool tables who we couldn't hear because of the solid wall. I'm sure this would have outraged Mr & Mrs Bentley from Beverly Hills - to think of it! The nerve of those people drinking and making noise in a bar!!!

We seated ourselves and a really friendly young bartender immediately came over to greet us. We decided to get into the spirit of the place and have $2 PBR's in tall cans and to try the original Harvey Wineburger with the $2 add-on side of onion rings and fries. As we waited we noticed the 3 brand-new 70\" TV's on the wall and that the speaker in the dining room was playing some loud music. Not annoyingly loud ... bar loud. I can just hear Mr & Mrs Bentley freaking out that a bar was playing music instead of serenading them with a strolling violinist.

We didn't have to notice the TV's for long because the burgers were brought to us in less than 15 minutes. Yes, I know, the string of McDonald's franchises Mr & Mrs Bentley own serves their burgers in less than 5 minutes. How RUDE to make a customer wait 15 minutes for a burger that's hand-formed and actually cooked instead of microwaved.

Both the bartender and a waitress came over numerous times to ask how we were doing. Both of them extremely nice and friendly. The customers at the bar were also pleasant, not at all like some people have described them. Oh, and as more people arrived to eat, the management was courteous enough to shut the music off in the dining room and leave it on only in the game room.

So, bottom line, how was the food? Well, there are a few things that are consistent in my reviews. One is that I love a real hamburger made by real people in a mom & pop dive. Two is that I don't believe it is possible to call any restaurant's food the best as in \"best hamburger\" or \"best pizza\" or anything like that. The variety and differences you find at local mom & pops are what make exploring and experimenting fun. That being said, Harvey's Wineburger ranks as one of the best burgers I've tasted anywhere. Adding the wine gives it a truly unique flavor. The condiments are simple and you add them yourself ... ketchup, mustard, onion, lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayonnaise. The burger patty is obviously hand-formed, thick and cooked perfectly well-done. The bun is nothing special, which is good because it doesn't take away from the flavor of the meat.

Now, compare that to the \"best burger\" lists you see in newspapers and on the internet. They are always accompanied by photos of a 3' high burger with crap on it that no one can even pronounce that no mouth ever made could wrap around it, and priced at $25 for a freakin' burger. Not for me! I like my burgers honest and Harvey's Wineburger serves one of the most honest there is.

So, when you add it all up it's 5-stars for the quality of the food, the friendliness of the service, the promptness, the value, the honest hominess ... everything works unless, that is, you go in with a Beverly Hills attitude. In that case you'll hate it."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers come here once in a while. Wings took 30 minutes and I feel like they trying to kicks us out. I don't want my check I want another corona and keep watching the Superbowl."}
{"text":"Been here before. Was good. During middle of day. Told my wyfe \"you gotta try this place\" its yummy. Took her for dinner. Her cheeseburger was over cooked and dry. My wings were charred and dry. Wait staff asked how it was and i told her \"overcooked\". She said sorry can i make u more? I said NO cant stomach anymore of their food. So what do i get in return? A FULL BILL!!! $30..... At least the wyfe learned a new drink. Wont be back here, which sucks cause they are stumbling distance from home"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by here after years of driving by it. The reason for the stop was we were looking for a place to throw darts and grab a bite to eat so this popped up as an option. First thing I want to highlight is the dart board. It looks brand new and works like a champ. Best one I've thrown at in awhile. Second, the happy hour doesn't sound great (50 cents off), but because the drinks are already so cheap it's a great deal. As for food we ordered a cheeseburger + green chili. The burger was juicy and good. The chili was canned chili and mild so nothing special. We also tried the sampler platter. The chicken strips were actually really good, the jalapeño bottle caps were salty, and the mozzarella sticks were pretty straight forward. We enjoyed our visit and will be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and both times have had a good experience! The guy who we ordered food from was friendly, kind, and prompt. I think he could tell we were newbies, in fact, i'm sure he could tell. We ordered drinks, and then later ordered burgers and a side of onion rings to share. The onion rings were super delicious (i may be biased though because they are my favorite fried food!) and the Burgers were pretty darn good too for a dive bar. I think everyone should at least give them a chance if you like divey bars, good drinks, and yum-bar eats."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate definition of a bar.
1. PBR beer
2. Two pool tables
3. A dart board and darts
4. Great simple food--nothing fancy
5. Beer on tap--only a couple of choices, keep it simple
6. Friendly bar people serving you
7. Loud music
8. Big screen TVs and a couple of different channels-- not too many
9. People having fun
10. A 10% off deal for Yelpers
The food here was very tasty and we all were pleasantly surprised at the value (and we won at pool).
One more time--this is a real bar. Enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite burger places in the valley.  Read the other reviews because they're mostly all correct....this place is a total dive bar but they serve amazing burgers.

Note to the owners:  as of this date (1/15/17) the standard menu portion of your website isn't working; all you can see is the specials menu."}
{"text":"My first time there since moving here in 1979. Very good patty melt and fries, reasonably priced, but atrocious service. Can't see myself returning when so many other great burger joins in north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, great happy hours, great shooters... Pool and darts. One of my favorite spots"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice, but we waited forever for mediocre food. There were maybe 12 people in the place, by no means busy, and it took 45 minutes to get our food. After half an hour, our waitress offered us fries and apologized saying the food was \"taking longer than normal\". Once we got our burgers, we were underwhelmed. My burger was served on a cheap bun and my gal's patty was falling apart. We took our food to go and left. Maybe 10 minutes after we finished our food at home, my girlfriend was sick. Probably caught them on a bad day, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you want oh so gooey good!  I am so happy I had the spice burger with onion rings!  We had great service and awesome food. Music a little louder then I like but, it's a bar. I haven't been here in at least 40 years, why?  I will be back again."}
{"text":"I really want to love this spot. But nothing truly shines here.

First, having \"wine\" in the name is misleading. If you're a wine enthusiast, they dont have a wine list for you, and the only wine being used is pretty much a splash of wine vinegar on the patty while its on the grill. 

On to the burger, the valley is full of fantastic burgers. Burgers that are simple, delicious, affordable bites, all the way to decadant, creative, thoughtfully sourced, pricey experiences. And this one isnt anywhere near the top. 

The beer list is simple, nothing really adventurous, but thats fine for a dive. Because Harvey's is a dive, and that is actually what it's best at. 
It's a no frills, simple, open late & have yourself a drink & a bite kind of place. 
Maybe it's my fault for wanting more."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Hip hop dive bar that's just an average dive bar and serves average food. Mark learned my name and that was cool..

I have yet to experience the perfect meal and I've eaten here many times. I really do not like the musical selections but if you're into hip- hop, you'll enjoy.

Meal 1: onion rings and wine burger ordered medium. It was a perfectly cooked burger and she remembered I asked for no tomatoes. The onion rings were not to my liking and kinda bland and heavy although she did fry them well to ensure they were very crispy.

Meal 2:chicken wings extra crispy and fries cooked exactly right on the wings. Only a few were soggy toward the end. Not the best attempt at crispy wings I've been served, but it was up there. However something was inedible. The fries were crispy but terribly over seasoned and I couldn't eat them.

Meal#3: Leo is now the cook. My burger was over cooked (completely cooked through-not medium) but the bacon was crispy and the fries seasoned perfectly. Leo did not remember \"no tomato\". He made a lot if errors in the kitchen while I was there.

Also I saw how they handle when an order is made incorrectly... they scrape off the incorrect ingredient and serve it anyway. Wrong table served... just e-serve. Ugh. I hate when restaurants are lazy and don't own up to mistakes and explain why an order was re-cooked. If I didn't like onions, I would find the hint if them repulsive in a re-served burger.

Meal 4 and final meal: again ordered burger medium with fries. I told Leo that last time my burger was over cooked and I wanted it medium no tomato. When he served it with tomato he took it back, removed the tomato and served me the same lettuce, onion, pickle. The burger was way well done. The fries were undercooked and starchy. Terrible meal. I mentioned this to Leo and he said said something to the effect that it wasn't like that when he pulled it off the grill? WTF? 

Prices are cheaper than most sports bars for a burger and fries, but I want it cooked right and am willing to pay more for that.

You can't cook and I'm out. Don't make excuses, make it right somehow. It's inappropriate to have BURGER in your name and not be able to cook one."}
{"text":"A Chill local bar a staple in the area for those who enjoy a good burger it's one of your best options in Phoenix. It's a family-friendly and despite an earlier reviewer Asian friendly Bar and Grill the customers are cool except a some crochety old guy that comes in on the weekend(mornings)in a red truck but a great atmosphere and the new owner Vinny is on top of things he's kind of a hunk too LOL"}
{"text":"Mark, April, and Patti made my night wonderful after a day of working. I feel so free! Great drinks, great prices, and really great food!"}
{"text":"Was totally surprise last Friday night to go to Harvey's and find out that their Wings which were 10 for $7 are now 6 for $7.  Was a good local place but really $14 for a dozen wings, too many places in a mile radius with atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a super cute dive bar..... The decor is fabulous and I was excited to eat here. The husband and I started by ordering drinks..... Unfortunately, my drink never came.... And the service was so spotty, it became irrelevant by the time I could have asked for it. The husband got a wine cheeseburger and I got their version of a patty melt with bacon and parm sauce.... My burger was pretty not awesome. The bottom piece of bread was soggy with grease. The bacon was thin. The cheese didn't taste like cheese..... Tasted processed. Overall, the burger was super disappointing and left a slick of grease in my mouth. The fries, however, were awesome. Perfectly fried and crispy. The husband's burger was better than mine. It was a pretty standard burger. I feel like there are better places to get burgers in the valley that cost the same or less."}
{"text":"Dive bar or not, this is a business. And it seems like it is run like a JOKE. 

I call and place an order to pick up, Christine says it would be 30 minutes to which I agree and place my order. Zach gets there to pick it up and ends up waiting until it's been ONE HOUR later. 

Christine knowing he's there waiting for a pick up order pays no mind and finally comes back and says they NEVER MADE IT. All the while he's been watching the cook hanging out and serving beers, wondering what the hell is going on?! Do you have to be a regular to get service? Great business model. 

He's pissed at this point and says cancel it and he's leaving. He comes home and tells me everything and I decide to call to make sure he wasn't charged. 

Call and Christine hangs up on me. 

I call back and Christine this time says she couldn't hear me before, that she's brand new and didn't know what happened to the order and offers to get the owner.

I get on the phone with the [owner Vincent] he says he is and this guy sounds like he doesn't even care. He tells me that when we called and placed the order, there were 20 people in there and when Zach came to pick up they had 70 people in there and \"TO-GO orders take the back burner when its busy\". 

It was NOT busy when he walked in AND they could have TOLD him that!!! COMMUNICATE. Zach saw the cook serving beers and hanging out. Wtf?! 

[Vincent] offers to recook the food and comp my meal because I'm pissed at this point, but I don't want it. I just wanted to let this guy know how his business is being run and he gets all \"what do you want me to do about it? Don't yell at me like I'm a child.\" Come on. Don't lie to me like I'm a child. 

It is so annoying to experience how apathetic and unprofessional some small business owners can be."}
{"text":"I love this place.
Its a great, chill place to go. All the bartenders are super friendly and I never have to wait to get a drink, shot or food. Not only is the staff friendly, but so are all the customers.
The wineburgers are delicious and the baskets of onions rings and fries are huge, definitely share with someone!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are absolutley wonderful! My co-worker and I picked lunch up from here during our break at work, it took a while to be prepared(I wouldn't suggest if you are in a rush) but was totally worth it! I had multiple people in my office asking where we went for lunch. Needless to say this might a dealership favorite soon.

They also have deals eveyday of the week for food and drinks. Tuesday is $6 Cheesewineburger and fries."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! Hands down! If you want the best burger of your life go to Harveys! The burger is juicy, full of flavor, and charbroiled. OMG!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for many years in the Phoenix area. Interesting take on burgers. Tasty and juicy. A divey atmosphere but that is part of this places charm"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a million times and honestly never thought about stopping by. My buddy and were at another bar drinking, but we started to get hungry. The joint we were at did not have food so we decided to look for a bar with food and found this place.

The place was pretty packed but we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartenders were great, really friendly. The only thing that kinda sucked was the wait time for our burgers. I totally get they were busy, but I was definitely getting a little hangry. 

The burger itself was was delicious and cooked just the way I like it. I will definitely be coming here again in the near future. I'm not a fan of larger crowds, so I'll try to avoid a Friday night."}
{"text":"Came in the other night with a group of friends, knowing the name of this place I knew I was going to enjoy my burger! 

(Super Deluxe)"}
{"text":"What a great local dive bar. First time in we got a 20 ounce kiltlifter, vodka soda, and giant order of fries for seven bucks. So awesome. 

The burgers are legitimately good. Expect fried greasy goodness. This is definitely a bar style burger but all that grease will adequately lube up your face hole for $2pbr and cheap chicken wings. There are TVs to watch games and there are two surprisingly level pool tables. 

If you want frills or mixologists this isn't your place. If you want cheap beer and delicious clogged arteries served by a bartender who will serve you complimentary cement mixer shots as punishment (congratulations?) when your team beats hers this is your spot."}
{"text":"Money. That's the word I would use to describe this joint. A definite hole in wall with zero windows it's almost too dark to see your food. I had the deluxe burger with mushrooms and it lived up to the hype. Absolutely amazing burger. Only knock on this place for me is their fries are not that good. Go with the onion rings."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Quick service, very friendly, burger and fries tasty!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stoped in for a beer and a wine burger. Im pretty hard to please and let me just say...I was impressed. Burger was good, staff was friendly, chili cheese fries were phenomenal!! Pin ball machine and bowling machine a little rough but who cares! I wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"On the up side, The Burger and fries were pretty good. The happy hour well drink had a lot to be desired,  guess that's why the call it well drink , right. For me over 40 bucks for  2 burgers, fries. A well drink and a pitcher of beer a bit pricy for happy hour."}
{"text":"BURGERS. Prob the one food item I'd want with me if I were on a deserted island. My heart lies with the Apple Pan burger in LA, but this place is def a top 5 winner.

Don't bother sitting at a table, its kinda awkward. Just post up on the bar and enjoy what's about to come. I eat my burgers plain. Just cheese, meat, and bun. Call me crazy, but when you add all those condiments it just takes away from the flavor of what you're actually going for. Now an In & Out burger on the other hand...bring all that goodness. Anyways, back to Harvey's. Go with the regular cheeseburger, the \"super\" (really just two patties stuck together) doesn't grab the wine as well and loses it's unique flavor. Keep an eye on the cook, it's pretty interesting the amount of wine (pretty sure it's burgundy) actually poured onto the grill and repeatedly on the burger, and one last douse before it's swept up off the grill. The taste...amazing. Melts in your mouth and with such a distinct flavor...you'll be back. Super juicy and oh so gooey with cheese. I think I saw a \"special\" seasoning in the back (aka looked like \"Lawry's Seasoned Salt\") but maybe not. Guess we'll never know.

I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because, one it's not the best I've had, and two their fries suck. Onion rings are a better option.They need to step up their fry game immediately  if they want to hang with the best of them. But other than that I can't complain. Tried the chili cheese fries, which I'm not a big fan of anyway, and wasn't impressed. LA's Carney's on Sunset prob wins that award.

And so you know...it's a hole in the wall. Not that that's bad, but don't be expecting a restaurant. We had quite the interesting conversations with others sitting at the bar. Pretty intense, but you can prob get away with keeping your eyes on your food and your company. Classic Bud Light neons all around, juke box, super dark, old school video games...yup that kind of spot. Again...no big prob with it.

All in all, I give Harvey's top billing for making a unique cheeseburger and one that I consider to be one of the best I've ever had. It's 110% worth trying to give yourself something to consider next time you're dreaming about meat, cheese, and buns...Oh wait...is that only me???"}
