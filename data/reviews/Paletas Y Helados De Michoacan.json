{"text":"Let me start by saying the owner is the nicest guy on earth! He is extremely helpful and will not let you buy anything before you try it. The yogurt is amazing, the homemade horchata is to die for! And just the overall service is amazing. I will always come to this place."}
{"text":"Really nice workers, really good Mexican snacks!! It's a new place & the inside is really clean & good environment"}
{"text":"The north needed a place like this. It's generally quite and well kept. Clean and the service is great! Just try it for yourself it's a must! I wish they served Elotes that would be soooooo bomb!"}
{"text":"Saw this new Spanish style dessert eatery near my neighborhood and I went for a visit. They have a huge billboard of desserts on their wall with pictures of the different kinds of goodies they offer.  It all ranged from ice cream, drinks and snacks. The employees were very helpful because the majority of the menu are in Spanish names and I did not know any of them.  They offered some suggestions of what I was craving for and also recommendations of their most popular items.  I ordered an elote. I have not had one in a while. It came in a foam box with a corn on a stick. Spread with mayonnaise, cayenne powder, chile powder and topped it off with cheese. I absolutely loved every bite of it.  My friend ordered a watermelon popsicle from there also and he enjoyed that.  The prices were cheap and reasonable. The inside of this store was clean to my standards.  I would come back to try out more goods they offer."}
