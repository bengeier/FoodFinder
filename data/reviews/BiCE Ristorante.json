{"text":"Wife's part Italian. Been to Italy numerous times. Knew it was expensive and expected food to be equal.  Wasn't.  Ordinary food at extraordinary prices.  Good veal osso bucco (special. $48, w/ no mention of price and I was too stupid to ask before ordering) on a great risotto, but that was as good as it got.  Greasy Calamari ($16) could have (and may have) come pre-breaded straight out of a bag (marinara sauce, however, was very good).  Radiccio salad w/ anchovy dressing tasted not at all of anchovy.  Carpaccio on arugula salad was fatty & tasted of truffle oil...at $18 for an appetizer, I expected more.  Scallops came 4-on a plate for $33 (nicely done, but very lonely). House special tortelloni stuffed w/ lobster was pasty, gummy w/ house-made pasta nearly raw...and darned if we could find any lobster...sent it back and was taken off bill.  No explanation, no apology,although they offered to get something else.  Oleaginous service was inept for a fancy place (plates removed while others were still eating, etc.)  Dashing around with accents does not a quality Italian restaurant make.  Same chain tried in 90's in Scottsdale and failed.  Same will probably happen again here."}
{"text":"This is our favorite dining spot in all of Scottsdale. The staff makes you feel welcome, like an Italian home. There are a variety of seating options to enjoy - the scenic lounge on the second floor is a must see and the downstairs with its beautiful decor. The food is bar none - fabulous. Try happy hour to sample the menu."}
{"text":"We went to Bice to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary.   Our waiter Mauricio, made some wonderful suggestions and our dinner was delicious. Mauricio also brought us out a celebratory dessert which was amazing.  The restaurant is beautiful, the staff professional and friendly & the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Way too pricey even for North Scottsdale.  Said they were closing for the summer but never reopened.  Space was formerly occupied by Michael's at the Citadel, and come March a new steakhouse will give it a try . . . Preston's.  Methinks the hard-to-see location is deadly for restaurant ventures."}
{"text":"I have been to Bice in NY & Chicago and had very positive experiences. I can't say the same for their restaurant in Scottsdale. The worst service I have ever had in a pricey restaurant.  It would not be tolerated at Denny's, let alone a restaurant with these price points. We had to ask for bread, well after our drinks and salad were served. The waiter was disinterested and all about himself. But the reason we will not return is a bait and switch on the wine. They said they were out of our first choice, but would give a more expensive wine for the same price. When the bill came, we fortunately double checked it, but guess what? We were charged the higher price. The restaurant was not busy and this \"error\" is inexcusable in a first class restaurant. Also you are sort of forced to pay for valet parking in an empty office block parking lot. In any event, if you want to try Bice in North Scottsdale, go soon. I doubt they will survive until next season. PS. The food was just fair and overpriced."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful the staff is courteous and friendly. The wine menu is bar none, the food is delicious and it melts in your mouth. The desert was an aphrodisiac,what more could anyone ask for?"}
{"text":"I will admit that I have not yet experienced the full dining service but I been there numerous times for happy hour.  Their establishment is tastefully designed, the atmosphere is inviting, and the staff I always very nice.  The upper portion of the restaurant shares the same great staff, with an indoor/outdoor feel.  Leonardo is an amazing Maître d'.  Great place."}
{"text":"Table for two on valentines day was right on top of  another table for two. You could not say anything because they could hear everything. Noting romantic about that. I asked for another table and they said no. We where forced to engage in conversation with both parties next to us. That's not how I planned our valentines dinner. We had gifts to give each other just chocolates and cards and everyone close buy was looking. Our table was right next to the fireplace and it was very hot. 59.00 fixed price per person, for a fixed menu. Fillet tasted like a cheap piece of roast beef. We did not like the appetizer brochettes. No other option. 
The waitress did not know how to open the wine. I had to help here. She said she just learned how the night before. But she was very nice and pleasant. I gave here a nice tip. 
Desert was good. This was our third time at Bice. Never again."}
{"text":"We went back to Bice last night and we could not be more impressed. The special pasta was butternut squash stuffed ravioli in sage butter. I can now die a happy man. Chris, our server (ask for him, he is good at what he does), suggested we try it. I did not listen to him but the wife did. Big mistake. The lasagna was great but the ravioli was truly spectacular!  The bread basket is so big and delicious there is no need to get an appetizer. We will be back, we will ask for Chris and we will take his suggestions. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Lets be honest and put it simply.........absolutely would not go back!  Overpriced and food very average or below.  Very disappointing!!!   Bread was fine, but, bread is bread.  I give this place less than one year!!"}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with our experience. The food was below average. The fava bean salad had no flavor or seasoning and the shrimp pasta was fishy tasting and the shrimp was overcooked."}
{"text":"We went for a drink and desert in the upstairs lounge after eating elsewhere. Nice lounge area with fires to sit around outside. I hope they make it but this place is huge and the dinner menu looked pricey. Ordered almond and chocolate cake which turned out to be more like 2 small, square, very average brownies with a tiny scoop of gelato which was blah. For $11 expected more. Husband paid $7 for bottled beer.  They had music upstairs, but it was a five piece band and was very loud for the space. Bartender was very friendly, but with several good Italian places near by (like Pane Vino) I won't return soon. Again - hope they make it but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This was our second dinner at BiCE and once again the food was delicious and the friendly staff made our evening an experience!!! We had a large group and everyone that had the Lamb raved that it was the best they've had. I had steak which was perfect. Cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Experience! Service was great, food was amazing. We had the special tortellini and  Mahi Mahi. It was cooked perfect!  Desserts were great we had the tiramisu, creamery brûlée , and panne cote.  The chef and maitre d both from Milan were very helpful and went out of there way to make our night great. Well definitely be back for dinner and the happy hour!!! The place to be!!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling generous so I'm going to round up from 3.5 stars.

We didn't have reservations and I didn't love being seated in the cheese bar.  With the fireplace and wood oven it was a little warm.

Also not loving the \"buona sera\" and good evening greetings.  Redundant and a little phony.

That being said the food was excellent.  Really nice bread selection and my seafood risotto was outstanding."}
{"text":"We went to this place on Saturday night for dinner with my sister and brother-in-law.  Glad I didn't pick it because it was not good at all.  The owner was a very cute guy from Milan and the place itself is very nice.  That's as far as my compliments can go!  Our waiter was very scattered and couldn't answer a question about one of the sauces.  I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the special, which was lobster ravioli.  When it finally arrived, my soup was very disappointing.  Not a shred or bit of lobster in the soup!  The taste was quite good, but to me it should have at least a few bits of lobster!   My ravioli was not very hot and there were a total of 4 very small ravioli's.  Nothing else was served with this except for the table bread.  I am not a big eater and so I was happy at least for the bread.  My husband ordered another special and his portion was small as well.  Even the pasta was skimpy!  Also, be sure to ask the prices for the specials.  They were very pricey for what you got!   We went upstairs to the bar for dessert and an after dinner drink.  Our waiter forgot about us and it was quite awhile before he remembered that we had gone upstairs...  I will say that the tiramisu was very good.  However, my Amaretto was served without ice and I'm not sure I even got a \"shot\".  On top of that we were overcharged on our bill for it.  Won't be going back again!"}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed in my life, my friends took me here for my Birthday and I had the Lasagna, I think I wouldve been better off going to Walgreens to grab a Stouffers, the staff is pretentious, rude...I would never in a million years spend a dime in this dump. Save your time and money, it sucks"}
{"text":"We were invited to come to a Wine tasting here by some friends.  Located in the Pinnacle Peak area of Scottsdale, we don't come by here very often.  We arrived and were guided upstairs by the hostess.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that there was a 2nd level with an outdoor patio...very cool.

The Wine tasting was setup in a large room that felt like a living room.  It had a fireplace and a bunch of sofas & chairs....a very comfortable setting.  We tasted a variety of Italian Wines...2 White (Pinot Grigio & sparkling Wine) and 2 Red (blends).  The hostess conducting the tasting was very friendly and informative....however, there were too many people and she got slammed, so it became a Wine pourfest....that's my issue with Wine tastings, it's always too crowded and you can never learn anything because everyone wants to just fill their glasses.

Appetizers were passed around for the tasting guests.  I was able to sample the Pizza, Bruschetta, and Calamari.  They were all very good.

After the Wine tasting was over, we weren't ready to go, so we ordered a bottle of Cabernet and sat outside around the fire and enjoyed the awesome weather and conversation.

The restaurant was pretty dead though.  If it wasn't for the Wine tasting which had 20-30 people attending, I think there would only be 10-15 people in the restaurant.

I wish we lived a little closer.  I'd like to come back again.  

Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night.    My wife, son, daughter-in-law and I enjoyed the warm service and excellent food.   

We will be back."}
{"text":"We did not end up staying because we were looking for something different but the host was very nice and courteous and best of all did not take it personal when we decided to leave. We will be back in a few months when the weather is nicer to sit outside and hope the rest of the staff is as nice as the host"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know why this place got a couple bad reviews. When my friend and I walked in the staff was so nice. Our server was funny and very helpful he made great suggestions and when we decided to sit at the cheese bar after already being seated at a table he had no problem moving us. We also got to meet the executive chef who is from italy and is so nice and very passionate about his food. So here's my rating on the food.

Cheese plates- great and the cheese expert gives you such a detailed explanation of every cheese

Focaccia and proscuitto- great the bread is crunchy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside and the proscuitto is like butter

Pasta- We had the king crab tortellini with tomato and basil and got very lucky that the chef was trying out something different so he gave us spinach and ricotta ravioli sauteed in butter and thyme which was my absolute favorite.

Pizza- we had the pizza bianca which also did not disappoint.

After all that we did have dessert because I have a terrible sweet tooth.

Tiramisu- perfect just the right amount of sweetness coffee and liqueur so creamy. A great end to the meal

So overall amazing the only thing I would warn people about is it doesn't come cheap so be prepared to drop quite a bit of money but I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We live in the area so decided to out the new BiCE, we have seen the \"opening soon\" sign for almost a year now and after researching it online where excited to try it.

The Pro's

* Very nice remodel to the old Michaels' place, looks nice, modern, and almost hip. 

* Food was pretty good, not as good as should be expected by this price point, but still good tasty dishes.

The Con's

* They did not have our reservation down, but luckily we got a table.

* The staff here needs some serious training if they expect to compete in the fine dining market here in Scottsdale. The bar tender is in way over his head for a upper end type bar. 

* Wine list needs help.

* The manager seems very ambitious, but to a point of being fake.

* The waiter, who was very hard to understand, seemed like he just got his first job as a waiter. He had a hard time answering questions and didn't seemed to have the experience we would assume should come with this type of place.

* Service seemed very slow all night, we sat there with our finished plates for 20 minutes before they noticed. 

* Dessert to another 20 minutes to get, and the check another 20 minutes............................................................................................................................................................................it just went on forever...........................


Overall we would not return, and we live right buy the place. Simply think it wont make it in this area unless they step it up. Too bad as the place itself looks great and could be a hip place."}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  Good food but make sure you ask prices of Specials.  They sock it to ya. Learned my lesson. Drinks overpriced as well."}
