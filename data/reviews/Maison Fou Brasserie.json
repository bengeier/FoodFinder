{"text":"Great ambience, great service, great menu. Happy, happy to have a decent restaurant in Bloor West!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and interior (I loved the mix of classic french style with modern wood elements!!!) Good wine selection and deserts. Hope they do well!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my Sunday brunch. My friend ordered the Egg Meurette and I had a cheese omelette. Everything was good. Even the side salad on my plate was exceptional. We liked the lovely decor and atmosphere and that our server spoke French. I just wish they took themselves more seriously.   The hostess was wearing yoga pants and the manager was in jeans and a hooded sweatshirt. He then degraded the restaurant experience by telling me that they're not really French. Such a shame they lack professional experience. Everything matters in a restaurant it's necessary to think of all perspectives."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. The food was overpriced and extremely mediocre - if you want to charge ~$15 for brunch, it has to be very good! My meal (mushrooms and egg on sourdough) looked like slop thrown together from cheap ingredients and was far from worth the price. The service was friendly at first - brought a colouring book and crayons for a friend's daughter which was wonderful - but after getting our food and half refilling our coffee (literally - ran out of coffee in the container she was pouring from and didn't bother coming back) we were ignored for the rest of our meal. We eventually had to go hunt down a staff member to get our cheque an hour later. Our server did apologize for having left us alone, claiming that it got too busy - but this wasn't the case until the last half hour of our stay.   Also worth noting that the brunch menu was very pared down as compared to that advertised on the website. Many of the very attractive options were gone - there were really only run of the mill brunch staples that you could get better versions of elsewhere for less.  Some may appreciate their very family friendly policies, which was great."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent drinks, excellent service, excellent ambiance. I am still dreaming about their pillowy crisp gnocchi and love their brunch. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Bloor West restaurants! We thoroughly enjoyed an amazing meal last night - from drinks (stellar manhattan and nice glass of french white) to mains (seabream and burger: flavours were amazing) to atmosphere (really nice, chill) to service (A-1) and very reasonably priced - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So good restaurant.  Food was delicious and made better by the impeccable service.  Couldn't have chosen a better perfect place to catchup with my besties."}
{"text":"Group of 4 for which we ordered 4 sharing appetizers.  Escargot, cheese plate, mixed meat plate and beef tartar.  All excellent!  For entree's I had the trout, nice and light, subtle glaze and no bones.  Two had steak and one the burger.  Guess what, all excellent.  Pricing was very fair, highest entree on the menu was $26.  We also shared a few deserts but I won't be repetitive with my comments...  Only critique and I'm only putting this to show some objectivity, espresso, pass on it... I wish I could remember the servers name, bit of an urban hipster but he had personality and had the right amount of attentiveness.  No doubt I'll be back despite living in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Elevated French food without the attitude. Had a really lovely and down to earth dining experience. The food was delicious, the service attentive, and the ambiance was warm.   -Crab creme (creamy accented by crunchy crab)  -Fingerings potatoes (sea salt, caviar, and clams)  -Seabream nicoise (perfectly cooked and looked too good to eat)  -Lamb shoulder (tender and had mint salad!)  -Warm pear pastry (beautiful contrast of warm pear and ice cream) -Cream brule (you can taste the pistachio and star anise!) -Wine (good selection, picked were recommended by the saff)   I would come back!"}
{"text":"Deliciously authentic French dishes with a twist. Morrocan spiced duck confit is fall off the bone and coq au vin are must-try as well as Escargot - so flavourful! Beautiful rustic decor with Parisian accents, very inviting and romantic. Friendly staff and Service."}
{"text":"The Duck Confit came with calabaza raisin purée, brussels sprouts, and cranberry bordelaise sauce. I did really enjoy this dish that we shared among the four of us. The duck was well done, seasoned pretty well, and the purée and sauce were great.  While the Duck Confit was great, the other dishes we tried were in need of much improvement."}
{"text":"Maison Fou is the best new thing about Bloor West Village. Finally a move away from pub snacks and greasy spoon, Maison Fou finally is bringing upscale French luxurious silky flavours for more than a reasonable price.   It's the perfect place to bring a date, go for after work snacks or hang out with your buddies and eat some amazing French cuisine!   Dishes of note:  The crab bisque with crab beignet is one of the most amazing things you will ever eat!  Gnocchi is fluffy and delicious!   Salted chocolate caramel mousse is something you can't leave without indulging in!   ----  Just having gone for the second time, I need to mention two more dishes that are a must!!!  Livers and onion are a fresh take on an underrated food! The batter on the livers alone will make you insane and beg for more!!  The duck confit is like no confit you've ever had before. The skin is crisp and amazing, the meat dissolves in your mouth and coats your tongue with French flavoured perfection.   This restaurant is truly my favorite new addiction in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This was a delicious meal. We had 13 in our party and all the meals were wonderful!! I had the burger and it was done as I asked. The chocolate mouse sent me over the edge - it was that good!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, and a classy atmosphere. I would recommend to any fine food lover for sure! Loved the steak tartare, coq au vin, beef cheeks, and bread pudding. Such a amazing meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's just barely okay. Like the last two restaurants in this location it's very overpriced for what you get. I don't know if this landlord charges too much or all three have been operated on the same lease by a crummy restaurant group. But there's a pattern and it stinks.  The service and atmosphere isn't good. Decor is fine, layout is cramped. Service is trying hard to be posh without the effortless grace you find in better places. Feels awkward and forced.  The food is alright. It would be good at half the price, the value proposition is terrible. Don't get the lamb."}
{"text":"Would give it a 3.5 if I could. Tried their duck confit, mussels jambalaya, and some sides. The duck confit was wonderful - crispy, tender, and flavourful. However everything else was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Came here recently for the second time and the verdict is in...Maison Fou is an average-at-best restaurant with nice decor and good service.  The big wrench in the mix here is that this is one the only pretenders in the \"grown up\" restaurant category in the neighbourhood. As Bloor West is full of families with 2-3 kids under 12 and retirees who have lived here for generations, the day-to-day demand for a classier restaurant, brew pub or cocktail bar is either not here or extremely pent-up due to other factors such as exorbitantly high rents. Some of the reviews may skew higher because there are neighbours who desperately want some place to go that is not a kid-zone or chain pub.  For my appetizer I had a gazpach-fou soup, which was a few shrimp, avocado pieces, and cucumber pieces floating in some sugary water. I cannot imagine how anyone creating the menu tasted that and thought it was something anyone would order twice.  For my main I opted for the burger (I had a reasonably good gnocchi on a previous visit.) The burger was a good size (and also cooked to temperature) and the fries were ok. The problem was that it was too salty. I had to fight the urge to go to Yogurty's Froyo afterward because of the extremely salty taste in my mouth.  In conclusion it will be difficult to return. While it is nice to have an adult-only space for dinner, there are better options on the west side of town for the money."}
{"text":"I reviewed Maison Fou several months ago when the wait staff and operations were struggling. I went back last night and what a difference! The staff were all fantastic. They recommended wines (and knew them!) - they even recommended a better value option to a bottle. They were attentive and helpful. The food remains fantastic - worth every cent for the duck confit and the foie gras and salads - a total turn around with what feels like staffing changes. Well done."}
{"text":"What a warm and inviting cafe/ bistro on  snowy evening. My young men (teenagers) thoroughly enjoyed their beefy choices. I tried the crispy chicken entre. Awesome! The wine and beer combos were a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere was terrific and comfortable as a visitor to Toronto from Texas!!!! Thank you. I will be back when we come back. K"}
{"text":"I was invited to brunch at Maison Fou Brasserie, and I was surprised because I'd never even heard of it. (I feel like I'm at the point in my life now where I recognize most Toronto restaurants by name.)  Anyway, I decided to order the Eggs Gaspé (\"crab cakes, poached eggs, bacon, beurre blanc, potatoes dauphinois\"). It's fine but completely unmemorable. First of all, the food arrived lukewarm. The crab cakes had clearly been prepared long before I received the plate. Far more problematic, though, was the disappointing blandness of the dish. There weren't any bold flavors to be found here, and after just a few bites, I was craving something different in terms of tastes.  Fortunately, we decided to order a dessert and this is where the restaurant shined. I got the Orange Rosemary Crème Brûlée and it was pretty fantastic. It contained the signature caramelized top one expects and the delectably creamy pudding held within was irresistible and quite flavorful. The orange rosemary separates this dish from any other variation I've had before, and I would gladly eat it again."}
{"text":"Great addition in my neighborhood! I went the first opening night with my wife, we were really excited to have a new restaurant close to home.  Food was excellent (tartare, croque madame, gnocchi, Brussel sprouts and a delicious absinthe crème brûlée!). Our server Zoe was really attentive and professional, we were her first guests so I hope we will bring her good luck!  Good luck to Maison Fou too and good job!"}
{"text":"Love it! So great to see a French bistro in Bloor West Village! Lovely service; very friendly & knowledgeable staff. They have family dinners every Sunday, and the food is delicious! For parents, 8 ounce wine glasses are the price of 5 ounces! There is a food menu for kids too!! Restaurant is about 4 months old and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Beautiful looking restaurant too."}
{"text":"Three of us had brunch today at Maison Fou.  Three different selctions - Mushrooms on Toast + Benedict + Pork Belly Confit - and all were delicious.  Plates were hot - always a nice touch.  Staff was excellent.  Only oddity was that we got the last portion of pork belly and it was only 12.30p on a Saturday and is also featured on the dinner menu.  Get there early if you want pork belly!!  Bistro chic atmosphere.  Interesting sound track.  Washroom decor must be from a previous incarnation as it does not match the current.  All in all a very nice experience.  Nice neighbourhood spot where you could pop in for a drink and snack at the bar.  Supposedly there's also a upstairs patio in nice weather."}
{"text":"Amazing burger.... You could tell the meat was fresh ground in the kitchen!!  We liked our brunch/lunch -- and the atmosphere! -- enough that we'll go back and try the dinner menu soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing refinement from a top notch chef, in the perfect neighborhood.  Came here with a bunch of friends and had a great lunch...tartar and beet salads and pretty much everything else was solid.  Great atmosphere and awesome wine bar upstairs!  Great way to start a nice bar hop / stroll in Bloor village. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Checked out Maison Fou with a group of local moms for drinks and snacks.  Our organizer was able to secure a private little nook upstairs with a table and seating for about 15.  Interesting wine list - I ended up choosing a few glasses of the gamay ($10.50) and split some frites ($7) and the large cheese plate ($28) with a few other ladies.    The frites were delish - perfectly fried and salty!  The cheese plate had a nice combo of hard/soft cheeses although I found the pieces super tiny for the price. The plate was a bit bare...I think they could have plumped it up a bit with more nuts, fruits and extra bread.    Others in the group ordered mushroom soup (looked yummy) and the steak frites (also appetizing).  Service was quite attentive and our waiter split bills without asking - good on him for handling our boisterous gaggle of ladies!  Nice place for drinks/snacks, might be tempted to come back to check out the rest of the menu next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience and attentive service. Liked the diversity of the staff.  The dinners were quite nice but the real gem was the chocolate mousse. My Aunt said it reminded her of her time in France. It was so silky and decadent.  I would have liked to see some more wines in the $50 range but there were some nice choices.   Definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Seriously tasty beef and they asked how we would like it cooked. Garlic aioli was heavy on the garlic, which is just how we like it and the fries were crispy and delicious. Being beef lovers, we also shared the Asian style steak tartare, also delicious and served with taro chips, made a nice change from the traditional version. Will be back!"}
{"text":"just went and had a really good meal. menu is a limited but really liked the starter salad, steak frites brussel sprouts, heirloom carrots.   not that impressed with the wine list.  all french which kind of makes sense  but would be nice to have some other options as french reds are not my favourite. some good beers on tap.    ambience was good and service was quick and friendly.  anyway glad it is in the hood and hope it stays around."}
{"text":"Huge improvement. What a delight.  I tried this place when it first opened a year ago and found it stuffy and overpriced. It wasn't the cozy neighbourhood brasserie I was dreaming of.  I just went back a few days ago and it was like a brand new restaurant. The menu was more exciting. The service was warm and friendly. The food was great and very reasonable priced for the quality.  The steak tartare appetizer was delicious and the wine list was both interesting and accessible.  I am thrilled with all of the changes and will definitely be a regular going forward."}
{"text":"This is a very nice little brasserie in an area which is saturated with pubs. Went here with my husband for a date night.   The décor is rustic bistro with distressed brick walls and varnished particle board walls in the basement washrooms) A shiny silver tin ceiling could use some toning down (either with pain or antiquing).   The menu features many french bistro classics with a couple of vietnamese fusion dishes thrown in. The only thing I considered missing from the menu was french onion soup.   We shared a charcuterie platter to start which featured 5 house made terrines and pates along with cornichons, quick pickles and mustard. All very nice. Duck, pork and chicken livers were all represented.   My husband had steak frites. Steak was perfectly executed and topped with butter. Fries were as expected. I had the sea bream with fingerling potatoes and olive tapenade. Fish had a lovely crisp skin and was placed atop a bed of roasted tomatoes, fingerling potatoes and kalamata olives (I would not have called it a tapenade). It was very tasty and the presentation was lovely.   Service was attentive and friendly.   We had a few glasses of wine and ended with a Sauternes. All told the bill was $150 which seemed reasonable.   In sum, this is a solid restaurant for french bistro food with a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Easiest 5 star rating I have ever* given.  If I could rate Maison Fou 6 stars, I would.  I've even debated going back to change all my other 5 star ratings to 4 stars.  We had the beef tartare and spicy frog legs to start. Both dishes were well plated and tasted as great as they looked.    For the main dishes, we ordered the duck confit and the seared lake trout.  The trout was good but the duck confit was the star of the show. This dish does not disappoint.   We finished with the the chocolate mousse and the poached pear tart. The chocolate mousse was rich and creamy and the poached pear tart is well worth the wait as the pastry is prepared in house upon order.  Looking forward to returning for buck a shuck oysters on Friday night VERY soon."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  Once for brunch and once for dinner.  I actually am surprised this place is not busier because the food is awesome.  It is a hidden gem for this area.  The other night I order the steak frite and no lie it was better than any I had in Paris a couple of weeks ago.  I also wanted iced tea and the waitress said they didn't have it but she would try making it for me.  I'm so happy she did because it was great and such a sweet gesture.    Their coffee is also very good and I look forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"A nice ambience and a warm service. Wasn't a fan of the oyster appetizer. The beef tartar was seasoned nicely The braised beef was perfectly cooked The duck was good too The organs creme brûlée was great   Overall a good experience"}
