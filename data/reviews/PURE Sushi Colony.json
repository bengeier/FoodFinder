{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have never been disappointed. Even had a birthday celebration here and the service was top notch. I am a huge sushi fan and they have a good selection!"}
{"text":"We have been in twice now and both times were really nice.  The fish is fresh and the service is great.  The first time in was for happy hour and we sat at the sushi bar.  A friendly sushi chef and the manager both talked about some of their selections and offered some suggestions.  Fantastic sashimi and rolls.  We came in a second time for lunch and also sat at the sushi bar.  We split a teriyaki chicken bento box, the sushi/sashimi lunch plate and also got a couple of rolls.  That was more than enough food.  The bento box was tasty.  The sashimi plate was impressive for the price and quality was superb.  Nice big cuts of fresh fish.  So tasty!  And they have fresh wasabi.  Make sure to ask for it with your sushi.  So nice to have this in the neighborhood.  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Eh. Just ok. Not bad but not a place I'm running to come back to. The lighting is awful. Zero ambiance. The server was very nice however."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ate lunch here at the sushi bar in back. It was a very good experience. It's kind of a strip mall place, but there is outdoor seating with a pass through bar to the inside, and the vibe inside is trendy and feels like a great happy hour and casual dinner kind of place. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably come here a lot.

I started with the seaweed salad and a bowl of miso soup. The seaweed came out of a very cold refrigerator! I had to turn out the bowl onto a plate and let it rest a bit before eating it. However, the portion size was generous and it tasted good.

The miso soup took me back to the first time I ever had miso--about 30 years ago in NYC. I've got to say, in that time period since there's been a lot of miso soup in my life--a lot of it buttery, cloudy, you know the drill--but the miso soup at Pure Sushi had that throwback taste I hardly ever get to experience anymore. It was smokier, fishier, and I liked that.

I like rolls, but I prefer pieces of fish. That can get tricky if you don't know what your getting is going to be fresh. I rolled the dice and won.

Started with tuna. Five pieces, rich and fresh. 

Asked for halibut, but there was not any available (which didn't deter me because that is common at sushi restaurants). So I asked the chef what he likes and he recommended the walu. It was AHH. MAAAZING!!! Walu, also called white tuna, is light, white and buttery. It was served (two pieces) over lovely seasoned rice and had a tiny dab of relish on each piece which was to die for. Such perfect bites.

Because it was lunch it was quiet and only a few tables were occupied. The chef talked to me, since I was dining alone, and that was very nice. He was friendly, made good recommendations, and is a good conversationalist.

I'd totally go here again for lunch. But it looks like they have some pretty good happy hour goodies, too, and if you go for dinner, you can count on it being fresh and to your liking."}
{"text":"Had a to go order. The food was Ok. Hostesses we're pretty snooty and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Placed a take out order tonight including both sushi as well as hot dishes.  Arrived at precisely the time they told me my order would be ready.  I checked in with the hostess, who verifies my order.  There are several to go orders on the floor, next to the hostess stand, which is right next to their front door.  Not refrigerated.  When she hands me my order, I ask if the hot foods were packaged together with the sushi.  She gives me a clueless look and the other girl, looking somewhat alarmed/concerned, said yes, everything has been put in the same bag.  I then ask how long the food has been sitting out there.  They clearly had no idea, but gave me a sheepish guesstimate of \"maybe 5-10\" minutes.  5-10 minutes of chirashi and sashimi sitting next to a door letting in 110 degree heat doesn't bode well. The two girls at the hostess station were very polite, so this is not a knock on them.  But someone should probably figure out a safer way to store takeout sushi orders that minimizes their exposure to hot, cooked dishes, as well as the hot Arizona summers.  The 2 stars is for my experience today only.  This was my 2nd visit.  My first visit was completely fine.  Hopefully someone in management reads this and makes adjustments before someone gets sick."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi places in central Phoenix. Great happy hour and awesome drinks. The service was amazing and the food quality was one of the best I have experienced in Arizona. I'm from California so it is hard to impress me with sushi in Arizona. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such great service, Phil(the manager) made sure our meal was perfect and Kristen was an amazing server. Great personality and all around just a great energy to have around. My favorite go to for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi spot in midtown! We came for happy hour! We sat at the bar and were pleasantly surprised with how great the food tasted! Not to mention the cheap happy hour prices! Drinks were delicious as well as great service from the attentive bartender! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"open now this sushi restaurant is one of the best in town !  had previously been to the Scottsdale location and enjoyed it there!  the happy hour prices let you sample some of the best choices on the menu !  
The hamachi was fresh and delicious and the crab cake was good but not excellent because of too much breading which is a mistake many restaurants make but I definitely got the impression it was fresh made!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! They tailored the sushi to my gluten intolerance and were very friendly about it. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. The ambience is beautiful."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar for happy hour and was so surprised how fresh everything was!!! Everything we ate was amazing! Will definitely come back when we are in town from California. Wish we would have found this gem from the beginning of our trip."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times, but this is my first review. The fish here tastes so fresh, which is crazy for Arizona. The prices are affordable. Lunch is amazing. You can get a huge bento box or a sushi and sashimi lunch. The best time to go is happy hour. There are rolls for only $3. Oh and they even have happy hour on weekends, from 3-6."}
{"text":"Food is always good and service is pretty good. They do a nice job.  We were able to get a table for my party of 3. The last time I was there on a Friday night with no reservation the manager HIGHLY recommend reservations. So tonight I googled Pure Sushi Colony and reservation tab directed me to YELP. So really my point here, is to YELP, Yelp. We arrived and there was no reservation. ALSO between the time I made the reso and arrived I had received TWO text messages that I have plans at 7 and it's almost time for my reservation.  So I am sure that Yelp took my reservation. They just didn't secure it Great service. I'm sticking with Open Table restaurants."}
{"text":"Pure Sushi was not very pure. Really hoping this place was going to be good. My wife got sick. 

Overpriced Fish did not taste fresh. Chewy sashimi cuts were sliced by someone who had never sliced fish in their life. 

So many better sushi restaurants in central phoenix especially for the price and sake of not getting sick. 

Hana, Sushiholic, even Sushi Station rate better."}
{"text":"It must have been an off day. Called for pick-up for a late lunch and every question I had, I had to be placed on hold. When I arrived, there was only 1 customer but it took a few minutes for someone to come to the hostess table. I ordered a sushi and sashimi combo. Let's start with the best part. In Japan, you take years of training on how to use the knife and cut the perfect part of the fish at the perfect angle. Let's come back to that. You also spend some time perfecting the rice. It's easy to cook rice but it's hard to cook it with the right consistency similar to al dente pasta. You can over cook, under cook, have it be too firm or have it be too mushy. Well folks, this is what was done right! Excellent job, rice cooker! The salmon was good but the other two sashimi items were a bit fishy (good quality sushi isn't that fishy) and the angle cut for one of them made the fish sort of sinewy as if eating a cheap cut of steak. Since it's a relatively new restaurant, I'm willing to give it another try once they work on the kinks. Some tips, package salad dressing on the side as the salad gets wilted when tossed with dressing. Do not use leaves with black/brown edges; it's just back for presentation. The dogs says thanks for some sashimi treats this afternoon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a different star rating for food and staff. The pure sunshine roll w mango was delicious. The hamachi was fresh. However, aside from Rosalyn, was not impressed."}
{"text":"Great sushi and they have the perfect drinks to compliment the food. I think happy hour at this place after a long day of work is the best way to unwind."}
{"text":"LITERALLY the worst sushi I've ever eaten.
The host acted like she'd rather rub shit in her hair than speak to us. From there we were treated to flavorless, clumsy over priced drinks, stale rice, rolls that were unraveling before they hit the table, chewy nori (how does that even happen?), low quality,old (clearly merchandised), smelly cuts of fish and mochi balls that were so old, cheap or freezer burned that even the waitress said she wouldn't recommend eating them. All this capped off with a bill DOUBLE what we would pay for double the food at FAR SUPERIOR sushi restaurants.
You'd (100% serious) be better off getting grocery store sushi and eating it at a light rail station for improved quality, service, price and ambiance."}
{"text":"Food is great!! Service is awesome especially the cutie waitress Abby, who is so personable and great waitress! Ask for her if you come to eat here! The bartender is a bit grumpy....needs a little more personality. Good thing the food makes up for it! Great place and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A great sushi restaurant. My first time here and I will be back. Tuna, yellow tail and salmon were all delicious! I forgot to mention that service was awesome. Very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service and the sushi was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place since we live close. Great sushi a d great service! We had Abby waiting on us and she was very personable and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Drove by Sunday and decide to give it a try finally.  Kim our server was very knowledgeable and prompt.   I ordered the lochness and a lollipop roll which  came out quickly and were fantastic.   Will definitely recommend and return soon."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and it was yummy! The apple pear martini is delicious and happy hour has great deals! I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times in the last six months . Happy hour is extraordinary with a good selection of wines beers sushi at a good price . Had lunch today on Sunday with friends , continues to impress . Attractive modern ambience , good food, good service , one of the new restaurants on seventh street that deserves to survive ."}
{"text":"Great first time experience.  Great sushi,  wonderful drinks and amazing  service.  Sam is amazing.  Come by for happy hour and she'll mix the best drinks!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Evening!!!!  Megan at the Bar was fabulous and attentive!  Sam on the floor was beyond helpful and able to answer any questions.  Totally recommend Pure Sushi and make sure you ask for Megan or Sam!  Thank you ladies...  We will be back for our JTS Roll weekly."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and not to crowded. It's a good local new joint to hang loose. The bartender was a little rude but oh well it is what it is"}
{"text":"Terrible slow service and dead place. No music and not happening at all. Was looking forward to eating here our second time but our last."}
{"text":"Well to summarize, I left feeling disappointed and sick. I eat sushi often and not once have I ever felt bubbles and gas immediately after eating it. My partner and I hadn't ate anything today and thought this would be a good place for a late lunch/early dinner. Sadly we were both wrong. When we entered we were the only customers at the start of happy hour. We sat at the sushi bar. The servers were mediocre and carried on talking about their personal lives in front of us and other customers that continued to walk in. We waited patiently for our food and drinks, but eventually had to remind the server for them. I noticed one of the sushi cooks take off his prep gloves at one point, take out his cell phone to reply to a text, rest his hand on the garbage can, then proceed to help his peer make a roll (which happened to be our last role, of course!). 

Now that I am at home the stomach gurgles continue and I only hope that no one else suffers in the same way. Save your money and go down the street to an authentic sushi place- the sushi station!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because it's new and it hasn't found its rhythm yet but I was disappointed. The Sushi lacked a since of style and unfortunately freshness. Sashimi wasn't sliced evenly, we ordered the Sashimi platter with Sea Bass, yellow tail, octopus, and salmon.The two stars are for the cocktails, well made with fresh ingredients. Pure Cool Cucumber and the Pure Asian Pear. Very nice drinks. Maybe with time they will improve, I hope so because we would like a closer local Sushi spot."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on Wednesday afternoon and was greeted by Greg at the door. Was well looked after throughout and was absolutely looked after as good as it gets by Greg who did such a good job that I came back for dinner and lunch the next day. Will recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a place with great food, costumer service and atmosphere! You've got yourself a new regular!"}
{"text":"Really good portions of fresh fish! This is my favorite of the Colony restaurants. The sushi/sashimi bowl and Chirashi bowls were filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful speciality sushi roll options! The king crab and baked scalloped rolls were my favorite.  The happy hour food/drinks are pretty good, especially the creamy lobster roll on happy hour. Yummmmmm. I am so glad to have a good sushi spot in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Sushi Colony!  Nice atmosphere, doesn't smell like fish, excellent rolls, impressive sake menu!  We sat at the bar and requested the Diamondbacks game.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always go during happy hour since their selection for food and drinks is pretty big. The calamari and edamame are my favorite go-tos. I've introduced a lot of people to this place and it has been nothing but praise for the food! Their sushi rolls are always varied and delicious."}
{"text":"I must say that this is our new Sushi spot!!! We've been looking for a new place  and I have to say that I am extremely satisfied with their menu and friendly/welcoming staff!!! The happy hour menu is AMAZING and the food is even BETTER!!! I highly recommend Pure Sushi Colony!!!"}
{"text":"YUM... Get the baked lobster roll... It was amazing. So good we had to order a second one. Overall, our cocktails were great, the staff was very friendly and attentive, and the sushi was very tasty. Our table ordered the ahi poke, the baked lobster rolls, California rolls, crunchy roll, and the fire dragon roll, and we enjoyed them all. We will definitely be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"They are very accommodating for those with a gluten-free diet (Hello tempura fried, how I have missed you!!!) They have a \"gluten sensitive\" menu but I actually was able to modify items not on that menu to fit my dietary needs. I was SO excited to see that they have gluten free tempura. I have never seen that and it was amazing that I could modify the roll that I wanted to be gluten free, even though it contained tempura shrimp. They also have gluten free soy sauce, as expected.

The service was great. Our server was very patient with me questions and was at our table often to check on us. 

The sushi is very reasonably priced - we got two rolls (speciality rolls), one order sashimi, one order of nigiri and an entree for around $55. Not bad at all! And it was all very yummy! Also was so happy to find surf clam (it's very hard to find in Phoenix)!!"}
{"text":"I found this place via recommendation from a friend in Scottsdale.  Sushi is fantastic and lunch time server , Kim is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Creamy baked lobster roll, thumbs up!  Pure Vegas roll, thumbs up! Shrimp dynamite, you guessed it, thumbs up!! Cool atmosphere in here. Sushi came out super quick and me and my lady had no problem smashing three rolls! If sushi isn't your thing, they have other options on the menu as well. Next time I'm here, I'm going for the Hamachi Kama.....yellowtail cheek. So good!! They have a good sized bar and a few TVs playing games on them too!"}
{"text":"We eat sushi often and had been referred to this place by a friend.  The space is nice. Our waitress was nice. The rest is mediocre at best.  They cut the rolls and serve the pieces side by side flat to make it appear you are getting a huge roll.  The rice was watery and the tuna sashimi looked grey on the edge. We ordered several items to try and not one was something I would eat again.  The scallop roll had no visible scallops. Heading back to Wild Tuna, Moto, or Sushi Station next time.

Update- driving home sick to my stomach.  Ugghhh"}
{"text":"Service was amazon. I didn't have to wait a long time. Ordering was easy and I didn't ya e to wait very long for the food. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Newest sushi spot in midtown. Its classy, modern, fun and delicious. I stopped by after work for a beer and a roll once I saw they opened... And 100% satisfied I am! Great service, awesome rolls and sashimi. So glad that I don't have to go all the way downtown or to Biltmore for good sushi anymore. Will return fo sho :)"}
{"text":"If you really like sushi and the experience, this is not the place to go.. Soccer player on the TV's, some of the staff are really unprofessional, one waiter was doing pull up's on the I beam between the kitchen and the sushi bar. Food was delivered out of order, Sushi came, then soup... Don't waste your money.."}
{"text":"Came into Pure for te first time yesterday for happy hour. Got there around 4:30 and was surprised to see the place pretty empty. We walked in and saw three hostesses all waiting to help us, or so we thought. We walked in, were briefly greeted, and then upon asking us how many, the hostesses proceeded to look among each other almost to see who really wanted to help us first. Not the most welcoming experience at first. We were seated and within seconds, waters were filled which was nice. Our server came up almost immediately and asked if we wanted anything besides water. We weren't sure just yet since we literally just sat down, but soon found some drinks we wanted: white cosmos. 

Ordered some sushi, all of which was delicious. Rainbow roll, spicy tuna rolls, and an avocado roll. Very tasty. 

Now here's the issue. Drinks didn't come out to us until after our sushi was delivered. When we finally received them, they were wrong. When we asked our server about them, she proceeded to tell us that what we ordered was what we received. Obviously not. These drinks are supposed to have raspberry vodka but instead tasted like peach or pear and had a cherry at the bottom. Our server proceeded to tell us that we were tasting the peach schnapps. Our server didn't seem to believe is still, and pulled out the menu to look. Our drinks were supposed to have three ingredients, none of which are peach schnapps or cherries. She took our drinks back and we were eventually given new ones. The bartender brought them out, apologized, and said that's how she was trained to make them but had to look up the recipe. By this time our sushi was gone so we just had to sit and sip the drinks. 

Overall, not the greatest service experience, but did was good, which is what gives this review 3 stars. Will consider coming back since the sushi is good and it's close to home, but not right away."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sushi at a great price! I got the spicy yellowtail and spicy salmon rolls, both with no rice. The selection was super tasty, and the miso soup was delicious. We had great service from Roslyn as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pure sushi is very tasty. Sushi is inexpensive although the sushi rolls are slightly smaller than an average roll. happy hour is from 11-6 on the weekends. Very cool atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"We made a reservation  for 6pm. The place was not busy but we had to park on the sides . The rolls are a little  pricey. The server did not know the menu which is not good,one of our guest was allergic to shell fish. My tempura was not cooked the vegetable  was not cooked . The tempura shrimp  was good   the teriyaki  chicken was a chicken  breast that was way overcooked  and a light amount of sauce. There was too much Bell peppers winter the vegetables. The service  was OK, one of the rolls came about 15 minutes  late with no explanations . I left hungry. This is not a restaurant  that I would recommend. Smaller  portions  with higher  prices"}
{"text":"So disappointed :( I loved this place for their quality, service, and menu options but was so disgusted by my last visit. 
None of the food I ordered was good (aside from edamame). The miso soup tasted like straight ocean and not in a good way. The nigiri I ordered were all very fishy and some slices were even dry. There was even a slice that was not only very fishy, but had sinew and was extremely difficult to eat. The fish in my roll had the same fishy taste.  
I really hope this was just a one time deal, but if they're not watching their quality of products then I don't believe I'd come back. 
I was even talking this place up the night before returning and now I feel dumb :("}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch and it was busy for lunch. Kim greeted my friend and I at the door. And sat us at a booth \"bonus\" for it being busy and filled. Asked her which bento box was the best and she recommended the salmon, which was amazing!!! Cooked perfect and my friend got the sushi lunch which she recommended a great salad to go with it. Passion fruit tea hit the spot!! Definitely hit the spot great service from Kim who was all smiles and having a great time with us making us feel like we were regulars and just chatting with us. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent happy hour place in my neck of the woods, within the 7th Street dining strip of central Phoenix. Informal, soothing atmosphere, friendly and efficient service, and the happy hour specials are amazing: really good sushi, tempura, and other items at prices that are incredibly low. Parking is not an issue even though it looks limited at the front; here is parking at the side and in the back of the Colony complex."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi joints I've tried in Phoenix. 
Octopus was cooked well, sashimi was fresh, and the toro was great."}
{"text":"Kim is the bestest server ever! It's like coming home every time. She remembers my orders from previous visits and takes care of everyone the same fantastic way."}
{"text":"Nice food, nice ambiance, but our waitress was too attentive. Think literally every 2-3 minutes she was there. Don't come here if you actually want to talk to people you are with."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Waitress was personalable.  The sushi and sashimi was perfectly proportioned."}
{"text":"2.5 stars... Long story short... meh. This is too much Scottsdale in Central Phoenix. 

Slow early evening on a Saturday... only 2 other couples at the bar, nobody at the sushi bar, and 3 parties in the dining area. While the staff at the bar was friendly, they were more social with their fellow staff than with the customers. While its fine to talk with co workers, this should not come at the price of inattentive service... especially when its slow! They failed to serve our fist course (edamame), brought out the third course (desert of chocolate mouse) within 5 minutes of bringing out the entree', and when a to go box was requested for items, it was merely dropped in our dining space rather than graciously boxing the food for us. I'm not usually one to require a server to do this as I was a server and bartender for years and can easily accomplish the task, but for the prices and pretentiousness this place exudes, the service was definitely not above the bar. Again... they didn't fail (well, except with the edamame) and the items were tasty, but there is a disconnect in the service that again feels more superficial than what locals usually experience in Central Phoenix..."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, fresh, with generous sized portions, THE ONLY PLAVE WITH REAL FRESH WASABI, even happy hour- great menu with TOP SHELF alcohol. The staff was professional and offered excellent service the entire time. Manager was visible and checked in with the guests. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I had what i consider the best the menu had to offer and all was good.  However one plate haunts my pallet; The LOCK NESS roll!   I have been eating sushi for 20 years.  I've had sushi in Japan and i boast of many other alcolades in regard to my sushi history which adds to my rich credibility to this specific epicurean experience which the world has come to appreciate....

This Lock Ness Roll (primarily the side in the red sauce) is a perfect bite and i think will please anyone who prefers subtleties of sashimi, although this is not traditional.  

The rice-free LOCK NESS ROLL, is an experience in texture and flavour.  Although the sauce offers a bold explosion on the taste buds, the sauce subsides almost immediately allowing one to sense the subtle combination of salmon avocados and asparagus, which is revealed to the olfactory in layers in that order.  

This roll is most likely not going to be appreciated by the typical western sushi afficcionado who drowns every bite in soy sauce.  This is a concoction for  those who have a refined pallet.  There is no need to add soy sauce or Ponzu, for the (red, not green) sauce truly makes this roll powerfully bold without overwhelming the subtleties reminiscent of sashimi, but with a more gregarious sabor. 

I consider this a perfect Fusion of East meets west.  Thank you for this creation.  The Lock Ness Roll is a true event in culinary arts, I hope you enjoy it too."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place yesterday for take-out. It was completely dead at 11:15 am. I ordered a Vegas Roll and the duck steamed buns. Sadly, they were out of the steamed buns? Are these not made fresh? The Vegas Roll was pretty standard but I did like that when you get it to go, they put the sauces on the side so the roll doesn't get mushy. I did like being able to control how much sauce was on my roll too. My one roll was $13 plus tax so a little pricey but overall I think this would be a good happy hour sushi spot. Staff was very friendly and service was quick (if it wasn't, since I was the only one there, that would have been very disturbing)."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I don't understand how this place has a 4 star rating. Come on yelpers! I really wanted to like this place as it is a 3 minute drive from where I live. I was extremely excited when I found out that there was a sushi place opening up and that I might perhaps have a new sushi place to go to besides the usual sushi spots around the area. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were very disappointed. It was a mediocre sushi place; the rolls weren't great and the appetizers weren't anything special (calamari, gyoza, seaweed salad). I came back a few weeks later to give it another shot and was just disappointed once again. The service is definitely excellent and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"This might be the best bang for your buck in the sushi scene in Phoenix. The happy hour prices are ridiculously cheap. Seriously. The spicy salmon roll is excellent and the quality of their rice is on point.

As my buddy Steven Kay taught me, one must always order a side of eel sauce and sriracha to go along with any roll to make it seem like a speciality roll. I'm so stoked that this spot is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Paid $10 bucks for salmon sashimi that was cut so thin you could see through it and was not fresh. Definitely the older batch of the salmon, if it's sashimi don't use it if it's old. Just gross. 

Got the firecracker specialty roll, the cilantro was good and that's it. Super expensive for the size of their roll! 

Not coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"Love this place, The sushi is excellent!  But what makes this even better is Kim the server/bartender!  She is by far the best and always makes you feel so welcomed!  
Traci & Chris"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood, rolled
in for happy hour and everything was actually really good. Cool decor, good drinks and fresh sushi. My only thing was that it can definitely get a bit pricey pretty quickly. Good spot for a date or special occasion but not an everyday place unless you have unlimited funds!! Lol"}
{"text":"Friends wanted to give this place a try -- the same friend that took me up to another Fishy place in Scottsdale, wanted to give this place a try. Very chic -- love the atmosphere. Friends loved the Sushi here. Service was and staff were great. Friends ate and I enjoyed a few Martinis - definitely worth a try. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Great service. How ever the food was not so great, seaweed salad had a pond water  after taste! Gyoza had no flavor and dipping sauce lacked flavor!  It's just bad sushi."}
{"text":"First off, I think their prices are slightly 1-2 dollars on average higher than a comparable sushi place around central phoenix. And frankly, we did not find their fish to be very fresh. Service for the 2 times we've dined here have been great though. Whats nice about this place is that they have a lot of different food options for those who be there with other friends and family who do not care for sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best Happy Hour in Phoenix, and they have Megan, the Best Bartender in Phoenix as well.  The food is always great, they have a nice selection of wine and beer and it's within walking distance. My favorite new place in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow - what an absolutely amazing happy hour!  We stopped in last Sunday and couldn't believe the extensive happy hour menu for drinks and food.  We both enjoyed a pear martini (so yummy!) and then ordered edamame, pork gyoza, and several rolls all at extremely discounted prices.  The atmosphere is lively and modern, the bartender was super friendly and helpful and the food/drink was not only reasonably priced, but also super delicious!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pure has the freshest fish I have encountered in Arizona! The decor is sleek and modern and the wait staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Was going to grab some food and drinks at the Yard, but my date and I decided to check out this place for the first time instead (The Yard was packed, it happens). Anyways, super glad we decided to check this place out! 
It was about an hour or so before close, we decided to sit up at the bar, and our bartender was, Megan. She was super friendly & knowledgeable regarding our questions about the menu. She mixed us THE BEST drinks, and the sushi was soo good! Loved the spicy salmon roll! I totally recommend this place to anyone in the area feeling like going out for sushi because this place killed it on its service, sushi, drinks, and overall ambiance. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy Hamachi, Batman! This place is awesome! 

First, you will not find a friendlier and more helpful waitstaff. When you stop in make sure you say \"Hi\" to the manager Phil and ask him for his recommendations.  His suggestions were perfect each time.

Second, the ambience is modern and sleek with a cool tree motive. The tables have phone charges built right in to the wall and if that wasn't enough, It even has a basket in the bathroom large enough to hide in. No kidding. Check it out yourself.  Ask Phil about it, he will fill you in on the cool interior design.

And last, and most importantly, the food and beverage choices.  I have eaten a lot of Sushi, some even fresh, right off the hook while on the boat, and this blows them all away.  The traditional dishes, sashimi, miso soup, sushi, etc are what you would expect, but better and fresher.  Make sure you ask for the fresh wasabi to go with these.  The rolls and fusion style dishes are fun and inventive.  The Shrimp Dynamite was...well dynamite.  They also have the largest Saki selection that I have ever seen.  Phil selected a light Saki for us that was crisp and slightly sweet and went perfect with the food.

So in summary: the restaurant is cool, the food is fantastic and Phil is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Will be coming back when I'm in town again. I love the creativity behind the rolls and even though busy for one/two people... staff was on top of it!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't like sushi, I would definitely give this place a try! My boyfriend had been wanting to try Pure Sushi for happy hour ever since we moved into the area, and over the weekend we finally did. After trying it, I think we'll definitely be back sometime soon :) 

Happy hour is from 3-6p, and it's every day, which I think is great because my boyfriend and I have a hard time making it that early on weekdays after work. So the fact that they have it on the weekend is awesome, and it wasn't even very crowded. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive, taking our orders soon after we sat down.

For our meal, we ordered the Shrimp Tempura, the Ika Tempura (Calamari), and the Korean BBQ Grilled Pork Ribs. The portions weren't huge, but it filled us up and everything was delicious! I also ordered a beer and my boyfriend got a large sake - the bill was still only $30! Definitely a great spot when you're looking to not spend a ton :)"}
{"text":"Clean, trendy, fast and friendly service, high quality sushi.  My only objection is not having descriptions of what was in the different rolls. Highly recommend the sushi lollipops and the gyoza. I still had leftovers after an early dinner, but they didn't survive the night."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere is very modern and cool
We were greeted by friendly hostesses and our server is a very sweet young woman from Thailand , I forget her name but she was GREAT . The Sushi was fantastic! 

We ordered the calamari and Tuna appetizers they were both excellent. 

We then ordered 2 special Rolls WOW ! 
Both presentation and of course taste were 
Beyond our expectations . The fish was Fresh as could be and perfect temperature . 

We give Pure Sushi FIVE STARS !!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was superb.  All the food was fresh & perfectly prepared and presented.  Will definitely refer friends and come back again."}
{"text":"Pure Sushi is a great little location for happy hour. Their Happy Hour menu rivals any other Sushi restaurant in town. The service was great and the Sushi came out fast. They are also very accommodating for people who have gluten allergies. Ask for the GF menu."}
{"text":"First timers... SEEMED LIKE A NICE SPOT TO TRY NEW SUSHI ...good location ... KIND OF A SMALL PLACE .. has a nice bar and when weathers right outside patio works well... service was good... overall a great dining experience.. only thing was the sushi itself... it was just ok..  I would still prefer Yama just down the street ... you try it and tell me for yourself???"}
{"text":"Excellent!! I am gluten sensitive and Tyler was super knowledgeable.  Very fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was horrific. We left our food on the table (what was actually brought out) paid for I have no idea what ($75) AND had to go somewhere else to eat dinner.  All the waiter did was apologize because they were too busy.  The bartender (this is not an over exaggeration) was wiping her nose, running her fingers through her hair and sloppily drinking out of a large styrofoam cup - where's the health department when you need them?  Keep driving down 7th and go to Harumi.  Never will I enter this place again."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna had a terrible smell and consistency and that's what I base my reviews off of when it comes to fresh fish at any sushi restaurant. I literally couldn't even eat it"}
{"text":"Haven't had udon in for ever and that brought me to my happy place. Kristen our server was amazing really great attitude and company ;) 
Special thanks to Phil your always great 

Definitely recommend this as dinner for anyone looking for something for a nice treat or a special dinner for a special someone"}
{"text":"Food was fine. BUT the water glass I was given had lipstick marks on it and as I picked up a piece a small bug walked out under it. I wouldn't come here again seeing that, don't recommend it. Prices aren't all that outside of happy hour. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in town! Just spectacular! The food, the presentation, the ambience, and the service is not to be matched anywhere!!! This has become one of our new favorites!! Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"We had a double date there with friends for the first time! It was an enjoyable evening. The atmosphere is nice but is was a bit noisy when crowed- so many restaurants don't seem to focus on buffering the noise levels. I wish they would...it can effect the evening if you have to talk loudly over a table to hear the conversation. The meals were all delicious and everyone was happy with the presentation! The service was friendly and made some great suggestions off the menu. It's nice when servers are pleasant and helpful! We had a wonderful evening and will return again! Thanks"}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the sushi selection. I got the pure pear martini and it was amazing! A great local place to grab a cocktail and dinner."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Sat at the Sushi Bar and had poor service from waitress, but the chef was very attentive.  For sure  will be back again if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is aight. Food and service were pretty good but not amazing. Ordered the coconut tiger shrimp as a starter, which is 4 deep fried shrimps drizzled with some dark salty sauce and 2 dips (sweet chili and some mango flavored one). It was tasty but  kind of salty, heavily breaded, not very coconut-y, and kind of pricey. My mom ordered the nabeyaki udon, which was good and came in a cool bowl but the broth was too salty. I ordered the salmon and avocado rice bowl, which is kind of like a poke bowl. It was fine but the rice to toppings ratio was a bit high and there wasn't enough sauce so it was pretty dry and not that flavorful. I really wanted to like this place but overall the food is just ok."}
{"text":"Very mediocre for the price.   Doesn't get you very far over a basic sushi joint like Ra.  Probably the most chewy Toro (tuna belly) I have ever had.   The Uni was fresh enough.  Some interesting menu items unique to the chain 

What really rubbed me wrong the the major D Bag of a manager for this place. Struts over in his suit and asks how everything is... and then walks away when my friends mother was complimenting the food.  He goes \"oh yeah that.. uh... beef thing is good\".  Dude if you don't give a sh!t, don't go around pretending to.  People can see thru your BS especially when you turn your back to them after asking a question!  Can't believe he works at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came here with a good friend on Friday for lunch.  No customers there at 11:15 am.

I ordered the Edamame, Nabeyaki Udon and WTF (Sea Bass Tempura) roll.  She ordered the yellowtail sushimi lunch.  The Nabeyaki Udon tasted like soy sauce mixed with water microwave heated.  The soup was inedible.  Not sure how anyone could eat that.  I ended up trying to find the few pieces of shrimp and scallops in the soup.  That tasted like it was quickly like it was quickly thawed from something that was stored in the freezer for way too long.  Maybe they should hire someone who knows what they are doing.  Never order Udon from this place.  I can make 10 times better Udon broth at home.

The WTF Roll was good.  I actually liked it.  I would give the WTF Roll 4 stars by itself.

My friend said the yellowtail sushimi wasn't up to their usually standard but decent.  Edamame was good but its hard to get that one wrong. :)

Waitress wasn't very bright.  She kept on getting the order wrong for both of us."}
{"text":"The sushi was just okay. We went here for dinner and had nigiri sushi. We had tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, salmon and unagi. These are our go to favorites at every sushi place and it always a debate of what we thought was more delicious than the others for each place. But, here at Pure, all of it was disappointing. I wouldn't come here again, it's overpriced and the environment is pretty tacky. All that being said the service was alright."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi restaurant. The food is always superb and service is sot on. Kristen is my usual waiter and she's amazing. Great personality. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite happy hour spots! Most of the items are $3-4 - Rolls are $3-8 and there are items like potstickers/goyza ($3) and pork sliders ($4) for your non-sushi-eating friends. 

With the discount, drinks drop to about $4 too!

Pro tip: Don't let the crowded parking in front intimidate you. There's a HUGE parking lot in the back. :)"}
{"text":"Sunday Funday afternoon with my family. It was happy hour and the specials were great!! The food was good but not fantastic, glad it was happy hour cause would of been disappointing if we paid full price. Downtown Phoenix definitely not busy for a Sunday afternoon. Nice service they were polite. Enjoyed walking around after dinner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with a friend. I read all of the other reviews and all I can figure out is that everyone comes here for the happy hour deals and must have a few before reviewing this place.
The atmosphere is trendy/chic. No complaint there. We were greeted promptly, but it was weird. We walked in and from the back the manager shouts \"How do I look?\" My friend replies \"great \". He walks towards us and repeats his question. My friend told him she already said he looked great,but that she must not have heard her. He said well \"You look amazing. How are you? How have you been?\"
The whole exchange was kind of awkward since neither of us had ever met him before. It got more strange when the manager told my friend to pick a spot we could sit anywhere and as she moved toward a booth he said \"but not in a booth\". She took it as kidding, but honestly he didnt say anything to us .
Anyway, we tried the calamari, it was rubbery and tasteless, the pesto sauce that accompanied it was thin, oily and did nothing to add flavor. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Next we ordered a caterpillar roll, a fiery dragon roll and a California roll. I must admit the caterpillar roll wasn't too bad, but there was nothing exceptional about it. I wouldn't order a California roll again it was dull and bland. The fiery dragon was one of the specialty rolls and it was a disappointment.  The fish wasn't fresh, it would have no flavor whatsoever if not for the jalapeno and cilantro. But there was no fusion of flavor instead the first taste was bland,  the less than fresh fish didn't help, and then your mouth just burned from the jalapeno.
Finally, we were never offered refills of our water, we waited for over 15 minutes after we had finished for our check despite the manager and our server walking past us frequently. Maybe we just hit on an off day."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant a second try- still was
not impressed. Had the gyoza, salmon spicy sushi, tempura and lobster sushi. Gyoza would have been better if it was fried. Best thing out of everything i ordered
 is the lobster sushi but still wasn't that good. Service is good. Not going back for a long time."}
{"text":"My son and his family took me here for my birthday.   We shared the edamame and the pork gyoza.   Of course, can't really do much with edamame, and the gyoza aka potstickers tasted like those I get at Costco or Trader Joe's.   In other words, nothing special.  

I ordered the ikura nigiri and shrimp tempura for my dinner.  The nigiri was as good as I expected.   And the tempura was light and fluffy.   My daughter-in-law ordered the yakisoba.   I don't think she liked it.  My granddaughter did, though.    I tasted it.   Not impressed.   I don't know what the seasoning was but I didn't like it.   My granddaughter ordered the udon.   I think she thought the noodles were too thick.   I liked the dashi and the noodles.   In fact, I took the rest of it home.   My son ordered the baked sea bass.   I didn't taste it, but he said it was good.

I dunno.   I was not really impressed with the place.   Judging by how empty it is, I am thinking others are not flocking to the place.   It could have been cause it was cinco de mayo and everyone else was out celebrating that.   No idea."}
{"text":"Quality and service were top notch at Pure last night. Haven't found any great sushi places in the valley. But this one now tops the list. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Likes: Easy to find, modern decor, clean, lunch specials, sushi. 

My only complaint was there was 1 server for the entire restaurant so I wasn't greeted and service was kinda slow. She did a good job just wish there were more servers. It could just have been because it was lunch but even 1 more server could have made the experience better.

Overall, I would come back!"}
{"text":"A must have is the king salmon sushi and the lockness roll. If you're looking for a bowl the salmon and avocado bowl is also very tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I just got done throwing up after eating here last night. Service was really good but definitely got food poisoning from the sushi. Will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"The location is good. Ordered the bento box and arrived on a plate. The food was good. Décor and the blue theme is good."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Wow i have been missing out!   Beautiful restaurant and the food is fantastic ! Sushi, salads and Bento boxesService is awesome.   Food is hot fresh and lots of it."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot, so we asked for the chef to create a something based on his knowledge of us. This is Josie's dish. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Ordered three things from the full memo, although the HH menu sounded pretty good, I wanted more. 
I love drinks with basil and ginger but the one they had wasn't as yummy (can't remember the name). 
Everything else was made to perfection and super fresh!"}
{"text":"Warm plates mixed with raw sashimi is never a good mix. Basically served warm sashimi. We haven't been back. There is no in between with this type of food. Either good or not."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place is amazing!! 

My boyfriend and i decided to go on a lil sunday date night and do sushi, we are so pleased we will defenitly be returning customers! 

Started off with our awesomely funky server samantha! Ask for her, she is happy and full of smiles, i love that when i eat out. What goes best with sushi? SAKE! she suggested a chrysanthamum water and it was delicious! 

The whole meal was spot on!! 

Things to definitely try:

Ahi & avocado poke- its kind of like a sushi take on open face nachos but instead of torrilla chips the poke is on taro chips. Yumm yumm! The small details of parmesan cheese and truffle oil pull it together.

Loch ness roll- this thing. Wow!! Its a roll.. but not like you have ever experienced!! There is no rice or seaweed, the outside is literally wrapped in salmon! Very colorful and visually has a yin yang vibe. It has a nice flavor, kinda spicy with a dab of sriracha on top and fresh with cilantro avocado and asparagus. Can i have this everyday please?!

Hamachi spoons- yellowtail wrapped around avocado with some fresh zesty sauce served in soup spoons. Super fun presentation and will cool you down on any hot summer day.

Our dinner was absolutely delightful, also make sure to order some FRESH wasabi this stuff will make you never want that green mushie stuff again."}
{"text":"Love it here. Exceptional service, friendly staff, great happy hour, and really good, fast sushi. Absolutely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I would have rated this 5 stars originally.  The food has been going a little bit down hill but still a great spot.  I've dined here 15-20 times since it's opened and it remains on our \"good list.\"  Word has gotten out and it's been getting more popular.  They need to do a little better job in keeping food quality high with the larger crowds.  Service is and always has been fantastic."}
{"text":"Please do your self a favor and come here for happy hour. 

The rolls are super cheap like $3 for salmon, philly, or cali rolls and $6 for some other ones. The salmon was so fresh and so butter-y omg I loved it. Also, you can't go wrong for $3 sushi rolls?! I'm sure Walmart or Frys sells those packaged sushi for way more and that is just awful. 

Also, the server was super sweet. She probably thought I was a cow for ordering more rolls twice and inhaling them as soon as they came to the table though.

Great spot! 10/10- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I finally came to dine for some sushi. Word of advice: if the name of the restaurant has a specific food name, you order that because it is probably their most popular dish. The last time I had their food, I ordered yakisoba to go, not sushi. It was awful. This time I ordered sushi: the lochness sushi and the hoke poke roll based on other reviews. We also ordered the miso spicy butter edamame to start. 

First off, the decor and ambiance was fancy. I really liked it. They even offered a nice looking highchair for my daughter. The only con is that they do not have a changing diaper table in the restroom. Our waitress was the only waitress in the restaurant and she worked the room well. 

Skip the spicy miso butter edamame. I did not enjoy it, but the sushi was amazing. Each roll though had only eight small pieces for $15-$16 a roll. Kinda pricy to me. I took advantaged of the check in offer of 15% off your bill so that helped a bit. Overall, good sushi and good ambiance."}
{"text":"Here a couple times a month, and I'm never disappointed with the great food!! Jodi mar does a great job with the preparation of the sushi!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while visiting Phoenix.... truly a great time! Greg was absolutely amazing and treated us with true hospitality from the heart. I would hands down recommend to anyone. Thank you Greg you're an amazing human!"}
{"text":"fried calamari - pretty good
salmon teriyaki bento box - pretty good
we had a bunch of sushi that was above average tasting: 
a) eel avocado roll
b) caterpillar roll
c) rainbow roll
d) baked scallop roll
e) crispy tempura roll
f) loch ness roll
g) pure vegas roll
h) wtf roll
i) philly roll
service was pretty good"}
{"text":"No matter the time the photos always great service  superb but the food is the best sushi in central Phoenix hands down check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"All around an unfortunate experience. Stopped in for happy hour to test this place out before a full splurge on a sushi dinner. I would have found more enjoyment in cutting up my individual $1 bills and creating some sort of wreath or maybe a tiny Christmas tree. Anything but choking down super tough seaweed, eating Fry's sushi counter grade rolls while dodging the glaring looks from a lackluster waitress. Especially loved watching the chef slick his greasy hair into his little cap and not wash his hands before throwing his gloves on. Yummy. 

I hope whatever replaces this joint does a better job."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant for lunch yesterday with two co-workers and the waitress that served us was very rude. When she was waiting on her other tables she had a smile on her face, but any time she came over to our table she looked annoyed to be talking to us. I had ordered chicken Katsu and when the food arrived it looked great. Unfortunately, I took a couple of bites of it and it was like a rubbery texture so I had my co-workers try a piece each and they agreed. It made me lose my appetite and I let the waitress know that it has a super weird texture. She then said \"well it looks like you've eaten some of it so.....?\" Not once did she apologize. I get that people have their off days but she was blatantly rude to us and for absolutely no reason. This was the worst customer service that I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Discovered this treasure during the Sriracha Festival 2016.  I was introduced to their Ahi & Avocado Poke on a taro chip, but obviously they added Sriracha to that tasting.  I did order it at this restaurant and it was not served with Sriracha, but it was equally as delicious.  We also had their Gyoza, & Shrimp Tempura, but I did not take pics of them since they are standards.  but we did order their happy hour items along with their drinks and it was all good:  Crunch Roll, Fire Dragon Roll & Philly Roll.  Along with Korean Ribs, Lettuce Wraps...The service was ok, our waitress was attentive but really didn't seem like she was all that thrilled to either specifically serve us or in general.  But that's ok, like I said, she was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"The service is incredible, I visited for the first time and was greeted by the manager and felt immediately welcome. The sushi chef kept a conversation the whole time and I love experiencing new people and new places! The seaweed salad is something I love and haven't had as fresh as living in Hawaii! I'm so thankful to have found this in AZ!!"}
{"text":"I really had high expectations while ordering. And although the food actually tasted pretty good, the entire time I was eating,  I couldn't get over the small portion size for the amount of $. I guess the experience may have been better had we gone in for happy hour, but as you can see from the picture, this is really a very small amount of food for $50. I"}
{"text":"Great atomosphere and the food keeps me coming back!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Do not think they serve sushi grade fish here.  Ordered  coconut shrimp appetizer which was overdone and horrible.  Soft shell crab roll aka spider roll had fake crab in the middle of the roll!  The ends had soft shell crab that was COLD!  Spicy tuna roll was ok.  Veggie tempura disappointing variety:  sweet potato x 2-3, onion and white potato.  Did not get anything green in there and no carrot tempura either.  Very expensive for what we got and we don't drink.  I'd make it $$$"}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious!! The sushi and sashimi lunch is filling and beautiful. Comes with your choice of miso soup or a house salad"}
{"text":"This is my second time at the brand new sushi restaurant in north central Phoenix and this was better than the first time.  The sushi was fresh and absolutely amazing. The drinks were beyond wonderful and and were more then plentiful. The service was absolutely amazing and Sam our server was extremely helpful.  She knows her sushi for sure, and recommended the most amazing rolls for us to try.  

I would definitely keep coming back to Pure Sushi and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great night out.   The north central corridor has been lacking a quality sushi restaurant, and I think we finally have a great one."}
{"text":"Our first time at Pure Sushi Colony and it was amazing. Great atmosphere, service and food quality. Celebrated my 28th birthday today 7/20 over lunch  we are definitely coming back thanks and shout out to chef Sebastian
#salmon/Avocado bowl
#crunchy roll"}
{"text":"Pure Sushi Colony- Interesting name! I would be a dangerous inhabitant of a land colonized purely by sushi. My eating habits would cause everyone to soon be on the endangered sushi list!

We came here for the great happy hour deals. On the happy hour menu they offer various nigiri sushi, rolls, and small bites. We ordered a few rolls, lettuce wraps, sliders, and some poke. The spicy tuna lettuce wraps were cool, crisp, and refreshing. The sliders were pretty basic, pulled pork with bbq sauce. The poke was an interesting presentation in that it was served on taro chips, kind of like an Asian tostada. I liked the marinade in the poke and the fish was fresh. The rolls were a great deal for happy hour at $3 each.

Service was friendly and warm. 

I'll definitely be back for more sushi!"}
{"text":"Okay sushi
Lacking atmosphere 
Ask waiter to suggest a roll after we order the sushimi platter and he proceeded to ask us if we like raw fish?
Creepy mid 30 year old manager flirting/harassing waitresses back by the sushi bar was distracting and annoying but mostly just sad.  
If you want to go- go soon before it closes, but save your money and go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Came here for happy once and I was very pleased and then decided to order some for delivery and I was VERY disappointed! Half of my order was wrong and the rest of it lacked quality. None of it tasted fresh and the chicken katsu was soggy and made me gag."}
{"text":"If this was a sporting event it would be like one team didn't even show up. I think this was the worse experience I have had in a long time! We came in to an empty restaurant. After a few minutes standing up front, noticing the manager on his cell phone and employees standing around talking, someone finally came by to say we could sit anywhere grabbing menus, you would think to follow us. My husband and I choice to sit outside. No menus were handed to us or came behind us. After sitting for a bit, I just went in and got some menus. We had enough time to figure out what we wanted for dinner before our server brought out some water. We placed an order of edamame and 5 rolls, which he repeated back. Not long after one of the employees brought out 3 of the 5 rolls and no edamame. My husband and I not waiting to wait for the rest ate all three rolls as we were hungry. Our server came back a while after we finished and asked if we needed anything else and I replied \"maybe the rest of our dinner\" and my husband added \"and some water\" as he was out. He said he was going to go check on it. He left and came right back to having no idea what we ordered so I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and said so I hear you asked to speak to me, I said YES, let me start with when we first walked in and explaining everything above. He explained everyone dropped the ball, and our meal was on us. I don't think the ball was ever pick up and I asked for the owner or GMs information to them know about our magical experience. He left to go get the GMs card and well we were waiting no water was brought or the rest of our order. We then hear inside our server said to another employee \"I don't care I didn't do anything wrong.\" The manager still not wanting to correct the situation by refilling water or the rest of our dinner brought out his card, the GMs card and a gift card to ask us back. Well since I now had to go home and make dinner since we did not get to eat, I can't see myself returning. Small details as the whole experience was horrible but I had to go inside and get my saucer for soy sauce and soy sauce as ours was empty at our table."}
{"text":"Very excited to have such a fun downtown location for sushi     
Same excellent menu as the original Pure Sushi in N Scottsdale! Good happy hour and great value. 

We enjoyed the Pure Asian Pear Martini and ice cold Sapporo. Fire dragon and the White Monster rolls were tasty and fresh. Ask for fresh Wasabi on the side, great alternative to the usual green stuff. 

Clinton and Phil were very friendly and helpful. Thanks for creating such an amazing interior design too. We're looking forward to more original art work."}
{"text":"My experience was limited, I ordered carry out, but the restaurant looked very inviting (although relatively empty for a Friday evening) and the sushi was well prepared and tasted decent. 

My overall experience was disappointing due to the hostesses. There were three and they were in need of basic training. When I walked into the restaurant they stared at me rather than greet me. I took the initiative to tell them I was picking up an order and one of the hostesses handed me a bill (still without saying anything). I paid and finally one spoke, thanking me, and said she'd get my order. Two of the hostesses walked away. The hostess who remained began talking to a friend. She told her friend all about how much staff turnover the restaurant was experiencing, how she was training the woman who had just walked away, how another staff member had been fired because she lied about her age and other restaurant gossip. 

Given the prices on the menu, I would hope staff would be taught to create a positive experience and environment. I might go back, but I'll likely go somewhere else if I'm craving sushi again."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to pure on Mother's Day. i been to pure in Scottsdale and I have never encounter any  bad experiences but this location was the exception. Everything was fine until I checked my bank account and notice I was being charged more than what I had paid for my total was 178 and I left cash tip so I wasn't expecting to see 208 dollars charge on my card. Clearly the server decided that it was ok to STEAL from his customers and add an extra tip to himself. When I called the manager was not helpful she said she was going to look into it and call back but she never bother to call back. So I had to call them again and finally they reimburse my money. The manager tried to make excuses for his dishonest employee. So be careful when going here."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, amazing happy hour..... I'm not a big fan of sushi but I would eat here on the regular. Really nice place!"}
{"text":"I would normally give 4 stars, but this is AZ.   There aren't too many good sushi joints here, so this place stands out for the area.   We're from CA and there seems to be better sushi there all around.   

My Wife had the yakisoba and it was awesome!   Highly suggest that.   

I've been 20 times or so and always get rolls and nigiri.   It's better than most around here, but again, it's not the best we've ever had.  

Definitely worth trying.   Ambiance is really good.   Staff is attentive.   Management seems involved on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit this week, Shrimp coconut and Rainbow rolls are delicious. Love the fire dragon roll. Servers are nice, friendly ambience Friends are having bbq ribs, gyoza, ikura, quail eggs. All is spectacular!"}

{"text":"I am back to Phoenix after living in Peoria, AZ for the last 12+ years. It was suggested by my hairstylist that I try Pure Colony as I would not be disappointed. They could not be more spot on! Pure Colony is a hip and happening place, it's wait staff very welcoming and friendly. Their Sushi is best I have had since being in Phoenix. So, if you're new in town or just returning back to the valley try it you won't be disappointed! I'm definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour, great service, great menu & the sushi/sashimi/nigiri is delish! Try to stop in when Megan is behind the bar, she's the best!"}

{"text":"I was hankering for sushi at lunchtime, so I went to Pure on 7th St. However, when I walked in the restaurant, the smell of bleach (coming from the bar?) was overwhelming. I left and ended up going to Hana."}
{"text":"This is my first time here at this restaurant. The food was very good and quite delicious. The service on the other hand left a bit to be desired. I sat at a table for an extended length of time before being served any beverage including water. Then I had to wait an extended amount of time for somebody to come and take an order. Maybe it was an anomaly I will try it again because the food was good."}
{"text":"Happy hour here was decent.. the only thing I have to knock off couple of stars is their service.. our waiter we got here kept forgetting things.. and I understand that we had different checks but he kept getting he bills wrong on everyone's .. he will take one order then take off and not even ask if anyone else needed anything.."}
{"text":"Happy Hour pricing is great! Service is better than ok and the place is clean upbeat and fun! Try the Ty Ku coconut!"}
{"text":"We just left Pure Sushi a few minutes ago after a bad experience.  In our opinion, the sushi and other bites were awful.  The sushi rice was horribly overcooked, the rolls were tasteless (if you can even imagine that!) and the asian style pork ribs were sugary, rubbery messes.  We tasted each item, which was all brought to our table all at the same time, with no thought as to coursing it out, and each bite left us disappointed.  While we had an entire table of food, the manager saw me holding out my credit card.  He came over and took the card.  He did not ask about the full table of food that we obviously had not and were not eating.  Our waitress came over after our card was run, and we paid the bill in full ($139) plus a nice tip ($28).  The waitress was very nice and the fact that the food was terrible was not her fault.  We sat for some period of time while we finished our Saki, thinking the manager at some point would at least come over to discuss our thoughts and comments.  But he never did.  When we left, we saw him standing sheepishly back by the kitchen.  Whomever owns this place should be very concerned about a manager who failed to evaluate the situation and try to at least listen.  This left us with no choice but to post this online.  At the end of the day, we really felt that the food was bad.  We will tell everyone we know to avoid Pure Sushi based on our experience.  On a final note, we are experienced diners, having traveled extensively and eaten at many of the world's 3 Michelin starred restaurants.  We admittedly have high standards.  Unfortunately, Pure Sushi is pure nonsense."}
{"text":"This place is hands down some of the best sushi I have had in Phoenix. The staff is so welcoming and friendly. It is truly my favorite restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"Nice sushi place with a bar. They have great service. The sushi is not the best but is good."}
{"text":"One of the best Happy Hour's in town. Unbelievable price deals on food and drink. Thank you for making it affordable. The bar tender is amazing as well. Understands that individuals sit at the bar for Happy Hour because they do not want to be alone. Thank you for being fun and inviting and engaging the customers among each other in an honest natural way."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. It's a little pricey. 7 bucks for 2 pieces of tuna nigiri might be the most i've ever paid. That being said, i'm coming back. This may have been the best sushi i've had in phoenix. Even the edamame was outstanding. The fish (tuna, scallop and unagi) was near perfect and the hokey poke roll was on point. I dont mind paying a little more for quality and i will def be dining here again.1"}
{"text":"Sushi was average, staff was nice, although it seemed there was confusion about who was handling our table."}
{"text":"Seriously how is this place under 5 stars?! This is my first time here and the first two people that I interacted with were fabulous, hilarious, and friendly (Greg,Abi). Then I met the rest of the crew while having a creme beer and the vibe is just awesome! Oh and the food...get the Poke!"}
{"text":"We walked into this place on a Sunday afternoon, and I was impressed by the set up, looked fancy, yet chic.

We were quickly greeted by a chef, and taken to our table; they have tables, booths, high bar tables, it's nice.

We were given a Happy Hour menu (yay), a dinner menu, and a sheet to mark our selections.

After that, our waitress came to meet us w/ a pitcher of water in her hand ready to fill up our cups, NICE! She was really nice, and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.

The menu has a great selection, and the prices will NOT break your wallet, they had simple rolls for $3, $4, dollars and some specialty rolls for $7-7-9 dollars in their Happy Hour Menu. Their sake bombers are $8, and they come with a large beer and a large sake. 

We took a few minutes to look at the menu, we we decided to stick to the Happy Hour selection; we order their fried calamari and the ahi avocado poke for appetizers, and for sushi rolls, we chose a spicy tuna, rainbow roll, baked lobster and the fire dragon. We also order 2 sake bombers.

The appetizers came out first, both were really good, I loved the ahi poke, the calamari was \"ok\", but the sauce they served it with was NASTY, I just ate the calamari w/ some lime and soy sauce instead.

When the rolls came, I was impressed by the size, they were actually big, filled w/ meat, and they all tasted delicious.

Our waitress kept check on on us to make sure we were taken care of, she was great.

At the end, our bill came out to less than $60.00, and we had some sushi left over! 

If you go during Happy Hour, definitley take advantage of it. I am looking forward to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap Happy Hour and decent sushi, then this is your spot.  When we visited it wasn't too busy and the service was great.  I was really hoping the sushi was better."}
{"text":"LOVE IT

Came here during my 1 hour lunch break, it was not crowded at all. They have great lunch specials (bentos and sushi combos). They are large portioned and the price is very reasonable. I ordered the sea bass bento ($15). It came with ~5oz (?) moist sea bass, salad, tempura with shrimp, and rice. I also ordered a side a salmon sashimi ($10). Honestly, the bento alone was good enough, I just couldn't keep myself from ordering some sushi too. The sashimi pieces were fresh and pretty thick. I love that they didn't give me small, thin pieces. But $2 a piece is pretty steep for me. Service was fast and helpful. I will have to come back for their happy hour menu next time.

Note: 
- If you return within 7 days with you receipt you get a discount on your next visit :) 
- also theres a wall/usb charger at every booth and sushi bar seat !!

{"text":"This wasn't our first time here (over 10 times) and portions are getting smaller... much smaller than their competitors!

Their version of Lollipop rolls include the imitation crab mix. Gross!!

Another lollipop roll had a \"citrus sauce\" but looked like water and rolls had little flavor. We all agree we think the fish was previously frozen. 

Must have new management and cutting back on quality."}
{"text":"Straight and forward here.  When we walked in she immediately took us to a table. She had a bad vibe. My girlfriend and I wanted a booth and the hostess said it was reserved. I wanted to make sure if it was, she walked off in a hissy fit and asked the girls in the front if the booth was reserved. She shook her head and she looked at us and said \"oh I guess it's not reserves after all\" totally was not happy working tonight but not my fault. 
I had the vegetable rolls. Ehhh it was okay. I wasn't that satisfied with my entrée."}
{"text":"Amazeballs. I had two rolls: caterpillar and salmon. I loved the Elsa Malbec with the rich, flavorful sushi. Our server was sweet and smart simultaneously, a rare combination. The atmosphere rocks. You just HAVE TO try this place!"}
{"text":"We just went there for the first time. The food was great and the happy hour prices were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, good service, clean nice place!!! Good for sushi and hot dishes, delicious cocktails!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start... I came in with a friend for happy hour. I was happy to see their happy hour is fairly diverse, with many food and drink options. Additionally, their happy hour prices are exceedingly cheap. Unfortunately, the food and drinks are not also exceedingly good. I had the basil lemonade drink... it was almost undrinkable. This thing was so strong (but not in a good way) and lacked any real flavor of lemon or basil.... it was hard to finish. I tried a few different rolls, which all were huge in girth making them difficult to eat and just ok in flavor. We also tried the gyoza (from frozen)... not good, the calamari (probably also from frozen)... not good, and the pork sliders (actually fairly tasty). Despite the good price, I don't see a reason to return."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Cocktails are delicious and happy hour is 7 days a week! Overall, it's very well the best sushi place in the area. Ask about their sushi special of the day. Prices can be steep but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! They have a great happy hour and the food and drinks are great too. Our favorite roll is the shrimp dynamite and we also love the miso butter edamame. This spot is a great uptown option for any occasion."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and am always satisfied.  They spent a bunch of money on the interior and it's very nice although not to my taste.  The sushi is excellent, but a bit pricey.  They have an outstanding happy hour when you can taste a lot of their more expensive items at a great price."}
{"text":"This place is so good and the service is great here!!!! Everyone is so kind and it's normally always quiet!!! Even around 4-5pm, so great!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food! Had some new to me, that I loved! Server was relatable and efficient."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite sushi place in the greater PHX area. 

We were greeted and seated quickly. The food came out lightning fast. The food quality and flavor was excellent. 

Ambience was ok -- noise level was pretty loud, but it was packed, and there was a table of four women behind us who were cackling at such an improbable volume that we realized the true noise level of the restaurant once they finally left. 

Prices are a little on the high side, but you get what you pay for. 

The service was just fair. The staff was not particularly friendly. As the plates of appetizers & finished sushi piled up, no one who worked there (including our server) felt it was a good idea to clear the table. It got kind of embarrassing for a while before our server finally decided she would lower herself to that of a busgirl. Not a deal-breaker, but no question the staff would benefit from more training and an attitude adjustment.

Do get the Asian BBQ ribs. Best we've ever had!"}
{"text":"I wish I liked the sushi more as I really wanted to. We tried 4 different rolls. My biggest issue is there was very little fish and each roll had far too much over-powering sauce. I like sushi for the fresh ingredients. I feel like all the sauce was hiding something from me. For the price I would try somewhere else nearby like Hanna (missoiri and 7th ave) or Yama (central south of camelback). You get much better fish for a lower price."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is deeelicious! There isn't one thing I have ordered I didn't enjoy.  I like the atmosphere and décor of the restaurant.  I would definitely recommend it and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi in the Northern Central area of Phoenix. I believe this is their second or third location. Good fresh fish nice specialty rolls full bar attentive friendly staff that serves you with a smile. Not too many other sushi place is right in this neighborhood. They have a daily happy hour. The building is brand new and they did a great job on the decor. Nice friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I think it's got great cocktails, and the sushi is fantastic. #1 - get the edamame with miso butter (if you like spicy food) - it is ahhh-mazing!
I also highly recommend the Ahi & Avocado Poke (appetizer) - the texture is made more interesting with the taro chips & the ahi is super fresh. Also had the Hamachi wheel - YES YES YES!  Definitely get the hoke poke roll, and the Loch Ness roll CANNOT be missed. Lots of other great rolls as well. Have never been disappointed in a visit to PURE! And a central Phoenix location too. A+++"}
{"text":"Super fresh! Not cheap, but worth it! Best roll is easily the Lochness...I dream of it sometimes. Same selection is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! 

Lunch and happy hour are amazing deals!
My favorite thing to order is lunch chirashi bowl or chicken katsu! 
Happy hour they have$3 salmon and tuna rolls!!!!!

If you have never been, you need to go now! Stop reading this review and go now! Food is fresh good and cheap! Like this comment if you feel the same way!"}
{"text":"Server:  1 star.

 young Asian girl.  She was sort of clueless.  She did not understand my clearly spoken order. I even ordered an item, she wrote it down. Then, like 10 minutes later she returns to the table to ask \"Did you want that item?\"  I said, yes, I had ordered it with you and you wrote it down.  She never came back to check on us.  The other wait staff filled drinks and such.  She didn't know if a bowl of rice came with entrees or orders.

Menu:  3 stars

The $25 sashimi plate does NOT even come with a 25 cent bowl of rice. This is unheard of in Japanese restaurants. They want to nickel and dime you.  Rice should come included with the sashimi plate. The sashimi was okay. The yellow tail tuna smelled fishy, but I didn't get food poisoning. 

I got the hamachi kama (yellowtail). It was okay. It also did not come with a simple, low cost bowl of rice. Nickel and dimed again.  It tasted okay.  

Atmosphere:  2 stars

Extremely loud inside. Horrible acoustics design, sound just bounces off of everything.  They had no booths available which was odd.  

Overall:  2.5 stars.

Likely won't return here.  Bill for my 2 items ended up being $52 with tax and tip.  Much higher priced than most Japanese restaurants. Paying for the attempted trendiness of the place, the interior decorating, etc."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good, prices were a little high but overall would definitely come again! 
I got the WTF roll and added mango and it was super yum!"}
{"text":"I love Pure Sushi and also come for the Lobster Spring rolls. Tonight I went in and after a really rough day the waitress Kim was just so awesome and wonderful. Its amazing to know there are still kind people in the world and she is one of them & her service is great. The food is always awesome and I just wanted to say thank you for being a wonderful establishment"}
{"text":"I had the Loch Ness roll, mouth watery goodness. So much flavor in a small bite. One of the best rolls I've had. The joint itself is nice, good location. The server was helpful and friendly. All in all great place, will be returning to try more."}
{"text":"A gorgeous sushi restaurant with beautiful decor and amazingly friendly staff. A shout out to Ashley, my waitress, for her help with the menu selection. Her cheerfulness was a welcoming.  My favorite entree is the sashimi & sushi lunch special. For only $15, I got 9 thick slices of sashimi, and 5 delicious nigiri. A miso soup with yummy mushrooms was also included with this order. It was a quick lunch for me, and I must say I like it here. I'm definitely coming back to try more of their delicious food when I have more time. Bon Appetit everyone!!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for a baseball game, we yelped a place to eat at 9:00 at night. Bars seemed to be just about the  only option until we saw this place so we tried it. The service started a little slow; we seated ourselves since no one was around and I was just about to get up and find my own menu when someone finally came to greet us and give us menus. From this point, everything was great!!! Service was great and fast. Sushi was fresh and delicious! The decor was so nice and relaxing. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Totally $$$$$ but worth it. Nice modern place. Salmon was delicious, a friend got it as she hates raw. I had the dynamite shrimp and it as soooooooooo!!! Good ! Also had the WTF roll and again my taste buds had a party.  The drinks were delicious! Tasted the cucumber martini and it made me feel fun and flirty."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok, not a bad place to hang if you dont mind just ok sushi cause the bar drinks are great and it has awesome wait staff that were very attentive and responsive. I can imagine the food taking a back seat if you were just out to have a good time but I cannot lie and say the food was great, the overall dining was though if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"Ambience: 4 [loud]; Food: 5, Service 5. Stars that is. The food is a fresh twist on Japanese cuisine. We were a party of four and the service was as good as can be."}
