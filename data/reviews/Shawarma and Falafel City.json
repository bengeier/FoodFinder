{"text":"Arriving in town at 10pm after a delayed flight, this was one of only a few places still open on a Sunday night. And man was it good. Make sure to get the garlic sauce in the wrap and then a side of tzatziki sauce to go with the fries. It's exactly the kind of meal you want when you're: 1. tired and hungry, 2. very drunk, or 3. very hungover. I'll gladly have it all 3 ways."}
{"text":"Used to be very good... But now just OK.
I think the owner's used to work behind the counter alot... But now it appears to be some hired help.... Cheaping out on the meat now.... And they don't heat it up on the flat top."}
{"text":"I wandered in for the first time not that long ago and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  I had the beef salad, and it was HUGE, delicious and very satisfying.  Glad to find another awesome place in the neighbourhood.  I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I probably should have reviewed this after my first visit. That falafel was really different, tasted really good, unlike most other falafels I've had. One trick they have is crumbling the falafel up and spreading it around a bit in the wrap. Another is putting the whole thing in a panini grill for a couple minutes. They also double-wrap their ingredients with a small inner pita and a large thinner wrap. 

By the third time around though, the service is still fine and the decor is pleasant and the falafel is great, but it just didn't knock me out. Probably one of best falafels I've ever had, but I'm getting used to it by now."}
{"text":"Open until 4 am Falafel City is more than just a really excellent name. 

If you like shawarma, falafel, or anything related, the guys at Falafel City are friendly, prompt and ready to offer you a selection of vegetables for your wrap or sandwich that would put most sandwich places to shame.

Focused on authentic flavours, Falafel City is a great place to grab a wrap for the park, stumble into after a night out on Kensington Road, or pick up a pear soda.

Much better than greasy pizza after the bar, try Falafel City.

{"text":"Really friendly and good service. I had the donair which was really good although they forgot the sauce :( I think they were just swamped. But I would recommend the place. It's very authentic."}
{"text":"I really liked this shawarma place. It's unique in that it is doubley wrapped - once in a pita and second in a home made bread. I've been back twice since I first found it. I like that it gives you the option of beef and lamb, not a lot of restaurants do it and they hand make their falafels. I don't recommend getting the salad, it's a sad mix of lettuce and toppings. Their shawarmas are huge by the way if you order a large. Definitely enough for a meal. They also have unique beverages too. Try it out!"}
{"text":"After an awesome night with friends, we decided to cap off our evening with Falafels and Shawarma. So, why not head to a place with Falafel and Shawarma already in their name? Sold.

Food here is made quickly and is fairly affordable, they've also got a range of things to try, like non alcoholic apple beer. If you want a wrap the size of a 14 month old, invest in their jumbo wrap with everything. The pita they put it in isn't big enough, so they secure it in what looks like a pita/crepe hybrid.

I opted for their Veggie Falafel platter. My heart was won over when I saw the guy, rather than take out a container of ready-made balls and stick a handful in the microwave, took out a container and made each Falafel by hand before putting them in the deep fryer. The platter also comes with Hummus, Tabbouleh, a green salad, Garlic Potatoes and Rice. Hello, food coma. While I waited, I read the walls that had all the ingredients for the Falafels written, complete with instructions on how to properly shape and fry them. Love.

It wasn't the best Falafel I've ever had, but it was delicious and the perfect thing after a night of dancing until my feet fell off."}
{"text":"ive always had a great shawarma large and small. what kind of retard goes to a shawerma shop to order seafood or hippie food? obviously the less popular items would be out of stock and they would rather take normal orders of normal people than wait around for you to make up your mind. chicken, beef or lamb?

ive never seen staff without transparent plastic gloves so hygene is paramount."}
{"text":"I discovered Sharwarma and Falafel City during one of my lonesome but pleasant Kensington strolls. I walked by the sign and saw \"Falafel City\" and recalled the one time I saw \"Falafel Hood\". I thought to myself \"Self. There is no way you are eating at an establishment that has 'Hood' in it's name\" and walked on. The month or so later I drove by a place called \"Falafel District\" and drove on because I didn't care.But then JUST around last January when I was driving out of town I SWORE I saw a place called \"Falafel Village\". So after seeing Falafel city I decided to put a stop to this absurdity and marched in. 

Much to my surprise it was a relaxed environment with a neat cafe style dining room. They had wifi and a television screen that appeased me because it was showing a classic episode of Iron Chef and became INSTANTLY MUUUUUNGGGRRRYYY . I forgot my beef as soon as the Gentlemen behind the counter greeted me like I was a pub regular. Small talk ensued and soon I ended up ordering a Falafel.

Now I'm not a Falafel expert in that I know every step there is to making this glorious street food, at least on a level like some coffee connesiuers who go BANANAS the moment a server gives them drip coffee, but I noticed a few things that made Shawarma and Falafel City unique from most places. They fried your falafels on the spot! Wow did it make the difference, nothing like the texture of oily hot falafel adding extra MMMMMMMMMGOODNEZZZZ to your wrap. They also piled on a generous helping of fresh veggies and herbs. When it came to sauces they played the \"say when!\" game. Me likes a lot of garlic sauce and hot sauce on mine. Me also likes the painful rejection of women who come within my proximity after having consumed Falafel wraps.

The price was reasonable. For 7 bucks you can get a medium sized wrap which can either be a Falafel, Shawarma, or a Donair or if you're feeling frisky ALL of the MEAT (Yes I know Falafel isn't made out of meat). For 10 bucks you can get a bigger wrap. But like I said, these folks love to pack it down and make sure you're biting into a BRICK.

Oh you best believe I'll be back!

But seriously stop attaching settlements after \"Falafel\" as names. It ends with \"city\". What's next? Falafel Metropolis? Or....FALAFELOPOLIS!! o_O"}
{"text":"Came here for a very late snack. They have a very big selection of food options and the donairs are great. They have chicken wings, and mozzarella sticks too. Friendly staff as well. If you're ever hankering for a snack or a big meal, i recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Deliciously spiced Kafta, mounds of other Mediterranean and they're open until...4am?! What struck me about Shawarma and Falafel City is they're clean, friendly and tasty enough that they you definitely don't need to limit them to late-night, post-pub, drunk-munchy binge eating. Lunch, dinner, snack, it's all cool!  In case the name wasn't a big enough giveaway, you also might be surprised to learn that they do in fact sell shawarma and falafel. I haven't had either of those yet, but I'm excited to go back and try them out!

I stopped in for an early lunch and bypassed the usual shawarma suspects for one of their Kafta beef burgers. If you're not too sure what kafta is... well heck I'm not going into it but they have a great description posted on the wall. Read up, it's fun! 7 minutes later when your burger arrives (it takes a wee bit of time since they cook it fresh) you'll be a well versed connoisseur in the world of kafta and you'll be ready to take you first perfectly spiced (\"10 spices to be exact\" as informed by their wall) bite. 

They have 3 sizes of shawarma ending in \"humongous\" or \"gigantic\", or something like that. I can't remember the adjective they use, but given the large amount of food I received for $8, I can't help but wonder what kind of monster wrap $15 would could buy me. Morbid curiosity will get the best of me soon enough and I'll be updating this review while fighting a shawarma coma, yelling \"what have I done?!\"  ...while loving every second of that.

Until that time, I'm more than happy to recommend the Kafta burger, but I feel like my future visits will be for the wraps and plates."}
{"text":"hip, friendly dudes and delicious fresh food! i'm definitely coming back when i'm in town. ayo delicious, mang."}
{"text":"Disaster-had to just leave.  My daughter ordered the fish sandwich and the female worker said they were out of both buns and sub sandwich bread. My husband then ordered the bean salad and she said she had to go in the back to see if they had any more. We were ready to start ordering other items and the man working there just looked right passed us to two men that walked in and took their order. Then another man walked in and that worker asked him what he wanted and seeing us all in front of him, the man asked if we had all ordered and I said \"No, we haven't ordered yet\" and the worker looked right at me and then turned back to the new customer and just took his order. We just decided to leave. On our way out we saw the girl was coming back empty handed, so they apparently didn't have the salad either! Go to Shawarma Station in Kensington instead, they've always given us excellent, super-friendly service and the food is great."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 2 times now and I really enjoy it because both times I have gone has been really late at night after a night on the town I guess I should say. I like this place because it is open until an unusual time around 4:00am so it is perfect and it is always busy with people like myself who are needing food after a night out, taxi drivers go here a lot when they need a break or a snack, I have seen people who are just getting off work go here or people who are just starting work go here to for night shift or early morning shifts, etc. 
The quality is very good for price and the quantity is very good for price."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it.   The shwarama was heating fresh, the falafels are freshly deep fried, the veggies look enticingly fresh, A-1 freshness all around.  The falafels are meh

If you are getting the lamb or beef they will pull it out of a backroom after slaughgtering a cow/sheep on teh premsesis afaik.  LOL jk, it could be sitting there for a while, so i'd stay away from the backroom meats..

Fresh yoh!"}
{"text":"If you see this place,  Keep walking.   Run even.   Run fast and far away.   It's gross.   This gives shawarma a bad name.   If you think this is delicIous you need to get your tastebuds checked maybe even a tounge scraped .   Nothing fresh or appetizing about it.  
To sum it up with one word -  Barf-o-la.

Oh.  I've also never had my potatoes crushed up in front of my eyes with the workers fingers.   Try a fork next time and a plate.   Disgusted from the start."}
{"text":"Yum! These people really know how to make this food. It was delicious. I did the falafel shawarma regular size and it was huge. hubby did I the double donair 12\" and it was so much food. His was my favorite- it was really good. Kids split the chicken fingers with fries and it was still too much food. We loved it. Their white dipping sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"I like their veggie falafel plate. They're friendly and it's bright and clean in here. Usually quick. They have hot potatoes they let stew and they're quite good. They're usually playing some middle eastern (I'm gonna guess Egyptian) music which is cheery."}
{"text":"Easily best donair shop in the city! Clean respectful friendly staff always ready to serve even until 4 am! This was my atop of choice when u worked in the bars downtown must check it out if you visit Calgary you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"In my opinion , it's the best chicken shawarma in the city.  They use the real pita for the wrap (I believe it's called sagh).Excellent service and they often have Just For Laughs Gags on the TV!"}
{"text":"Had a large falafel.  Falafel was dry and reheated in a microwave!  Should have been fried fresh.  Pita was dry.  Iceburg lettuce in middle eastern food, really?  Where is the tabouli or parsley.  pretty mediocre food."}
{"text":"'Extra large beef, triple meat please!' is something I'll ask for someday, if I ever get ridiculously hangry. The extra large beef shawarma actually extends from one corner of the tray to the other.

I come here often and not once was the shawarma poorly wrapped. The only time it got messy was when I ordered a large beef, triple meat. The place is always clean. The guys behind counter are genuine. I love the spice that they put in the beef and the mango curry sauce, if it's available. And they don't cheap out on the beef!

What's to not like about this place?"}
{"text":"These guys were at a 'Small Business Expo' in Sunnyside last weekend that my mom was taking part in. She had rented a table for half a day and I decided to pop in for a visit and check out the booths. She mentioned there was shawarma there, and that it smelled delicious, but never having liked shawarma in the past, I was disinterested. However, when I arrived - IT DID SMELL DELICIOUS. It looked like everyone was eating it, and I was starving, so we decided to grab a bite. I had the beef and my mom had the chicken, and I have to admit it was really, really good. The guys were super friendly and efficient, cranking out tons of food (my mom commented that they were the only ones making money that day haha). Changed my opinion on shawarma for sure! Its definitely not something to eat on a date (I seriously couldn't get the taste of onions and the sauce out of my mouth but was SO good). I cant comment on the actual restaurant, since I've never been there, but after trying it for lunch I will definitely check it out. My boyfriend will be thrilled as he is always trying to get me to go for shawarma with him! Cant wait to try some of the other things they have to offer."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and given the previous reviews was rather disappointed.  

The donair platter I ordered was fairly bland with the veggies all rather mushy & not very fresh and the rice had an odd metallic taste.  My GF ordered a chicken wrap that was OK but by no means special.  Probably the biggest shock was that the zucchini sticks and samosas aren't made in house.  Both pre-fabbed like what you would find at costco.

On the positive yes they are friendly."}
{"text":"I went there because the restaurant I was looking for was closed, and it was sunday at 2pm... And everybody just wanted to eat.. I have to say I was positively surprised with Excellent service and Delicious shawarmas!!.. I had the beef and lamb and also ordered the falafel  and it was great... I have nothing but good things to say about this place!!.."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh!! I am in love!!

I had the mixed meat shawarma. The meat was seasoned to perfection. Make sure you get all this sauces. Ask for everything on it!! My mom had the Chicken Twook and that was so good too!

This was my first time having Egyptian food and I'm sold. This is my second time in Canada and my buddy who's from here wanted to show me this place. It's looks like I've found my Canadian food spotPlease go here! You won't regret it!"}
