{"text":"Can't speak about the food because wait staff didn't want to help me. I must have asked 3-4 people for a menu before being told it'll be 20 minutes which could turn to 30 - 40 minutes because the food is made fresh. I like sassy, but I can do without the attitude."}
{"text":"Got the buffalo wings and saw the celery sticks still had dirt on them. Asked the waiter for more celery after pointing out the dirt to him and got celery with even more dirt on them and sent those immediately back. He stated: that's all we've got. This could have been easily fixed with an extra rinse with water. Do you know how many parasites can be passed on through dirt (manure)? I felt bad for the guy eating the salad next to me. And the waiter did not take anything off the bill."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow. Order was incorrect when it finally arrived. Bad Daddy's is exactly that.....BAD."}
{"text":"We just flew back from Denver tired and hungry . We had great food !!! Also our server was awesome Aubry took such good care of us and was so sweet!! She gets 5 stars herself !!!!"}
{"text":"Good new addition with better variety of \"comfort\" food. It seems like the menu is catered to faster to prepare items so that they can get to the table faster: important to me since CLT has so many tight connections."}
{"text":"Took 17 minutes to get a beer at the bar, while 3 waiters chatted next to the bar, didn't try the food took so long to get my drink I was afraid to order food and be able to catch my flight."}
{"text":"Was not expecting such a great breakfast early the morning of New Year's Eve, but that's just what we got here. I had the Mike's Scramble and my wife had the Popeye's Scramble. Seasoned well, a little spicy, really good bacon, and soft thick toast. Add the attentive service and our day started wonderfully!"}
{"text":"On this rating, I'm ignoring mistakes on the order (wrong kind of fries, mix-up on the sauce).  But in their favor it was crazy busy, and the server was hustling to keep people happy.  Good job warning of a long wait for food.  Excellent speed on drinks while waiting.  And the mushroom burger was excellent.  Fries were unremarkable, but the bbq aioli with them was very good.  (I'd asked for sweet potato fries with no aioli, but no biggie.)"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings from Bad Daddys during a layover in Charlotte and didn't plan accordingly. After waiting for 10 minutes, I had to leave the restaurant to catch my flight. The manager made sure I got my wings; a flight attendant brought them to my seat care of Bad Daddy's. They were some of the best wings I've ever had. Thank you! As a regular business traveler, I highly recommend the chicken wings, beer selection, and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken burger very basic  And way over priced .regardless of price this was disappointing that any one can come up with this lame sandwich with Cheap bread of white slices and a 4 0z breast with one slice of lettuce and ham.    I just remember. Just like school Cafeteria food."}
{"text":"This restaurant gave my boyfriend food poisoning. He has been horribly sick and unable to eat anything since we ate there on Tuesday, two days ago. Thanks for ruining our vacation with your overpriced burgers, Bad Daddy's!! I am absolutely reporting them to the Charotte health department ASAP. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Just okay. 3 significant flaws.   I fix a mean burger, and I'm picky about where I go to eat one, so I rarely try a new (to me) burger joint.   The 3 main flaws: 1. Red onion. Should be yellow. They are sweeter, have more flavor and are smoother (red onions are not smooth).  2. Beef was too lean. Should be no leaner than 85/15.  Makes a burger too dry. 3. Funky pickles. Just use hamburger dills. The pickles here are weirdly spiced. Burgers are supposed to be simple and basic. No need for strange tasting pickles.  Whole wheat bun was outstanding.   The potato chips were very good.  Service was a little slow but about normal for an airport eatery.   The classic rock music was enjoyable in an era where most public music is repetitive and tasteless."}
{"text":"Breakfast Burger served with deep fried potatoes, bacon, ham, cheese.  Artery blocker special! Medium burger arrived well done, oh well, time to catch my flight.  Nice views of Tarmac. No place to charge phone :("}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is pretty good. Especially amongst the other places in the airport. I just had fries and fried pickles but everyone else seemed to be enjoying their food. The service is really quick so if youre looking to grab something and only have 30 mins they can make it work for sure.   Service is ok. Some of the restaurants in the airport use a table side call button you can press to call the waiter. I find it doesnt really improve service compared to other restaurants. They wait by committee so you just gotta ask them for stuff as they walk by otherwise you'll be waiting a while for your waiter/waitress to come back around."}
{"text":"Came here during our layover with the partner. And boy were we hungry. So much so I didn't even take pictures of our meals. My partner got the bacon on steroids burger and I got a create-your-own burger with wheat bun, garlic mayo, brie and white cheddar cheese with regular patty. Side of fries for both. Not the best, not the worst, we were mostly kissy SO hungry. But we enjoyed it. Service was decent. Next time we're starved and craving for a burger at the Charlotte airport, we'll stop here.  (93% sanitation grade)"}
{"text":"Came to Bad Daddy's while waiting for a flight at the Charlotte airport. I ordered at the quick eats (to-go) line which was quite convenient, although I did have to wait a minute or two to get someone to take my order. I ordered a side salad and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The salad was one of the most miserable salads I have ever seen. The taste was fine though. The buffalo chicken sandwich was too salty and came with too much blue cheese. Quite a subpar dining experience"}
