{"text":"I have tried this place several times. Sadly, the only thing I have ever enjoyed here was the Round Salad. The last time I went I was extremely hesitant because of previous visits, however, I figured one more time couldn't hurt. I was so wrong. The she crab soup was decent but barely warm, my chicken was way overcooked, and a person in our group of 8 found a large piece of plastic in his jambalaya. The service was decent so I cant fault her for the over hour wait for the food. I definitely will not be going back. The manager came over (maybe the owner?) on a Saturday night with a toboggan on his head, which I found a little odd for a place that is supposed to be a little more \"upscale\". (Especially with the price point) I wish I could say maybe it was an \"off night\" but with the two previous experiences I don't think that is the case."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It fills a much needed gap in Gastonia cuisine.  I like the fondu appetizer with fresh fruit, bread, broccoli and carrots.  The specials are always interesting.  Nice place for a date but it can be a little loud.  I recommend it for Gaston County folk."}
{"text":"I haven't actually had any of the entrees or main dishes, only the Sunday brunch buffet. So as for everything on the menu, I really can't speak of it.  We went last week for Sunday brunch. It was an okay experience service-wise: our waitress was friendly enough, but for it being fairly slow, our cups were definitely not being filled like they should have been. Also as far as ordering food it was incredibly slow for what we got, but I'll get to that later.  The buffet is medium sized with a section for salads, then a sort of soul food selection including fried chicken, Mac and cheese, BBQ, wings, potatoes, etc. All the meats were good, but the mac and cheese was very bland and dry. Actually, none of the sides were really anything to talk about. There was an option for ordering pancakes and French toast, which we got, but it literally took forever which I couldn't understand...it's literally a piece of bread dipped in egg and then fried. By the time it came, we didn't even want it anymore.   Overall the food was okay and the price was alright, but I wish there was more variety in the food, especially breakfast items on the buffet. I'd also really like to see some fresh fruit since it is a brunch."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. We chose to go to The Round Bistro based on the strong reviews we read (even though the poor reviews were a bit concerning), but at best this place was only mediocre. The appetizer (vegetable bruschetta) was excellent, but my son's Caesar salad was deconstructed, and his main course (pork tenderloin) was very good, but the asparagus was old. My husband and I both got dinner salads with grilled chicken, but the chicken tasted and looked more like it was boiled, and there were several pieces of lettuce that should have been discarded. That's always a sign of poor quality. We were excited about trying a new place hoping for something really special, but this truly missed the mark."}
{"text":"Had the hot ham and pimento cheese wrap.  The breading on the wrap was delicious, service is always great and the drinks are modern and fresh.  Highly recommend this Bistro."}
{"text":"We have been members of Round Bistro BOGO on Monday's program for two years taking dinner there almost every Monday evening. We find it to be a good deal at the BOGO price if you stick to the monthly specials and chicken dishes however ordering steak meals has been inconsistent. On of our favorites, Pork Tenderloin, was actually taken off the menu due to customer complaints despite how easy it is to prepare at home. The owner used to take Monday off but has started to work that day which has improved the quality of the meals immensely."}
{"text":"Love the place! Great service, great food, and a.fun place to hang out with friends. The owners and staff make you feel comfortable and welcome."}
{"text":"Best spot in Gastonia. Try the she crab soup! The menu never gets old since they have regional specials every month. NOLA month is always a fav. Great beer on tap- including red oak. Heather, the bartender, is the best."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite hangout! The food is great and I love it when they do the monthly regional favorites...Chef Jack and his staff goes out of their way to make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Never done a review but my food was totally worth it-so good and the owner/chef is super knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"I have been numerous times in the short time The Round has been open and each and every time the food has been delicious (especially the she crab soup and the fried asparagus!), the service top notch, and just a great inviting atmosphere. I saw a review about being overpriced for this area and had to laugh...it is overpriced if you are comparing it to chili's, oh charlies, applebees and the like that is available around here, but then again you get what you pay for! So, if you want to spend a few dollars less on an entree in Gastonia, enjoy the chain restaurants, but I'll gladly pay the small difference in price to enjoy the huge difference in quality and taste! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Slow service and average food. Menu had a lot of choices, but nothing tastes spectacular. Closes at 11pm, but we were kicked out at 10 on a Saturday night because we were the only table and the bartender wanted to leave."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to the area from Charlotte. We are already missing the wonderful restaurant were used to live near. So far most of Gastonia is fast food, chain restaurants, or other generally unhealthy options. It was a nice change of pace finding Round Bistro. The food is good and fresh. I got the Crab Cake stuffed Portabella and my wife got the Cilantro Lime Chicken. My wife liked her entree but mine was fantastic! We both got rice as sides which was ok, her mixed veggies were cooked well, however my mash potatoes were bland. I wasn't too upset because I could tell they were homemade, they just needed a bit of butter and seasoning.  The atmosphere is nice, well lit, clean and modern. The prices average $10-15 a plate. Our sever was great too! Very attentive and good suggestions. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wouldn't buy their food for the dog I don't have.  Motezerlla ball was cold in the middle and obviously cooked earlier in the day. The lettuce was Brown and wilted and saturated in dressing. The chicken parm was swimming in a bowl of crushed whole tomatoes that lacked flavor. I couldn't even eat the main dish. Please save your money and eat at the sonic above them. At least you'll be paying medocre prices for their food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last Friday and the food was great.  We took the direction of a previous reviewer and tried the salmon mousse appetizer and the fried banana desert, both delicious.  My entree was Chardonnay chicken and my husband tried the shrimp marinara, and we were very happy with our selections.  The chicken came with wonderful, real mashed potatoes and perfectly grilled asparagus. The only negative comment I would have is that the space is very noisy and has an echo.  I mentioned this to one of the owners, Aaron, and he told me that they were aware of the problem and were in the process of rectifying it.  The booth seating seemed less noisy than one of the center tables, and our evening was enjoyable.  We will return."}
{"text":"Build your own burger was amazing. Great service and quality food. I will come again!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Round Bistro last night for dinner.  4 adults and a 1 year old.  When we arrived there was ample seating, but it began to fill up as the live music at 8pm was approaching.    The food--  We ordered the She Crab Soup appetizer and it was excellent.  You could taste the sherry, which is a must for my eastern shore family background.  There wasn't any lump crab meat in it aside from the garnish, but that did not deter from the taste.   We all got salads with our entrees.  I tried the Cesar.  It was \"fancy restaurant\" take on a Cesar.  Whole leaves from a heart of romaine, some broken bagel chips, and very thin Cesar dressing.  The house made dressing did taste fine-I don't really remember it at the moment so it couldn't have been too good.  The bagel chips were a nice change from huge, hard croutons that explode when you try to spear them.  The romaine looked like it was just ripped off the head as the ends were jagged, contained part of the root, and had way too much of that white, inedible stem part that has no green part attached.  My parents ordered the the Round Salad.  I don't know about how the salad was, but my father's blue cheese dressing tasted nothing like blue cheese dressing.  It tasted much like a southern pasta salad dressing-very vinegar-e and mayo-e.   I ordered the Chicken Chardonnay which comes with mashed potatoes, and I chose grilled asparagus as my side.  The chicken was ok.  It was 2 thin cut chicken breasts that had been pan sauteed and lightly covered in a light-on-flavor cream sauce and a few button mushroom slices.  The mashed potatoes were dry and had a far away hint of garlic-likely garlic powder.  They had a texture similar to boxed potatoes.  The grilled asparagus was good; it was fresh and had good flavor and doneness.  My husband had the Shrimp and Grits.  It was shrimp (tails still on-he hates that), sausage, pepper and onion medley in a red based sauce served over grits.  After picking off all his tails, which he complains about everywhere, he dove right in.  He loves spicy food.  I mean Carolina Reaper pepper sauce loves spicy food.  This was not spicy.  I am allergic to shrimp, so I don't know if shrimp and grits normally comes spicy.  This is just what he said.   My father got the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo.  It was the same shrimp, sausage, peppers and onions that was in the Shrimp and Grits with the addition of either grilled or bar-b-que'd chicken breast (I couldn't tell and didn't ask-see dinner attendees for explanation) and served over rice.  He didn't say much about it.   My mother ordered the Cilantro Lime Chicken and sauteed spinach.  Same thin cut, pan sauteed chicken breasts topped with pico.  She said it was a little spicy (she doesn't have the same Carolina Reaper taste for spicy like my husband), but she didn't complain, so I guess it was okay.  I tried her spinach and it had good flavor.   I agree with another reviewer that the kids menu has good selection and reasonably priced.  For my daughter, we ordered the grilled chicken which comes with sauteed vegetables .  The chicken was smaller and thicker than the adult portions was seasoned well (we did have to pick off the cracked pepper before my daughter ate it) and was moist-very important.  The sauteed veggies were thin zucchini slices, julienne carrots and thin slices of red pepper.  I am glad it wasn't the same broccoli, carrots and wild card item.  It didn't have much flavor; the zucchini was waterlogged, the carrots kind of plastic-e and we didn't even bother with the red pepper (my child only has 4 teeth and can't chew pepper skin).  They do have Kraft Cheese and Mac on the menu.  After seeing the vegetables, I would have rather to have gotten grilled chicken with a side of the mac and cheese.  I didn't ask, so it may be an option.    The Service--  Everything came out very fast.  The waitress and waiter (yes, we had 2 people helping us and never figured out who was our actual waiter or why we had 2) were very nice and attentive.  We ordered the soup and the kid's meal right after we got our drinks.  We had not yet finished our soups and the salads where there.  We had not yet finished our salads and our meals where there.  We had no room for all of the plates since we never had the whole table clear between courses.  This may be fine for some, but for us, when we go to a supposedly fancy restaurant we expect to have time between courses.  We felt rushed and for paying $150 for a dinner we shouldn't feel rushed.  We likely won't be back."}
{"text":"The location is in a strip mall. Inside lots of round mirrors on walls. Comfortable booths. The menu was good. I had she crab soup which was tasty. The crab was ground fine but the soup had good flavor except it was not hot enough. Soup should be hot in my book. I would have sent it back but I knew they would just probably nuke it. The flatbread pizza was good with ground mushrooms and cheese. The other thing that did bother be was  my waitress who was very nice and friendly kept calling me hon and honey and touching my shoulder. To familiar for me and her breath smelled like smoke which was a turn off. Please if you are going to smoke use a breath mint. As I don't live here and was just staying at a hotel to go to the airport I probably won't return but I would give it another try.  Mint"}
{"text":"I have been several times and generally enjoy the experience.  The decor is nice and the food is very good.  Food delivery is consistently slow- from the time the waitress takes your order till it is delivered.  The only thing I don't recommend is the fondue bowl- the cheese was not appetizing.  The best item is the beernanas for dessert.  The first time we got it, we were a little taken aback by the delivery- inside a simple paper bag, torn in half in front of us, with a dipping sauce to the side.  It is phenomenal! Sometimes we got eat there, just to round out our meal with the beernanas."}
{"text":"Very good food for a late lunch. Service was a little slow. The salmon and baked penne lunch entrees were excellent!"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon in hopes we'd find a new favorite local spot. Wrong! There was no hostess at the door so had to wait a few minutes. Then it took 20 minutes. No lie. To get our drinks from the bar. A glass of wine and tap beer shouldn't take so long! The restaurant was not busy at all. The food was good. Nothing spectacular but good. Everyone looked like they were running around like crazy even though nothing was quick. I would eat there again if it were free!"}
{"text":"So the 3 chz fried ckn was only like 5 bites and plain tasting.  The philly chz steak was very bland and way over cooked.  They took off the Cajun ckn pasta and it was the best.  Definitely will be a while before We come back here."}
{"text":"I am so blown away by some of the nasty reviews on here about The Round Bistro. I love that restaurant and I love chef Jack Acheson Jr. I've never had a bad experience at his establishment and just this past weekend my best friend and I had one of the best meals we've ever had anywhere. It was her birthday and he offered (as a new promotional event, that I understand he's offering every weekend at the moment, for drawn participants) to make a 5 course meal for the two of us. Chef Jack himself prepared every course and served them to us personally. It was wonderful and very special.  So buckle up, here it goes!   First course: fried jalapeño and pimento grit cake topped with braised collard greens and pork belly, baked peaches and marinated shredded chicken with garlic aioli. Amaze balls!!!  Second course: deconstructed egg roll salad with shredded Napa cabbage, mandarin orange segments, sliced shiitake mushrooms and radishes tossed in sesame ginger dressing and drizzled in sweet heat sauce in a fried egg roll wrapper. I couldn't get enough it was crazy awesome!  Third course: dark cherry Brunswick stew with house baked corn bread. My friend is not a fan of tomatoes so chef substituted dark cherries and that paired with the perfect amount of heat blew me away!!   Main course: whiskey marinated sirloin over sautéed bell pepper and corn medley and topped with fried string potato fries with ages balsamic drizzle with a shot of Bullet Rye. Wow insane!!!! I've never had a more tender, flavorful sirloin in my life!   Dessert: s'mores donut. Homemade donut tossed in cinnamon sugar filled with toasted marshmallow. Topped with chocolate syrup, graham cracker crumbles and whipped cream.  By this course I was about to explode but I could not help myself! Biting into a fresh, warm doughnut with what tasted exactly like a camp fire roasted marshmallow was pure heaven!!!!  It was such a fun dinner for their first \"it's your birthday month\" dinner give away at The Round Bistro! And I am extremely grateful!! Pleas give them a call for information about having one of these special meals for you and a loved one. You will not be disappointed I can guarantee that!! Again thanks to everyone at The Round! You guys rocked it out!"}
{"text":"Fried mozzarella round- I didn't like the breading but just the cheese on the perfectly toasted pita chips was very good. It was served atop sauteed spinach with a tasty sauce on it that I didn't identify but ate up.  Caesar salad- it was good. Not fantastic. More heavily dressed than I like but it wasn't fishy so it was ok.  Three cheese fried chicken- the chicken was fried to perfection and not at all greasy.  I didn't really notice the cheese flavor in the breading but it was just excellent and topped with a pepper jack cheese sauce that was delicious.  Served with a veggie choice and mashed potatoes.  Eh. The chicken was the star.  Blackened salmon- it was good. He liked mine better.  Beernaners- all kinds of yes. Like banana stuffed funnel cake. With amazing creme anglaise for dipping that I wanted to drink.  Service was good and they had a good selection of cream sodas,  wine, and beer as well as a full bar."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting a lot more because of the reviews I have read. Although it was ok and edible it was not great for me or my Freind I was there with.  She started out with the freid Asparagus which the coating was good but very greasy and he asparagus was soggy and limp.  I started with the she crab soup which was quite good but by no means had a lot of crab in it.  We both got the special NY Strip and we both thought it was tender but quite bland along with the mashed potatoe.  mixed vegetables were ok but a bit over cooked for my taste.  Overall not bad but not wowed by it."}
{"text":"Service: The waitress stated she didn't eat there and couldn't give a recommendation, she seemed bothered by the fact that she had to waitress. She left for 10 minutes without checking on us.  Food: the veggie spring rolls were so good, the cheese fondue was bland and thin I've never had fondue served with raw carrots....and I now understand why. I got the crab stuffed Portobello my son got the vegetarian Portobello option, great presentation everything just needed seasoning, not just salt and pepper but garlic onion something to give it depth. highlight of my plate was the roasted asparagus. My sons side items were scary, the \"rice pilaf\" had no veggies mushrooms anything and looked like leftover Mexican rice; the mashed potatoes had apparently been in a warming tray because one side of the mashed was dry and had the pan shape."}
{"text":"SEATING My wife and I had our first visit on a Sunday night around 6:30 pm.  We were seated right away with no waiting.  SERVICE Service was excellent.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about every menu item.  She was at our table numerous times and payed close attention to our beverages  and always refilled promptly,  Everyone on the team was very friendly.  Having Chef Jack stop by the table and answered all our questions and we enjoyed his conversation.  FOOD The Round Salad with the Cherry Vinaigrette and the Garden Salad with the Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette were very good.  They make all their own salad dressings. The Cilantro Lime is also used on the Cilantro Lime Chicken entree and makes a wonderful combination.  My wife ordered the Cilantro Lime Chicken and I ordered one of the monthly specials (the pork chop with the mango salsa)  Both entrees were delicious and had unique flavors.  The salsa had a nice little kick to it.  As with the some of the other reviewers, we had to try the Beernanas for dessert.  It was just the perfect end to delicious dinner.  We split the order and brought some home for our children who gobbled them up."}
{"text":"A co-worker recently told me about this restaurant and how much she enjoyed the she crab soup so I was excited to give it a try.  I went today with three coworkers and each of us left quite underwhelmed. First, we ordered the fondu appetizer and we were all a bit disappointed in the cheese as it was quite grainy and not as flavorful as we had expected or hoped for.  For lunch I ordered the Cajun baked penne pasta and my three coworkers all ordered the cilantro lime chicken. The three chicken plates came at the same time and I was left waiting almost another 5 minutes for my lunch. It would have been nice if all the food came out at once.  My pasta dish was served piping hot and looked great but the taste was very disappointing as it was quite bland. I had to add salt and pepper for flavor which was disappointing. All three of my coworkers told me that the chicken lacked a cilantro flavor and was on the dry side.  There were a couple positives: the service was excellent. The restaurant was not very crowded (thank goodness) as the greeter/hostess was also the server and she was definitely very busy but she kept a great attitude which I appreciated and tipped her appropriately for her hard work and great attitude. Also, the she crab soup was very tasty and I wish I had a bowl and not just a cup.  I have given three stars only because of the service and she crab soup. Had either of these two been sub par I would have only given two stars.  Overall I was very disappointed after reading the positive reviews, looking at the website, and positive word of mouth. Perhaps I just expected to much."}
{"text":"Ok- my new favorite!  Their chef served us, and he was amazing.   He shared his cool story of how he came to owning his own restaurant.   Definitely recommend the beer tasting and appetizer pairing.  He worked with us to make my meal gluten free.   Highly recommend the Sonoma Bourbon Organic cider- not too sweet- low on sugar. Another favorite!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"We tried this place last night. We had the fondue and the cilantro chicken. Both were outstanding! I would have given 5 stars if not for the time it took to get each dish (we later found out that there was a large party in the private room). The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner!  She crab soup was great and the Portobello stuffed with crab was rich and delicious.  Restaurant was surprisingly not busy at 8pm on a Saturday night. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Excellent service. Food: No so great for the price.  ME: Salad ok, small. Turkey dinner, turkey tasty, but no gravy? They did make and bring me some after my asking about gravy. Bouillon cube, stock, flour.   I think stuffing was bread & stock added to Stove Top Stuffing. HUSBAND: Salmon mousse with red onion salsa, delicious. So overall 50:50  FYI:  I never post reviews, but felt obligated to do so. Disappointed"}
{"text":"The Round Bistro is a block from my house, so it's become a regular haunt. The Round is a perfect example of a neighborhood restaurant that knows it's clientele and caters to them. It's casual, but not low class..and full of regular customers. Owned by a father and son, both named Jack..you will likely meet either or both at one point. Jack Junior is the chef and has created a menu that is traditional American, but still a bit adventurous.  They change it up monthly with a bar menu made up of regional offerings from across the United States, like Tex-Mex or Cajun.  They offer drink specials nightly - and most are insane on weeknights, like premium or local craft brews that are cheaper than a domestic in most bars."}
{"text":"I'm going to call this review, \"the scene of the crime\". The Round Bistro was one of the few remaining decently rated restaurants in Gastonia that we hadn't yet tried. We decided to have a valentines dinner early - the date 2/12/15, a Thursday - the time shortly before 8 PM. The exterior of the restaurant looks impressive, but the decor and dining furnishings on the inside are comparatively lacking. The walls appear to have a weird kind of mural. The bartender seated us and our waitress came over quickly. She told us about their monthly regional food menus - this month was New Orleans themed - and about the daily specials. She recommended the she crab soup. We ordered drinks and a cup of she crab soup and a cup of gumbo. Things went downhill very quickly from here. It took quite awhile to get out drinks and even longer for the soup. Isn't soup already prepared and easy to serve quickly? (For reference, the restaurant was not busy at all and there were at least two waitresses - also for reference ours had glasses and multiple tattoos- one being on her hand). Another waitress brought out bowls of soup ( I was confused - I thought we ordered cups?). My wife reported the she crab soup was tasty but barely even warm, almost room temperature . People like soup to be hot.... My first bite of gumbo had chicken ( also barely warm), the second, shrimp and the third something rock hard. My first thought was a chicken bone, maybe a wishbone from how big it was. I pulled the piece that I had been chewing out of my mouth- it was part of a zip tie. YES, A ZIP TIE in my food. Thank God I did not break a tooth or try to swallow that thing. I was disgusted. I was furious. I knew we were going to leave. Dinner was definitely over. I tried to get the attention of our waitress for at least 5 minutes but she was way too busy for us. When she came over I showed her what I found. She was mortified and only somewhat apologetic. I told her we were leaving, to cash us out and charge us what she thought was fair. She disappeared for quite awhile. She returned and apologized again. We were charged for the drinks and not the soup. Was that fair? Probably not. Were it my business, I would have said \"my god, I'm so sorry - just leave - you don't owe us anything\". It might have cost them $3. A manager and or chef should have come over and apologized as well. Foreign objects in food is a really big deal. Lawsuits can happen, and do. It should have been handled in a professional manner and wasn't at all. The staff really needs some sensitivity training ( or maybe just some common sense). I'm wondering if the staff even informed a manager, chef or owner at all, or just tried to \"sweep it under the rug\" to keep from getting in trouble. Needless to say we won't be back and can't recommend this place. I even left left the waitress a tip on our drinks. Why? Because even when others don't know how to handle a situation, I still try to keep things classy.  I know that odd/bad/unexpected things can happen in a kitchen. But this was not a small foreign object and the situation was handled extremely poorly."}
{"text":"The menu is not at all like the current pics - it's now a sports bar with burgers and chicken sandwiches, which is fine if they were good. But sadly, you are paying, on average, $8-$10 for frozen food that is badly fried and presented. Seriously could have prepared a better meal using frozen goods from the local grocery store - will not be going back. I do wish, however, I could rate the service separately as our server was awesome! She was handling the entire restaurant and bar by herself and was extremely nice and efficient. We felt so badly for her because the food was so horrible that we actually tipped her almost the cost of our meal as we doubted this restaurant sees a lot of business to make it worth her while. This is a great location and would  love to see them improve enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and assumed the photos of the food is what they currently serve, well that was thr first mistake. This place a sport bar with bar food. No crab cakes, steaks. Pasta no well plated meal. No no no its a sports bar. So we arrived and were the ONLY customer on a saturday. There was girl sitting at a table with her tablet, obviously one of the workers kids. Please dont bring your kids to work. Smh. Anyways back to review. Our waitess was VERY polite! We order 2 burgers one with fries one with chips. It took 35 minutes for our food to come out. We sat there and drank 2 refills of tea before i food came. Why dis it take so long???? There was another couple there too. Their food took 45 minutes to come out and when we qere leaving the waiter camw out with only a salad wow. Our burger was average nothing special  not goos not bad. The chips were too salty and greasy i could not eat them. My huaband fries were also too salty. When the bill came we paid and left. Hardee burger is better than this place. This was my first and last time here. Come here for a beer at the bar thats about it. Dont come here on a date or expect even a meal comparable to applebees because it not. Also they charged 25cent for NO tomato.  How do you charge some extra money got removing a topping.if i had know that i would have said tomato on the side and saved my 25cent.this place will probably go out of business i can see anyone with tastebuds ENJOYING a meal here."}
{"text":"I was on the fence after reading these reviews but I pulled the trigger.   1st off, they offer Alaska Airlines Dining miles, huge plus as many Carolina places don't.  2nd the prices here for what you get are amazing. They had a \"small\" bottle of wine for $10. It's 750ml which I'm 110% sure is a normal bottle of wine.   3rd the food was great. My side salad came with cherry vinaigrette, pecans and blue cheese crumbles. It was done very well.   I went with the crab stuffed portobello for dinner. I got it with asparagus and it comes with rice. It was great and I left stuffed.   The one qualm I had was they put a little too much cheese on the portobello.   Overall, Gastonia you should be pleased with this place! They also had $3 Stella's on tap. I didn't partake since I had an ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINE for $10.   I'll be back on my next work trip."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and great experience!"}
{"text":"Ate last night with my wife an brother in law and sister in law. Food was good. Service was good but $34 for a 10 oz ribeye steak was obscene. I admit the menu said market price for the steak and I did not ask but come on that price is crazy.  I could have eaten at  Old Stone in Belmont for $24 for a 12 oz ribeye that was the same quality if not better. String Bean in Belmont is head and shoulders better than this place and a good steak there would have been at least $10 cheaper if not more. Will not go back to this restaurant again. I feel like I was violated."}
{"text":"Looking for something different, decided to give it a try.  Not very crowded. We were greeted promptly by a child around 11, who was the hostess of the evening.  Greeted promptly by our waitress who rattled of the specials of the day and promptly got our drinks.  The menu is \"different\" from the area, which can be a good thing.  Combinations of flavors were a little on the questionable side, but you never know until you try it.  Prices are in line with Lotus, Nicks, or Rodi's.  We placed our orders, my husband goes of the burger, I try the Muffaletta?.  A combination of meats in a calazone style wrap. Okay..except the use of canned meat.  Looked like ham, spam or similar.  It was a chunk..might of got by with it if it had been thinly sliced.  I'm guessing it was suppose to be the \"oven roasted turkey\" could not tell.  It tasted like a calazone. Husband hamburger was edible.  Had mixed greens instead of lettuce. It was funny watching little leaves of greenery fall out of his mouth. The food was not bad, per se, just not something that would draw us back in.   Service-  Took longer than need be for the food to arrive.  We had to ask for drink refills. Place was NOT crowded. It was 8. 2 hrs before closing. Took us an hour for two \"sandwich\" meals.  Will we be back..no.  We like to go out for \"appetizers and desserts\" on our date night...did not see either that would pull us back in.  Some of the favor combinations did not entice us to try them.  It is a \"bar\" atmosphere. This is not a family style resturant.  It is a \"bistro\". Not someplace you would expect a child to be working on a weekend, even if it is \"helping out\" mom or dad in their restaurant.  Not cool."}
{"text":"We had the worst meal in along time. Boyfriends chicken meal tasted okay but it was literally 4 bites. Daughter's chicken pocket was doughey and uncooked. And my buffalo salad was a head of shettuce and cheddar cheese and one chicken tender portion on top. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The best fish I've ever had cooked in a restaurant. I got the salmon and my fiancée got the mahi mahi. It's a toss up for what was better. The only slight snag was the waitress forgot to order our appetizer (he really wanted fondue!) BUT she was so apologetic and comped us a round of drinks. Even had her manager come over to make sure we were happy. Great brunch spread too!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal at The Round on Friday! The penne pasta was amazing...and so was the Round salad!!"}
{"text":"My mother had been to Round Bistro previously and had a decent experience, so we decided to stop in for lunch when in that area.  The floor was noticeably sticky throughout the building. I ordered a San Pellegrino to drink (which was on the menu), but they were out. My mother ordered the half Reuben wrap and round salad  and I requested the she crab soup with round salad. Salads were out in a reasonable amount of time and were adequate, though not spectacular. It was a lengthy wait for the wrap and soup. The wrap was burned, the soup was mediocre. When the wrap was pointed out, the waitress asked if we wanted another one which we didn't really have time for, so she offered to change the wrap to a soup. Tomato soup was substituted. It was almost certainly canned. Neither soup came with crackers. When crackers were requested, some broken crackers were brought out on a small plate. No apologies were made for the food or experience, though our waitress was sure to point out that she had changed the charges to reflect the soup instead of the wrap. We were disappointed with the whole experience and won't return."}
{"text":"I had tried this place after it first opened and wasn't impressed, so when a friend wanted to meet here for lunch today I was reluctant.  I decided to give it another try anyway.  I ordered a water with lemon and an Asian chicken salad.  The red plastic cup I got had a lot of black stuff on the inside, (yuck..mold?) It took awhile but when I finally got my salad It was more of the size of a side salad.  This is a $10 salad mind you!  I noticed that the carrots looked old and when I started cutting into the chicken it was dry and hard like it had been setting out for days.  I sent it back, no I didn't want anything else.  I settled on a side of chips so my friend wouldn't feel bad for eating in front of me.  When it was time for the check they charged me $3 for that side of probably 10 chips.  Really?? Ok, now I have to find something to eat at home.  I won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Decided to give The Round Bistro a try Thursday for lunch.  My boyfriend and I were promptly greeted and a booth was ready for us as the place was not too crowded. Our waitress rattled off the soup of the day and brought our drinks. I decided on the \"classic round burger\" because I love A1 sauce. My bf went for Cajun chicken pasta.  Although our waitress did not check on us too often, our lunch was brought out quickly! We did have to ask twice for water refills; our waitress seemed a bit occupied on other things. My burger looked amazing; until I inspected. The bun was a croissant which must have came directly from the fridge- it was ice cold! I was very disappoint to see that my burger was literally dripping in mustard sauce to the point that the bottom bun was soggy, but not a drop of A1 sauce! (THE entire reason I had the burger!) The burger had no flavor, but the melted cheese was great. Fries were ok, should have been cooked a bit longer. My bf was definitely disappointed with his dish. It was a super small bowl with cheese noodles! No flavor and certainly not a hint of Cajun spice! A really cute setting and has potential, but recipes need to be revamped."}
{"text":"Is Round Bistro cheap? Nope.  Is the food worth every penny paid for it?  Yep, without a doubt.  Chef Jack Acheson is doing some great work in the kitchen of the former Johnny B's Pizza Pad (now extensively remodeled, I'm guessing.)  My fiancee and I started with the smoked salmon mousse appetizer, served on bagel rounds with house-made red onion marmalade. I didn't even know you COULD make marmalade out of an onion.  It was incredible.  The light saltiness of the mousse and the sweetness of the marmalade played perfectly.  Then, the she-crab soup.  Holy cats.  It was rich and smooth, with loads of crab meat. I could have eaten a gallon.  My fiancee had the Asian tuna, which was really flavorful, although I'm more of a \"real meat\" guy.  I had the black pepper pork loin, which made my entire face happy with a great pepper kick and a nicely seared crust.  For dessert, you've GOT to try the beer-nanas.  They're basically beignets with bananas inside, served in a paper sack and dusted with powdered sugar.  Dip 'em in the creme anglaise sauce and you'll be in heaven.  This is serious food, folks.  Don't come here looking for cheap chain restaurant crap.  Come here when you want local, made-by-the-order great meals."}
{"text":"All the food was great I really enjoyed my shrimp po'boy.  Service was great also. Me and my family share the monthly fried alligator tail which was nice and tender and not gamey at all.  My wife's shrimp n grits was very tasty.  My daughter salmon was nice and tender and was not over cooked like you would find at most chain restraints.  My son's build your own burger was seasoned and cooked to order, the pretzel buns had nice crust and was testy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of our favorite hangouts for a good Cajun meal and a cold beer.  With the addition of new tvs, projectors and a revamped menu, it will certainly be our go to spot to watch the away Carolina Panthers games on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I went because my gf had a groupon.  The mashed potatoes are bland, like they came from a box. Idk if I'll ever go back, but worth a try if you get the groupon"}
{"text":"Recently opened in the space formerly occupied by Johnny B's.  Owned and operated by a couple of locals, Aaron Samole & Jack Acheson.  They have a very nice and varied menu with a good selection for the First Round. Brushetta, Rock Shrimp, Fish Fritters & Crab Soup.  For the Main Round they have asian tuna, pork tenderloin, wraps & burgers along with some great salad selections.  The are putting together a great craft beer selection and currently serve Shock Top, Guinness and Red Oak. An exceptional wine selection with something for everyone.  Beer & Wine only so this is more family oriented rather than another bar destination.  They will be offering live entertainment as well.  Check them out and support your local business!"}
{"text":"I was in Gastonia for work and, as usual when I travel, I checked Yelp for the place to eat. The Round Bistro came out on top. I made my way over, sat at the bar, picked out a beer (nice draught selection by the way), and looked over the menu. There were so many great choices it was hard to decide. I had the bartender help me narrow it down to the pepper pork tenderloin with a chicken corn soup. The meal was absolutely fantastic! The flavors were decadent and I didn't leave a single scrap on any plate. I've eating at some of the best restaurants around the world, and the flavor/price ratio at The Round Bistro is probably best. One of the best meals I've had in a while. If I'm back in the area, I will definitely be making a repeat visit to try some of the other delicious looking meals."}
