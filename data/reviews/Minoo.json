{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions. They have the friendliest staff and the best Adas Pollo in the city! It tastes like homemade cooking. It's my favorite Persian place to eat at. They don't have a lot of room to sit down inside, it's mainly for take-out or catering, but you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very artistic, clean take out place. Service was efficient, the food was fresh, and tasted home made. Our orders were Baghali-polo with Mahiche, khoresht-e-fesenjon, and khoresht-e-bademjoon. The price was higher than other comparable establishments, but quality and taste were better."}
{"text":"Reliable and professional service, outstanding food, on time delivery, clean and presentable packaging and...frankly a rare gem among Persian food caterers. They've always catered for my gatherings and just last night they catered again for my Christmas party and myself and my guests couldn't be more pleased! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"One of the finest Iranian meals I've had was at minoo. I discovered them on \"just eat\" app. I hope they start delivering thru uber or skip the dishes."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and great service are three words that come to mind.   I've tried several dishes catered by Minoo, and I have to say that I am very impressed. The owners work with you to make sure you get everything you want for your event. Everything from their \"zaboon\" sandwiches, to their \"kashk-e-bademjan\", to their \"kotlets\" are all delectable. My family also enjoys their rice and stews as take-out.   Definitely keep them in mind if you're looking for a catered event because they will bring everything they've got to the table."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good catering for your party Minoo is one of the best in Toronto. Delicious food, on time delivery, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous.   So this place is close to my place of work & the only persian place around to deliver , so we usually would order from here despite the ridiculously high pricing for very mediocre food in decent packaging.   Theres an older woman who answers the phone when you call, she used to be somewhat friendly years ago.  I called yesterday to order for delivery, they state no delivery today. Okay...  Order for pickup. I told her my order. In the end , im like can u please tell me the total so we can give money to the guy picking it up?  She, with a tremendous amount of attitude as if shes in disbelief goes 'NO?!!'  Im like pardon me?  Shes like  huni, im VERY busy, you expect me to go all the way to the cash to tell u the price total?!? No. Its around 40-50.  Thanks bye   ..... first of all. Thats YOUR JOB.  Im paying you/giving u business.    So that nonesense was that . We sent this persian guy who looks white to pick up the food. He walked in earlier than expected , and asked if the foods ready.. this lady continues to give him shit for coming early . THEN PROCEEDS TO TALK SMACK ABOUT HIM IN FARSI IN FRONT OF HIM not knowing hes persian! Saying 'this guy thinks its his aunts store or something he wants to walk in and walk out right away '  & was caught im disbelief when he responded to her in farsi, saying my entire family orders from here and gives you business despite your stupid pricing for half decent food , & you want to treat me this way? Lol okay. You couldve simply said itll be another 5 minutes.   Last time i asked them to put extra sauce on my salad , they sent me a BOTTLE of minoo dressing and charged me $4 for it...   Get a grip .  Never ordering from this shit again NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"I had been to at least 6-7 Persian restaurants in Toronto since moving from Vancouver...I have to say it's been surprisingly a wonderful culinary experience. The staff ( only one lady to serve) has been friendly, but most importantly, the quality of the food is par excellence. Kudos to the chef!!!! My only beef with them is that they are a catering house, so limited seating arrangement for a restaurant. You should try the Barg and Vaziri... Finger licking tasty.. The cucumber yogurt is awesome, the Gormeh dishes ( bademjan) heavenly. Finally, ask for Persian tea that comes with desert sampler called Khorma!!!"}
{"text":"Minoo has some of the best Persian cusine I have ever tasted. Their staff is well trained and are very nice. If you're craving Persian, I would definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time couple of weeks ago with my wife.  We ordered \"kubideh\" and \"Barg\".  The taste and quality of the meat were good, however, encountered couple of issues which I hope the owner reads this post and act accordingly to improve on the following issues because we liked the place and would like to see the business thrive.    1- Food was ready/served under 3 minutes!!   No Iranian kobab should be ready that fast, which means only one thing;  The food was precooked and they just warmed it up which is a big NO NO and again, NO!  2- The prepackaged SUMAC on the table was horrible and felt like you are chewing on sand with every bite which ruined the entire experience.   How much does it cost really, to get a high quality Sumac in a restaurant? Preparing fresh kobabs will make a huge difference in customers visiting the place again and again or never ever!   Pros:  friendly service, relatively clean and modern setting"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my wife. There are only a few seats for eating in, but the interior was really nice. After ordering at the counter, our food was brought out to our table. We ordered the Salari kabab (chicken leg and ground veal -- separate kababs), the Baghali Polo with lamb shank, and the Fesenjan stew.  It was my first time eating Persian food, and even though not all of the flavour profiles agreed with me, the food was really good and well prepared. The kababs were absolutely delicious.  The only thing to note is that for eating in, they only prepare some of the stews and main dishes on a given day. I would return to try some more of the stews."}
{"text":"Delicious and excellent fresh home style Persian cuisine. Very clean restaurant and polite staff. Highly recommended. Specially for picky people!"}
{"text":"We've ordered food from Minoo for large dinner parties twice now. They are great with getting our orders correct, the food is delicious and prepared on time. The meat is consistently tender, juicy and flavorful. Their salad is fresh and they even provided a little bottle full of salad dressing for our last order which was for +10 people. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I didn't even go there because I was disgusted by how they talk to ppl. When you contact regarding catering you should welcome your possible customer with hi hello or something ... Yes zero !  Then I asked about sandwiches and kabobs and instead sending a menu they gave me price range and said depending ... Depending on what !!!!! Very rude and far from catering !  I never experience this behaviour in LA"}
{"text":"I've tried several dishes here an very impressed with their great service and delicious foods, especially the stews. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The quality of food is just great!  I love the doogh. The sandwiches are delicious. The barg is nice."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great service. We had Joojeh and Koobideh. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The koobideh was cooked perfectly."}
