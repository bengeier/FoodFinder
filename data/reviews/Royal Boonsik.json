{"text":"Been meaning to test out this place and finally went there yesterday with a few friends.  The place is nice a clean. There aren't many tables so the place might look a little empty. The owners are welcoming and friendly.  And the food was great too. They probably have the best kimbabs in k-town haha.  We ordered kimbab, jjolmyun, ramyun with mandu and dwenjang jjigae. The kimbab was freshly made and the seaweed smelled really toasty. Its amazing. Jjolmyun was good too. Quite spicy but at the same time, really refreshing. We also intended to order some steamed mandu but they were out (only had enough for my friend's ramyun) so I assume their mandu must be good.  It was an overall good experience at a korean style fast food/snack bar.  Oh, I would also like to note that this is one of the few korean restaurants that use nice glass water bottles (those IKEA ones) and not those plastic-free when buying soju-water bottles.   The only problem we had here really was that they're a little slow with splitting bills. But hey at least they were willing to do it right?"}
{"text":"They have the best kimbap in town.  I've tried countless.  It's warm, fresh and they make it on the spot if you ask.  Nice, quiet people."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place still has 4 star rating. I went to this place some time ago trusting the high rating, and ended up having one of the worst experiences in the Bathurst area.  The gimbap  (Korean sushi) is good. Soondae was definitely microwaved, as the casing of the sausage was super hard and dry and just terrible, because it smelled like a freezer because of improper storage. I was reminded of all the episodes of Kitchen Nightmares and their microwaved food. The dumplings came boiled although it is supposed to be fried or steamed, according to the menu. We asked for steamed, and they were served submerged in the water they were boiled in.  Also, our server was terribly rude although we were perfectly well-mannered, quiet customers that didn't even ask him any questions. He was very attentive and all smiles to another group of young people around his age though. He actually even ignored us once completely when we tried to get his attention."}
{"text":"Good home style Korean food at good prices. Best is the kimbap and pork bone soup. Great if you get kimbap to go to eat on the run."}
{"text":"Just had the best dolsot bibimbap that I've ever had in Koreatown.  I also thought their side dishes were nice, especially the japchae.  Really friendly owners who you can tell put a lot of love in to the preparation of their dishes, even if the restaurant itself isn't as dressed up as some of the others in the area.  I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"my korean hairstylist from down the street recommended this place for the best kimbap in the city- and she wasn't kidding. i used to live in korea so i know what good kimbap tastes like, and the tuna kimbap here is TO DIE FOR. like SO GOOD, SO MOIST, SO FLAVOURFUL!   I've had their tteokbokki too and it's also good =)"}
{"text":"I had kimbab and soondae. The house kimbab was fresh and delicious. They make it as you order. The side dishes were fresh and goes well with boonsik. Soondae was nothing special but as i was craving for one i ordered. I wish they give a small miso soup along with the kimbab since it was a bit too dry to eat just the roll itself. The service was fast and the waitress was nice. I will go back to try their other menu."}
{"text":"Stir fry on hot plate was great, and this place might do it better than most other places around the area. I tried soondae, and honestly did not like the soft steamed texture. Also, their banchan could be better and they offer less banchan than most places in the area."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Food is very tasty (just a little spicy though, so I'd ask for a more mild sauce next time!) I tried the rabokki, soondae, and stir fry pork(dupbap)! All very tasty. I never had soondae before and this was the only place I ever found it at! Don't hate it but don't love it, but always cool to try new dishes. The other dishes were great though! One thing is that the rabokki had less rice cakes than I thought it would, but it was pretty filling regardless! And prices are pretty cheap (under $10 per dish)."}
{"text":"Good solid place. Prices are ok for students. Very filling for 2 at the price of $27~ish. Would have been ok if we hadn't ordered the dduk-bok-i which was about $5 (so works out to about $22 for filling up two people, not bad). The waiter and chefs are nice people too. Will be returning when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Korean restaurant even though the place is very unassuming. As other reviewers have indicated, there's no TV or Kpop playing near by. The setting is very minimal. The place has a great selection of Kimbap and Mandu than other places. I love this place for their Katsu. Either Donkatsu or Chicken Katsu. Their soondae is just okay. I also love their Spicy Pork Dupbap and Bibimbap."}
{"text":"I'm a gamjatang addict :') but my Korean friends urged me to try different Korean dishes. They took me to Royal Boonsik and boy, it did not disappoint.   As much as I love gamjatang, I love kimbap probably just as much. This place has the BEST kimbap I've had in Toronto! If I ever need a good kimbap fix, I'm coming here! We also ordered the rice cakes, stir fried pork and a fried platter filled with veggies.   I will definitely be coming back here! The restaurant is very open, and clean. The food is not salty, but flavored just right. Apparently it's as close as you can get to Korean food back in Korea. So I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is relatively small but it has a nice atmosphere to eat. I think it's family run considering how many customers were friends with the chefs and cooks. I found that the price here is much cheaper than other Korean stores nearby. There were four side dishes: bean sprouts, fish cakes, kimchi, and pickled radish. All side dishes were delicious. My brother ordered the bibimbap and I ordered the kimchi pork stew. They were both served very hot but I believe the bibimbap could have been flavoured more (the veggies) but presentation was on point! Most likely will return for the dukbukki."}
{"text":"Can't say much more than kimbap. One of the closest you can find to a home made kimbap in K-town. Reminds me of my childhood.  The owners first started off as a kimbap and mandoo pick up restaurant but now have added in seating with a larger menu. I have tried their deng jung jigae and rap-bokgi. Of course they still have their delicious kimbap and mandoo. The wife has tried most of their seafood dishes and has always been completely satisfied.  The service is good and the owners are very nice (could be because I'm Korean too). I always feel like I'm at a friend's house and their parents are feeding me.  My parents live a couple of hours away, so if I have a hankering for some home cooked Korean food - my tush comes straight here.  Yummy home cooked food. Love it here."}
{"text":"Watered down ddukbokgi? Overpriced kimbap? \"Methinks not\" is right! Why is it more expensive to dine in and eat kimbap anyway? And why did they water down our ra-bokgi (ddukbokgi with ramen)? The sauce should've been thick, spicy, and sweet, but instead, we got a runny sauce that was flavorless.   The kimbap was good but the price just wasn't worth it. If you go over to PAT Central, they have more for about the same price. Overall, I just don't think this place is great. Go somewhere else, save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Forever love this place! Sometimes they'll give you an extra banchan, and yesterday when I went they gave us a bowl of soup! Awesome. Like I mentioned in my previous reviews, their kimbap is a must get and give their mandu a try..all homemade!"}
{"text":"Boonsik is quite unique relative to its neighbour restaurants as it specializes in mandu (Korean dumplings) and kimbap (Korean rice roll, similar to sushi), among other specialty dishes. This family restaurant is so low key that you really have to be looking for this place. But beyond it's unassuming store front awaits friendly service and delicious Korean food.  My companion and I both had eyes bigger than our stomachs and we ended ordering 4 dishes: fried mandu, bulgogi kimbap, pork bone soup, and kimchi stew with pork. We also received 4 side dishes. I HIGHLY recommend the traditional kimbap, having tried all variations. It's simple but delicious. The fried mandu is always a win as well. Just wait for it to cool as it comes out piping hot.  Compared to the appetizers, the kimchi stew wasn't striking - the broth just wasn't my favourite. My companion really enjoyed the pork bone soup though; the pork bones were piled high, along with a healthy portion of potatoes.   This is true gem in the Ktown area!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Korean restaurant to grab kimbab. I have mad cravings for their spicy rice cakes every month. It's irresistible!"}
{"text":"I'm uncertain what transpired at RMP.   Let's piece the puzzle together.  -  Non-Korean(moi) enters RMP. -  Small operation Mom/Pop Korean. -  RMP has barely any Menu/English. -  Window has more Menu than inside. -  Furnishings is temporary-stay quality. -  Notice the Food Counter/Prep Area. -  Water pour-on-your-own Free. -  Disposable Plates/Chopsticks/Cups. -  Overheard Hours(6am(?) - 7pm)  My realization of what is Royal Mandu Plus:  -  Korean light Breakfast/Lunch/Snack Shop. -  Gyoza, Mandu, Royal Gimbap, Kimchi, etc... -  Pick Item / Pay / Eat / Clean Garbage / Go"}
{"text":"We've tried a number of places in Koreatown and this is definitely one of my favourites. Not quite as many types of banchan as some places but the kimbap was fantastic. The bulgogi (and the steel plate) was also really good. My only criticism was that the Katsu was so thin that it seemed a bit too dry. The sauce was good though.  We did have to wait a long time for our food, but they were really apologetic and even the cook/chef came out to say sorry."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of people when our usual korean restaurant was full. I have to say, I really liked the clean layout of the restaurant and the amount of space they had in comparison to some of the other restaurants in korea town.   I had the donkatsu (pork cutlets) and it was amazing. It was nice and crispy but the meat inside was flavourful and the sauce brought everything to the next level. My friend had the beef bibimbap and he really liked his food too.  Overall, I recommend this place if you want somewhere more clean looking with a bit more breathing room. Definitely try the donkatsu if you get the chance."}
{"text":"So surprised that I haven't written a review for this place yet but this place is amazing. The last time I came here was in March 2016 lol need to come back soon.  What we ordered: - Bulgogi kimbap $5.50 - Cheese kimbap $5.50 - Donkatsu $8.50 - Odeng soup (free service)  The kimbap here is absolutely amazing, I don't know what they do but it is so darn delicious that I am honestly just drooling thinking about it to be honest lol we went with their bulgogi and cheese (highly recommend). Their donkatsu was mediocre at best, it was sort of dry but meh. The small restaurant is popular for their kimbap so if you're having a kimbap craving definitely come here."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the tuna kimbap at Royal Boonsik! The homemade mandu is fantastic too. My partner and I live nearby so we're working our way through the rest of the menu and the only thing that hasn't been delicious so far is the don katsu.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is friendly so I wholeheartedly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is for all the non-Koreans out there who've been/ or plan to try this place and need some quick facts.  Royal Boonsik is good. Yes it is a Korean restaurant but it is NOT your typical traditional Korean restaurant with like 10 different banchan and various soup and rice meals. You can think of it as a Korean style fast food joint with the traditional Korean boonsik favourites (in Korean \"boonsik\" means flour based food). So it is a type of Korean food very popular in korea, and it's not the healthiest stuff (BUT SO GOOD) so can be thought of as Korean fast food. So if you want specialty kimbap, deep fried seaweed laver rolls, deep fried squid and veggies this is where you go because your not going to get that anywhere else in k-town.  If you want to eat gamjatang at this place, by all means go ahead but just keep in mind that you are missing out on some of the other dishes!   I usually get the tuna kimbap, \"kimmalee\" (deep fried seaweed laver rolls), and \"rabbokki\" (Instant noodles and rice cakes cooked in hot pepper paste sauce) and dip the kimbap rolls and kimmalee in the sauce."}
{"text":"I've been eating Korean food for years. I eat in Korea town ALL. THE. TIME. However, this was my first time at Royal Boonsik. A friend brought me and I just had what was one of the best Korean meals of all times here. We started off with Manduguk (this great soup with THE! BEST! (homemade) FRESH! DUMPLINGS! It also has egg and some grated carrot as well as pieces of dukbogi. OH. MY. GOD. I don't want to tell you people about this place because now I'll never get a seat. We then had Oh Jing Uh Dup Bap - which was spicy veggies and wonderfully (not too chewy, not undercooked - just right) yummy squid on rice. It has kick but is really flavourful and satisfying. Don't get it if you can't handle the heat. Our server was great, and you could probably ask for it to be less spicy (I liked it, but then again I always ask for \"Korean people spicy\" not \"white people spicy\"). I was told that it's family owned (you could see the husband in the back kitchen making the dumplings, the wife was on the other side of him, cooking something else and their son was the (excellent, friendly and professional) server.  I'm picturing the food now.....Mmmm. I want some more now. It was all so satisfying! Who knows? I may be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"LEGIT.  This place used to look like a complete dive (I don't even know if they ever had seats), but has recently been transformed into the kind of Korean restaurant you could take your wife's Korean grandmother to.  Happily, they continue to provide top-notch kimbab (like a Korean California roll), and mandu (dumplings - fried or steamed), while serving up a fine array of soups, stews, etc.  Very friendly mom and pop service (including a fat, delightful son), and great food. No obnoxious TVs blaring K-pop, which is a blessing."}
{"text":"Nice family, the fluffiest royal mandu (the steamed ones - my favourite being the pork/meat ones).  The Korean version of Chinese \"bau\".  This place is lovely.  Their kimchi mandu are great, very flavourful with the distinctly orange colour of kimchi mandu.  Their royal mandu are their signature - big, huge, fluffy mandu - filled with either \"pat\" (red bean paste) or gogi (meat).  Nice owners as well.  Have tried their kimbab which was very tasty.  Not shy with the sesame seed oil -- just the way it should be.  I am a fan for sure.  They have different twigim (fried, Korean-style tempura - squid, sweet potato and chap-chae in seaweed).  Tried it - too greasy for me but a good option if you're out on a soju night and looking for anju."}
{"text":"love their food. had pretty much everything on their menu, and they are all very good/decent. but as you can expect from their name, boonsik menus are the best. I love their bulgogi kimbab along with ttokboki,  fish cake soup and soondae. it's not a fancy place for formal dinner or anything. casual atmosphere. good price."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant in Toronto by far, and it deserves far more customers than they get. Hopefully the emptiness of the restaurant the many times I've been there just means that most people are getting takeout.  It is a lovely, family-run restaurant. Tommy, the owners' son, is a very nice guy and a great server. Generally the staff they hire are also friendly. Their house gimbap and mandu (Korean dumplings) are to die for. If you want a great Korean food experience, there's nowhere better to go than here for some homemade food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed another great meal at Royal Boonsik (formerly known as Royal Mandu Plus) last night. We have been frequenting this establishment for years now, and the Korean Rolls (kimbap) are the best in the city - bar none! We used to order platters of kimbap and mandu for parties and gatherings from them even before they were in their current Bloor West location.  I just saw this nice article as well:  http://wp.me/p2NGKq-30e  The couple is SO nice and friendly. Their English is pretty decent, but not perfect....my Korean is not great either. I do see non-Koreans at the restaurant, and the owners always make everyone feel welcome.  We usually order some sort of combination of mandu (in soup or steamed), one or two rolls (we like beef), ra-book-ki (spicy ramen noodle dish with rice cakes), twi-geem (Korean style tempura), and other homemade Korean dishes. A great meal every time, no matter what we order - at a very good price.  I see everyone else ordering the soon-dae (Korean sausage), but that is not my thing. It must be good, since everyone seems to order it. Ra-book-ki and tempura are also very popular at other tables.  For your next party, you can consider ordering a kimbap platter. A medium round platter has A LOT of rolls (10 \"lines\" of rolls?), and looks very pretty too. Can be a nice appetizer dish for guests to eat while chatting and having drinks. The prices are so reasonable. You can a mixture of beef rolls, tuna rolls, cheese rolls, vegetarian rolls, etc.  I will see you there!  Royal Boonsik 647 Bloor Street West Toronto ON M6G 1L1 (416) 530-6974  MON-SAT: 11 am - 9 pm CLOSED ON SUNDAYS"}
