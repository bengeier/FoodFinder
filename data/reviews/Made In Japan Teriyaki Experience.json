{"text":"We hadn't tried this place before and it's too bad we didn't check for reviews beforehand.  It was overpriced, empty, barely any vegetables or meat, chopped up small noodles that were literally swimming in teriyaki sauce.  Both myself and my husband felt sick afterwards.  The one staff member that was there however, were very friendly. We won't be going back here, ever again!"}
{"text":"They barely understand what you are saying. So explaining that you have a gift card is like rocket science. Iv been to many teriyaki and this one does not use the proper ingredients."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  Wish I had read the reviews before hand.  Charged $30 for 2 small horrible meals and 6 microwaved dumplings.  Honestly the worst place I have ever eaten with the microwave being the first item in the kitchen which she immediately used.  Took about double the time of edo and about double as bad.  No one should ever support this place,  no wonder it is so dead.  Will be telling everyone I know to never eat here."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good when they opened. Ingredients were fresh and cooked to order. They have since gone way downhill. Veggies are not fresh. Meat sits and is reheated. Overall quality is now consistently terrible - you can see it and taste it. Won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"The owner ALWAYS short-changes us, about 50 cents each time. She would ask us what sauce we want and we answer \"teriyaki and hot sauce\" she would said \"no you only get teriyaki sauce\"... then why did you even ask???
The size of the meal is so small, comparing to other similar types of fast food restaurants, and they still have to short-change their customers??? We are sure that it's not an accident because she does that ALL THE TIME!
The way the owner treats her employees is horrible too, a lot of times we can see her pushing around her employees or simply take over the task the employees are doing because they are not doing it \"fast or good enough\""}
{"text":"It is a chain restaurant and the prices are high, but it is good food and they are friendly.  They don't speak English well, but they are nice and polite."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast, consistent, good services.

Such a great alternative to grabbing a burger or a sub. Faster too and you aren't left feeling gross. The staff are pleasant and prompt. We have gone here  several times and there has never been anything to complain about.

It is certainly not high end dining-it is fast food- but for what it is, they do a great job at it."}
{"text":"Cheap price, good food, quick service, prepared fresh right in front of you very quickly. The serving size is a bit small but it's actually about perfect. Their daily special is a great deal."}
{"text":"A chain restaurant is a chain restaurant, but I find that the Teriyaki Experience restaurants are among the better \"fast Japanese food\" places I've visited in the city.

I hadn't been here in a long time, so coming back again for (an unplanned) dinner was really nice. We almost always get the special, and it always delivers - $10 for beef and chicken teriyaki with a spring roll will never not go out of style.

I enjoy the odd visits to this place when I want dinner that's filling and hearty. It's not necessarily the cheapest around, and the design of the restaurant is a bit dated as others have mentioned, but I find very few faults with the place. The experience is always consistent, which is why I've continued to visit year after year.

This Teriyaki Experience is a safe bet if you're looking for a decent meal that won't leave you starving at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Went here during lunchhour on a Friday.  

Even though it was very quiet inside (we were # 3 and 4 in the queue to actually get our food after paying), it took 10 minutes for our \"fast\" lunch to make an appearance.  One lady was doing all the work, and barking orders at the other lady, who seemed to be new to the systems.  I think that disappointed me most -- the barking of orders.  All of us have been new to something, and none of us learned anything through that kind of help.

Once our food arrived, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I had the spicy soup noodle bowl.  It was okay ... not much flavour to it; broth was lukewarm.  

In summary: I have definitely been to better japanese fast food places.  I'll be looking elsewhere for lunch next time."}
{"text":"I came here with my cousin, so here are her words about the place. 
\"The food is made with speed, so there wasn't a long wait. It's  not like buffet food where you feel bloated afterwards, I don't feel bad after eating it, it feels healthy. The staff was super friendly, we had a friendly conversation with both of the employees the whole time. We came on a Saturday around 4pm, so there was no other customers there and we had their full attention. I would go again for a quick good meal, if I was in Canada again.\""}
{"text":"OH MY GOD.  This place was terrible.

I came in to an empty location with my girlfriend thinking, this place we haven't tried yet, let's give it a shot on a Sunday afternoon (both of us hungry).  

What a mistake.  

There was one couple ahead of us, and they ordered two wraps.  Once they paid, and were issued their change, the customer asked why he was shorted five dollars.  The cashier, smiled and gave a quizzical look of either smug capture or awkward embarrassment, and said, oh you're right, I will give it back to you once I take this next order to open the till.

I took note, but thought it an honest error.

We ordered a noodle dish with beef & shrimp which came to 9.75, and order of dumplings (over priced) at 6.09, a cup of miso soup 2.49, and one can of diet coke, which I showed the cashier at time of purchase.  She nodded and said okay.  My girlfriend had my wallet and paid the bill with me not really paying attention to the price.  

The till popped open and the first couple got their correct change back.

We sat down waiting for our order to be completed, and once we got our order, it as a train wreck.  But I'll get to that in a second.  

I asked my gf what she ended up paying for the order, she said $25 dollars or so.  WHAT?!?  We had one meal shared and it didn't seem right, I asked her for the receipt which she did not have.  I went up to the counter and saw a stack of receipts on the counter by the till, and reached for ours, since we were last it was easy to find.  

The cashier had charged us for \"extra noodles\" .99, \"extra rice noodles\".50 on our DUMPLINGS?!, and 4.56 for TWO bottles of FUZE drink.  Note, bottles are more than cans, and we had one can, and it definitely was not a Fuze drink.  Nod of confirmation from her my ass....  

I confronted her about my extra charges, and she claimed it an accident.  Interesting.  I asked for my refund, she said she cannot give me a refund, she has to call the manager.  What?!  This was her theft er, mistake, and now I can't get my money back?  I complained further, stating I will make a big stink, and she gave me a partial refund.  Wait a minute, the refund was not the complete amount for my order.  WTF?!  I caught her again!!! She finally fixed it properly when she saw the look of death come from me.  

I went and sat down 15 minutes later of battling for my money back only to find that my gf didn't eat much of the food.  Noodles untouched, dumplings, one eaten of the six and one bitten.  I asked her what was wrong with it, and then I took a bite. 

I literally spit the bite onto the plate and deemed this product/dish inedible.  Refund to ensue on my mind.  

Yet another battle.  She didn't want to refund and said this was not her fault.  I said I don't care, it's TERRIBLE, and I'm returning the plate of product.  

She gave me $5 from the till and asked if that was enough.  Wow.  The stereotype of the bargaining asian did not need to stick here.  NO.  I want my $6 back and you keep the change.  

I asked for the manager's number which lead to a dead end, and probably a fake name.  Peter 403 542 5426.

I fearlessly gave her my business card and said, someone from Teriyaki will hear from me.  

I also should mention that I not only took photos, but recorded the ENTIRE conversation with the cashier \"Christine\" that was as shady as I've ever seen.  I plan on following up with head office.  

Unacceptable.

We walked out of the location and threw our noodles into the garbage.  

Let's nutshell today's experience:
- witnessed short changing of a customer in front of us
- over charged for items on our order
- refusal to refund
- bad product
- unapologetic behaviour
- refusal to refund
- veiled threats from manager or owner who \"doesn't care\" about my experience (according to cashier/employee)
- several flies circulating the preparation are (didn't mention how unsettling that was)


****UPDATE*****

Just checked the website.  THIS LOCATION CHARGES .50 MORE PER ITEM THAN LISTED ON WEBSITE.  MEANING THEY ARE STEALING FROM CUSTOMERS.

wow.  

Contacted head office - check
Contacted BBB - soon
Contacted on site manager (assuming the cashier is not the owner as I suspect) - soon
Satisfaction - trying."}
{"text":"Bad bad food. We went there for dinner after 8 pm since all other restaurants were closed. microwaved dumplings, soggy udon noodles soaking in teriyaki sauce with no chicken. They don't offer any filtered water. Bad bad food with a loud mouth cashier!!  Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was just what i needed.  It was good, and healthy and fresh and affordable.  We dropped in for lunch yesterday since the fast food options in the area didnt seem to appeal to anyone.  I had the teriyaki salmon on rice and everything was just the way i like it.  The veggies were still a bit crisp and the salmon was flaky and anything topped with teriyaki just seems better.  My son had the beef teriyaki with udon noodles, and it seems this is the only way i can get a young fella like him to eat all his veggies, so this place must have some magical powers and for that reason alone, i will return.  It may be fast food, but its good food."}
{"text":"This teriyaki place is tasty, and interesting. 
I have been going here since it opened a few years ago. As far as this teppanyaki style restaurant goes, it is pretty standard...order, food is cooked before you and its all done cafeteria style. 
Unlike some of these places they dont precook the chicken or beef, they always cook it to order.  The restaurant is japanese themed and usually tidy. The odd time there is a the odd uncleared table. ( Remember to clear your tray in the garbage people :)  )  And last time I was in there, I discovered to my horror AFTER using the toilet that there was NO TOILET PAPER!  It was brutal, I looked around the entire single washroom ( a single person washroom) and there was nothing... needless to say I made a hasty exit to my car and home! Thankfully this happened after I ate. 
This franchise location is owned by a husband and wife, she is hilarious and loud. Sometimes she brings her son in ( about 6) and he sits at a table reading etc, and is generally quiet and keeps to himself. Other times he is running around yikes!  One time I was in there and the husband and wife were clearly in a big argument, i was alone in the restaurant and they were arguing and she was MAD!  It was funny, but also uncomfortable...that said I really like going in here. They always acknowledge me, remember me and say hello! They always thank me and say goodbye. Very mom and pop, and I like that. 
Check it out, food is good and service is great."}
{"text":"Tried ginger sesame beef signature meal and Pan Asin shrimp .

Both of them tasted same , boiled noodles topped up with beef/ shrimp tossed in sweet teriyaki sauce cooked on a hot plate .

Signature meals are served with beef gyoza which were smelling of stale meat ! 

Only the Ambience is good . Owner really needs to improve quality n taste to survive in this competitive place ! Tap local taste n do some kinda fusion innovation to drive food enthusiasts!!

Very very below average ! May not visit again !!"}
{"text":"This is a super quick take out place - 3 stars for take out.  *2.5 stars* - maybe even 2 if it were a real restaurant.
This place is located in the 401 Dixie Auto Mall - reasonably busy, particularly at lunch time on the weekdays b/c of all the offices etc that are nearby.  I ordered the tofu yakisoba noodles.  It was super salty today.  I've had the same dish here before, and it's not been as salty.  Today might have been an anomaly.

Not bad for lunch, but not a crazy stellar dining experience.  I was hungry, there was food. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Teriyaki experience is the same across the board. But this place has less portions, looks old and feels old. In need of a major renovation.  I would rather go to other locations than this."}
{"text":"Two word summary: \"Glorified Ramen\" I would probably not eat here again unless I had to. Was staying at a nearby hotel and didn't  want to walk far in the cold. I had to douse the chicken noodle soupe with lots of sauce to created an edible flavor broth."}
{"text":"All I really want to say about this place is that it's about a thousand percent better than Edo of Japan.  Most people probably think of the two as interchangeable, and some are probably even a little surprised to read this and learn that they're not one and the same, since they're nearly identical in concept and in menu.  However, this place (with a name that sounds more like a ride at Tokyo Disney  than a fast food restaurant) excels over Edo for having much higher quality meats (for instance, chicken breast instead of Edo's nasty leg meat), for having brown rice as an option, and for being able to cook with water instead of oil upon request.

The only thing that Edo has on this place is better hot sauce, but given that I'm not sure what hot sauce has to do with teriyaki anyway, I can't hold this against MIJTE."}
{"text":"This  place  always seemed really good 
Had to try this, quite a distance from my home
This was my disappointment of the month orderd sesame beef bowl whch came with gyozas 
These were sad with very little meat in it it was less than half a teaspoon meat in each gyoza
The worst Asian food I had 
The beef was extremely sweet like a dessert with absolutely no flavours 
It was steamed plain noodles with over sweet beef in it 
I was hungry as this dinner was my first meal for the day
Couldn't eat it no veggies except some peppers and carrots that too sweet 
The interior was good and the people at the counter not very helpful
Extremely sweet food 
I would pass it"}
{"text":"I will not be back to @Teriyaki_Exp in Deerfoot Meadows. The lady there seemed too pushy and overcharged us.  When we ordered she overcharged us by adding an extra charge of mushrooms when we didn't ask for it.  I only discovered it because I asked for my receipt.  She gave us back the $0.50 after I asked her about it.  She turned flush and dismissed it as she pressed the wrong button accidentally.  At home I realized an extra charge of noodles (I ordered rice) when we got home as I assumed she mistakenly gave me noodles instead  of rice.  When I got home it was rice that I got but she added on another $0.50 for noodles (which I did not receive).  This isn't the first time this location short changes and overcharges people from what I read in the previous reviews it has been happening for years (since 2011).  She got away with overcharging us $0.50 and it may have been $1.  Imagine if she does this to people all the time?

The menus make it easier for new customers (like us) to get confused and not know how much our meals are, I think she takes advantage of this.  I may go to the BBB about this incident as I do not want this to happen to anyone else.

As for the food it was average.  I may go to other locations but never this one as I think the lady there scams people.  I think needs some investigation honestly as what she is doing is criminal.  I will be telling everyone I know about this incident."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night for a quick bite between shopping and it was not good. 

Ordered a vegetable yakisoba and a vegetable udon and received two vegetable udons. 

Then I discovered old beef in my stir fry which was not cool as I don't eat meat. 

The next day my bf and I had massive stomach pains and felt very sick. I felt better in 24 hours but it definitely know it was the meal here that made me sick.

Perhaps because the grill or utensils comes into contact with raw meat, it might not be cooked off or something.  Anyway I will not be back. Edo Japan is my favourite for this kind of quick thing and at least has mushrooms and broccoli. This was mostly cabbage, so when it's only veggie it's kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"I'll come here when I want healthy food for reasonable price. The food is fried not with oil but water so it doesn't add any more calories than you need. 

My favorite dish is the shrimp and chicken special for $7.29. It's very tasty and healthy. 

Did I mention that the food here is healthy? Lol"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I want a quick, reasonably healthy fast food.
They cook using only water so the food is not greasy.

The serving size seems small until you work your way through it and realize it's the right size....

My fav here is the shrimp and chicken teriyaki."}
