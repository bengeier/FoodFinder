{"text":"My all time favorite Italian place to eat at.From the pizza to the mussels,all delicious.Livio and the rest of the staff are very professional.Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was really good however the service was awful! From the moment we sat down the server was rolling his eyes and making stupid comments, many dishes were forgotten and some of us were given our antipasto after our mains. Half of our group ordered coffee and then the rest of the group was given their bill and told that they were closed and could no longer order. Needless to say, we will never be coming back."}
{"text":"A gem in Little Italy!  It reminds me so much of my grandmothers cooking. Huge portions, a lot of quality ingredients and flavour, and a lot of love in the food. The atmosphere really adds to all of this as well, as it has an \"old school Italian\" look.   My boyfriend and I went for dinner. We had a bottle of wine to share. $27 for a bottle of white is very reasonable, and the waiter did a little 'wine test' before we bought the bottle. I ordered the Cesar salad to start, and had fettuccine Alfredo for my main. Both were extremely generous portions, and both were so rich and creamy. My boyfriend had the salmon penne-it was so flavourful and they did not skimp on the salmon.   If you're looking for really authentic Italian resturant on college, skip Standard or Vivoli and head to Regina's instead. You can tell its a family run place, with a really close knit team behind them. Will keep returning again and again."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Little Italy, because even though there are a lot of Italian restaurants, not all of them are very good. Regina's is authentic Italian comfort food, in biggish Canadian-sized portions. My fave pastas so far are the spaghetti carbonara and the spaghetti and meatballs are very tasty. The pastas with seafood are also very good. If you have room for an appetizer, try their take on bruschetta, which is made with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes. When the weather is nicer I'll try their pizza and desserts. The wine selection is small, but good enough."}
{"text":"We've been ordering takeout from Regina's for a DECADE!!!!!!  Looooooooove everything especially . . . the SUPER DUPER SPICY (by request) gnocchi with meat sauce.  Foodie tip:  order TWO orders of garlic bread with cheese because leftovers are extra delish for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Second visit, and the server already recognized us!  (And no, we weren't rowdy or anything - they're just attentive!)  The restuarant was very busy this weekend (first visit was on a week night and it was pretty quiet) but the food didn't take too long despite this.  Consistent quality, service with friendly banter, and good food all around.  And the best part is they take reservations!  This is likely to become one of our go-to's for a casual italian meal."}
{"text":"We went into this restaurant not knowing what to expect but were really impressed! The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming, and the service was fantastic! The menu had many options, I chose the manacotti which was delicious- the ricotta filling was very fresh.   I would recommend this place if you are looking for good and affordable Italian food in Little Italy. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Great saucey lasuagna and the pizza is great too. The Quattro fromageo is great, nice classic pie. Worth the money. But don't count on a great wine selection."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant tonight after reading the reviews here on Yelp and seeing it averaged out at 4 stars. I wouldn't agree with that rating at all. It was alright, but nothing special. Their service was passable -- it was efficient but not very friendly. The food tasted decent but it wasn't anything above average. The ambience is ok and the prices were fine. They don't scrimp on their glasses of house wine though, I'll give them that! When all is said and done I can't say as I was excited by the experience here and I will probably try somewhere new next time I'm craving Italian."}
{"text":"Have been a loyal client for over 20 yrs, food has always been excellent and price fair and reasonable. Always a great meal with great service from all there, bravo to Vince and Lee."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and still enjoying the food.  The pasta is always cooked perfectly and the sauce is one of the best I have ever tasted.  Pizza is crispy and delicious, the salads are great and so are the veal dinners.  Pass on the veal sandwiches and stick to the chicken parmigiana."}
{"text":"Despite the amazingly sofisticated and refined service, their Gnocchi is the best I've ever had in Toronto. Light and bold, their pesto Gnocchi has all the notes and flavour combined with a bold and light pasta.  I would easily come back often, and order some delivery for sure."}
{"text":"I only get the paninis every time I come, but what paninis they are. The taste of a freshly made veal or steak sandwich is to die for. I just wish it was a bit less messy to eat."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite places. The service is what stands out the most. Every single person you encounter in the restaurant is lovely and kind, and tries to improve your day in any way possible. It's impossible to leave here unhappy.  The food was fresh and delicious! Service is fabulous! It's never been too crowded when I've visited (surprisingly).   Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pas mal du tout: leur pizza à l'ancienne est très agréable, les pâtes se mangent bien. J'y suis passé bien 5 ou 6 fois en quelques mois, toujours bien reçu, excellent service et peut-être, je dis bien peut-être, le dernier restaurant véritablement authentique dans ce quartier italien."}
{"text":"The BEST PIZZA in the GTA there nothing better.  I grew eating there food and all there dishes are great.  Great dinning on College St Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here last week in hopes of wholesome Italian food and we certainly were not disappointed. The restaurant is charming and quaint, while the staff is very attentive and happy to serve. We ordered a pizza and a fettuccine--both were very tasty and fairly priced. We intend to come back and try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Delivery .Regina has been around a long  time. Its been around since I was a kid when lived around that area . I live downtown King and Church and was pleasantly surprised that they delivered all the way down here a few years ago . Always nice people when you place an order. I always enjoyed the Pizza,  Regina Special and have ordered sandwiches and pastas from here as well never disappoints . Always good food and the delivery is actually quick . They are still around for one simple reason....... the food is good !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Lasagna was mushy and the pizza lacking. Generally too salty.  Guess you can't trust all yelp reviews.   Service wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Had a good delivery experience a while back and decided we had to try dining in. I don't recommend steak for delivery. At least I hope it was overlooked because it was delivered.   Went back last night and the food was so delicious.   Food: We had seafood linguine and clam linguine, both with tomato sauce instead of the white wine sauce. The cold cut antipasto with cheese and veggies was the perfect size for two. Would be small for more people and items would have to be cut to be shared. We loved the linguine pescatore so much that we cleaned the plate and barely any sauce was left.   Drinks: Cosmo was ok. Caesar was watery and left untouched after a couple of sips. I don't like to waste but it was mainly water so not much of a waste. They have one of my favourite wines (ripasso valpolicella), so cannot complain there.  Service: our server was attentive, picked up cues even while subtle (menus down, half empty water glasses, catching of eyes for longer than a second, etc.). I'd try to be in his area of returning. The older gentleman was a little gruff. Asking us to take our napkins so he can remove the wine glasses before our food even arrived. As though it would be such a bother to wash them if they were touched."}
{"text":"My mother was Calabrese, and these guys are from Calabria. The food here was authentic, delicious, and high quality. The owners accommodated our large party, and the only reason I held back the fifth star was because they were a little short-staffed and service suffered a little. But I would go back for the great food, prepared by the owners themselves.   We had a couple pizzas to start, fried calamari and shrimp, caprese salad, and family style Caesar and house salads. All outstanding. Of the 16 people dining, 10 grew up in an Italian family and the others have Italian in-laws. EVERYONE loved their entrees. As long as the same Paesani are in the kitchen cooking with Calabrian love, I highly recommend Regina."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian pizza! Fresh and pipping hot when they delivered it. We also ordered the gnocchi with rose sauce but the portion was so small for $15. Really disappointed about that. Overall awesome experience with them:)"}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the service to the ambience was just fantastic!  With a reservation for 10 people, Regina's was the perfect place for a little family gathering. We started off with antipasto platters that were the perfect way to start off a meal. Tomato & buffalo mozzarella of course, grilled zucchini, meats and cheeses and a few other delightful starters.   Main meals - what a selection! Every pizza and pasta you could possibly dream of - and they're great about customizing orders. You're able to chose your preferred sauce for pasta (which is always a nice treat), and everything we ordered was raved about. Spaghetti and clams, gnocchi, manicotti, lasagna... everyone cleaned their plate! Lots of sharing happening too...  There was fresh bread, our waters were constantly filled, the staff was beyond lovely, and it has a lively but quaint atmosphere. It was really the perfect place to catch up with family over food, wine and a few Birra Moretti's.   Main dishes ranged from $11 - $16 ish, salads in the $7 range, apps the same. Reasonably priced considering the tastiness!  Only disappointment - Only tiramisu for dessert. But they came with fresh blueberries, strawberries, and were devoured as well.  Also street parking is limited - there is a Metro just East of Regina's, but it's $10 for non-grocery shoppers!"}
{"text":"Parked right by the Paintlounge, my friend and I stopped in for a bite before one of our painting workshops.  Just by the sight of the white table clothes and cloth napkins, I knew that it would be a bit of a splurge.   Pros: - Pretty environment. Each table is lined with a white table cloth, and cutlery set neatly lined up. The restaurant opens up to the street, so you get the fresh air and sunshine streaming in. You feel strangely fancy eating here. - Food tastes good, and all the ingredients seem fairly fresh. I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, which had prosciutto, artichokes and mushrooms. I found the artichokes to be very fibrous and difficult to eat, however.  Cons: - Pricey. A small pizza was$16.95. While my friend and I split the pizza and the bill, it was a particularily light lunch  - Service and speed. The pizza took a long time to come, and additionally it wasn't piping hot. It was for some reason.. lukewarm, even though my friend and I were the only diners at that restaurant at that time.  This place was very convenient lunch spot considering it is right next to Paintlounge. However in future I am planning on exploring the other pizzeria options in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday, after a long week. My girlfriend got the Spaghetti Carbonara (My cooking specialty, but I wasn't too offended) and I opted for the Gnocchi in Cream Sauce with Gorgonzolla.   The Pasta was good and the sauce was very creamy and strong, which I like. The Gnocchi, while not the best I've had, was certainly passable. The Portions were a good size and a fair price."}
{"text":"This gets 2 based on the salad and the nice people who work there, but overall the food was not good. Not sure why this place got number 2 on yelp when I pulled up restaurants in this area. Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was watery and tasteless and the meatballs had zero flavor as well. I ate half of a meatball before I called it quits."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery - the food came fast and the service over the phone and from the delivery person was spot on. The tiramisu was excellent, but the spaghetti polpette was a little disappointing. It tasted *good* but barely had any sauce. The meatballs were yummy, and the bread also good and fresh, but because there was no sauce and no butter, I'd put it at 3 stars, if not for the service and dessert!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday last weekend.   One thing to note: if I go to an Italian restaurant, it has to be a \"real\" Italian restaurant, where they don't smother everything in cheese. I am one of those pathetic souls who is allergic to dairy.  That being said, the service was a little slow, but tolerable because we were definitely enjoying each other's company, we were a table of 12 and the place was packed. Also, the owner/manager looks like the spitting image of Robert DeNiro. I'm not sure why that makes it okay but it does.  I had the meat ravioli, DELIGHTED that it didn't have any cheese in it. Seriously, this is the first time in 5 years I've had ravioli. And it was DELICIOUS and filling!! The rest of the table had pizzas and pastas, and they were all very pleased with them.  The atmosphere is friendly, busy without being claustrophobic and bright. A great place for a fun dinner with friends."}
{"text":"The very friendly owner really is Robert DiNiro's doppleganger!   Popped in with a party of eight for lunch on a Saturday Afternoon.  Was surprised that we were the only people in the place, but it was Saturday after Good Friday and we were early, around noon.    We were looking for a quick lunch, so ordered a couple of pizzas and salad, and the pizzas were excellent, rivalling anything we've had in Brooklyn & Manhattan.  Thin crust, great sauce, yum!  Everyone in our party agreed that the cheese pizza was the best, the mark of a great pizza place.    We'll definitely make a return trip here and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Service was terrible--only 2 waiters for the entire restaurant. Ordered veal chop medium and it came well done, tasteless and tiny. Requested  2 orders of very spicy pasta - they forget to make the orders spicy. Asked for no mussels on the pasta - the pasta came with mussels. Not once did the waiter follow up to ask, \"how's everything?\" Well, I'm telling you now, it was TERRIBLE and I'll never go back. College Street and other streets in Toronto are full of so many other wonderful Italian restaurants. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Quite a few reviews echo my feelings on this place so I won't go into a long review. FOOD: I ordered the Penne Regina and I loved it. The portion was a large size and I could've easily taken half of it home. However, I am a pig and ate it all. SERVICE: The service sucked. Our waiter took forever to take our orders, forever to bring bread to the table, forever to bring our order and then we sat at our table, wondering if he would ever come over with the bill. Eventually we got up from the table and walked to the front; as we did, they had our bill ready. I guess we were just supposed to know that we should pay at the front.  I would probably get take-out from here if I was craving that pasta again but I doubt I would go here willingly to eat again."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Regina for a pizza a few nights ago. The atmosphere is nice and the service was very good. We ordered a 16 inch pizza that was perfect for four and tasty. We ordered 1-liter carafe of red wine (the one that isn't available by the bottle) and it was okay. Everything was quite good until I ordered a round of sambuca. We ended up leaving most of it as it had a strange taste and was unpleasant on the palate. It was not as syrupy as sambuca that we've had elsewhere. That was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here last night. We were very lucky to get a last minute reservation--we called around 4 and they had a spot available at 8:15pm. I'm glad we called because this is a small and busy restaurant. We sat at the only open table and the servers were obviously very busy. All the tables around us were groups of people and it was fairly loud. The environment was inviting, very clean, with white table cloths and paintings on the walls. My husband had a negroni and I got a 1/2 liter of pinot grigio. Service was a little slow but they were busy. They brought out a bread basket and butter with our drinks. Our water glasses stayed full & our salads came out very quickly! Salads were fresh and crisp and dressed perfectly. For our entrees my husband ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken and I had the spaghetti carbonara. Everything was delicious! They really know what they're doing here. At the end of our meal, when the restaurant had cleared a bit, the owner came over and introduced himself. He told us a little about the restaurants history and his family. He was so proud of this family establishment. We told him we would be back when we visit Toronto next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Great home made food, and service was quick and super friendly. The prices were super reasonable too."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident while trying to get into Isabel across the street. . I was surprised to see the place nearly empty on a Saturday night but decided to give it a shot anyways. Let me say I didn't regret. The menu is very basic but the food tasted good and they have large portions. The server was super nice and attentive.  Prices were more than reasonable especially considering their portion sizes (it was really a lot!)"}
{"text":"Great, simple Italian food.  It's the only place we'll confidently take my wife's grandma when she comes to town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past year but my last experience compelled me to finally write a review... The food her is incredible and the staff have always been nice and efficient.  This time around I ordered the Penne Regina. I should have known any dish named after the restaurant had to have been good. But before our mains even arrived they gave us some fresh bread and it was so soft it tasted like cake. I don't usually fill up on bread before a meal but this stuff was hard to resist. Then my penne came and it was so rich and full of flavour. It was drenched in creamy rose sauce with chicken, eggplant and zucchini I believe. I don't usually get full but half way through this dish I began slowing down... Maybe it was the bread.  Definitely an ideal place to hit up for some Italian cuisine when in Little Italy. Two or three people came in for takeaway while we were there and they seemed like old friends of the restaurant. And just before we left a family walked in and the kitchen staff came out and gave them kisses like in the Godfather. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant the other day since its an area I visit often.   Sat down at a table and the first thing we noticed was how the utensils and plates didn't feel properly cleaned. My wife's wine glass still had red wine that was dried up and definitely not cleaned. We and another table were the only ones in the restaurant so it wasn't busy.   We told the waitress and while she gladly took it away, not even an apology. Not a great first impression.  I ordered the lasagne which was decent and fairly large. Could likely share it if you got something lighter like a salad with someone else. Server brought grated cheese over but at these places that seem authentic Italian, I would've expected freshly grated parm. (Maybe that's not the norm in Italy?)  At the time we paid the bill, I asked for change from a $20 since we were splitting with a few friends. They had no $5 bills they could provide. This wasn't late at nite, this was 6pm on a weekday.   All in all, not a pleasant experience and figure a restaurant that's been around a bit longer would've avoided these minor mistakes."}
{"text":"Been to Regina a few times with friends and I have never left disappointed. The food was good and the staff is always friendly and prompt! The Penna Al Salmone was wonderful. Great place!"}
{"text":"We returned once again to Regina this past weekend, and it has not changed a bit.The Lasagna is the best Ive ever eaten, it melts in your mouth and is full flavour.  My guests loved their spaghetti. I couldn't be happier with the meal and considering its quality and the lovely service we received, they should be charging twice as much as they are.  This restaurant is my only choice when it comes to wonderful Italian food."}
{"text":"Ti adore! I absolutely loved this place. What a terrific small family run restaurant. This is exactly what Yelp is for!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite local restaurants! Totally family run and I've been going her for a while, the make everything there and it doesn't taste like Rago like most Italian restaurants. Portions are huge and its at a great price. The staff is always friendly and honestly it's the best bang for the buck when craving Italian in Toronto"}
{"text":"My friend had recommended this place to me, although I live in Richmond hill myself and few friends made the drive just to visit reginas and it was well worth it!! Pizza was so fresh, and it was obvious how fresh and homemade the pasta was. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Classic old-school Italian place.  Amazing pizzas and pastas.  Where else can you still get homemade meatballs, lasagnas and gnocchi?  They even deliver which is great because I don't always feel like going out."}
{"text":"I gotta give big props to Regina Pizzeria.   The pizza here is just absolutely amazing. I'm not even a big pizza fan but this place makes me go crazy (in a good way). I'm salivating right now just typing about it.  If you dine in, the pizzas are brought out on the big pedestal-type silver serving platters. The flavour of the pizza is just WOW...I don't know if it's the sauce, the crust or what but each mouthful is just delicious. I usually get the one made with grilled chicken and various grilled veggies (eggplant, red peppers) and sundried tomatoes.  Pizzas are hefty in size, not thin crust but not quite deep dish either, a medium size serves two hungry eaters."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, had to add salt, pepper, or hot pepper oil to almost everything. Service was extremely slow both for food and when we asked for things. We asked for our check and it took well over 10 min to get to us (and this isn't a big restaurant)."}
{"text":"Terrible service (felt like we were an inconvenience to the waiter), mediocre food, and over priced. There are far better Italian restaurants out there so don't waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"When I got into this restaurant I felt like I was really in Italy, that's awesome because you are looking for that when you want real italian food...Yes, REAL ITALIAN FOOD!  There is a lot to choose from the menu, and everything I tried was good! The pesto pasta was amazing, the garlic bread was very good, the ravioli my friend got was also super yumme...   This is what I'm looking for when I want Italian food!   The portions are good, not huge, and the price is good as well.  I really can't wait to go back.  The waiter was very nice, I want to say he was italian? (That made my visit even more real :) )  So, if you are looking for great italian food with an italian experience, don't hesitate to come here!!!!"}
