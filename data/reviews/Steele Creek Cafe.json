{"text":"I got the fish platter with two sides.Food is simply disgusting. Fish no taste. Who can go wrong with french fries?...Please do not order the mac and cheese. I am not sure what that mush was but it was not mac and cheese. When I tasted it caused gag reflexes. Not return to this place."}
{"text":"Cannot complain about this place. The food is always consistent, the staff is always friendly/helpful, and the portions are great for the price. By far one of the best lunch choices in the S. Tryon area!"}
{"text":"Since I work nearby this place, I go there regularly. They are quick and food is great and the price is very reasonable. I've never been disappointed with their food.  Philly cheese steak sub is the best!! You can also order double meat and double cheese on it. It is so delicious. Breakfast menu is also highly recommended. My family go there on Sat or Sun mornings for hot breakfast and my kids love them. Best diner in the area!!"}
{"text":"Great home cooked meals.  Chicken sandwiches and Homemade Meatloaf are excellent!  Service was great also.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the meatloaf platter with sliced tomatoes and lima beans. The meatloaf was a horrible combination of processed meat patties and some type of red sauce that sort of tasted like a runny marinara sauce. However, the lima beans were great."}
{"text":"Normally order ahead and get it to go. Orders are always right, and they even get the \"no ice\" specification correct! Which not many do. Their food is good, definitely satisfies my lunch cravings and it's ready within 10-15 minutes (of course this can vary). It's clean and they don't have you waiting. I recommend the pita cheeseburger."}
{"text":"My family eats here quite often. The staff is friendly and the food is always good. Our faves are the Calabash Shrimp plate & the Gyro plate. We've never had a veggie there that we didn't like. The kids really like the mac & cheese. The portions are generous & the prices are very reasonable. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"So I was in the area decided to stop in and have breakfast. I ordered a pancake and two scrambled eggs. First off let me say that my meal came up to 8 dollars and the woman failed to notify me that there was a special for 6 dollars for the same exact thing I ordered ( I over heard another lady telling another customer about the special which was 2 pancakes 2 eggs one meat=6 bucks) like why didn't she offer me that to save a couple bucks but whatever. Poor customer service. Next my eggs were wayyyyy undercooked for scrambled eggs with cheese. How does that happen? The food wasn't that good. Very bland. Needless I won't return."}
{"text":"Just picked up 2 greek chicken salads for lunch.  When the order was called in the person who took the order did not mention that the chicken was an extra $4 per salad.  With drinks, the bill was $26+ for 2 salads.  This is absolutely ridiculous and we will not go there again because after calling and complaining all they said was \"sorry.\""}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  I have lived in the area close to 4 years and last weekend was my first trip to SCC.  I loved it.  I had the \"Carolina\" burger with onion rings.  YUM!  The onion rings were homemade.  My burger was cooked perfect.  I believe the only comment for improvement would be their sweet tea.  It tasted instant and not brewed.  I love a good Southern brewed sweet iced tea."}
{"text":"I already gave this restaurant a good review and then Yelp saw I visited and asked me to review it again. It must be because I went back for lunch the second day in a row. It was that good. As a visitor from out of town, it was nice to find a place with a local feel. Good food, quick service,  and worth a second stop. Avoid the fast food restaurants and support a local establishment. The food just tastes better."}
{"text":"The management sucks at this place. I saw him empty a small trash bag into a larger one just to save a trash bag. I asked for my food to be placed into seperate countainers because I dont like my food wet with greens juice and he told me that that would be extra. the Chicken Wings were red inside and cold. And when you complain he acts like he don't care. I will not be back to this dump ever again.   gunny usmc ret"}
{"text":"I work 2 miles from Steele Creek Cafe.  I really can't afford to eat out every day, but honestly, it is worth the $ to go here, not only for the food, but for the customer service.  I really don't mind going a little out of my budget, just to walk into this place and feel their hospitality. The entire staff is always friendly, sweet and welcoming.  It's a great atmosphere.  And the food?  Divine.  Period.  Never had a bad meal here.  Best diner I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout breakfast with my colleagues and there was a white/gray hair in my food 0_o  Never ever again will I eat here! Eww! Hair nets, clean hands and proper sanitation is so very important. I hope no one else has an experience like that here."}
{"text":"Three visits in, all for lunch, and the food is more than decent for the price. Large portions too. Reminds you of eating in a country cafeteria. The cashiers are pleasant to speak with and genuinely nice."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star I would . Not impressed at all . The Waffle House is a step up from this ."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.....if the staff was a little friendlier it would great!  A little kindness goes a long way."}
{"text":"Wonderful comfort food just as momma and granny made it. Excellent prices for the quality as well as quantity."}
{"text":"Excellent food quality..... so great!! New look renovated inside.... Always kind services with smiles...."}
{"text":"Unassuming place, clean, friendly staff. Order @ the counter & food is delivered to the table.  Good portions served hot and tasty. See popcorn shrimp & breakfast special pics!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever- will not be back. The manager, jun, is that most rude and unhelpful man ice ever dealt with. The fish had no taste and the fries were cold. Yuck."}
{"text":"I had hoped this neighborhood cafe would be a surprising gem in Steele Creek. After all, if I can support local, independent businesses AND get a good meal, that's a win. Alas, Steele Creek Cafe, like most of Steele Creek, just didn't wow me.   I ordered the breakfast special, a typical eggs, meat, bread combo. The eggs were okay (hard to screw up scrambled eggs). The sausage was dry and lacked flavor. The huge serving of hash browns was bland, and the biscuit was so-so.   To be fair, the cafe is on Westinghouse Blvd. and caters to the hard-working blue collar folks who work in this industrial area of Southwest Charlotte, where a good values trumps gourmet dining. Still, I grew up on greasy spoons and all-night diners, and I was hoping for more of a warm-you-up, fill-you-up meal...not good for you, but oh so good. My quest for a true Steele Creek eatery with character continues."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot post workout on Saturdays. The food is cooked to order and the staff is awesome.   I'm a big eater. So my favorite meal is the breakfast special that I add two extra eggs to (for a total of 4 eggs) and hash browns. The biscuits that come with the breakfast special are delicious. But, get there early, because they're made fresh and they'll run out if you wait too long.  I can't say enough kind words about the women who work the front counter at this place. They work their tails off and do an excellent job. Plus, they put up with us rowdy CrossFitters every Saturday and never bat an eye. The kitchen staff is really friendly too. You can see them diligently working through the pass through window and they often smile and wave at us regulars.  When my parents came to visit I didn't take them to tupelo honey or any of those overdone and high priced places. I took them here, for an authentic Charlotte experience."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast special. 2 eggs cooked your way, your choice of meat, toast or biscuit, hash-browns or grits. I would give them 5 stars but I always request my hash-browns to be cooked \" softly\" but they never honor my request."}
{"text":"Went at dinner, they were not busy but they were very attentive.  The service was very friendly and fabulous.  They have so many side choices.  I tried the onion rings (which were outstanding) and the fried squash (which was fresh and fantastic).  They had a ton of choices all over the Americana map.  I tried the jumbo fried shrimp and they were also very good.  I didn't find many health food conscious choices... but to be honest I sort of fell off the wagon once I saw all of the delicious fried goodness they were offering.  They may have these choices.  Hot food, outstanding service, and an extremely reasonable price.  It seemed to me (from Cincinnati) to be one of the few local businesses that were not a chain.  Support your local business and give Steele Creek a whirl, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've ordered breakfast and lunch here on more than a few occasions and every time it's wrong. I don't order anything crazy, usually the special for breakfast but it never fails that it's always wrong. Sometimes the order is to go so by the time I've opened it up it's too late to say anything. I've remedied that by now just not going there."}
{"text":"If I could give them like 2.5-2.8 stars I would, they're not quite 3 stars. I've been here several times. The menu has quite the variety and is relatively cheap. The thing I have gotten the most frequently is a breakfast special. Typically, I get eggs,hash browns  and bacon. With their eggs, they just lay cheese on top if you ask for it... not cool. Their hash browns are not good and I LOVE HASHBROWNS so this is sad for me. Their French fries also leave much to be desired. Most recently, I ordered a grilled chicken salad from here. The chicken lacked seasoning but the portion size is good. They are pretty fast with pick up orders. I've heard good things about their Philly cheesesteaks, shrimp salads and pancakes. This place is reliable just don't expect it to wow you unless you're STARVING."}
{"text":"Was very simple, stopped in for breakfast. Food was ok and the staff was very friendly. Service was quick and food was hot."}
{"text":"Four stars for the greens not cooked with fat back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Local favorite. Wife and I been coming here for years. Breakfast special is my fav!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for lunch. The vegetables are a little watery but the fried chicken is really good. I didn't like their cornbread because it was icky sweet (like a cake)."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly I hate only giving it 2 stars, but... The food was lackluster.  It was freshly cooked, but lacked flavor. The beef tips over rice had no sauce so it was dry. The phili cheese steak was just okay. You could taste more egg than cheese in the macaroni and cheese. On a high note, the onion rings were great. It looks like many reviews were for breakfast, maybe their breakfast is better."}
{"text":"Welcome to the home of southern comfort, huge portions, great flavors and friendly service... Oh, did I mention how cheap it was?!?!  My fiance and I came here to grab breakfast before my meetings, and we had no idea on how it was going to go. I got the home special for 5 bucks, and my fiance got a mix and match of stuff.  Tell'ya what, they gave us a HUGE serving plate full of eggs, grits, toast and meat, and let me tell you, everything was delicious! Sadly we could not finish it all, so we took our coffees (free re-fills) and hit the bricks. Total tab, about 12 bucks!  My future head quarters is right down the street, and you can bet your sweet southern style tail feather I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a liver-mush omelet and hash browns.. Very delicious, fast service, clean establishment, and nice people.."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great place to spot for a quick, good breakfast. I love to come in here because they are quick, friendly and the amount of food for the price is perfect! Sweet tea is good but my favorite breakfast item is their toast. I don't know why but it is always perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way to doing errands for some home-style cooked breakfast. I was extremely pleased. it's not haute cuisine, but it's also far from the chain restaurants and fast food eateries around town.  I ordered a Western omelet with hash browns and dry toast and that's what was on my tray when my number was called. Good size, with plenty of cheese and fillings. A big pile of delish food where you can actually sit down for a bit, read the paper and get change back from a $10.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Anytime you pull into a restaurant parking lot at lunch and it's packed with utility trucks you can bet two things; one, you are going to get a lot of food and two, it's going to be fairly priced. This place is no different.   They have a great selection of food ranging from soup and salad to fried chicken. The place is clean, the staff is friendly and I was out of there in less than 40 minutes.  It is worth checking out if you want some good old home cooking, only out at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Just food; nothing special. My ham was sour; the bacon tasted like bland paper. My husbands salmon was overcooked. Safe to say we won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Good home cook southern food. The cashier was very nice. Clean restaurant. Will definite come again."}
{"text":"Found a quick little breakfast place near me. Wanted a big breakfast but didn't feel like cooking this am. I purchased the breakfast special for $4.99 which was a great deal with it i had grits,eggs,two turkey sausages,hasbrown, and toast! The emloyees were super nice, i ordered my food to go i don't think its one of those places i would actually sit down and eat in, good thing is i can tell apparently they have alot of regulars that come order breakfast they knew alot of customers by name as they entered. Great deals! Great people! Great customer service!"}
