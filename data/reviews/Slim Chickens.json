{"text":"This place has amazing customer service. We went on a Sunday to drive thru and pick up some food for our kids. We planned to eat at another restaurant that has food my kids aren't into. We placed our order and when we tried to pay, they told us that it was \"Kids Eat Free\" day. We were floored. They didn't charge us a penny. We tried to pay and they just wouldn't have it. We will definitely be back and order enough for the whole family! Plus...the food was really good too!"}
{"text":"My little brother and his buddy told me this place was better than Raising Canes. I'm a huge fan of Canes mostly for their sauce. I asked those guys why they would want to eat skinny chickens... I mean what kind of name is that?! I tried it and I liked it. They have way more choices as far as sauce goes, and the entire menu in general than Raising Canes. I got the Slims plate and decided to get slim sauce and gravy for my dipping sauces. The slim sauce was disappointing to me. I liked the gravy with the toast- which was not as thick and delicious as Canes. The fries were much better than Canes. They were seasoned and delicious. The chicken was good, but not crispy like I'm used to. Overall everything was delicious... just not as delicious as chicken in Canes Sauce in my opinion. They have a better menu than Canes and to be fair I think that if I tried something that Canes didn't offer on their menu (which is like 80% less options than Slim Chickens) I would be leaving a much better review.  Ill be back to try some wings or a salad, maybe some fried pickles or fried okra ( I love that this is an option- just hope it is as good as my Grandma Campbell made)"}
{"text":"I saw this place just pop up so I figured I'd try it out. I walked in and was greeted by both employees and management which was a nice feeling. The staff was courteous and respectful, and offered plenty of great suggestions! I ended up getting a pretty wide variety; the 5 & 5 plate, fried pickles, and a strawberry cheesecake jar dessert. The food came out fast and it was delicious! I was very satisfied with the quality of food used in my meal. All in all, I had a great dining experience at Slim Chickens and will certainly be back in the future."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Yeah. It'll be 6 months before I give it another shot. Mediocre tenders, wings, fries and toast. Food was 3 stars, service was 2. As another poster said, very young staff. If they could grab the young staff service playbook from Chick-fil-A, they'd be WAY ahead of the game. The food was ok, the restaurant was empty yet the garbage cans inside were full...  And there was an employee talking on his cell phone near the dumpsters. The laughable comment of the visit was \"Wonder what he's doing out there...  It's clearly not taking out the garbage.\""}
{"text":"Okay. Good stuff first.  Staff was friendly and service was fast. Good music. (Blues).  The not so good.  I got the,6 wing plate.   Wings were tiny.  Very pricey for what you get. The were half wings.  One was even a half of half.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. There sauce is fake and disgusting along with their Wings are a damn Joke in the book. There fried pickles are way too salty.....  This place needs to go back to where they came from!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try & it was ok. Chicken tenders were kinda bland. The slim sauce was different & not real flavorful. My daughter had wings with buffalo sauce & she really liked them. Fried pickles & mushrooms were yummy.  If I come back, I will try the wings."}
{"text":"I work at the Wells Fargo right next to It and ran over to grab some food for me and my co workers. We have been so excited for it to open and wasn't disappointed at all!! The staff, especially management, was soooo nice and welcoming!! The food was SO good. It was such amazing service and we all can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, accommodating service, and a clean restaurant. We'll definitely be back! I ordered the sandwich and they let me sample the cayenne sauce before ordering to see if it was too spicy for me. We also ordered tenders, and I love that it is real pieces of chicken and not over processed meat."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT !! the chicken tenders here are so much better than raising canes!  The chicken sandwhiches are great also!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Slim Chickens, we had great food and great service. Of course the whole family enjoyed the variety in sauces and sides to pair with juicy hot chicken strips. Oh and the manager Jeremy came by our table to check on us, what a super friendly and knowledgeable employee to have. All in all a great experience,  it's hard to find these days. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great and friendly service!! Juicy chicken tenders with a light breading- not soggy! Sauces were amazing I had the ranch and the slim sauce The macaroni was also so delicious!  Cons: Expensive- like pretty expensive for a \"fast food\" Fried pickles were extremely salty- almost inedible and only have a large portion French fries were the kind I liked but they were cold which caused them to get stale like and soggy"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, thought it was amazing. Cayenne ranch chicken sandwich was delicious, the fried pickles were perfect. Restaurant itself was clean, staff was friendly/helpful and there were plenty of tvs on the walls."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food!!! Will definitely come again! Tried the cayenne sandwich and 3 chicken entree. The desserts in a jar look amazing for next time."}
{"text":"The chicken tastes pretty good but the fries were loaded with msg. I got a killer headache and stomachache after. Also the fries have skins. No Bueno. Canes is better, both chicken and fries. Canes lightly salts their fries rather than dump msg seasoning on them - so much better and no skins.   The Texas toast was terrible. A thin piece of regular greasy bread thrown on a grill. And we didn't get any Cole slaw. Waaaaaahhhhhh. Canes gives you tasty Cole slaw with a meal.   I'll stick to canes."}
{"text":"It was good. Not great. I wanted it to be great. The place was pretty clean, as it should be just having been constructed. The staff was friendly and presentable. I got a basket, chicken strips and fries. The chicken itself was straight up B+.  It could have been hotter.  The garlic-Texas toast was deflated or smashed and cold.  The fries were eh, basic frozen fries.  They also would have been better hot.  The dipping sauces, I had spicy bbq(tasty), and gravy (congealed, cold, white blob of paste), so 1 for 2 on that.  The music was too loud to talk over.  At the prices they charge it needed to be perfect.  It was good, not great.  I would not drive from the north side of urbana to the south side of champaign for it again, but if i was in the area, why not?"}
{"text":"Way better than Canes! The chicken strips are all chicken and not breaded like Canes. Everything has been delicious even the dessert jars were the best. Service is so friendly and patient with you. All around five stars!!"}
{"text":"I would say the place is so so. The food is ok the price is to high for what it is. we have been here 2 times and both times they are out of something that we tried to order. The kitchen area is dirty. But for having 5 employees standing at the register talking you would think the place would be clean. NOT"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Don't let the size of the chicken fingers fool you. They are so meaty and juicy that I could only eat 2. At Cane's it looks like your getting a bigger piece of chicken but your not it's all bread. Here it's lightly battered and all chicken. Look out for coupons you will get some great deals. Desserts are awesome they come in mason jars and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a handful of times,and everytime i am so pleased with it. Not only the great quality of chicken and portions,but by far the service. Everytime i feel welcomed and appreciated. The manager dave is phenomenal with customers. They all have great attitudes. Never have i had a bad experience. Dave always on top of everything! Today samantha and dave went above any beyond when i had a minor problem with my order. But they went rhe extra mile and fixed with no problem.  On top of making sure to come by our table a couple of times to check on us and to make sure everything was ok and to apologize for mess up. I will say it here and i said it to them. For it to be considered kind of a \"fast food\" establishment  they have the best service in CU,and i can count on better service here than other places that is supposed to be a 5 star restaurant where your bill for 2 people is $40+. By far exceeds expectations and exceeds service above any other restaurants. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Newly opened location - seems pretty clean... people on the register do not seem welcoming, young millenials not happy to work :(   Kyleigh clearly did not want to be there - she seemed bored.    They offer a variety of dipping sauces - meh.  See photo - lame!   The chicken does not appear to be seasoned at all, a good chicken place should not require a dip for you to enjoy.  Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Smallest chicken tenders, they are basically the size of a 2 chicken nuggets. I understand it a new location but it's obvious that the staff is severely under trained. They kept making mistake after mistake with my order. Had to wait over 15 minuets for the 5 piece tender meal. The sauces are not even filled up, they fill the sauces 1/3 of the cup giving you almost no sauce for your food. I had to ask for more sauce and the lady rudely told me that they don't fill them up all the way so they don't leak. Their \"Texas toast\" was a joke. Their toast is just a overly toasted  smushed piece of sandwich bread.   And the manager was just watching hockey on the tvs instead of helping his staff when it got busy. He was just barking orders while watching tv."}
{"text":"Less than 1 star the chicken was raw I went and I spoke with the manager he said it is a veins which is not true because I work at restaurant and I know what is raw chicken is and he didn't even care and he said I  appreciate that u told me and he didn't even apologize ..I got so mad and I left the restaurant and it was my first and last time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have chicken tenders and wings! I got the 3 for 3 which is 3 chicken tenders and 3 chicken wings. You get a choice of two sauces or can substitute for a side! You can also pick what sauce for you wings! But, to eat the wings the right way you have to get messy! ? They are great for just starting! Everything is updated aspaceaily the bathrooms! The only thing that I disliked was that there bathrooms are cold and smell like chicken! Anyways I would totally go back! They are amazing! I would suggest it to anybody that likes chicken !"}
{"text":"Slim Chickens was good! But, I thought it was too expensive. I payed $10 for what I thought was not worth it. Perhaps others like it, but it wasn't worth it to me. I will say Raising Canes is better..."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because it is so close to my office, and I was able to take my dog and chill at the patio and enjoy our time together, especially when it is getting hotter. I did not know what to expect when it comes to their food but with an open mind.  The chicken tenders and wings were great and delicious! It has been a long time for some great juicy and tender chickens. Yes as you can see that I was able to share my meal with my doggy. Of course, I would not share the amazing sources with him because he cannot have those sauces. I love the cayenne ranch and mango habanero. I am definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"After eating at this place I've done nothing but have been throwing up everything that I eat even if I drink water I can't hold it down . I believe I have food poisoning from this place . Never again will I eat at this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 & 3 plate, I would have probably given a score that agrees with the yelp average of 3 stars but given the price tag of the food that they sell here there is an expectation of a much higher quality than what was provided. The wings had no crisp to them with very little sauce, the tenders were also flavorless and about the size of a ring finger, and the fries had no seasoning or salt on them at all. The gravy was also pretty tasteless, but the ranch was good thankfully so I could at least have some flavor with the food... They say they cook it to order which I hope so because it took about 15-20 minutes to get all our food.  My friend who also was disappointed summed this place up the best, food court quality food (Overpriced and little flavor, but enough to fill you up until you're done shopping).  It looked interesting and the menu made the items look much better than they actually ended up being, I'd recommend saving your money and getting Chickfila or KFC long before going here."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Chicken didn't seem fresh...it was kind of chewy. Fries were lackluster, and the dipping sauces were ho-hum."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo salad.  Chicken was cold.  Chicken was so saturated with buffalo sauce that it made the salad portion of the meal inedible, lettuce was dripping with buffalo sauce and croutons were soggy.  Had a hard time finding the blue cheese crumbles.  Just ate the chicken.  The chicken was ok but as a salad it was a horrible salad.  Ordered Texas toast, just a thin slice of bread, thought Texas toast was supposed to be thick.  Toast tasted good. Probably will not go back based on this experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, hot & fast. But.. The lady that gave me my food had a septum ring. Gross!  Why do I want food from someone that looks like they have bugers coming out of their nose?!?  Disgusting!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the buffalo salad with grilled chicken and no croutons. I was dismayed about the lack of lettuce. It is a salad after all and there was not much to it. Amount of chicken was okay but as I ate I came upon some fried onions that were not on the menu as an ingredient and I can't have gluten so I have no idea if they were tossed in flour before frying. I definitely would of asked to keep these off had I known.  All in all I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Waited 30-40 minutes in 6 car deep drive thru. owner needs to assist managers with staffing. Sounds like it was a call in day."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time and loved it! The tenders were super fresh, and the service was great. Their iced tea is brewed, and they have sweet, unsweet, peach, and raspberry. The restaurant is spotless and modern inside. I want to keep coming back so I can try all of the different sauce options they have."}
{"text":"The chickens was ok. The sauces are good. The place is way overpriced for fast food. $14 for 10 tiny pieces of tenders is ridiculous."}
{"text":"its okay. better flavor then Canes and Chick-fil-a (any chicken is better then chick-fil-a) but if your really hungry you will need to double your order. the tenders are really nuggets and if you get a sandwich, you get one nugget that looks lost in the bun. other than the undersized portion everything was average. not in a hurry to ever go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food way better than canes and love the variety in the menu, sauces and everything else"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating at Slim Chickens and it doesn't compare to Canes. The chicken is good but not great, the breading is much better at Canes. The Texas toast at at Slim Chickens is very sad and was cold, my fries were cold also. The dipping sauces were good, but all around I was not satisfied. I won't be going back especially when I know I can go to Canes and everything will be fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru... I ordered BBQ sauce & buffalo. Went to the window, they got our order SO wrong multiple times. To the point where the manager said it was on him... even though our card was charged. They gave me ranch & some other red sauce. I got mac & cheese, when I ordered fries.  Should've just went the safe route at Chik-fil-A!!!"}
{"text":"A good FAST food chicken joint.   If you have time to sit they have tv inside   The choices on dips are over the top but to much isn't a bad thing"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night, loved it so much we came back for lunch today! Definitely our new go-to chicken place! The atmosphere, the menu, the service is great! Prices are reasonable and did I mention the desserts?? So cool & you get to keep the jar. Hope this new business gets plenty of local support because the food is tasty, especially the fried Okra!"}
{"text":"Heard they were open on their Facebook page and were excited to try them! Pulled in, parked, were greeted by an overwhelming number of teenage employees, then made it six feet in the door and were turned away. \"Do you have an invitation?\"  Uh, no...isn't this a restaurant?  \"Sorry, you have to have an invitation.\"  So, we left.  \"Do you want a menu anyway?\" As we walk away...  Uhm...how do I say this nicely? HELL NO. Will not be back...luckily there are a zillion awesome options just down the road. Posting this review from one of them now"}
{"text":"Great place, and not nearly as busy as Cane's. They also offer numerous sides, sauces, and have sandwiches, salads, wings, and chicken and waffles, plus desserts"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Slim Chickens and we were super impressed.  The food is fresh and chicken is very tender.  I wanted to try something different and went for the chicken and waffles! Loved it.  Very tender chicken and it was the perfect mix of sweet and salty. My husband and kids were all very happy with their meals as well.  Make sure to save room for dessert. We got the brownie dessert jar and were all fighting over every bite.  Very clean restaurant and loved the outdoor seating area.  Added bonus - they have a drive thru also! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This location is so great!! They're always polite and so friendly and my food is ALWAYS fresh! They have an employee named Alyssa and she is so so sweet and always has a smile"}
{"text":"If you are in a bind for last minute chicken order-go here. I had ordered a chicken tray from Walmart for about 20 kids and when I went to pick it up, they had nothing and definitely not enough chicken to fill it. We are a non profit theatre company and I wasn't sure who could fill the same order quickly for about the price we needed. The kids were expecting chicken since we try not to do pizza every show. In a panic I called Slim Chickens to see if they could possibly do a large order in 30 minutes or so. They assured me they could and were patient over the phone as I tried to figure out what to get. When I got to the restaurant, the food was ready and waiting. They also had made sure to give me plenty of ranch sauce and serving utensils. They were the best at fixing it in a hurry and I'm sure the kids will enjoy it more than Walmart chicken anyways."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and would come for the wraps and mac n cheese. I went in today and the menu has been shrunk. There are no more wraps. They just lost a customer. Why would you get rid of wraps? This baffles me."}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Plate today for lunch tossed in their buffalo sauce. I got it tossed because that is what they have recommended in their comments on other reviews.   The chick was good but the buffalo sauce had a taste similar to an Asian zing or Thai hot and spicy sauces I've had at other places. You can see the sauce is see through in a way. It threw me off a bit because I wasn't expecting a hint of sweet taste.  The fries were good and the entire meal filled me up without feeling over full which was nice.  I'll definitely try it again but I'll probably get a different sauce."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but also unique for this part of the country. I would eat it again. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town! Definitely beats raising canes and Lolos chicken and waffles. Our new favorite restaurant, the service is always great and the food is amazing. The chicken and waffle plate, the sweet tea and the hungry plate are our favorites. The have great sauces, and the chicken is always hot, fresh and moist!  Have eaten here at least 10 times now :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here randomly and grabbed their chicken sandwich. It was amazing! So much better than Canes or Chick fil A. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through very skeptical.  Not a big menu - which is really not a bad thing.  I chose the grilled chicken buffalo ranch wrap and mac n cheese and sweet tea.  The price is not that bad considering it includes a side and a drink.  I was wondering how the mac n cheese would be by the time I got back to my office.  To my surprise it was really good.    The chicken wrap was spicy hot and pretty good.  I want to try the other wrap they have on the menu.  Super friendly drive through worker too!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today for the first time.  I ordered the 3 and 3 (3 tenders, 3 wings, fries & Texas toast) which was more than enough food.  The chicken was excellent.  Everything is cooked to order and served piping hot to our table. The 3 and 3 is priced at $9.50 which includes a drink so that's not too bad.  They were super busy but we did not have to wait too long for our food."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Better options in town for less money. Sides tasted like they'd come from a very familiar \"country fried chicken\" fast food operation. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here about four times now. I love this place is so much better than Canes! Also love the Jar deserts they  are in a mason jar with their logo on the side. Super cool!  Love the Mac & Cheese!  I also love the Ranch and BBQ dipping sauces! Another reason why they beat out canes, multiple dipping sauces."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken wrap was horrible.  It was cold, two dry strips of over cooked chicken and lettuce"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken that I have ever eaten. I couldn't believe that it beats Cain's hands down. They have a lot of different of dipping sauces to from. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken was soggy and no flavor.  The fries were limp. Very disappointed as fried chicken is my favorite, should have known as I was there during the lunch hour and hardly anyone there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant seems to mirror Raising Cane's. The Slim Sauce can't hold a candle to the secret sauce at Cane's. The Texas toast is dry and a bit burnt, not worth the calories/carbs. The bathroom was filthy as well as the counter where you get drinks. The drink counter is barely stocked and the soda machine has been chirping for about 20 mins. Mind you the restaurant is not busy by any means, there are currently 19-20 people at a total of six different tables. This is busier than it was when we came in.   The staff are super nice and the atmosphere is nice.   When choosing between the two restaurants, I will always choose Cane's. Sorry Slim."}
{"text":"A good change of pace. Little bit of a wait,  but for fresh chicken it's worth it!!! I love their country gravy and the ranch is amazing too. Love the fact they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. The wings tasted old and there was barely any buffalo sauce on them. The fries were old as well and the chicken tenders were mediocre. They also gave me a piece of burnt toast that was limp and old. Only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the cayenne ranch is very good. Total waste of my money because I couldn't even eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"This is a follow up to a review I left 7 months ago. I mentioned that the wings were very tasty and favorable but small and over priced. Someone responded from the restaurant thanking me for the review and felt the wings were a good size and price. He was very nice nice though. At the time I mentioned I was used too getting larger wings for less than a dollar a piece.   Again though, I want to day they were very good and I will go back. I went to my wing spot in California, where I live. The wings have gone up but 20 large size wings was now $21.99 and you could include a half a rack of ribs for an additional $10. I just wanted to clarify that I was pretty close on my assessment.  I am not, in any way disparaging this restaurant. I will go back when I'm in town, which is asst least once a month. The food was good, very good and the service was good. The price was just a little higher than I am used too. But the fact that they responded to my review in a positive way says a lot about them."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders were bursting with tender white meat, nicely cooked but a tad dry.  All three of us agreed that the breading could have used more seasoning.  Not salt but seasoning."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, I ordered the cayenne chicken sandwich without the cayenne ranch and a side of fried pickles. They forgot and put the ranch on anyways, but whatever it happens. The chicken was way too thick (with barely any breading), but most of all the fried pickles tasted like I was pouring a jar of Morton's salt down my throat! OMG!!!! It was unbearable even when I dunked them in ranch, very sad. That's what ruined it for me :("}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new place. Clean, nice decor and music, with tvs around for viewing games. I ordered the chick plate, bothered the chicken and fries were great!   The toast I'm not a fan of , seemed barely toasted and soft meh. I'd see if there's a substitute for that. My bf had mac n cheese instead of fries dang good for fast food. We will go"}
{"text":"First two times were amazing! Fast drive thru, amazing tasting food (even though the price isn't favorable). I was really content until last night when the food they gave me tasted below good and it took forever to get the food in the drive thru even though it wasn't busy. If I was waiting that long I would expect my food to be fresh, 10 minutes at a fast food place. The fries were definitely soggy and cold which makes me wonder what they were doing. So 2/3 times were great which means a majority gets the 3 stars. I just don't know if I would recommend it again but I will probably give it another go and see what happens."}
{"text":"I had the 5 piece tenders plate. Some fingers were quite small. Chicken was cooked well but lacked any seasoning. Ranch sauce tasted cheap and srirachi sauce while spicy seems to be mostly ketchup. Fries were pretty good. Texas toast, well lets just say someone needs to go to Texas and do some investigating. Basically, it was plain grilled wonder bread. If there was butter on it you couldn't tell. The food here doesn't hold a candle to chick fil a or raising canes. Its not cheap either. I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a welcome concept in fast food.  Cute place with really friendly folks.  I came just to try the Fried Okra and was very pleased with the results.  Now I can have delicious Fried Okra at some Slim Chickens, or at some Dickies BBQ locations.  Nice!  Last year I could only find this delicious Southern dish at Cracker Barrel.  If only someone would offer up Fried Green Tomatoes and Jalapeño Hush Puppies then Arizona would be an even more awesome place to live!"}
{"text":"Who couldn't love this entire Southern concept?  Also, they have fried pickles, fried okra, and fried mushrooms.  Now they just need to add Hush Puppies and Fried Green Maters.  That would be Heaven!   Great staff!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be going down hill. Lately the chicken strips have been over cooked and really chewy. The last two sandwiches I ordered looked like they were just thrown together, the chicken breast was mainly breading and over cooked. The wings are something I still enjoy! Though sometimes they only fill their ramekins halfway with the dipping sauce or completely forget to give it to you. I enjoyed this place when it first opened but if all you're serving is chicken, then at least get it right."}
{"text":"Alright! Tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was very good. Overpriced for some chicken but good. Example for 3 chicken strips and 3 wings is $11.00 WOOOOOW!! get outta here! Anyway, I ordered 6 wings and fries. The whole order was hot and fresh just like it's supposed to be. Skin was crispy and the sauces were real good. Now for the most impressive part of my visit.  The wings were regular small wings - JUST LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. Not those big ass antibiotic fed chicken wings. Which should not be carried by ANY business INCLUDING grocery stores. If the management comes and reads THIS review, let me say thank you for this and please don't EVER compromise your quality in exchange for savings.  Wingstop AND Buff. Wild Wings did this and I don't eat at these establishments anymore PERIOD!!! So please keep doing what you've started, however; If I ever go and those wings are big, I will not go back and I've gotta BIG mouth and I'll tell anyone who will listen not to eat what I do not like. ;)"}
{"text":"First time trying slim chickens and I have to say the employees are nice and food was fresh and the taste of food was awesome the toast they serve is delicious I would highly recommend to all my friends and family"}
{"text":"I thought the tenders were good. I also got a side of potato salad and Mac and cheese both are very good. It's rare to find good potato salad at a restaurant that tastes fresh. I'll be back to try the wings and other sides."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders everrr!! They are so crunchy, full of flavor, and not at all soggy!!   Finally stopped in to try this place out, and I'm so glad I did. I went for the 5 piece chicken tender combo that included a drink, two pieces of toast, and french fries. My friend ordered the 6 piece chicken wings with buffalo sauce, and it came with one side, toast, and a drink. She opted for mac and cheese as her side.  The cashier was friendly and he seemed very happy to be there. We informed him the soda machine tasted bad and he gladly fixed it right away.   The dining area was very clean and organized but it was weirdly very warm. The bathroom was a bit dirty and it was freezing cold in there...   Our food tasted great! The mac and cheese was very creamy and cheesy and would order again. The toast was pretty bland and my least favorite. The french fries were crunchy and piping hot when they came out to us. The wings were not drenched in sauce which is what we like.. so yay.  We spent $19 for two combos.  The food was good and we will be back! Hey they also have a drive thru!  Students and teachers get 20% off on Tuesdays! They also have other offers!"}
{"text":"Service was very good, employees were very nice. Food was bland and overpriced. Canes by far wins in this category. It looked so good, new building new place for me... but very disappointed. There was no flavor cooked into the meats, when I say bland.. it's like they didn't season the meat before they fried it. Just fried it right out of the packaging. I wanted to love this place. But canes never fails me."}
{"text":"When they say \"Slim Chickens\", they mean it!  I got the buffalo chicken wrap, which consisted of literally only 3 chicken nugget sized pieces of chicken, and what seemed like a pound of lettuce.  Ended up throwing away half of it because all I had left was tortilla, buffalo sauce, and lettuce.  Kudos to the manager for stopping to ask how things tasted and offering to make things right, but with Chick Fil-A right around the corner, that's where I'll continue to take my occasional fast food business."}
{"text":"Went here and got fried tenders and grilled tenders.  I was shocked, but the deep fried tenders were not very juicy while the grilled ones were more juicy. The fries were good with great flavor. The mini oreo cheesecake desert was great! I would only order the grilled tenders next time. The ranch dip costs extra and it was barely filled. They jipped me!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and each time got the fried buffalo chicken wrap. It's so good. And the seasoning on the fries is yummy. I asked for the Slim Sauce for my fries today and it's tasty too. Yay! Definitely a nice change up from Chick-Fil-A."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this place and we were all very impressed.  My daughter got the tenders and waffles and that was 2 thumbs up.  My husband got the tenders and fries.  I wanted the salad and oddly enough at 11:30 AM on a Saturday they were already out? I don't know but I got the wrap with ranch and I was happy with that.  The fries are really good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly drive thru customer service! I live close and couldn't wait to try! I had 3&3 buffalo wings and tenders. Wings are just ok- nothing special and cooked too soft.  Tenders are good enough. Fried okra isn't bad!  My sister had fried pickles that she loved but aren't fried hard enough. Toast that comes with the combo is ehhhhhh!  Extremely plain! Dipping sauces are good !  I'll go back and give it another try"}
{"text":"Chicken is not bad, but tried it twice.  Bread is super super dry, no clue why they don't at least put butter on it.  Both times got chicken and waffles, both times no syrup included, and waffle was super soggy because they put butter on it so by the time you get home it's a soggy mess, I mean come on cups are like 3 cents.  Got buffalo wings with buffalo sauce, forgot buffalo sauce.  Got 5 piece wing, got only 4.  I mean come on."}
{"text":"Slim Chickens is a cool spot on Neil with a simplistic menu and some tasty options at a good price.  After some deliberation, I went with the 3 and 3 for $9.99 which included 3 chicken strips and 3 chicken wings.  They had quite a few sauce options but I opted for the cajun ranch and the gravy.    The wings were plump and juicy with a nice crispy exterior and a beautiful glistening white interior.  The meat slid off the bone and the cajun ranch was delicious.  The wing itself desperately needed seasoned, however.  It was cooked perfectly, but was rather bland.  The ranch saved it for sure.   The tenders were also very good and cooked to perfection.  Like their bone-in brethren, however, they also needed more seasoning.  The gravy was somewhat bland (tastes canned) so I ended up using the cajun ranch for these as well.    I chose the fries as my side (a difficult choice given the number of options) and they were pretty good (but also a bit bland).   Overall, I was pleased with the amount of food I got for the price and I ultimately enjoyed it all.  To get to the next level, this place needs to work on their seasoning both for the meat and the breading.  A little more salt also goes a long way!  Will try again.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru. The woman on the speaker was laughing and someone in the background was shouting. I thought it was an overseas call-center it was so loud and unprofessional. Gave my order and pulled to the window. Three people at the window and none of them would take my money. The woman that finally did had on a FILTHY shirt, and quoted me the wrong price from what I was told on the speaker. We cleared that up and she gave me my drink and everyone disappears. Another woman comes to the window, as I'm waiting for my food, and rattles off the order of the people behind me and their total. Umm..no. I told her I had the previous order and I was still waiting. So she tries to give me another drink. I declined and told her I already had the drink and I needed my food. To say it was a disorganized disaster is an understatement! I was underwhelmed with the food. I was also not asked how I wanted the chicken or what side I would like with my meal; according to their handout in my bag, there are choices. I was never asked, just served whatever would get me away quickest I'm sure so they could go back to being hooligans. Given the service I'm not likely to return, and I certainly don't recommend them."}
{"text":"My latest trip left a lot to be desired. I arrived at 9 pm an hour before closing time and all the chairs were up on tables for 'pre-closing.' There were minimal other seating options and what were available had not been cleaned after previous patrons. The staff seemed exasperated that anyone would dare come in an hour before closing asking for a meal. Others and I had to wait and ask where our order was almost 30 minutes later. Additionally, they had taken away almost all the drinks. Suffice to say I will not be heading back."}
{"text":"Kids loved their kids meals.  Like that they offer organic apple juice as the drink.  My wrap was lacking a little in flavor and had just a little too much lettuce.  Hubby and his friend liked their tender meals.  Overall we would come back."}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying! Fairly priced and all. My wife and I decided to stop in since it was new in our neighborhood to see what it was about. The chicken was pretty good and the customer service was pretty good as well the food was 4/5, not a ton of options but what they do have is pretty solid! I got the 3 buffalo wings and 3 chicken tenders and they did not disappoint. Definitely not a Buffalo Wild Wings status of wings but still good. The toast was really good especially dipped in the slim sauce! Love the options of dipping sauces as well! For sure try the cayenne ranch if you love spicy! We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I cane here it was a 5 star! I had the 3 x 3 and the tenders and wings were perfect ! Went again and it was AWFUL!(that's why my 3 star) The tenders were dry and chewy like they microwaved them to death before frying them. The wings were almost sauce less. Fries were meh . My daughter had a salad with grilled chicken on it, but had to pick it off because it had way too much pepper on it. Not sure if I'll come back or not. Plus as I was leaving a shaggy haired employee with a beard was walking around kitchen with no hair restraint  bleck"}
{"text":"This place is good if you like to wait a long time for your food. I'm pretty sure they grow the potatoes and hatch the chicken right after you order. I've given them a couple try's and I'm always there when there's no rush. The food is ok not the best but also not bad. The workers are usually just standing around too. I'm probably not going to go again unless I really want to wait a long time for my food."}
{"text":"I've been pretty excited to try Slim Chickens since I first heard that they were opening a location here in C-U. Tried it last night and was pleasantly surprised how good this place is.  First off, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Since we hadn't been there before we decided to let a few people order ahead of us while we looked at the menu. While we were looking, the manager came out and asked how we were and if we wanted any recommendations. He also thanked us for coming in. It's little interactions like this that can make an experience even better.  I got the Slim's Plate which includes 5 chicken tenders, fries, and Texas toast. The portions were huge! I was stuffed before I could finish all of my fries. I opted for the Slim's sauce and cayenne ranch as my two sauces, and the Cayenne ranch was unbelievably good. Although the price was a bit high, it's justified by the amount of food you get.  I loved the food and the overall experience of Slim Chickens. I think it's a fantastic addition to C-U and I'll surely be back to get my chicken fix."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Most of it was cold, but not bad. The employees were awful. One girl was texting when we came in, it took her a minute to even say anything to us. And then the same girl brought our food while she was literally talking on her cellphone. The boy who took our order knew nothing about the sauces and clearly didn't care about his job. My husband asked what kind of hot sauce they carried and he said \"hot sauce,\" and then recommended him to use ketchup for his tenders. They kept coming into the dining room, trying to rush us out by closing everything around us even though the door said the dining room closed at 10:00 and it was 8:30 during our visit. Good service goes really far and poor service ruins even the best of food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The wife and I went in last night to slims chicken. I had the Chyanne chicken sandwich with fries and wife had a slim salad . The Cayenne chicken was good the fries were a little warm not real hot but the service was very good. The wife like your salad, have plenty of chicken with croutons and it was just the right amount.The price was average take out, not too expensive but not cheap either. Would definitely try it again maybe some tenders or wings next time. Again the girls that took our order were very nice and try to help out with the menu."}
{"text":"It was alright, the chicken was decent but the sauces weren't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"My son loves Raising Cains but I think its a little greasy so we gave this a try. It was ok. Would maybe try again, but wouldn' go out of my way for it.  We both had chicken tenders and they didnt have much taste. Would have liked them more if crispier/more seasoned. Frys were fine, nothing special. I like that they offer the different sauces but they might do better to offer some kind of tasting - your meal only comes with one and they charge for others."}
{"text":"I love this place I try to come her as much as possible the food is delicious and the cashiers are always nice and very friendly definitely our favorite place since we've moved to Gilbert"}
{"text":"Very good. Chicken is never frozen. But my favorite was the sauces! The spicy BBQ sauce was killer!! Highly recommend. The staff was very friendly. Clean place too, which is huge to me."}
{"text":"The dining area is like eating in the waiting room of a tire store. The food however I loved. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken strips were as good as I have ever had. They also have tv."}
{"text":"Clean and bright...a warm, welcoming feeling. Been there twice and the service was hit or miss. Not rude but not memorable. The food was the let down though. The wings tasted par baked from the day before then fried and lathered in sauce...a really \"off\" flavor. Tenders better than the frozen stuff but still, lacking. Loved the sauces and gravy. All in all, less than what were my expectations and not sure if a 3rd visit is warranted."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with co-workers. It was okay. Not somewhere I would go out of my way to eat at, but it was okay. They are essentially a Raising Cane's knock-off. I still prefer Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Before I dive into this review, I want to say that I tried to like this place, I really did. The name is fun, the building is cute and the menu is uniquely varied. However, there are a lot of disappointing things about this place, way too many to overlook.  I'm not sure whose idea it was to market this place as comfort or soul food, honestly its quite embarrassing for Slims. No self-respecting Southern cook would make food this tasteless. From the dinky, unseasoned chicken strips/sandwich to the flimsy \"Texas toast,\" you're way better off going to the area's other popular chicken strip joints. They do have a lot of sauces, but even those won't save you from the taste of sheer disappointment or the guilt that comes from overspending on a subpar meal.  Also, the customer service here is quite laughable. Even if you are the only one in the drive-thru, you will spend AT LEAST fifteen minutes waiting at the window while the herd of teen workers (I've literally only seen one adult working here) gather in the back to laugh, flirt and plot ways to drive away customers. By time you get your food, you're lucky if it's all there...or maybe unlucky, all things considered."}
{"text":"Ok. We've been to Cains and Zaxby's and we regard Cains as the standard. Slim Chickens is pretty good. We got a salad, some tenders (which come with Texas toast and fries) and some fried okra and fried pickles. The salad was standard fare, the fries were tasty but a little cool. The Texas toast was teeny and cold. Not what I would consider Texas toast. The fried pickles were good but greasy toward the bottom of their cardboard serving boat. You really only need about half of what they serve you. The fried okra were really good. And the chicken tenders...FANTASTIC!! With okra's help they really brought it home for the whole team. The tenders are barely battered and they must brine them because they are super juicy and delicious. They have nice dipping sauces but is almost a shame to dredge the tenders through them.  The customer service absolutely BLEW AWAY both Cains and Zaxbys. 3 different people came by to check on us for a total of 5 times during and after the meal. Most nice sit-downs don't even do that for you. Like the two other chicken tender places this wasn't cheap but it was good. I'd say it's lightly battered tenders are the juiciest and the best."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here with my Wingman and I had the 3 chick's plate. It was excellent. It wasn't to bad but we were waited on quickly. Good staff, good service, good stuff. We will definitely be back again soon you should check it out."}
{"text":"The food is good but Its pricey! Hardees chicken tender are just as good and cheaper! However I will give them the sides though, I loved every side I have gotten there. The biggest reason I only rated one stars was the drive through, If they are going to befast food they need to really improve on wait time in the drive though. I only got one entree! Was the first one in the drive through and it took 20mins!! If I have not already paid I would of drove off. But what really made it worst was not once did any employee check on me, updated me or let me know why I was waiting so long for three chicken strips fries and a drink? I wont be ever using drive through again and till the price drop probably wont dine in either."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to try it. I've made three attempts to eat here. All three take out trys. They don't seem to have a competent staff as of right now. I was hung up on, I tried to order on the way home and was put on hold for so long that I actually made it to the actual store and it was too crowded to wait (which is why I wanted takeout). This last time the girls were to busy arguing about a pen, or something to that effect, that I got put on hold AGAIN for more than 4 min. I guess I won't be fortunate enough to try it once again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was a-maz-ing!  The tenders were juicy and seasoned just right.  Not overwhelmingly salty like some other chicken strip places.  The sauce was delicious and a nice surprise!  I ordered BBQ and thought it would be your standard bottled sauce, but this sauce tasted homemade!  I also found the fries to be perfectly seasoned and more tasty than your average French fry.  I will be back to this establishment whenever I'm in the mood for good comfort food!"}
{"text":"The staff at this place is absolutely the worst.  Management: FIRE everyone and start over.  This place has absolutely no customer service which so ever.  News Flash - this place suppose to be cook to order, that should mean that the food is always hot; it's not.  But what is worst is that when you bring it to the staff's attention they get an attitude.  Last night I asked that my waffle be crispy because they're usually extremely soft and soggy.  When they brought it out, it was again soft and soggy and when I told the server, she only said I told them to make it Crispy.  What??  If things don't change this place will be short lived and something else will be moving in here.  Please train your staff and cook this food to order.  I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Had the cayenne ranch sandwich plate with fried mushrooms. Sandwich was tasty & probably the best mushrooms I've had because the batter it flavored. The peach tea was also a plus. Loved that the sweet tea was perfectly sweet. Their customer service was awesome too. Had about 2 people come and check on us. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I live very close and stopped for lunch.  It's really not my favorite.  I had the 3 and 3 when I was handed the box the chili wings had slid all over the tenders and fries.  So I had one big glop of sweet chili food.  The tenders are coated similar to that found on catfish.  Light but, not crispy at all.  The bread was black burnt and cold.  I will by-pass next time and head to Canes"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Slim Chicken's.  We just happened to be driving by and thought we'd give it a try!  Boy, are we glad we did!!!  The staff was friendly, the chicken was piping hot,  juicy and extremely flavorful.  We shared a couple of entrees which included chicken strips, several amazing flavors of hot wings and a huge variety of unique and delicious dipping sauces.  Speaking of variety, I LOVED that they had so many options of fresh brewed tea .  We will definitely be back!  Hands down better than Cane's!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the tenders, which are very aptly named. They were flavorful, juicy and \"tender\". We tried several sauces, each had a distinctive flavor and paired well with the chicken. The fried pickles are salty (as pickles can be) but they were delicious! They give you enough in one order to share with one or two people. The Mac n cheese was also delicious, served piping hot, very creamy with yummy cheesy flavor. Last but not least was the coleslaw. Again, this was both creamy and flavorful.   Service was attentive and friendly. The restaurant was clean.   Will we be back? Heck yes! We ordered more to take home to munch on during movie night!    Side note: One person gave two 1 star reviews, being the only reviews they've ever written. Another person also gave a one star review, recommending going to Canes instead. This person also has only written that one review. These reviews seems suspicious to me and are way off. I have been to Canes once and found the food average to the point of not returning."}
{"text":"I thought that this place for a bit overpriced for what you got.  The chicken was so-so.  They did have a nice selection of sauces but nothing original.   The Texas toast was a slice of bread and not really Texas toast. We also ordered the fried pickles and have had them before.  They were ok, not a lot of flavor or crispiness though.   Oh well at least we tried it."}
{"text":"They have great sauces for your chicken strips or wings! My husband and I shared the 5 and 5 with a side of Mac n cheese. It was good! Not a wow but good we'll be back. I liked the chicken strips better than the wings."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place! Very Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food... we got a 7 piece plate, 3 piece plate (I had 5 tenders), and a side of fried pickles(huge!) for 24 dollars. The plates contained two slices of bread, half a box of homemade fries, 2 choices of dipping sauce, and the chicken tenders. Because everything is made fresh to order, we were asked to pull aside to wait for our pickles to be made. As a result of the inconvenience, They also offered us a free dry desert (desert in a jar); it contained brownie, pudding, and whipped cream."}
{"text":"First time trying and ordered 3 piece chicken straps Ala Carter. A bit pricey at $5.50. Pieces were not of noteworthy size and chicken was rather bland and chewy/stringy. I chose slim sauce as my dipping sauce - also not a whole lot of flavor. I have read other reviews that had slim chicken responses that said to order the strips tossed with sauce. When I ordered chicken strips I would expect them to be good and flavorful on their own- if I wanted \"wings tossed in sauce\" - I would order wings in suace I would not choose over Chick-fil-A."}
{"text":"So if I'm comparing Slim Chickens to Raising Canes- I'd probably only give it a 1-2 star...but I'll write this review as if I've never eaten Canes:) that being said: it's good food! The fries were good and seasoned well. The chicken was good(a little tough on the outside but still good) the bread was surprisingly tasty as well. I like that there are more items on the menu rather than just a simple 1,2,or 3 meal. I'll have to go back and try some other items. The dessert in a jar was absolutely delicious!!! I would recommend that to anyone! The only thing I have bad to say about this location was the girl that helped me through the drive through. She was not friendly at all and as a first time customer I had a couple  questions and she seemed annoyed to answer them. Other than the customer service- the food was good and I'll be back for more items or test!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the other reviewers came in on a bad day or what, but our food was excellent. The chicken was hot, tender, moist and flavorful. The coating has much better flavor than Canes, Bush's or even Chick-fil-a.  If we are going to indulge, this is our go to place for fried chicken. We were so glad when they built this one closer to where we live!  The coleslaw is creamy, the fried pickles are so so good (yet so bad for us), the sauce options are great. If I was going to complain about anything it's that there's several tea options but no green tea options :-(  Service was very friendly and prompt. Someday I'll come here and try their grilled vs fried... hopefully it's as flavorful as their fried strips!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had chicken tenders and jar desert (brownie). Everything was great! Quick service and fresh food. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!! Sat in drive thru for 45 minutes.  When I ask why it took so long they said it was because of a fundraiser.  There were only five cars ahead of me.  I sit at the window waiting for my food and there are 4 girls chatting and no customers at the register.  I never write reviews good or bad but I felt obligated to warn customers that you will regret going to this place."}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats. One side was incorrect (gave French fries instead of Mac and cheese). Food was not split correctly as all of the bread was packaged with one meal. Two drinks and two meals = one straw and one fork at Slim Chickens apparently. Food quality was good.  I don't believe I'd order from this restaurant in the future, especially with a Cane's so close."}
{"text":"Small chicken tenders and not tasty at all. Texas toast is not Texas toast it's reg bread toasted."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cayenne Ranch Chicken Sandwich and the breading of the chicken was 4 stars but I would give 2 stars for the small amount of sauce they put on it...because the sandwich was drier than necessary. The chicken was better than I expected though so I'll probably go back!"}
{"text":"They started off good but looks like cleanliness is not a big priority. Too bad because the few times we visited the service was good. It was so filthy I just threw our food away and went across the street. I don't understand how an employee can't just take the time to wipe the tables are mop the floor after someone dropped a drink."}
{"text":"This was my third time at this restaurant. The first 2 times were good, not outstanding.  This time was pretty bad. The breading was too crunchy and the chicken was overly tough due to being overcooked.  Slim Sauce had almost no flavor. The fries were fine. And the bread that was stated as Texas toast, was a skinny piece of toasted white bread with nothing on it.  Unfortunately for this place, there are too many competitors with reliably good food on every visit.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, food was great and was out pretty fast. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just saw this place opened and stopped in for some wings. They were really good. The salads looked good too. I'll be back for one of those next time!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles is legitimately one of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. Both components were perfectly cooked and delicious; the sweet, salty, savory combo worked so well. It was a filling meal, almost a little too much for me (not that that's a bad thing). To make it even better, on Wednesdays it's \"Waffle Wednesday\" which knocked off $2 from the price.   The interior of the restaurant was nice and spacious. Cashier was friendly. They also have a wide variety of awesome housemade drinks: regular/unsweetened/raspberry/peach iced tea and lemonade."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got food from here and there was a blonde long ass hair in his chicken his fries were cold and stale, bread wasn't even toasted. Only good thing was the tea. Wish we were able to go get our money back and talk to a manager about the hair being in the food but we are on the run and don't have time to turn around. Never going back again I'm grossed out"}
{"text":"Food is always great - we know the original Slim Chickens quality as we lived in Fayetteville, AR when Slim Chickens was developing as a larger chain - and we can vouch this branch is holding up to Slim's high standards. Staff is always attentive and will go to extra mile to make sure you feel like a valued customer. Tonight they made a small mistake on our order and were very apologetic and quickly and generously corrected our order. Service you don't see at many places. This is an excellent Slim Chickens."}
{"text":"I won't rate this a one star because the young kids working there seemed to be trying but obviously lacked any proper training.  Getting an order wrong is not a big deal.  Not rectifying the problem in a timely manner ups the ante a bit (I finally walked out after paying for but not receiving my order).  But I can look past that...hence, why I still managed to give them 2 stars (again, I won't blame them totally for a woeful lack of training).  It's when you take the product into consideration that drops their rating drastically.  The chicken sandwich I received had no toppings such as tomato or lettuce, just an accidental drop of cole slaw from a different order.  The breast itself was half the size and thickness, ie. small and thin,of a breast found at let's say Chik something or other.  Of course I didn't taste because I never received my correct order.  6.99 for this minute thinness of a \"breast\"?  Me thinks nah."}
{"text":"You would think if you send out a million try my restaurant cards to potential customers you would try to impress anyone who would walk in the door!    They tried harder to make us never come back, chicken was horrible, small sandwich, a drop of mac and cheese and the mini dessert was weak at best.  When they got our order wrong, the lady didn't even care to return to the table to get it right!  Gods thing Canes is only a few mikes away!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.  The chicken was tender and piping hot.  It definitely was made to order.  I had the slim sauce and honey mustard.  Both were good.  I was also excited to try the fried pickles and mushrooms.  They tasted like the ones that I have eaten in the south.  I will definitely go back.  They are my choice over raising canes"}
{"text":"Really great experience here! The facility was big, clean, and the staff was super friendly. The fried mushrooms and brownie were my very favorites. Service was fast and everything was super hot/fresh!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy stopping by slims their always clean and the staff is always very friendly even when their slammed.  I've never had any issue with their service or their food it's always on point at least in my own experiences and I've gone in quite a bit. Haha  They have a drive through, indoor and outdoor area that you can utilize.  For me at least the average wait time is around 10ish minutes.  I've pretty much tried everything on their menu and I have nothing negative to say about any of it and I believe they also have 17 different sauces you can pick from which is always a plus when in the mood for a different taste.  Their desserts are good the only thing is I just wish they had more to pick from. Hah  Oh and they also a have catering services which is cool if you want to have a get together.   Overall Slims is one of my top picks for chicken stops and I'll keep coming back. I definitely recommend slims to people in the area that want a quick chicken fix and want to try out a new place."}
{"text":"For fried chicken, wings, wraps, and salads... not bad. I will attempt to redeem some reviews about \"soggy\" chicken. I did not experience that. Food was good, crispy and delicious; though a little salty for my taste. Fried pickles were a treat, and the wings are actually done well. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised. Best taste was the grilled chicken tenders wrap, and the cayenne ranch chicken sandwich was good. Too full to try the desserts in mason jars, which looks like a brilliant idea (and you get to keep your jar.) Pretty cool idea. Will likely come back sometime in a month or two. *bonus played James Brown and Stevie Ray Vaughn in the music as well as some blues and old time sounds... Southern twist for the desert Southwest. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came to slim chickens with very high expectations and I was was highly disappointed. I ordered a slim combo (five chicken tenders with fries,toast, and two sauces) with expectations of a Cane's like experience. After I finished ordering I sat done and I pondered why it was so dead and as I took my first bite I understood why. The chicken alone was tasteless, but as I dipped it in their signature ranch it made the chicken mediocre. I took a break and engrossed myself with the toast and may I tell you it was dull in taste and lightly burnt . And lastly the fries were up to standards of any other ordinary fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken but whats with the 30 min wait every time management needs to do something hire more people place is busy as hell only few guys working i see a lot of unhappy customers walk away every time."}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I tried this new food spot and we were definitely impressed! The food is excellent, the fresh brewed peach and raspberry teas are amazing, the staff is vey friendly, and the desserts are to die for. We got the hungry plate and shared it. The chicken is tender, juice, but not overly breaded, the ranch chips are kettle style, the mac n cheese is creamy and super cheesy, and the dipping sauces are great! There's indoor seating and a wrap around patio with water misters to keep things cool. Overall we are extremely satisfied! Keep the chicken coming!"}
{"text":"Not worth it at all! Deciding to try only the chicken tenders to get a true flavor of fresh, juicy chicken was a total let down. The only up side was they were hot in temperature. The tenders tasted like they were freezer burnt, chewy & dry. If you're looking to lose money, time & weight this is the place to go because you won't want to finish eating your overpriced \"food\". Too bad since we really hoped this would be a new favorite place.  I'll be moving on..."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. Came here after seeing the sign on the highway and not disappointed at all. Chicken was moist and flavorful and the sauces are fantastic. Had the slim sauce and spicy barbecue which I would recommend both. The sweet tea is spot on. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tiniest chicken tenders I have ever seen, one quarter of the size of the toast that came with it. Fries were way over seasoned. The tiny chicken tasted good, on par with Carl's Jr. larger tenders. Definitely not worth $8."}
{"text":"I went in expecting good food what I got was average service and discussing food mostly because the desert fried pie was cold and greasy after 20 minute wait. I know we all have choices this will not be one for me"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a coupon for a free meal. I do not eat meat, but my husband does and so I picked up a meal for him. All the employees were very nice, talkative, and seemed to enjoy their job. They had a variety of drinks, teas, and the same kind of pellet ice Sonic has! The food came out fast. I drove home 20 minutes and obviously the food gets cold at this point. My husband said it is ok tasting. I think he will have to try it again for us to write a fair review!"}
{"text":"Well, I thought this place would be awesome. I love half the year in Atlanta GA and we have a chicken place called Zaxbys(it's awesome) well I thought Slim Chickens would be almost the same. I was totally wrong. I ordered the 3 piece tenders plate. The size of the tenders was awful, they were tiny, and not all that much flavor. It included a slice of toast and 1 side, I opted for the mac&cheese, which wasn't terrible but not amazing. Grabbed one of the jar desserts also, the Oreo one, it was whipped cream(cool whip style) crushed Oreos and diced cheesecake in a glass mason jar. Nothing that special, although I'm not a big fan of cool whip so that may have been what turned me off of it. It's debatable if I'll stop by again for a bite."}
{"text":"Upon walking inside a worker greeted us and said this was \"the best chicken ever\", oh boy was he wrong. This chicken does not taste right, there is something wrong with it. Not a fresh taste at all. The fries were soggy and overly salted. The sweet chili sauce on the wings was good itself but the actual chicken just ruined it. Get chicken wings from anywhere else, and keep going to Canes for a chicken finger plate."}
{"text":"I've given it 3 chances and now and each time I just get more disappointed, it's sad, I had such high hopes for the place. I've gotten the chicks plate and the slims plate. I will start by saying one thing they have going for them is that they have a nice selection of sauces and the staff have always been very kind. Although with that being said, the last time I went the lady took my order in the drive thru then I got to the window and she tried to hand me 2 different drinks before giving me the correct one as well as someone else food before giving me my correct order. Not to blame her, maybe the kitchen was hectic, I don't know. The quality of food is mediocre, the chicken fingers are good but nothing over the top. I ordered my fries extra crispy the last time I went because each time before they were kind of soggy, even after ordering them extra crispy they were still soggy. Might try the place again in the future but for now, deeply disappointed."}
{"text":"Aw man! I had the Chicken and Waffles, and it was really good. The chicken was fresh and fried to golden perfection, not too hard. And the waffle was slightly crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside, the way waffles are meant to be cooked.  The meal came with a generous side of tasty maple syrup, and a heaping of whipped butter. They dont charge you if you ask for a second helping of syrup, this was a nice change from most casual dining spots.   The meal was absolutely delicious, and this is coming from a true Southerner who grew up eating chicken and waffles. I had a peach tea to wash it down with, and this was surprisingly good as well - not too sweet.  The dining atmosphere was brand new, colorful and ultra-clean, and it's best to try their chicken and waffles on a Wednesday, because its \"Waffle Wednesday's,\" so the meal is discounted a couple of bucks.  The food was delicious and affordable, the service was great and the restaurant was clean; I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We've been a huge Slim's fan since they opened one up in Texas about two years ago when we used to live there. This place never disappoints. They even have great salads and grilled chicken. Plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea, it's the best!"}

{"text":"Had the most juice and good tasting chicken ever.  I got chicken sandwich it was the best one eve. Anything on the menu is good would come again. Waiters were very good and always wanting to know our needs very good service and clean place"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say if you're in a hurry this probably isn't the place to go only two cars ahead of me in the drive-through been in the drive-through for over 15 minutes now... was hoping after the long wait it would be really good but I think I'll stick to Chick-fil-A I never had chicken quite this Chewy"}
{"text":"Had the 5 and 5 meal. Nothing special. Fries luke warm. Employees luke warm.  My family ate other things and the general feedback from them was meh, nothing special.  Too many other choices around and unfortunately SC probably won't make our regular stop list."}
{"text":"Overall chicken tenders are juicy and fresh. They need more seasoning tho. Tenders tasted bland without sauce compared with other chicken tender joints. Place is clean and neat, and food is reasonably fast."}
{"text":"This place is just ok.   We ordered chicken and wings with ranch chips. The ranch chips were tasty, basically homemade potato chips. There wasn't anything particularly flavorful about them, I'm just a sucker for potato chips.   The chicken tenders were ok. Just basic deep fried chicken. We ordered the Slim Sauce, BBQ spicy and cayenne Ranch. The slim sauce tasted like mayonnaise with ketchup. The BBQ  Spicy was good. It had a kick to it with a little bit of sweet. The cayenne ranch was almost laughable. It was ranch. Just plain,normal, ordinary, slightly pink, ranch.   Now I did like that this place had the option for spicy. So many people rant and rave about raising canes, which is good but they don't have any spicy option what's so ever. But overall, this place just wasn't anything special.   My husband eloquently put it \"I wish I would have driven the extra mile to Cane's\""}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this last night along with another couple.  I got the chicken strips with a side of mac and cheese.  No flavor small little chicken strips.  Toast was sad and the mac and cheese was very very plain.  My wife got a salad with limp lettuce.  Salad was small and they charged over $8.00.  The other couple got a chicken sandwich and the chicken and waffles.  He said the chicken and waffles were good and the chicken sandwich not some much.  We will not go back.  Raising Canes is way better."}
{"text":"Food was meh.  Whoever said it was better than lo lo's clearly must work at slim chickens. Waffle was cold, tenders were ok, and the wings were puny. Won't be back.."}
{"text":"The food is great. I love the sauces and sides. Chicken is bomb. Just wish the drive thru was actually fast."}
{"text":"Tried this after hearing it was similar to Raising Cane's. Similar menu with the chicken tenders but here they also have some wings, fried okra, fried mushrooms and one other fried veggie.  Other than Cane's sauce being bit better I was surprised to like Slim Chickens more. Chicken was nice and juicy with good flavor to the breading. Fried mushrooms we got were good too. We didn't get dessert but they have a couple Mason jar desserts that look good to try next visit.  So if you like Cane's but are open to try something new and not wait in lines then try Slim Chickens."}
{"text":"This is a poor man's Raising Cane's. The chicken tenders are pretty good - juicy and not overly breaded. The fries are standard and the Texas toast is small and often cold. I also haven't been impressed with some of the sauces that I have had, like the Slim Sauce and Mango Habanero, so I stick with cayenne ranch.  The interior is pretty spacious and clean, so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Gave them a try a few weeks ago with a free birthday card dinner. I told them they have terrible reviews on yelp and asked them why. The 2 guys working at the window were very nice and said they didn't know. Food was actually ok and I said i would write a positive review. Here we are a few weeks later and I now see why they have negative reviews. Fries were very cold, chicken strips were a little bigger than a chicken nugget. I took my dad and he thought the foods a waste of money including the sweet tea. Very immature young children working the drive thru. Very unprofessional behavior witnessed while we sat at the window at least 5 minutes waiting on our food.  A generic computer generated response is not needed  as you have posted after the other negative reviews. If you'd like to respond, a member of management or marketing team should respond or reach out to the customers your trying to keep."}
{"text":"Love their grilled chicken and different sauce options! When I have a friend that wants another popular chicken restaurant for lunch, I redirect them here and they are always pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner experience was 15 minutes spent in the drive thru, there was ONE car ahead of me, already sitting at the window when I pulled up...    I got a grilled chicken wrap with cheddar and honey mustard sauce.  Passable, but lowest common denominator.  Chicken and waffles was nothing to write home about.  3 smaller chicken strips with a waffle that was fairly tasteless.  The side order of fried okra was ok.  The employee working the window was apologetic about the extended wait, and did try to atone for it with a free dessert.  It looked like she was trying really hard, but that the kitchen was just not producing food in a timely fashion.  I spent roughly $25 for two dinners that took me 15 minutes sitting in the drive thru to get, and that tasted almost as good as some of the fast food available in other restaurants.  I'll not be going back again any time soon."}
{"text":"Was here for the first and last time. I ordered the cayenne chicken sandwich. Got home and saw half of box full of , which is awesome! The sand which had a lot of shredded lettuce and I got super excited. I grabbed that sandwich and took a bite into it... a big bite too! But I was so sad to realize that the \"chicken\" or whatever it was, was sooooo thin super thin that it might as well be called chicken jerky sandwich. The bite was to hard and tough that I was just unable to chew it off. I tried to go around that first bite but all around it was terrible. My dog got a little doggy chicken strip at the window and that looked amazing! If they could just add 3 of those doggy treats in my sandwich It would totally be worth the $9 something wasted on chicken jerky sandwich.   The customer service was great. The young girl at the window was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is great! it is like Chick fil A with a Cajun twist. I like to get the chicken sandwich or the chicken strip meal, both are delicious. Service has always been really when I have gone in as well. All around I have been really impressed with their restaurant and plan on going back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered their chicken sandwich without pickles, and fries without salt.   They bring out my order to my table with pickles in my chicken sandwich and salt on my fries.  Also, they give you very little amount of fries, which is okay, because you won't eat them anyways, because they will be burnt and tasteless same as their chicken.  If you are in the mood for chicken, stop anywhere but here, and thank me later!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night and never coming back. The staff was very rude. The girl who took my order was very rude, and the manager, Tom I believe his name was, was very rude to my husband. I hoped that the food would make up for such horrible service. But oh boy was I wrong. My food came out cold and there was a long black hair on my Mac. Employees were very unprofessional, vaping in the back, and eating food. If you're looking for a good place to eat, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Slim sauce and garlic parmesan sauces are to avoid.  Lemonade is watered down there slim.  Cayenne ranch had flavor.  Blue cheese tasted just like that, shocker.  Chicken strips are aight.  Fries are decent.  Garlic texas toast is more like slim shady toast.  Coleslaw is pretty decent."}
{"text":"In the mood for some chicken and fried pickles so we decided to give this spot a try. Clean interior and we were greeted as soon as we walked in. First initial thought was that it looked like an upscale version of Raising Cane. I order the Cayenne ranch chicken sandwich and the fiancé got the chicken tender plate with side of fried pickles. We didn't have to wait to long for our food to come out. The sandwich was not the best but not the worst I've had. I wish the chicken was more crispy and I didn't care to much for the shredded lettuce ( I would have preferred a big piece of lettuce, but no biggy). Also The chicken tenders also could have been more crispy. They do offer a variety of sauces compared to raising canes which was nice. We got the Slim sauce and mango habanero. Slim sauce went well with the fried pickles and the chicken sandwich/ strips. The mango habanero was more sweet then spicy. The service was good, place was clean, price was reasonable and the food was ok."}
{"text":"The food was great and the customer service was even better! The employees were friendly and helpful. It was our first time in and they were really patient with us. The atmosphere is welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"Mistakingly ordered from the wrong location. They called over to confirm the order and then made it for me very quickly at their location. The girl running the front was very helpful and I received my food super quick. To top it off the food was so good. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Great new chicken place! Like Cane's but 10 times the choices and 10 times better. Tons of sauces to have your strips tossed in or to dip. Fries and Texas toast are delicious as well. Excited for the new location coming to south Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with the chicken strips here. I do like the sauces that they have on the wings. But even then, I would go somewhere else if I wanted Wings only.  Chicken strips were really not that good. The sauces for it, house sauce, was not that impressive. Chicken strips itself was not good, because the chicken was just average and the crust was just not crunchy enough or at all.   I did go through the drive-thru. Service was pretty quick.  Will probably never go to another slim chickens.   Essentially the star is going for the sauce for the wings and somwhat for the wings itself."}
{"text":"Heard from a few people that this place was pretty good, so we decided to give it a try. We went through drive-thru. First glance, prices were pretty steep.  The breading of the chicken was very disappointing and NON-flavorful. It was very thin. The chicken itself was okay, tough, but okay. Nothing special. The wings were alright. They were pretty tough and not as much meat on them. I had them in honey BBQ. 8 of them with side of fries and drink for $11.99. (Meals come with a a slice of toasted bread.) This place reminded me of the Dairy Queen chicken basket, except I'd go back to Dairy Queen.  Needless to say, won't be back.. and DEFINITELY a waste of money."}
{"text":"My son and I really enjoyed our first visit to Slim Chickens. Like most kids, he considers chicken nuggets fine dining while I gag at the thought of yet another fast food meal. This place is a nice compromise!   The different sauces are fun to try and add a little variety to the meal - the cayenne ranch is great and I enjoyed the mango habanero. The cashier was able to special order my son's tenders with a little cayenne pepper sprinkled in the breading to make it spicy like he wanted. I think they should add this option to the menu. When I tasted his tenders I was very surprised at how juicy they were, nothing like the frozen, tasteless tenders you usually find at \"kid-friendly\" places. They appeared to be all white meat, too. Kudos for that!  I had the traditional buffalo wings meal and they were cooked perfectly. There's nothing worse than a limp, flabby wing in my opinion, but you won't see that here. I could've used more heat in the sauce but overall the wings were large and juicy. Not sure why we needed bread, didn't eat it.  The restaurant was clean and employees were clearing and cleaning tables to keep it that way. Ice tea was freshly made and good, too. The manager/owner came around and asked everyone if they were enjoying their meals, which was a nice touch. I'm sure this won't be our last visit here, my son has already asked for more!"}
{"text":"Seeing the poster and stickers for the pecan cheesecake jar dessert...  they don't have any at 11:50am... please don't get me excited for nothing!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I read the reviews for this place and it was a HUGE let down for my husband and I. He really wanted to eat wing stop but I insisted that I wanted to eat chicken tenders.  So since slim chickens serves both, I talked him into trying this place out plus it's down the street from us.  First off, this place was empty @2:30 on a Monday. Some of these reviews said it's busy during this time but it wasn't when we went. I ordered the chicken tenders and my husband ordered the wings. My tenders were barley battered and not crispy at all! My husbands wings were terrible. The toast was dry and not buttered. At Canes you can get a basket of fries, tenders(that are battered to perfection), toast and coleslaw for way less and there's more in the Cainiac. I'm not sure if this place tasted better 3 months ago, but it was NOTHING close to Raising Canes!!!  Raising Canes' quality, portions and price is way better! I'm not understanding other reviews about how Canes has nothing on this place?! If you swing by Canes, their drive thru line speaks for itself. It's NEVER slow there. From when they open, till when they close. So if you think of going here, don't! Keep taking baseline down to the corner of stapley and it's worth the wait for Canes."}
{"text":"I will give Slim Chickens credit for one thing. They seem to be able to consistently produce flavorful chicken. However, that is where it ends. I'm a fan of their \"Slims Salad\" with grilled chicken. I find the portion size appropriate for lunch. The usual trick has been getting the grilled chicken actually on the salad without a trip back to the kitchen. Fortunately, there hasn't been any argument.   I did ate service at this location a bit slow with a wait in line to order or a wait for your order to be served or both. Still, I'll keep it on my lunch hour rotation.   One last point. On this visit, the had a display of good looking chocolate chip cookies at the register that weren't on the menu. I asked the cashier about them only to find out they wanted $2.62 each, including tax. That is insane. No, thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Was our first time trying it. The chicken was great, I liked it better than canes. Had more good sides to choose from if you don't want the fries. And the chicken and waffles were heavenly. We compared it to a fast food Lolos. There were five ice teas to choose from that were freshly made!!! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to say if you're visiting here the dessert(strawberry cheesecake to be exact) is a MUST. I ordered the chicken tender meal delicious and as fresh as it can get. Customer service is on point every time I come here. Highly suggest!  Secondly,  ADRIENNE! Big shout out to her. I happened to forget my debit card at home and only had cash, it was not enough for what I ordered  so when I got to the window I tried taking items off my order.  She asked how much money I had went to the back real quick came back, took the money I did have (even though it was not enough), and proceeded to give me my  entire order. How thoughtful! I work in customer service so being personable is a very big thing for me and boy did she exceed my expectations. SHOUT OUT TO YOU GIRL!   **As always, I'll be back! (:"}
{"text":"My daughter and I met at the Goodwill and decided to get something to eat. When I typed in the location on Yelp this was one of several that popped up and it sounded good so I suggested we come here. It wasn't quite what I was expecting. It's a fast food place not a restaurant. The prices seemed a little higher than what I would have thought for a fast food place but since the meals did include a side and a drink then I guess the price was fair. The french fries were okay, the chicken tenders were really good. The pieces didn't look very large but I got plenty full on a 3-piece dinner so I wouldn't have needed a larger one. The drinks are refillable so I was able to have one there and grab one to go. The ranch sauce was pretty bland. My daughter wasn't crazy about the her barbecue sauce because it was spicier than she liked but I thought it was delicious. The garlic parmesan didn't impress me. The Texas toast isn't huge Texas toast with a garlic flavor like you would get in Sizzler. It's just too halves of one piece of skinny white bread but it is toasted to perfection, not too light not too dark. The potato salad was delicious although it needed some pepper and I was too lazy to get up and go get some. The girls behind the counter were about as nice as they come, way better than average for a fast food place. If the service was always that good I might come back just for that. On a whim I got a peach fried pie and it was absolutely delicious even though it looked kind of small. I would say it was worth the $3 I spent just because it was so good. The crust was perfect and the filling was very good also. I wouldn't mind trying another flavor if I go back. Everything looked clean. The place beats KFC and Church's hands down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It feels like raising canes, but better! Why is it better? You don't get shot asking for ranch. They have great dipping sauces and great sides. Chicken strips and fries are comparable to raising canes. Customer service is awesome too! My wife and I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update, since I gave a fairly poor review before. I have been back several times and in love with the Slim's salad. The cayenne ranch is delish!  And the employees are always very friendly.  I visited today for my weekly salad, but was a little disappointed on how little ranch was in the cups. Usually they are pretty full. Also, the guy working the window had a hickey on his neck. Ew. Regardless, I'll continue to return and look forward to trying new menu options!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a fried chicken breast with a side of fried okra.  The chicken breast was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside and had very good flavor.  They do not offer a spicy option.  The fried okra was fresh and hot and tasted very good..  They had several hot sauces on the table for your choosing.  The service was fast and the restaurant was clean for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"The chicken strips here are amazing!  They are moist and tender and always consistently good!  They are small, but filling.  The fries are great too.  I had the chicken and waffles for the first time this week and I'll be back for those too.  The desserts in the mason jars are a bit pricey for a fast food restaurant dessert, but don't let that keep you from ordering one!  They are delicious and very share-worthy!  This is definitely my favorite chicken restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the day it opened.  At first I was very happy with the food, but lately the quality has been bad, especially with the fries.  The fries often are soggy with no flavor.  They taste like vegetable oil.  Twice we have had to drive back to return the food because the fries were soggy and not fully cooked, they tasted gross.  The chicken is also a little rubbery at times if it isnt fully cooked.  And the toast is always burned, I dont know why.  Raising cane's has good bread that is never burned.  I think we wont go here any more, the fries are just too gross for me.  Every time I eat them all I taste if vegetable oil, or whatever oil they use.  Raising Cane's is about the same price but the food is much better."}
{"text":"It's a shame that 1st person left a 1 star review just because it was their soft opening (which are usually invite only & held before a restaurant's 1st day open). I ate here twice last week. Both times the staff was extremely friendly & helpful. They offered to refill my drink and take up my trash. You don't see that kind of service at most other fast food restaurants. It's a little more expensive than other fast food joints but you get a lot of food. I had the 3&3 my first visit so I could try the wings & tenders. The meat with both was very juicy. I personally like my wings extra crispy but that doesn't mean I'm going to say these weren't good. I'd take soft cooked, juicy wings over fried hard dry ones any day if I had to choose. The chicken tenders aren't overly breaded and you're given a variety of dipping sauces. I was told by an employee that even the honey mustard is house made which I thought was pretty cool. You don't really ever hear of that. The french fries both times were the perfect amount of crispy & come seasoned. The meals also come with toast & a drink. I really liked their peach tea."}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Slim Chickens. I do not frequent fast food very often, but when I do I want something tasty and this was not it. I went through the drive-thru and the wait was extra long even though I was the only car in the drive-thru. There was a half dozen employees standing around in the kitchen. I hoped this meant the food was being cooked fresh and they were just waiting so I didn't mind. When I opened up my food the chicken tenders appeared as bland as I've seen since quite some time. Basic grocery store chicken strips or even the frozen kind would have been better. The chicken had very thin breading with what tasted like zero seasoning, very disappointing. The fries had nice seasoning on them and the sauces were good. The wings were a bit chewy and plain, nothing special at all. The Texas toast was ok but I only ate 1 piece because out of fear of a diabetic coma. In all seriousness, if I am going to treat myself to something unhealthy I want to make sure it is worth it and this was definitely not it! This was essentially a $12 order of heart burn and stomach pain."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and my wife and I loved it! We each got the \"Slim's Plate\" which is five chicken tenders, fries, Texas toast, a medium drink, and includes two kinds of sauce. My wife chose gravy and \"slim sauce\" and I got cayenne ranch and \"hot.\" Under twenty bucks total! We both thought the chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted great! I absolutely loved both of the sauces I tried (my wife liked hers but doesn't get as enthused about sauces as I do). The fries were very good. Food comes out fast and is hot! We'll definitely return. I highly recommend if you're looking to do something different than burgers for lunch!"}
{"text":"I like the wings here. I typically enjoy eating my lunch here. I also think most of the employees do a really good job. I took off two stars for the immature worker (maybe manager) that is totally annoying with his loud mouth. He seems to be quite impressed with himself. He drums loudly on the counter, flirts loudly with other employees and greets customers in a very loud obnoxious manner. I may stop eating there and stop recommending the place because of him. It's also gross to have him come around to the tables trumpeting at people with his huge belly hanging down over his pants."}
{"text":"I frequent this location often as it is close to my house. Aside from being a tad expensive I recently went through and got a large mac and cheese to complement the meal I was making at home upon getting home and looking at the container it was only half-full extremely irritated I went back and the manager made it right. Tim definitely retained my business and I would have given five stars this time around as I always wait to review to see how things change over the course of a couple months of frequenting a place however the large mac and cheese only being half-full was a definite drawback and I have been through before where they run out completely. If this type of operation changes over time where I can go through before clothes and they still have macaroni and cheese or order a large mac and cheese and the container is full I will change the review to five stars. I would still recommend this place to go check out if you have not been before."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my wife and my favorite places to eat! They have great service always helpful with menu questions and the food is awesome! Really reminds you of how good chicken can be! If there's one negative it's just that they run out of desserts too often. Otherwise I'll continue to visit and spend plenty of money :)"}
{"text":"We went for the 1st time over the weekend and it was just \"okay\".  The service was good but I will say there was some drama between employees but it's a fast food joint, what do ya expect, lol.  Food was decent.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go eat there again but if we are in the area, we will swing by.  My boyfriend liked the chicken tenders, pretty comparable to Chick-Fil-A.  The sauces he had were pretty good.  French fries were nothing special, your typical fast food type."}
{"text":"Food is good, chicken is juicy, but the workers, it must have been busy inside. We went through the drive through. Employer has some issues hearing us through the intercom.  When we picked up the food at the window, I'm sure they gave us the persons behind us, food as well. I would go back here but note that it's all fried food."}
{"text":"Wow! Lightly battered chicken, great food, friendly service. Good stuff. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a chicken alternative with a little southern hospitality."}
{"text":"Super cute new fast food joint! All kinds of fried chicken. With waffles, wraps, sandwiches and wings. All kinds of different dipping sauces and flavors for the wings. Pretty impressive for fast food! Nice dine in restaurant and drive thru! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Why do people say this is better than Canes? Have they actually every had Canes?    This was quite possibly one of the worse places I've ever tried. Everything was bad.    My fries were cold and as hard as rocks.  My chicken stripes had zero crunch, were dried out, were incredibly small,  and had a very strange after taste that I can't place. The Texas toast was burnt and cold Wonder Bread.   And it was kinda pricey. Just as awful experience all around. There is a slim chance I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"A less costly version of LoLo's Chicken and Waffles. Great food, great drink choices (3 kinds of sweet tea), and a few tvs with games on. Great, clean atmosphere. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because chicken tenders aren't THE BEST they could be and the lemonade is a bit sour and of the two times I have been in they have been almost out of it. Still a little bit pricey, but not too bad. Family of 4 is looking at paying about $31. I recommend this place if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"Tried Slim Chicken for the first time today and was very impressed. It's rare to find a fast food restaurant with such friendly staff along with the cleanliness of the inside. The menu is has a variety of options and the portion sizes are great for the price. Food was delicious, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service was great. I had the inferno wings plate. Great flavor will come back for more."}
{"text":"Went for food on Saturday Night for dinner and it made me violently ill. Still having sickness 2 days later.   Chicken must not have been cooked well enough. Will not return - ever."}
{"text":"Average  food, varied menu, prices  higher than appropriate. When I compare to Raising Canes I prefer Canes which has better dipping sauces and better tenders. Slim Chickens tenders were average and seemed more like they were processed in their cut and consistency.  The atmosphere was welcoming as were the employees and the decor was nice and not as overwhelming as Canes."}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Dry chicken, Cajun taste overpowers every other flavor. Chicken was dry and hard eat from the sandwich. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is seriously so much better than Canes! Canes is too dry and crispy, but this place is surely superior! And they have more than one dipping sauce to choose from!"}
{"text":"Wow!   Visited based on a recommendation from a coworker.  Home run!!!  The family all had chicken tenders with different sauces. Very delicious   The fried pickles were awesome in taste and quantity.  Too much for the two adults  Fried pies, apple and peaches, were excellent.    Super friendly staff  Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Went there with my Litle one - got a sandwich for myself and a kids meal for her. I had my sandwich tossed in buffalo sauce - glad I did or else it wud have tasted much worse.   For the kids meal- it came with fries, 'Texas' toast and 3 pc chicken strips. Texas Toast was a big joke - it was more like bread toasted(read browned) at high heat. Chicken was super dry - for a place that has words \"chicken\" in their business name - I expected much better.   We eat at chick-fla almost every week - their chicken is much juicier and well marinated before frying.  Do a face off if you don't believe.   Lastly, chick-fla didn't pay me to write this review  (I wish they did) ;)"}
{"text":"This review is about a month old, however I realized it never posted.  Today was my first experience and unfortunately my last. I went through the drive through, the guy on the headset asked me to hold on. He forgot to turn his mic off, because I could hear him having a casual conversation with someone else. Finally he took my order. Once I got to the window, they apologized and asked for my order once again because the person who took I originally spoke with, \"left.\" He was outside talking with friends.   They asked me to pull forward to park and wait for my food. 15 minutes passed, 15 minutes of me sitting with my car running, and the two cars behind had already gotten their food and left.    I went inside and asked for my refund. They could not figure out how to refund back to my card, so I received my money back in cash. I also realized that i never got my receipt. The manager apologized to me, saying \"we feel really bad, it's not usually like this, we hope you will try us out again.\" No other compensation, no coupons or vouchers. However, they did tell me that my food was now ready. I didn't want it. I'm beyond disappointed in how messy my experience was from start to finish. I believe management could have handled this situation much better. I really wanted to like this place, but it's completely left a bad taste in my mouth without even getting to try my food."}
{"text":"Decided to try this \"new chicken place\" that popped up in the neighborhood. I had never heard of \"slim chickens\" but I love chicken so gave it a chance!  Ordered the 3/3 meal which is 3 strips and 3 wings.  I got sweet chili on my wings and tried the Slim Chickens sauce for strips.       The drive thru line went quicker than I expected, and the box came with fries and  drink which was nice for the price. I paid $9.00 which I didn't think was bad for the combo. The sweet chili is amazing the slim sauce..ok.  It filled me up quickly and I saved two strips for later.      The staff was very pleasant and accomodating when asking for special things (such as no ice in coke and extra sauce please!). The food nice and hot, the fries crispy and the grilled toast is an A+ addition to a combo!      Since I am a \"fast food junkie\" and chicken strips are my \"poison\" I would definately repeat my visit!  Next time I will try the grilled strips (looked good in the other review!) with a BBQ sauce.....hm...mouth is watering...time to GO and get an order!  4 stars...worth the try!"}
{"text":"I love the sauces that you can choose from. I personally like the mango habanero. Their wing prices are very reasonable, and they are a good size meaty wing. I also really love that I can get wings in a drive thru.  I would be 4-5 stars if the food was more consistant. This last time it wasn't too busy but the fries weren't hot, boarding on being cold. The wings weren't hot as well. I have had great hot food served to me before, and I know how good the food can be. I still enjoy coming here and hope for some crispy fries next time."}
{"text":"This place is really good on their chicken excellent!! The only cons about it is when I went to the drive-through they didn't put napkins in my bag or catchup, but I did complain hopefully that will resolve the problem"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice so far. This place is overall good. I will go ahead and say it...its an extended version thats similar to Raising Canes (yes I said it). They have a ton of side options along with a variety of different sauces to choose from. It wasn't very busy both times that I visited, but its a new business to my knowledge...so I'm sure that will change. Obviously they have chicken, fries, toast etc. Something that makes them stand out was there jarred deserts which are pretty sweet looking (but taste ok, sorry).   Customer Service: 5/5 Restaurant Cleanliness 5/5 Food Quality 4/5 Food Price 4/5  I'll be back to this location very soon."}
{"text":"First time at slim chickens and i brought my birthday platter coupon with me. Thanks SC !! Very nice decor inside and crazy crazy.....the place had a 10ft line at 2:30 in the afternoon! Looks like Raising canes has some competition! My chicken fingers were delicious and hot along with a tastey spicey bbq sauce. Fries were standard and for the life of me.......the toast ( from any place) Is completely not needed.  Maybe with jelly???? I just dont get it."}
{"text":"Meh, was my first reaction when I tried Slim Chickens. I noticed this place when driving past downtown Gilbert and thought \"hey, look a new chicken joint, I wonder if it's good?\" I love fried chicken/ chicken tenders so I was curious to see how this would stack up. Going to the drive through I noticed that it's very similar to Raising Canes, the big difference is that they also sell wings, sandwiches, and salads. I ordered the \"slims plate\" which is 5 tenders, 2 sauces, Texas toast and fries. The tenders were underwhelming in both size and flavor; for a chicken restaurant I expect this to be the one thing they get right. Just seemed to lack seasoning and I like my tenders crunchy, this had only a light batter on it. I also ordered the 8 wing plate and again, nothing to write home about, I've had better at wing stop and even safeway hot deli section wings. My total came up to a little over $20 after tax which felt a little expensive for the amount of food I received and the size of the chicken pieces. Slim chickens indeed, wish I was blown away, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Their service is amazing, the food is delicious and always hot, and I love it here!! I get so excited to come here :) casual environment which makes it even better."}
{"text":"Been here twice, the food was great both times! The chicken strips are, in my opinion, better than Canes as they are well seasoned and juicy. The fries are great and the variety of sides and sauces is wonderful. The fried pickles are TO DIE FOR. They are crispy and delicious, especially with their homemade dipping sauces. Spread the word folks, this is a great place!!!"}
{"text":"The wings were soggy, had garlic parmesan and mango habanero. Sauces weren't that great. Didn't give me any requested blue cheese. Fried tenders were dry. Most likely a 1 and done for me."}
{"text":"Average .. if you want chicken nuggets and fries this is your place ..same price range and flavor as caines . They do have wings but for the price , they aren't any better or worse than a take out order of wings from your favorite pizza place . We wanted to give it a try since it's new, now that we have I don't see that we need to return ."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken tenders -- lightly breaded & served fresh. Highly recommend the Cayenne Ranch to dip them in. Very friendly staff. Will be back."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant about a couple weeks after it opened, and there were still long lines out by the front door. (Not sure what it's like now..) My original thought coming into this restaurant was that it was going to be a great place for southern style chicken entrees, but after having high expectations of the restaurant, it was a little disappointing. Their service is great, but their food is just okay. I had the Chicken and Waffles, and I was upset that the tenders were smaller than I expected them to be. The flavor of the chicken was great, but the size made me wish there was more chicken. I tried the sauces that my friends had for their dishes, and they were, once again, just okay. The only sauce that was worth using was their cayenne ranch. The slim sauce had too much tomato flavor for my liking, and everything else was just an average sauce. Not sure if I would come here again, but it is something worth trying."}
{"text":"Twice here and both times the prices were high!! I wasn't wowed by their food. Tried their side fried pickles - greasy, fried okra not so good either; multiple pieces died stuck together and wasn't cooked all the way through. Places around town has way better of both and there are few that have worse. Matter of fact another chicken place just around the corner, little pricey to, but it is good, hot and overall my choice compared! But it's your choice; give it a try! Oh did I mention super slow drive thru!"}
{"text":"Well if you like rubbery chicken tenders, burnt toast and not enough dipping sauce for even one tender this is your place.  The only positive thing I can say is the staff was friendly and helpful, other than that the food was most certainly not worth it and a waste of $8"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, having an outside area was a great plus. The two taking orders were very friendly. Our fries tasted great, hot, and freshly made. Chicken was great too."}
{"text":"Wow, the service!  I only popped through the drive-thru, but the service... whoa!  The person over the speaker spoke slowly and clearly (that's pretty darn helpful when it's coming through a drive-thru speaker), and she was incredibly friendly.  I read my order off to her rapid-fire, and she got it right without asking questions.  Give that lady a raise!  The food was pretty darn good.  Huge, delicious chicken fingers.  Fries maybe slightly soggy but still crunchy enough and with good seasoning.  And the soda cup was, get this, not overflowing and sticky!  (I appreciate these things when I'm in my car.)  Cayenne ranch sauce had a real kick but not crazy, and Slim Sauce was excellent; combine the two and it's heaven.  It wasn't mind-blowing and it certainly wasn't quick, but they've earned every bit of those 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've never used the drive thru, dine in only. I'm currently addicted to chicken and waffle so that's why I'm here so much. Don't judge me. With that being said, get the chicken and waffle and your belly will be happy."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! I've been waiting for it to finally open. Let me tell you, this place beats canes. Not only does it have delicious tenders but it has wraps, chicken wings, salads & chicken & waffles! Unlike canes they carry multiple sauces to dip your tenders in, most importantly they have ranch!!! The service is phenomenal & I received my food so fast. Rather than sitting in the drive thru at canes while my lunch hour is passing by, I'll drive a mile further to a place that won't let me down. Definitely will be recommending it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Chicken was rubbery. The food here is way too expensive considering the quality is poor."}
{"text":"I have had so much better canes chicken way better then this place chicken could have cooked. Longer  tea was nice fries were great but chicken was just ok so disappointed I thought it would be great. Because the reviews"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. It is fast food focused on chicken.  I got a chicken tender basket and it was pretty good. Not traditional fried chicken but it was pretty good. All meals except for the salads come with fries and a drink so no extra add on costs for those and the fries can be substituted for any side. They also have these jar desserts that looked amazing! I didn't personally have one but I do hope to try one some time! I'd come back, but I am not sure if this is something I'd crave."}
{"text":"Inconsistent Service and food. They seem to be getting better and maybe it's new location and staff. Do have to admit have stopped coming here and now go to raising canes for better quality food."}
{"text":"It's hard for me not to give this a 1 star cause really, we blessed to be eating out.  Fast food?  Fail!!!  First timer so didn't know what to order.  We go with the 7 tender plate.  The girl at the register must be having a bad day cause not so friendly.   It's lunch time but there is no rush.  Probably 10 customers total when we got there but still took a while to get our food.  Totally underwhelmed.  Chicken had no taste and the so called homemade dips were overpowering.  The bread was limp toast with a hint of garlic?  The fries were the best part, had more flavor than the chicken.  Over priced!!!  They have nothing on Canes."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. They had sent a birthday coupon so I decided to try them out. We got the \"Slim's Plate\" which is a 5 piece tender, includes fries, toast, and 2 sauces. I added a side order of Mac and cheese. The chicken was very fresh and flavorful, not overly breaded. The fries were seasoned well, and the Mac and cheese very cheesy. We got a Slim's sauce and a cayenne ranch, both of which were delicious. Only thing I would change is I wish there was more sauce in the cups, and the toast was somewhat bland. Overall a great first experience, I'll be happy to come back and try them again!"}
{"text":"Very impressed, I'll definitely be back. Can't wait to try more things on the menu.  Great food. The chicken and waffles were great (way better than LoLo's downtown), so were the wings, fries, and pecan pie dessert jar. The raspberry tea was also really delicious.  Very clean establishment, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I hope that's not just because the restaurant is newer, and that I enjoy the same experience each time I come back after it's been around awhile. Very happy that there is a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Was excited about the premise of food that was fresh made to order and buttermilk marinated chicken. I got the 10 piece and ordered a large Mac and Cheese and large coleslaw.  Let's start off that the food itself was pretty good. Chicken wasn't overly breaded or greasy, the mac and cheese was delicious and the coleslaw was pretty on point. The problem is portions and value. 12.99 for 10 tiny chicken pieces, which I took a photo of. The sides were less than a pint, which for 4.99 for mac and cheese is just silly. I might go back to see if they change this, but would visit another establishment before it becomes a thought. Slim Chickens is a pretty accurate description though. Also, if you want extra sauce, they charge you for it."}
{"text":"I think it's great! Both times I have gone I have gotten the chicken tenders with fries and I love them! The chicken is very tender, with just enough breading to give it that fried feeling, but not enough breading that it's all you taste. The fries are skinny and have this seasoning on that is great. The Drive-Thru does take a little bit, but I assume that's just because they are cooking the food which I would prefer to wait than have old food. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"So Just ordered Slim Chickens for the first time through uber eats. One word BLAH! I mean seriously!? We spent over $30 bucks for what we could have gotten at canes for half! The food was terrible very rubbery chicken yuck! We are big foodies and this was probably the worst we have has in a long time. Don't waste Your Time!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to see what Slim's had to offer. I did like the atmosphere. Very clean inside and the patio is huge. Way nicer than Cane's to look at for sure. I ordered the 3 chicken finger meal with potato salad. The potato salad was very good. The Texas Toast was very thin, almost like a slice of regular Wonder Bread. I did like the selection of dipping sauces. The chicken fingers were just ok. They were a lot smaller than the chicken fingers at Cane's. They were tender and fresh though. The staff was super friendly. They do have a wraps and salads on the menu, which is nice for times when you want something a little more sophisticated than chicken fingers."}
{"text":"YUM! Great variety of sauces, the tenders were tender and I LOVED the fried mushrooms. Everyone was genuinely friendly and the decor was beautiful! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So sad this location closed. I hate that I have to drive further now, but hopefully the Gilbert and Germann store is just as good. Thank you employees of the old Gilbert location!!! You were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Came to try them out since my favorite location (Gilbert) closed last week. I ordered my roommate and my food through the drive thru and headed home. Almost 15 minutes later, I get home with the food and that's when we realize I had a totally wrong order. I ended up overpaying almost $10 for what was in the actual bag. We were bummed to say the least. Ended up going somewhere else to get more to eat. I wanted to love this location, but it looks like I'll be waiting for a new Slim's to open before I get to have it again. The drive is too far for me to keep coming and risking this again. I'm surprised there's only one location now! I prefer them to Cane's any day."}
{"text":"Good chicken fingers, had them with the gravy. I highly recommend that combo. Good price clean place only thing that might keep me away is the drink selection. I wish they'd gone for the nice coke machines instead."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and helpful. The food was fast, hit , and delicious. The mac and cheese was very tasty and the desert was killer."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place for the first time today. It's so-so. We had the cayenne chicken sandwich. It was good, but not the best. I'm on the fence if I would go back again."}
{"text":"Grabbing lunch, and having read the reviews 1st, very skeptical about trying. Especially the drive-thru, since it seemed to get hit hard...long wait time, wrong food, etc. Ordered the 3&3, a kids meal, jar dessert, fried pickles, and 1 other meal i cant remember the name of (slims pick,  something like that). Anyway, the wait time was what id expect if my food was fresh, which was fine because I wasnt in a hurry. Guy at the window was super nice and halfway through my wait, another kind man let me know it was almost ready. GREAT. Ooops, good thing i checked before i got to much past the window, no dessert. No big deal, backed up, got it, on my way. . .So the food.....The 3&3 (my husbands) he said just average, mine was great, hot fresh, fries were good, loved the peach tea. The pickles were really good, not too salty, seemed fresh, but its hard to keep something like that totally crunchy when you stick it in a box and close it up. And we shared the strawberry jar dessert which was delicious. I'm defiantly going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for takeout because it was one of those kind of days and we thought we'd try something new. We'd seen Slim Chickens before but never tried it. It was a pretty slow day when we arrived , which was good for us because we didn't have a clue what we wanted to take home for the rest of the family. Logan was at the register when we arrived and thankfully was quite patient and helpful. The food was good and well packed for travel. The restaurant itself was clean and spacious and looked like a comfortable environment in which to dine. So no complaints for this relatively new place."}
{"text":"The place is very clean, nice atmosphere for a fast casual place. I asked a few questions about the various sauces, the cashier was friendly and honest (she hadn't had tried any of the sauces I was asking about).   The wings are decent, not the best I've ever had, but fine for a drive-thru joint. The chicken strips are no better or worse than anywhere else. The food is fine. I'm glad I tried it, but won't be going out of my way to go back to Slim Chickens."}
{"text":"Slim chickens was fantastic on its grand opening and really impressed me. Considering it was the first day the speed was impressive and the quality of the food was very high.  Chicken: The chicken was very lightly breaded and didn't have much if any grease whatsoever. I got the tenders but the wings looked great as well!  Sauces: there are about 12 or so different dipping sauces on the menu and they should fit about anyone's tastes. I tried the honey mustard the gravy and the Cayenne Ranch. The gravy was fine, nothing special, however the Cayanne Ranch was fantastic and unique. The honey mustard was also above average.  Dessert: the Mason Jar desserts are a really unique twist that other places don't have. Aside from being rich and satisfying, you get to KEEP THE JAR! (It's a cool Mason jar with their logo on it) I got the chocolate brownie one and would recommend it!  Service: the best thing about Slim Chickens had to be their staff. They were extremely friendly and professional and when we had a small issue the owner personally went above and beyond and took care of it. Possibly the best staff in town and on their first day no less!  Overall: 5/5 would Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders! Lightly battered, not overly fried. Great variety of sauce and other food. I came 2 days in a row. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"AMAZING EXPERIENCE!! Food was on point! I got a combo box with the siracha garlic wings and tenders, my Fiancé got chicken an waffles - both were great, and then of course we paired it with fried pickles . SOOO good!   And a cookies/cream Mason jar desert!   Alyssa thank you for being so AMAZING! You've made life long customers out a us!"}
{"text":"Their service was amazing!!! I had such a great experience today in the drive through and I wish I remembered the woman's name but she was just awesome. I get half dr pepper and half lemonade and she wanted to make sure her proportions were good and all. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Great food, healthier than the average fast food place, and very pleasant staff, specifically Adrian? I think that's her name. They also give out doggy tenders when I go through with my mutts!"}
{"text":"Was riding on the 60 and saw this place advertised on the sign so I decided to stop over and try it. I got the Chicks Plate that consists of 3 tenders, fries, toast, and a drink. The person operating the drive thru was nice. My fries were fresh and hot which is always a delight. My chicken tenders on the other hand weren't very seasoned and they were kind of small. I guess that's where the term slim chicken comes from."}
{"text":"Tenders were lightly breaded and tasty.  Wings are fried, nothing out of the ordinary.  Good selection of sauces.  Fries have some sugar on them, I've seen this before at another popular wing spot.  I had the strawberry cheesecake jar and it was good, a little small for the price but you get to keep the mason jar.  Likely won't be back but worth a try."}
{"text":"A lot of people are comparing this place to Canes, don't. I love this place for wings as I didn't even have to say extra sauce. The chicken sandwich is interesting, but the sides are the best part the Fries are delicious and crispy and the in house made cole slaw was bomb. Honestly a great place for casual wings!"}
{"text":"Step above the rest! Seriously god bless the stafg for being so accomidating. The food was fantastic as well. Thanks esp to Reanna for helping me out so damn early- great start to my day."}
{"text":"Somewhat mixed. The chicken tenders have a lot of black pepper in the crust, remenicent of KFC. My wife strongly prefers Cain's. The fried okra was very good, fried mushrooms didn't stay crunchy as takeout. Wings ok but not special and not inexpensive. Service was very good, very friendly."}
{"text":"Service was great, fast, and friendly. But unfortunately the food was just not good. Everything was cooked properly but the the chicken lacked any sort of seasoning and tasted almost identical to frozen tenders you can get from Walmart. Their toast was really just slices of regular bread not even toasted throughly. And their signature sauce was extremely bland. With all the other options around I just wouldn't recommend this place to eat. Possibly if the price was lower it could stand a chance with the nearby competitors but currently it does not."}
{"text":"Not feeling this place.   Two visits because we are a family who loves their chicken but so disappointed with both visits.  The price point for what you get along with quality is poor.  The chicken was dry and the toast lacks any kind of flavor.   Stick with Raising Caines."}
{"text":"**CLOSED  Stopped by today to get some of their great chicken tenders and found this location has gone out of business."}
{"text":"Bom bom bom. Nothing else to say. Havent tried it? What you waiting for? Food is on point."}
{"text":"My family and I visited the new location on Germann and Gilbert road. I got the buffalo wrap, super yummy! My husband and daughter split the wings/tenders basket. It was really good. Large servings left us with leftovers. We picked up 2 mason jar deserts on the way out. We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"We loved slim chickens buffalo wrap and wings. My daughter loved the fried pickles. We had a really good experience eating here. Try the mason jar desert, it's good to take home after the big meal. There was so much food we ended up taking leftovers."}
{"text":"Second time here. Wendy's fries, un-seasoned tenders, and burnt white bread. Sums both of my experiences perfectly. Its a shame, I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I have tried both locations and if you want to spend $10 and leave hungry, this is the place. If food is made to order then why were my fries cold, both times. Yes I sent them back. A nice amount of fries, but don't care for them. Bread flavorless. Chicken nice flavor and texture but if your quantity does not increase or you prices decrease, I think you will be out of business in a year. Should have stuck w Slim Pickins but Slim is the key word. I won't be back, sorry Slim!"}

{"text":"We couldn't wait for this place to open to give it a shot and to be honest we weren't  impressed.  We got the 8 piece chicken dry with the dipping sauce with fries and toast and the chicken had zero seasoning.  I was expecting at least a little flavor even with naked chicken but nothing.  Hope it gets better tho they are in a great spot right next to the theatre. The service was great tho which is a plus"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! I think it was just as good, if not better than Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles  (definitely better than Raising Caine's) and they had wonderful customer service, fast and friendly! The food was amazing and their different dipping sauces tasted fantastic. Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Slim Chickens is my favorite chicken joint! I love all of their sauces to choose from and the fried mushrooms and okra are yummy too. If you purchase a large drink you get a nice plastic cup that you can use again and again at home. Slim Chickens is way better than Cane's by a long shot. I haven't tried their wings yet but will next time:)"}
{"text":"This will be an honest review! To the lady talking about a \"young millennial\" not wanting to work, it's fast food dude. Customer service isn't always going to be spot on anywhere food related.  The girls I got through the drive thru were nice. First time going here! I chose it over chick fil a because i i wanted to try it. First thing when I read the menu was that it was similar to Cane's minus the wings and the sweets I believe. When I got my food and left I tried the lemonade and it wasn't good.Barely sweet, tasted watered down, but a good size for a medium drink. Tried the chicken at home and I think they gave me more than three pieces (which is cool I'm not complaining, I guess they saw that maybe a piece was under-portioned so they added more to the box, kudos) but it was so bland. Not super crispy either. The fries were good! I wish they filled up their ranch ramekins a little more. The toast weirded me out a little haha. I wasn't expecting it to look like a regular piece of toast I guess. But it was a tad burnt , I did taste garlic, but it didn't look super appetizing or taste that good. Idk. Some people may love this, but once you try Cane's it's hard to try other chicken places without a comparison. Overall not super impressed with Slims. Maybe they have good wings and deserts, but it's hard to say right now after my meal. Probably should of gone to chick fil a :("}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a whim with my son after a long errand filled Morning... the decor is perfect, the music playing in the back ground is great and the staff is friendly and helpful. The fries were seasoned well and the fried mushrooms were among the best I've had. The chicken strips are not breaded or battered, I missed that and the Texas toast is small and dry. I didn't care for the slim sauce but they have tons of opinions so you are sure to find something you like. Would I come back??? Sure for a side of mushrooms!   Also inside was freezing"}
{"text":"So dissatisfied, I came here to get the fried mushrooms and when I got home all we had was a puddle of grease in a To go box ... not even eatable... I really hope they get their act together but the place has a nice vibe - the food however falls very short ... I will not be back"}
{"text":"This place sucked!!! If you have 45 minutes to wait in a drive thru and they still get your order wrong multiple times then this is your place. Manager said lunch was on him and my card still got charged. What a waste of time and money... go to Chik-fil-a !"}
{"text":"Absolute nightmare!  Price is ridiculous. 30 poor tiny wings are priced 30 dollars.  After 15 minutes, finally got 30 hot wings. I opened up and its covered with buffalo sauce. Fuxking Buffalo sauce, one thing I told them not to serve b/c I fuxking hated it. 30 dollars ended up in drain.  Coleslaw is so tiny that you can actually eat it with once with a spoon. Im not joking.  Last, the service is terrible. Everyone that drive through needed to yell at the microphone and they still cant hear you. While talking to the waitress, she gave me the face like I OWE her then thousand bucks.  DO NOT EVEN TRY HERE."}
{"text":"Over priced, tenders suck . I will never go there  again.   I've tried all the major chicken places and Krispy Krunchy is the best when its fresh"}
{"text":"I went a 2nd time and still enjoyed it, however I hated the fried pickles.  The sundae made up for it though.  So good!"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and hot and the sauces were great. Super friendly staff that even brought a chicken strip for our dog. Dog friendly patio and the establishment was very clean. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional!  The chicken tenders and chicken wings are both delicious and seasoned to perfection!  The Chicken N Waffles is to die for! (Only $5.99 on Wednesdays and includes a drink!!!)  I can't say enough about this location! (The one in Gilbert doesn't hold a candle to it!)"}
{"text":"It's ok.  The chicken was juicy which I liked, but the breading is very thin.  The sauces are nothing special, so I don't see any \"signature\" reason to be here.  It will do well in the market because we really don't have a decent sit down and chill chicken joint.   Pricing.  Decent. About 10$ for a five piece meal.  Next time I'll get the three.  It's plenty."}
{"text":"Came in today around two today ordered chicken and waffles.. chicken dry bland.. not good waffle was OK but way too much syrup it ruined the meal... next is why I will never come back... the service is awful... the girl was cursing in the dining room around guest about \"mother f ers don't clean y'all hear me\" to a table... my mind was blown.. so unprofessional.. it carried on for my entire visit disgusting. They also have no condiments other than ketchup and the menu is pretty lame... no okra nothing besides chicken and fries...never coming back. soooo disgusted by the employees."}
{"text":"I had so much hope for this place, but it ultimately is disappointing. The chicken tenders are very small, overcooked and dry. The selection of sauces and sides is their only redeeming quality. Raising Canes is by far the superior chicken strip joint. Don't believe me? Check out the empty restaurant at 4:30 pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Terrible food for the price. My food was cold. My waffle tasted like an eggo and my chicken tenders were probably microwaved. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in chicken, I thought the chicken strips were sub-par. Also a little expensive for a box of chicken and fries. Close to home so I may try again, but my first experience wasn't great. :("}
{"text":"Great stuff.  I got the cayenne sandwich, it was very tender and had a good amount of spice, and the fried pickles for a side which are a DELIGHT.  My son got the 'Hungry plate' with chicken tenders and fries and those were great as well, nice light crispy breading on the tenders with enough spice to make it interesting.  If you like Cane's you'll like this place, I'd prefer to go here because there's a lot more variety in the menu."}
{"text":"The fried mushrooms were soggy af and the toast is subpar to canes. Overpriced and a disappointment to the chicken industry. -5/10 would never recommend to anyone with a taste for chicken and some self respect."}
{"text":"Chicken is DELICIOUS and service is great. Definitely better than Chick-Fil-A!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent, chicken was tender and moist. Coleslaw was fresh and awesome, the recommended dipping sauce ( Cayenne Ranch) is the best. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Coming back to try the waffles and chicken"}
{"text":"If the chicken wings are not precooked, and it takes average 10-15 mins for chicken wings to cook through, how does my food come out cold less than ten mins after I order it? What a joke.    Was excited to try this place out but was disappointed. I know they just opened so I have high hopes they will improve.  First thing you see is the overwhelming number of teenagers they have up front. There isn't enough space for them all to just stand around. We ordered a 5 by 5 and 8 wing plate and an order of the fried pickles.  When you see all over the signs advertising, \"always made fresh cooked to order\" you expect a wait for your food and you expect it to come out piping hot. Which doesn't bother me.  Well it took maybe ten mins to get our food. When we did, my chicken wings were barely room temp if not cold. Wings were precooked and maybe tossed in the fryer for a min before serving. So it made my wings chewy. Fries were cool and the only thing actually hot were the greasy fried pickles. For $30 I would have rather gone elsewhere.  A positive is their Mango habanero sauce is tasty. But food needs to be temperature hot.  I'm hopeful they will improve.  No need to return."}
{"text":"So excited to try this place and have another regular spot to go. Unfortunately this place was completely unimpressive. We got the chicken sandwich, chicken and waffles, 5 & 5 (which is 5 wings and 5 chicken tenders with fries and Texas toast). The most bland and forgettable chicken I've ever tasted! While the chicken was moist, there was absolutely no seasoning. The Texas toast was more like plain, limp, toasted white bread - boooring. What a disappointing experience....for $35. Save you money and go to Cane's if you want chicken tenders."}
{"text":"I was happy with what I ordered. I had a salad with grilled chicken they included cucumbers, croutons, black olives, and fried onions.  The fried onions are excellent. I also enjoyed their sweet tea. The wait at the drive-through was a little long but I did go during peak time.   I would definitely go back and have the salad again and the tea some of the other items look like they would be rather greasy but who knows maybe they're good I might try them sometime."}
{"text":"Chicken tenders were rubbery and definitely had a frozen taste to them.   Fries were underdone and soggy.  Just really gross.  Why would you eat here when there's a Cane's 2 miles away at Ocotillo/Arizona?  Or a Chick Fil-A just across the parking lot.  Not even a competition.  Hell, I'd rather go across the street to McDonald's and get their nuggets."}
{"text":"Hands down my most favorite drive thru places ever! Slim salad is the best salad I've ever had it never fails! Ingredients are always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Very good quality. Went there for lunch. Hand the chicken wrap and fries. Very good and fresh. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Got takeout fries were OK but chicken was horrible and chewy. Staff was nice but still feel like I wasted my $40. My daughter loved the Mac and cheese was the only good side."}
{"text":"We all enjoyed our food, good prices, friendly service and cool inside/patio. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my husband and I split an order of fried pickles and each ordered The Chicks Plate.   First thing I will say: the place was spotless. It's a brand new location, so that is a factor, but I was amazed at how clean it was.   Our cashier was friendly, but it was several minutes before she took our order (we were the only ones in line) because she was talking with another employee.   Both my husband and I got the Slim Sauce, per our cashier's recommendation.   Our food came out within 3 minutes. This worried me as all food is supposed to be made to order.   The pickles were good. Not the best I've ever had, but satisfactory. The Cayenne Ranch Sauce was very complementary.   My first chicken strip was disgusting. It tasted as if it had been microwaved or sitting under a heating lamp for a very long time. I almost didn't continue because it was so bad. My other two strips tasted fresh and, partially, redeemed my distaste for the place. My husband's chicken tasted old, but it doesn't bother him as much as me.   Both of our fries were cold as soon as we got them.   The toast was not even worth my time. While not necessarily bad, it was just meh.   The Slim Sauce was tasty, but nothing to brag about.   I would attempt another visit to see how the wings hold up, but for chicken, sauce, fries and toast, I'll stick to my beloved Raising Canes."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 x 3 which is three chicken tenders, which are extremely dry... And three wings, which were the tiniest, toughest wings I've ever had in my entire life. It was like they were serving me only the bones. The waffle I ordered on the side was OK. The butter was good. And I enjoyed the upgrade to their fried mushrooms are the best, and their ranch dressing was truly great. When I go back? No."}
{"text":"I ordered the Buffalo Bleu chicken salad and the I tried the fried pickles again.  The salad was ok but the fried pickles were very salty again.  I had tried them back in Oct/Nov 2016 and they were salty.  I figured that it was just due to them opening and maybe just needing to adjust the recipe.  Nope they are salty (not sure if it is the batter or the pickles themselves).  At  $4.99 that is disappointing.  On the plus side they do give you more than enough at that price."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food. Love the chicken salad. Chicken strips are hot and sooooo fresh, and the fries were good. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Despite not hearing some great reviews regarding Slim Chickens, I decided to give Slim Chicken's a chance.   The menu is rather simple and not too large which I appreciate. I got the Chicken & Waffles, and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I  heavily favor sweet and savory items over anything so ordering the Chicken & Waffles was a no brainer. This was a rare chance where I was able to get both tastes in one dish.   I thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken & Waffles. There was a good balance of sweetness and salty. Neither items were overpowering each other. However, I must admit that Slim Chickens drenched the waffle in a lot of syrup which I was not a big fan of. I suggest telling the cashier to go easy on the syrup if you do decide to order the Chicken & Waffles.   If you're not a big fan of the Chicken & Waffles, Slim Chicken's do over other items on their menu!  Overall, it was a positive experience and highly recommend the Chicken & Waffles!"}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of slim chickens. I stopped by tonight and am pleasantly surprised! First of all, the employees are all friendly and welcoming. Christian continuously checked on us and was super nice! I love the ambience. There are TVs around the restaurant and patio. The restaurant is spotless, including the restrooms. As for the food, I ordered a buffalo chicken (grilled) wrap. It was delicious! My son had the kids chicken tender meal. I tried the chicken and it was good. Not delicious, but good. My brother had the chicken and waffles and he loved it! He said it was way better than LoLos. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Great fries, chicken, and cole slaw. I got the chicken and waffles which were really good and my boyfriend got the 5x5 siracha garlic and slim sauces are amazing!! Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because they sent me a free meal postcard for my bday and was pleasantly surprised. It's within walking distance of the Harkins Chandler Crossroads theatre and they've only been open a couple months.   I got the chicken tenders meal and upgraded to the fried mushrooms as my side. The chicken was pretty good, a little stringy at times, and the mushrooms were good as well. I opted for the gravy, ranch, and the Slim sauce as my dipping sauces and liked the gravy the best. The Slim sauce didn't really do anything for me.   My son got the BBQ wings and fries and he rated it an 8 out of 10. I tried one of his wings and thought it was just OK, nothing to write home about.   Both our meals also came with Texas toast (which my son loved) and a medium drink, which was great that it was included. I think our meals were $8.29 and $8.49 before tax.  They have Coke products as well as lemonade and about 3-4 different iced tea options to quench your thirst.   Very friendly and helpful staff and our food came out pretty quickly.  I would probably rate this a 3.5 if we had the option for half stars but rounded up due to the service. I don't eat fried chicken or wings very often but I would definitely come back here. The chicken salad looked pretty good too. It's a good option before heading to the movies."}
{"text":"Great place! The fact is they focus on a few items which make this fast food place a gem!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review Although central Illinois doesn't have a Chick-fil-a, this would be sort of the closest thing around here. Everything is always made fresh and cooked to order which means a slight delay in getting your food. There is a wide selection of tenders, wings, sandwich, salads, and wraps. I have been here about 3 times and I would say that the food is just okay. For my first meal, I got the cayenne ranch chicken sandwich plate which comes with fries and a medium drink. You can swap your side for any other side. The sandwich reminds me of the spicy chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-a. It is quite delicious, however I don't remember if it has any cheese... My next meal was the 5 and 5 plate with fiver wings and fiver tenders. There are multiple dipping sauces and the slim sauce and the honey mustard were delicious, however the tenders themselves were over fried and crunchy and the wings were also small and dry as well. I don't know if they are just overfrying the food, but my second experience was exactly the same. I ended my meal with there famous jar dessert where you get to keep a mason jar as a keepsake. Overall I would recommend the sandwich and the dessert, but the wings and tenders fall from the mark.  Pros: best fried chicken sandwich in town, food made to order  Cons: cook fresh usually means more wait time, dry tenders and wings  Hidden deals: You can get any item on the menu without the drink which will cut down on the cost, this is not on the menu board with the price  Health code rating: A. Clean and well kept. http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2499"}
{"text":"Y'all need to order from these guys they're great for catering they're great for just you and the Mrs. or the Mr. they take care of you and they are delicious"}
{"text":"Walked in and stood at the counter for 3 minutes.  Unacknowledged.  Guess someone else wants my money more."}
{"text":"Another chicken parts chain. Young female order taker at drive thru, a little snotty.  Chicken was average tasting, kind of dry, fries were good. Toast was just plain..... toast! Price average for portion size. Was hoping for something special, and didn't get it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty empty. We got two slim plates and an order of fried pickles. There chicken was pretty good; steaming hot, juicy, was lightly breaded. The fries were crispy and tastes pretty good and the fried pickles were also pretty good. Their slim sauce is gross though... I don't even k ow what it is but the coloring is not appetizing and neither is the taste. Their peach tea was pretty good. Overall decent place but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've gone through here a couple times to grab a wrap. It's always pretty quick and overall pretty good. The place itself is very clean and kind of industrial looking. I really can't complain aside from the fact that the fried pickles were far too salty.  It gets three stars from me just because I feel like there's nothing really special or outstanding about the place or the food. It all felt somewhat soul-less."}
{"text":"Driven by like 300 times by now, all when I'm not looking for chicken.  On the one day I decide it's time for lunch and Canes is closed (damn you Labor Day) I Yelp my location, check in as I pull into the parking lot, and closed..... Why the madness????? I see a lot of hype but at this point I just want some friggn chicken. Hope to find some reeeeal soon!! 5 stars by default, until the food does the talking."}
{"text":"So last time I was here we left without ordering because of the shitty staff. This time we decided to give it a try again after my boyfriends company ordered it for a meeting and he said they had some of the best mac n cheese he had had from a fast food restaurant. So I decided what the hell, why not. It's been months and I was pretty sure they would have all new staff by now which from the looks of it they did. Well we both regret the choice. My chicken sandwich was over cooked and rubbery and the delicious mac n cheese that he had in Bloomington Illinois Slim chickens was Not what we got at this establishment. For $2.49 we received a lump of thick rubbery old Mac n cheese. I hate to even call it that because it is insulting to other mac n cheeses. Now if the Mac n cheese was99¢ I wouldn't be so irritated. What a waste of $21 of our hard earned money."}
{"text":"We were there Sunday around lunch time. It was packed. I was impressed how quickly the line moved and the food came.  Someone complained there was only 1 cashier, but if they can't keep up in the kitchen no sense taking twice as many orders. The chicken was great and hot, the fries were yummy.    I went back Monday to the drive through. It took a little longer than I'd usually like, but they cook to order.  I got the wrong order and didn't realize until I got back to work :( But it was still hot and the fried pickles I'd never have tried were delish."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for three chicken sandwiches long enough to get annoyed, download this app and complain. I'm gonna call the manager in the morning I'll update after. Still no food....."}
