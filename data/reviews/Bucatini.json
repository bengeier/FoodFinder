{"text":"Suprisingly good.  We went on a night that had half-price bottles of domestic wine and had a very nice red for a very good price.  

Food is way above a chain restaurant such as the Macaroni Grill which Bucatini replaced.  My bucatini bolognese had perfectly cooked noodles which are like thick, hollow spaghetti.  It was cooked slightly more than al-dente, and due to the hollow center it was soft yet chewy.  Excellent mouthfeel.  The bolognese meat sauce had meltingly-tender chopped beef, mild tomato sauce, nicely cooked diced carrots, wine and a generally excellent, well-integrated flavor.  This was an outstanding dish both sauce and noodle, highly recommended.  Bucatini with other sauces would be interesting to try, but the bucatini bolognese is a real winner.

The house-made stuffed pastas were excellent, as was the tiramasu desert.  The melenzane dish was very tough, probably due to using unripened eggplant..  The breading was very nice, with good bread and very good spicing."}
{"text":"Great food but a very unprofessional environment.  The wait staff spent more time socializing with the patrons then they did waiting on the customers.  

The good... 

When we arrived we we greeted  by a very friendly and welcoming  manager who sat us at our table.  The restaurant is newly renovated and looks great.  Classy modern and unpretentious.  The food was simply amazing. We loved every bite.  I highly recommend  the muscles. 

The problem

We were never offered or served water.  We had for flag our waiter down to ask him to take our drink orders and he never offered us a refill.  He and the rest if the staff spent a lot of time socializing with the other patrons who happened to be celebrating something and were a large group. Our finished plates sat in front of us for over 15 minutes before the waiter finally removed them from in front of us. The kitchen  staff spent a lot of time in the dinning area.  They congragated near the bathrooms at one point and proceeded to practice their basketball jump shot form.  Really unprofessional! 

What's tough is that the food was very good.  We would love to go back but we expect much better service.  Hopefully the owners will read this review and make changes.  We want to go back!"}
{"text":"Third visit to this establishment and have too say all three have been excellent. 

Greater warmly by the Manager who checked on us throughout the evening. Server (Suzie) was extremely attentive and had good knowledge of the menu and wines. 

Four guests, three different entrees all of which were great. Three apps all good sized portions and well received by our part. Nice bottle of wine reasonably priced. 

Have come to expect great service and food here and have yet to be disappointed. 

Not very many great restaurants in Brampton so hope Bucatini prospers. Will be back regularly. Surprised to see other reviews less enthusiastic but my experience has always been tremendous."}
{"text":"Though we live at a walking distance from Greenway Station, we had never been to Bucatini. So we decided to do just that on a snowy night when I was too tired to cook. 

It has an a nice atmosphere and the waitress was very friendly. Even when we skipped the appetizer, she offered to bring us more bread (unlike some places that limit the bread to one basket if you don't order any appetizer) My husband and I are vegetarians and the waitress was very good at offering suggestions. She also said that we could pick anything on the menu and they would make that vegetarian by substituting the meat with something else. This was a big plus for us!

My husband settled on the Penne Saracena and I settled on Fettuccine Al Limone e Pollo. My husband's pasta was delicious, with a lot of flavor. But mine was very uninspiring. There was a bitter after taste, the kind you get when you squeeze the lemon too hard. When the waitress came to clear out plates, she noticed that I hadn't touched the food and asked what was wrong. And then she offered to remake the pasta or anything on the menu at no cost and even offered to pack that to go. We declined since it was getting late. She then gave us dessert on the house and threw in a couple of free appetizer coupons to be used next time. 

We will certainly be going back. I am giving only 4 stars because of my entree."}
{"text":"Been here just a few times, the first two times went with the lamb shank chef special for the day and it was amazing! Fall of the bone and full of flavour. Most recently I decided to try the classic spaghetti and meatballs and was super disappointed. The sauce was super salty and the meatballs were extremely hard. I was expecting them to be softer and juicy. They were very dry. We also had pizza as a starter and that was very good, crust was thin and all the toppings were full of flavour. Also worth mentioning that the ambience is nice and it's a great place to have dinner with friends or host a celebration. 
Overall still a great Italian restaurant in Brampton just stay away from the spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"Wow.  Where to start.  Worst service ever.  Don't go here if you're short on time.  We visited Bucatini's tonight for mother's day.
There was no host at the host stand - after a few minutes, a man working behind the bar came and sat us.  We were assigned to a waitress who, upon coming to our table, let us know that she had \"two really big tables\".  I don't know where they were, but half the restaurant was empty.  On mother's day, when every other parking lot in the area was full, we should have taken the hint.
She took our drink order, then five minutes later brought our water and told us she'd be right back to take our orders, even though we were ready to order right then.  She walked away and, after ten minutes of watching her go to other tables, another waiter came up and asked if we had been helped and took our order.  When the food came out, the original waitress brought out our food - she had two plates which she slammed down and didn't ask whose food was whose - when we said \"that's hers\" so she could correctly place the food, she said \"ok\" and ran off, not even apologizing.  We presumed she did so to bring the last plate of food.  Well... five minutes later my mom finally got her food after she got up and said something.  No explanation for the delay and no apologies - when we said something about the poor service at that time she said \"I know, I know...\"... still no apology.  She ran off, at which point we saw her talking to her manager and literally point at our table.  He came over and offered us a free dessert - obviously that didn't fix the problem - we had received terrible service - who cares about dessert.
The taste of the food was good, but for $13 cheese ravioli... 5 raviolis certainly doesn't seem right.  The shrimp in the scampi still had the tails on.
They tried to excuse their poor service by saying they were short on staff, but we saw the few other people in the restaurant getting good service from other waitstaff - checking to making sure they were satisfied with the food, refilling their water (our waitress put a pitcher down on our table).  Needless to say, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service was warm and friendly, had the Pappardelle Royal -  Lobster pasta with brandy cream sauce and tomato (it was delicious). No complaints :)"}
{"text":"Nice decor and a many varied menu items.  Service was pretty good.  I am a fan of traditional Italian food and Marinara is their only red sauce, they even use it on the pizza. My dish was good but I don't think we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here.  Flavour of my husband's and my dinner was delicious and we will be back.  Service was also exceptional."}
{"text":"Really great service and good food. The restaurant is bright and comfortable, and the staff are very attentive and accommodating. The menu offers a good variety of pastas, pizzas, antipasto items, dessert items and an extensive wine/cocktail selection."}
{"text":"My BF lived in Madison so we go and visit maybe once a month, and we grab dinner here almost every other visit.  The portions are nice, they give you a bread basket with a nice herd butter to start.  

I have had poor service maybe once or twice, but we usually aren't in a big hurry.  One time the server brought me the total wrong dish and everyone else in our group on 4 the correct item, he didn't even apologize, no manager came over, and no drink or soup or something while I waited was offered.  You would think they would have rushed my pasta out as fast as possible, but NO they didn't."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant with modern decor. We celebrated a friend's 50th birthday here and it was perfect. The friend didn't want a big fuss so there were only 5 of us. The owner, Vince, brought out her dessert on a nice big plate with Happy Birthday written on it & a candle & joked about announcing it, but didn't of course. The food was good. The waitress was very accommodating about the bills. There was a jazz band that played that created a wonderful atmosphere but they weren't loud or the main focus, just added to the enjoyment. Will definitely go back & I hope the jazz continues."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents after a recent Badger game. Building used to be the old Macaroni Grill - which had a great atmosphere - and the Bucatini still does too.

The menu is huge, a bit too huge. Many of the names are italian and not recognized by the average joe - which gave a real feel of authenticity, but made it hard for us to decide on what to try since we had to read the description of everything.

I tried seafood pasta - and it was good - but not great. Scallops were small and the sauce was a bit watery for me. My father tried the pizza and it looked pretty good.

What threw us off a bit was cleanliness. My water had a fly in it - yuk! My dinner plate had two chips in it - and overall it just didn't feel clean. Our waitress was nice and helpful, but when pointing out the fly she just sort of shrugged and said sorry. 

Overall it was OK, but not sure how soon we'll come back."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the food only, because we did lunch take out at work. I ordered the Pappardelle Royale. It was very very average. For the cost of the dish, there was very little lobster, and what was there was very rubbery and over-cooked. The sauce was fairly flavourless. I was just really unimpressed. I also tried the 2 dishes my coworkers ordered - both of them were very forgettable, and all of us were really disappointed. In comparing them to other Brampton Italian restaurants, Canelli's is still the best in town. VASTLY superior to this place, and the prices are much better too.  An added note, the spinach salad that my coworker received was the saddest, limpest thing I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful. The service was a bit slow though, I went on a Thursday night there was only one server and one \"bus person\" , clearing tables.

 We had a party of 4 I ordered linguini di mare and two of my guest ordered pizza and one ordered a mushroom risotto. My pasta was amazing with a great portion  of calamari,shrimp and mussels. I actually think there was more seafood than pasta. Those who ordered pizza said it tasted fresh. The risotto however was nothing special but it wasn't horrible. 

I would go back. But I will be prepared to do a bit of waiting. Not much cute places like this in Brampton. I hope they continue to improve their service."}
{"text":"I'd say this is a 3 1/2. Came as a group of 3 on Wednesday at 715pm. Was promptly told that they close at 9, before even seating us. Once seated were told that service was going to be slow as they had 1 large group booked. 
Service was slow and not that helpful, the 2 servers were young and fairly overwhelmed it seemed. 
The food was fine, my friends enjoyed their pasta dishes, I had the chicken parmigiana, which was fine. The chicken was cooked but not as tender as other chicken parms I've had (my mother in law is Italian and her chicken is always tender), the sauce was fantastic. We were never rushed, even though the restaurant was approaching closing. 
Overheard from the table next to us who wanted to order a creme brûlée, no, the gas was shut off. They didn't seem impressed. 
Overall, an ok place"}
{"text":"First time trying Bucatini last night and was extremely underwhelmed. It was my birthday and my husband thought it would be nice to surprise me with a lobster pasta dish so he ordered for take-out, picked it up and when I opened it, I was surprised at how little lobster there was! It was literally tiny little shreds scattered into the dish. The sauce and pappardelle was tasty but for $27 + tax... I would not order this."}
{"text":"Located in the old Osso Bucco building, Bucatini had manage to completely transform the place into an upscale and trendy Italian restaurant. Despite the beautiful interior and friendly service, food was however, very blend and portion was small. I NEVER add salt to my dish and I had to ask the server for some. He nicely offered to bring back the dish to the kitchen so they could fix it, which they did, but then, all I tasted was only garlic.
I hope they will turn it around, as you can tell that the owners have invested a lot into this place. I left disappointed as I was really hoping to welcome another good Italian restaurant into the neighbourhood to compete with Osso Bucco."}
{"text":"This well designed restaurant gives off the essence of fine dining. The decor is nice and who I believe might be the owner (she kept coming to our table to talk to us but never told us who she was) was very friendly and welcoming.

For appetizers we ordered the calamari and asiago flambe. Both were good, not amazing but good. the quantity of food for an appetizer is very respectable but the price is not worth the quality.

For entrees, my two guests ordered the gargonzola pasta and the lobster pasta. Neither were really great and both very over priced. My wife who ordered the gargonzola had asked for the chef to add some vegetables to the dish which was otherwise plain. He did so but merely added the seasoned vegetables that are served with every entree and don't really pair well with her meal. For example, her pasta included beans which was quite peculiar. Not what we would expect from a restaurant trying to position itself as high end.

I hummed and hawed over the different entree dishes but decided against ordering one because it didn't seem right that they were all served with the same sides (seasoned vegetables and potatoes). For the prices they charge, my expectation is that they would pair the sides to go with the main dish.

I opted for the quatro pizza. It's supposed to be served with the ingredients divided into 4 sections. I asked to have them all mixed together across the entire pizza instead. That ended up being a mistake, but it's my own for making a special request and can't fault the chef for that one. The crust was burnt on the edges though and that I can certainly criticize them about.

The bottled beer selection was adequate but the draughts were not. Only 3 choices on tap. The wine selection was vast and impressive. I ordered a merlot and they served me a very tasty glass.

For desert I has the tiramassu. This was the highlight of the night. It was very light and delicious. Finally, something that was worth paying for!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Margherita was excellent.  Very light, fresh and delicious!  Have been there twice and can't wait to go back again."}
