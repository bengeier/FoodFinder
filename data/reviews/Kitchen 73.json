{"text":"J'adore ce resto pour le brunch! L'ambiance et la bouffe sont excellents! Très bon rapport qualité prix. Les lattés y sont aussi délicieux! J'aime y retourner souvent!"}
{"text":"We go here for Sunday brunch fairly often. It is the  best brunch place we have found so far in the west island of Montreal. We have tried then ask so let me rephrase; not so far, it is the best.   They only brunch place that is better is in Hudson which is a bit of a trek, and they don't take reservations so we don't go there as often as we should. I will review that place soon.   Anyway, back to kitchen 73.   Their potatoes are seriously some of the best breakfast potatoes you will have anywhere. They rival the best of the best New Jersey diners, which if you know NJ diners is a BIG compliment. They are perfectly caramelized, tossed in a parmesan, scallion mix. Great bite, but soft centered. Sweet tangy delisciousness. So difficult not to eat every last one on the giant plates they are served on, but the portions are so huge you just can't unless you want to roll out of there in pain.   Great espresso, or Americano as we tend to get. Regular coffee is good but, you know, regular coffee.   They cook a good breakfast steak, can poach eggs just right, know how to make a decent pancake. Oh, and I almost forgot the awesome hot sauce.   On the slightly negative side, fruit bowls are so so, as are the crepes.   One of the outstanding things about this place is the service. The wait staff are friendly, efficient, never rushed, happy, and deserving of the 25% tip we leave every time.   There are always long lines on a Sunday, but they reservations. Woo hoo! So remember to book and walk to the front of the line like rock stars."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, waitress was super nice. HOWEVER, their Italian sausage looked and tastes like roadkill, and I found a fat black hair underneath my scrambled eggs. The breakfast potatoes were kind of gross as well. Would not go back..."}
{"text":"I went while visiting Montreal. I sat at the bar so there was no wait. The service was friendly and efficient. I had eggs benedict, and it was great. The home fried potatoes are crusted with parmesan cheese and they were dope. I went two days in a row just for the potatoes."}
{"text":"I loved this place ! They have and interesting menu, quality food, they buy local, the place looks great, we had a great service!  I had the typical eggs and ham. It comes with fresh fruits and small potatoes. Small potatoes were seasoned with Parmesan cheese and green onions ( I wish it would have been specified in the menu or by the waitress) as it's 2 things I don't like. Also had a Burberry smoothie it was good and a decent size. My brother had \"la crise cardiaque\" which is a breakfast poutine (crispy bacon, eggs, cheese and fries no gravy!) and everything was delicious!  I'll go back !"}
{"text":"Was really good but lost it goodness. Still friendly but breakfast went downhill. Potatoes really greasy, fruits dry, servers getting order wrong...what happened! Used to be great,"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, new way to season the potato. Parking + comfortable sitting. The only place worth it for breakfast in Laval."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and no wait which is always nice even though we arrived at 11AM on a Saturday.  Unfortunately the coffee was shockingly bad. Very watery with no taste. Decent coffee is pretty crucial at a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Good breakfast meals. Gluten free options. However, service is horrible. My mom and boyfriend came in way before a couple of other tables and we received our coffee after everyone else. I guess you need to be a table of young girls to get your waitor's attention. On a Saturday around 1pm, we waited to be seated for about 15 min."}
{"text":"I had the club sandwich there and it was the best I've ever had. The bun was nicely toasted, the mayo was tasty and the chicken perfectly cooked. They use real bacon and cheddar not those cheap thin slices. I was delightfully surprised about this west island breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 decor 3/5 staff&service3/5 Large portions and good prices for the quantity of food you get. My boyfriend got a simple dish: scrambled eggs with pancakes and sausage. For me it was the Olympian. Both dishes looked and tasted good but the service was rather slow for 10am on a Sunday. The decor is clean and modern."}
{"text":"Tried Kitchen 73 for the first time today as my wife and I have been desperately trying to find a decent brunch place in the West Island for a while now... and let me tell you, we finally found it!  This place beats nearby competition like Allo Mon Coco, Petino's, Ben & Florentine, etc... first of all, the service was professional, courteous, fast and very friendly.  I noticed the owner going from table to table asking patrons whether there's anything he can do to make their stay/meal better.  That's almost unheard of in Montreal as most restaurant owners have become extremely pretentious lately.  After we quickly got our coffee, we ordered our main meals (smoked salmon eggs benedict with St-Viateur bagels and Egg White Omelet with smoked salmon).  The eggs for my benedict were cooked to perfection (not too runny, not too overcooked).  The egg-white omelet was light, fluffy, and delicious.  We especially loved the side of fresh fruits, which all tasted sweet (melons, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple).  Other places usually just give you a slice of orange sitting on top of a lettuce leaf.  Not here!  The ambiance inside is also welcoming with a clean, modern/contemporary look.  I hope this place lasts for a while and doesn't become as snooty as Allo Mon Coco just down the road."}
{"text":"My simple tongue really enjoys the breakfast here. I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant- mind you I had to wait about 7minutes to get a coffee after being seated on a saturday on a particular occasion. I recommend this place as a great restaurant for simplicity."}
{"text":"Une de meilleure place à déjeuner à laval arriver tôt pour ne pas faire de line up . Bonne portion, fruits frais et bon service"}
{"text":"Been for brunch a couple of times and really enjoyed it. Their staff are attentive, the place was clean, the portion size is good for the price, and if you're gluten free they also have a gluten free menu. They also have parking at the back which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 min for a table....I've now waited 40 for a bowl of oatmeal- cheese omelette and a Mickey Mouse pancake. NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Plats décevants. Coupelle de fruits dans les assiettes décevante: quelques petits morceaux de fruits coupés la veille ou plusieurs heures à l'avance, donc secs et non-appétissants. Par contre, service rapide, courtois et efficace. Décor intéressant. Je n'ai cependant pas compris pourquoi les dizaines de personnes faisait la queue pendant si longtemps pour prendre le petit-déjeuner dans cet endroit si peu exceptionnel. Il y a beaucoup mieux dans les environ..."}
{"text":"First time at this location with my girlfriend for brunch.  Our waitress was super friendly and recommended my dish when I was unsure of my order. The menu is vast with lots of variety. We sat at a table beside the window which was pretty cold by the end. I went with the strawberry and cream crêpes with nutella on the side. Big portion which I could not finish. My capuccino was made well. I would return for another meal."}
{"text":"Bad service. You can't force clients to change tables in the middle of a nice meal. And in awkward seating with people bumping into us. Terrible experience. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast.  Waitress could have been more friendly. Whenever I go into a restaurant I always check the bathroom. Usually if the bathroom is clean, the kitchen is also clean. I was very disappointed, my impression was that the bathroom metal walls had not been cleaned since the previous tenant."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch here and it was actually pretty decent.  The waffle was topped with a huge mound of assorted fruits with some cream on the side.  I doused my plate with maple syrup too.  Service was friendly.    I wouldn't order the pasta though because it's something you can make at home."}
{"text":"Very good food. The portions are HUGE and the healthy option was very satisfying. I ordered the Montebello omelette and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Les ingrédients sont de bonne qualités! On y sert de très bons déjeuners et un bon espresso! La terrasse l'été est agréable et on profite bien du soleil!"}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful atmosphere and the food was beyond expectations.  First bite of 'The Cinnabon' was a delightful surprise.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place with a fantastic menu. the food & pricing was right up there. Very delicious all around."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends and we really enjoyed the menu at competitive prices & excellent service. We had a chance to meet one of the owners who was very friendly. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a girl friend on a Saturday morning. Arrived at 9:30am, plenty of seats available.... but was for some reason seated at the farthest end of the restaurant next to the washroom.  Without exageration, the waiter took our order 35 minutes after we were seated.    The coffee was watered down.  The food was ok. I ordered the Le Lavalois omelet: spinach, asparagus and cheese, and my girl friend ordered Le Sutton: eggs, bacon, sausage, crepe.  The plate is served with fruits: a bowl of 2 grapes, 1 pineapple chunk, 2 cantaloupe chunks.    I tried her crepe and it was tasteless and rubbery.  It was rolled, and had 1 strawberry cut in half in it, with little syrup/chocolate drizzled on top.    My omelet was real bland.  I liked the potatoes the least: it was cubed, with chopped shallots, tossed in parmasan cheese.  You may end up being a fan of this, but, I didn't like it.  It was dry.  Overall, I would say, sure, come here if family is visiting, or go with friends to catch up, but there are other options on the West Island that offer better tasting food.  A good part of this visit though, was the polite waiter.  He helped stabilize the table as it was wobbly."}
{"text":"Not accommodating with the menu for food restrictions. They even said that the did not have an item because they did not want to prepare it. After insisting, they suddenly had it. I would not go back."}
{"text":"My new favourite for bfast in the west. Solid. Great service, good ambiance and tasty food options. A bit pricier than most, but good quality. All in all, a great experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Breakfastpoutine = 6 stars if I could. If you like to compartmentalize your plates, then might not be for you. If you like to mix everything up into one tastebud orgasmic dish; one word - the breakfast poutine! (okay, that's three words and a punctuation.. but yeah, you get the picture"}
{"text":"Food is very good!! Somes dishes are classic breakfast with a little italian twist which i loved! Waiter was nice, service fast and prices are very reasonable.   I also enjoyed the open and light atmisphere and decor! Woukd def come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Funny thing happened concerning my review about the terrible experience I had at this \"resto\"... Someone named Eliane G. Sent me a very nasty p.m. (private message) telling me horrible things I won't repeat, and this person only has 1 review, and it is a glorious one about this place.  Coincidence?  I think not. The owners or friends of, or family better watch what they say on the internet. Even in p.m. mode... I will repeat, my experience at this restaurant was TERRIBLE.  And it seems to get worse with time."}
{"text":"Superbe trouvaille et un beau menu sans gluten (avec une belle diversité) pour ma chérie..... une accueil impeccable avec pleins de sourires! Et que dire des assiettes  c'était copieux et DÉLICIEUX! On y retournera c'est certain!"}
{"text":"I don't know if y'all follow my reviews but I like food and I'm picky about food so that makes for some pretty high standards. K73 meets and exceeds those standards.   Let me start out by saying the service is phenomenal. We showed up at 9:58 for 10am reservations and our table was ready and we were seated promptly. Right away we were asked if we wanted coffee and let me tell you, the best iced coffee in Montreal/Laval. Not too sweet and not too bitter. It was perfect.  Can't comment on the regular coffee since I didn't have it but it smelled nice.  Their menu is breakfast with a twist. It isn't your standard bacon and eggs (although they have it too). Their menu has all kinds of deliciousness.  As a person dining with a little human I loved that they served my daughter first. It let my husband and I enjoy our meal in peace! They also provided her with crayons and paper for drawing in. Total win there!   For our meals we choose a waffle eggs Benedict with short braised rib. Holy mother of god! I had the same meal in Vermont and it sucked there, rocked here. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. It was a hearty meal.   I, as a picky eater, had the bacon eggs and sausage. I like the fact that their potatoes aren't mashed up. Maybe it's the American in me but I like home fries, not mashed potatoes. Not only that but these were sautéed in chives and sprinkled with parm cheese! Potatoes and cheese? Yes please!   Will I be back? For sure. I found a new favorite breakfast place in Laval. Close to home, great food, nice decor and a friendly staff! See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Second visit, and still very happy about the food! Service was a bit long to start off (taking orders and service coffee), but once that was done, it went very well.  One thing I was not impressed with was the \"regular\" orange juice. You can order a freshly squeezed one, or the regular, which I thought would be Tropicana style or at worse, Oasis. But it tasted like a diluted Tang. Not gonna ask for that again!"}
{"text":"My favourite spot for breakfast !! The food is perfect the staff is amazing and so friendly ! They make you feel so comfortable !"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service is questionable. Needs improvement. Worst coffee I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite breakfast place  The food is delicious,  It tastes like genuine food, more homemade than other restaurants  The homemade Italian sausage is absolutely phenomenal  The breakfast potatoes with Italian parmigiano is exquisite  Will definitely return over and over"}
{"text":"Great place with lots of options and big portions.  Good choices for kids and not expensive. Even washrooms are clean.  You should give it a try."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch yesterday and the food, as the service, were really great. Only quark was that the soup could have been a little warmer but it was amazingly tasty.  Went with friends.  Pizza looked amazing as did the Steak and I had a Steak Sub it was really good.  I would definitely go back and recommend it."}
{"text":"Spent the July 4th weekend in Laval. Kitchen 73 was not too far from our hotel.  You expect a typical modern diner.  What you get is one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time.  The food was delicious and the portions sizable, especially for the price.  The waiter was very nice to us as Americans visiting town.  They squeezed fresh orange juice and also provided me dairy free creamer. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Price but doesn't compare to other breakfast places in the west island.  I will never come back again, food wasn't done properly and the people handling my food was dodgy."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  Boyfriend and I were slightly worried they wouldn't speak English, but they did and had a menu in English.  The food was AWESOME.  We both completely finished our plates.  The servers didn't bother us while we were eating, served water when we ran out, were quick with the check.  It was absolutely wonderful.  We sat right in the corner of the building with tons of windows and morning light.  Great place -- if you're driving through I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's no secret I love hoarding bookmarks and eventually make my way to places that are long overdue to a visit and Kitchen 73 was one of them. My greatest disappointment was the realization that something... changed... about this place from the mostly positive earlier Yelp reviews to those that have appeared within the last week or so.   Kitchen 73 is located near the heart of Laval just off busy St-Martin street in a building that showcases a large modern interior without the warmth and color I'm used to when visiting other breakfast themed locations.   As it was Monday morning, plenty of seating was available. Awesome!  Firstly, the service was from start to end was professional, quick and accommodating. Coffee refills were taken care of quickly and follow-up needs met.  The major problem we encountered was pretty much the food.... which in itself... is actually BRINGS me to this restoraunt. I went with the strawberry crepe and my wife the choco-banane waffle. We were both dismayed by how bad the meal was considering the value we got for the price we paid.  The crepe was decent enough though the strawberries weren't as good as they can be and the English cream, which lacked actual taste was way too liquidy. My wife's waffle was decent enough as well but the chocolate felt \"off\", as if it were some poor imitation of actual chocolate. We were both seriously wondering when we left if the ingredients we got served were of the best quality as they can be.  Secondly, both our meals came with no sides. Usually, you'd get a side of potatoes, fruits, toasts or whatnot but both our meals didn't. It was a crepe filled with fruits and a waffle with some banana & chocolate. Coffee was included.   Perhaps we were previously spoiled elsewhere in our experiences and it's unfair to compare places to ALLO MON COCO but I can tell you for the $15 a plate we paid that this no where comes close to competition barely a few blocks away. A $15 plate with strawberry crepes elsewhere would come with fruits, potatoes, beans, toasts and whatnot.  So ultimately my experience was an average, overpriced breakfast with great service. Truth be told, I expected more and sadly for Kitchen 73, I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really nice staff. They kept passing by to ask if everything was okay and if we needed anything. Our orders came fairly quickly. I had the \"Olympian\" eggs Benedict which I really enjoyed. The sauce wasn't too salty or too heavy. Absolutely loved the Parmesan tossed potatoes. There's also a small bowl of fruit. Coffee is unlimited with breakfast dishes. I had the mint tea which was perfect.   My only complaint, it was hot!! It was so hard to sit still because it was so warm. We were actually sweating and sticking to our chairs. There's an outdoor seating area too but the wait would have been too long so we chose to sit indoors.   Will definitely return next time!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for breakfast, some original offerings. Had the rapini sausage and mozzarella omelette which was good. Waiter was very pleasant and service was fairly quick. Seemed a little pricey compared to other breakfast places, otherwise would have given four stars."}
{"text":"Having breakfast with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while.  I had the waffles with seasonal fruit drizzled with English cream and it hit the right spot.   It was really tasty and the waffles weren't over cooked."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in the land of many breakfasts.   Didn't start off well when the host warned me 1.5 hours ahead of time that \"it gets busy at 11:30 AM and I'll probably have to take your table from you.\"  Gee thanks. I'll hurry up. I'd have left if I wasn't meeting someone by appointment.   Can I add the resto was half empty.  But that all changed when I met the lovely waiter   Alex..his great mood, recommendations and charm made it a great experience.   The food is good. But quite the same as other places with the exception of many gluten free choices.   Go for the service. Ignore the snooty upfront."}
{"text":"I got brunch with friends and honestly speaking it was delicious! The menu is very overwhelming, we honestly took some time to think of what we were getting. Lots of good choices!"}
{"text":"After driving around Laval hoping to find a nice brunch place I came across kitchen 73, it's right off the 15. Nice logo and there is plenty of space. For a Saturday morning I didn't have to wait and even got a seat outside. I like that they isolated the view of all the cars passing by, I would prob felt I was sitting in the middle of a highway.  The service was a strike out! If you can't remember the order then write it down please. You you don't have skim milk latte then come back and say you don't, don't tell us 20 min later. Coffee is not usually something customers like to wait for in the morning :)    If a group of friends all hear the same thing don't say the customer you didn't mention it.  We ordered a latte with skim milk, after waiting 20 min the meal comes with no coffee. Only to tell us they don't have skim milk. Ok so we order a cappuccino. We asked bread with no butter ... I would have let this one slide , but yes we got butter. Not to that I want to keep going but when we ask for ketchup it's nice to get it during the meal not after we are done. I found the service was lacking.  I did find the food ok ..quantity is high but quality not so much... I found the fruits sour and no taste. The steak and eggs was good, it was a little on the fatty side.  This please does need some fine tuning in my opinion.. It does have a large place and a great concept. I hope me next time there I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"The place is nice but extremely noisy. Service is good & th plates are pretty full. I wasn't very impressed but it was ok."}
{"text":"Brunch du dimanche entre amies, alors que nous devions nous rendre en ville, la tempête nous a découragé et nous avons décidé de rester dans les environs pour déjeuner. Nouveau restaurant qui a pris l'emplacement du Eggspectation. Petit déjeuner traditionnel d'oeuf/bacon/saucisse/patate/crêpes/gauffres dans un décor branché. Rien de vraiment spécial. J'y essayerai peut-être le lunch."}
{"text":"Great efficient service, delicious potatoes and eggs Benedict. The menu has a wide variety, decent prices. Would definitely come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Kitchen is the go-to spot for my gf and I. I haven't had a bad experience - the food is great, coffees good, and service has only gotten better. Definite win in my books."}
{"text":"I have been to kitchen 73 twice and both times were a delight. Good service, good food, nice decor. I especially like their homemade potatoes. Prices are reasonable too. Definitely a good breakfast nook."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been there several times and every different dish I've ordered has been extraordinary. They really put a different spin on breakfast."}
{"text":"Seriously charged $2 to add chocolate chips to my daughters pancakes! Food boring and salted to death. They actually counted the fruit....2 grapes, 2 mellon, 2 pineapple and half a slice of dried up pink grapefruit! Terrible coffee... that is why \"bottomlesss\"+ bad deco r, terrible paint job and black tape to patch up counter stools. Do 2 not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"We brunched this morning for the first time at Kitchen 73. It has a nice, open ambience with lots of windows (facing a parking lot, though). The best thing about this place is the huge portions, and the fact that the kids meals are $3.73. We stuffed ourselves silly and had leftovers to take home. The home fries are the bomb. I think they have Parmesan, or crack, or something on them that made them so addictively crunch and salty on the outside, but tender on the inside. My husband raved about the hollandaise sauce on his 'Crise cardiaque' (poutine with bacon, hollandaise, and an egg on top). My french toast was generously topped with mountains of mixed berries and melons, and the kids' pancakes were huge...and did I mention kids meals were only $3.73?? Bacon was nicely crisp, sausage and coffee were just so-so. But for what you get, it's great value. We enjoyed our dining experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"L'avalanche: 6 oz. sirloin steak, 3 eggs, sausages, ham, bacon, baked beans, toasts, crepes, potatoes, french toast, and a bowl of fruit. This plate is not a breakfast for champions, but for heroes. This plate would make a bear feel full and it's not to be taken lightly. But was it good? Heck yeah it was! I made sure to drizzle the provided syrup over everything. Bacons were crispy, eggs were shining, sausages were fatty, steak was rare, everything was spot on. Ron Swanson would be very proud of this.   The only downside is that the service was incredibly slow. I understand that a busy lunch hour can slow down the service but waiting close to 40 minutes for breakfast was maybe a bit too much for me.   Would I come back? If I had the time and the hunger of a bear, absolutely."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. I was not overly impressed. My kids are the grilled cheese, I had the eggs Benedict and my mother some French toast. The grilled cheese was mostly toasted bread with a sprinkle of grated cheese, my eggs Benedict was ok nothing to write home about and same for the French toast. The breakfast potatoes were very good although I don't think they were made to order as they were not very hot. Overall, the service was good. Waiter was attentive and fast. The food was ok, I will probably give it another try."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special. Tuna cakes and omelette.  Delicious. It came with salad.   I'll be back.   Generous portions and lovely presentation."}
{"text":"Awesome place For breakfast!  Found my new place to go to when looking for a upscale restaurant....clean and bright!  Would recommend this place to anyone of my friends."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here to have breakfast, I had the \"Sel & Sucre\" and my girlfriend had the \"Bagellox\".  Both of the dishes tasted super good, mine was a crepe with egg, bacon, ham and cheddar. It came with potatoes with parmesan on them, it also had fruit on the plate (you could check the picture I added to see what it looked like).   My girlfriend had the Bagellox and as you can guess it was two bagel halves with salmon and cream cheese (which came separate). It also came with salad (no dressing though)   Waitress was really friendly and we got our food quickly, and she asked us if everything was okay and if we needed anything after getting our food. So overall the experience we had was really good, I had never been here before!   PS: Try their freshly made orange juice its really really delicious!"}
{"text":"Variété ! Kitchen 73 sert des déjeuners, des brunchs et des plats de lunchs. Il y a plusieurs choix possible pour autant des personnes végétariennes ou très affamées. Les ingrédients sont frais et les patates gratinées sont succulentes.  Nous sommes allés le samedi vers 11h00, et le service était rapide. L'expérience est intéressante et le goût est original... différent des autres resto déjeuner-brunchs que nous connaissons."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times. All 3 times was for breakfast Saturday morning with my buddy. The food and atmosphere is very good, but the service is terrible. It takes forever to get a coffee. It's breakfast and people want coffee, it should not be a struggle to bring two cups. Last time we were there I flagged down, what seemed to be, the manager and asked if we could get coffee. He was useless. All he had to do was grab a pot and fill the cups that are already on the table. Instead  he took off to go look for our server and disappeared. Thanks for nothing. If you can get passed the inefficient service this place is fine...but I'll be spending money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is pre-made. Potatoes are from yesterday - only warmed up for service. Fruit is cut in the morning and arrived at the table dry. The server admitted that the food was prepped earlier. Crepe was nice, this is why I give 2 stars, not 1. The restaurant is quite expensive, considering the sad quality of the food. Ben and Florentine is much much better to have brunch at. I will not come back."}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate I received from a friend. When I went to pay my bill they told me it's not valid on Sunday. Since it doesn't say so on the certificate or anywhere else in the restaurant you are supposed to just guess this.  For not accepting a 50$ certificate they are going to get negative reviews on every major review site and none of my business forever."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I had a basic meal option of two eggs with potatoes and fruits and then I choose 2 choices which were sausages and a pancake. And my boyfriend had the \"crise cardiaque\" which is a breakfast poutine. The food was pretty good but just a tad more expensive than a usual breakfast place. The service was pretty good although we visited on a Monday so it wasn't busy at all so I'm sure on a busier day it would be different."}
