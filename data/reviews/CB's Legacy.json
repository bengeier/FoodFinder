{"text":"Jose and Lloyd were incredibly accommodating. Their kindness stretches for miles, but more importantly, their professionalism is their key to success. They're very prompt and catered to our needs with ease. We hardly waited yet didn't feel rushed.  The food was excellent to say the least! I ordered the eggs Benedict that was well plated and made with their own twist. Their potatoes were phenomenal. My fiancé ordered the chilled tomato soup and was completely satisfied.  The price is very right for brunch.  We plan on coming back for their evening selection and have already decided this is our favorite spot for date night!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely in love with the spinach quiche, is it still on the menu? I didn't notice it on the new posted menus?"}
{"text":"Just not worth the price. We were very surprise for the price isn't worth it. This place is just over price compare to the food they serve. Wife had their special seabass which was $45 and it was undercook and it smell like uncook fish. We asked them to cook it bit more. Only thing that was decent were the fries."}
{"text":"First time dining there. Went on a Sunday. Friendliest people you will ever meet. The live entertainers and another patron knew my name before I left. Quite the experience!  I would suggest the Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"overpriced and way overhyped. food (calamari, burger, salads) was mediocre at best. service was rushed, impersonal, & simply uncomfortable. two stars for the nicely-decorated interior & patio."}
{"text":"Chef Bernard and now called CB Legacy we are open 7 days a week from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday Saturdays and Sundays we open at 10:30 to 9 p.m. looking forward to seeing everyone"}
{"text":"Believe it or not CB's Legacy, formally Chef Bernards Bistro is STILL AS GREAT as before (see the restaurant's former reviews as Benard's Bistro). Each time I visit LV I eat almost all my dinners here, and Brunch if I'm lucky to be in town on a Sunday.  The food is really 5 Star and the prices are $$ out of $$$$$.  The presentation- Art.  When I took a byte of the Pistachio Lavender Salmon I laughed!!! The taste was so excitingly full of multiple joyous flavors!! Food has never made me laugh and smile and that dish was amazing. Other dishes where the Quiches, the flavors are like a world class Orchestra lead by an amazing Maestro.  Also the music the local musicians play and the evening Sinatra musical Flashbacks combine a most wonderful experience.  Truly  amazing. A couple walked by to check out the menu our front, and I enticed/escorted them in to enjoy a repeat performance.   They did."}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro was my favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and I am happy to report that CB Legacy follows in that tradition. I have already visited Legacy twice, even once before its official opening, and I plan to return many times.  Yes, I know about the Strip. I've heard of their Michelin rated venues. I understand they are supposed to be the epitome of service and class. There are many restaurants on Las Vegas Boulevard that I love, but as a local, I want to enjoy dinner at a place with classic service and excellent food, but more importantly, that place needs to feel like it belongs to me.   CB Legacy captures that atmosphere, as did Bernard's Bistro. The cosmetic changes have only enhanced that style to more closely follow a classic vein. When visiting Legacy, I am reminded of the fine restaurants of my home on the East Coast. They serve generations from the comfort of an unassuming neighborhood location. Restaurants in towering hotels and casinos? Those will come and go with the waves of fickle tourists. As its name indicates, there is a Legacy to honor here.  The food itself is an elegant fusion of French and California cuisine. Refreshing yet savory with a subtle artistic presentation, you will have fast favorites, and if you return, you will have too many favorites to count.  CB Legacy is the kind of place you want to tell all your friends about, while also keeping it an absolute secret. You'll be damned if you recommend it to someone who lacks the appreciation.   Compliments to the new management lead by Chanthy, who had the great insight to keep the menu virtually unchanged. While visiting, I also met Anthony Cortez, who assisted Chanthy in adding the new black and red color pallette. Black napkins, my friends, that's how you know you're talking about professionals."}
{"text":"This was a real treasure to find off the Las Vegas Strip.  The service was exceptional.  The local entertainment was perfect ambiance and just the right music to set the mood for a delicious meal.  The lamb was delicious.  If you happen on a night when they have a Prix Fixe Menu with menu pairing, it would be a plus.  Their wine menu is extensive and we were not disappointed with their recommendation.  Don't miss this evening.  You will go home well fed and have a collection of new friends from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in for \"Happy Hour\", which is Tues-Friday 4-5pm. A very brief window, we walked in at like 4:59 and they honored the specials menu. Which had maybe like 8 items on it all for $9.99. Can't beat that price for quality food. Gave us a chance to give this place another try. Previously I was not impressed, I was still mourning the former restaurant, Noodle Cha Cha.   I ordered the Cod Fish n Chips, it had another fancy name. My husband ordered the Steak n Frites. Service was better than last time, last time they checked on us every two seconds it was annoying. This time our waiter was spot on with timing. After we ordered bread and butter was brought out. Which was good, would like butter softened and not so frozen. The food came out fast, mine was a big pile of onion rings on top of tempura sweet potatoes and green beans, on top of two pieces of breaded cod with a side of fries. It was a fried overload! Everything was good but if I knew the fish was breaded, I wouldn't have ordered. When I think fish n chips I think beer battered. The tempura sweet potatoes were my favorite thing on the plate. I thought the fries would at least be something special, like thick steak fries. Being British I suppose I have higher standards for my fish n chips.   We did have to send my husband steak back. He ordered medium rare it came out close to well done. It was a good quality steak seasoned well but was too done for him. Next steak came out quick, a little too quick, his steak was blue! He ate it because that was closer to how he likes and didn't want to wait again.  But I could hear the moos!    Since we saved on our meal we decided to try out some desserts. I had the creme brûlée, and I was disappointed to see a big pile of whipped cream on top of that crunchy sugar layer! I scrapped it off immediately but the damage was done. The hard top that you long to break was softened :( the outside rim still kept the crunch and was delicious! Told the waiter they need to serve the whipped cream, which was yummy, just on the side. My husband got tiramisu and well it was equally yummy!"}
{"text":"I love that they continued Chef Bernard's legacy. The restaurant is now called CB's Legacy... Same great food, same menu, same staff.. Hugo is our absolute favorite server in town! Besides the herb crusted rack of lamb we also come to see him.. We had the dungeness crab cake, very good portions comes with two.. Also ordered the French onion soup, the most delicious flavorful soup.. Main course was the herb crusted lamb, one of the reasons we keep coming back!! Beautiful presentation and amazingly delicious in flavor and texture.. Thank you Hugo for always giving us a pleasant and joyous experience at this French bistro!! See you again, cheers.."}
{"text":"First time eating here since it reopened.   Was as good as ever.  We lucked upon a beautiful evening for dining alfresco. The ambience is even better with very nice patio dining. The food and services were excellent.  So glad this restaurant is in our neighborhood.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Keep Chef Bernard's memory alive! My family and I have eaten here servers times and we love it! It is a special place to have in Henderson, the employees are so professional and obviously care about their customers and restaurant. We have enjoyed everything we have eaten. The ambience is  for us is quite comforting , usually quiet. The music on Sundays is always great and the singer and guitarist are actually knowledgeable about Bernard (Rest in Peace!) and even if the menu items. Please help support this restaurant so that it doesn't leave and get changed into something that closes down in 6 months such as every other restaurant previously in this location. We don't need another bar, Mexican, Chinese food place. We need to keep Legacy!  My son have the Scallops and frog legs and loved it and he is 10 years old! He also loved the coconut sorbet.  My husband had the salmon Wellington, I had the Filet mignon and we shared the tarte tartan and they were terrific. Most of all though, we love the casual upscale ambience and the excellent caring service from all staff."}
{"text":"Once again I had a delicious meal at CB's.  I also learned that they are now opened Tues.-Sat. from 7 a.m.-2 p.m. for $5.00 breakfasts and $6.00 lunches......and INCLUDES coffee and/or beverage.  Besides being such an attractive room to dine in, the food is really excellent.  Weekend Brunch Menu is still served on Saturdays and Sundays (sometimes along with guest entertainment).  What a great addition to the restaurants in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"When the original chef/owner passed away, I went into mourning.  However, his restaurant is open again under the name CB's (as in Chef Bernard) Legacy.  I ordered one of my favorite dishes, the shrimp avocado open-faced sandwich, and it is just as good as before. My friend ordered the Turkey-Brie open-faced and loved it.  The tiramisu was beautiful to look at with its edible orchid and tasted heavily, light and delicate and delicious.  You should come and soon."}
{"text":"Wow...great meal!  We met our Summerlin friends here for lunch.  (Did you know that there's a W. Sunset in Las Vegas and another W. Sunset in Henderson)?   The exterior was kinda bland but the interior was recently remodeled and very clean.  We started with some warm crisp ciabatta bread with generous butter along with Cajun Calamari.  I had the Mushroom and Chicken Crepes.  It was well prepared, savory and all our food came out together.  Overall, we had a great meal (thanks Rhonda) and enjoyed an unhurried and uninterrupted lunch and conversation with our friends.  We split the check and paid about $70 (1 appetizer, 2 plates, 2 sangrias, 2 deserts and coffee + tip and minus the %15 Yelp discount).  The coffee was strong but not bitter.  We'll be back.  Can't wait to take advantage of the specials during the week."}
{"text":"Fantastic steaks! We came here after a very disappointing birthday meal a few days before at Raku. This place is conveniently located right by our house. My husband had the ribeye with I believe mushrooms and blue cheese which he said was excellent. I had the filet mignon with shrimp scampi on top and that was excellent as well. I did not care for the ahi tuna appetizer, but everything else was so delicious. Our waitress Rhonda was very kind and attentive as well. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I went there once when it was Bernard's Bistro. I was pleased to find this restaurant is still open after Chef Bernard passed away. It is still very good, with the same menu and prices and the service was great. On Saturday night there was unobtrusive live music which made it very nice too. I had shrimp linguine and it was tasty! I like the ambiance, and decor too."}
{"text":"Food presentation is lovely; but quality and flavor are mediocre"}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Tonight I had lobster and chateaubriand. The filet portion was cooked exactly as I ordered it and the lobster tail had to be a 10 Oz tail perfectly broiled. They always have fresh made bread to go with my order of the best onion soup in town. Make your way here and enjoy the best restaurant Henderson has to offer. Rhonda is our preferred server, ask for her, relax and her do her magic"}
{"text":"We live in Henderson and haven't heard of CB's Legacy until recently. Once I told my friends we were going there everyone came out of the woodwork saying what a great place this is. Well it certainly lived up to the hype. Friendly and attentive staff. We had the tuna tartar and pickled beets with goat cheese for appetizers. If that was all we had, I would have been more than satisfied. But no, I had the whitefish with puff pastry (a special that I was told the chef only made eight of....lucky me). It melted in my mouth. My wife had the cannoli stuffed with braised filet. That dish had the right amount of balance with acidity and the savory beef. Even though we were stuffed, we had two cappuccinos which were made perfect a long with a piece of chocolate cake. We will certainly be back as we would like to try everything on the menu plus enjoy the wonderful dining experience again. One of my new favorite restaurants. Don't forget to ask about the first Wednesday of the month special wine pairing menu."}
{"text":"This place was really nice and everyone was super friendly. We went on  a Friday night for the Titanic dinner menu! The presentation of the food was amazing and the filet Mignon was the best! The wait staff really went above & beyond to please us! We will definitely go back for the brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas favorite set just minutes from the Airport in Henderson. The food is prepared to perfection both steaks and seafood alike. They have signature Caesar Salad that is delicious and big enough to share. They have several specialty nights like wine tasting and special course meals and they have special desserts with certain meals. I LOVE this place, loved it when it was Bernard's Bistro and LOVE it now! Seafood Wellington is amazing!"}
{"text":"Hate to be the bearer of bad news for CB's fans, but this restaurant is currently being rebranded and will no longer carry the CB's Legacy name. The menu has already been substantially changed downmarket, with all offerings now priced at $10 or less, and many of the old dishes are no longer available. (I will add pictures of the new menu after submitting this review - it's shocking how much they've changed it.)  The menu change was frustrating as I had made a reservation and specifically mentioned I was interested in trying the other dinner main courses (I'd previously visited during one of the wine tasting dinners and wasn't impressed with the food or service, but wanted to give CB's a second chance). It would have been nice to have been told about the menu changes rather than have to show up to the restaurant to find out that most (if not all) of those items had been removed in the downgrade.  Service was not improved from my last visit. It was much less crowded this time, but waiters seemed more interested in chatting with tables than providing actual service. As I mentioned in my last review, I understand that staff/management are trying for a friendly, neighborhood vibe - but when the service is so bad, it winds up coming across as insincere.  I hate giving local places a bad review (and especially one that seems to be struggling so much to find its identity and purpose). Despite my poor experiences here, I hope this restaurant - whatever it might be rebranded as - finds it way through troubled times.  EDITED TO ADD: Just saw the business owner response - unfortunately, no one bothered taking the time to explain any new \"concept\" to us, so the owner's confidence is misplaced. All we were told is that the menu had been adjusted downmarket and the CB's name will be dropped. It sure would have been nice if someone had discussed the changes with us at the restaurant - but like the failure to mention the changes when we made the reservation, not to mention the lacking service, that didn't happen. I still wish the restaurant the best with the new \"concept\"."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food (kids spaghetti, fish & chips, filet medallions, salmon special), and the prices are pretty good (~$30 for the filets, but the others were on early bird special...$9.99!).  Decent wine selection. Good neighborhood location. Friendly service. Unfortunately, something is lacking: not sure exactly what. Maybe it's the decor (which is eclectic in a weird way...ranging from Titanic memorabilia to generic \"kitchen\" stuff to 90's era \"modern\"). Maybe it's the menu, which somehow feels Sizzler-y. Or something in the ambiance, which gave me more of a feeling of an old person's place than a cute, local fine-dining type place. Too bad because I really want places like this to thrive (which it doesn't seem to be doing right now....on a Saturday evening, we were the only party in there most of the time). CB wants to be Todd's, but the menu isn't quite as creative, the ingredients aren't quite as fresh, and the execution isn't quite as good. Here's hoping they find a way to modernize a little!"}
{"text":"Yay! They are still in business!  A couple of weeks ago I was driving by and noticed that Bernard's had closed and was really disappointed. Then I saw on the Yelp talk boards that the restaurant would be re-opening as CB's Legacy. Last night we finally made it in to try out the new spot. There is a new owner, but everything else is still the same. The menu even still includes the favorites I enjoyed when the restaurant was Bernard's Bistro.  Service was really great last night. Service was very attentive. I could tell that the staff is very glad to be here and takes great pride in the restaurant. They definitely value their customers.   We started with the Knife & Fork Caesar and a glass of Riesling for me. The salad was really good and large enough for the two of us to share. My wine was delicious and paired well with my fish entrée.   My entrée selection was the Pan Roasted White Fish with Scampi. Everything about this dish was perfection. The fish was well prepared, the lobster sauce on top was delicious, and the large shrimp on top were well prepared. I loved the pesto mashed potatoes and veggies with a drizzle of tasty sauce as well. The portion was satisfying. My husband had the Cannelloni. He thought this was pretty good. This dish had \"surprise mushrooms\" not mentioned on the menu that slightly turned him off. It looked tasty to me.  The pricing at CB's Legacy is also reasonable for a nice meal. This isn't an inexpensive meal, but well priced for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This was Bernard's Bistro! Chef Bernard sold to a friend, but it's the same menu, same staff, same decor..so, for everyone who loved Bernard's Bistro, it hasn't gone away...just a new name and a new owner..."}
{"text":"Locals want to keep this excellent restaurant their secret; but it is just too good not to share. I promise you that there is not a restaurant in Las Vegas or Henderson that can top it in the presentation and  taste of every food item on the menu, service and price. Readers will notice that five stars are awarded on every review of this restaurant. I'd rate CB's Legacy at 10 stars if that option was available."}
{"text":"So delighted to have an early dinner at CB's Legacy.  Had dinner out with several friends.  We were all happy campers.  I tried the fish and chips.  Definitely not disappointed.  Also happy to find out  CB's now open for breakfast and lunch Tuesday through Friday.  You cannot beat the quality and prices"}
{"text":"Six of us went in to try Legacy -- we'd been to Bernard's numerous times and wanted to support the Legacy restaurant in his name. The dinner was okay -- not more tantalizing than that, but to our shock, on the itemized bill (not the one for signature) a 20% tip was added (now, understand, we were three parties of two), and on the signature page, there was a recommendation for a tip of from18 to 22%, without so much as a 'Bob's your Uncle' about the previously added amount. We strongly recommend that everyone look over your bill and march back in there, as are the six of us, and get the situation set right. Not a good way to start out, wethink.  Several weeks have gone by and we've let the management know of our disappointment.   We haven't been invited in, offered a refund or other normal reimbursement for the over charge.  Very surprising."}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro IS NOT CLOSED - JUST A NEW NAME - SAME GREAT FOOD AND MENU.Bernard died and it is now called CB's Legacy.  We had a fabulous brunch there Sunday May 22, 2016.  The service was attentive - not too much - lovely presentation of yummy food and the singer very nice to us.  Each of us enjoyed our meal and the Tiramisu was quite good!  We shall return..."}
