{"text":"I love this place! Best Greek food I've had in a long time. I grew up eating lots of Greek food and this is the best I've had in year. Please go there!!"}
{"text":"You walk into a tiny space crammed with cheap and unattractive tables and chairs and face a counter with a menu on the wall that would take a half-hour actually to read.  The staff behind the counter is friendly and you soon realize they know and are constantly joking with many of the customers.  So you place your order and they hand you your drink and a number tent for your table.  The food arrives quickly.  If the staff is not all family, they seem like it, and they seem to take pride in their quirky place.  It is the quality of the food, however, that exceeds expectations.  There is nothing new or creative on the menu: hamburgers, gyros, chicken, fish, etc.  But, for a luncheon diner, the quality is superb.  If you can ignore, or better yet, get into, the cramped, retro vibe, this is the best lunch in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Very simple place with counter service. Diverse menu that includes traditional Greek fare and american favorites. The Buffalo chicken salad is my favorite menu item.  Inside seating can be tight. Great pick for a night of carry out. It's also nice to sit outside on a sunny day.  I always see lots of families here, because a the menu truly has something for everyone."}
{"text":"I was craving for something greek with a pita and found this place nearby. The food was delicious. We ordered greek chicken pita and philly sandwich. The meat was flavorful and veggies fresh. I also liked the sauce in pita sandwich."}
{"text":"\"Great place for lunch.had the chicken gyro and souvlaki. fries were hot and crisp, sandwiches well seasoned and filling.service prompt and friendly.\""}
{"text":"Must stop here   I always stop for a quick Chicken Gyro on my to CLT airport. It's so good! I also think it's family run so why not support a small business!"}
{"text":"this place time and time again makes amazing food. Cheap and delicious, who doesnt like that? A very family oriented restaurant. i love coming here, great service, amazing french fries..Make sure to try the gyro!"}
{"text":"Would have enjoyed my meal more had I not had to kill a roach immediately upon sitting down."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. Staff is great. Nice place to go if you're looking for Greek food, but the menu truly has something for everyone. The grilled buffalo chicken salad is a favorite of mine. Healthy and super filling with tons of meat. Offers take out too."}
{"text":"This is a little gem!! My sister and brother in law told me I had to try their Greek chicken pita - man were they right!!! This place was awesome!! Great prices for a big portion!! I crave the Greek chicken pita all of the time.  This is a great family run business and we highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The cook was cleaning the floors with a garden hose and immediately started handling my food with bare hands.  I walked out needless to say"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Just got yelled at by who I believe to be the owner for trying to use a restaurant.com certificate for just me. I was still going to spend the full amount, just take home the leftovers. Way to discriminate against single people ... Will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my spot. It doesn't get much better than Big Bitez. It is definitely a local spot, but anyone that goes there once will make it into their own local spot because they'll keep coming back for more. John, Hellen and Dimitri are the best. So welcoming and friendly that every time I go to Big Bitez it feels like home. I've never had something bad, or even mediocre here. Everything is excellent. My favorite and my go to is the Greek chicken pita. The tzatziki sauce is out of this world and my girlfriend, who's Greek said it's one of the best gyro's she's ever had. The Greek salad is also huge and really good. The burgers, especially on pita bread are wonderful as well. You can't go wrong getting anything at Big Bitez. This is one of the best local places in the area. Don't miss out on it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this location to grab my usual Greek platter. Food was hot fast and ax always delicious. The Greek platter has a gyro and Greek salad gyro comes with fries which were hot crispy. Gyro has tons of meat and tzatziki sauce which is delicious this hit sour cream this us Greek yogurt based as it should pita bread was warm fluffy. I will continue stopping here or the one in mooresville which is my normal stop. They are friendly and food is homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"They win awards for good reason.  They have a very diverse menu.  It's very nice to know Big Bite'z serves authentic Greek food!  The staff is welcoming and they provide excellent service.  This place doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Eh... It's OK. I can't speak badly about the place. It certainly won't be seeing my return.  The food was edible. The environment was clean and friendly enough. But these are basic expectations. I require more for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This place is good. Their salads are large sized and really good. The gyros are average but still pretty darn tasty. If you are looking for a good lunch spot here it is."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in the Lake Norman area. The Greek chicken pita is the bomb! It's healthy. I could eat here seven days a week definitely a place to check out if you're thinking about what to do for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This place was \"okay\" too me.    Clearly it's a local favorite as it was insanely crowded.  Wayyyyy under staffed and not enough seating at all.   People were practically sticking their butts at other people's food because of how crowded it was.  While you wait (25 mins) for two dishes, you literally have to stand like sardines. DONT sit in the two tables in front of the registers.  Unless you want to feel squished by people.   Also there was no system for take out....   With the 15-20 people waiting, they should handing out numbers to call....   After 20 mins of waiting we finally decided to walk up to the counter and ask where our food was... Because the 4.... Yes FOUR people next to us all got their food before us, and they even sat down 5 mins after we did.   The food was \"eh\".  I had the steak sandwich, and it felt like I was chewing a slim job... Literally had to rip off every bite.    We probably won't be back"}
{"text":"If you can deal with the unwelcoming employees and owner you will be find the food to be superb. Try the Carolina Pita Burger or Buffalo Chicken salad."}
{"text":"My first gyro - delicious! The white sauce was bomb.  Normally I wouldn't step into a place like this, but after consistently seeing people always walking in and out and hearing good things, I decided to give it a try.  Service was friendly and quick to refill our drinks/take up trash. Gyro was amazing, though would love to see more exciting sides than fries and onion rings.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great Greek Diner  This is one of three Big Bite'z in the area.  This one is less than a mile from my house. The other two are in Mooresville and Indian Trail, all owned by the same family.  My wife, when she is busy and runs out of time, will stop here and pick up dinner for me.  It's a typical Greek Diner with Gyro's etc, along with some of the best Lamb dishes on the Lake and a Shrimp and Fish Platter that is great.  Had the seafood last week.  The food is very good, the portion size is so large that even large eaters like myself have trouble eating it in one setting and the prices are extremely reasonable.  Have not had anything from here that I did not like and i would recommend it to anyone.  Don't expect much on the outside but what's on the inside of this small storefront is worth it."}
{"text":"Super-busy, super-fast and very tasty lunch spot that reminds me of a crowded diner in New York City or New Jersey.  A family-run affair, Big Bitz offers everything from burgers to gyros and souvlaki. They also have some of the best fries around.  The interior isn't spacious, but it has character, with plenty of pictures of various city skylines and Greek maps lining the walls.  When it gets a bit too crowded inside, as it invariably does during the lunch rush, there are tables outside the front door as well.  My favorite combination is a tad boring but good: double cheeseburger combo. It comes out fast and hot, and disappears nearly as quickly.  I haven't tried the greek items on the menu, but I've been told by friends they are good eating as well."}
{"text":"Looking for the best gyros in town? Come here. Seriously. The place is owned by a Greek family and has the best attitude and service I've seen in a long time. I know I sound like an adman right now, but I was very surprised it took me this long to try this place. They have two locations and I'm not sure how the other one is.   The restaurant is located in a little sliver between other shops by the Gold's Gym in Cornelius. It's location is excellent for the lunch time rush to note. The menu is quite large and can be a little overwhelming, so it helps if you check out the menu online beforehand. I came to try their Flounder Dinner and gyros. The wait wasn't long at all and it was worth it. I forgot to take a picture of the gyro because it looked so darn good I couldn't help but munch in immediately.   Now imagine medium grade quality lamb that has flavor and doesn't squish in your mouth like rubber. Then take Showmars size and quantity (not their quality). Top it off with Tzatziki Sauce, chopped onion, and diced tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil. WOW. This beats Village Tavern gyros any day (as much as I like them too). I was thoroughly fulfilled and satisfied. All this and fries for less than $7. Can you beat that?!  The Flounder Dinner didn't disappoint either. Lightly battered with seasoning and used real flounder and not tilapia substitute. It was a little fishy in taste and smell, so the prep work needs a little improvement. That didn't take away from the meal though.  Price was around $7, so it wasn't thrilling but it was tasty.   I'm giving it four stars due to the service and quality of food; from what I ate at least and the time I went in. The owners are friendly and comical and have that Greek charm. Correct me if I'm wrong about their gyros, but I don't think you will.   I'll make sure to take a picture next time."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive food for a casual dining experience or a quick grab and go option. Don't let the modest look of the restaurant fool you: their food is good!  I don't eat gluten, so I get a burger without a bun.  My absolute favorite is the buffalo chicken salad.  This is not a wimpy meal and you won't be disappointed or hungry after you eat here.  The owners are very nice and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place several times over the past year and have found the service to be consistently poor. The food is three to four star good but the attitude of the employees/owner who normally take our order tends to be abrasive at best. I find this to be quite ironic as they have a sign behind the register saying that rude people will be charged extra, yet I have never heard a thank you or seen a smile from a cashier."}
{"text":"Rude employees. Food was mediocre. Customer service was terrible. While we were placing our order we were rushed. As server/cashier brought food to the table he threw the ranch."}
{"text":"I haven't tried everything on Big Bitez' menu, but what I have tried has always been good.  The burgers are quite flavorful...  This place does an incredible amount of business, and every time I go, there's a line to the door.  Very few empty tables will remain if you get there for lunch too late, so time it well!  The food is very similar to what you'd expect from Showmars, but with sometimes heartier proportions.  Only problems I've run into is that the owner has a thick accent which is hard to understand, and he isn't polite.  And he's often the first person you see when you walk in, so it's not welcoming.  His son might have a worse attitude, and mumbles.  I guess next time I just have to tell them to speak up like normal humans.  Don't let that stop you from going though - if you've eaten anywhere in this area, you've had to deal with ignorance like this; it's pretty commonplace.  The food, however, is a little bit better than what you'd expect from such a tiny little restaurant tucked next to a terrible Dollar Tree store."}
{"text":"The mistake I made in coming here was going to a REAL Greek Restaurant (The Mad Greek) first.   This place SUCKS! Sorry but thats the most accurate description I can give this place to help other customers AVOID it! The service is blah! And the food is DRY DRY DRY!   My Gyro was so small and pathetic and they're very stingy with the meat! The Tenderloin tips were just as bad! DRY DRY DRY! I can't think of anything positive to say about this place. I have no idea how they have so many good reviews. Gotta be friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a quick dinner. We were pleasantly surprised by the super fast service considering it was pretty crowded. I ordered the calabash shrimp as it was the special. Great homemade slaw and tartar sauce! Shrimp were fried perfectly without being greasy. My husband ordered the gyro and it was delicious. HUGE portions and a great price. Food has a ton of flavor. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pita was amazing! Came with fries, portion for meal was huge. Great quality ingredients in food. Husband got the steak sandwich and the steak was an actual steak, not that shaved beef product. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband found this restaurant oh about 4-5 years ago. We love going there the atmosphere is wonderful the people are kind and funny. We really enjoy the food and continually go back. I like it better than the either Greek restaurant down the road."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this is a great place for a Gyro.  It's a local place and I always go out to support.  Unfortunately we sometimes forget that it is here.     When we come we always select the gyros.  They are quality for a good price."}
{"text":"Love love love this little family owned Greek restaurant. There are two locations: Cornelius and Mooresville. Great prices, great tasting food and large helpings. You will always see John or Helen at the stores who are the owners. They believe in hard work and it shows with their dedication to their business. The Greek Chicken Plate is my go-to always. My husband loves the chicken tenders and shrimp. Their sweet tea is great too!"}
{"text":"Food always good, quick and inexpensive! Gyros, chicken pita, Greek salad, burgers and fries.  They offer specials daily check the menu outside"}
{"text":"There is something about their chicken salad and the accompanying pita, I just enjoy it so much....could be the great side of fries. ;) The food here is consistently good, not rockin', but good. The Gyro is also good, but growing up going to a Greek Orthodox school, I've definitely had better. The tatziki is good. If you want better service, do not call it a GI-RO. Repeat after me: Year-ro. That'll will help you get a little more attn from the kids (they belong to the owners)  cuz they are easily distracted."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out and we're glad we did! Probably the best chicken pita I've ever had. Quick and friendly service too! Only took a star off because my side portion was small."}
{"text":"Great gyros, usually great service. Unless the old man is at the counter. He could ruin orphan's day at Disney world. Dude answered his phone as soon as I started ordering."}
{"text":"Food is ok it depends on what you order and when. I have visited at different times during business hours. They seem to be very busy at Lunch. Plan to be a little late getting back if you go during lunch or order in ahead of time.  Dinner can be just as busy depending on what night of the week it is. Lived in the area for many years and have eaten here many times. I have not been back due to the attitude of the employee who works the front.Grumpy is a good word to describe this man.  When it came time  to ask for a refill ( because there is so much Ice in the cup a large is a small) no one there to ask. Disappeared in the back. Never saw them again. Even saw someone fill their own drink ,which is what I did as well. It was about an hour to closing time so I wrote it off to that. I feel like the locals visit this place and best buds get the best service. the location is Mooresville is just as good. Service is good and never had an attitude. The lady is always cleaning."}
{"text":"During my four year stay in the North Carolina area I failed to find another dining experience which could rival Big Bite'z. Upon entering \"The Bite'z\" you instantly become a member of the loving Greek-American family which own the restaurant. John and Helen go out of their way to remember not only your name but also your favorite meals. The original cherry coke is incredible and the greek chicken pita is delicious. Simply put, you gotta go the the Bitez."}
{"text":"More than just a burger place.  I seriously thought this was just a burger place, until someone asked if we wanted to go to the Greek place.  Greek?  I had no idea.  I have to say my favorite has been the Grecian Combo salad...salad with all the meat!  So good!  I have also had the popcorn shrimp...I know, not Greek, but was what I wanted and was really good.  I have so much I want to try as I drool over passing plates...gyro, burger, hotdog, etc.  Why not, it is almost always packed and such a hidden gem.  I hate to say I lived in this city for over 10 years and just found it in 2014.  The Greek owners are so nice and love to chat (if they can).  It is a great affordable, fast meal.  The name doesn't really do this place justice, but try it out and you won't care what it is called.    This is my strip mall gem in Cornelius.  Check them out and maybe I'll see you there.  They have daily specials, so go often.  Great lunch spot too."}
{"text":"Great Greek salad w/ Gyro meat!"}
{"text":"In the same shopping center as the Peak Fitness.  They have great gyros, not so great burgers and hot dogs, and of lot of other things I've never tried."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to big bitez and I will definitely be a new regular! The woman behind the counter, who I presume to be the owner or a relative of, is such a sweet friendly lady and an awesome conversationalist lol. However, outside of their great customer service (which I applaud because it's so rare these days) their food is really yummy! I was in the mood for a burger on my lunch break (something chargrilled and made to order, not mcdonalds or Wendy's) and they hit the nail on the head! I've also gotten their Greek chicken salad which was also very good and plentiful. They don't embellish with all of the bells and whistles (paper plates and cups), it's very simple and casual, but if you're in the mood for a fun family vibe, good quick food, and a place you can kick back to enjoy your lunch break, this is it!"}
{"text":"Now this good food done right!!! Greek, burgers, fish, salads what ever you get here is GREAT!!! And will be served with a big smile from John or Dimetri... BEST in TOWN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly pretty good - family run Greek diner! Fast service, hot, and well prepped food...   I had the gyro plate and there was plenty of food for the price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Lunch Spots. The owners are amazing people and the food is spectacular.  I can recommend everything and you can even call ahead if your in a hurry! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing, sooooo yummy from the buffalo tenders to the fried pork chops. But it is honestly really annoying to dine in and hear these 2 ladies \"working\" but they're just talking showing pictures on their phones not paying attention to customers... it's so annoying. I don't want to hear your conversation! Anytime the 2 younger men are in there it's fine, they are much more professional than these 2 ladies that were in there today.... they were just annoying... Blows my mind that businesses stay alive and pay employees to chit chat and play around all day. We'll always come back, but maybe get it to go next time."}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I stopped in for our first visit for lunch based on all the great reviews.  Double hamburger and gyro sandwich we're good. As a military retiree and card holder, I asked older fella at register if they offered a military discount.  He seemed offended and stated that their food is already cheap so no discounts.  The prices of the items on their menu are average, but definitely not cheap.  The Mrs. asked for a cup of tap water when we ordered and we were charged 60 cents for the small cup which was a surprise.  Our table hadn't been bussed and was filthy.  We used some of the 60 cent tap water to clean our table ourselves.  Overall, decent food, not extraordinary.  Because of the water charge and dirty tables we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"So why did it take so long for me to try Big Bite'z???  Well, for one, I didn't know it existed but I sure am glad I do now!  Think Showmar's only better with more of a family feel.  Very much a Greek diner type of place with the usual suspect Gyro's, Souvlaki, Greek chicken pitas and salads.    There is more to the menu however with burgers, fish and shrimp, steak sandwiches, etc.  The Gyro is very good, served with lettuce, tomato, onion and yogurt sauce and it is HUGE!  The homemade onion rings are certainly better than the frozen out of a bag variety but are not truly outstanding.  Given the quality, value and proximity to home, I can see Big Bite'z being on my regular rotation going forward."}
{"text":"Ordered up the buffalo chicken pita and the triple cheeseburger last time around! Before you think whoa!! You ate all that! They use the small patties like in/out burger ( my west coast peeps) I like the wings here too, pretty good flavor and nice size (not the puny pinky finger size) This place is close to home, convenient, and pretty good prices. They have specials daily which are pretty good! Pleasant greetings upon arrival to pick up order and I have also tried several quite a few of the other menu items. I'd suggest this place on for your food fix when you don't feel like cooking or ready to try some fresh onion rings ( awesome here) a gyro, pita or salad.. Haven't gone wrong yet! No pics this time as I was not thinking of providing evidence of the crime... ( assault n battery) on a burger."}
{"text":"Why does Big Bite'z only have 4 reviews? the food here is great!! I work close by and a co-worker introduced me to this place recently. I've gone back at least once every week since then, and so far I've only had the chicken gyros. Yes, it's that good! sometimes I'll have it as a sandwich, and sometimes as a salad, the way they cook/grill the chicken is just amazing, it's so flavorful and totally soul satisfying! I can't even get myself to try anything else on the menu just yet.. but I will, in due course of time... may be! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very quick service.  Great place to stop and eat or order out when pacing through.  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great Greek pitas. Every time I have been here it's always been quick and friendly service.  Best around, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Yes it's next to a gas station who cares. I would trave miles in 6 feet of snow to get food from here. Love this place. Best Greek food around. The staff is friendly and the rest unanticipated is very clean."}
{"text":"Great local dining experience, portion sizes are spot on.  Best Pitas in the area Helen and John are the owners very friendly.  Rib eye steak sandwich is the best around can't go wrong with it?"}
