{"text":"So if you are looking for that great kind of place where you and your pals can walk in and grab a stool or table in the shadow of a Pittsburgh icon and a beloved university, belly up at The Cafe Fifth Ave. Sharing the neighborhood with the home of the Pens and the Dukes it was a great place for a bunch of seasoned college friends to tip a few, grab a bite, and catch up.  The propieter and staff couldn't have made us feel more comfortable. Service was fast friendly and satisfying. During a Pens game I am sure the dynamics change to a friendly fury reminicent of Oakland back in the storied Forbes Field days.  No pretence, all substance, 100% Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"horrible service. do NOT go before any event at consol, especially pens games. not equipped, size or staff wise, to handle crowd & crowd is there either for, or to go, to the game.  No turnover of tables.

when entered we were put on the waiting list as #2. 30+min later saw 2 tables be seated?!?!  some how we were moved to #3. When i asked hastess she asked the guy that created the waiting list, \"she thinks she was #2.\" Meanwhile hostess was right there when we came in & were put on the list, the guy with the list now said that \"nancy\" was really here b4 us & she needed to be added to the list. so on a busy night they remember everyone's name that checks in, waiting for a table? The hostess didn't remeber anything but this guy remembered eveyone? This same guy then told me  that there were other places to go & that they didn't need our business. certainly never will get my business being this disrespectful to customers & questionable honesty."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of pretending I don't hate this place. It's old and filthy. The menus still advertise their St Patrick's Day specials (I am writing this in October). The food is not good. (Who makes a quesadilla with jarred jalapeños and canned black beans?) Their chicken tenders aren't even any good. Their beer selection is decent, but unfortunately that's about the only thing good I can say about this place. That, and the location."}
{"text":"Fiance got a pretty good burger. I made the mistake of ordering the buffalo fish sammy....it changed the molecular structure of my stomach for 2.5 days....pretty sure I paid $12 bucks for a plate of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Café 5th is one of the few choices around Consol and since our favorite moved out of Washington Place, we have been trying the few different places around Consol before the Pens games.  I like the atmosphere at Café 5th and the food is not bad.  They have recently had a change of ownership and increased beer prices.  I do think 5.00 for a Coors Light is pushing it, even for this location.  The bartenders are attentive so that is a plus.  I understand they are in transition, thinking of more TVs on the wall, and hoping for some speakers for pregame music from the jukebox so one has to give it a chance, especially with the few selections to eat in the area.  I am not one to eat French fries but the basket of fries is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is another of of those, \"If it wasn't for the convenient location, I doubt it would exist\" kind of places. Of course the location I'm referring to is about a block away from the Consol Energy Center, home of the NHL's best franchise (no debate necessary).

After witnessing an amazing come-from-behind Penguins win, I followed a small crowd in here for a post-game drink. I first thought the outside sign said \"Cafe Filth,\" which immediately made me go \"Huh?\" However, once I went inside I realized my silly error, but decided to stay anyway.

There's not a whole lot to say about this place...standard beer selections, generic decor, decent service and enthusiastic crowd. When it comes down to it, I think there are only two reasons to pop in: to celebrate a win or drown your sorrows after a loss. Other than that, move along."}
{"text":"As a Pens season ticket holder, I was excited to find a close bar with good food and draft beers. However, after a broken glass to the lap, terrible cocktail sauce for my shrimp and a \"$3.50 seasonal draft special\" which did not include the only seasonal draft they had on tap, I will not be back. Oh, and if you are not a regular, good luck getting a beer."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the service was average. We were one of two tables and were in there for over an hour waiting for food and then checks. Their fish sandwich is huge and I had the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Great spot in a great location right downtown.  Huge place with tons of room and great specials.  All of the staff is really friendly and accommodating.  The provolone moons are the BEST appetizer ever, make sure to get a few orders of those.  I have been there for lunch as well as happy hour with friends and I definitely recommend for those looking for good bar food and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar for before/after games. Very good food. Not the best, but it's a bar. If you want a fancy restaurant, this is clearly not a good option, but if you want a good meal before the game or concert and some drinks with good prices, this is a very good option around CONSOL Energy Center."}
{"text":"New owner and new things happening- worth coming in for a drink and appetizer! Comfortable environment and beat prices near Consul Energy Center! Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place in which to grab a beer or a bite to eat before an event at the Consol Energy Center. I like their popcorn shrimp and wings best. The prices are affordable, and the service is always good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Decent food and great portion sizes. We stopped in after a Pens game...wasn't too crowded and we got our food pretty quickly. We'd definitely go back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"OK bar food, wings are pretty good, only worth going to because it is really close to the Mellon Arena on Fifth Ave. Gets very crowded before/after/during Pens games."}
{"text":"Best locally owned bar in the area. 
Great bar food, wings and pizza are great. Hostess is very helpful when finding previously seated friends. Never had a bad item from the menu."}
{"text":"Great little spot near the Arena for lunch or some drinks and a quick bite before a game. I went here on the suggestion of a co-worker for lunch one afternoon and we liked it so much we have gone back a few times now. The have daily specials which usually includes a wrap of some sort. First I tried the Spicy Chicken wrap which was incredibly good. Actually scratch that...it was one of the best wraps I've ever had...hands down!!!  I don't know exactly what they did to this thing but if it is on special, get it!  Next I tried the Tune Melt wrap during Lent and while it was still good, it didn't quite hit the level of awesome that the Spicy Chicken did.  I'm okay with just getting the homemade chips but they also have a fry option with the wraps or a few subs like Onion Rings for an up charge. Speaking of charge, these wraps are a pretty big portion for around an $8 price tag.  Service has always been fast and friendly. It just seems like a good crew here during the day.

I'm not sure how things are for the dinner crowd but they look to have some really great happy hour and game day drink specials."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a bite before the pens game. We asked the waitress what was on special or for happy hour and she directed us to the beer portion of the menu. Spoiler alert: nothing was special and it was unhappy hour.

I had the Buffalo chicken salad. I was disappointed the ranch was just some bottled nonsense put into a plastic container and not homemade. The fries (because a salad in the Burgh without fries is a waste) were perfectly fried and crispy but soft on the inside. The chicken was delicious! Pretty sure the Buffalo sauce was just Frank's and you can't go wrong with that. 

Overall the service was good, the food decent and the beer selection good as well. It just wasn't anything to write home about but definitely worth stopping by before a game!"}
{"text":"I walk past here on my way to and from work every day and I've been telling myself that I need to stop in for lunch or dinner someday. Well today is \"someday\".

Unlike other reviews on here, I stopped in for lunch on a day and a time when there was nothing going on at the Consol. There were only 20 some other people in the establishment while I was there making it like any other restaurant on any given day. 

Overall I'd have to say that this bi-level tavern is a comfortably roomy place with brass railings, wooden paneling half way up the walls and hardwood floors. It has that \"mature\" appearance and feel to it. As of this writing 6 out of the 10 taps are pouring craft beers and the bar appears to be well stocked with all of the major brands of booze.

Sitting at the bar, as I usually do when I dine solo (as I usually dine), I ordered a raspberry ice tea and decided to go with the special of the day: the flat iron steak with broccoli and hash browns that was advertised on a sign parked outside the door. 

It took a little over 10 minutes for my order to make its way in front of me. I cut into the steak and wha'la, cooked to perfection. The steak was melt in your mouth awesome and screaming with flavor. The hash browns were browned and lightly peppered while the broccoli was bright green and steamed retaining a slight crunch. Delicious!

My billed totaled to $12.74 plus tip. 

With so many restaurants popping up on the Pittsburgh foodie radar, it's easy to forgo the tried and true established establishments. I found my lunch at Café Fifth to be one of the better values for your buck while satisfying my inner foodie."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before a hockey game to grab a bite to eat and some beers. Recently had a not so great experience though. There were no beer specials for the game. I ordered pizza and my husband ordered the Italian hoagie. The pizza was terrible, no flavor in the dough and it had a strange soap taste to it. The Italian hoagie was alright, nothing to get excited over. We were pretty bummed because we've stopped here before and had better experiences."}
