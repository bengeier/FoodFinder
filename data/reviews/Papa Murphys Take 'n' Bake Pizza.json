{"text":"Great pizza. Cooking it yourself ensures its hot when ready to eat. Very convenient."}
{"text":"Pizza is good!Great customer service.And you can't beat the prices.The Cowboy and the garlic and spinach is very good!"}
{"text":"Their pizza itself is delicious.  The concern I have is with their staff and their ability to follow directions.
Called an order in.  Asked for peppers, onions, and tomatoes on the whole pizza.  Then, artichokes on half and chicken on the other half.  Well when I picked the pizza up, there were veggies and chicken on one half, and just artichokes on the other.

Took the pizza anyway.  Maybe should have raised a bigger stink.  On the other hand, the vibe I got from the person taking the order was new.  It happens."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murhpy's Pizza I have been eating Papa Murphys 1-2 times a month for the last 25 years! I like most of the staff there but Several times I go to use a coupon and its expired and this one lady won't accept it.  Even though they always have the same coupons all the time. It's a little frustrating because the other locations on Cactus and Union hills always take them even if they are expired."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The staff is always friendly and the pizza is awesome. If you have never tried their pizza I recommend trying them out on a Tuesday when all large pizzas up to 5 toppings are only $10! It's a great deal."}
{"text":"This is the best thing since....... (fill in a good word)

You get where i am going with this!

Only place i can find taco pizza in az (Im very midwest!) And I LOVED IT

The smore pizza was to die for. It's cheap... Delicious... and 100000 times better than dominos and digornio! 

Also they take food stamps for those who have them!"}
{"text":"We don't usually get Papa Murphy's Pizza mainly because when we get pizza it's because I am lazy and don't want to cook.

Today my son had a half day at school and was starving when I picked him up from school. He loves the Mini Murph and at $4.00 we think it's a pretty good deal. It's fresh and he eats it. 

The times I have visited this location all of the employees have been pleasant and courteous. They are patient when I have questions and today they gave me a $2.00 off coupon. Store is always emaculate. Veggies always fresh. 

Is it the best pizza you will ever have in your life? Nope. But for the money and the amount of choices they have it's a good alternative to frozen DiGiorno and it doesn't cost anymore.
Cookie dough and salads are a good addition and the Cinnamon Wheel and Cheesy Bread are both excellent. Highly recommend the Taco Pizza!"}
