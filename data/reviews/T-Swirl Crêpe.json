{"text":"This is the first shop to open in Canada. Its hiding in the corner of the small s unionville plaza. Walking in the employee greets you with a smile on her face and offers you to look at their menu. Though most people think of sweets when they think of crepes, T-swirl also offers a selection of savory crepes. I went with my girlfriend and we got the Matcha Azuki Bean with truffles. Make sure you all the truffles in your dessert crepe, its the x factor of the crepe and its made in house. The crepe is not like the stuff you get at demetres. Your first bite and you realize the crepe is crispy, ice cream melts in your mouth, and you end it all with a bite of their in house truffle. The portion is very generous and the flavors just work so well together. You be missing out to not give this place a try."}
{"text":"The store had a great atmosphere. The employees were kind and had a smile on their face! The only issue I had was the amount of seats and table available. Other than that, still had a great experience since the crepe was beautifully made and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here when one of my friends asked me to try this place out.  It was a little bit hard to find and defiantly easy to miss as it was literally tucked inside a little corner.  Seating is very limited however the interior was pretty spotless.  The menu had a hand full of choices with both sweet and savory crepes. 

Food took almost 10 min to make but it was worth it.  I ordered the banana chocolate crepe and everything from the crepe to the fruits were really fresh. Price is  reasonable only complain is that they didn't come with ice cream which had to be added on separately, which i thought waa included with most crepes.  Will come back to try the savory crepes next time."}
{"text":"Excellent service
The food is great.
I went there twice. Once with my two boys and once with my mom. We all enjoyed the creative combinations of fruit and  vegetables and their unique sources. Blueberry cheese cake and BLT are my favorite ones. Definitely, will come back again."}
{"text":"New crepe place in town. Had the Matcha Azuki Bean, and it was delicious. Will try the savory smoked salmon next time."}
{"text":"Crepes are great and fresh! They have a special promotion, if you post a review on Yelp or share a picture of your crepe on Facebook or Instagram, you'll get a free scoop of ice cream!"}
{"text":"Cool place for crepe friend ordered banana nutella and i got salmon one. Friendly staff and ambience is good too."}
{"text":"A relative had recommended this place and at first I couldn't find the store because of how new it was but I eventually found it and I was not disappointed.
(Tip: since it's so new the easiest way to find it is to stand in front of chick-on and you should see it in the corner)

The crepe I had order was the matcha chocolate truffle and it was fantastic, the combination consisted of cream, chocolate syrup, strawberry, pistachio, chocolate truffle (that was perfectly rich and smooth) and matcha cream in delightful crunchy crepe."}
{"text":"Came here on my way home after work, got the banana chocolate, and green tea icecream, soooo gooood! The sweet level was at the perfect level, fruits were fresh too!  Will bring my coworkers here next time yo"}
{"text":"This by far the best crepe place I have tried. We were just walking through Yonge and didn't think much of it, but was I surprised. The choices are amazing and the time the take to make it for you, you know your getting a quality meal for a decent cost. Highly recommended, don't let the time it takes fool you.. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This crepe place is my new fave! It has so many options to choose from! My favourite is banana and Nutella! And my boyfriend loves the mango raspberry! We come here often and would definitely recommend this dessert place in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a newer crepe place that popped up. I decided to check it out and ordered the Nutella banana crepe with strawberries. It was really delicious. A bit pricey as the total came to around $10. The crepe was really sweet and rich. There are also savoury crepes as well if you prefer. I would visit again but maybe as a once in a while treat. There isn't really much of a seating area so I suggest taking this to go."}
{"text":"Two stars.. can make it 3  stars due to my negligence.

A relative new place, a nice décor outside, only store outside of NY, Japanese style crepe in an Asian community.. 
It can be an alarming sign when there is no line up.. Since  I am a big fan of crepe with ice cream, I will go for it.

The Positives: 
+Size was great, the matcha crème was awesome!
+Crepe was nicely done

The Negative: 
-relatively pricey, though it wasn't unreasonable
-slow service, waited for 30 minutes when there is only 5 orders in front of me
-POOR attitude!! SERVICE

The story:
I wanted to order the  Matcha Azuki Bean ($9.95)..I pointed to the picture and read the name.  The Cashier punched in the  Matcha truffle (8.95) for me.  Well , I could have catch it but seriously, I just assume everything is correct and paid up.  Once I got the crepe and took a small bite, I realized that it was the Matcha truffle (the one without the ice cream).  I went back and ask for the gelator.  Man, The attitude was so RUDE! The cashier insisted I ordered Match Truffle and keep trying to prove it. It's more like how she was programmed to punch in order #5 whenever she hears the word Matcha.  I only took a tiny bite and not like I m being difficult asking for  completely different flavor after finishing half of the crepe. 

Well, maybe I should have check the price before I paid.. 
 
Yet, they could handle this a tad better...could have ask me to pay the difference and slap the gelato on my crepe, no?  Sorry, no returning"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brough me here for crepes and we used the BOGO coupon she received in the mail to get an Angus Short Rib and a Smoked Salmon crepe. The short rib was very tender, sweet and delicious. Overall, my first experience here was great and I would return again."}
{"text":"The Japanese style crepe just locates one block from my home, they offer both sweet and savory crepes. I have tried matcha chocolate truffles?chocolate nut party, and fruits cocktail. They were all good tasted, and the fruits in the sweet crepes are super fresh. They taste so good with the custard cream and whipped yogurt. I recommend the fruits cocktail which is my favorite. And I will definitely go back to try the savory one for next time?"}
{"text":"T-Swirl Crêpe is a crêpe shop located outside the Langham Square plaza. They offer sweet and savoury crêpes.

Food:
We ordered the Matcha Chocolate Truffles and Blueberry NY Cheesecake Crêpes. The first few bites were actually quite nice, however, both crêpes were cold. After a while, the crêpes became soggy and there were no more toppings towards the end. The toppings were not proportionate with each bite and there seemed to be bits of flour in the crêpes. The Matcha Chocolate Truffles was our favourite out of the both of them. The crêpe had Sliced Strawberries, Chocolate Truffles, Matcha Custard Cream, Whipped Yogurt, Chocolate Sauce, and Crushed Pistachio. I wanted more matcha custard cream as it was only drizzled at the top. The Blueberry NY Cheesecake crêpe was not that good. The crêpe had Blueberries, Blueberry Reduction, Whipped Cream Cheese, Custard Cream, Whipped Yogurt, Vanilla Ice Cream, Almonds, and Chocolate Pocky Sticks. The vanilla ice cream was not creamy and did not have a tasty flavour. The blueberries were sour and did not taste fresh. 

Service: The service was okay. The workers are nice but super slow. We waited more than thirty minutes to receive our crêpes and we were the only ones there. Maybe that's why our crêpes came out cold.

I wouldn't recommend going to T-Swirl Crêpes. The prices are high and the crêpes did not taste good."}
{"text":"It is a nice place. Even though it is a little space, they have varieties of items. I order strawberry and banana. It is good. The cream is very good. They say they are Japanese crepe, but I find it different from original Japanese crepe because crepes in this place are very crispy. They have seats, but the place does not mean to stay long for eat and chat. It looks like a take out place."}
{"text":"Love love love the crepes here! We had #21 the salmon one and I could have eaten 3 more it was so good. Then for dessert we had the NY Blueberry Cheesecake one. I don't think you could go wrong with any of your choices. Very clean location, all the staff interacted with were very friendly and I'm still craving their crepes."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Saturday night for early dinner and early dessert. I'll be honest , I probably would have been okay with having a sweet crepe sandwich as my dinner. As a hugeeeeeee huge huge caramel apple crumble pie lover, my eyes immediately drew to the Fuji caramel apple crepe. I mean, I considered the other options such as the matcha wrap and the ny cheesecake wrap, but I'm not a fan of whipped cream and I didn't really feel like having ice cream. Moreover, my friend didn't want something overly heavy because we were already sharing a savoury wrap. She wrinkled her nose at the sight of Raisinssss in the description, but we trusted the chefs at t-swirl to come up with the perfect tasty combination of flavours. Andddd man oh man.... was I impressed. Upon first bite, I knew this was it. It was like having a bite of warm, soft, caramelly thin apple slices with the sweet goodness of sugar and cinnamon within layers of thin crepe. I actually liked how the crêpe created layers and layers with in the wrap. It gave the wrap structure.  It gave the wrap some texture. And more importantly, it's soaked up all the juicy sauces. Which brings me to my next point. You gotta eat this quick !!! If you're a slow eater, hurry up! Because the wrap gets mushy after a while. It's not something you can 'save for later'. Plus , it's way tastier when it's fresh and warm! :) 

The angus short rib was also amazing, but in a savory way. There weren't that many pieces of short rib, but just enough sprinkled throughout the wrap. The short ribs were, however, very soft, tender, and melted in your mouth.  The sauce was quite tasty, but it would've been better if there was less sauce. I liked how there were crunchy green beans and red peppers added to the wrap to give it some texture. Again, I really liked how the multiple layers of tasty crepe gave the wrap some structure. 

Overall, I really liked tswirl creperie. I hope they come up new and more interesting combinations for next time! :)"}
{"text":"Totally worth coming by here. I ordered the Matcha chocolate truffle and it was delicious. It wasn't too sweet, the chocolate drizzle with chocolate truffles balanced well with the matcha cream. I am definitely coming back tomorrow to try the Blueberry NY Cheesecake one. They also serve lunch options."}
{"text":"Came here for an after work snack and was very disappointed.  

I ordered the chocolate nut party for take out, and it took a while for me to get my order.  It wasn't that busy (I was 2nd in line), and I stood there for a good 15 minutes for them to make this tiny crepe.  I didn't find them to be very generous with their toppings, and the ice cream was the size of a golf ball.  The taste was ok - but nothing to write home about.

The take out container is also in this paper Cone with a plastic lining in it - which makes sense because it's supposed to prevent leaking.  But this also made it REALLY HARD to rip it open as you start getting to the bottom of the cone wrapped crepe, and the perforated lines don't help.  So you end up getting ice cream drips all over yourself anyway.

On top of that - this crepe was not cheap!  About $12 with tax!  At least the staff were friendly and the place is quite cute and modern.

I won't be coming back.  Would much rather go to Caffe Demetres and get a generous portion of yummy crepe and waffles for about the same price."}
{"text":"Hands down probably the best crepe I have ever had in my life so far! It's not just the taste and texture of the crepe but also the way it is presented. It looks delectable and pretty at the same time; I almost didn't want to eat it (lol). There are two type of crepes you can order: sweet or savoury. The sweet crepes are great for dessert and the savoury crepes are great for a light snack (check out pictures for the variety of sweet and savoury crepes).

I personally ordered the Wild Berries sweet crepe which is $9.45+tax. Inside is sliced strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, custard cream, whipped yogurt, chocolate pearls, and granola. The first bite will get you hooked! Not only is it filled with fruity goodness but the custard and yogurt bursts into your mouth with creamy goodness which adds to flavours. The texture of the crepe is just right too; perfectly balanced, not too hard and not too soft.

I'm definitely coming here again whenever I am in Markham. It's a great dessert place and I can't wait to try the other crepes!"}
{"text":"T-sqirl crepe just opened and I took the opportunity of their grand opening offer of 20% off all of their crepes. I ordered the strawberry matcha crepe and it was delicious! The crepe took a bit of time to prepare and the workers were a bit slow. They had three people help to construct one crepe and still took a long time. The crepe itself was filled with chocolate truffles, vanilla and matcha cream, strawberries and chocolate sauce. I was disappointed about the fact only two strawberries were sliced and used in my crepe. Very little of the toppings were actually put in the crepe itself. The price as well was a bit of a turn off. The crepe cost $9.75 normally and the discount including tax was $8.10. It wasn't even filling so I had to go to Cha me Cha to get a bubble tea. I would probably come again to try it out with different friends, but I won't be going out of my way to eat crepes here again. 

~Great wifi
~A lot of delicious flavours, both sweet and savoury
~Good music"}
{"text":"Heard about the promotion due to their 2nd year anniversary. Thinking $2 a crêpe is worth to try but ended up $3 instead.  The line up doesn't look that long but it takes approximately 45mins before I can order and roughly 15mins  before I can get my food. It is as expected for the line up and time for this type of promotion so that's fine. But they may need better system and be more efficient on making their orders since 15mins per order is a bit long consider it's not much cooking involved. 

Tried the Lychee Romantic (lychee,  raspberry) and Matcha Azuki bean (green tea ice cream, strawberry, red bean).  The crêpe tastes good but I don't see much red bean on my Matcha azuki bean crêpe. The lychee one tastes good as well but better if they can put more fruits there.  Lychee and raspberry both sweet.  

Overall,  I like the crêpes but I don't know if I will pay for $9 each if regular price. Maybe next time I will try their savory menu even thou it's slightly more expensive than the sweet side."}
{"text":"Been there couple of times , its taste amazing specially I am in love with strawberry banana crepe. It's crispy and crunchy with of course yummy. Moreover the staffs are so polite and they will make ur day be greeting very warmly . Thank U coming to Toronto"}
{"text":"Best crepes in Toronto, both the savoury and sweet offerings are delicious. Recommended to come here in pairs for a meal; grab two savoury crepes and finish with a shared sweet dessert. Two is a bit too much for one person to handle but with such amazing crepes it's impossible to resist the temptation of each type."}
{"text":"Their soft opening is today and they are doing a 20% discount. Even with the discount it's about 10$ after tax, still expensive. They have savory crepes and sweet ones.

I had the blueberry cheesecake and it was disappointing. The ice cream was vanilla and the crepe had cream cheese in it... It woulda been better if the ice cream had been cheesecake flavor. I would not come back.

Fyi This is a franchise."}
{"text":"It's not often you see crepe store around the block. T-Swirl recently opened along Yonge. I've been always walking pass it but was never hungry enough to stop by.

The crave dawned on me after work, so my partner in crime and I walked in. We were happily greeted by the employees there while they worked away making crepes. You would notice the restaurant's interior is modern-styled but on the simple side. Throughout our stay there, the place filled up (only three main tables) yet the noise level wasn't bad.

T-Swirl offers two types of crepes: sweet and savoury. We ordered one of the two matcha crepes - Matcha Azuki Bean. It consists of strawberries, red bean, matcha ice cream, matcha custard cream, whipped yogurt, almonds, and of course two chocolate pocky sticks!

Even though it was slightly pricey at $10, we loved the crepe texture and how evenly spread all the ingredients were within each crepe layer. You wouldn't just feel like eating crepe dough by itself. Overall it's not too sweet yet not too bland. Secondly, you can tell that the staff took patience and time to decorate the ingredients neatly and properly before serving. You basically pay for what you'd get.

I'd definitely recommend trying this dessert place out. I can't comment what happens down the road after months into launch, but it's worth eating it right now!"}
{"text":"Really great crepes and nice people! Highly recommended! I ordered a matcha red bean ice cream and it was the best I've had since had crepes in japan. The service is very fast and the dessert is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:

- Excellent presentation
- Nice ambiance
- Excellent service
- Great Taste
- Decently priced

Cons:

- None"}
{"text":"A great variety of savoury & sweet crêpes, and friendly service."}
{"text":"We ordered the smoked salmon, shrimp and fruit explosion crêpe. Best part- they will customize any crêpe to make it gluten free! Very accommodating and friendly staff. I had the fruit explosion and switched it with nutella instead of the creme custard (to make it gluten free) and it was delicious! Choice of fruit was exquisite and very well put together! Both savory crêpes were also great and flavourful! They make their crêpes and then fill them in, therefore maintaining the crispiness in the crêpe. Would recommend, can't wait to try other crêpes on their menu!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a crepe restaurant this morning and found out this franchise has opened in Markham. My husband ordered a sweet crepe and I ordered a savoury shrimp and avocado crepe in addition to a cappuccino. My crepe took a while to be assembled and the coffee cane AFTER the crepe. The crepe was fresh and vegetable crisp. I liked it but would probably ask for a lighter  hand on the sauce.  That could just be my preference. The coffee was fine but can't tell why it took so long. The only thing I can think of for the overall delay is that they open at 11 am and we were there at 10:45 am. But the Open sign was on so they should be ready."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

After seeing fellow Yelper Wei C.'s review and Arlene B's photo, I knew I had to give T-Swirl Crepe a try (since I am a crepe lover ^^). This creperie is located in Langham Place, Markham. I saw some Instagramers saying that the waiting time was quite long, but for my experience, it was definitely less than 20 minutes. I waited around 10 minutes (given that there were two customers before me, four crepes in total). This is a fairly new creperie, I assume they needed time to train their staff and to make their crepes to perfection. The wait time is reasonable to me. 

When I walked into T-Swirl, I was immediately greeted by the cashier. She gave a menu to me so we could pick and choose our own crepe. Even though it was not the hottest day of the summer, it was still around 28 degrees. T-Swirl definitely had some ventilation issues and it was very hot there. I was sweating like crazy and I seriously couldn't stay inside to eat my crepe. 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 2 sweet crepes:

1. Wild Berries Sweet Crepe #6
- This wild berries sweet crepe was made with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, custard cream and whipped yogurt. Their fruits were very fresh! And surprisingly, they used 100% rice flour to make the crepe so it was naturally gluten free! The crepe itself was very chewy and crunchy!  Their custard cream was very sweet, glad that they used yogurt to balance the flavor. The raspberries definitely added some tangy flavors to the crepe. I love how they added some chocolate pearls and granola on the crepe, so there was some crunchy texture when you bite into it!

2. Matcha Chocolate Truffles #5
-This crepe has less ingredients compared to the wild berries crepe, but it didn't make it any less delicious! Strawberries and chocolate truffles just simply went well together! Their matcha custard cream flavor wasn't very strong, I guess because the chocolate sauce and the whipped yogurt had a strong flavor as well. The crushed pistachio looked like edible gold on the chocolate truffle! Seriously, this was a piece of art! It was way too pretty to eat! When the store associate sprinkled the pistachio over the crepe, it looked like the fairy godmother using her magic wand. It was just so fun to watch. 

-- Overall --

I would give this place a 3.5/5 for food; 1 extra point for their service, less 1 point for their poor ventilation system. (i.e. Round up to 4 stars). I may go back to try their savory crepe! :)"}
{"text":"I got a wild berry crepe. They use yogurt whipped cream which is less sweet and less fluffy than usual whipped cream. Additional ice cream is 2.5$ per scoop and it isn't that special. Probably owning a business on Yonge street is difficult cause all the cost and tax stuffs, but the crepe is still way too pricy in my opinion. There are many fantastic Japanese style crepe places in Downtown and this is probably not one of them. Crepe: below average; price: above average. Will I come back? Definitely not."}
{"text":"We try the fruit cocktail , I like it. Not over sweet and good potions of fruit, the only cons is the crepe is  not fresh make , hope next time I'll get a fresh make kne"}
{"text":"Had: Matcha Azuki Bean 

A lot of my friends tell me I'm not picky with dinner/lunch places.  However, I'm a super critic when it comes to desserts.  Why?  Because Markham does not offer much..sad.  Now I love crepes, my mouth will go into mode \"Niagara Falls\" when I see the Japanese-styled crepes.  After hearing about this place, I decided to go.  Warning you right now, parking is limited here unless you want to park underground...but that means more walking in the winter lols.

The service is okay.  I love how the crepes go into the swirly frames, just so so cute.  Now when it comes to the taste, let me just say I won't be returning.  For those who love crepes, you must know that it must be served hot.  I'm not saying the crepes aren't hot, in fact they are burnt lol.  The batter that was used must have been their in-house recipe because it sucked lol.  No taste, no flavour, the crepe was crunchy and not fluffy at all.  I will give it to them for having great matcha ice cream, but that's only for the top part of their crepe.  Where did all the flavour go for the bottom half?  I'm sorry, but when crepes are costing $9+ I expect something that speaks quality...not \"looks\".  

Until they make this crepe delicious, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The location is very hidden at the back side of the Langham Plaza. The space is also quite small with limited seating but the good thing is, there isn't a line up. I was very excited to see that they have so many selections for both sweet and savoury options. 

I ended up trying the strawberry banana crepe that comes with custard cream, whipped yogurt, chocolate pearls and crushed pistachio. I love the crepe, a little bit toasty yet thin and fresh. The fillings complement each other well and the custard cream tied everything together nicely.

Service was quite slow even with few customers inside the shop. I'd come back again to try other flavours, the only thing that concerns me is the price. It is fairly pricey for a crepe ($10+) to be honest."}
{"text":"At ~$10/crepe including tax, I found this to be an average eating experience. We ordered the (1) banana and chocolate, and (2) banana and strawberry, and while they both tasted fine, they weren't anything to write home about. 

I think the strangest thing was that although we were the only ones there and thus got our food immediately after it was prepared, eating it at its freshest point, the crepe was barely warm. To me, part of the appeal of a dessert crepe is the way it warms up and melts any sauces inside. 

It's more than I would want to spend for a crepe of this quality. There isn't a burst of flavour and if you're looking for something really tasty to top off the night, you might be underwhelmed. Again, while the taste is okay, I just don't think it was good enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"The creme brulee crepe was so good! We also tried the chocolate creme brulee which wasn't as good, so I 10/10 recommend the original. Price was good too. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went there to try out the crepe.  I think my crepe is a bit overdone cause I saw owner was teaching the new staff how to make our crepe.  So I guess bad luck.  The crepe was a bit too dry.  The toppings were not enough.  I was hoping they don't skim on the toppings, I saw they only put like 1 small spoon of red beans on mine and skim on other toppings too, too little in my opinion since it like a $12 crepe.  Probably will not return since there are better places."}
{"text":"Went in on their soft opening day. Owner was very friendly and introduced all about their store. Ordered a sweet crepe Matcha Azuki Bean with sliced strawberries, red beans paste, matcha paste, whipped yogurt, matcha #gelato, almonds and chocolate Pocky Sticks! 
Really like the strong matcha flavour from both the custard cream and gelato incorporated well with azuki, creating this authentic and classic Japanese dessert combination.
All of the crepe base are #glutenfree and they choose gelato over ice cream for sweet toppings.
Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Somewhat confused during the last visit. I came half a year ago and picked up some nice savory crepes. Last week, the menu they offered only had sweet crepes and drinks. Do they only offer savory crepes at certain hours of the day?

While I did drop by with the intention of getting a sweet crepe, I was looking at the menu and was surprised I couldn't find the savory set. Maybe it was a different menu, but they certainly took the initiative to offer us the sweet menu

Ordered the chocolate nut party, because I do like my chocolate.
It definitely did come as advertised, with two sticks of pocky, a scoop of chocolate ice cream, cubes of chocolate, chocolate sauce....lots of chocolate. It was enjoyable, but I would have preferred a nice warm crepe to go with the cold ice cream. Don't know if that's just how they do their sweet crepes or whether that's just how crepes are meant to be served."}
{"text":"The crepe itself is extraordinary. It's crunchy and thicker (in a good way) than most of the others. I always have the sweet ones but with this crepe, it goes well with anything!!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant hidden in the corner of a plaza/ shopping centre, it was a little difficult to find at first. There were so many different flavour combinations to choose from, you can also make your own exactly how you want it. 

I really liked how they had a display on their storefront of all their crepes, you get a good visual of what you're ordering. It was fun to eat I really liked the concept, it could have had a bit more flavourful but it was still very delicious. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've tried Muncheez before so I gotta say this place wasn't very impressive. 

I ordered the shrimp and avocado crêpe and my boyfriend ordered the angus short rib crêpe. Both were just mediocre and lacking meat. What we both found to be the downfall of the crêpes was that they were served to us cold. Most of the vegetables were raw (spinach, bell peppers, carrots, green beans, etc.) and we would've much preferred them to be cooked. The only thing that was slightly lukewarm was the meat, so it had a really weird overall temperature. 
For the quantity and value of the food, it was definitely not worth its price. It was like an expensive burrito, but cold and not as filling. Not worth the hype.

On the bright side though, service was fine and they have complimentary self-serve lemon water, which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as it was advertised as \"Japanese Crepes.\" I think this place can only be called \"Japanese-style crepes\" as I felt like something was off...

The chocolate ice cream was extremely low quality and tasted awful. It ruined the whole crepe. The crepe was also way too sweet. By the end of it, it made you feel like throwing up. The Creme brûlée crepe was not bad, possibly because it was smaller and less sweet."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that I got to try the crepes from T-Swirl Crepe finally!  Because of my experience on this visit, I am currently led to believe that their sweet crepes may be a better choice than their savory crepes.  However, who knows.  If I return again, I will try their other crepe selections.  

One thing I do want to note is that the crepes are fairly expensive -- around $9-14 after taxes for one.  Thus, that's one reason why I can't see myself running back any time soon to try more.  It was satisfying to eat (so fun to watch it being made too) but it was not a filling meal."}
{"text":"T-swirl is the newest Japanese crepe cafe in town and thus competes with the well-known Millie's Creperie.  Unlike Millie's, it enchants passerbys with a large scale display of plastic food models that showcases all their savoury and sweet crepes. There are many varieties that you won't find at Millie's, such as blueberry cheesecake, lychee and Angus beef, thus making it a hot choice compared to its competitor.  However, the caveat is that what you see is not what you get.

Please take a look at my pictures of the display models and other Yelpers' pictures of the menu.  What really entices the buyer is the chance to receive a large aesthetically appealing crepe, a bouquet of many fillings and flavours.  Usually, it's assumed by the buyer that if they order a Lychee Romance crepe, they should receive a crepe that looks like the display model or picture. Nope, there was barely any iced dessert in its folds and the crepe was flat with how few contents were inside when I received mine.  The same happened with my friend's Lychee Romance crepe and my BF's Chocolate Matcha Truffle crepe. Any trace of ice cream or yogurt was barely recognizable. You may want to choose some additional toppings for a more appetizing experience, but it will be on the pricier side.

I will stick with Millie's Creperie as it fattens up their crepes.  T-swirl's crepe is also firm and chewy, whereas Millie's has soft thin crepes, which is my preference.  

I will update my review at a later date.  I may have gone when the quality was below their norm. I heard their savoury crepes are great, so we shall see!"}
{"text":"Came tonight to originally try the sweet crepes but we ended up ordering a savoury one too, so 3 crepes in total.

There is a large variety of sweet and savoury crepes to choose from, 11 of each.  We browsed over the menu and ended up ordering the Wild Berries, Blueberry NY Cheesecake and the Okinawa Hot Dog.  I wouldn't really get the Wild Berry one again.  It was just lacking in filling.  The Blueberry NY Cheesecake one had a scoop of gelato in it and definitely filled it out.  The savoury one was surprisingly good, with lots of flavours bursting in every bite.   The toppings were really fresh and it was beautifully presented.

All in all, it's a nice place to grab a bite to eat but having said that, it is a bit pricy.  It cost nearly $34 for the 3 crepes.  The guy that  served us was extremely pleasant and chatty.  I asked if he was the owner and he said, yes.  I could just tell he wasn't a standard worker.  A nice place to go for an occasional treat but a bit too expensive to come reguarly.  Order a sweet crepe that comes with gelato otherwise the crepe is a bit empty."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for this so tried it out. Got the banana chocolate crepe and BLT crepe. Both were pretty good, flavourful and filling. However, the crepes themselves were disappointing since they were cold. Since I had Muncheez a few weeks ago, this was hard to compare. Would taste much better if crepes were hot and crispy."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!! I saw this place on blogTO and decided to give it a try while I was in the area. 

Was there on a Saturday and the line was a bit long. Tried the fruit cocktail with my gf, and it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Loved the angus short ribs. Smoked salmon could use a bit more smoked salmon and maybe a sauce.. but it's so refreshing I can have it for breakfast, but def not dinner if you're looking to make #gainz."}
{"text":"Cozy place to go and enjoy crepes. Really liked seeing how they made the crepes and the presentation was flawless."}
{"text":"So happy something of this quality finally shows up around this area for crepes !!! Tried their angus short rib savoury crepe and yum!! Well balanced texture and flavours with the combination of sauce, meats and veggies - great from beginning to end and as another reviewer commented the crepe was thin and nicely done wrapped several time around with abundant filling. At any given point there was a good balance of filling to wrap ratio .. No eating just a bunch of crepe at the end. They still have their grand opening special so got it at 20% off ... Otherwise it is a bit steep in price and only reason why it's not 5 stars :p"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this lovely, crepe cafe for a while. What blew me away about their menu was the sheer variety of flavours they had.

My friend and I had the shrimp avocado and Okinawa (sp?) sausage crepe. The crepes were beautifully wrapped. Taste wise, they were good, but it wasn't anything outstanding. The portions (although they look huge) aren't super filling as well, so I would not recommend having a crepe and expecting it to fill you up like a meal would. Also be careful while eating the crepe! It's served on a stand and when you're getting to the bottom it may be a little difficult to keep the whole crepe together.

All in all- not bad!"}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelper Wei C. for the tip that T-Swirl is now open in Canada. I first tried this (mainly takeout) franchise creperie in Flushing, NY last March and it left a lasting impression. First I appreciate that they have gluten free crepes made of rice flour. More importantly the crepes are really yummy!

They have a number of fresh fruit, chocolate, savoury, and Asian inspired flavours of crepes. A few sweet crepes even come with a scoop of gelato on top! We ordered the matcha chocolate truffle crepe. I love the contrast of textures between the creamy truffles and matcha cream, crunchy nuts and crepe edges, tart and sweet strawberries, and soft and slightly chewy crepe. They make their own truffles in house. I have yet to try their savoury options but the portion looks ideal for a light lunch. Crepes range from $8-$13, with their most expensive crepe being the angus short ribs crepe.

There is limited seating near the counter, as well as a few tables for two towards the back of the restaurant. A large glass dispenser filled with lemon water is readily accessible for patrons to help themselves to water to wash down the crepes. 

From July 28 to August 4 they are offering 20% off as part of their grand opening special. T-Swirl is located in a corner of the plaza beside Game station and a few doors down from Wonton Chai. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the warm welcome and our delicious sweet and savoury crepes.  
Short rib crepe was delicious and loaded with ingredients - perfection if there was a little less sauce.
BLT was our favourite.  Freshly made and the crepe is crispy, not super doughy.
Thai chicken - we loved the sauce which complemented the fillings perfectly.
Found portion size to be quite good.  Crepes were freshly prepared although we would add one star if crepe was hot as well.
Overall, clean environment, great service and fresh food.  Would visit again.
Quite a few takeout orders as we waited.  Takeout was packaged nicely and conveniently for customers.
Stamp card provided as well."}
{"text":"I had the egg white mushroom truffle for lunch. It filled me right up and was delicious. It is super easy to hold the crepe in my hands and walk around. I had about 15 minutes to finish my lunch and this was perfect as I spent a few minutes waiting for the crepe then just walked away with food in my hands. 
I did not get a chance to try the sweet crepes but will definitely try them when I'm in the area again. The boss there was very nice to me too, say hi to him, you just might make a new friend."}
{"text":"I know people are hyping about this place...
But just my opinion, after trying it for one time... Sucks!!!

I give in for the fact that it is a creative way of serving crepes, and hence the hype...

But to be honest, The crepe dough is breaking into pieces as you hold it in ur hand... It is like it is hard work to eat that crepe!!
Flavor: I took the chocolate nut Party... Flavor of chocolate is ok, but then they add some whipping cream, which is very sour, really destroys the taste, in a very bad way, real bad!!!
Chocolate ice cream tastes really bad as well!!!

I like the concept of the place, but the taste is really terrible, obviously will not come back"}
{"text":"First off it's a little difficult to find! But it's in the north east corner beside game station. On upon entering this establishment the staff is very friendly welcoming guest and asking if it was their first time visiting. We ended up ordering the Angus rib crepe and the green tea red bean crepe. The Angus rib was de-lic-ious!!!! There were many different flavours that complimented each other. I really enjoyed the crispy shallots! The green tea red bean, although I don't like red bean too much it was really good. Not overpoweringly sweet, the strawberries were super fresh and delightful!"}
{"text":"While I'm no crêpe expert I found myself disappointed with T-Swirl Crêpes. A combination of cold crêpes and high prices leave a lot more to be desired. 

We came on a Saturday night and the place was fairly packed and there were only two people working there. You could say that the place was understaffed and that the people working there were inexperienced? It took around 20 minutes for our crêpes to be made which wasn't a big deal but some people before us didn't think so.

The crêpes showed a lot of promise but failed to deliver. We went with one sweet and one savory crêpes to try. The angus short had many components going on such as a great mix of fresh veggies with tasty tofu sauce and aioli. I really liked the flavour overall but what really disappointed me were the crêpes themselves. They were cold, and apart from the top of it, was fairly soggy. After you finish the top half of the crêpe, the latter half is just a disappointment. While I didn't enjoy the texture of the crêpes, the taste of them was good. The matcha azuka bean was more or less the same. Their matcha gelato was great; good depth of matcha and not overly sweet but I wish there was more strawberries and other fillings in there, as there wasn't a whole lot going with it."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I heard T-Swirl opened up in Markham. Never had a chance to go until 2 weeks ago when I went with a friend on my day off.  Ordered the Okinawa Hot Dog and I was super disappointed.  To my surprise, the crepe itself was quite cold, the meat inside was warm, so it kinda tasted funny, reminds me of the feeling when you don't microwave something enough where the outside is hot but inside is cold; definitely not a good experience.

The Okinawa Hot Dog had a hot dog in the middle and that's it and everything was surrounded by vegetables.  To make it worst, the hot dog was small, so half way through the crepe you are just eating a salad crepe. In addition, the crepe was very saucy to the point I felt it was overshadowing everything else in the crepe. The website indicates the Okinawa Hot Dog has Sliced Chicken Breast, Shrimp, Bacon, Okinawa Hot Dog and Salmon in the crepe.  I could only taste some Bacon and the Okinawa Hot Dog, nothing else. Paying close to $10 for this crepe is totally not worth it. I probably won't come back again but when I do, I will try the sweet crepe instead.

2/5 star, not worth it at all. I rather drive a little more to go to Muncheez and have a well-made crepe for a similar price."}
{"text":"A very small crepe corner with 2 small tables, the menu looked standard so I was very curious in finding out about the taste.  I tried their strawberry banana matcha custard crepe, a bit disappointed. The crepe was a bit too \"pan-fried\", maybe they should use a different cooking spray.  Onto the crepe filling: strawberries were normal, fresh sliced banana, 2 swirls of cream custard, but where's the matcha??after eating almost 1/2 of the crepe, still no signs of matcha, thought I ordered the wrong crepe, but shortly after, I noticed there was matcha \"powder\" melted into the custard cream that I could barely see!! Note: not all their crepes have ice cream . service was great! I can't disagree with some of the existing reviews here, this place was friendly, had fresh fruits and I loved how they used yogurt instead of whipped cream so that's for sure something I liked about this place. I'm guessing this place makes better savoury crepes than sweet ones, I have to admit their savoury crepes menu looks amazing! Definite on my list for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing... they have great looks and sets and decos, but tbh the food itself is pretty shit. The crepe is too thick. Cream / ice cream spread unevenly. Much worse than millie... its menu is basically a rip-ofd from millie... :/"}
{"text":"I heard that T-swirl recently opened up in Markham, and being a crepe fanatic, of course I had to try it out. There were many options available (both sweet & savory), but I ended up with the matcha chocolate truffles crepe. 

First off, I have to compliment on the crepe batter. It was slightly crispy, yet suitably chewy at the same time. And b/c it's thin, they were able to fold it many times over, forming these alternate layers of crepe & filling. I enjoyed the resulting contrast in textures. 

As for the fillings, the creamy truffles paired well w/ the matcha custard cream, chocolate sauce, and crushed pistachios; but the strawberries were a bit too tart. And the matcha aspect was overshadowed by the chocolate sauce. Still pretty good though, albeit a tad pricey. 

Currently, they are offering 20% off until Aug 4th as part of their grand opening special. I'll be back to try the savory options, as well as the ones w/ gelato."}
{"text":"I like tswirl fruits cocktail and mango raspberry and matcha chocolate truffles and Angus short ribs?vegetarian lover, BLT, that's so delicious the staffs is very passion(forgive my English)"}
{"text":"Came here for their 2nd year anniversary promotion where all their crepes were only $3. 

The store itself is somewhat small with a front seating area and a dimly lit back seating area. 

I ordered the Matcha Azuki Bean crepe. I didn't think there were many red beans in it and the strawberries in it weren't sweet. The matcha ice cream was also nothing special. The crepe itself, however, was delicious and crunchy. Or at least that is how it started off. After a while the crepe turns soggy and is messy and hard to eat. I thought that was because mine had ice cream but the same thing happened with the Shrimp Avocado and the Angus Short Ribs crepe. 

These would not travel well at all. Once it starts to get soggy it is super messy. My friend's crepe basically collapsed in the end. Gotta eat fast if you want to eat these crepes. 

I tried a bite of the Angus Short Ribs crepe and definitely recommend it! So much better than the Matcha Azuki Bean crepe! I'm all for sweet over savory but trust me when I say that you would not regret getting the Angus Short Ribs crepe"}
{"text":"I am really surprised to see this place highly rated.
The most important thing in a crepe is that its hot and fresh, everything, I mean everything else is secondary. Their crepes failed on the most basic requirement!

When we got the crepes, they were actually cold, even though we didn't get any ice creams inside. And I could tell they used old crepes because the chocolate didn't melt, even the nutella was cold.
We were 4 people, got three crepes and none of us were able to finish, sadly went to the garbage.

I do think they made the crepes fresh, but the time the crepes take to get from kitchen to customer's hand, they have lost all the freshness and their temperature."}
{"text":"Came here one evening and it's a cute little shop in the T&T plaza. Friend and I ordered the banana chocolate crepe and BLT crepe. The prices here are pretty expensive imo, but I found it fairly filling. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the BLT crepe was (highly recommend)! It was nicely packed with filling and was super filling whereas the sweet crepe felt a little bare. 

The ambiance is great for just catching up with friends and fairly quiet. It wasn't busy at the time I went but seating is fairly limited. I think this is one of those places where you try once and don't come back because its too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Had the savory crepes, one angus beef one smoked salmon, the smoked salmon is way too healthy for me, filled with spinach, seems more like a spinach crepe, very dry, it doesn't have one bit of sauce. The angus beef crepe is okay, they have enough sauce but you won't want too much because the beef is a little too salty."}
{"text":"Good concept but poor execution. I would expect a crepe to be crispy on the outside besides the fact that it was dessert crepe.

I ordered the green tea icecream and azuka red bean crepe. Though it was tasty it was only good for the first couple of bites.

Crepes took a long time to produce. It seemed like staff members we're still trying to figure out the recipes for the crepes. The ordering system was poor as there were many customers in front but no way to know who ordered what unless you knew they were before you.

It is actually quite pricey for a crepe. I thought coming here would be a good alternative to the other dessert places in Markham but I would definitely not come back again."}
{"text":"Very good crepe .I ordered the smoke salmon and iced coffee
. I felt very satisfied after eating it tipped them 2 bucks in the tip box"}
{"text":"The chocolate nut crepe was worth the price given the amount of toppings. However, the fruit based crepes tend to provide too little fruits and mainly just eating the crepe shell. Tasted good just not worth the pricey tag at $11"}
{"text":"Stopped into T-Swirl as it was right across from the hotel I was staying at.  They have been open a week and this is their Soft Opening, so 20% off. Good Deal !  

I decided to stick with a winner for me which is a Banana Chocolate Crepe.  There were a pile of people behind the counter, but there was a very friendly gal that took my order.  She told me it would be a few minutes wait.  I understood the reason for all the people behind the counter, and that was because it was worker training going on.  
There is a very small area to eat your crepes ( a counter with 3 chair, and bench, for maybe another 3-4 people.  There is a space along the side the construction area (that's what I'm calling it) as you can watch your crepe being made.  Which I thought was very fun to watch.  

I got my crepe and luckily there was a space for me to sit and eat it.  

The crepe was very good and albeit a bit messy, I thought that it was just the right amount of sweetness and flavour.  While I finished my crepe there were plenty of people coming in to take a look.  

Overall, Service was very good and the crepe was delish.  The delivery speed of the crepe wasn't stellar, but I'm thinking that with the training going on, that they'll improve with time.  The worst part of this is that it's directly across the street from the hotel I typically stay at.  I have visions of me trying more of their crepes..."}
{"text":"Since they had a 20% off promo, we decided to try it out. It was their grand opening and the store was very busy.

I've never had a \"crêpe cone\" before, so why not? Their window display models were eye catching! (See pic).

The space was newly constructed and furnished, but small. They have seating for around 8 people.

Service was very slow. We waited over 20minutes for one crepe.

We ordered the Matcha Azuki bean crepe (reg $9.98). It was made fresh and assembled in front of us. It had a few pieces strawberry, cream/yogurt, a pinch of red bean/almonds, and the Matcha ice cream in the centre. It tasted good, but could've used more toppings and fruit though.

It is expensive compared to other crêperies that sell Japanese crepe cones in Toronto (around $7).

The concept and design was cute. They even have a small triangle bag for crepes to go.

I'm a sweets person, so I liked it. This place reminded me of the Wanda's waffles that was closed down on Yonge due to condos. 

I might be back. Probably not."}
{"text":"Such rude staff! Came there around 10 on Saturday night to have dessert there. The cashier was a bit better than the other staff and at least answered our question, with no facial expressions though, when we were ordering. The other ones were very slow, took them a long time to prepare our order. They didn't seem to care about people sitting and waiting there than those who ordered take-outs. When we were done, I said thanks and good night, but not a single one from the four of them present there answered back or even smiled! I repeated again, no one answered! My companions said bye, but not a single reaction from the staff either! Even though the crepe was fairly good (hard to manage though as it was fully filled), I won't come back!"}
{"text":"Fast Read:
1) Crepe are thin and crispy.  I can taste the roasted crepe.
2) Ingredient are flavorful, and filling.  Angus ribs are good.
3) Too much cold filling ingredient, making the crepes cold and soggy very quickly.

My first visit.
We order the 2 crepes, Angus Ribs; and the Egg white Mushroom with Truffles.
Very friendly staff.  I like the lemon water available.

When we got our crepes, we picked at the filling, and they taste very good, especially the angus ribs.  I Ripped a piece of crepes off alone and it is very crisp, with the roasted pastry taste.  Best taste outside of France!

After the first few bites, the crepes and the crispiness wear out very quickly, and it turn into any old crepes, with lots of ingredient, like a big American sandwich.  The spinach and veggies were not dried well, as there's still a lot of water dripping out as I am eating.

The paper wrapping doesn't rip (following the cut line) very well, and it make for a messy eat.

$13 for a crepes is also on the expensive side.  There is a buy 10 get one free stamp card available."}
{"text":"It seems like every single time I walk down Yonge St I stumble across some new restaurant or place to grab treats and it's my absolute favourite thing in the world. While walking on Saturday afternoon I stumbled across T-Swirl Crêpe and it lit my face up like a fat guy walking by a crêpe place (which is the exact thing that happened, weird). Upon entering I was excited to see a menu like this. It's basically like eating fun ice cream sundaes out of a crêpe, and who wouldn't enjoy that? I settled on one that had vanilla ice cream, chocolate fudge, whip cream, and brownie pieces on top of it and it was absolutely delicious. The actual crêpe itself was soft and warm and the other ingredients were yummy as well. I highly reccommend this place to anyone who is alive, breathing, or possibly even not breathing? It doesn't matter, do yourself a favour and swing by this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! Taste just like the one in San Francisco. I like the crunchy edges that this crepe has.  It's a really great chain.  Strange location but at the corner of a plaza but has parking underground.  Take the elevator up and try this crepe.  Best crepe in the greater Toronto(Markham).  Wish it was in Toronto area.  The Muncheez in North York cannot compare.  This crepe is much bigger and better tasting.   These crepes has so much ingredients.  The ones in Muncheez was so small comparatively.  This is way better."}
{"text":"I ordered the 'Lychee Romance/Romantic(?)' with Lychees, Raspberries, Rose Custard Cream, Whipped Yogurt, Crushed Pistachio. The name and menu picture sounded/looked much better than the real thing. Couldn't really taste the yogurt or pistachio. The crepe was quite dry for the first half but was slightly better once I reached the middle with more raspberry/jam type filling. 

I think the icecream crepes would be slightly better."}
{"text":"The crepes are packed full of ingredients which make it a bit hard to eat because it simply doesn't fit into your mouth. The wait is about 7-10 mins for a crepe depending on what you order. The seating situation are French cafe style table and chairs which also mean they're small, they slide, and they're wobbly - the table is also very low making it very uncomfortable to sit and eat at, the better choice are the high chairs along the window. The pieces are amongst the mid range level which seems to be reasonable considering they pack the crepe with so much food, just not sure the whole packed crepe is worth it because it's hard to eat. A lot of the ingredients end up falling out as you try to eat it. I think it could be better."}
{"text":"Went to their soft opening with 20%off but their crepe is hard and and not as tasty as it should be. It was disappointing and I expected it to be more flavourful. It felt just like an European stye pancake with some ice cream added to it with chocolate sauce. It was not really bad, more bland I would say."}
{"text":"I have tried few different places for crepes in Toronto, so far this is best one in Markham area. Love the matcha Azuki crepe :) not too overpowering and not to crazily sweet. Would def recommend it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving something sweet and we didn't really feel like going to sit down dessert spot so of course I went to my favourite place YELP to look for a dessert place on the go! 

When we arrived it wasn't busy at all. The cashier was helpful helping my indecisiveness boyfriend decide what he wanted. We ended getting the banana chocolate crepe and it was amazing, you could actually tell the crepe batter was fresh. We also got the mango green tea and that was good as well!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the looks of the crepes! I've had various crepes before and honestly, this is not comparable to ones I've had in Japan,HK and even the crepes at Canadian malls. It also kills me to see how slow/ inefficient people are working there and that they are still referring to the menu for what needs to go on the crepe. I was also unimpressed with how long i had to wait given it wasn't even busy. I had the matcha azure crepe and I am not sure why the custard or cream was more salty than sweet. When eating it, there wasn't enough filling to crepe ratio. At the end of the crepe, I was left with a folded layer of just crepe. For what I am paying and the waiting time, I might just opt for a cheaper crepe at FMP...."}
{"text":"Like the good. Tidy and neat place. The one on Enterprise in Markham from before was friendlier. The crew here is very loud."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Limited seating.  Clean and quiet.  Friendly service.  Great  crepes, from  fruits to ice cream to chocolate to nutella to  Angus beef.  You won't be full with one crepe.  Free drink with purchase of two crepes.  Service a bit slow. I was expecting a hot and fragrant crepe,  but that didn't happen since they took their time to fill crepe."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I'm not ashamed of admitting it because it's *that good*. I've got to say that these are the best crepes I ever had. 

The crepe itself is very soft and the edges are crispy. Between the layers of the crepe is filled with sauce and ingredients because they pack the crepe. 

I've tried their savoury crepe once - it was good but I still enjoy their sweet crepes more. 

This place is more of a grab and go as they have limited seating. But seating hasn't been an issue for the times I've visited since they were not busy. 

Amazing crepes!"}
{"text":"Tried the chocolate nut crepe, it was a amazing! The flavour of the chocolate was good, but the whip cream was literally the icing on the cake. So good! 

The way they serve the crepe in a cone is pretty unique and makes it easier to eat while on the go!

They have a 20% discount right now for grand opening but I'd say the prices are still pretty fair even without the discount.

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really excited about this place! I loved the window display of all of their crepes and the one I ordered even looked like the display! You can add on stuff if you can't find a combination on their normal menu to make it into the perfect snack! The crepe itself was a bit crispy which was fantastic for holding its cone shape while you chowed down! Loved the vibes, although I felt they seemed a little frazzled behind the counter at the beginning. Can't wait to go back, love it!"}
{"text":"Whoo hoo!  First to review!  T-Swirl is an American franchise that makes sweet and savoury Japanese style crepes and this is the first Canadian franchise that has opened up here in Markham.

Japanese Crepes are different from traditional crepes as rice flour is used instead of regular flour so this is a gluten free alternative for those who are interested.  Rice flour based crepes are much more crispy then flour based crepes so the crepes actually stay crispy longer.

These guys just opened today so my friend grabbed a #11 T-Swirl Fruit Cocktail Crepe.  It was excellent!  They definitely didn't skimp on the fillings as it was filled to the rim and for an average appetite big enough to share, but I'm pretty sure many of you will be a little greedy and eat the whole thing by yourself:)

Most people will probably compare this to Muncheez but I haven't gone there yet, so can't compare the two.  But being Japanese style crepes you really shouldn't compare the two anyways.

They just opened and have 20% Grand Opening on all crepes till Augusts 4th, so take advantage of this special.  The service was a little slow but that is completely understandable as they just opened and hopefully they will become more efficient.  Look forward to trying many more crepes to come!

UPDATE:  Just went back today and tried a savoury crepe and went for the Angus Short Rib...  OMG!!!! It was outstanding!  The flavour combination was awesome with the Angust Short Rib, Veggies, Chipotle Mayo etc.. was fantastic!  I'm still drooling about it since I had it!"}
{"text":"Newly opened crepes joint in Markham.. Located in the corner of the upper level parking lot in Langham Square - if you know where that is..

Not sure what a Japanese crepe is... So I don't have anything to compare it too.. My brother says these crepes are kinda small compAred to the ones he had in Japan.. I felt the serving size was just right..  

Personally, I only eat the savoury crepes and usually have the ham&cheese or breakfast types ones anywhere I go.. My favourite place would be the one inside the temblant village.

Ordered the BLT for breakfast. The owner, James, took my order and he was very enthusiastic. All the staff were very welcoming as well. Grand opening special, all crepes are 20% off, my BLT crepe came to a total of $10.55, took about 5 minutes to make.

The overall crepe was good. The bacon was crispy and the highlight for the crepe in my opinion. The cherry tomatoes, lettuce, and sauce were good.. The crepe itself was thin and a little crispy, reminded me of Chinese style waffles.

Good size crepe for breakfast, didn't automatically provide any napkins with the take-out orders tho.. The take-out bag is cute, but I think, just get it without the take-out bag..

Also went back to try their Angus Short Ribs crepe. $11.70 after tax with their grand opening discount. Crepe was constructed nicely, had pulled beef strips and beef sauce from top to bottom. 

All of the crepes look picture perfect!"}
{"text":"Skip it.

I have had way better crepes almost anywhere. Where this new business holds the upper hand is with their variety and exotic flavours. It is probably one of those businesses (a chain) that is designed to capture the Instagram/social media crows and not the taste/quality enthusiasts.
They almost have no flavour to these things. It feels like you are eating a special diet crepe, which is odd because the crepes are not small and get soggy very soon because you can't eat them fast enough.

The crepes will set you back $12 or so each and for that price I expect quality items that are delicious. Instead, my smoked salmon crepe was hard, crunchy fragile and the ingredients are actually not mixed so one moment you can bite into pure dough, another you can bite into cream and another only fish. Also, how can a crepe and fish have so little flavour?

Again, they have a few unheard of kinds of crepe like fish, steak and some kind of hotdog so they are trying something different, but this just proves that some flavours were just not meant to be. They also have the more traditional crepes like blueberry, ice cream too, but I hesitate to recommend them due to the fragile nature of the crepes and the taste...

The parlour style outlet has very few tables, but since they were empty and had no customers seating is not a problem because the crepes are so large there is no taking them out."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious and I can't stop thinking about their cream/sauce for the Strawberry Banana sweet crepe! I really recommend it. The amazingly special cream, crunchy chocolate balls and pistachio bits, paired with fresh strawberries and bananas on a milky eggy crepe was near 10/10.
The only downside was that the crepe was cold, and it seemed like they were pre-made? Nevertheless, their stuffings makes up for it with the right amount everything in each bite. 

I also tried their hot peach green milk tea. It was good if you're in the mood for something warm and peachy.  

The total came to about $16 for both. I think is a  reasonable price for yummy desserts if you are sharing with a friend. Eating half of the strawberry banana crepe will definitely leave you wanting more!"}
{"text":"Tried this new crepe place in the evening today. The shop's narrow spacing doesn't allow for much seating. There were three small tables, a bar table for 5 and a few benches along the corridor. Great for grab-and-go. 

Both savory and sweet crepes were very well made. 5/5 for presentation. Staff here are attentive to details. Minor things like lemon slices in the water, the use of crepe stands and the way they lay out the ingredients on the crepe. 

They aren't stingy on ingredients either. They use fresh ingredients and make sure each layer of the crepe from top to bottom has ingredients. You can watch how they make it! 

Matcha Azuki Bean good qualities: It was nice that they used matcha gelato rather than the usual ice cream. I appreciated that the matcha sauce and crushed almonds were thoughtfully spread within the layers of the crepe.
Downsides: Matcha gelato was too sweet and lacked matcha flavour. As well, I could hardly notice the red bean paste.

Okinawa Hotdog and Smoked Salmon good qualities: It's a given to use fresh ingredients but they offered a generous amount of salmon. Every bite from the top to bottom of the crepe had ingredients!
Downsides: Nothing major but I wish the crepe was served warm over cold. My personal crepe preference is thin and chewy over thick and crisp. 

I'd give a few of their other crepes a try but I doubt I'll want to frequently spend $10+ for a crepe."}
{"text":"T-swirl Crepe is a decent place to grab a quick dessert. This small creperie serves generously filled crepes and prices are on par with most dessert places.

There are both sweet and savoury crepes. Personally I find the sweet crepes more appealing. They also do tea lattes here as well (no coffee unfortunately).

I got a Nutella banana crepe and it was huge! I highly recommend sharing the stuff here unless you plan on making this a meal. The crepes are of the Japanese variety - meaning that the crepe is slightly crispy instead of the soft French variety. I find the crispiness to be quite satisfying and this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Had it and was still hungry and I'm a petite Asian girl. Nothing special with the ingredients either with the exception of \"Shrimp Avocado\", the shrimp was tasty, but the quantity was so little."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a snack while exploring downtown.

Ordered the Angus Short Ribs cone. The meat was pretty good, though there could have been more of it. There was a decent mix of veggies, though there was too much iceberg lettuce. The combination of sauces felt out of place and could have been easily replaced with a simple teriyaki.

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Japanese style crepes with a wide assortment of sweet and savoury options. I've only been here for dessert (sweet) crepes and so far they've both been very good. We had the green tea and chocolate truffle crepe with strawberries. Right after ordering they start prepping the ingredients so that you can see your crepe being made fresh on the spot! Would be awesome for kids to enjoy the show. 

Seating wise there isn't a lot of room. If you're coming for lunch I assume it is going to be a grab and go scenario. They have lunch specials so make sure you take advantage of that if you work in the area. 

Overall - happy that Japanese style crepes have arrived in Toronto and hopefully more to come."}
{"text":"Like the fact that they make it fresh and takes their time in prepping the crepe. Sweet or savory. It tastes  good! It's slightly messy, but worth the mess. 
I tried the shrimp avocado and loved that they had a little wasabi sauce that gives a little kick to the bite."}
{"text":"Tried the Matcha Azuki Bean ($9.95)
Sliced strawberries, red bean, matcha custard cream, whipped yogurt, and almonds wrapped in a crepe, topped with matcha ice cream and two chocolate Pocky sticks. Sort of difficult to eat, you cant really eat the ice cream with the crepe because it won't all fit in one bite - kinda have to eat the ice cream first. The ingredients were fresh and all went well together. The crepe was thin, not too crispy though and slightly chewy.

Service is REALLY slow! Reason being they actually slice each strawberry on the spot, and they have to nicely place each ingredient in an orderly fashion. It's nice to see that the ingredients were fresh but it would be smarter if they prepared the ingredients in advance to speed things up. The wait is ok if the place isn't busy, but if it is, you'll be waiting a really long time."}
{"text":"I came with 2 other friends on a weekday afternoon right before dinner time. The first thing to mention is that this store is tucked away in a corner so even though I was specifically looking for it, it took a few minutes. The staff were super friendly as soon as we walked in and they were ready to answer any questions. However, this place is pretty small so I wouldn't suggest bringing a big crowd or your extended family. It would be best if you're looking for a grab and go. My friends and I shared 2 savoury crepes and 1 sweet crepe:

1. Okinawa Hot Dog ($10.45): included the Okinawa hot dog, mesclun mix, julienned carrots, cheddar cheese, red onions, red peppers, corn, banana ketchup, and tofu sauce. I was pretty impressed with how they included ingredients from the top to bottom of their crepe. It was pretty delicious. However, it is not good for sharing. They didn't have any plates and no knives either. Only plastic forks and spoons. It came on a stand and that was pretty cute. 

2. Smoked Salmon ($11.95): included smoked salmon, cream cheese, baby spinach, capers, red onions, and string beans. Again, they included ingredients from the top to bottom of the crepe but I was a bit disappointed with this one because the cream cheese flavour wasn't as strong as I would like it to be and I couldn't taste the string beans at all. However, there was a good amount of smoked salmon and they were flexible when I asked for no onions. 

3. Matcha Azuki Bean ($9.95): strawberries, matcha custard cream, red bean, whipped yogurt, matcha gelato, almonds and chocolate pocky sticks. Ingredients from top to bottom, but I couldn't taste the red bean and the matcha gelato definitely wasn't up to standard. Nonetheless, it was a good compliment to the savoury crepes we just had.

Overall, the crepes weren't as thin as I would've liked and some flavours just weren't there but they were a good snack because they made me feel satisfied and not bloated. Even though they didn't have any plastic knives, they brought one out from the kitchen for us so the service was there. I took a look at the drink menu and asked for dairy substitutes and they didn't have any. Not only that, their lattes are made with whole milk and their shakes with the gelato so I opted out from that. I would probably come again if someone were to mention it but not on my own."}
{"text":"I came here on account that it was on my recommended list for a snack, and that they had a 20? discount for their grand opening! 

On to the main thing! I ordered their mango raspberry sweet crepe for 8.50 after discount (roughly 9.75), and took a small wait of around 5-10 minutes. The staff were very nice and welcoming, and the crepe itself was fairly sizable, light, and tasty! A good combination of the sweet and sour from the apple mango and the raspberry combined with the chocolate made for a very satisfying mid day snack! 

All in all, a fairly satisfying experience, but I'm not sure I would come back based on its price. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I got the chocolate nut party crepe to share with my girlfriend. I really liked the taste. We wanted to share one and they offered to split the crepe in half and wrap them separately for us. Really convenient!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this Japanese Crêpe place. I have tried their T-swirl Crêpe and the Creme Brûlée crepe both are really good. The T-Swirl Crêpe is filled with Bananas, Strawberries and Blueberries with a yogurt swirl and pistachios accent. It is fairly light and a nice snack. The Creme Brûlée Crêpe is their signature Crêpe and is a Crêpe with a cream filling and slightly charred to give it the Creme Brûlée look. The Crêpes are rice based making them gluten-free and light. Add one of their milk or fruit teas and you have a great pairing for a snack or small meal. There are a variety of savory crepes but I didn't get to try it. I will be back and recommend this place. Only down fault there is only about 9 seats in the place and people take their time to eat their crepes."}
{"text":"T-Swirl Crepe is the newest creperie in Markham. 

I was fortunate to able to take advantage of their Grand Opening Special 20% off. Matcha Azuki  Bean ($9.95) was quite delicious and I love the crispiness of the rice flour crepes. But there was hardly any filling and my ice cream was so small and with just a few azuki beans. (Nothing compares to the marketing photo on their pamphlet)

I found the interior a little too dim and music too loud. (Maybe I am getting old...) When I was there, the owner was loudly chatting with his friend with quite a lot of swearing in between. I found this not a comfortable and welcoming vibe for customers.

Will I be back? Maybe? But paying $10+ for a crepes probably not something I would have do that often."}
{"text":"Very unique food which we discovered when we visited this crepe restaurant near Yonge and Bloor. They have both savory and sweet crepes alongside teas. Food is tasty but it was not filling. For the price we paid for 2 crepes, we were hoping it would be a good lunch place. It is mainly a takeout restaurant but they do have few tables and chairs. Friendly staff and street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place after seeing pictures but was underwhelmed. The crêpes are a work of art - very pretty - but taste-wise, they were less than mediocre. I went with my 2 sisters and we ordered the Okinawa Hot Dog, Chicken Teriyaki, and Angus Short Ribs. Of all 3, the Angus Short Ribs was the best tasting of the 3 but it became very soggy by the end of it. Overall opinion of the place was that it takes way too long time for what it is. My sister who ordered first waited almost 30 mins for hers. The savory crêpes were cold and we were expecting them to be warm (they take them off the heat when they add toppings). 

Will not be coming back, will look at pretty pictures instead."}
{"text":"It is their soft opening and everything is 20% off.  I ordered the Blueberry cheesecake crepe and it came around to $9.01 (that is with 20% off).  It is kind of pricey.

The presentation on the crepes are very beautiful and well-done .  The crepe was pretty good and it pairs well with the vanilla ice cream/blueberries.  The only thing I would love for them to do is just get a cream cheese ice cream instead of putting actual cream cheese.  

Customer service was very friendly and I was greeted with a smile from all the staff .  The store is cool and their crepe display out in the front put me in awe.

Overall,  I would come back to buy an occasional crepe but I would like to try their veggy/salmon crepes."}
{"text":"I got the Mango Raspberry and the Matcha Truffle crepe to go. Firstly, I loved how they packaged it, super easy to eat on the go with the paper cone that can be teared down as you eat ! The crepe itself was chewy and a medium thickness.

Matcha truffle Crepe (5/5): this was my favourite ! I absolutely LOVED the green tea matcha custard, the pocky sticks added a nice crunch, the slices of strawberries added some freshness, and there were lots of truffle chocolates placed evenly throughout the crepe so that you got one ever 2-3 bites. The Truffle chocolate was so smooth and basically melted in my mouth! The bottom was filled with whipped cream so it didn't get soggy and held up nicely.

Mango Raspberry Crepe (3/5): overall a tangy fruity sweet crepe with some custard and chocolate sauce. Nothing too stand outish and the filling seemed to be lacking so the crepe felt dry/too thick in some spots.

I'll definitely come back to try some other flavour in the future !"}
{"text":"Small unique crepe place but pricy for what you get. This new crepe place is hidden in the back outside corner of the T&T plaza so parking is limited if you want to park close to it. The interior has a unqiur theme with very limited amount of seating. Order the BLT, Angus beef, and matcha chocolate. The BLT was surprsingly good with a little kick to it with the spicy mayo. The Angus beef crepe was even better in my opinion, tender and flavourful. The matcha green chocolate was a little disappointing because ofnhow small it was and I was surprised it did not come with ice cream. 

Overall this place has decent crepe but it is pricy for what you get and not sure if it is worth checking out multiple times after you have tried it once."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, always cooked to perfection, light and fluffy. The toppings compliment each other very well. I tried the mango raspberries and fruits cocktail and they were extremely amazing. Their teas are also brewed very well."}
{"text":"Newly opened crepe place that offers both dessert style as well as savory crepes.  My friend and i went up to the counter to order our crepes.  I asked for shrimp avocado crepe with iced mango green tea and then sat down at an empty table to wait for my meal.
The interior is pleasant and simple with a tiny area for sitting down to enjoy your dinner.   Unfortunately there aren't enough staff to come around to clear the tables frequently, resulting in little fruit flies hanging out with the customers.  
The crepe is rolled into a cone shape with all the stuffings in between, and it is then placed into a cone shaped clear plastic wrap.  The presentation overall is lovely.  The portion is large but there aren't many sheimps in the crepe.  The iced mango green tea that i ordered with the crepe was over powering in its flavor which prevented me from being able to truly enjoy the taste of the crepe.
Last but not least is the social media peomotion where you get a free scoop of ice cream if you show them a yelp review of your experience there,  or you post a picture on facebook or instagram.  Nice little bonus to end your meal with."}
{"text":"This was the third stop we had on our lunch time excursion with my wife and friend.  Before eating our satisfying meal from the place next door we saw this Creperie and I said let's go here after so I had made some room.

The crepes here are not the typical thin/fancy crepes you get in most places, the crepe we got was HUGE in comparison.  We ordered a smoked salmon crepe to share with my wife and myself.  The price point considering was also the same as those thin/fancy crepe shops that do not come close to filling you up.

It had very fragrant smoked salmon scent and I was enjoying every bite.  Even the raw onions didn't detract me, the raw onion slices gave it a sweet tinge rather than being biting and provided extra crunch.

I couldn't really say much about it because my wife and I practically wolfed it down.  I think it had spinach in there as well.  The crepe itself was well made, but I wasn't paying enough attention to it for me to do a review.

Considering the wait for the crepe was a bit long. It was nice they provided free wifi.

I have to get back here to try the other crepes one of these days."}
{"text":"I must say these crêpes are just perfect! Perfect creations and alternatives with the flavours and fillings. And the calories are lower than I expected. Besides they are sweet but at a perfect level of the sweetness!"}
{"text":"Drive all the way from Mississauga to try the crepe and ended with great disappointment. Price is high and taste nothing comparable with authentic Japanese crepe (freshly made ones, with over 50 kinds of combinations, best street food in winter). Barely have any taste at all... can skip it"}
