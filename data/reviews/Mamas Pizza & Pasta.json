{"text":"This place is awesome!   Pizza is Authentic NY Style.  Cecilian Itialian at it's best.   I love the sauce!   The meatballs are huge, the lasagne melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The food is ok, we ordered an extra large pizza for pick up and were told 15 minutes to pick up.  Arrived about 20 minutes later and the young girl at the counter told me, after looking in the back, a few more minutes.  So I stood by and waited.  About 10 minutes later a woman, maybe the owner, approached me and asked me had I been helped and I replied sort of.  She asked my name and I told her.  She went to the back, looked around and asked one of the cooks something.  Then she went and looked on top of one of the ovens and there was my order.  It was ready when I walked in they just had no idea at the front.  So, 10 minutes or so wasted.  When we got home we did eat it all so not complaining about the taste just the service.  My wife wanted to try it again so the next night we ordered a calzone and a medium pizza. Gave the person my name and was told about 20 minutes to pick up.  Went to pick it up and was told by the same front staff that couldn't find my order from the previous night that they had given our order to another lady with the same name.  So, now we had to re order and wait another 20 minutes. Ughhhhh..  Ok, so we finally get our food and go home to eat it.  I had the calzone which had no taste.  Very bland and doughy. Will not order that again.  Wife seemed to like the pizza so may get that again.  The front end staff was apologetic for their mistake but at no point offered any sort of break on the price, coupon or credit for our next visit.  That was sort of a downer. If I were in charge I would have done that.  The food is decent but our only two visits have been disappointing. MAY go back..."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned this restaurant is hidden around the side of Publix so it isn't visible unless you drive in the side entrance of the shopping mall, but it is worth the search. We ordered a range of dishes (pizza, pasta, eggplant and salmon) and each was scrumptious. The sauce is homemade and delicious. The service we received was top notch. Orders were taken quickly, the food came quickly, and our waiter was very attentive. If you're looking for a genuine Italian meal, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Answer. Awful food and horrible service..I'm not sure the staff understands customer service. When I have to get out of my seat to find my server its pretty sad. We waited months to try this place and Wye disappointed."}
{"text":"Stop in at least 3 times a month. Best meatball and steak and cheese in the area, pizzas are incredible, but the Bruschetta keeps my wife and I coming back!! Prices are good for the area, but go on Wednesday for carry pizza special, $7.99 for a large  cheese!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with Mamas, we ordered food from there last night and I understand the hour wait for delivery, but when I cut the chicken open it was raw.   So I called them up to tell them, their response what kind of chicken dish was it, does it matter? It was raw. So after I spoke to several people I finally spoke to a manager or owner and he asked the same question. He said he would send new chicken over, no thank you. We already waited for an hour and had hungry kids. The owner/manager and workers were not helpful, didn't care about customer service or salmonella poisoning. We ordered some other stuff and I couldn't eat it because we were so grossed out. So they said next time your order from us the chicken is on the house. No thank you. It upsets me that mamas used to be my go to place to order pizza from. I can over look a cold pizza or garlic not (which has happened before), but definitely not raw chicken (and not even apologizing). Mamas won't be getting anymore business from me or my family."}
{"text":"Don't ask for a delivery.  Your wait time is over an hour and forty five minutes. They need to get some help. This is ridiculous. Most pizza places are around 30 to 45 minutes. This is not the first time for this kind of wait. Not gonna deal with that."}
{"text":"Being a restauranteur in Indian Land has got to be the easiest job in America. That was my takeaway from dining at Mamas Pizza & Pasta. How is this place anywhere close to a 4 star cumulative average? 

We went on a Friday night and the place was SRO so I figured we hit the jackpot. Like a fool, I ordered a sampler feast. I am here to tell you that this place serves frozen and microwaved food. The meatballs were waterlogged. The cheese on the lasagna looked like spackle. The spaghetti pasta was flavorless. And all of it is covered in a \"marinara\" sauce that tastes like it was store bought but they dumped a bunch of sugar into it to hide the taste. 

Maybe the pizza here is great... I don't know. And I'm not trying to completely pan the place as it has its merits as a CiCi's type place where you can strap on the feedbag. You want to feed a bunch of kids? This is your place. However this should not be on anyone's lips as \"authentic NY\" anything. 

I threw out most of my food by the way."}
{"text":"Good dinner. Nice atmosphere. So happy to have an authentic NY Italian restaurant in Indian Land,SC."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Mama's for quite awhile cause we were disappointed several times in the past. We wanted a quick takeout mozzarella pie after shopping for the afternoon and decided that we would give Mama's a chance again since they've been open for a couple of years now. I was hoping that they improved overtime. What a mistake..! I called and ordered the pie and was told 20 minutes to pickup but when I arrived it wasn't done...they FORGOT my order so I had to wait for another 1/2 hour before it was done. I got it home and opened the pizza box and the crust was barely done and all the cheese and sauce were in the center and not much around the edges. BTW, that was not caused by not handling the pizza box on transfer home! Needless to say I will not return back. I would rather drive further and get a much better pizza where they actually make excellent authentic Italian pizza pies."}
{"text":"Take-out process is terrible.  I have had multiple occasions when my order was not ready at the estimated time given. So be prepared to wait longer then the time they tell you. Other then that the food is awesome. I just wish they would do a better job managing take out orders as it does get frustrating at times."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice, and the food and service were both very good. Huge portions, had spaghetti with meat balls once and lasagna once, both we're very good and large quantities as well. Good value for the money, will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food and staff is phenomenal! This is how you do an Italian restaurant right. Good sized portions. Garlic knots are great before your meal. Management and waiters know what they're doing. Very attentive to their customers."}
{"text":"Been eating at Mama's since they opened, always had great food with good size portions at a reasonable price.    Don't want to be picky but last few visits the new wait staff were less than pleasant, perhaps they need a bit of advice on how to talk to customers.  I am not a guy and cringe when asked \"are you guys doing ok?\"  Also, last visit when our waitress brought my change, she only brought back the paper change, and not the 23 cents.  I know this sounds very picky, but this is what keeps some people away.....will stick to take out"}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  The past 3 times we have ordered from here, it took over an hour and a half AND they were missing part of our order.  Used to be good but service and quality have both gone downhill.  Don't waste your time or money and don't bother complaining because management could care less. Hopefully they will shut down and open space for a business that doesn't suck."}
{"text":"The pasta and pizzas eaten at their restaurant are great.  Quality foods every time.  Very good for the price.  

However, delivered pizzas have been very disappointed, several times.  We called in before 8 pm; food didn't get delivered until 9:05 pm.  It took more than an hour for the pizzas to arrive.  By that time, the crust is stale.  The juice/grease spills to one side of the box, leaving the meat dry.  Twice, this had happened.  We spent $35 (including tips) for cold pizzas and soggy calamari.  Honestly, Digiorno tastes better for $8 pizza.  Bad food is disappointing, but the frustration from bad customer service is the primary problem.  We could of had TV dinners and avoided the frustration.

The previous order should have been free for bad service.  Instead, the manager offered 20% off on our next order.  No thank you.  This is bad management.

It'd be wise for the owner/manager to rethink their delivery system.  Losing customers is a guarantee if they keep this up.  This is last straw.  We won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Pizza is the best so far in Indian Land, unfortunately that's not saying much.  Get the large pizza deal on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! The server was very nice but had no knowledge of the menu. It says everything is made from scratch on the website. The food was flavorless and everything tasted frozen. I odered a $12 chicken dish that had 3 tiny pieces of prosciutto and 8 tiny 1/2 inch cubes of chicken. I asked to see the manager..he offered to remake. When we declined he said he'd be right back. Never returned. The bill comes and I logically assumed the the horrid barely touched food would be comped. Not the case. I tipped the server (not his fault) and proceeded to track down the manager. 3 separate employees were looking for him. I finally got him in my sights in the kitchen and waved him out. He told me there was nothing he could do. He said the owner said we had to pay for it!! Unbelievable!!! Terrible customer service and terrible food."}
{"text":"We ordered a sicilian thick crust pizza and the spinach artichoke dip. We had it delivered and it did arrive in the time we were told. However, the pizza was $18.95 - $14.95 for the pizza plus 2 $2 toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms) and the dip was $6.95. There was maybe 1/2 cups worth of dip in the container! The pizza was either horribly overcooked or old and they reheated it. We called the manager and he told us that what we got delivered was right but that they would credit us. I will never eat at this restaurant again - HORRIBLE pizza and way over priced for what you get!"}
{"text":"Amazing....simply amazing. And that means a lot coming from a guy raised in Brooklyn. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be good but quality has seriously went down!  Burn crust, wrong or missing toppings, bad service. No one seems to know what to do. Mgr said because of turn-over but ... Every time i go in there are 6-10 people standing around doing nothing but talking to each other.  

Close to my house & we do take out. But tonight will be our last! $15+ for a 2 topping medium pie that is burnt. Mama's you have to do better!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with 4 items and 3 sodas $30.00.  We all took our first bites and looked at each in disbelief the pizza tasted just like the metal pan it was served on. After a few minutes we narrowed it down to the black olives that tasted metallic.

 The rest of the pizza was your sub-par New york style pizza thin soggy crust that released all cheese and toppings as soon as you pick it up. Sauce had no flavor. Pretty horrible really and disappointing since this area really needed a good pizza place. 

We told the waitress immediately and asked her to take it away because we were not going to eat it. She took it away and told us she still had to charge us half price ($15.00 plus tip) for the meal. I did not bother arguing we just wanted to go some where else and get a decent meal. 

Don't waste your time or your money hopefully the next place that moves in that space will have better food."}
{"text":"SERVICE and DELIVERY are HORRIBLE!! One time was 2 hours for a soggy pizza, the second time I tired it they deleted my order and didn't even call to tell me, HORRID!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, but the pasta is horrible. Not sure how you can screw up spaghetti but it was watery sauce (not the same sauce on the pizza), and the ravioli was store bought and still cold in center. It was horrible. The side bread was bad too. I would just buy pizza there not any entrees."}
{"text":"Man this place is amazing! First tried it when a coworker brought some to work. Fiancé and I went this past Friday and had a large pepperoni with Italian sausage. By the next day it was all gone!"}
{"text":"Raw Chicken, no response from management. Never again. Its a shame. But they will have to do better than this when Portofino's opens."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Mama's with my family since it opened.  Delicious food!  Lasagna, spaghetti & meatballs, pizza and garlic knots are our favorites!  Many other scrumptious dishes!  Eating there is best because delivery takes at least an hour but worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time at Mama's Pizza but it won't be our last. From the appetizers to the main course it was excellent! True Italian food, great family atmosphere and all around wonderful experience!  I highly recommend this place for next Italian meal!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Fed 6 people for $36; huge fresh pizza slices and tons left over. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Quality service and food every single time I've been here. Mamas has become one of our top 5 go to pizza places in the area. Coming from Maryland and growing up eating incredible pizza in and around New York I couldn't wait for a good pizza place I pop up. This definitely hits the spot. Love love love mamas!"}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout before so we they have really good food but when we tried to actually dine in the experience was totally different. We were seated, given menus, and given some really good garlic bread.....and that was it. 20-25 minutes later we still couldn't flag down and waiter or waitress to ask for a drink and to put in our order. They all seemed very disorganized and scrambling to serve other tables. We got upset and left when we noticed another couple had sat down, got drinks, and their food had arrived before we even got water!!! Seriously??? Bad service in every respect."}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian place in Indian land. My family comes here frequently when I'm in town visiting. They have a good selection of dishes on the menu including pasta, pizza, and subs. My mom, dad, and grandma love the spaghetti and meatballs. I've tried a bunch of different entrees including the seafood pastas, eggplant parm, and eggplant rollatini. All are excellent. My aunt likes the rigatoni or chicken parm. Everyone has a favorite pasta here. The sauce is thick and tasty. We also love the garlic knots which are served before the meal. They are usually piping hot and covered with olive oil and cooked garlic. We usually end up eating to many of them and then are not able to finish our meals, but that gives us leftovers for the next day which is nice. The servers are very friendly and remember us when we come back. We recently came here for my grandma's birthday, and they gave her a free dessert. She chose the cannoli which had fresh strawberries on the side. It has a thick filling which is rich and delicious. Overall a great place to come for a tasty Italian meal that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic pizza my family and I have been able to find since living in the South. It's very HARD to find good pizza especially in my household (The Mr. being from NYC and the little one and I from Chicago) considering we make our own dough from scratch and our pizzas as well.

We venture off to not have to do all the work and couldn't find a place worthy of our time until we stopped into Mamas after a long grocery trip to nearby Publix. 

Our first trip we dined in and this is where the 1star is missing. The hostess was awesome however the server was very unenthused about us as customers, he lacked good customer service and came off as a person who hated his job. We had the garlic knot appetizer which people rave about but I've had better. They are okay and may be amazing to those who never had any from a NY or Chicago pizzeria. We had a veggie filled pie with garlic and it was tasty.

Our next couple of trips we tried something new which my husband fell in LOVE with (Chicken Parmesan) sandwich. This sandwich is really good and HUGE, we usually get one and two to three people could share and be full.

The expansion that just happened was much needed for the small space. Now more tables and more customers to enjoy this great place."}
{"text":"We have been here several times since we found this hidden treasure! Staff and owners are a pleasure, and the food is excellent. 
Try to save room for the desserts, Heavenly!!
The Calzone is large enough for two or three, and the sauce is yummy! Everything we have tried has been spot on!"}
{"text":"Best Stromboli ever! Get it with ham cheese and onions and get a side of that creamy pesto to dip it in, you won't regret it!  also lasted me 3 full meals so delicious, currently eating my last piece now and I'm so sad. Ever had food that literally makes you dance because it's so good, cause this made me dance"}
{"text":"Talk about perfect omg it's like being back in NY. The food was great and the service.... Forget about it... It was outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered half cheese for the boys and half light jalapeños for the Wifey and I.  The genius chef dropped a bottle of jalapeños and even managed to get a few on the kids half.  We will stick with Lorenzo's.  Much better service and pizza."}
{"text":"Never again.  I thought I'd try Mama's again after not visiting for several months, only to discover they're using a cheaper, inferior tortellini pasta now.  That's it. I'm done. This place used to be so much better.  It's just not worth giving them any more chances to disappoint me."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice but needs some college education. The service was bad and it took about an hour to get the food."}
{"text":"Okay. Third time here. Food is very very good.  Service was way above average. I ordered the Mommas special which was way more than I could eat but every bite was delicious. The sauce,in my opinion, is a little bland but not bad. For the money it is a great choice."}
{"text":"Bad service, They forgot my food, can't clear the table. I'm done, I miss good NJ and NY service."}
{"text":"I had formerly rated Mama's 4 stars-3 for the food and an extra for the convenient IL location and kind service. 
Updating 5/23: Two nights ago I checked in after ordering delivery, which was very delayed. I called them again after waiting 2.5 hours for the pizza that was promised in 45 minutes. I canceled the order. The manager, Kathy, called me back later, apologized profusely, and offered a free pizza in the future. We took advantage of that free pizza offer tonight. The turnaround time was accurate tonight, however the pizza toppings were incorrect. We appreciated the free pizza after the previous inconvenience, but not sure what's going on here lately. Think we'll take a break for awhile."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight. They said that it would take an hour. An hour and a half later it's still not here and they can't find their driver. Refunded the money of course, but now it's 7:45 on a school night and my kids haven't had dinner. Hadn't ordered from here in a while bc we always have delivery issues but thought we'd give it one last shot. Too bad too because the food has been good in the past."}
{"text":"Went last evening. Had Cheese pizza and a chicken parm sub. Both were delightful. Mama's has a vary flavorful sauce which is the key to everything. I found their pizza on the same scale as the other pizza places in the area, Palone's, Lorenzo's, Tony's - and it was a bit less expensive.  The chicken parm sub was probably the best I've had in the 7 years living in the Charlotte area. The area really lacks a quality chicken parm sub. 

The service was attentive from the hostess to the wait staff. Didn't have to wait long for the knots and sauce to be brought to the table (free at dinner time at least)

Will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Went there a few minutes ago.  We were told to sit anywhere on the right hand side.  The first booth was dirty.  Then we moved to another, smaller booth and the bread plate was dirty.  Needless to say, we walked out the door. Not going to dine at a place that cannot keep tables and dishes clean.  But shouldn't have expected anything more since young kids were running the place."}
{"text":"Good place. Pies area great and they have a great selection of Italian. Fantastic service, they really take care of you. Not much beer or wine offering. If you like lots is sauce or cheese, get extra. Sparse on the regular pies."}
{"text":"Called in an order for delivery and had a couple questions (because the menu has 0 details). The person taking the order didn't know anything about the menu. Finally after being put on hold for the 4th time to answer a very simple question another woman got on the phone who knew the menu. She then told me she had 2 other deliveries in front of mine (at 4pm) so it would be 50 mins or so. No biggie. Food arrives and is all messed up. No salads. Guy said he would be right back with the salads and never showed up. Unfortunately, I had already given him a nice tip. Is it too much to ask for drivers to check their orders before they leave the store?? Entree portion sizes were sooooo tiny!! Medium pizza was a small. Just paid almost $60 for a meal and we are still hungry, aside from my 12 year old who ate the entire pizza."}
{"text":"This is our go to place in Waxhaw for Pizza. It's on 521 by Piblix. The food is do freaking good! I even started having their Antipasto salad and it's do good. The pizza here taste like if you're getting real NY pizza in the city. The freaking meatballs are to die for! All of their pasta dishes are really good and huge portions. All I can say us thank you Mama's for being in the neighborhood. They have a long list of desserts and just about everything is made in house. Also the sauce they use for pasta or in meatballs us to die for. Trust me you must come here! Lady staff is really friendly and are great!"}
{"text":"Be happy for this hard working family that started from scratch two years ago and now are expanding into adjacent space to double their dining area.  And they are expanding the kitchen to accommodate more customers.

Congratulations!

Good food, excellent menu, beer and wine, garlic rolls to die for and great, great service.

Catering is excellent.  For the past two years our pottery club has had them cater our annual party of over 100 members.  The food arrived hot and there were leftovers as their portions were more than ample.  Rave reviews from the club members who already want Mama's to cater our 2015 event.

New York style pizza along with all the pastas, Strombolis, salads, etc.  The full boat.

Join all the rest of us who love Mama's.  You will leave happy."}
{"text":"The pizza was just okay.  It was the average southern NY style pizza you get around here.  It did not compare to Junior's/Lorenzo's.  It was overcooked and almost burned.  The flavor just wasn't there although they were not skimpy with the toppings.  The wings were terrible.  They were breaded, which is a huge no-no.  They were also tiny, and served with ranch (another big no-no), and not carrots or celery.  They looked and tasted like they were pre-sauced and baked in an oven and not fried.  The people working were very nice, but I'm not in a hurry to return.  Thankfully Lorenzo's is just a few miles over the state line."}
{"text":"First time trying Mama's and I was skeptical because of bad reviews. I'm giving five stars tonight because I got my pizza quickly and it is delicious. Really good sauce and fresh mozzarella. Grandmas special. Will be back and can't wait to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Got the XL (18\") meat lovers pizza for pick up and as soon as I opened it I was impressed! Tons of meat topped high, generous with cheese and crust is good. Great pizza for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Dropped by recently to try it out. Weekday evening, the place was half filled and service was horrible. Maybe short staffed? But 3-4 people running around and order is taken, drinks and meals are dropped off without able to get a word in to get additional items. Staff disappears. Floor was greasy in some areas, with a few staff members slipping. Oil on the banquette cushion. Complimentary dough knots should not be called \"garlic knots\" since they taste nothing like garlic or oiled up like most actual garlic knots should be.  By the way, the \"olive oil\" they use is such an inferior low quality oil, it tasted more like cooking oil or vegetable oil in the bottle.  The Family Feast dish had a ton of stuff dumped on, but was really covered by a pound of cheese. The Bruschetta pizza was good, but missing a flavor, prob real extra virgin olive oil.  I was going to give this place 3 stars, but as I was writing this, it appeared I didn't like this place as much as I thought."}
{"text":"First time visit. Got their lunch special. 2 margarita slices and a soda for $ 6. Was delicious! Generous slices, fresh and authentic. Will be back! Great prices. Only complaint was no one came back to refill my soda."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding as always. Restaurant was very busy but we got our food very quickly and it was fresh, hot and extremely flavorful."}
{"text":"Went to counter to order 3 slices to go. Friendly staff. I was told it would take 15-20. This was 430 pm on Sunday. Took pizza home, 1 mile away. Pizza was not hot and mediocre at best. This place has gone downhill. This was my last visit."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happening at Mama's but what used to be a decent meal has gone to hell. Frozen breaded over fried  chicken used in chicken parmesan, spaghetti that was crunchy and sauce that tasted days old and almost sour.
This use to be a reliable restaurant for Italian food of at least average quality, but at least it was consistent. My last 3 trips there for take out have resulted in one wrong meal, one very overcooked meal and tonight chicken from 
a mcnuggets box with rubber cheese and sour sauce. Unless they come around I think their days are numbered. Sad..Oh and the young wait staff needs to be told not to be touching hair etc then boxing/bagging food."}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  I am really giving 4 stars due to the $5 lunch special.  You can't beat 2 slices and a drink for $5 including tax.  I always want to go on a Monday, which they are closed.  I am so glad that I found this place on the side of Publix's.  It is sometimes a little crowded, but we always manage to get a table with no wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in again tonight after a 6 month absence from a previous disappointment.  Unfortunately things have not changed.  Portions are so small. Large pizza looked like a small and there are only 5 raviolis per order.  I agree with the other reviewer and I'll be sticking with Lorenzo ' s in Blakeney or Tony's in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"This pizza joint was recommended to us by a friend who lives nearby. The pizza selection was large, so we had to order a meat lover's extra large. They also offer 2 slices of pizza with a drink at lunch for $5. The atmosphere was a little dead but it was also 11 in the morning on a Saturday. I'd recommend stopping here to try the pie."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Sunday night January 29th. Everyone enjoyed the meals they ordered.  The service getting rolls was very slow had to ask server after salads arrived. My family enjoys mamas but wish service time would improve. Arrived little after 6pm and walked out just before 8pm. I expect 60 to 90 minutes after being seated. Let me know if I should change my expectations at Mamas.  Thanks"}
{"text":"We recently ordered takeout (delivery to Waxhaw -- bonus!!) for our daughter's homecoming from college party. Ordering was very easy -- called in the day before. Delivery was on time and the food was excellent! I don't know what is in the baked ziti, but it is amazing. We also ordered penne with broccoli, a cheese pizza and garlic knots. It was all very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went to mamas and had the best meal I've had since I left New York The owner sal and his wife Kathy treated me like I was at home in New York I highly recommend going to see Sal and Kathy at mamas you will not regret it"}
{"text":"This place used to get a least 4 stars but not today
I ordered the \"special 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink \" a good deal if the pizza was any good wasn't today
Crust way too thick ( they used to have thin NY style crust) don't know what happened but crust in my option way too thick sauce seemed to be just lumped on the pizza and really had no taste 
Ordered it to stay in and it was brought to me in a take out box
Table wasn't very clean and soda machine was out of ice but they filled it up right away
With all of the \"New\" places that are soon going to be available to eat in I suggest that the owners of this restaurant get back on the ball and get things back to like they were
I know they can do it because everything used to be very good 
You can't rely on your laurels
Will give them another chance hopefully after they get back to being good again"}
{"text":"Picked up a Sicilian style pizza and a salad as a get well dinner for a friend...totally delicious and made a wonderful gift for this friend"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a co-worker. I had a grilled chicken salad. The homemade balsamic dressing was AMAZING! My coworker had two slices of pizza and said it was really good too. The server was very attentive and super friendly. He even gave me an extra dressing to take home which I definitely used. Will absolutely be returning to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Mamas Pizza was well received when they initially opened. The area did not have a family restaurant like it. The food was handmade and you could certainly taste that there was nothing packaged. Unfortunately, more recently, just the opposite is the case. Chicken parmesan was obviously prepackaged and the taste was awful.It is a shame that they could not keep up with their initial high quality."}
{"text":"Very good food. I heard it was authentic Italian food,and it was the best  Italian I have ever had,truly puts places like Olive Garden to shame.  Prices were good,service was very good and helpful with understanding the different dish.We will be back,my husband said he has a new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience overall.  Awful.  Friday night went there with my mother, we got there around 7:30.  It was busy.  There was no hostess and it got a crowded at the door with people coming in.  About 5 minutes later she arrived.  They sat us next to the kitchen door.  OK - that's no biggie we didn't asked to be moved.  Some nice lady brought us hot bread with marinara right away and that was nice - and that's where it ended.  We waited at least 15 minutes before a waiter FINALLY arrived.  When he did I asked if he could just take our whole order because I didn't think I'd see him again.   Our bread basket was empty.  He didn't clear anything or ask if we wanted more.  OK - I can deal with that. 

Our oh so \"Very complicated\" order was a glass of water and a glass of iced coffee.  Two salads which obviously don't have to be cooked and a \"togo\" order for my son which could be brought out later as communicated.  

The wait ensued.  I looked at my watch and at 8:10 we still didn't have a drink on the table.  I finally stopped the other waiters/bussers/hostesses who walked by our table numerous times and could see we had been sitting there forever, and asked them if we could get our drinks.  (BTW - dirty bread plates/baskets still on the table), instead of getting us some water they went back to our waiter who arrived with our water an coffee.  By this time the place had cleared out - so it wasn't busy.   

Now we wait for our food. And wait.  And wait.  at 8:25 I'm livid, the night is ruined. I would have walked out but at this point, it was late.  We ask if someone could get us our stinking food. He brings two us our two bowls of iceberg lettuce.  I had ordered a greek salad - I got iceberg lettuce with some bottle olives and some tomatoes.  My mother ordered the antipasto which was a bowl of iceberg lettuce with some meat on top.  I ask the waiter to just bring out our togo order and the check.  A manager stops by and says \"Oh I heard you had to wait a few minutes for your food.\"  I guess if you call waiting an hour for some iceberg lettuce and some water \"a few\" minutes.    She offers some free desserts.  I don't really care about dessert or free. What I wanted was an enjoyable relaxing dinner.   But my mom says ok.  The waiter brings us the check and our togo orders.  He mentions that we're getting free desserts so he knew about it.  He brings us a bag for the to go order picks up the credit card.  Brings it back.  Never mentions or brings the dessert... nothing.    Was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  Their pizza may be good, I don't know.  But no pizza is worth the rotten service of this restaurant.  I will not be back and I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent family pizza place. If you like New York style Italian and pizza, you've found your spot.

We ordered the \"Grandma\" and it was really good. They use their plum tomato marinara on it instead of their pizza sauce and the flavor was spectacular. My daughter got the kids ravioli ($4.99 drink included!!) and it came with melted mozzarella on the top.. which she loved! We got dinner and lunch out of both the pizza and her kids ravioli.

Ordered side salads which were cheap, by comparison to other places.. at $2.95. Believe me, the salad was not worth more than 2.95, but kudos for them pricing it as such... the dressings are home made, though, which is a plus.

We did not get a dessert, but they are also apparently made in house... except the cannoli shells. We will dive into the dessert tray next time. The only mistake our server made was not mentioning the desserts.. but in his defense, we appeared to be in a rush and he probably decided we were not going to be interested.. HOWEVER, had he mentioned all of the house made items on their dessert menu, we probably would have ordered something."}
{"text":"I live in Charlotte and it is well worth the drive out here to delve into the pasta, pizza!
I have had both pizza and pasta.  Pasta is my favorite.  Spaghetti is cooked aldente Both the Sausage and the Meatballs are done to perfection and the marinara sauce...I told the manager and chef that if I Drowned in a pool filled with it I would die a happy man, yes it's that good! 
The only negative is they play a lot of Celine Dion..."}
{"text":"Poor experience and even worse food, very disappointing!! Messed up me order, sent 2 different drives (one of which got
Lost and couldn't find my house). Please spend you money at Dominos or Papa Johns as it is better quality and by far better priced!!"}
{"text":"If you must order here, NEVER ORDER AT THE COUNTER!  We made that mistake and it took them FORTY-FIVE MINUTES to get us our food!  Mostly because they kept giving our food away (a series of people ordering the same special) to phone orders that came after us.  It wasn't fun watching as our food walked out the door several times over with people who ordered long after us, just because they didn't take down our order properly at the counter.  At any point the owner could have put the six teenagers milling about the register to work making pizzas instead of making easy money by doing nothing.  This will be the last time we order from this place.  There are better pizza places with better employees and MUCH better food.  I guess our pizza was ice cold because it was the only part of the order they had right all along.  I can't imagine wasting another dime on this place."}
{"text":"They have really excellent prices and friendly service. The complimentary  garlic knots are a great touch, but unfortunately I did not care for the marinara sauce which was WAY too sweet. I ordered the chicken franchese- it wasn't the best I've ever had but it certainly wasn't the worst. My side salad had great italian dressing- but I am not much of an iceburg lettuce fan. 

Their specials and prices are so good id give them another try...I just wouldn't get anything with that marinara on it."}
{"text":"This was just an okay experience for me. A friend that speaks highly of this place brought me along. You enter a dark, no frills strip mall restaurant.

They have a very small bottled beer selection. I ordered a small side salad to eat beforehand. They speak highly their homemade dressing. I did not order one of those. My dressing was just a standard dressing. The complimentary garlic knots were a nice addition.

I ended up deciding on a flatbread. It was flat and crispy, indeed. It tasted okay. The table behind us had several issues with their entire evening. I can definitely see how that could happen. Our waitress seemed confused about a few things. I may go back. I hear the desserts are very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is hidden! It's to the right of Publix if that helps! I have been here a few times without any issues. Service is good and the restaurant was really nice. 

We have gotten pizza from here before. We have tried the cheese pizza and margherita pizza. Both pizzas were good and flavorful. Pizza is a little greasy but that's ok. Flavor was there! They also have random weekday specials too!"}
{"text":"For this location and where I am, it's definitely one of the better spots for Italian.  If it was in NYC or other major cities, I would of rated it a bit less.  Regardless, I'm grateful that this place opened up near work.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. We had pizza and eggplant rollatini. I would not consider this authentic Italian cuisine. The free garlic knots were good and a nice touch."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The Alfredo sauce was watery, chicken was bland. Meat ball parm was okay but it's hard to mess that up. I don't know, maybe I'm just used to New York Italian."}
{"text":"4.5 Great food, calamari was spot on. Chicken Marsala was fair. My husband chicken arriibata was better. Kids pizza was good. Way to full for dessert and three to go boxes to travel home. They have like teenage boy servings. Wait staff  was friendly. Very busy for a place I couldn't find it from road its to the right of Publix. Will defiantly come again. Menu very large good for group every one will have something here. They do have chicken fingers for kids even though not listed on menu."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place in Indian Land. The grandma and grandpas pies are both made with great ingredients. The wait can be pretty long for delivery but as long as you plan ahead it's totally fine. I tend o like more \"local\" feeling places vs the chains so this is right up my ally."}
{"text":"Like someone else mentioned, you have to hunt to find their location the first time going. I gave up and had them deliver my pizza. Since we just moved into the area from NJ and were used to Philly and NY pizzas, I have to say their pizza was on par with the pies from Philly & NY. No complaints here and we will be going there to sample their dinners shortly."}
{"text":"I've got to agree with some of the posts. The crust tastes pre-made and is burned more times than not. Garlic rolls cold too.  The servers are aloof and don't seem to care about their service. 

I'm sad about this.  I love coming here because of the atmosphere and location.  Please get it together.  Fresh prep goes a long way with customers."}
{"text":"Used to be good but the quality and service had seriously deteriorated. If you fine in, the service is terrible and yet you see a dozen employees ( all young teens) standing around with nothing to do.  If you carry out, the pizza is half burned with missing or no topics, no sauce or cheese and it's over an hour wait. This past Wednesday we ordered two pizzas and it was absolutely terrible and we had to wait over an hour to pick it up and we spent more than $25. This is the last time we order pizza or go to the restaurant. They will not survive if they don't improve."}
{"text":"Quality of food is not good.  They sell pizza by the slice, so we ordered one with chicken and they basically took a cheese pizza slice, warmed it up, they cut little squares of chicken, a the they put the cold pieces of chicken on top and served them.  The chicken tenders and fries are greasy (kids) and overall not happy with service and food."}
{"text":"wish I could have something positive to say, but nothing positive about dinner at Mammas last night. Garlic rolls weren't garlicy enough. Service started out good but then food took almost an hour to come out.  2 entrees were ok. had to ask for and wait for an extra plate to share a lasagna which had been delivered. 2 entrees didn't come for another 10 minutes. the pizza was completely wrong when it came so we sent it back and told them to forget about it. shared the calzone which was not very good in my opinion. the waitress kept apologizing. once would have been enough.  too many other places to choose from.... won't be back."}
{"text":"Fed up with lousy service 3 of 6 visits received entirely wrong meal. Last vIsit wrong meal, incomplete meal and cold bad bread, no excuse it was very quiet. Sweat Sauce, meatball, sausage very good, pasta is ehh at best. It's a shame, enjoy the atmosphere. Think we're done."}
{"text":"I love the food at Mama's but the service is not the best. Our server, Connor should probably choose another profession. The salads were delivered to the table and we had to wait for utensils to eat with. Our entree came to the table in a timely manner but four out of the seven people at our table still did not have the drinks that they ordered so my husband had to ask for those to be brought to the table. Lastly, he brought our check, my husband put cash with the check and we waited and waited for change. Connor brought the change back with no explanation why he had shorted us $4 in change. Like I said our server should probably rethink his current profession!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times & I always always order my Favorite dish Fried Calamari. Family have had Garlic knots (free if You dine in), Sausage & Chicken Parmesan heros always great. Pizza is okay. Maybe cause  I'm from NY just not the same."}
{"text":"First experience here was amazing!! The chicken parm Stromboli is heavenly! I'd also recommend their cheesecake. So worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"I had the bruschetta chicken flatbread that was so delicious!  Highly recommend. My husband had the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo that he also highly recommends. Garlic rolls were a little cold in the middle. The reason I didn't give it a 5 Star is because they don't have pizza by the slice. Otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"Ummmm no

Two stars cuz it smelled good and the staff was friendly. Got a take-out 16\" and the dough was tasteless and very thick in some parts and hard as cardboard on the bottom. Couldn't fold it. The cheese was rubbery.  I ate 1/2 a slice and gave up. Do yourself a favor and drive to Tony's for your NY pizza fix."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. I had a Calzone with spinach mushrooms and sausage. My wife and daughter had a regular pepperoni pizza.
Both were great and served hot. 
Side salad was fresh and delish.
We started with the broccoli Raub, mainly because I've never had it before, anywhere, so wanted to try it. I was certainly satisfied. 
Great food, service is good, portions are huge, you will be taking something home.
See you next week!"}
