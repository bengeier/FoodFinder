{"text":"OMG!!! I hate greasy wings, but I was craving them. I read the review on yelp( THX!!!) and decided to try it. I was not expecting to be so overwhelmed with such yumminess. I was floored by the abundant amount of meat. I was overjoyed and I know it sounds stooge, but I was really happy, and full. I don't want wings from anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Ya... No!. 
There are pictures of New York on the walls but if you want New York pizza,  this ain't it!  I've been coming here for years on occasion when I have nowhere else to go and while it's consistent,  it's not really very good.  The cheese is kinda greasy and soft,  probably cheaper.  I don't remember ever seeing grease float on top of a cheese pizza but it does here. The sauce is essentially flavorless and the crust,  while crispy is also totally lacking in flavor.  I don't know what it is,  but it's definitely not new York."}
{"text":"I wish to share my very good experience with Pisa Pizza.  The dough is crispy and fresh, the pizza very flavorful, and the order prepared quickly by a friendly staff.  Overall a very good value.  I'll be back.

I wanted to address a prior review.  C N gave this place three stars.  Let me tell you, from him, THAT'S AMAZING!  Read his prior reviews.  THIS GUY IS A TOTAL BUTCHER.  All he does is complain about peripheral things at every place he goes, (weak wifi on the patio?!?!?  WAAAAAHHHH!!!!) and then makes himself feel better by using words like \"shame\" and \"avoid.\"   Are the wings at Pisa Pizza perfect?  NO!  It's a pizza place.  Get a life.  

If you pay any attention to his reviews, SHAME on you.  AVOID listening to C N. and give Pisa Pizza a try."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. I stopped in to grab a drink. It smelled so good and the guy was making a Stromboli in the window I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The people were super nice and the pizza was great"}
{"text":"Get the Sicilian thick pizza with pepperoni and extra sauce.. It's the best ever!"}
{"text":"I don't normally take precious time out of my life to complain however in this case I think it is warranted.  I called in to place my order and wanted 2 pizzas, each with two toppings.  I had a coupon for two free toppings on any pizza delivery.  I was told it would be $20. and change.  My fault for not asking how much each pizza was in the first place, lesson learned.  What I got was one pizza with 4 toppings.  Now being in the restaurant industry myself I know that mistakes happen.  I also know that regardless of who's mistake it is mine or my customer's it is my best interest to keep my customer happy and fix the problem.  My biggest complaint is that I told the order taker on the phone three (3) times (at least) what I wanted and plainly told him I wanted two (2) pizzas with two toppings on each one so that I could use my coupon.  I proceeded to call pisa pizza back and ask where my other pizza was.  After speaking to the owner, the delivery guy and the order taker again to get my second pizza and bantering back and forth I decided I didn't that second pizza for fear of what might be on it. I will admit I got into a little heated discussion with Lucky the owner and perhaps said some insulting things about his cardboard pizza that I regret.  I was serious when I told him I have had better pizza for less money!   End of story I paid $23.00 for a cardboard pizza.  I will never patronage this place again I don't care if it the only pizza place in Fountain Hills.  Sigh.....Why couldn't I bring my pizzamania pizza joint with me when I moved from CA."}
{"text":"The thin slice veggie with pepperoni pizza was really good especially at 3am!!! Luckily they're open late and easy to stop by on the go. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"New to Fountain Hills....after reading many reviews on the FH Connection I thought I would give it a try....WORST PIZZA EVER!! Better off buying a frozen Tombstone!"}
{"text":"Very nice people but don't waste your money on the pizza. Generic fast food pizza. I've had Better frozen pizza from Costco. We ordered two pizzas.. One cheese,  one white chicken garlic. The chicken garlic had cardboard generic crust, with no garlic or white sauce. When I complained about it the manager \"Lucky\" said he was very busy this night and he noticed that the white pizza had no garlic sauce on the pizza we bought. So he essentially agreed with our complaint and yet he refused to refund is for that pizza. We spent $51 dollars and we were only asking for a refund of $12.95... He first said he didn't know how to refund money then he said he wouldn't do it. He basically told me to come back to get a free pizza... Omg we don't want anymore if their pizza. Bad all the way around. Stay home and order Dominos you will have a better pizza."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was very bomb. didn't expect to get good pizza in Vegas but this definitely exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered mushrooms, apparently they come from a can. I ordered spinach which is cut up into little cooked sprinkle. Don't come here if you are expecting fresh \"gourmet\" ingredients."}
{"text":"Best  pizzas pepperoni.    spacial when u on way or back the club!! #pizza manchis.  Viva Las Vegas main location strip and crazy times"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona!  I'm a pizza snob and this is no run of the mill pizza.  We love the sausage pizza. The kids like pepperoni of course. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat I walked in and ordered a slice it was really the best pizza I had and I'm comparing it to NY pizza very good must eat thank you guys"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The pizza is great. I like thin crust. The calzones are fantastic as well. Will keep going for a long time."}
{"text":"We were visiting a friend in FH and we put on the GPS and we were close to PIsa Pizza so we stopped in.  The three of us each had a lunch special.  The three of us ate for under $15.  The slices were as close to NY as we have had since we moved to AZ.  The staff was very pleasant and the restaurant was clean and bright.  Best of all it is one of the only pizza/Italian restaurants that I have been to in and around the valley that has \"shrimp parmagiana\" on the menu.  I can't wait until my next visit to try it."}
{"text":"This location is no longer in business. We were given a gift certificate and they closed down. We called the Fountain Hills location and that is how we found out. I was forced to give a rating but since I never ate their food I cant say. I gave one star only because I had no choice."}
{"text":"My go to place in Fountain Hills for NY style pizza. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY so it can be difficult to find what I would call 'good' pizza. This place fits the bill. Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for the strip! easy, fast, and doesn't break the pocket"}
{"text":"I would not know how the pizza is as they were incapable of knocking or calling to announce their presence. We found a note on our door that they had tried to deliver but that we hadn't answered. When we called they wanted to deliver the same cold pizza. We refused and we were verbally abused not only by the son who's the \"manager\" and who apparently delivers without a phone or knuckles (or perhaps he wore them off dragging them on the ground) but we also had the joy of his father the owner yelling at us. 4 thumbs down from this household."}
{"text":"We were looking for something to eat at 1:00 am in the morning and we got to Pisa Pizza not only we got to meet the owner but he was nice and got a excellent customer service and of course the Pizza was delicious! perfect crust and flavor! If you go to Las Vegas you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"The best wings in Fountain Hills!  Great lunch special too.  Sausage pizza is top notch.  My momma likes their lasagna.  When you got that fix, they hit the spot."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza.  Wings are ok.  Asked for artichoke with chicken and mushroom. Got anchovies with chicken and mushroom.   Customer service had trouble speaking English, which explains the problems.   Crust was tough and pizza was cold when we picked up within timeframe.  Wings were ok.  I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ate here at midnight at the beginning of our vacation. The guy even mentioned that the stuff was old saying \"let me get you a newer one\". He got severe food poisoning and had to go to the emergency room and ended up spending the rest of his vacation in bed. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've had in a long time! Legit! Eli makes a special pizza called a \"pinwheel\". Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Stromboli was bad.  Tasted like it had been sitting there for the whole day and had almost no filling at all.  There're plenty of other places to eat in that area.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The garlic knots and calzones on display looked good but the slice I received was completely unappetizing- $6 veggie slice wasn't even as good as a generic frozen pie and was taken directly out of a warmer and slapped on a paper plate. They could at least reheat to order, but in addition to being lukewarm, this slice looked visibly old. The crust was thick and flavorless like cardboard in the middle and crispy shards like a tostada on the edges. I liked that the sauce was slightly spicy but the pizza was not good."}
{"text":"I live in Fountain Hills and strongly believe in supporting our local small businesses. I actively seek out these places and give them multiple opportunities to wow me. And I have been pleasantly and surprisingly wowed by many of our town establishments. Based on the reviews here, I knew I had to give Pisa Pizza a try. It was...okay, but not great. If you're going to do thin crust pizza, I want the crust to be crisp and maybe I've just had odd experiences, but I've never gotten the crunch I was looking for. Toppings are okay, but nothing surprising or unique. In addition, it's a small place without much ambience, so I always order ahead for take-out. For whatever reason, every time I've called and ordered pizza and was told how long it would take, when I went to pick it up, it hadn't even been started yet. It's not that the place was busy and they were running behind - at most there were one or two other people waiting for their pizza. If you tell me 15 minutes and I get there 15 minutes later, I don't expect to wait another half hour."}
{"text":"Pizza is very delicious they have a lot to choose from. The pizza is a little oily the slices are very thin. I think pisa pizza and rosattis are the two best pizza spots in fountain hills. But I gotta say it does not taste like New York pizza."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. Had the margarita pizza and wings. The pizza was great crust spot on sauce really good. That being said there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza nor did it have fresh basil or fresh tomatoes. Unfortunately this was not a true margarita pizza. The wings were awesome cooked perfectly. I did ask for them to be extra saucy and they did not have extra sauce on them. There sauce on the pizza is great I will be going back to try something else since they know how to make sauce and dough."}
{"text":"So,  my husband and I are staying at Inn on Eagle Mountain. We  order food from here. After and hour,  we receive part of our order (missing a salad) and no silverware or napkins. Upon calling, we are told that they do not provide silverware or napkins, making it impossible to eat the ravioli. I am stunned. I have never had food delivered anywhere of any kind that doesn't provide the basic essentials to eat.  And hungry. And really pissed. I wish I could give more information,  but not being able to eat the food, impossible. They are supposed to be bringing the salad (I asked just based on principle), but 45 minutes later,  it still hasn't arrived. No. Wait. The salad has arrived. With silverware. And napkins   After I was told overt the phone  that they do not provide it."}
{"text":"Had pizza here twice (I usually give everyone a second chance). Totally disappointed both times. The last time I ordered a pan pepperoni for me & the mrs. Was told it would be ready in half an hour... I showed up, and they were just starting to make it. Waited another 45 minutes, was \"done\", so I took it home, the outer crust was done, the center 2/3rds was RAW dough. Threw it in the garbage... Wont be back...sorry!"}
{"text":"Update.   Unfortunately this location closed down.  



This is a new place and the appearance outside is nothing to write about.   It simply was the closest place to our house so we thought we would give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Inside the place is casual and friendly. 

The pizza is excellent and authentic home made!  Nothing here seems to be pre made.  The pizza and wings special is too good. 

I have since been back 4 times, with all of my family... with a large group and for lunch.  Sandwiches, salads and pizzas are awesome.  I Highly recommend that if you are in the area, stop in and check it out.  

It's one of those places that I hope survives, the people are nice, the food is great and the atmosphere is comfortable."}
{"text":"Anyone who has rated 4 stars or more is probably a visitor to US and does not know what good pizza tastes like. Tried it coz it had 4* rating. Was it cheap for the location (approx $6.5 for a small slice) yes, edible yes. Good taste, hell no."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews but this one I had to... Best NYC pizza is actually in vegas, whaaahh?   I'm a huge mushroom buff so I was impressed with how fresh the veggies were and cooked just right.. had to go a second stop while in town.... solid choice."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch at Pisa Pizza in the Grand Bazaar Shops. We ordered a large vegetarian with 2 cokes and honestly had one of the best lunches during our trip to Vegas! The pizza dough was just right- cooked to perfection, they also didn't skimp on the cheese and toppings.  We sat there and ate the whole pizza ourselves and wanted more. The coke was from the glass bottle nice and cold- this was the perfect meal! We are planning on picking up another pie on our way home and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I remember 4-5 months ago (yes, that's how bad it was) getting a Margarita Pizza..i believe it was a \"normal\" crust. But I wouldn't think so by looking at it. Super doughy and by the time it was delivered to me the top of the pizza had come off on the top of the pizza box. After scraping it off onto the pizza I still found it to be a very bland tasting pie. Not much seasoning. The sauce was probably the worst part because it was just caked in it and tasted like it came out of a can! I highly don't recommend."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while walking the strip with my girlfriend. The pizzas are amazing, they have a unique taste that I haven't experienced that flavor for a long long time. Amazing! The pizzas were fresh and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great! I'm from New York City and I approve this restaurant. Great tasting! One of the best pizza spots in Arizona for sure. Its hard to find good tasting pizza in this state but this restaurant has the recipe right. I got a medium pie and enjoyed it. I recommend this place. You can get 2 slices and a drink for $4.50 during lunch hours. They have a television on each side of the restaurant and there's a nice little seating area right outside with a cover over it to block the sun while you enjoy great food and fresh air."}
{"text":"Visited here from New Jersey where we have REAL pizza. And this place has REAL pizza. Quality Roma products and really cool staff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had the cheese calzone and  the cheese pizza. The place had fast and friendly service, good deals :) the place was pretty clean and had nice seating. I will be sure tell my friends and I will come back soon."}
{"text":"I got a meatball parm and my girlfriend got a chicken parm. Sauce was great, as was the chicken and meatballs. Plenty of cheese and everything was toasted nicely. Sandwich hoagie was great, nice old school bread taste. Food did take a little while, but we sat out at the counter and people watched, so it went by quickly."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly service! The most reasonable prices on the boulevard! I definitely recommend everyone to go eat there. Try the chicken parmesan sub with the garlic knots. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"Great place! Meatball sub is heaven and the prices are great. Definitely will be back!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Vegas with my kids so I never even think about looking for Pizza with all the amazing food that it available. But the last time I went to Vegas, I had my kids with me as we were driving to Utah and decided to spend the night in Vegas. We stayed at the Paris hotel and once we checked in, my kids were hungry and the only thing they wanted to do after a 7 hour drive from Los Angeles was Pizza and movies. I asked the concierge where to get Pizza from and he suggested Pisa Pizza which was a block away. I went with his suggestion and walked there. The moment I walked into the place I knew it was a great suggestion. The smell of the pizza was amazing and the people working there were great as well. I ordered a couple of pizzas with toppings and a calzone for me. The toppings were fresh and the calzone was nice and firm and not runny like some other calzones that I've had in the past. The combination of the fresh ingredients and the amazing dough was great. Upon returning to my room, my kids devoured the pizzas. Overall I was really happy with the food and the service. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get away from the usual hotel food."}
{"text":"Came here hungry and left out satisfied. I'm from New Jersey so I know good pizza when I taste it. Definitely the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but worth the money !!! Would definitely come back !! Honestly I'm just doing this review for the free drink and it won't let me save unless I type more so..."}
{"text":"In a city with excellent food and service, this is far below the standards that are set!  Had old pizza sitting out, asked for a cheese slice, and they gave me two that you could tell had been sitting forever and were not even being kept warm!  I saw them finish a brand new cheese pizza and i asked if i could have those slices, and was told \"no\". 

go anywhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice server. Good service.
Very yummy pizzas with good flavors.
But a bit of a soggy bottom under the crust. 

I change from 4 to 5 just because they improve a lot from the last time I eat her..
Keep going guys very good pizza !!!"}
{"text":"Dissappointing to say the least. Pizza crust is good but the add on's are just thrown on to a piece of cheese pizza and called good. Ray's still has the best by the slice! I won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Great and fresh food, great costumer service! 
We were at Vegas for the weekend and stooped by few times to have some lunch and late dinner calzone and pizza. 
The manager Eli was great, friendly and helpful! 
Definitely something to cheer you up after losing money at the casino lol 
A++++++++"}
{"text":"First off, let's be honest, Fountain Hills has very few \"good\" restaurants.  We live in Fountain Hills and usually head to Scottsdale for dining. There are only a handful of decent choices  (El Encanto, saddle bronc grille, American Sports Bar and Soffrtas) and this is the best for Italian.  We don't eat-in here  but place orders and pick it up. Their eggplant parmassean dinner is excellent, baked ziti was also good, but needed more seasoning. (We just added some Italian seasoning at home). We have also ordered a thin crust pizza with mushrooms, olives and fire roasted eggplant that also was verygood-- coming from Chicago we know you are going to get really good pizza! We will definitely try some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"If all you want is a slice or two, this is your go to place. The slices are not small, they are nice sized slices. Good flavor overall,  too. Great variety always available."}
{"text":"well i cant begain to give this place 5 stars  but i will say the staff is pleasant the aumbience is charming and the food is good being a meatball mainiac i had to order a side  just to try them 4 small balls $2 in a tomato(mine are much better) sauce my wife had a small salad which was fresh and chilled just the right amount and we ordered a large pizza w/4 toppings and a thin crust ....not as thin as i like 19.95 and a bottle of wine  we had pleanty of leftovers and they do  home deliveries. worth a try"}
{"text":"Small slices for xlarge prices $5.50 and up,
Subs $4.50 for junior size 4-5 inch with two meatballs cut in half to make it look like four on the sub.. Way over priced good luck with repeat customers lol.. And not even fast service with no crowd,, that should have told me to stay away"}
{"text":"As anyone that lives here knows, Arizona is a Pizza desert. Pisa Pizza is fantastic! The toppings are delicious and generous. Great sauce and crust. If you are in the area, I would recommend trying out Pisa Pizza, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times. It's been a little inconsistent. When it's good, it's really good. But a couple times it's been really overcooked. Today it was overcooked to the point where it was hard to chew."}
{"text":"Visited 4/24/2018
After drinking and walking for hours.. again after walking and drinking for hours lol This was heaven! I know it was after midnight and the Staff was still pumping out pizzas.  They were young attractive and seemed to be happy making pizza and interacting with the Customers.  If you need a bite to eat on the go.. stop at Pisa Pizza which is located in the busy Vegas Strip area."}
{"text":"Great homemade Stromboli, thank you Jeffrey and thanks to Eli great good! Stop in and grab a bit, pizza and more."}
{"text":"Had one piece of the white pizza, and threw the rest of the $17.00 in the trash, unfortunately I had taken this to go and didn't want to make the trip back I was so disgusted. Maybe the normal pizzas are OK. I've had whites in Chicago, St. Louis...this was just wrong. I really try to support local business, but not for these prices/value."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small with seating for maybe 4 people, but the pizza is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"I like Pisa Pizza. No, it's not NY style, and thank goodness for that.  Isn't that why we're on the opposite side of the country LOL.  It's a family run operation, and they seem to take pride in their store. I like that. 

I've eaten there probably 6-8 times, mostly for their lunch specials. Every time I go there, I'm met with a smile, a \"hello\", quick service, and good food, at a fair price.

I recommend."}
{"text":"PISA PIZZA is amazing! The sauce has so much flavor and the food is hot and fresh. Don't forget the garlic knots!!!! Also, the people are super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I love Pisa Pizza!! And so does my entire household! I am the daughter of a native born Italian mother, and we all agree that Pisa Pizza is awesome. There is a certain yumminess to the crust that can't be described. And they deliver - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My #1 pizza place in town. I've been coming here for years. Pizza is fresh & the sauce is amazing. This is the only pizza joint I go to where I can order a simple cheese pie and it has lots of flavor. Owners are friendly & they deliver!"}
{"text":"I have had the pizza here a few times when I come from NY to visit my parents. It's pretty good pizza. I just ate there tonight though and it was fantastic. Perfectly crisp and flavorful. The restaurant is clean and the owners/servers are very nice.  Overall a good choice for a small pizza place"}
{"text":"Pisa Pizza is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops. I stopped by for lunch and was very disappointed. The place is small, but does offer limited seating. The prices are absolutely outrageous for what you get. They have a couple of menu boards posted however the small paper menu had different prices. Not good business to advertise the slices for less than you are actually charging, it's fraud. All the menus posted and given for customers to take with them should have the same prices. Employees (2 girls were working) acted like they didn't want to be there and had no problem using profanity to each other during conversation. The employees working need to realize that not all of their customers are tourists and will not tolerate being treated as such. Maybe if they treated everyone like a local who would be a possible repeat customer they would have more business, but we see into that sort of shit right away. I'll pass on this place in the future. 

Pepperoni Slice ($6.25) - Horrible. Simply horrible. The slice was very small and the sauce tasted terrible. The crust was so hard that if I threw it against the wall, I'm sure it would shatter. If I didn't see the girl stretching dough I'd think this was a frozen pizza heated up. Overpriced and totally not worth it. 

Cherry Coke 20 oz ($3.25) - What a rip! The girl claimed the fountain machine was broke and only had bottled soda/water. I chose a 20 oz Cherry Coke and my jaw dropped when I saw the price. If their machine is broke they should still charge fountain drink prices on the bottles."}
{"text":"I popped into Pisa Pizza tonight for a quick slice and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Im usually a NY style thin crust kinda girl, but their dough is just tooooooooo good !! Great location on the strip. I will definitely stop by here again !"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the  veggie pizza and friendly people who work here.  It's located in the Bally's marketplace bazaar on the Las Vegas Strip across the street from Bellagio.  They have pizza by the slice or whole pies.  It's homemade and really good!  You can get food to go or they have a small seating area with barstools inside.  There are outside tables for takeout food throughout the area."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pisa Pizza for years, and it's almost always amazing. Their pizza is the best, but their wings are just okay."}
{"text":"Oh my..... hungry or not this is the place to be at any times specifically in the late hours into the night do yourself a favor and go eat and take some to your love ones fast service fresh food served upon requesting it. Long story short enjoy your next pizza AT.. Pisa pizza thx for Raul for the great service"}
{"text":"Working at the grand bazaar, places to eat are very limited. I managed to find a place where they serve delicious pizza, fabulous sandwiches and many other options. They  also have options for those who don't eat meat. Love it see you soon"}
{"text":"In terms of sustinance, Pisa works just fine.  The expectation that a hot and fresh slice is available any time of day is  a pipe dream.  I asked for a slice of cheese at 4pm, and I got what I deserved...a slice that's been chillin under a heat lamp with no discernable taste and cardboard texture.  Though I am grateful for the nutrients that it provided so that I could tackle Sin City nightlife...hence 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Not only was the pizza underwhelming.. Normally a pizza by the slice place will bring your slice up to temperature... This slice wasn't fresh and was just handed out of the warmer window 

The employee wasn't welcoming or friendly... And I'm addition.. He wore his gloves when serving the slice but also when changing my money and handing me the change. 

We stepped outside to try this terrible pizza and looked in the window and the employee just went back to work, gloves on after handling money, grabbed a hand full of cheese and began making a new pizza. Absolutely disgusting. 

Was going to make it a point to bring it to his attention.. But what's the point. Never coming back. If I could give a lower rating I would."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating a mushroom pizza from  Pisa Pizza.   Nice People running the place. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Nice little Pizza Joint on the strip.  Watch them make everything from scratch right in front of you.  Good selection from Garlic knots Strombolis to stuffed pizzas.  Highly reccomend to any1 looking for a quick bite to eat and have amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was great pizza because I was drunk or hungry.  Either way, it was good. A small piece for the price.  But, good regardless."}
{"text":"never again,
Their pizza not for me.. Way to salty. Alot of better places
In fountain hills to get a non salty pie."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty expensive for one slice, about 5.50, but delicious at 3am! Very good service. The man serving us was very friendly and gave us a free garlic knot since they were closing soon. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Small hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The pizza was good. I got a combo that included 2 pieces of pizza and a drink for under $15. Cant beat that. The restaurant was clean. The man working the evening I went was a SUPER friendly guy. Id definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good - maybe 3.5 stars. Well priced, thin crust, good dough (made fresh every day) and flavorful toppings.

The problem is the chicken wings. AVOID!! Super small, almost all flats, no sauce to speak of (supposedly hot), lots of nasty looking wings, greasy, meatless, etc. Gross!"}
{"text":"First time here and Eli was a great guy first time he did Apple Pay. Great pizza close to the hotel"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the medium sized salads should be considered small size as I wanted the regular garden salad but they only use iceberg lettuce in the garden salad which has little or no nutrition value. So had to get the mediterranean salad which they make with romaine lettuce.  But it was on the small size and not big enough to share with others like other places int town  but they do give you 3 garlic knots with it as long as you remind them otherwise if you do not ask them they will not include them even though it says they are included on the menu.  Also not sure what is going on with their pizza but it is very dry, not enough sauce or cheese and no taste.  This place is not owned by Italian family it changed ownership and is own by a family from Albania.  It is cool to hear they speak in their language.  Their pasta is not homemade and they do cater.  The place smells real nice inside and they are friendly but wished they made their pizza better needs more sauce and way more cheese.  With so many other pizza places in town good to try them all.  This is not the place for my family to go to unless of course they start making better pizza."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill starting this spring. May be under new management or something.  Was still with the pain in the ass hours and service but food quality has pretty much gone down to AZ standards when it was the closest thing you could get to NY pizza in town.   Now standard cardboard style pizza with little taste and pigeon wings."}
{"text":"Good for a late night to get fresh pizza in Vegas.Thin crust,variety of slices.Friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Had two pepperoni slices that tasted worse than the ones they used to sell at the pizza huts in target. Also for $2.99 you get a 24 oz soda or should I say a 24 oz cup filled 2/3 with ice and some splashes of whatever soft drink you ordered. $10+ I would have wanted to waste playing the slots."}
{"text":"Undercooked, doughy crust.  Completely uninspiring and bland.  You're much better off with one of the other hundreds of food choices within the one block vicinity."}
{"text":"One of the few delivery options in Fountain Hills. My suggestion is to try the Garlic Bread w/Mozzarella and the Chicken Brianna - they are very good! My experience has been friendly staff and delivery drivers."}
{"text":"Good surprise did not expect a good pizza 
in a  fast food location 
the crust  and the sauce one amazing mushroom and olives and jalapeños what a combination
Definitely coming back when I'm in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Dining in or taking out the food is excellent!Just tried the chicken alfredo fettuccini tonight and that is the best pasta I have ever had! The flavor was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and the workers are super nice  the only place I would get pizza on the strip"}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food. The cashier over charged me and when I asked about the over charge he refused to explain where it came from. Instead he interrupted me in the middle of my sentence to help the next customer. My slice of cheese pizza, which was already more expensive than advertised tasted like cardboard with a slab of cheese laid on top- tasteless and dry. Definitely not worth the hassle, cost and headache it charged me. Very unhappy."}

{"text":"Pritty good pizza. They did mess up my order three times. But overall good prices and good food. Really fast at getting orders done."}
{"text":"I was walking on the strip craving for pizza, I ran into Pisa Pizza it was a great experience delicious bureaus!!  and nice service, thank you guys for a great experience"}
{"text":"I am a resident of FH and I would like to say that this is the BEST pizza in Fountain Hills! The staff is always very friendly! They always have specials for lunch and dinner! The best bang for your buck on pizza in FH!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pisa Pizza since off-campus lunch in high school... years later I've been around the block a time or two, and it is still my go to pizza joint when I am in town.  Additionally, I find myself comparing other places to Pisa Pizza when I am out and about; more often than not, PP comes out on top in my mind. 

I actively recommend this place to people when they say they are looking for a more authentic NYC pizza joint, or anyone seeking some wings.  Salads are what you would expect and other menu items are not bad... I just love the pizza crust and sauce so much, it is hard to stray.  Not too sweet, not too salty or overpowering. They have always had great lunch specials, and take-out has been consistently seamless for me.  While there is dine in seating, it's not fancy but it's certainly a comfortable enough place to plunk down amongst the NYC wall murals, and eat.  If there is an important game on, odds are good they will be playing it.

I really like the friendly family that runs/owns the joint, and they give off a \"legit pizza  place with Italian roots\" vibe that for me is a central part of the experience."}
{"text":"Pisa pizza is awesome.  Their pizza, thick or thin, is very good. Salads are very good. People are always friendly.  Best in fountain hills!! Have tried others and no one comes close. Redondo's is yucchy."}
{"text":"Pisa pizza is by far the best pizza you can get in fountain hills. They're lunch specials are great, and they always have friendly service. Whenever I'm in town, this is my me and my moms favorite place to order a pizza, and now they even deliver! If you want great pizza, this place is a gem and a locally owned business as well so support it! I know I will continue to. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"I was in vegas over the weekend and I was in the mood for some pizza so I thought I'd give this place a try. The pizza was amazing and the Stromboli is definitely a must try. Very nice folks working there. Great food, amazing service. I will definitely be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings done right! Some of the best wings I've ever had. I seriously wish there was an endless amount of them. My favorite food has to be wings by far, and this place brought emotions out of me that shouldn't be possible with food.  this is the perfect place to enjoy yourself with great quality food. They have quite the variety of food, but try those wings I'm telling you there delicious! If you want cheap cardboard pizza there a little ceasrs somewhere else. If you want good  even better wings and just good quality food this is the place!"}
{"text":"so far, not impressed. walked in, place has 1 table full of about 8 people. and  a couple people waiting for food. other then that, all the other tables are vacant, and dirty! it's not busy, why isn't it clean? i sit at a dirty table... dude says it will be 6-7 minutes and if i mind the wait... i said no. 10 minutes go by, and i only ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. you think this would be ready at lunch time, right? maybe not...so it takes longer then what he said... i get it in 15.. and it is just cheese pizza re heated up with whatever topping you want, not fresh.... but hot as hell! sauce is not very tasty, dough is very bland. the cheese was really good though, and the hint of italian herbs seasoning help the taste. The crust was nice and crisp though... i wont be back. food didn't do it for me. even if a place is dirty and unorganized, i'll still come back if the food is awesome!!! but not the case at Pisa Pizza. It's ok food with a dirty atmosphere, 2 tv's and only 1 on playing nothing interesting.... very boring nothing special, not very good service.... i'll say no more."}
{"text":"Yum! I'll definitely be back to this place!!!

So...I'm kinda weird and I'm trying this whole vegan diet thing. One of the things I struggle with giving up is pizza. I mean, you're talking to a guy who would eat pizza with like 8 different cheeses on it. Ugh. But yeah, Pisa Pizza helped me out!

When I called, the gentleman who answered the phone was very polite and accomodating to my weird request. I ordered a sicilian pizza without cheese and added fresh basil. Sounds kinda boring, right? Nah! Their crust was pretty good...it was light and crispy and not too doughy. It was cooked just right...not overdone, not underdone. The pizza sauce they use was really good too...not too garlicy and not under seasoned. The basil was fresh...I just wish there was more of it. I bet their pizza is REAL good with cheese."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. This place is overpriced and not good. We Phd $38 for 3 slices of pizza and 2 bottles of water and the pizza was one of the worst slices we've ever had. The service was terrible and they kept messing up everyone's orders. 

Go anywhere but here. Walk across the street and go to Hash House A Go Go. They're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We have been here for dinner & for wings on several occasions.  We have never been disappointed. Usually a good meal.  Big portions so we never leave hungry.  Their plain wings are our go to when we want a late night snack.

I would recommend this as a go to in Fountain Hills. For dinner & for lunch."}
{"text":"I personally believe this is the best pizza and also wings in Fountain Hills.  Now I like my wings crunchy, which is not to everyone's taste.  So if you like them big, fluffy and dripping in sauce they probably aren't going to be for you, I guess that's for each person to decide.  They have a decent Large pizza and wings combo price and I like that I can order online through Grub Hub because I hate talking in the phone."}
{"text":"Wife and I are big fans of their thin-crust cheese pizza. It's simple but tasty. Not as complex as Redendo's but that's OK; sometimes simple is good. Hot wings are sublime. Haven't tried their stromboli but it sounds intriguing."}
{"text":"ok so I like them however for some reason the top part of the pizza is always a little under done. Bottom of pizza is always cook great and crust but sometimes if you get a bite of raw dough its not the best. is there way to request the top being cooked a little longer. ?"}
{"text":"We've tried this place twice since moving to FH. The first time I ordered a deeper dish pizza, which wasn't too bad. The second time I ordered one that had a thinner, more traditional crust--it came in well below my expectations, and the drivers have always been extremely slow. I won't order from them again. 

Compared to Redendo's, PIzza Hut, and Little Caesars, this place is the most expensive. Unfortunately, I like them the least. If you're new to, or visiting, FH, I wouldn't discourage you from trying them, but I will say that there are much better alternatives...and less expensive prices in town."}
