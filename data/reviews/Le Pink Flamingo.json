{"text":"What an amazing place . So So Beautiful honestly . It reminds you of a sexy french restaurant in Paris . Our waitress Justine was so helpful with the concept and the menu . She recommended the best dishes on it . We where 6 to dine on a saturday night . The secret of the place is simple . Share your dishes with your friends . Order 4 dish per person and double up on the amazing ones , like the Mac And Cheese ( It's out of this world ) \" The Beast \" a 40oz Kosher Tomahawk steak , is the best meat i have ever eaten . ( And i have eaten in many steak houses in the world ) 

It's a Supper Club , so i would recommend you follow their Facebook Page \" https://www.facebook.com/lepinkflamingomtl/  \"to  know the nights where they have the club going . We where there on Saturday , and let me tell you, the place was like a beautiful dinner restaurant , and then the place was banging by 11;30pm . We didn't know what happened . The music was amazing and we drank up 4 bottles of champagne like we where drinking water we where having such a good time  . 

The service honestly was so welcoming and our waitress really guided us like she knew exactly what we wanted . I highly recommend this to people who like a little more out of their dinner . The food is beyond amazing . Every dish was spectacular and so so tasty . 

FOR A PLACE THAT IS NOT EVEN 3 MONTH OLD , HONESTLY I WAS BLOWN AWAY FROM THE SERVICE AND THE FOOD . REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT IT ."}
{"text":"Fun decor inside, its definitely an eye catcher if you're in the old port/ jaques cartier square! I went for a fashion event with the Montreal fashion bloggers and we had an amazing time! Friendly, personable staff. Lots of space inside, and most importantly, great food! We had a sample of many of their dishes and I loved almost every single one! Its more than just \"typical\" restaurant food, it's more gourmet and tasteful. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Cozy terrace and warm service! Just wanted to try a different place on an unpretentious afternoon during weekdays (I'm on vacations, bitch!).

The place is huuuge and is very good for groups. I didn't try their food, but... What to say of the sangria. 

Ros√© sangria made with pomegranate juice and garnished with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. 100% refreshing on a common hot Montreal day."}
