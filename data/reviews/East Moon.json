{"text":"Was very much disappointed, was waiting for 40 minutes for food that never came. Asked for a refund and left."}
{"text":"The delivery took more than an hour, when the food arrived, the beef lo mein had no flavour and no beef, maybe 2-3 pieces. The noodles just tasted like plain boiled noodles. The garlic chicken was 90% vegetables.... It was basically literally onions, carrots, green peppers, mushroom, with 2 pieces of chicken. I paid $9 for garlic chicken, but got just vegetables. I called the store and asked them to take only these 2 items that we didn't even eat (except a bite of lo mein to taste it) back and fix it or replace it, and the woman offered 10% off next $50 order. That is ridiculous, why would I order from them again if they gave me flavourless food and vegetables, and they won't even fix it? She wouldn't refund, nor fix, nor apologize for the quality of the items. I said the lo mein is plain, and she said \"I don't think so.\" She said no and refused to every and any option to fix anything and just lost a customer and got a bad review. Delivery is risky because you have to pay first. I could order $200 worth of food and she could send me just vegetables. But if I got just vegetables while dining in, I wouldn't pay $200. Outrageous."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.  Spicy crab makimono (16pc) and an side of miso soup.  All for under $12.00.  The order arrived faster than I had anticipated.  Absolutely delish.  I am honestly addicted at this current time."}
{"text":"Great chicken balls & lo mein noodles! Fast delivery (I recommend calling vs. using the online ordering system). Very professional and friendly phone reception which makes ordering so much easier. I gotta add that I was pleasantly surprised by the classy delivery service.  I've never had fast food delivered by a sweet young lady carrying a Prada bag lol... interesting. However, I have to take 2 stars off for not-so-good crispy beef, a \"pork-y\" texture & flavour to the inside of the chicken balls (batter is still great though) & below-average value meal combo's.  -#1 Egg rolls: $1.00/ea -#47 Sweet & Sour chicken balls $7.95 -Q94a Chicken Lo Mein (one of their most popular dishes, choose pork, chicken or beef) $6.75 -Q69 Crispy Beef $6.75 Grand total: $32.37  A little pricier than I prefer but we enjoyed it so it's still a nice treat and we would order from East Moon again in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been uberly disappointed yet!  FOOD The chinese food has been really tasty so far! I've had the dry garlic ribs, the beef with black been sauce and rice, shrimp with vegetables, spring rolls, wonton soup  The dry garlic ribs were so tasty but super oily. But the oil is what should be expected.  The black been sauce and beef is to die for. So good and not salty.  The shrimp with vegetables were cooked well. The vegetables were cooked but still had that nice crunch to it.  The spring rolls were good. Nothing to really rave about. The wonton soup was not that great. My wontons would break apart which seemed to me that they had been cooking for a long time. The broth was tasteless and lukewarm.  COST The cost seemed standard. However they have daily specials. Definitely go for those. You can get $1-2 bucks off such dishes.  CUTE  They have fortune cookies. But not just any type of fortune cookies. These fortunes teach you chinese! I learned \"dian (4) nao (3)\" = computer. hahaha"}
{"text":"Can I give negative stars?? The shittiest food I have ever had!! All dishes has bitter after taste and it could be because they used old oil. I don't care what they used or not, but I am NEVER EVER going here even if there is a famine in Canada. I actually fried everything again at home to make it taste better...but didn't help much. Don't go ever!  Go to McDonald's or some other cheap food place instead...it will be better than this"}
