{"text":"I travel to this area for business and came across this restaurant. I come back again and again for the delicious fare. The Caesar salad has house made dressing which reminds me of a fresh table-side version I had years ago. Lots of garlic in the mix balanced with other ingredients. Yum. Everything I have ordered is well prepared and full of flavor."}
{"text":"This family-owned Italian restaurant probably serves the most authentic Italian food in Toronto. The location is very close to many offices in Mississauga which is perfect for team lunches.   The food is very delicious and very similar to what I had in Italy. The bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is also included in the meal. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Why three stars? I found the portions extremely tiny for the price ($20-30). Also, they charge $2 for hot water (we didn't even realize until we paid for our meal)."}
{"text":"It was on a Saturday dinner around pass 6pm we came here in the middle of nowhere surrounded by industrial buildings and empty parking lots. Inside we saw an empty restaurant with only 2 patrons seems like waiting for some other guests to arrive, there was no one there to greet us, actually we made reservations for 7pm but shouldnt there be someone in the front door?  If only it wasnt Fathers Day weekend we could have walk out and find another restaurant, we waited for 5 mins, good thing someone came out to greet us and have us seated. We ordered Risotto and grilled salmon. While waiting they serve us bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I couldnt say much about the bread except it must have been a day old cold dry and on the chewy side. However the olive oil and balsamic is the high light of our meal. We asked the hostess (probably the owner) about the brand and was told it was directly imported fr Italy. The balsamic was from the 100 yrs old mother. I was just dumb structed that they serve this condiments as a complimentary meal. Risotto is excellent not too watery nor saucy, the rice is a tad over cooked then again its a matter of preferance, i could live with it and still taste really good not too creamy or buttery. The salmon is tender jucy and full of smokeiness flavor. Dinner is wothwhile will definitely come back. One of the best Italian restaurant i had without going to Italy"}
{"text":"I came here for Friday lunch with coworkers today. The restaurant is located in an industrial-type area. The interior is really nice and elegant - it was empty when we got there at 11:45am and maybe just another 10-15 people came while we were there. My manager had heard it can get pretty busy though so maybe that's moreso the case for dinner.   For 6 people, we ordered 3 servings of bruschetta (2 pieces per person) and 2 servings of calamari. Bruschetta was among the better ones I've had but in hindsight wouldn't have ordered it because the bread is the same as (or very similar to) the complimentary bread we receive. The grilled calamari was good but not easily shareable.   I ordered the Manicotti al Forno as my main (\"homemade pasta stuffed with spinach & ricotta, baked with tomato cream sauce\") - it was excellent. I didn't need a knife to cut it into pieces, the filling was delicious, and the sauce was rich.   We all had room for dessert. I had the Chocolate Ganache, it was mostly chocolate mousse with a thin cake layer on the bottom. Good, but I'll probably try their tartufo next time."}
{"text":"Very good meal, had the Italian cold antipasto for appetizer and it was on point, had the penne con pollo with rose sauce, nothing left in plate, cleaned the plate with 8 pieces of bread. Good quality Italian food!"}
{"text":"Good attentive service. Wine was good but could use more selection by the glass. Seafood was a bit over cooked."}
{"text":"Best risotto I have ever had...they staff here is great we always get what we request... their sorbets is awesome too."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant once. It was a team lunch outing a few years ago. I remember expensing the lunch, as I am the one who has the expensing account, but I don't recall the reason for being there as a team. We wanted to eat!  I recall the fancy bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to pour on our plates to dip the fresh, warm bread in it. It was good.   I had penne with chicken in tomato sauce. It was delicious, bright, and fresh. It was also a decent portion size.   My favourite dessert is tiramisu. I saw it on the menu and had to have it. It was yummy.   I felt underdressed coming here. Everyone was in business attire. Our group dresses casually on Fridays. Yes, we came here on a Friday in casual attire, including jeans and sneakers. We were welcomed with open arms and a credit card that could pay for our meals.   This restaurant is within walking distance from our office. It was pouring rain that afternoon. We stayed longer and chatted. When the rain let up a bit, we headed back to the office.   Staff are professional and helpful with their recommendations.   (43)"}
