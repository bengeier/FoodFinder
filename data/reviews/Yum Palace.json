{"text":"Yum palace friendly and nice. Great service. Food has a nice flavor. A must try. Tom yum friendly and nice. Food needs flavor and its dry. Needs alot of improvement"}
{"text":"SO SAD IT WENT OUT OF BUSINESS. I went back a couple of days ago, to find out they were closed. This was the only place my kids loved to eat at. They loved the food as much as I did. It sure was a small setting but friendly and delish. SO SAD! Finding a place like this one will be hard."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery which was prompt (with a $3 delivery fee) but that was about the only thing good. We ordered teriyaki chicken and mango chicken. For both the flavor was lacking and the sauce was very watery. The crab puffs were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. There are enough other similar restaurants in the area, that we will not likely order or eat here again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch, went in I was the only one in the place. It took a couple minutes for someone to come seat me and give me a menu, I started looking for the lunch combinations, well there are none just the regular menu, I was not going to order whole orders just for myself so I got up and left ! If you want to look at the menu on line it's not on line this place won't last 6 months!"}
{"text":"The soft shelled crab fried rice is excellent as well as the egg rolls (6 to an order)  unfortunately have been here more than twice and there is never anyone eating there so have a feeling it won't last. Very sad because food is very good. No English speaking staff doesn't help either"}
{"text":"We came her me for lunch and were the only ones in the place. I ordered the orange chicken my boyfriend ordered the mango chicken. The taste itself was not bad. The orange chicken had way to much breading and very little chicken. The sweat and sour soup was good. The egg rolls were disgusting, they were very hot on the outside and frozen in the inside."}
{"text":"Just finished eating there for the first time and was very happy with the portion of food I received. I had shrimp lo mein and was very happy.The hot & sour soup was very tasty and the spring roll was also excellent.Give the restaurant a try."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Chinese food place, as we have only been in the area about 8 months.  We won't go back to this place.  Wife ordered wor won ton soup- absolutely horrible.  There was something crunchy in the won ton- like a cracker.  Nasty.  Hubby ordered chicken & lo mein noodles- didn't eat it all and it was a very small serving for the price.  The won ton soup was expensive for the small serving.  Hate to say bad things but don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Spring rolls , hot and sour soup , mango chicken with fried rice , coconut ice cream and ginger tea!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the blandest Chinese food I have ever had in my life.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was great. Very small with a friendly staff. Thai tea was delicious! The orange chicken came out crispy and delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to say we really enjoyed this place. 
Hot and sour soup was delicious,  spring rolls were incredibly fresh and crisp,  pot stickers very flavorful and crisp. Entree of beef fried rice was excellent, kung pao chicken was different with chicken breaded but not bad. Everything tasted freshly prepared.
ldef recommend,  we will return for sure.
Beats the hell out of panda."}
{"text":"Saw that a new Chinese food place went in and wanted to give it a try. The only good point in our meal is the lady on the phone when we placed our take out order was very friendly. We got orange chicken and kung pao shrimp. By the time we got it home ( a 2 min drive) the breading on the chicken and shrimp had gotten so soggy it turned slimy and slid right off. It was unappealing and the taste was very generic.  We upgraded to fried rice which had no flavor either. Their just not doing it right from authenticity to execution. I hope they reevaluate their menu and someone starts to take pride in cooking it. They are way overpriced for the quality of food you receive.  We will not be going back which is to bad because we could really use a good Chinese food place in Surprise."}
{"text":"Horrible.   Went in and ordered green tea.  They didn't have any.  Ordered a salad.  They didn't have the cucumbers.   The place was empty besides us.  I can see why.  This place will never make it."}
{"text":"Soup egg roll and Fried rice for lunch were outstanding
Great place
I went with 3 other people who all thought the food was great"}
