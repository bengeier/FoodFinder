{"text":"Great food, great service. Conveniently located if you're working out at Westside or getting off the CTrain. However... extremely over priced! I paid 10$ for a smoothie with protein powder (and I thought 9$ at Jugo juice was a hit to the wallet!). If the price was more reasonable I would purchase a shake after every workout, but instead I will be bringing my own from now on or heading to Aspen for a cheaper way to gain back my calories."}
{"text":"The food and service here are excellent. The only problem is their portion sizes are way too small - I've ordered the rice bowl multiple times and my container is usually half empty. Given that you're paying $10, it only seems fair to expect a full container of food.  This is a gentle suggestion to the chef and owners. I would definitely come more often if my container was always full because the food is great!"}
{"text":"This is great to have. Online it has all the calorie breakdown, this gluten free, vegan and yummy. They are really friendly also and helpful. They also provide a phone number to text in your lunch order so there is no waiting...."}
{"text":"The best food there are the horse nuggets sourced from local farms with no steroids woo hoo. I could feel the mane in my teeth and I'm pretty sure I could taste hoof. I'm pretty sure this is illegal but ok I would come back if I had the heart to eat horse every day!"}
{"text":"I love this little kiosk in my gym! It's at the back left-hand corner of Westside Rec Centre, when you walk in... across from the front desk. They've got a little bit of everything - salads, pizzas, shakes, rice bowls. They're also veg/vegan-friendly. Not everything adheres, of course, but they are willing to give some suggestions (especially with shakes) and there's indications on their menu/brochure about what is vegetarian and what's vegan. 

It's fairly well-priced and they stock Vega products. I'll grab a protein bar and/or a shake on the way out after a workout when I'm on the go and know I won't have time to eat. Try the \"Go Green\" shake - the spinach sounds scary but you actually don't taste it, really!

There are also tables in case you want to take a seat. The employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"Healthfare.  That's a dumb name for a place that isn't healthy.  Nothing in the plus 15 is healthy.
What was that?  Is IS healthy?  Oh, I retract my previous statement.  But nothing healthy tastes delicious.  Oh?  It tastes delicious?  Well, they're probably slow and cost a lot.
Reasonably priced and quick?  Sheesh, good thing I don't have money on my assumptions.

Healthfare located in the BP building offers HEALTHY, delicious alternatives to the run-of-the-mill feeling-eating fast food restaurants.  The Peanut Chicken Lime stirfry is my favourite.  With fresh vegetables grilled over brown rice, this dish is about 400 calories and leaves you feeling full but not disgusting.

Colleagues of mine all piled into the Thai Express line up next door, but I wanted something I didn't have to feel guilty about afterwards.  They have combo options with sides such as soup and sweet potato wedges.  Low-fat breakfast options such as granola and oatmeal.  

You don't need Will Power to say no to bad food and yes to Healthfare, you'll crave it!  Wait, who is Will Power.. is he hot?  He sounds nice.

Pop into HealthFare, you'll be glad you did.
