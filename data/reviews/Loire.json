{"text":"perfection?  

if you're going to write a review, and tell me that it has flaws, then congratulations to you.  you should have the knowledge that they are human.  that would also reveal to some of us, that you have no knowledge of the physical workings of an actual restaurant. to be impressed with!

anyhow, for face value, \"loire\" is a restaurant on the south east corner facing west of harbord, across from a gas station.  not the most ideal visual, while peering outside of the window.  but wouldn't you know it, that some of the best restaurants are always placed where no one else will find it?  

my first experience was for a special occasion, back in the summertime, when the patio was first built and used.  the patio was new enough, that there wasn't clear guidelines as to where a good table was, or how lighting would work, as the night progressed.  my memories of that, was of an absolutely beautiful dinner.  the one thing that will always stay in my mind, was of a desert that was made especially for us, as a request to the chef (JC), because of an idea that he had initially.  the service that night could have been better (could have used at least one more experienced floor staff that night), but they were just not prepared for the amount of guests that night.  fair enough, the economy was in a bit of a rutt, but it didn't reflect the meal!

my most recent, and second visit, was this past weekend (dec 04/10), where our staff christmas dinner was held.  a table of 11 (and an early seating), allowed us to finish our meal with a bit of time left, which was perfect (considering two of the guests were late).  a few of us at the table had never had certain items on the menu, and were quite happy to try new things, and aside from oysters (which we know doesn't appeal to some people), everything else was well received.  i'm not going to get into the details of each dish, but i'll just sum it up by saying that the whole evening was fantastic.  [spinach and endive salad, trout tartare, market oysters with a maple/apple mignonette][seared sea scallop, frog leg and veal sweetbread, duck breast and confit leg, butcher block of the evening was 10 oz. rib eye, and feature of the evening was braised rabbit risotto][banana bread, hazelnut creme brule, vanilla creme brule, peanut butter and chocolate mousse]

anyhow, sure they may seem to have just a little less of minimum staff for front of house, but for the majority of the time, they worked like a well oiled machine.  easy going enough, and professional enough.  their private dining room will be finished soon.  two guys in the kitchen (in the back) doing cold foods and presumably desert, and chef with his sous, in the semi-open kitchen pumping out ALL that hot food, with good timing, and perfection.  wine list...   bah, don't worry about the wine list.  just let the owner/somellier take care of you.  for dinner, we had an unoaked ontario chard, as well as a nicely blended red from loire.  both of lower price points.

one click on their homepage, and you'll see that they state that the restaurant is \"casual gourmet\".  it's nicely presented, and beautifully prepared home cooking.  but dining also is not only the food and the atmosphere.  it has to do with your table, and who is dining with you.  remember that.

enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the ambiance was lovely and the service, while not the best I've ever had, was acceptable.  We were a chaotic group of eight, with people arriving in ones and twos over the course of an hour.  The staff took it all in stride.

It was, I believe, an owner who was serving us.  I chose a wine from Chinon, mentioning to my friends that I had spent time time there on vacation, and our server mentioned that that is where \"we\" are from, which I took to mean the proprietors.  Chinon is a small town in the Loire Valley, thus the restaurant's name.

I had chicken liver pate, which I knew would be rich, but nothing could have prepared me for the melt in your mouth beauty of this particular plate.  And it was a massive portion.  Two sort of gelato-scoop curls, which I shared with my companions.  Said companions were my husband's work colleagues, so they were shy about sharing, but the tastiness of the pate had some of them coming back for second and third tastes, propriety be damned.  Even so, some of it went uneaten it was so insanely, devlishly rich.  

My main was salmon, which was served on what looked like stir-fried rice, as in what you'd get in a cardboard container from a Chinese takeout joint.  It didn't look especially appealing but I had high hopes, expecting that a French take on fried rice might be tasty.  Alas, it was a bit boring and a bit too salty.  The salmon, however, was fabulous.  

After my pate starter I opted out of dessert but my companions raved about theirs.  

I would definitely go back, for the interesting wine list (interesting French and non-French options, interesting and non-interesting prices), wonderful food, good service and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"We celebrated an anniversary at Loire and the manager/ waiter went out of his way to make the night very special.  We shared an appetizer and each had a main, which were superb, every last bite.  The wine was incredible as it was one of the last left of an exquisite batch, and they may even hold on to the last few for us if we return!  I will definitely be back, not only because of the fond memory of the evening, but the service was great not to mention the food.  If you can afford to splurge every now and then, make Loire one to try..."}
{"text":"I'm quite in love with everything Loire has to offer.  The food was REALLY good...the charcuterie plate was amazing.  The servers were attentive and the wine was delish.  I had the fish special and I keep thinking about it a week later.  It was the perfect light mix of vegetable and fish for a hot summer evening.  The patio is lovely, an oasis.  I really don't understand the bad reviews here but reading between the lines (people asking for separate bills can occasionally be fussy; and I cannot trust the guy who starts his review with information about himself that NO BODY cares about; and don't get me started on the guy comparing it to the \"6 month mark in a relationship\"  6 months??  Ya, really long time.)
These reviews remind me to be very careful about what I read here.  Some people have no taste."}
{"text":"I went into this experience expecting more.  Maybe I should have ordered something other than the burger, but this restaurant really left me wanting.  The bread on the burger wasn't terribly thick, and the patty kept trying to slip out, and the fries tasted like they came out of a to-go bag.  
The atmosphere wasn't bad, though it was chilly as they sat us right beside the door.
The waiters were attentive and then inattentive and then attentive again. It was difficult to get our portion of the bill (two out of a group of six), but it seemed like we were putting them out, even though I was clear on what we had ordered.   The food ordered by the other people in our party was generally met with approval, though the soup tasted sort of grocery storeish."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 
Quality 4/5
Atmosphere 3/5
Comfortability 5/5
Presentation 5/5
Service 5/5
We spent over $100 per person because we weren't holding back. Your probably going to spend at least $50 a person for dinner and a drink.

Patio yes, good for dates or groups. Friendly chef and server. Food is great. No one was smoking on the patio, that was nice. I am not sure they allow smoking.

Place could use music on the patio and longer canopy for when it rains but some tables still possible to sit under when it rains.

Lobster bisque is amazing, quite buttery. The sourdough bread comes warm, very good. The sea scallops and ox tail wasen't really what I was expecting but was very good. Did have quite a pickled taste but one of us doesn't like pickled and loved the dish all the while. Portions aren't huge but for 2 - 3 courses you leave very full because dishes are quality and rich."}
{"text":"It's comparable to a 6 month mark of a relationship. Comfortable. Relaxing. Will still surprise you from time-to-time, but for better or worse, it's missing that initial sense of uncertainty and excitement.

+ For the homely feel. 
+The menu is a concentrated collection of relatively simple dishes with local ingredients 
+ wallet friendly.

- The close proximity of the other tables makes this a tough place for a date.
-Charcuterie plate was a bit of a disaster. 

Recommend:  Seared Sea Scallops. Lamb burger.

Reservations: 24hrs recommended. 

The Damage: ~$45pp, pre-tax,tip,drinks.

Extra-tidbit: Our waiter mentioned that the menu changes quite a bit month over month based on what's in season."}
{"text":"Pricey, but quite tasty.  Went with coworkers, for some reason we were the only people there, but the food was victory.  Victory, I tell you."}
{"text":"delicious appetizers: steak tartare was very balanced, and beet salad was perfectly assembled and had a certain flare that set it apart from the typical been salad.

mains were excellent:  scallops and oxtail for my SO was intriguing and perfectly cooked, and I had the beef tenderloin, which on paper may sound uninspired but  was perfectly executed.

even better than the food was our server, who knew every ingredient in every dish and was able to describe every dish in exquisite, mouth-watering detail.  best server I've had in a looong time.  even the kid who was bussing our table seemed to know about wine and food.  

this resto is not be as hip as it once was, and no, it's not on ossington or dundas west, but it serves excellent food in a fairly simple, modern atmosphere.  and it was a pleasant surprise not to hear a soundtrack of random mp3s of all the indie rock darlings playing in the background, as is all too common in many restaurants.   

looking forward to going back.  both my SO and I agreed it was one of the best meals we've had in the past year or more."}
{"text":"Excellent French cuisine, great atmosphere.  Unfortunately our waiter was MIA most of the evening.  We chased him down multiple times. It'd be worth the trip again just for the Risotto and Pork belly.  Fingers crossed for better wait staff."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend on a rainy day. I think i ordered the frog legs and scollops. The food was ok, but I remember there was sand in one scollop, others were good, and the frog legs and scollops were quite fresh. They were pretty full that day. I think both food and decoration can be improved."}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to apologize to my readers about my extended absence.  I'm afraid I was away from communication due to my vacation and subsequent imprisonment.  It was all to do with a misunderstanding between myself and a young lady, who happened to be the preferred 'woman of the night' of the captain of the merchant ship on which I had booked passage to The Gambia.  A simple vacation turned into a ghastly experience--my saving grace was the little mute cabin boy who bailed me out of that African gaol with no more than a wink and a quart of whiskey.  Thank the Queen of England that that unpleasantness was over with!

Getting on with the review; I dined at Loire the other night.  Now, I don't expect every single dining experience to mirror the service I received during my time in the east; the Oberon, the Taj, the Orient, all designed to make one feel as an honoured guest, with one servant to fill the water, one to take the order, one to push in my chair and one to fetch me a selection of fine cigars from around the world.  Service to me is a boy offering to get me a taxi, make reservations, having an enemy 'taken care of'.  But alas, those days have passed us by.  The fellows at Loire have taken that one step further!  During my luncheon there we were amazed at the business of the room and the lack of servers.  One waiter for the whole bloody room?  The owner sweately opening bottles of wine for disgruntled suits?  What has dining come to?

But we must be forgiving, I always say, perhaps this is their first restaurant, perhaps they are french, so we went again. 

This time for dinner, it was, if anything, worse.  On a Wednesday night a full room was being served by the same two, and while professional, (and the food quite good) we felt that the servers wanted nothing more than to move on to the next table.  Never before have I had to pour my own water and wine! An Outrage I say!  I tried to remind them who I was, but astoundingly they had never heard the moniker \"Horace B. Mayweather\" and proceeded to scoff.  Yes.  Scoff.  

So, friends, please find a restaurant which cares about its service (see my other reviews for examples) and give this one a wide berth.

I am off to take the orient express (or what is left of it) to Tehran which, I understand is no longer under British control, for a relaxing holiday.  I am just waiting on my rail confirmations and a letter from my doctor attesting to my alcoholism and therefore allowing me to drink in this 'dry' country. 

Cheerio!

{"text":"Saturday night, great fall evening, a reservation at Loire, what could go wrong ? 

Everything. First we were greeted with \"How long are you going to be?\" by a truly embarrassed Maître D'. When we asked our waiter /manager why we had been greeted with such an offensive question, we were scolded for being 20 minutes late - we had been courteous and called beforehand - and how difficult it is to manage two seatings ... 

Needless to say we left, after our drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a Summerlicious 3 course prix-fix.  The extra appetizers and wine which we ordered on top of the 3 Summerlicious courses were phenomenal.  The waiter was a fantastic sommelier and the wine was delicious.  However, the rest of the food (prix-fix courses) was very disappointing.  The appetizers and mains were just ok and the desserts were absolutely horrible; oversized and barely edible.  The creme brûlée tasted as if it was made two days before.  If it weren't for the fabulous wine, we would have wasted our money.  I have a feeling that they put less effort into the Summerlicious deals than they would normally."}
{"text":"I took my SO out to Loire for his birthday.  We had a WagJag deal coupon for our meal.  Loire is located on the ritzy Harbord street avenue with other fancy restaurant.  I love the fact that the restaurant stands out with its white painted exterior.

Food

A couple sitting beside us recommended that we order the oysters as an appetizer because they are always fresh and delicious at Loire.  Their recommendation was right; 6 oysters for $19 was also a pretty great deal.  Our second appetizer was their Salmon Salad (I might be incorrect on the name), it was sashmi style salmon with caviar and greens.  It was refreshing and light.  I could have eaten more.

We both order seafood dishes - my SO got the Mussels dish and I ordered the Catch of the day.  When we got our meal, we were taken back by the portions.  Most fine dining places give you tiny portions.  I really enjoyed my catch of the day, which was trout.  It was cooked to perfection and I loved the vegetable medley that accompanied my dish.  My SO was engrossed in his meal, he loved the fact that there was rice at the bottom of the mussel broth.

We did not get desserts during this visit.

Service

Great and attentive, we completed our meal in under an hour!

Atmosphere

I was expecting a more romantic setting, it is cozy but the lights are really bright in the restaurant.

Overall

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a more hearty French meal with a fine dining elements."}
{"text":"Rich, welcoming french food. A knowledgeable and friendly staff along with one of the best selections of apps in the city makes this a great place. Went with the whole family, so many age groups and had a wonderful time. Without a reservation we got a table quickly and had wine in hand in the blink of an eye. We had all the apps, and certainly the trout tartare did stand out, as did the pork belly. But it was the lamb that made my night so complete. Succulent and fresh, a real treat. We all had a wonderful time and return often."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, excellent service.

I came here since I got a deal from Groupon. We arrived early for our reservation, and were the first people in the place, meaning we got our pick of the tables. We decided to sit on their very very awesome patio. The patio is partially obscured from the street with horizontal slats of wood, which manage to make the place feel separated from the busy street, without being obscured from it. It felt very intimate and lovely. It was the perfect spot for a romantic date.

Our server was just amazing the entire time. He was there when we needed him, gone when we didn't, and did all the fine-dining stuff right (pouring wine with the label towards you, all that jazz). 

The food was good, but didn't blow our minds. I loved the rainbow trout tartare appetizer, the sugared lemon rinds were particularly fantastic in this dish, as they gave a nice pop of sweet and lemony flavour. The Hubster had the lamb burger and frites, which he enjoyed. The frites were perfectly crisped and salted. I could have eaten a truckload of them. I had the duck, which was pretty good. The slaw under it was a little too vinegary and kind of distracted from the flavour of the duck.

All in all, it was a really pleasant dining experience, but we thought it was a tad overpriced. It was good, but I don't think we'll be rushing to return again.

Oh, and although there's a reservation function on the page, I recommend calling in the off-hours to make your reservation. That way you get to hear the outgoing messaging which is the owner speaking in an OUTRAGEOUS French accent (much like the French in Monty Python's Holy Grail). Somehow he manages to make \"Loire\" a 15-syllable word, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. With all the other high end restaurants in Toronto, I can't imagine why anyone would return to this restaurant. Even with a Groupon I feel like I was ripped off. I ordered the fish entree which literally needed to be three times larger to be a regular sized entree. My sister ordered the lamb burger, which was slightly better portioned and quite delicious. 

The banana bread that we had for dessert was plain and reminded me of something from Starbucks--not bad, but definitely not worth $10. 

I'm torn on my opinion of the service. Our server was a middle-aged pompous man who kept calling us \"girls\". Yeah, we're not 8. Thanks. He was generally attentive enough, but he also kept trying to pressure us to order off the wine list, which we didn't want to. There was another server (a young, very attractive man from France). He was very down-to-earth and for a few minutes he ironically made us forget that we were in a snooty French restaurant."}
{"text":"Loire's exactly what it looks like - a little french restaurant on Harbord. The food is done well, the menu rotates regularly, I've never been disappointed.

The service is often handled by one of the owners (French, from the Loire valley, hence... quite) and he is clearly just dying for you to engage so that he can tell you more about the menu and help you find the right dish. My advice is to roll with it. He remembered me as a regular on my second visit - clearly he cares.

Great wine list and with all due respect to my co-reviewer Whiskey L down there, I've really enjoyed their charcuterie.

Not 5 stars because the service can struggle when it's crowded, the tables are sort of packed in (ambiance!), and because I haven't been blown out of the water there. But I've absolutely never been disappointed - this isn't a 5-star that sometimes tanks and gets a 2 in my book, averaging down - this is an utterly reliable 4-star hookup."}
{"text":"Arriving at Loire, we were greeted quite quickly and visited by our waiter soon after as well.      We were brought 4 thinly sliced portions of french baguette and butter.  I looked around... the decor was average.  We were seated quite close to other tables... typical fine dining Toronto, not of which I'm a fan.  The rectangular room was well lit, with help from the large street front window.

We started with the Rainbow Trout tartare... and it was quite tasty.  We were off to a good start.

We were earlier informed of the specials, one of which appealed: the sea bass, atop vegetables and eggplant puree.  I ordered the pasta, which was actually recommended to me by my seated neighbour, though I'd already decided on it as it looked incredibly delicious:  

Truffle & Honey Glazed Chicken Pasta
Fresh Tagliatelle, Roasted Cashew Pesto
Crisp Spring vegetable & Parmesan Cheese

When the food arrived, it was hot and looked appetizing.  Yet, when I poked around, I first thought I would have appreciated more than a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  Then I poked further and actually became angry at the lack of ingredients within this $25 pasta.  There was literally a half of a baby tomato, two tiny pieces of chicken totalling the size of not even a chicken nugget... and all the flavour still to be desired.

The waiter took a while to attend to ask how the food was... the restaurant became busy.  I called him over and requested the sea bass special and explained my reasoning.  I sat and watched my girlfriend finish her meal and began scarfing mine as soon as she had finished.  I think I was hangry.  You know, angry because you're hungry?  Anyway... that course was better... but I still question the price of the plate at $27.   I still smiled and told the staff it was good though.

The waiter later asked if anything on the dessert menu interested us.  I 
cleverly said that the Warm Banana Bread (which had Candied Pecan, Dark Chocolate Caramel Sauce, Vanilla Ice Cream: interested us; cleverly I think, because technically, I didn't order it.  Gladly, it wasn't on the bill either!  The waiter also had asked if we would like some dessert wine, on the house, and we obliged.  It was a nice gesture.

I went to Loire because they offered a Groupon deal... I think this actually justified the overall meal and experience... especially the prices of the food.  I'm not sure I'd go back with so many other places to try; though, I was grateful that the waiters made good on what could have been a much worse experience."}
{"text":"Checked out Loire last night for the first time and am glad to say it was a really nice experience (especially since it's just around the corner from home). 

We had a dealicious voucher, purchased for $70, which was a prix fixe with choice between two apps, two mains, and two desserts. It also included one drink (white or red wine, kir royale) each. Seemed reasonably good for $35 apiece. We sat outside on the patio, which was about 2/3 full on a Thursday night. Service was very friendly and relaxed.

They also brought out a small amuse bouche which consisted of crostini, fois gras, and a beet sauce (?) of some kind. 

Apps: watermelon soup (gazpacho?) spicy and refreshing, especially with this heat
salad with endive and goat cheese - pretty basic

Mains: fried fish with fennel, tomato, salsa verde - pretty basic also but tasty and a good portion
steak frites - the frites weren't the usual small frites you would think of, but the steak was very good and cooked just as ordered (rare side of medium rare)
both of these are on the main menu as well

Dessert: we both had the lychee creme brulee. I didn't detect a lot of lychee but it was good.

Drinks: 1 glass each of kir royale, white wine (viognier, not on the menu but you can ask for it), red wine (syrah-grenache), calvados, tawny port

Total cost, including voucher, tax, and tip, was $140 for two people.

Overall: food was good, if not amazing, service was friendly and pleasant, the patio was nice. Overall a really nice experience. I think I'll buy a couple more of those vouchers, but I'd also like to return to try the rest of the menu (especially since it's in the neighbourhood)."}
{"text":"This place is apparently CLOSED. the website, facebook page etc all give no indication of this of course, but if you call the number the line has been disconnected. we learned this after, despite emailing in a  reservation to their still functioning and presumably active website and making the trek there, that it is in fact closed. we arrived at 6:15 on a saturday to a place that is supposed to be open at 5:30 and it was closed, no one was around. Don't bother making this same mistake, because this establishment is gone and the management hasn't bothered to make any such indication through any available medium."}
{"text":"I cant believe this place hasn't received better reviews! 
The atmosphere was great, the food was great, the sommelier  was amazing. He recommended a chinon which is now my favorite wine. 
Save room for the cheese plate, it was one of the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Loire is one of the restaurants on Harbord Street that drew us choose our neighborhood to live in.  Before we ever ate there, it seemed like a restaurant I would really enjoy with great food, wine, service, and atmosphere but an unpretentious attitude (what my husband would call a \"good vibe\").  After two visits now I can say it competes with our favorite restaurants from New York on all of these fronts.  Both times we've been there the employees have been knowledgeable and attentive, and everything we ate was presented beautifully.  In the summer the terrace is fantastic.  

Prices are pretty comparable to similar restaurants here and in New York.  The dining room is small, which adds to the cozy feel but could make it difficult to get in when the patio, which doubles the size of the restaurant, is not open.  The food is fantastically fresh and flavorful and adjusted to use local and seasonal ingredients - which as you'll see is a huge draw for me.  I'd definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm from the states but will definitely be going back soon!  The food was absolutely delicious!  Very intimate and the wait staff was excellent.  Our server who also turned out to be the manager answered all of our questions and was super nice.  I guess it helped that he was also really cute..."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto, my home away from home, and we decided to walk down to Harbord Street and randomly select a restaurant with a nice terrace.

That led us to Loire.  Unfortunately, the terrace was the highlight of the meal. To make a long story short, the food was incredibly average AND extremely expensive.

It would have been OK had our party of five spent $200, but it was twice that.

There's so many nice places on Harbord, but this ain't one of them.
Beware!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a fantastic meal. Very authentic French bistro with great food, a calm and low key atmosphere and good service. The wine list features all the heavy hitters from various regions in France, but also has some great variety from the Loire valley. Overall, a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Nice and decent place. 

The food is good, maybe even great....
Everything is rich in flavor (as you would expect from French), you can see the complexity...but there's this thing just missing, almost maybe love.

I went with 7 people so i got to try a lot. Their trout tartare was the star of the all appetizers. The goat cheese cheesecake was unique and i'm fully copying this to make at home. The charcuterie platter was ok, not the best i've had, but good. Other appetizers didn't blow me away.
In terms of dinner, the butchers block was veal. Good amazing. I though the duck breast and leg confit was good, and surprisingly, the lamb burger was not too shabby at all. I thought the sweetbread shrimp dish was a little too many flavours clashing, and the taglietelle was bland. 
In terms of dessert, the hazlenut creme brulee was so simple yet unique, i loved it. Again, something i will make in the future.
The warm bread pudding with icecream and dark chocolate caramel was not bad at all.

Overall, i was impressed with the food. The service was slow but 'french' and fun (waiter made many arab jokes at my table, but in good faith) and the atmosphere/ambience of the place is quite nice. 

I think Loire is definitely good food (better than Tati across the street) but it feels almost like the 'cooks' may just be a little young."}
{"text":"I hosted my birthday party at Loire July 26, 2014.  We made the reservation a month in advance since was it is bigger party and wanted the restaurant to be properly prepared.  The evening was a bust thanks to the worst service I have ever experienced. 

Service issues we had during my evening at this restaurant:

1) They failed to properly staff the restaurant for our party.  We had 1 young waiter serving us and he was great but there just wasn't enough staff to serve 33 people.  People started arriving at 7:30 and we did not start eating our appetizer until 9.  

2) They did not bring out any bread until 9pm AFTER we asked and they only served to the people who asked until we told them it was for the table.  

3) My guests wanted to buy drinks at the bar but were asked to sit down as they were serving food and required everyone to be seated - they couldn't serve the remaining 29 people seated?  One of my guests wanted to buy a bottle and he would not allow.  He would rather charge a premium per shot for the evening.

4) Most of my guests left before the dessert came out since it was 11:30pm and they could no longer stay out.  I did not even get a dessert and I was evidently there until the end of the night!

5) The stunner of the night hasn't even surfaced at this point. When we got our bill, there was an additional cost for a mystery person.  We counted the chairs, the people, and the guest list and it conflicted with his count.  The owner would not even entertain the objective facts presented to him and continues to say that because he took the orders, they were what  he was charging us.  So the last time I checked, customers did not pay for your mistakes. We paid for his mistake and tried to get on with my birthday.  But to further the frustration...

6) His lack of professional manner was beyond patronizing.  I have been in customer service for 10+ years and never have I met someone so ignorant to customer service.  When we disagreed with the bill, he ranted to me about two guests who did not give minimum gratuities (everyone else paid a set prix calculated before dinner started with 18% added). It is standard practice to include 18% with parties greater than 6, so this is really not my problem if you failed to include in their bill.  Take it up with those patrons.  More so, he had the audacity to sarcastically wish me happy birthday on the way out.  

The food, on the other hand was beautifully crafted and the chef was a delight.  Our waiter did the best he could to wait on a such a large group on his own.t  Evidently the operations of the establishment was less than average and you can most definitely find another restaurant at these price points if you want a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I hosted my company's Staff Party at Loire on a Sunday evening and I was completely blown away! The canapes were fantastic and everyone loved them. They even went out of their way to make signature cocktails for us during the reception. We then sat down and enjoyed a four course meal. Each plate was better than the last! The Chef came out after each dish was placed to explain what we were eating, as well as explaining why the wine we were being served would pair well with the dishes. I couldn't have been happier with how things turned out and I only heard fantastic things about the food from the rest of the staff."}
