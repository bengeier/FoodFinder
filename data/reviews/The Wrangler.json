{"text":"OMGosh what have they done to me?  This revamp is amazing.  When a group of friends said we were eating here I said no.  I am so glad I was outvoted.  Previously this place was dirty and the food was bland.  No anymore!  The service was fabulous and friendly.  The food was amazing.  Our group of 8 didn't have to wait forever for our food and our drink glasses never ran empty.  My steak was juicy and cooked properly.  This will be a place to come to over and over."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I had been hearing about the new steakhouse at the silver nugget by I was not expecting that. I was so impressed and so was everyone in our group.  The portions sizes were huge, the steaks were amazing and the service was even better.  Best off strip steakhouse in vegas and the price makes it that much better.   Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The revamp of this place is great! Definitely a huge improvement on the decor.  The food is also pretty good and especially considering the price. But it was the service that definitely earned this place the 4th star.  I had the Philly cheese steak (no peppers or onions by choice) and fries which was recommended by our server, Ruth. My bf had The Cowgirl ribeye (10 oz) which came with a house salad, side of rice, cowboy beans, and corn bread. Everything was great! Definitely a place you want to check out. Especially during the happy hour (5 pm - 7 pm) at the casino bars (2 for 1 drinks)."}
{"text":"We have become fans of the new and revamped Wrangler steak house. It has become a regular breakfast spot a couple days a weeks. They have some great breakfast specials for under $5 and some even include coffee.  The service is top notch and very attentive. We have tried a lot of menu items and even the $5.99 prime rib which is served after 11am every day. They also have some new AYCE specials but we have not tried them yet. One is popcorn shrimp on mondays.  Portion sizes are large.  Back to breakfast. Nearly all breakfast comes with an oatmeal or biscuit and gravy option.  Great home fries with all the veggie goodies mixed in. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"First they don't separate checks. Second the female workers there are rude and just talk."}
{"text":"Good food, great service and good prices. The Wrangler not only has the best prices in ALL of North Las Vegas. Way better than Jerry's Nugget and Poker Palace. The food speaks for itself that will keep you coming back."}
