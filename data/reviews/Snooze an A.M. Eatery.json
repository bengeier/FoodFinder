{"text":"It's hard to pick which is better the food, the drinks or the service! Everything on the menu far exceeds expectations and the staff is by far the friendliest in town. Guaranteed you'll leave satisfied, happy and feeling great!"}
{"text":"Chili verde pork eggs Benedict was superb, as was the service. I love good music in an eatery, however, don't know if we will be back. The music was so loud that we found ourselves (all 4 of us) yelling at each other in order to have a conversation. Mentioned it when we arrived and they offered outside seating, which didn't help. Someone else must have complained bc just as we were checking out the music was turned down so that you could chat."}
{"text":"Updating.  Management contacted us about our problems.  We have been back several times and service is much better.


Worst Snooze. Inattentive slow staff.  Food is good but diner shouldn't have to retrieve their own cream.  Better to drive few miles for better service."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good breakfast foods! But today I went in with a friend of mine and our server had the worst attitude! She didn't introduce herself and she had this look on her face like she didn't want to be there. She also took my ketchup when I wasn't even done with it to top it off she didn't even ask if she can take it she just reached right over my face WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME and took it then walked away. How rude. While I was eating NOT EVEM DONE she starts taking my plate and I was like I'm not even done. Like wow she really wanted us gone! I really hope you guys address this problem. If she has poor customer service skills she shouldn't be working at a place like this!! Her name was Kayla by the way!"}
{"text":"I would actually give 3 1/2 if possible.

Where to start? Ok, cool vibe, modern and comfy. Very hipster. So far great.

I sat at the bar- they were attentive. Brought my coffee quickly.  Uh oh.. one sip and I was transported to Denny's- and not the best Denny's either. WTF? I can't remember having such a bad cup of coffee at any real restaurant. It was very weak and bitterish. Like my mom and dads favorite Folgers! Ugh.

And this my friends is the main reason for the lower rating. It's a BREAKFAST restaurant!  If I hadn't already had a cup earlier I would have had to stop somewhere.  And I'm not a Starbucks addict type. 

I chose a diff differently type dish: breakfast pot pie.  It was creative and pretty good!  The pastry part of the meal scored a 4.5. The hash browns were well. cooked but absolutely bland as hell.  2.5 for them.

Service was fairly good- getting to good towards the end.

I'm undecided on if I'd go back- mainly because it's BREAKFAST, and I want coffee.

I just may though, I'll just be sure  to get my octane before I go.

I'd say give it a try- but beware the coffee!"}
{"text":"I was just in the area so I decided to stop for A bite. I have heard really good things about this place but I didn't think it was as good as the things I've heard. It was a very cool set up with many booths and tables with chairs. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a seat with the place being pretty full, mine as well we had 8 in our party. Snooze has a really great menu and many choices to choose from, and also have some unique flavors for pancakes. I got a green Chile burrito with black beans, egg,And cheese. It was a good burrito but my one downside is that the burrito was pretty cold, and everything inside of it was cold too. We also got pumpkin pancakes, a sausage biscuit type thing, and French toast. These were all very good. The service was also Good. If you were to want to go somewhere for a quick breakfast place I would recommend it"}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch here today and had the good fortune of having Hyatt (yes, like the hotel chain) as our server. She was delightful!! Be sure to ask for her when you arrive. She was friendly, efficient and full of life and positive vibes. Try the eggs Benedict or breakfast burrito. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great environment, excellent service!  We were visiting in the area. Wish we had one in our home state."}
{"text":"First the good.  The menu is outrageous with lots of yummy choices! All brunch places should have mimosas and this one has practically a full bar!  The Eggs Benedict is outstanding! It was perfectly cooked and the  Best I have ever had at a restaurant, and I am hard to please on this dish.. The coffee is also very flavorful.
Now, the less good. Tuesday morning 11:00 and it still took over 1/2 hour to get our food.
The coffee took  over 10 minutes. The noise level inside the restaurant was high. 
 And now the real  disappointment. I tried a side of pancake. I consider myself a pancake aficionado. The pancake was woefully  Under cooked and very doughy, no light and fluffy about it: inedible. Too bad customer service was not on this issue.  I wasn't offered  another pancake  after I showed them or an adjustment on the bill.  In fact, the waitress didn't seem to care.
So, don't expect fast service, avoid the pancakes, and ask for quick coffee.
I will go back and try again, in case they improve with the feedback I see they are getting."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times. Every time without fail the egg offerings come out at near room temperature (cold). It seems as if they cook eggs first, and leave them on the plate to cool while they cook the rest. The food is usually tasty, but always cold. They have a problem with timing."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is Great..the food was better. I went with the Shrimp and grits. It came with this extra oil which I could have done without, the shrimp had the best flavor. I would have preferred my andouille sausage to be sliced versus crumbled. All in all the portions were amazing I couldn't even finish it.. if you're from the south the grits will throw you off (like they did me)..they were a consistency of mashed potatoes..I would definitely go back to try something different!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend, and Hyatt was our server.  First, Hyatt is absolutely awesome!  She is attentive, caring, efficient, and really knows the menu and what to suggest!  She also asked us about allergies, and since I have a major allergy, I really appreciated it!  Thank You, Hyatt, for making my day!  Second, the food is AMAZING!  I had the Benedict Duo, and loved every bite.  The food was hot, fresh, expertly plated, and portion sizes were perfect.  I will definitely be returning to this restaurant.  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait to get in (and they have a great texting service that lets you wander around nearby shops while you wait). The staff is incredibly attentive and quick but it never seems rushed. The food was excellent -- I got the Benedict duo (bella bella benny and chili verde), both of which were wonderful. The hash browns were divine and make sure whatever you get comes with a side of hash browns. Huge high recommendation. The menu was very varied and I wanted to try a million things. Absolutely will make a return trip."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the food at 3 of their locations now and haven't been disappointed!  Most recently I tried the Benny Goodman since I adore Benedict's. I absolutely loved it!  Two poached eggs were served on toasted dark rye with lox & a sun dried tomato and caper relish, this was one of the most unique Benedict dishes I've tasted so far. Hollandaise included cream cheese so perfectly enhanced the lox. The entree is completed by hash browns which were beautifully crisp on the outside.  Loved sitting on the patio ... no on a weekday morning."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for now. Finally hit up Snooze at their new location in Ahwatukee and had an okay experience. Food was pretty good but the service I received felt fake and passive aggressive.

I ordered the breakfast burrito which had good flavors but wasn't served hot enough for my liking. The middle was just barely warm which took away from the flavors a bit. It comes with no meat by default (other than eggs of course), and costs about $2 to add a protein of your choice.

With a ton of boozy brunch drinks and creative dishes available, Snooze is a decent spot for basic brunching. However, after my experience with the literally lukewarm food and service, not sure if I'd be back again too soon."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot got even better today. 
Sydney waited on us and she is the best waitress EVER.  Got our order spot on and repeated it all back.  Was very attentive checking in on us the right number of times. Very helpful with everything we requested, and made the whole experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch since it is not open evenings and has no lunch items to speak of on menu
We waited 30 for a table
Place is well decorated lively and a sort of 50s theme
Clean and service is very friendly
They are very willing to cater to your food needs and make changes to menu items
Staff knows the food and menus very well
Food was beautifully presented and delicious 
Would definitely come again!
Maybe for the French toast with caramel sauce and berries as a sweet treat early afternoon!"}
{"text":"Do not go here for breakfast. Their kitchen has messed up my order consistently the last four times I have eaten here. It takes 50 minutes to get food that isn't what you ordered to then wait for them to remake it for you. Yes they remade them for me, however now my fiance has to eat cold eggs. Don't waste your time with this joint that takes an hour to do a to-go order incorrectly, I won't be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast choices. Not just the normal breakfast menu. Very creative meals. Very nice outdoor eating environment. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Snooze (hubby had checked it out previously) and it was absolutely delicious!! We were drawn to this place because it's based in our home state of Colorado and the menu looked great. Although we dined on a very busy spring Sunday morning (yay for patios in Arizona!), the food could not have been better. I had the seasonal dish called, \"I like You E'Lote Benedict,\" which is described as Elote corn quinoa cakes topped with poached (I had scrambled instead) cage free eggs, chili lime hollandaise, cotija cheese and roasted corn salsa, and I think it's the best breakfast dish I've ever had. Seriously. You need to try this place. It's awesome."}
{"text":"This location is not quite up to par with others in the area. My friend and I both ordered bacon, and were asked if we wanted it crispy. We both responded \"yes,\" but hers came out burnt and mine was undercooked and greasy. It's a breakfast restaurant, so good bacon is something I would expect. I'll continue to go to the Snooze locations in Tempe and Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is s must for brunch when visiting PHX/Scottsdale/Tempe.  It's your classic upscale diner.  Really known for their Benedict's and Pancakes.  Benedict's are high quality and the presentation is nice.    They allow you to sub your sides for a sweet dish.  

They are also an ethical restaurant.  A lot of locally sourced ingredients.  Plus they support a lot of nonprofits and charities.  

Note there are long waits during weekends, which isn't abnormal for any good brunch spot in America.   However, this place is horrible at turning tables over.  You will be waiting for a table and will notice at least 5 or tables that no one is sitting at.  On the bright side at least they give you free coffee while you wait.  If you are short on time this isn't the place to go.  

Bathrooms are clean, so that's a good sign that the kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"Like we've come to expect from Snooze, the food is always good and the choices interesting.

However, unlike the Tempe location, their histesseshave no clue what they are doing. We've been there twice, been told that the wait would be between 30-40 minutes and then waited an hour before being seated. Each time, they either \"lost\" or place in the queue or wrote down the wrong number. We're fine with a longer wait, but at least be realistic about the time, or be organized enough to adhere to your own time frames. 

Both times, we were told that we were \"next\" and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes as others were seated before us. And, they never actually apologized for any of this. 

Until they fix their front desk, we will make the drive elsewhere for breakfast. No food is worth that kind of wait and treatment."}
{"text":"The food and menu are good. So far, I have had the Steak and eggs benny and the corned beef hash. I am disappointed in the service. From sitting to finally being served food on my last visit was over 1 hr. We sat outside and the servers were hardly to be seen. When possible, I had to flag them down for water. 

I hope other people have a better experience than what my family and I had.

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"A fantastic addition to Ahwatukee!  My kids beg to be taken here for the \"OMG french toast\" or the blueberry pancakes.  I like the thick bacon and locally sourced ingredients.  Food and service are excellent and a nice location. They even have breakfast and lunch cocktails that I will have to try someday when I'm not driving.  The prices are not bad at all.  I love the fun decorating."}
{"text":"Breakfast potpie very unique and super delicious. And the sweet potato pancakes are to die for"}
{"text":"My friend Katie and I came here for a well deserved brunch after hiking South Mountain with our two puppies. I love that their patio is huge and so dog friendly! Our server was super attentive and immediately brought out bowls of cold water for our spoiled little fur babies, which was a huge plus. I started with the Mountain Mule - gin, grapefruit, ginger beer, lime and agave - which was refreshing and delicious. I absolutely LOVED the I Like You E'Lote Benedict. Instead of english muffins, they came on these amazing sweet corn and quinoa cakes and were topped with chili lime hollandaise. You can't really go wrong with any of their bennys, though, and if you're REALLY indecisive there's the option of getting a benny duo. The hash browns here are just meh... but you can upgrade to one of their signature pancakes for only $4. My favorites are the sweet potato pancakes with caramel and candied pecans, and the blueberry danish pancakes which come with the most amazing lemon cream cheese filling. For those of you looking for something seriously decadent to fill your cheat day, you can also get a flight of 3 pancakes. You're welcome."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a Snooze breakfast! Unless half your breakfast doesn't show up until everyone you're spending your Sunday Brunch with is done eating! Only saw our waitress when she took our order. I understand it's busy but when we asked about the rest of the order she's says \"oh yeah\". Doesn't apologize. Doesn't even try to speed up getting the order out. It was one pancake. Nothing special, just one. 
Four stars are definitely for the food only. Customer service was a solid 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"So the food was good.  Unfortunately, it stops there--this is where the 3 stars come from.  Considering people have been raving about this place, I really expected good food, good service, and a great environment.  The food was good.  I had the pancake flight and ..well, genius--I loved the variety.

Now, admittedly we walked in having all crawled out of bed on the holiday today.  Fortunately, we didn't have a wait and we were seated right away since it was about an hour before closing.  Unlike my motley group, our server Sydni was very presentable.  Unfortunately, she was also somewhat inattentive, forgetful, and a little awkward (e.g. I asked about getting some syrup for my pancakes and she replied \"not normally\"...she did bring it, but she forgot for the first while and I was already 1/3 done my food once it arrived...she asked us early on if we wanted ketchup and hot sauce and we said \"yes\" but then she never brought them...)  

Now here's what seals the deal on us not returning--two issues here.  Firstly--When we came in, the music was so loud it was actually uncomfortable.  We were seated next to a large group of ~10 people, including kids, and between the table next to us and the music...we couldn't actually hear one another speaking.  People in the restaurant were clearly all competing with the music and it really escalated the noise level in there.  Secondly--the drinks here are problematic.  My daughter asked about getting Sprite and was told that they don't have any but they do have a Mexican version.  Ok--she didn't want that so she said \"can I just get a Coke then?\"  She was brought the Mexican version still and didn't like it--she barely even took a sip out of it.  Then, I asked for a diet Coke and was brought a cup full of ice with about 30ml of soda poured over it to generate some watery tasteless liquid.  Three sips and it was gone.  Refill was much the same--another three sips.  When I asked for a third, I was told I would be charged again.  So I paid $5 for about 100-120ml of watered down generic soda.  In a world of free refills...this has me eating at the competition.  Further, Sydni needed some prompting on providing us straws.  Oh and the water refills?  You'd think she was paying out of pocket for the water--those cups sat empty for most of our meal.

So Snooze...between the soda situation, the noise, and poor service...I'm headed back to my regular breakfast haunt up on Elliott near Priest.  You know the one.  When you start to hire based on experience and ability, resolve the refill issue (or at least stop padding your drinks with all ice), and turn down the music...let me know, because your food is genuinely good and I really want to like you."}
{"text":"We waited for 2 hours to eat.  (Party of 2).  It was a Saturday at 11am.  The food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  People who came after us were sat before us.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh sahhh  dude !!! The pineapple upside down pancakes are to die for!!! Thanks for the awesome breakfast and I'm sure I'll be back for cakes and caps in a hop, skip, and a jump!!!"}
{"text":"Menu is great with tons of variety and food was good. They can improve the hashbrowns, they were good but bland. Coffee was disappointing, we tried the Latte and a cold brew, both were mediocre. It is not flavorful, a bit bitter and for a breakfast restaurant that's known for their breakfast and mimosas, they are not known at all for their coffee. Although, we will be back, its a great menu and food is good."}
{"text":"A guest and I were seated on a busy Saturday morning within 10 minutes but no server came to our table for 7-10 minutes. No water or acknowledgement. We almost left. Maybe the staff was shorthanded. 

We ended up ordering because we wanted to give the restaurant a chance. When our food arrived, it was delicious but barely warm. 

Worth trying the pineapple upside down pancakes. Thick generous cakes that swam in a vanilla cream sauce, with chunky diced pineapple bits embedded in the pancakes. Bacon was thick and flavorful. Eggs cooked just right, slightly firm with yolk soft enough to run. 1 slice of toast though... for the price, an extra slice should have made an appearance."}
{"text":"I brought my foodie Dad here and we both loved it - him for the cool 60s decor and me for the environmental-friendliness. There was a very long line, but there's free coffee and water while you wait which is a nice touch. The best thing I ate was the chorizo, it's an absolute must-try! I'll be back to try the eggs benny on a less busy day."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews unless I get exceptionally good food or service (or both). Snooze continues to do both! My son and I were introduced to Snooze a few years ago in Colorado and had a good experience but since they came to AZ we go here 1-2 times a week. We always get great service here and the food - which is trendy standard breakfast fare but done very well. I'd also point out the staff is able to be unusually professional and friendly at the same time. We often get served at the new Ahwatukee location by Hayatt and she does an even more outstanding job of making sure we're well taken care of without being overbearing in the least. Great job Snooze! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"14 adults walked away from this location this morning. I arrived at 10:45 and checked in with the hostess.  The manager who was seating people had NO clue as to what he was doing.  We wanted to sit together and when a couple tables would leave the manager would reseat them. I went up several times to ask about our tables and the wait always seemed to get longer.  After over an hour and the resturant was full again we left.  Time to retrain or continue to loss customers.   The manager did't just  snooze he passed out.  They got one star only because the hostess where very nice."}
{"text":"Great food and great service--fun menu to boot."}
{"text":"Way over priced when your drink is almost half the cost of your meal. Good food and that would be the only reason I would ever come back. Hostesses allowed people to wait outside while having a good time messing around and laughing up at the counter, meanwhile leaving approximately 4 tables/booths open at all times. My first time visit was disappointing."}
{"text":"The energy and ambiance of this place is perfect for brunch! Snooze eatery has mastered the eggs Benedict, and the pancakes are simply the best. The staff was friendly and the food came out fast! This is one of my favorite spots to bring family from out of town."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in, and I'm glad we did.  The food tasted great.  The hash was delicious.  

Service was fast and professional.  Looking forward to coming back another time to try the Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Went for a nice Saturday breakfast wi my wife.  I had the single worst experience at a restaurant ever. After waiting for what seemed forever, we finally just sit at the bar. We place our order we waited and waited the waitresses said 4 times you order will be right up. All of a sudden we look at the clock and realized we have been waiting 2 hours. The waitress could not find it in the system, which means the waitress did not put in the order. So, we waited two hours to be lied to and left hungry. We were not even any sort of a coupon for a future visit. I will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"Snooze is a fantastic breakfast place! The Benedicts are to die for. I like to go here at least once a month"}
{"text":"Snooze is always a good spot for breakfast or brunch.. if you have the time and patience to wait. It's a pretty popular joint so always plan accordingly as the wait time will typically be at least be 30 minute to an hour long. 

This was my first time at this new location and surprisingly it wasn't as busy. Could also be because it was a weekday morning. 

Quality of food was great as always. I came here for my friend's birthday and she received a complimentary Cinnamon Roll pancake - which she loved! 

Their pancakes are actually one of my favorites on the menu. Generous sized and not too sweet. The sweet potato pancake is my personal favorite! 

Tip: the hash browns come cupped, which taste rather soggy in my opinion; so I always ask from them fried flat!"}
{"text":"20 min wait to be seated no big deal.  Once seated waited a hour to get our food.  Waiter only came once during that time to apologize.  Food was good but not worth the wait.  Waiter never even came back and gave us our check.  Another waitress came by and took my card"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service! I was very excited to this opening and was immediately treated as if \"everyday is my bday\" 5 star experience for any and all breakfast endeavors"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this AM with the family. They were busy, but the wait wasn't long for a table. Off to a slow start at the table since they were busy, but once our server got there she was on top of it and food came out quick! The menu is full of things you'll want to try making it hard to choose what to get (a good problem to have). The food was good, but no standout wow factor, just good but not great. That being said we are likely to come back and try some of the other menu items. Today I had the covered snooze spuds deluxe-good. Husband had the tofu scramble and didn't care for the texture (soggy). Daughter had French toast which was good. See pictures. Decor is cute and they have a nice patio area."}
{"text":"They can't handle a Saturday crowd. Our 20 minute wait turned into 45 minutes even though they had 10 open tables on the patio and 5-6 tables inside. Restaurant was half empty, and when we asked if they were short-staffed, they claimed they weren't. Food is good...creative dishes...but coffee is awful."}
{"text":"The blueberry danish pancakes here are really good. I also got the og eggs benedict, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either. The service was great and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Very popular and for good reason.  Excellent food.  Be prepared to wait but it's worth it.  Good menu.  Service was ultra friendly.  Cool eclectic decor.  They have free coffee while you wait which is a bonus in my book.  For a scramble and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time ive been to snooze and I love it. The food is great,waiters r nice.Totally love that u r on Ray Rd which is closer than Tempe don't change and of course ill be back"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at this place is delicious and is decently priced. They can also make almost anything gluten free. Service has been excellent every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh, affordable, and service was spectacular. One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I can't figure out why the reviews are good for this place.  The food is SALTY.  The service is slow and apathetic.  Sure, it looks cool & funky inside, but I prefer palatable good and friendly service."}
{"text":"I came in here today with a friend of mine to grab some breakfast. So we wait about 10 min to get seated and we start looking for our order. We decide, and put the order in. Not more than 20 second, no exaggeration, later I ask the waitress if I could change my order because I was kind of rushed in picking and changed my mind. No big deal right? Happens all the time. She says they couldn't change the order because she had already put it in. So, obviously annoyed that I would not enjoy the meal I would pay for, accepted this. My friend who was with me has been a server for about 5 years and said there's no reason why she shouldn't switch my order for what I truly want. So I ask a different waitress and she says the same thing, but says she will put in my new order. The food took around 35 min to come out, even though the only reason she said I could not change my order was because they start making it immediately which was obviously a lie, and the original food order comes out. I was so confused but around 10 min later my new order comes out, and I send the original plate back untouched with the woman who brought out my new food. So the bill comes and she had charged me for both meals! I call her over saying I would not pay for something I didn't eat, especially after the horrible service. So she just walks away, another server comes up accusing us of putting the food in my friends to go box as if we were trying to get a free meal. Like no hun, we were just not paying for food we didn't eat. She said \"well that's how this restaurant works for future notice\" in a very rude way. Needless to say, we will never come back here after the horrible service from multiple servers. For being new in the area, they should really be making a better impression."}
{"text":"Over-rated restaurant located in AMCshopping center on Ray Rd. Servers are overly sweet seeming \"needy\" for approval. Food was basic. This place is so busy and I'm not sure why. Tables inside and out."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. The menu covers all types of appetites.  The wait staff is superb. We mentioned it was our first time and asked for recommendations.  We all made our choices and even shared. 
Before our choice came out the waitress brought out a sample of their pineapple upside down pancake. DELICIOUS!  We all loved it.The combination of flavors was spot on. The buttermilk pancake was good all on its own. 
It was good to see they had a great mix of beverages available-- including a full bar. 
We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict ever.  And I normally don't eat hashbrowns but these were so favorable.  I can't wait to come back and try their Bloody Mary's.  Just come early.  I arrived at 7:30 and sat at the counter.  By 8:30 there was a wait list."}
{"text":"Went here for our first time, we were lucky in that we had no wait. Our server was very nice, and when she found out it was our first time eating here, she brought us a sample pancake! This place is a little on the expensive  side, and the reason I gave it 2 stars was that my husbands eggs benedict were cold all the way through. I ordered the breakfast tacos, and mine were good, so I am guessing they made my husbands first, and it sat there getting cold, and then made my tacos. Our total breakfast bill was over $30.00 for 2 meals, and no beverages, I told my husband to let our server know, but it had already taken so long for us to get our food. We are new to the area, and will cross this off our list of places to have breakfast."}
{"text":"First time at Snooze and having heard great things for a hip brunch location, I was quite excited! The wait took about 30 minutes for a busy Saturday morning. The staff was extremely friendly and although the wait was a bit long and they forgot a side of hash browns, the service and food was customizable and delicious! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, LOVE! Everything, absolutely everything was great! From waiting to be seated to paying the bill. Our waitress was super amazing, she offered us a try of one of their popular pancakes (I think she realized it was taking a little long, which wasn't even that long, at all) delish! I ordered the Benny Duo- Chile Verde Barbacoa  and Bella Bella. Wow, this is definitely a place that lives up to the hype, definitely would come again. I'm not a huge breakfast person but this isn't breakfast, it's like Hipster Breakfast! LOL! I don't know how to explain it, like healthy and gourmet."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast establishment around. Food is all so fresh. The morning drinks are awesome: like the bloody Mary's, mimosa, and Eggs & bacon bourbon. From the unique plays on eggs Benedict to the breakfast tacos to the breakfast pot pie. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well it's 7am and here we are at a very crowed Snooze. Came with my daughter and hubby for breakfast.  Ali has eaten at Snooze lots in San Diego and got us up early to drive 20 miles to get here. Oh my goodness. Clean and bright, with a very friendly hostess who sat us right away. We must of had lots of  luck that day because the people who came after us had to wait and when we left the line was about 30 people long. Our waiter  Chris ( I think that's his name short little guy of 6'5\") was at our table in less than 2 minutes.  He was wonderful  explained the menu and answered our questions. Coffee came next. Hot and delicious. Okay the food.  I had the pineapple upside down pancakes. Best pancake I ever had.  I want to go back soon the only problem is that because this resturant has such a following I need to get up at ungodly hour to get there early."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  I typically go to the location near ASU.  

First the good:  We ordered the Chile Verde Benedict and it was quite amazing.  The flavors were unbelievable.  We also got a Sum'oa Cake to split and it was pure heaven.  I am so impressed that they will split plates without any hassle.

Now for the issues here.  They sat us with the bartender (not at the bar).  There were at least 10 other staff members milling about and the place was only about 1/8 full.  Because she was making drinks and entertaining the guests sitting at the bar, she never once attempted to refill our coffees.  We had to flag down two different wait staff at separate times to get refills.  Also, our food came out ice cold, I am assuming because she was unable to check on it when it was done in the window.  It was eventually ran out to us by yet another wait person.  The flavors were right on.  The food was fresh.  Unfortunately, it was just ice cold.

Finally, there was a guy in the place that I would assume was the manager.  He spent a lot of time looking at his cell phone, but I think he should have been checking on tables to see how things were going.

I will give this location another chance, but will be certain to ask not to be seated with the bartender.

If it weren't for the service and cold food, I would have given 5 stars hands down."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! It was packed inside and out on a Saturday morning but it only took 10 minutes to get a table for 2. 

First, the ambiance and scenery was hip and chic. The music was nice...not too loud or soft and a great variety from hip hop (Migos) to pop! 

Second, the service was concierge...excellent. We never had dry mouths, dirty plates or anything else. Our server was upbeat, friendly and make great recommendations,

Now for the food....let me just say this is officially my Fav breakfast spot. We had the pancake flight (blueberry, pineapple upside down and the special for day...bacon filled), shrimp and grits, special spuds and mmm mmm mimosas. 

I'm going to try everything as you should too!"}
{"text":"On a busy Wednesday morning I found myself ousted from my home office and on the hunt for sustenance and caffeine.  Recently I had heard about a Snooze-- new eatery in Ahwatukee, so I decided to give it a try.  The decor was modern diner chic-- fun, but comfortable.  While the much lauded breakfast (I tried the Snooze Spuds Deluxe) would rate around three or four stars, the coffee was easily worth five stars.  My cappuccino was perfect!  What impressed me most was the wait staff-- they were friendly and accommodating.  While many restaurants rush customers out the door, the staff at Snooze encouraged me to take my time and relax.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Snooze but this location is so much better than all the rest!

Snooze is the happening place for brunch that brings a twist on traditional breakfast staples and adds a retro flair to it's decor. From the eggs Benedict that takes a twist to incorporate lox with caper relish to a sausage gravy stuffed pot pie, there is something for everyone!

We went here on Saturday and hour before they were closing. They were quick to help us and put our names down. They use a texting system to help alert you once your table is ready. They placed a few chairs outside to sit and wait, in which we only waited 10 minutes which is an all time record for us when we go to Snooze. 

Let me tell you the pros of this location:
- Tons of free parking! Thats right! No meters, and lots of free space to park, sign me up!
- The inside is huge, many other locations are confined by smaller buildings but this location was large and offered tons of booths for patrons to sit at.
- Quick staff, the fastest service I have ever received at a Snooze.

The staff was friendly and took care of us right away. I ordered the pot pie which used a flaky pastry crust, stuffed with country gravy, sausage and you typical pot pie fix-ins. The top was adorned with an egg that I ordered over Easy. Instead of hash browns, I ordered the pancake instead for a 4 dollar up charge. The best part, you can get any pancake, so I ordered the Pumpkin bourbon pancake and oh my goodness, it was perfection. The pancake had a sweet butter on top, with a cream cheese type of sauce drizzle along with bourbon syrup and tons of yummy nuts. My husband and I split this because it was huge. We loved it! Too bad it's seasonal, so get it while you can. My pastry was amazing, the flavors somehow blended perfectly and was not too heavy. I'd highly recommend if you want something different. Lastly my husband ordered the lox Eggs Benedict. I love the caper relish they put on top and the sauce is delicious.

We received our food in 10 minutes from ordering which was fantastic as I was starving. Overall, this location is definitely my favorite. The decor is a little more bland but this place knows how to move fast and make amazing food every time. Hope to see you at Brunch!"}
{"text":"Brunch lovers, this is a definite must try! I love going out for breakfast, and was certainly not disappointed. Everything on the menu looked delicious, I ordered the Bella Benedict, and a coffee, and my husband got a scramble with lox. They were both amazing! Service was excellent, but be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes on the weekend for brunch! That being said, it's worth it! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place just gets better every time! Different menu with flavorful choices. Not your typical breakfast place. This one has choices you've never dreamed of! Chili Verde Benes?? Yum!! Expect a wait (min 30 mins) but they'll text you when your table is ready, so put your name in and do a little shopping nearby."}
{"text":"Friday - 3/16 @ 8:30AM. Bad service. Period. After waiting for the hostess, we were seated. And that's the extent of acknowledgement we received. Multiple servers  walked by, not even a hello. We read over the menu and then put it away, as a sign that we're ready to order. Yet the party after us was greeted and seated with their server present. We were still waiting, can we at least be offered some water??? It's not like it was crazy busy, it was steady.

So after another 5 min of waiting we got up and left. Same hostess saw us leaving and just looked the other way. No bye, everything okay?, or have a good day.

So, we just walked next door to Modern Market. What a difference! Service and food. :)"}
{"text":"WOW! Best Breakfast place in this area! No one can compete! We got here and there was bit of wait but the fact you can pregame at the bar was amazing. The food was excellent and the service even better. I had the daily pancake and it was so good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time eating here and I will 100% be back.  The staff was very nice and on top of things.  There was always someone walking by your table willing to help and the best part is you didn't feel as if it was a bother to them to help one another.  I had a regular cup of coffee and it was perfect, not to weak or strong.  I had the Bella! Bella! Benny and omg! it was was amazing.  Try it, you won't regret it.  My husband has The B.E.A.T Sandwich and I got to try a bite.  It was really good and he enjoyed it as well.  We already have our next visit planned."}
{"text":"My second time coming here and it was wonderful..
Line was long but it went fast and they texted me when my table was ready ..
Food is fabulous!! Customer service is 100% !!
Atmosphere is family friendly !!
stop for the best breakfast and customer service !!
My kids asked when we could go back !!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long while, but for some reason I was intimidated to go inside! I don't know! Well, since they opened one in ahwatukee, I decided to give it shot since I didn't have to travel far haha. I got the duo benny with their original eggs Benedict and the green chile eggs benedict with barbacoa. Their original had a smoked cheddar hollandaise which was so GOOD!!! The barbacoa on the other benny was DELICIOUS! Also, their hasbrowns are also some of the best I've eaten. They almost had a sour cream and onion taste and it was presented so nicely, I would go back just for those alone! The only reason why I didn't give 4 stars was because my food didn't seem very warm when I got it, like maybe it had been sitting there for a bit before it came out to me, and some sides we ordered were forgotten. BUT I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have liked snooze for years, but the last 2 times I have ate at this location, our food has come out cold or lukewarm...."}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have a Snooze so close to home. Try the pumpkin spice pancakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go every weekend and the service/food is always fantastic. If you ever need a good mimosa and breakfast burrito, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. I miss the bloody Mary's due to getting pregnant but I look forward to have one again soon! The food is to die for!! If you don't get a pancake for the table, your lost."}
{"text":"Brunch restaurants are overrated and this place is another example of why. A party of two waited 45 minutes to be seated, 60 more minutes to get food, and 20 minutes to get the check. The food is good but definitely not worth the three hour wait."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! I'd like to thank Kelly, our server, as well as the assistant manager. They were very attentive to our needs. I really enjoyed the food, and they have a lot to offer for those who have special dietary needs. I have celiac disease so I can't have gluten, as well as a dairy allergy, and I was so pleased that there were many options for me. Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"Two benny duos (Bella Bella and I love you elote) & (I love you elote and I can't remember the other) along with one blueberry streusel pancake.... yuuum"}
{"text":"Best Hash-browns I have ever eaten at a breakfast place. HANDS Down. I eat the hash browns like twice a month. Lol"}
{"text":"This is always one of my favorite breakfast spots. Menu isn't huge, but everything is delicious. Everything from their classic breakfast, omelets, sandwiches to the {many} Benedict options is worth ordering. They do get pretty busy, but it's always worth the wait! 

Always ask for a side of green chile."}
{"text":"New without being too experimental or gimmicky.   Atmosphere has a good balance of casual and trendy. Food has good presentation and the dishes are well thought out, fresh versions of classics.  Perfect portion sizes, appropriate pricing and most important, very tasty.  Healthy minded and indulgent at the same time!?!? We'll be back, and we'll see if consistency earns that 5th star."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Snooze and I was impressed. The place has beautiful modern decoration and seating. It has both inside and outside seating. The food menu has variety of choice and special for vegetarian people like me. I got the mushroom omelet and man it was delicious. You can substitute meat with tofu and harsh brown  with fresh fruits. The service was good as well even though they were extremely busy. Overall I am really happy with my visit and probably will come back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars if possible. Food is fine, service is decent, but they can be misleading about their pricing and how they charge you. 

For some of the dishes, you choose your add-ins, and anything additional would be charged extra. However, we were told by the manager that their system \"automatically charges you for the more expensive item\" instead of including that as part of your original add-in. Add a $.75 veggie and they'll instead charge you for the $1.75 meat instead. Their receipts are vague so it's not explicitly written on there for what you've been upcharged.

This is the second time we've had to argue about this. Keep track of what your total amount should be before they give you the receipt. They'll refund you as \"pickle $\" but will tell you they'll \"only do it this once.\" I asked for this to be written on the menu so customers aren't misled, but they weren't very responsive to the idea."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch to celebrate my friends 21st bday and had a blast. We were told it was about a 45-60 minute wait time, but only waited 30 minutes which was perfect. However while we waited we sat at the bar and ordered some tasty (overpriced) mimosas. The bartender was super friendly and fast, but because we weren't eating food they asked us if we could move to the side for those that wanted to eat and sit at the bar. I also loved that they texted me to let me know our table was ready it was super convenient. The hostess Brooklyn was very friendly which made the experience even better. The food was delicious and i think the prices were very reasonable for the food. They went above and beyond and brought out a pancake with candles for my friends bday and sang happy birthday!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my 1st time eating here. I had the shrimp and grits and added mushrooms to it. It was delicious!!! Definitely will be coming back oft"}
{"text":"I would actually give 3 1/2 stars if possible.

Where to start? OK cool vibe, modern and hipster vibe. So far great.  I sat at bar, they were attentive enough-brought my coffee quickly.  

Uh oh. One sip and I was transported to  a middle of nowhere Denny's. WTF?  I can't remember having such an inferior cup of coffee at a real restaurant.  It was weak and bitterish- like mom and dads Folgers used to be.  Ugh!

And this my friends is the main reason for the lower rating. It's a BREAKFAST restaurant!  

I choose a different type dish: breakfast pot pie. Puff pastry, rosemary sausage gravy topped by an egg cooked your way.  The pastry part of meal scores 4.5. Tasty and creative. The hash browns were cooked  well, but bland as hell. 2.5 for them. 

Service was fine- good, not great or bad. 

I'm undecided on if I'll go back: mainly because it's breakfast, and I'll want coffee!  I just may though- I'd  get my octane before I go.

I say give it a try- just beware the coffee!"}
{"text":"I like it and would go again even if it was date night. Staff was really friendly an helpful. Although the folks at the bar didn't even ask if I wanted something to drink while I waited for my order. But besides that all was good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing food and drinks. The wait was a bit long but the service made up for it. Our server, Rachel K, was attentive and friendly. She made sure our visit was a pleasant one. I ordered the Benny Goodman and it was to die for. We also ordered a few pancakes for the table that were devoured. Overall, extremely happy with the new locationa and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Today was an unsatisfying experience at Snooze. Initially when I moved here back in Jan. 2018, walking to this eatery was like Heaven to me. My first, second & even third time were great great meals. The last 2 visits here were mediocre at best. Quality control has faltered, as my hash browns were a block of mush on one side and burnt on the other, not just on my plate, but my husbands as well. It's very rare for me to say anything other than everything is great when the server comes to check on us. This time I didn't give it another thought. They were horrid! The server was great and took them away and gave me a complimentary fruit plate, which we were happy splitting instead of our hash browns. My scrambled eggs were ok, ham was good, toast with jam was yummy. Overall not that feeling of WOW Snooze is amazing! Especially for the price. I think it will be awhile before I try it again, I know for a fact Denny's has browns are delicious, and much less expensive. They say you get what you pay for, well if I'm paying a premium for a dish, I want my dish spectacular!"}
{"text":"The lattes here are amazing and I can't ever go without getting the breakfast tacos. So yummy!!!  The Ahwatukee location is nice and big so the wait time is less than other places. Great lunch too!"}
{"text":"Before anything, the service was exceptional! The estimated wait time at prime time Brunch was about an hour, but it came out to 40 minutes. They have a text system that'll tell you your table is ready, so I did some grocery shopping in between, and held a table for my party when we came back.

 The food was excellent, the blueberry Danish pancakes came with pancakes of a formidable size. I paired it with a mm mm mimosa, quite delicious. Wife had the BEAT sandwich, just as delicious!

The kids portions were very generous, looked big enough for an adult. The eggs were a bit bland though."}
{"text":"Was in Phx for a wedding last week had breakfast here on Saturday. This place was crackin! Super busy, but with good reason. Our food was outstanding as was the service. Kept the coffee cup full which I really appreciated. Brought a couple of the pineapple upside down pancakes to the table as a gift. They were awesome! I had a scramble with tomato, bacon, onion , avacado and cheese and it was terrific. 15-20 min wait on a Saturday, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Snooze twice now and I plan to make it again and again as often I can!
Simply put, this place is amazing. Love the vibe, loved the food. The pineapple upside down pancakes are simply the best you could ever hope for. The OMG French toast is also amazing. So if you are reading this and debating whether to go to Snooze or not, quit wasting your time reading this and don't miss out on the Snooze experience!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found Snooze. Actually I drove by many times but hasn't stopped in so after church Sunday trekked over.

Even though no gluten free menu, a lot of items can be made gluten free. I had frittata which is naturally gluten free, it tasted great and no tummy issues afterwards 


It's a busy spot on Sunday for those brunchers wanting mimosas etc

There's a lot of options for me to try"}
{"text":"Very good food with very slow service. Fairly expensive for a breakfast place so pack your patience and wallet."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday morning so as expected, we had about a 30 minute wait.  Love that they offer coffee while you wait...one suggestion: have somebody in charge of the station so things stay full.  We initially came up to an empty coffee pot and empty creamer container but things were refilled immediately upon saying something.

Love the interior; very chic!  We were served by Hayatt, who is efficient but running, running, running!  Took a few minutes to get her to warm up but once she did, she was personable and even gave us hugs when we were leaving.  

I had a side, plain pancake and an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and jack cheese.  Partner had the Snooze Classic with the pulled pork.  OMG...the pork was fabulous!  We loved the flavor of it.  The potatoes are great too, although next time we will ask for a bit more crispy.  

Overall, a 5-star experience.  We even had a visit with the General Manager who stopped by.  Yes...most likely you will have a wait when going but so worth it!!!  Can't wait to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I went to their San Diego location and fell in love. I was super excited to see that there was one in PHX! The wait wasn't too bad. It was a thirty min wait but they sat us in 15 mins. Saw it was pet friendly which I love, since I'm a pet lover. 

I went for the lower east sider plate and it was delicious! If you are looking for a great breakfast and brunch place, Snooze is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"You didn't make the smartest decision by going on a Sunday morning for our first experience! The place was absolutely packed with a 30 to 45-minute wait! I will say that once we did enjoy it! I would like to go back during the week or maybe when it's not so crowded! The options on the menu amazing! I feel like I could go here every day for two weeks and look at the same thing! Prices were reasonable I just thought it was way too packed!"}
{"text":"All I can say is yes yes yes yes! I love the pancake options, the drink options, and the spuds deluxe as well as the eggs and Sammy. The staff Is also as attentive as they Canby with the constant flow of customers they are have to deal with. Kudos to the overall experience!"}
{"text":"Normally my experiences at Snooze have been great.  However, this morning I was served a cold breakfast.  The restaurant manager did apologize and offered to fix it but we didn't have the time to wait for another serving to be prepared."}
{"text":"Never had such a bad breakfast. Ordered an omelet with mushrooms and sausage and cheese... the mushrooms tasted like the ones from a can, slimy and all. Not sure there was any sausage and the egg wasn't done. The hash browns were over seasoned (normally I'm complaining they didn't season) and they weren't done! They weren't hash they were greasy undone potatoes. I didn't eat any of it. Waitress didn't say anything about my uneaten meal. The waitress was obviously a morning person which was great but is it really appropriate to keep calling my 67 year old mother \"honey\"? I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here last Sun 12/17/17. Server was Hyatt, she was nice, attentive and funny.
We both had breakfast. I had what was  equivelent to biskets an gravey but on a cresaint, eggs over medium, hash browns cake and side sausage patty. Wife had a mix of eggs benedict.  You can get two different ones with one meal. To top it off she suggested we get a pancake, pineapple upsidedown. This was excellent. Food was really good, coffee was a specialty blend and tasty. Overall wait time (they txt you), service and food were very good. 1 negitave is prepare to talk loud the place had no ceiling insulation and is very noisy. Always like having another breakfast place in Ahwatukee, since this is where the MiMi's was."}
{"text":"Got there as a single at 10:30. The wait was 30 minutes she said..it was 11:13 when I sat down ready to order. Chris was my waiter, happy, informative. Took my order. Simple breakfast, nothing fancy. My food got there at 11:38, just warm. The OJ Was cold, the food was just warm and average tasting. I do not think I would go back for an hour wait for just average food.  I will keep looking for my special breakfast spot. 
The one nice thing was they offer complementary water and coffee while you wait. Good on a warm day."}
{"text":"OMG French toast and pineapple upside down pancakes! Absolutely delicious. Great service. Get there early or expect to wait, but it's worth the wait. Bloody Mary's are yummy as well."}
{"text":"I've been to the Tempe location a few times and it seems to flow a lot better than this location. I'm guessing it's because it's new. A few friends and I came in on a Saturday morning and it was packed. We were told it'd be 15 minutes and we ended up waiting 30. We understood because it was so busy. We had a very sweet server but a few things got forgotten. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary with bacon and didn't receive the bacon. I ordered a side of fruit with my meal that I didn't receive but was charged for as well. I ordered the spring has sprung frittata. It lacked a lot of flavor and needed hot sauce and salt, I probably wouldn't order it again. A friends orders got a little mixed up, they ordered the same dish, one was gluten free and the other had no cheese but it was no biggie. I think that since this place just got up and running it's just a bit slow and unorganized at this point. I will probably come again in a few months to try it out again. My friend got the green Bloody Mary and only said good things! As for right now I'll stick to the Tempe location. I"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations of this new location, seeing as all the other Snooze Cafe's I have been to, have been \"TO DIE FOR\" this one....definitely won't be back. Coffee was SUPER bitter, their hot chocolate tasted like hot milk with no cocoa flavor. Ordered Breakfast Pot Pie and a Sweet Potato Pancake, the pie was cold, like it had been sitting out for a good period of time before getting to the table. The pancake was VERY unimpressive. Had maybe 5 pecans, a SMALL amount of caramel drizzle and an AWFUL aftertaste that I just couldn't get past, this along with the Hot Milk & bitter coffee were sent back. I ate the Breakfast Pot Pie, because honestly I didn't want to wait...really disappointed with this new location! We had originally found this place in Colorado and were excited when we heard there were locations in AZ."}
{"text":"Always good!   Crowded but worth the wait !  I had the shrimp and grits ..  it was amazing..   my son loved it too but will probably order off the adult menu next time ..    for little kids it's a great deal .."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Pot Pie is life changing. Cappuccino is bomb as well. Even though it was a bit busy when we arrived, seating was prompt and the service was awesome. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Snooze was this new location shortly after it opened several months ago. I had heard good things about the food and love a good breakfast place, so was super excited to have one open near our house. The first time we went out server was not great. The restaurant was busy, but he never even came over to our table until we had to ask the hostess where he was. Even after that, he was pretty absent and we had to ask repeatedly for things like drink refills, condiments, etc. I am giving Snooze 4 stars partly because the food was pretty good, but more importantly because one of the other wait staff, Sydni, was very friendly and helpful, even though we weren't sitting at her table. She went out of her way to come visit with our baby, refill our waters when she saw they were empty, and basically make up for the lack of service from the other employee. Since that visit, we have been back and had a better experience, but we definitely would not have been back a second time if it were not for her."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming. I can see why this place stays busy! The hollandaise is one of the most popular dish. I thought what the heck its my birthday I will give it a try. I got the bene duo. Great portion for the entree! The food was delicious. The downside was the wait and service was slow. I would definitely come again though."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find they opened a location near my niece's home.  We tried them for lunch, and as usual, the service was amazing, the venue light and airy. 

My niece was torn between the ham benedict and the pineapple upside down pancake - imagine her delight when she found you could substitute a pancake for the potatoes!  

I tried the Rueben sandwich and the corn beef was moist and downright yummy!  This was the first time that I found the potato casserole to be spiced not to my liking - I couldn't quite identify what it was.   Next time, I will substitute a side salad.  

Definitely back on my list!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Great service. Fun atmosphere. Kind of pricey for breakfast.

If it weren't so pricey it would get5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can get pretty busy if you go during the morning rush hour but if you get there early enough you will find a spot. Food is great and so is the coffee!"}
{"text":"I normally don't do posts on here but I had to give a quick S/O to our fantastic waitress, Eris. She went above and beyond to make our experience at Snooze fabulous! She was super on top of everything down to even the smallest details. Thank you so much for being so great Eris!"}
{"text":"Pros:  The food is always very good (those hashbrowns).  There is a lot of energy in the restaurant on a weekend.  The free coffee while you wait for a table. 

Needs work:  On the weekend it's just people spilling into the parking lot and sitting on curbs.  They can improve that system.  The service has been spotty in my visits. The drink prices are quite steep for a breakfast/lunch place.  

In the end a great addition to Ahwatukee and the best Snooze location I've been to."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and the service was good but a little slow because they were so busy for Sunday brunch. We enjoyed our time, I just wasn't enthusiastic about my eggs Benedict I ordered. It was the Bella Bella with cream cheese hollandaise, burrata, and I think a slice of soft cheese (not noticeable with all the hollandaise) and a balsamic drizzle on a ciabatta slice. It sounds a lot better than what it ended up being. The meat was folded and only covered about 1/4 of the toast so 3/4s of my meal was just egg and toast. The cream cheese hollandaise just tasted like regular hollandaise. The balsamic was so minimal I didn't taste it.
My husband loved his breakfast pot pie, I will get that next time!"}
{"text":"Took our friend from out of town here and she loved it . We were able to get the pancake sampler to share.  We got blueberry danish original and sweet potato all were delicious but personally a whole one would be too sweet for me . The service there is top notch everyone is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place the wait was a little long but it was worth it. I had the Snooze Classic which included eggs sausage and hash browns. I had a pancake instead of the toast. Everything was delicious. Service was slow but they were so busy it was understandable."}
{"text":"I love this place!  well worth the time & money keeps you full all day!  I had the best eggs Benedict of my life even though I bit my tongue while eating this delicious food- I would do it again SMH
I was thinking about how good the food was all day, seriously!"}
{"text":"First time @ snooze great food - excellent service. Menu has variety and our server was great. Eggs Benedict yum and next time mimosas!"}
{"text":"Definitely are the choose from all of the tempting things on the menu. I would highly recommend any of the eggs Benedict. You can even mix and match sure benedicts, which is a huge plus.  

 The atmospere is quirky but very open and cool. There is covered patio seating in addition to the spacious indoor area. Our weight turn or waitresses have always been nice here. Expect a bit of a wait on the weekends but there is free coffee at the reception area to make it a little more bearable.

My wife is a mimosa person and I am a bloody Mary guy so we both have ample options to choose from on the menu.There are also a ton of custom pancakes and you will not be disappointed by anything you choose on the menu."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! If you're looking for great food quality, and wonderful staff look no further than Snooze! You WILL NOT be disappointed! A very special shout out to Bobbi, Annika, Monica.... BAM! You Rock!"}
{"text":"Disappointed at the length of time to wait for the food and service.  After being seated the service was sub-par, drinks took close to 10 minutes to arrive and then followed by a 30 minute wait for the food.  Other patrons who were seated later than us, received their food much quicker as we can see them eating, while waiting for anyone to offer a refill of drinks.  Felt like we were forgotten, until time to pay the check. Service may be better at other locations."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a table with an empty patio and watched a lot of people get seated before us, then we were told it'd be \"at least ten more minutes.\" Apparently the \"kitchen [was] overwhelmed as of an hour ago.\"  You'd think that after the holidays someone would have the foresight to maybe schedule more kitchen staff..?  I won't bother coming back."}
{"text":"Pros: The service was good.  Our family tried a variety of food. Loved the Mayan mocha, hash browns, pineapple upside down pancake, and steak Benedict. 

Cons: We sat on the patio and the music was too loud.  Pancakes were a bit over sweet.  

Staff is hardworking and sincere. They look like they love their jobs which says a lot about management. Looking forward to our next visit..."}
{"text":"3.5/5

You Snooze you lose! At least that's what I thought when we left here around 10ish and there were already people waiting outside for a table. It wasn't too busy around 9ish when we got here though; there were plenty of tables available. 

The interior is very retro. There's lots of orange and avocado green, with decor and menu design that harkens back to the '60s. The menu is very modern though, and I love how there's a little bit of everything for any type of appetite. Want something sweet? There's a lot of delicious pancake options. Want something lighter? There's a special section for healthier fare. Want a traditional breakfast? They have that too. I also really liked how there are multiple vegetarian and vegan options, and that any scramble can be made vegan by substituting tofu. 

I started off with a latte with almond milk. It had a nice foamy layer with pretty latte art. The coffee was decent, although it did have a slight sour tinge to it. 

After reading the description for it I knew I had to get the egg white frittata. It had wild mushrooms, garlic and roasted sweet potatoes topped with dressed arugula, cherry tomatoes, spiced pepitas, roasted corn salsa and shaved manchego. That's quite a lot of ingredients, and delicious ones to boot! There are no other sides that go with this dish, only the frittata. It was a good sized circle of egg white with a beautiful bounty of vegetables on top. I loved the different flavors and textures in each bite. The eggs themselves were light and fluffy, you can tell they did a great job whipping the egg whites to get them that nice ethereal texture. I didn't miss the yolk at all in this dish. If you want a little heat in your dish, they offer Cholula, Tabasco hot sauces (There might be another brand but I forgot which one it was). The Cholula comes in red or green! I've never seen green Cholula before, what a jalapeno revelation!

My friend who I ate with asked our server if she could have the same frittata, but with full egg instead of just egg white. The server wasn't sure and she didn't seem very eager to try to find out if the kitchen could offer this. I don't really see why they wouldn't be able to make a regular frittata and I'm not sure why they don't also offer this as a regular egg option. I've had plenty of egg white+yolk frittatas and they've come out fine. She ended up getting something similar, a regular scramble, with some of the same ingredients as the frittata.

I did feel like the price was a bit hefty for what we got. The latte was $4.50, and with almond milk an extra charge on top of that. For about the same price I can get a really good latte from one of my favorite coffee shops, and the frittata was also a little pricey for my tastes since I only received a single frittata with no other accompaniments included. Quite honestly I was still hungry after eating my meal. I don't doubt that they use high quality ingredients for the breakfast dishes though, and I do know that part of the proceeds goes towards giving back to the community (1% of sales). 

As for the noise level, I didn't really feel like it was a very relaxing place to have breakfast or brunch. As more people came in to eat, it got really noisy and the music is more fast paced and also a bit loud so towards the end of my meal it was hard to converse with my friend without straining my ears or saying \"What?\" a few times.

I did see a nice little patio area that is dog friendly. I'd love to go back with the pups and have a nice breakfast or brunch on that patio sometime."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since the grand opening and twice ordered the same breakfast because don't fix what's not broke , amiright??? Order the green chili Benedict because it has a spicy hollandaise sauce that you have never tried before anywhere else. My dad order the pineapple upside down pancakes which looked amaze!"}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch spot has a very fun vibe! The restaurant colors are bright and welcoming to start your morning off. I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and was incredibly pleased! The bread was SO good almost tasting like a flaky puff pastry. Their sausage gravy lights up your taste buds because it is homemade. Not your average pot pie but definitely worth a try! On top of the pot pie you can have it topped with an egg of your liking. Typically I get over easy because I love it when the yolk is runny. I got hash browns on the side... extra crispy. Mm, I love a good brunch spot."}
{"text":"The Snooze chain is my favorite brunch in the country. Not exaggerating. I went with my family, after a recent trip to Boston where my mom and I looked for the best french toast in the city. We could not compare any of the french toasts we tried elsewhere to the OMG at Snooze. They also get their pineapples fresh from Hawaii regularly (and the servers will usually let you know if you ask). The spuds deluxe is also great for sharing between 2 people. While you wait, you can play ping pong or walk around University. Love this place. Thanks!"}
{"text":"In town visiting and love loved loved this place our server was so knowledgeable and such a great help on choosing th the right dish. The food came out on in perfect time and the glasses were never empty. So much flavor amazing prices. Definitely coming back everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"I liked tbe ambience. The outdoor seating looked nice. Chose an booth along the wall for more of a dim setting. Great place for conversation.

The food was amazing both in presentation and taste. Breakfast food pretty much never feels me up so I at least want it to taste good and this place did not disappoint.

The prices were right on target $8.95 - $15.95 (I believe) but that was the steak and eggs. Average $10.95 - $12.95. Didn't have a drink but $6 -$12"}
{"text":"Everything we had was absolutely amazing. Service was excellent. My husband had the classic with chorizo which was a patty. He loved it. My son ordered the pancake flight...I had one bite and talk about melt in your mouth perfectness. Then there is my eggs Benedict. It was perfect.  My son tried them for the first time and said that was what he was ordering from now on. We will be back because this place is awesome!!! Hubby said his Bloody Mary was the best he's had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried to find a reason to dislike this place just to help me from not being a regular and, I have Nothing ugh:( This place is amazing, fresh fruit, very tasty drinks and the pancake of the day is never the same. If you can't make up your mind about which pancake to order just choice three different kind and call it a day:) customer service is wonderful, everyone is friendly and welcoming. Super clean! Would I tell a friend or two? You betcha ;) already have LoL."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing. Expensive for what you get. $11 for a small side salad that had little of anything in it. A couple of purple carrot strips and some walnuts. Whee. 

I had a Rueben sandwich for about $16. Again, not bad but nothing special. Should have gone next door to Modern Market."}
{"text":"Needs some work. Menu is very unique and variety is great. People friendly. Taking orders very efficient. Food service needs work. Food coming out warm to cool. Had to return an item. Bacon crispness not consistent."}
{"text":"We had to wait 30 min but well worth it! Hostess was sweet, waitress fantastic and food delicious! The only problem was having to make a decision on what to order!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and will absolutely come back again and again. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"The service  was A+ all due to Hayatt. She kept out drinks filled.  Very knowledgeable about the menu. It was a good time. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Snooze is probably my favorite brunch spot in AZ. I recommend coming during the week cause weekends the wait can be over an hour. 
Our waitress was super nice and accommodating. We came in for my birthday and my friends insisted on telling her it was my birthday so she said I'll see what I can do. She brought out a cinnamon pancake. Soooo good!!! 
I usually order Chili Verde Benedict, so good. It has the perfect amount of spice without being too spicy!"}
{"text":"Oh....yeah! You should go here.

Take my time and money! Tacos for the girls, steak for the boys and more menu items for the entire gender spectrum. These are not your grandma's eggs. They are flipping (pun intended(eggs)) the breakfast genre on it's head. 

Take advantage of the optional \"hour wait time\" experience. It really makes you feel like you are about to eat some good ass breakfast--and you will!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Wild Horse Pass, this Eatery is just a hop and a skip away. 

Impressed by the complimentary coffee while you wait for a table, nice touch for a restaurant that seems to always have a waitlist. For a chain restaurant I appreciate how they seem to go out of their way to support local charities and buy some locally sourced ingredients. Their mission to help serve their local communities reminded me a lot of Even Stevens Sandwiches. The staff were all sporting some type of PRIDE support, also really great! 

We had the regular Beni III and the Breakfast Pot Pie, with 1 side breakfast taco and 1 side pancake. The pancake was disappointing, really dry. The hash browns that came with our meals were ok, not my favorite. They were more of a hash brown casserole-ish thing, kind of dry with a lot of pepper. 

The breakfast taco was delicious, the green chile hollandaise on top of it was so good. They are good at hollandaise here because the hollandaise on the Beni was also on point- with plenty of lemon- just the way I like it! The ham on the Beni was flavorful and tasty. The Breakfast Pot Pie was a fun play on a traditional biscuits and gravy, we enjoyed it, their rosemary sausage gravy was really wonderful, light, but still rich at the same time. Not an overwhelmingly heavy gravy. 

The service was a-ok. Surprised to see so many people waiting and so many empty tables at the same time? Maybe they didn't have enough staff to keep up? 

Seems like a great place for a family breakfast, menu has plenty of traditional options and some more adventurous choices as well. Will gladly return when in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfasts when things are not rushed. On Sunday mornings things just fall apart: you can't get a coffee refill and the food comes out cold.  The rest of the week they are spot on."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price! The benedicts are amazing and the pancakes are out of this world. There is no breakfast place around that compares."}
{"text":"All I can say is I wish I had one of these restaurants in Wisconsin! This is my second visit to this restaurant for brunch while visiting Arizona. My first experience was last year and it blew me away! So I was so excited to return on my visit this year for another amazing brunch! I can't say enough about how much I love this place. Their menu is absolutely fantastic and the service is always wonderful. And did I mention how tasty their drinks are? If you love bloody Mary's, definitely give it a try. The Mimosa is very refreshing as well. I'm a huge fan of eggs Benedict and I love the fact that you can try to different types as an entrée. That's what I did last year when I was here and that's what I did again this year when I was here. I wish I could eat here every weekend, that would be a dream come true!!! Can't wait to come back next year and have another amazing brunch! Until then your delicious eggs Benedict will be in my dreams!!!"}
{"text":"This is actually the first snooze I've been to where the service wasn't terrible. We had a 30 min wait and gave our number for text and they were very accurate with the wait time. I really appreciated the server for repeating the special to me and explaining my choices and cost. I probably should have ordered the large special cinnamon white chocolate chip pancake, but I got a flight of pancakes with a French toast. Pancakes however were dry. Food is sweet but standard. You come here more for the \"environment.\" But make no mistake, here is a good choice."}
{"text":"The food was good.. the pancake of the day (candied bacon) was amazing..  the only negative thing I can say is that the service could be a little better.. we went there when they opened so there weren't a lot of people yet but our food could have been hotter along with the hot chocolate it seemed like it was sitting at the counter for a lil bit.. and our waitress could have checked on us a little more..other then that we enjoyed our food here."}
{"text":"This restaurant wasn't very hard to become a regular at. I come atleast once a week for over a month now. The brewmosas are delicious and I've tried almost everything on the menu and nothing ever seems to disappoint. Treat yourself to a flight of pancakes. That wrong will always feel right. Great staff that always make you feel welcome. Love the snoozers, especially KC!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love snooze?? Either in the morning when you hit your alarm, or to eat at!! 

The lines are long... for a reason. It has very good breakfast items... with a more high class twist. The breakfast burrito is a fave... with the green Chile sauce. Add some bacon ( and I do light on the black beans), and you have perfection. 

And part of the secret is to call your order in & take it home or to a nice park to enjoy! Skip the line!"}
{"text":"So many items on the menu that I wanted to try but could only have one. Still, got the combo benedict and it was delicious. One with the green chile the other on the corn masa. Very popular, the wait was 45 minutes but we checked in with the yelp app and got seated in 20."}
{"text":"A wonderful meal.  Creative and fresh. Do not miss a chance to eat at Snooze!  Sweet potato pancakes are light and sweet.  My wife had the daily special which was lemon blueberry pancakes.  Very mild flavor that was perfect.  No syrup necessary.  The service is first rate."}
{"text":"I love snooze! Such an awesome atmosphere and amazing energy from the staff! They have a dog friendly patio which is so cool, and it has a gate so if your pup is rambunctious like mine you can tie them up! They bring a little doggy bowl with water. The OMG French toast is amazing! I also got an egg scramble. You can 100% taste the quality in their food, worth the extra couple bucks. 
WELCOME TO AHWATUKEE, SNOOZE!!!"}
{"text":"Since it's opening there's been a line out the door.  Fun atmosphere and good service but I was disappointed w/the food and the coffee.  

We had the breakfast pot pie- sausage was tasty but there just wasn't enough of it so it was just bland and the Bella Bella Benny- poached eggs were done to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was out of this world.

Surprisingly the coffee was pretty ordinary and weak.  Hip places like this typically have amazing coffee.

I will give this place another try and if I don't like my food choice again I'll just have a mimosa to make it all better!"}
{"text":"Went to Snooze to enjoy brunch with my daughter,  at 10:45 A.M. we had a 45 minute wait, heck it was a Saturday. No one acknowledged the wait. The waitress was just going through the routine. If you hate your job get a new one.  The service was slow and unorganized. The sweet potato pancakes were delicious. The rest of the food was marginal like the experience. This location was sub-par."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Their pancake flight is fun if a bit decadent. Try the OMG French Toast as one of the 3 choices. It works well to share as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Just your average breakfast place with a finesse twist. I wasn't really a big fan of this place for a couple of reasons.

 One thing I didn't like about this place is that everything was greasy! I ordered the Snooze classic with extra grease.  If You were to touch the side of plate, walk outside, crack an egg on your palm, you would have a perfectly fried egg. The chicken sausage was also ok but once again so much grease! My friends plate was also in the same condition with grease all on the sides of the plate. 

Eggs were cooked to perfection, the hash browns were crispy and seasoned well. The iced coffees were delicious and there Cuban cups of coffee. 

Overall, customer service is there and got us in and out."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, good food. Full bar with breakfast? Uh yeah! The veggies in the Bloody Mary's are pickled and delicious, don't ignore them! Quality ingredients in every bite. Cut to it, best breakfast in the Ahwatukee area hands down. Unless you like the microwaved meat salt at Cracker Barrel, lol."}
{"text":"DO. NOT. COME. HERE. ON. THE. WEEKEND. I made the mistake of strolling up to this location at 11am on a Sunday and was BLOWN AWAY. There was a line going right into the street and it was chaos. I heard a lot about Snooze but had no idea it was THIS popular. I came here with a friend for a birthday brunch and we waited about 40 minutes for a table. They have a text notification system to let you know when your table was ready...but it didn't work for us. Anywho, when we finally were seated it was on the patio which was great because of the nice weather. Dogs are allowed out on the patio and that was nice too since I like dogs (but unfortunately don't have any). The service was great, and the food was FANTASTIC. Try the OMG French Toast and Mimosas, they're game changers. I really enjoyed the place overall and had a great time. Just make sure to call ahead and be ready to claim your seat...or someone else will."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/lunch place in ahwatukee.  Great menu/food/prices and atmosphere.  I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"The Bangkok Bloody Mary is hands down the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. They make their own pickles for garnish and I would buy them in a jar if they'd sell them! OMG French Toast was awesome too. Great food.

Minus a star for ambiance. It was crazy loud. So loud my husband & I couldn't have a conversation across the table. Also, it was packed so we knew food wouldn't be out instantly but it was pretty slow, about 20-25 min from ordering to food. Other people seem to have had amazing service but ours was lack-luster, nice enough waitress but when we ran out of drinks we had to search for her to order another."}
{"text":"Snooze has very good food and I am never disappointed with it. It just takes forever to get seated and once you are seated the service is also slow! It's a fun atmosphere and place to eat if you have half a day to waste here. I'd much rather go elsewhere to Butter's/Butterfield's where yes, there is a wait, but they are very fast with moving tables along. Snooze needs to work on making food faster. It's just breakfast, not a gourmet meal. People also do camp out at tables all morning too so moving tables isn't very fast because people don't leave."}
{"text":"Eris made a regularly great Snooze visit awesome!!! The food was delicious, the service was excellent and they were able to get us seated faster than expected though it was Easter! Going to snooze ensures a great day, because they take great care of their customers! Thank you Eris!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great vibes. Happy to have you in Ahwatukee, Snooze! New \"pancake of the day\" everyday and lots of great weekend brunch drinks. OMG french toast is seriously O.M.G!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and atmosphere. But, curiously, there is a 60 minute wait when there are more than 15 tables open and ready for occupants. Not sure if this is the new business model. However, doesn't seem smart when people are walking away."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Great decor, fun menu and even a full bar with multiple mimosa options and cafe cocktail. Not your typical breakfast only restaurant. I am just happy being here. 

I managed to get a healthy egg white with veggies omelette and a fresh OJ. But next time I will be more adventurous."}
{"text":"The wait times are ridiculous. We waited over 30 mins to get seated. And once we got seated and waited another ~30 mins to get our food. I would recommend having a small bite before coming here. The only downside is the wait times. The breakfast is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday morning. It was really busy (kids were out of school for Veterans Day). My friend and I put our name on the waiting list. Hostess said it would be 20-25 minutes.  We drank coffee from the complimentary station setup at entrance.   We received a text 10 minutes later saying the table was ready. The environment is nice and decor is modern with lots of orange!!!! 
Our waitress was really nice and helpful. My friend got the shrimp and grits while I opted for the egg white omelet with bacon, cheese, peppers, and pico de Gallo with an English muffin with strawberry jelly. My friend also ordered a mimosa.  The waitress recommended the Fallin and my bestie really liked it. 
I tasted my friend shrimp and it was really good and flavorful ( reminds me of New Orleans BBQ Shrimp)!! It was really good.  My dish was good also.. bacon makes everything right!!! Also the jelly was really. Good.  
I think this is going to be my new favorite breakfast spot in Chandler when visiting my family!!!"}
{"text":"Went to snooze today for breakfast this place is top notch. The bloody Mary's are amazing !!!! Food was top notch I had the breakfast burrito To die for. My husband got the eggs Benedict is bomb"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant. Staff was friendly & I didn't feel rushed. There's a bar area in the front but it's doesn't deter the place from being family friendly. I took my 12 year old & 1 yr old. Food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and finished it. My daughter ordered Nannas hot chocolate pancakes & it had a huge marshmallow on top & came with a chocolate syrup sauce. It was too much for her but if you want a dessert to share that breakfast dish is great! Lots of options for different diets. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was outstanding. The food was delicious. The coffee was fantastic.I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Just took our friends from out of town here and tried the Pineapple Upside Down Pancake. Oooooh my god was that good! I was very set on my Sandwich I Am, but now I want more pancakes. Everything at this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Snooze is always a jam. Let's be real, it's so good and always an amazing experience. Always, you're not reading this for reviews of the food, there are plenty of those. Try reading this for the service. It's impeccable. we were always well kept, always water topped off, and is just a great time. We were seated even though our entire party was not there, but it was okay. did not feel rushed one bit. great work guys. Thanks for he great time to catch up with friends, and to be able to enjoy some amazing food."}
{"text":"Food: delicious
Service: friendly and attentive
Price: $$
Overall: 

Snooze has consistently been one of my favorite Saturday morning brunch spots, but today was the best experience I've had yet. Our server, Tiff, was so sweet and helpful today. Her warm personality took a delicious, fun experience to a level that my friends and I won't soon forget. I'll be back again soon, and I encourage anyone else to come here too! Trust me, it lives up to the hype!"}
{"text":"They have the best eggs Benedict and their variety always draws us back. They are kid friendly and if you go on weekdays, there is no wait time (from what we experienced). Good quality espresso drinks, too! We love trying \"pancake of the day\" - it's always a surprise in the flavor combinations in a pancake (like jalapeño and bacon inside). My husband loves their fresh housemade jelly to put on bread and their alcoholic beverages. I love that for a lot of dishes you can do a combo to try more than one dish, but in smaller quantities."}
