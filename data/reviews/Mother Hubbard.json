{"text":"Delicious! Friendly and quick service. Can't beat this place for a good value fish dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be our number one spot to stop for fish and chips when I used to live near scarborough, since then I only go in every so often but I am always satisfied when I walk out the door. The service in here is usually excellent, only at peak times are they sometimes overwhelmed as they are usually well staffed. The waitresses are always friendly and helpful. The interior decoration used to be very dated, but they recently gave the place a much needed makeover, which vastly improved the feel of the place, now it is an extremely pleasant place to eat. On to the food, I have tried a variety of different meals, and have always been happy with my selection, whether it be fish,sausage or otherwise. I would recommend this place to anyone really, the food is tasty, cheap, and the service is great, if you like this type of food, you won't go away disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all to stop at for a reasonably cheap and cheerful meal. Centrally located, so ideal as a stopping point after a day of browsing Scarboroughs not so extensive range of shops.    The food is as you'd expect from this kind of establishment - and each time I've eaten there its been more than acceptable. I'm not a fish eater, but people I;ve eaten with who have chosen the fish tell me its very nice. The chips are crisp and so benefit from not being too soggy and tasteless, and on the whole its fine. Nothing too special, but you wouldnt eat here if thats what you were looking for. Its competitively priced and the service is always good too.    Ideal for what it is, and one of the better fish restaurants in the town centre. Well worth a visit if you're looking for smething simple and quick."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  On entering I was greeted by a miserable blonde girl. The haddock was excellent, the chips were very average. I wanted some peas which I was charged an extra £1 for, first time I've had to pay for peas in a a restaurant. The peas hadn't been drained, full of water so would have made the fish and chips awful. When I went to pay at the till they tried to overcharge me for drinks I didn't order. I checked the bill prior as I could tell this would happen.   This place used to be good but now I won't bother."}
{"text":"It's been over 10 years since I was last here and will probably be the same again. It was very busy when I went in at about one in the afternoon. The two of us only just managed to get a seat. It was so hot in there and the staff were red faced and miserable. We both ordered the lunchtime special which consisted of medium haddock, chips, bread and butter, tea or coffee for £6.50. The waitress asked us if we liked mushy peas and we said yes. The bread came first which consisted of one slice of bread, cut in two, with a slight smear of old yellow stuff and a fingerhole through it !It was just slammed down on the table without a word. The fish was tasty but if it was medium I would need a magnifying glass to see the small size. It was tiny. The peas never turned up. Another waitress wandered over and added a chair to our table and walked off without a word. In all I found the service quick but the staff moody, miserable and rude. Of the 8 or so waitresses I observed I only saw one smile at her customers. When I came to pay I was charged for peas. I pointed out that I never ordered them and was just asked if I liked them and that they never came anyway. As I said the fish was good but I will get a better fish from a chippie at half the price. Never again"}
