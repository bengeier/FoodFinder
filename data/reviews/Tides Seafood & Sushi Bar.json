{"text":"I would NEVER return to this place.  Save your money and go to Long John Silver's, the food will be better.  Fish and chips were gross and greasy.  Sushi...well...calling that sushi is debatable. The prices were outrageous for the quality. (Higher priced than ANY other Sushi restaurant we've been to.) It appears that they cater to the players card group.  Save your time and more importantly, your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Would always make it a point to visit this place in the past but, unfortunately, no more.  Had the New Orleans Gumbo and a Rainbow Roll and neither was as good as last time I've been there maybe 6 months ago.  Recipe of gumbo must have changed cause its just not as good as I've previously had, and the sushi roll was lacking too.  Even the portions have gotten smaller and prices higher - double whammy for a restaurant that now serves so-so food vs previous good+."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 7, waitress named Emi, didn't want to write down any of our meal even though we offered to let her write it down. She came back and missed a ceasar salad and messed up one of the meals. When she brought the correct meal, it was absolutely disgusting and plain. We brought it up to Emi she said \"that's why I don't get the gumbo here\". Besides the fact she had absolutely no personality and was grumpy the whole time, she did not apologize or anything. She made an excuse. My rating is solely based on our server's personality and service."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner, but, was full after the bowl of New England Clam Chowder...Great flavor!  For dessert, ordered the bread pudding with vanilla sauce. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of cooked raisins and chocolate sauce, which were unadvertised adds.."}
{"text":"Interesting dinner. The sushi was decent. I also had a piece of cooked fish and mixed vegetables. The fish came out barely warm. I love vegetables. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat the ones that were served to me because they were soggy. They were gross. The waiter was friendly so it made dinner bearable."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience until today. Ordered a Cowboy Roll and Fish N Chips. 30 minutes passed no food. Asked our server where the food was. She said today seemed like \"sushi day\" and everyone was ordering sushi which backed up our order. Later, after 45 minutes of waiting, she said the printer didn't print out the ticket. She said she would get the manager. No manager ever came. We were offered ONE free desert. I don't think she ever told the manager. Oh and we were charged $3.00 per club soda. I was at a station casino on Friday and didn't get charged ANYTHING for a club soda at the bar, and I was not gaming. I'll think twice before coming back."}
{"text":"We live less than a mile away and elected to try Tides again, since we received a Station Casinos coupon for Tides. First off, the food is not too bad and we had no complaints. The bad news was our server. She failed to listen when we wanted to order our entrees, despite an appetizer order made at first. When she did return, she asked if I wanted a second beer, which I clearly told her yes. Well, 15 minutes elapse and I began to monitor our servers movements. It was no busier than most restaurants and I could sense that I was forgotten. I had to wave the hostess over. I advised that my drink never arrived and I had no water, despite my meal arriving. Despite my frustrations, I eventually let the server know when she asked if everything was ok. Now the excuses and attitude came out and all this did was to make me more frustrated. The Sous Chef was sent our way for my complaint. He was gracious and took my name and number, advising that he wanted us to be happy and return. He said I would be contacted. Three days later, no call.   BTW, I refused to use the coupon which would make this visit look like poor folks looking for a cheap meal.  Also, I have never made a restaurant complaint in my life and typically am forgiving if there is a sincere effort. In this case, I'm still steaming about the server's attitude and poor service."}
{"text":"Checked out this spot while i was in the area.  Very good food and service.  We had the following:  Shrimp Tempura - Nice presentation, tempura batter needed more flavor.  Kids Chicken Fingers and fries - Perfect, it looked like and tasted like they made the chicken fingers from scratch.  Cioppinno- MY friend had this and it was a hefty portion.  He enjoyed but the broth needed more flavor (seasoning, spices..etc)    Crab Roll - Nice dish...i ate the whole thing  Melon Martini - Sweet but strong and delicious. One more of these and i would of needed a ride.  Service was casual and friendly.  One complaint we had was we came specifically for the Crab legs but apparently they don't carry them anymore.  But when the Cioppinno arrived guess what once of the ingredients was.....CRAB LEGS!  We got a laugh out of this.  This is a refreshing option tucked away inside the Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular go-to places to eat for years now and I figured I should review it as we went again tonight. It is located in the Green Valley Casino next to the Poker Room. Great food. Service varies when they are really busy but a great atmosphere to hang out in. They also changed the menu about a year ago and took off some of the best dishes, (like the All-You-Can-Eat crab legs for $30 !!), but there is still enough good ones to pick from. Awesome sushi rolls but they can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten at tides restaurant in several months and enjoyed their boiled crab legs. We arrive tonight to find out that they no longer serve all you can eat crab legs and that the price of their pound and a half of crab legs had gone up significantly. Being still in the mood for crab legsand my wife ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. About three minutes after placing the order my crab legs came up but were slightly cool. Three minutes after that my wife plate showed up. I had to ask for my crab legs to be reheated as they had cooled waiting on my wife food to arrive. The waitress took her time to take our initial order and aside from delivering the food quickly we hardly saw her the rest of the night. We also had our daughter with us of one-year-old who needed a highchair. The first highchair that we were given had a clasp that was broken so we asked for a new one. The second highchair they brought was missing the clip entirely. The hostess said that she would help find us a new highchair. 10 minutes before the end of the meal the third high chair arrived. Station casinos believes in going beyond their best. Tonight was not beyond at their best.we most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious place for pan roast!! And the wait is not nearly as long as palace station. After coming to this kettle bar restaurant, it's not necessary to wait the hour and 15 mins in line at palace station. The gumbo and pan roast are both delicious. The Ribeye steak is also tasty and only $20. I can't think of another restaurant offers Ribeye for that price. And service is always quick and attentive. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Located inside the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino, we found this place was better than anticipated. In fact, we found it a suitable substitute for the Oyster Bar at Palace Station Casino without the long wait for a seat. Bigger location at Tides! The food and drinks were tasty and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Took my Mom here for Mother's Day. We didn't have a reservation, but fortunately there wasn't a wait. That was the only fortunate thing about our experience. There was a reason why this restaurant wasn't busy on a national holiday.  Food was of okay quality. It was overpriced seafood. What set my experience to a 1 star was the service. I work in customer service for a living. I've been doing it for 8 years now, so I'd like to think I know a thing or two. Our server was Troy and he sucked. At first if was okay, but the moment I asked for some Tabasco, I knew he was a horrible server. He took my request then passed our table twice. He served another table and when he noticed me watching him, he said \"your Tabasco.\" Like he forgot. He then took another 10 minutes to get my hot sauce to me. I could have gone to the empty chair by the sushi bar to grab a bottle I saw myself if I had known it would take me 15 minutes to get a bottle.  The icing on the cake though was when we placed an order for dessert. We were waiting for a while for it and actually talking about getting up & paying our tab at the cashier because it was taking so long. When he appeared. But instead of speaking to is about the delay he went to speak to the table next to us where we overheard him being so attentive to them. When he finally came to our table there was no apology. Just a simple \"here you are\" and walked away.  I felt he was discriminating against my family because we were not dressed as nicely as the other family. & perhaps it was because we were not white? Troy doesn't deserve to work as a server. He sucks. & I will never eat at this establishment because of the service my family was given. Which is why he didn't get a tip. Hopefully he takes that as a tip, or Tides does. Don't hire people like him."}
{"text":"The swordfish was par excellence! I get this whenever it's the fresh catch special of the day, and I wasn't disappointed.  The only reason I didn't give the entrée a 5 out of 5 was because the swordfish was paired with over-cooked rice. As a rice connoisseur, I can appreciate the patience of preparing rice that can yield both firmness and gelatinous simultaneously in these little grains of goodness. Sadly, the scoop served with this meaty fish-steak was too mushy. @Ohana4Mama"}
{"text":"Tides has a large selection of seafood, but we were in the mood for sushi and wanted a quick meal. So we took a seat at the sushi bar and ordered two rolls: a cowboy and a Tides roll.  Although the cowboy sounded better on paper, the Tides was actually the better of the two. It had crab, shrimp, and avocado, and was topped with a tasty ginger Sriracha mayo. The cowboy had spicy tuna and beef tenderloin, topped with thin jalapeno slices. We devoured them both, but they were really nothing special. And the sushi menu was somewhat limited, with no eel in sight.  The rest of the menu looked promising, particularly the seafood Cobb salad and the gumbo. And you can't go wrong with fresh, raw oysters. I just wish they offered oysters Rockefeller and a few more sushi selections.  I'm not often down in Henderson, but if I ever return to Green Valley Ranch, I might give Tides another try. But I think I'll steer clear of the sushi bar next time. Those hot dishes looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Chef Tulen is the very best!  He made me a healthy creation called a Virgin Roll w/ Salmon & Yellowtail.  If he's not there, I do not order sushi.  Also the Grilled Shrimp Tacos, three tacos full of cabbage & shrimp, I ask for no pico de gallo, add the Cholula & Chipotle mayo & wow!  Delish.    Jesse & Jenay are the best servers also.  Hardworking & always remember what you eat & drink.  I have to say when the three are there, it's like hitting the trifecta & the Sportsbook is located right behind.    Thank you!  You three I consider family & always look forward to seeing you."}
{"text":"Locals tend to be a loyal lot. Having eaten here for years, always enjoyed good, consistent food.  Locals also don't like being ripped off.  Hadn't been here in a few months, and was shocked at the revised menu - not only has it been drastically reduced in choices, but a lot of the prices dramatically increased. I understand if prices go up a dollar or two, but $6-$8-$10???  I don't care if the fish and chips changed from cod to haddock - a $7 price increase?  Lobster roll jumped $9 to $26 because it's now (supposedly) Maine fresh water lobster... sorry, there's not enough lobster in the sandwich to justify that kind of price increase.  This foolishness shows by how empty the restaurant was tonight. Used to have to always wait for seating.  Bad move Station's... how to close what was once a good place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants, probably eat there two to three times a month! Yummy and fresh seafood! All their entrees are amazing and guarantee you will almost always have left overs !"}
{"text":"I worked at GVR for three years, and when I wanted seafood after work, this was my go-to place.  Somehow, the food's gone from great to so-so.  It's not bad, but something's missing that I can't really put my finger on.  The portion size is good for the price and the service is as good as anywhere, but there's a certain something just not there I just can't put my finger on.  If you're in GVR and don't want to walk into the District to King's, this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Great food. Not great service. Being Italian I am critical of Italian dishes and the Shrimp Scampi and fresh oysters on the half shell were delicious! The service was not as much to rave about. There were 3 tables total along with three to four people at the bar total when we went in. We were seated and given bread then waited and waited to have our orders taken. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress checked on us once. We then waited and waited and waited (almost left) for our check and for my leftovers to be boxed up. My boyfriend had to stand up and pick up our bags for our waitress to come up. She may have been busy and I understand that but I do not understand the other waitress who walked past us repeatedly. Even though it was obvious we were trying to get someone's attention, she walked past without acknowledging us despite both of her tables having left. The experience would have been better had our waitress had more of a team supporting her."}
{"text":"The best New England clam chowder I've had outside I New England!  Plus prime rib and shrimp for $25, very good. Even the California rolls were really good. A total surprise in a casino/hotel...."}
{"text":"I'll be frank: my husband ordered sashimi and regurgitated it instantly into his plate (I'd never seen him do that before). The sashimi had a very strange texture. My son ordered the calamari, which was the color of mahogany, and tasted like old leather. I had a salad; it was acceptable. My clam chowder came right out of a can and tasted that way. We were appalled. The people around us, however, had huge plates full of tasteless mahogany deep-fried things and seemed happy. My standards are higher. I don't eat fast food. I don't eat mushy sushi. I don't eat cheap soup out of a can with tons additives. If you expect your food to be fresh and delicious, this is not the place for you. If you actually seek out good food, and can tell the difference, Tides is a nightmare."}
{"text":"I was extremely happy to try Tides because I knew they offered Pan Roast. Since it's a sister company to Palace Stations Oyster Bar I was excited and thought the wait would be shorter. We ordered as soon as we sat and got the crab cakes and shrimp pan roast. The crab cakes came out first, Im not sure how I feel about the sauce they used it was terrible but wasn't great. The pan roast felt like it took years to come out. They didn't give me an option of level of hotness. When it came out it wasn't very hot, a little on the cold side. There wasn't a lot of shrimp and wasn't as good as he oyster bars. Not sure if I'll come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food (I had the oysters, pan roast, and a Bloody Mary) ruined by crappy service. Waited 5+ minutes at the hostess stand while numerous servers walked past, saw me, and kept on walking. A simple \"the hostess will be right with you\" would have sufficed. The hostess looked miserable and bored out her mind. Once seated, the wait to be greeted by the server was also 5+ minutes (and this was consistent with all tables seated around me). The server did not introduce himself by name nor tried to make any type of conversation, menu tour, etc. All dishes and the check were dropped off to the table without a word spoken. Nothing about the type of oysters, the name of the dish, or even no \"please enjoy your meal\" or \"I will be your cashier whenever you're ready\". I was never checked on to see if my meal met my expectations (which it definitely did) or attempt to offer another alcoholic beverage.   Station casinos, please step your service game up!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We were served very tired and dry calamari the oil in the fryer should have been changed the day before. For $4 a piece we got  2 pieces of tuna from the bloodline portion of the tuna steak, the part we usually throw away. After looking at the reviews it seems that we made the mistake in thinking we could have a nice meal here. Obviously the negative reviews are correct."}
{"text":"Terrible management stands by the bar and watch's tv while staff is running around. Tony greeted us as we sat and said \"you don't even have menus yet\" AS WE SAT... seems like he had an attitude not professional. Sever was great and food was good."}
{"text":"Tides has great food and good service. I always eat there when I visit the casino. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hidden inside Green Valley Ranch Casino this very unassuming, coffee shop looking restaurant is quite a surprise. Seafood at reasonable prices with a friendly staff are the highlights of this hidden gem. It is Tucked away from the featured establishments like Hanks and Pizza Rock and is located by the casino's sports book. Try one of their pan roasts. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for my birthday.  We went for lunch around 2pm.  The prices were good.  The selection was good. Our waiter was nice enough but a bit lethargic.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant so I guess it was fine.  Zero personality.    Ordered Miso soup and the shrimp cocktail.  The shrimps were perfect though I did have to ask and wait for the cocktail sauce to be brought. 101 Shrimp COCKTAIL.   Miso soup, meh.   The decor could use a hit of color. Aquamarine perhaps.  They did offer a complementary dessert for my birthday that was Yum.  Are we in a hurry to go back? no."}
{"text":"A train wreck. We start with a tired, pokey and inattentive waitress. Then the beer I order from the menu is not available. Paid $18 for Charbroiled Oysters that are shriveled to the size of canned baby clams with no hint of butter or cheese that one would expect from a menu, proclaiming them \"New Orleans\" style. After an eternal wait, \"\"Sleepy\" our waitress finally returned to take our order. Wife is disgusted by now and just orders a shrimp tempura appetizer. Me, ever hopeful spins the wheel on a $24 bowl of gumbo. One half hour later, more disappoint conjoined with poor service arrive. Wife can only stomach two of the four shrimp as they are too dry and overcooked to be enjoyed. My gumbo is a bland, sludgy and over-riced mess, which makes me think that no one working in this place has ever been to New Orleans or tasted real gumbo. Stay away people!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the absolute worst service!  Not only did they make us wait 30 minutes for our table, when they clearly had two empty ones. It also took them 45 minutes to get our dinner out; they served us one person at a time,  so I was eating my dinner alone!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tides for 9 years and the service has never been that great but we do like some of their dishes. We ate here last Sunday and experienced the worst service ever! After sitting there for 25 minutes and ordering, we repeatedly asked for the bread basket which usually comes pretty quick. The guy, with no personality at all, finally gives us burnt bread.When we said we can't eat this, he took the loaf and in clear view threw it with such annoyance in the garbage.  We did ask for the manager and spoke with him. My shrimp scampi with linguine was OK but the pasta was too well done. I've eaten this several times here and it was much tastier. Really don't know if I would go back here again unless their food, service and staff improves. Too bad, it use to be very good! I'm surprised at GVR and it's F&B managers to have an inferior staff and restaurant at this nice local hotel. Won't be going back no time soon!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of times. It's okay for a seafood place. The oysters are good but the sushi is mediocre at best. Being from Maryland where seafood is to die for, maybe I am comparing them with this place. The service is okay, nothing special. The crab cakes were okay as well and nothing compared to what we get in the east coast. The calamari is okay and is good enough for 2-3 people as an appetizer."}
{"text":"This place is one of vegas' best kept secrets! I've been to palace station and waited the 1.5 hours plus for one of the 18 seats around the oyster bar for some pan roast, which I loved and all but to find this place without the wait and maybe possibly even taste a little better... Score!   I also liked that we could share the pan roast. It's a little too rich for me to eat the whole thing but to get a couple and some other things and share is perfect.   Everything we tried was delish and I would get again: Pan roast combo (lobster, crab, shrimp) Spicy pan roast (sausage, lobster, crab) Cajun shrimp (don't forget to dip your bread in the sauce)  Miso cod wraps  Everything had exceptional flavor, our waiting on that Sunday night was a sweetheart, and we all have an enjoyable time. I can wait to come back and try even more dishes!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I didn't know what to expect. We ordered the pan roast and Cajun grilled shrimp. I wasn't expecting much because I have tried really good seafood places and it's rare to find one in Las Vegas. However, the pan roast with the shrimp, crab and lobster has amazing flavor! Wow it even blew my friend away and she's from New Orleans, and she's very selective. She ordered the half portion and it was just the right size for her. Also my Cajun grilled shrimp was amazing. It had a lot more shrimp than I expected and it was grilled to perfection, the flavor was on point. It came with French fries and those were good too. The waitress was nice. Great food and can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"First I want to start of by saying I do not write reviews, in fact this is my first one! After the experience I had at Tides during a recent visit which was one of the best I've had in Vegas! I had to share. Not only was the food outstanding! linguini and clams and Manhattan chowder YUM!! But the service was beyond great! I am in the service industry myself and I would not say I'm picky..but very particular. Our server was Denise and boy is she on point! Even though it was a busy night for them she did not miss a beat! I can't wait to return and enjoy her pleasant demeanor, amazing service and some yummy food!"}
{"text":"I went at 5 and had no trouble getting seated. I had a bread basket brought over within the first five min. Waitress had gone over specils and favs within 10. I got crabcake appetizer which I would recommend. I had heard great things about the bread basket ... eh. Very chewy sour dough bread. It needed butter. I was not that hungry so got a half size portion of pan roast soup and it was huge. It had plenty of seafood. However the tomato base tasted like canned tomato soup. I would like to try a real dinner... looked good and were well pticed for what you got."}
{"text":"Inside the GVR green valley ranch hotel and casino, Tides restaurant food is average c+ cut back portion from previous year and increase in price like linguini with clam, they give 6 fresh clams filled with canned clams before you wouldn't see this, management fault, cut back and service is understaff but ok. When they have more than 5 tables going the service will suffer and waiting time is bad. Similar to Hanks Steakhouse, they used to sell Prime Steak , great then and now they use usda choice meat  and prices still increase. Station casinos is known for this practice. I would not recommend it in any of their (Station)Steakhouse. Prime steak at SW wynn Steakhouse close to price Green Valley Hank charge, you get real stuff at SW Steakhouse. First Class all the way at any of their restaurant, I remembered few years back when Mr. Wynn did not like Sinatra's presentation, hands on, he remodel it and hire new chef and boy what a difference it made. This is why he is a success. When mr. Wynn left the Bellagio, his once famous Steakhouse Prime went down the toilet. How one person can make a big difference."}
{"text":"Walking in we were told there was a 40 minute wait for the sushi bar. We decided to go gamble and have them text us when it was available. Cool except we received a text exactly ten minutes afterwards.   We decided to take our time and came back 30 minutes later. We were immediately seated and given menus. The waitress was extremely nice and sweet.   We both had glasses of wine. Ordered a salmon sushi roll, steamed mussels and raw oysters.   The sushi roll unfortunately was horrible. It makes me sad to say this but it's the worst sushi I've ever had. On the flip side the steamed mussels were to die for. I loved them and the tasty broth inside. We dipped our bread in the broth. The raw oysters were okay, not fantastic but not bad. The lady next to us was discussing her meal too with her husband. She had the fish tacos and only ate one of the three tacos because she said it didn't taste good. Of course the waitress offered to make them again but the lady said it's okay can we have the bill.   This visit left me feeling mediocre. I would only be back for the steamed mussels. I was in such a hurry to get out that I'm pretty sure I left my pink jacket there. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Had the place stop ourselves at 3pm....fish n chips (made from giant pieces of really good haddock) and a generous spicy tuna roll...excellent eats!!"}
{"text":"This place has hearty portions and the seafood tastes good.  We had some calamari that had a great tomato sauce with it.  Their pastas were heavy and had good flavor, but it wasn't enough to justify the prices, even if it's inside a casino."}
{"text":"Cajun shrimp with fries and shrimp scampi over pasta. Both were good. If you are already at the casino this is a good place to eat. I can't comment on the sushi. Beer on tap and house wine was also good."}
{"text":"Bad experience yesterday.  Ordered apps and food and they all came at the same time.  Not only that but the waitress dropped ketchup on me that went everywhere.  Now I know it was an honest mistake and she did feel bad but there was no attempt to make it right.  They could have offered to pay for cleaning my shirt and jeans - Nothing  Food was poor, cold and lacking taste.  Bill was $80 for 3 people and was not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is OK, but the seafood place in Sunset Station (Oyster Bar) is 100x better in nearly every way. The food tastes better, seafood is more fresh, the service is better, and the prices are cheaper. Being owned by station casinos I expected this place to be similar to Oyster Bar, but it was a far cry from it. Don't waste your time here, go the extra few miles to Sunset. I think they only main difference between it and the Sunset location is that they offer sushi, but I'll be honest, the sushi was not very good and was very over priced for what it was, so again, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"what's there not to like about this place? Sushi here is phenomenal and pan roast with rice on the side, stick with the half portion (I don't see much difference in size with the full portion but $7 difference)  Knocking off 1 stars for charging me $2 for extra bowl of rice. The portion is huge yet one scoop of rice, I should bring my own rice next time...overly salty if I eat it alone."}
{"text":"It's really a 3.5 rating but I bumped it up to 4 stars because the service and food was good enough for a return visit.   Got some Station Casino local coupons in the mail so off we went. Came here for a Sunday dinner. Restaurant was slow. Boyfriend and I shared a bowl of gumbo. We both ordered the blackened mahi mahi entrée with steamed broccoli and trinity rice as our entrée. (see photo attached). Pretty good portion for the price ($19.00)  Not sure if GVR have a casual café on property. If not, this place seems like it'll do the trick. It's very casual....not glitzy at all. You come here, eat your food, and you're off on your merry way.  It's located right next to the Sportsbook lounge. Very convenient from the outdoor parking lot also."}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day lunch here with wife and kids. We had Lump Crab Cocktail for an app, it was very good. We ordered several sushi rolls to share. They were all good and fresh. The service was ok, which is the reason for 3 stars, it wasn't overly busy so not really a reason for the service. It is a nice environment."}
{"text":"Here we go again!  I guess all good things must come to an end.  We came here on 9/6/15 and had a horrible experience. Then took a chance and came back tonight on 9/18/15.  On 9/6/15 (16:43) we started out with the worst server I've ever had here.  Her name was Nelia.  She was extremely difficult to understand.  Language barrier bigtime!  She was very rude when trying to take our order.  She wasn't paying much attention and even started walking away before we completed our order with her!  Very strange behavior.  So we managed to give her our order, which was Calamari for appetizer, Fish & Chips & Bowl or Clam Chowder.  Keep in mind....we come to eat here about once a week and it's always delicious.  Bus boy brings us bread....but we couldn't manage to get our soda's.  Finally after tracking down bus boy again...he brought our soda's.  We never even seen server (Nelia).  We sat in end booth we always sit in, which is on the far left when you walk in (Table 12)....so we could see when our Calamari was put up under heat light.  After at least 10 minutes of watching Calamari sit there....we thought that perhaps it was someone elses order.  Or I should say...we hoped it wasn't ours!  Nope....it was ours.  Here comes Nelia finally.  She brings it to the table and takes off instantly!  I knew by the looks of it....it was way over cooked and very dark.  Then here comes Nelia with our Bowl of Clam Chowder & Fish & Chips.  I told her this Calamari is very over cooked and you couldn't hardly chew it.  I said have the Gal at the Fryer cook it for half the time.  She said ok.  Now we're sitting here with our dinner and no appetizer before hand.  I look at my bowl of soup....and its about half full.  I get this soup all the time here....cause it's usually delicious!  So...I figured...forget it.  Not going to bother asking to fill my $8.00 bowl of soup up!  I proceeded to eat it....and it clearly was not fresh tasting....and there were no clams in it.  Just tiny little minced pieces.  So now I'm really getting irritated.  My husband's fish and chips were covered in so much oil it was disgusting.  He had a pool of oil on his plate.  It is never been like this before when we ate fish here.  Never!  It didn't even look nice on the plate either.  Just thrown on a plate with fries in the mix.  No tarter sauce or ketchup that always comes with it.  He said screw it...we waited long enough...I'm eating.  As we are STILL wasiting for our appetizer -Calamari!  After 15 more minutes...I'm DONE with my half bowl of soup....and there the Calamari sits under heat lamp again!!!!  And our server Nelia NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!  And we have empty soda glasses!  Finally my husband goes up to the counter and asks if thats our Calamari they re-made?  Another server walks by and she says Yes I think it is...here ya go!  He brings it back to the table.....it is even worse than the first time!  Not only is it burnt...there's oil all over it and under it!  I was so disgusted that I just wanted to get the check and leave!  I did notice that there was a gal cooking at the fryer station....where I usually see a man with a mustache at that cooking station every other time I come here.  First time I've seen this dark haired women \"cooking\" here.  Well let me tell you....she has no business working at this restaurant!  If she can't even fry food and present a decent looking plate....she should not be working here!!!!  I know very well what this food should look like and taste like.....because I usually get the same thing everytime!  And this was dispicable.  So....now we're waiting for our server Nelia again...to get our check.  I did see the Manager rush by briefly...but wasn't able to get his attention.  I usually see him almost everytime I'm there eating.  Not sure what his name is....but I believe he's an Asian man....who is very nice and always asks how our meal is.  Anyway....we ask the bus boy if he could tell our server we would like our check....finally Nelia arrives with our check.  She see's the uneaten Calamari and doesn't say a word....just walks away!  After that experience....I thought I'm going to take a break from coming here for a while...because something is seriously wrong with the food, female cook/fryer and server! NEXT REVIEW I'M POSTING IS FROM TONIGHT'S EXPERIENCE 12 DAYS LATER!"}
{"text":"Great food, featuring a selection of American, Italian and Japanese seafood. It's a little pricey, but coupons are frequently sent out in the mail.   The clam chowder is fantastic, as well as the etouffe."}
{"text":"So I have been going to Tides for years, wrote a great review and love the place so much my boyfriend took me there for my birthday yesterday. Good food, average service, nice atmosphere, then I saw it, a server, with long hair not pulled back by the way, is walking across the room with a damp wipe in her hand, she sneezes, into the wipe, drops it on the floor, picks it up and proceeds to wipe down three tables with it.  I was so dumbfounded I yelled, I then got the (I can only assumes) mgrs. attention, he came over, I was stuttering I was so upset, told him what happened and he smiled and said he didn't see it, I said I did and it happened.  He smiled and said he will talk to her, I said I will yelp and he laughed.  As I was leaving the server crossed my path, I said  \"what you did was disgusting!!\" she asked what, I said dropping the wipe then wiping the tables  not to mention the  sneeze, she still had it in her hand, she says \"oh I'm sorry \" she acknowledged that it happened,  That was it!!!! So I am scared to death that this is not uncommon practice, that I am the one that's out of line and that scares the hell out of me because is that the same wipe that wipes the edge of my plate I almost threw up.  I am from an area where seafood is prevalent, it is not here, I loved Tides for its oysters and crab but it will never happen again I have eaten many many many places and NEVER seen such a blatant disregard for sanitation. Shame on you for the training and the flippant attitude your staff has.  I gave it one star to get the attention of readers, it deserves no stars, it deserves a call to dirty dining, if this goes on right in front of us what on earth happens in the back?"}
{"text":"Arrived at GVR, kicked back in the room a bit and then realized that we needed to venture out for dinner. For tonight we didn't feel like leaving the resort grounds...so what to do. Some research led us to Tides. At first blush, I was a bit skeptical. Brightly lit, right off the casino floor, basic seating...it felt more like a diner (maybe sitting at the bar is the way to go)...but once the food started arriving, there was no looking back. Cajun hand-peel and eat shrimp, shrimp Louie salad, sushi rolls...oh yeah, we left satisfied with both quantity and quality served."}
{"text":"The sashimi are fresh and delicious with well presenting. Rib-eyes steak is great and atmosphere is quite comfortable."}
{"text":"Hashimoto's back better than ever.  Thank you for that special salad, reminds me of the old days at Sushi Sake.  Don't waste your time with any other sushi place, go see Hashimoto.  Go for the sushi stay for the ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service from Jan. Had a dozen Fanny Bay oysters that were fresh and tasty. Also ordered Sashimi Quarter, OUTSTANDING and very fresh. To top it off we also had a Rainbow Roll that was the best I have ever had. Highly recommend this spot in Green Valley Ranch Casino Resort."}
{"text":"The oysters on the half shell were swimming in ice cold water. They apparently were kept in an alien environment, preserved in ice water and returned to a shell when ordered, not shucked and served fresh.  Do not order. Very tasteless and disappointing.   We do not seek conflict at a restaurant, so this is our only way of informing the Management.  Our other courses, sea bass and etoufee and Cobb salad, were delicious."}
{"text":"My bride and I have been patronizing Tide's for nearly 10 years now. I must say, service is always on point and the food excellent. We happened to wonder in for sushi and clam chowder this evening, only to find that out son's best childhood friend ( Chef Chris Jacobsen) and as on duty. What a delight. He is always polite, respectful, and as I remember...has a PASSION for food. What I found charming this evening, was how he would interact with the customers and make suggestions about meals to try. I see him as a kid. A son that my bride and I help to raise since age 12. The Stations Family has a real winner in Chris. And of course you already know that. He has progressed up the ranks over his 15 year career with you. SUPER EVENING."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. They don't skimp on the seafood. However, the service has sucked both times we have come here."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome steak and shrimp dinner. BIG portion of steak and jumbo shrimp and reasonable price!! We had a wonderful dinner time. We will be back for delicious steak and shrimp!!   I really don't need to cook steak at home because they do a great job with very reasonable price!! Highly recommend this place for steak and seafood!!"}
{"text":"Good food, slow service. Good luck if they ever refill your drinks or water. Try sitting at the counter for slightly better service. I've been a customer many times and I constantly see patrons complaining to the manager, not exactly sure about what, but I can guess..."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times, and were reasonably happy, although most of the sushi rolls are unremarkable, and the service can be pretty slow. However, we recently ordered the 'Seafood Tower\" at $75. We got 3 Shrimp and 3 Oysters which were ok, 3 clams which were so fishy as to be inedible, A couple of crab claws, and some dried out inedible crab legs stuffed into the top that can't possibly have been for human consumption.  At $25, this would have been disappointing. At $75, this is an unbelievable rip-off, and reason enough to boycott Tides from now on. We have recommended this place to friends in the past, but we'll make sure to reach out to them and send them elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cannot believe not only how terrible the quality was the Server Star argued with me.  My husband and I left without eating.  I asked if the clams in the linguine and clams were fresh.  It sat in the window for ten minutes and when delivered it had canned clams with only 6 fresh clams thrown on top.  The rice on the sushi was not fresh, but old and hard. GROSS!"}
{"text":"The food was really awesome! However the service sucked, as a waitress, 8 tables and 3 servers we shouldn't have waited for anything, I asked for more water got a pitcher set by my glass, wanted to order a beer, but bender got the chance, had to yell at someone just to get my check."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my mom all the time. My all time favorite is the house roast. I never get anything else. It is just the best.   However, my recent visit completely changed my mind about Tide's. I am extremely busy and only had time to order take out instead of sit and order like I usually do. I was so excited to have dinner when I got home since I hadn't had Tide's in quite sometime. But when I opened my to go containers, I thought they had given me someone else's leftovers. I always always AWLAYS order a full order of the house roast. Same order this time with the pricey amount and all. Except, it looked like a smaller version of their half order.   Unless, Tide's has completely increased their prices and cut their portions in half, I'm NEVER going back. I'll only come back if I want this place to completely rip me off. See the pictures for yourself. Absolutely unacceptable Tide's."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tides since my boyfriend introduced me to it a couple years ago. Normally we sit at the bar (I don't think I have ever waited sitting at the bar) order some rolls for appetizers and then our entree.  I have tried multiple items from here but I keep coming back to their seafood combo pan roast. It is absolutely delicious. Me and my boyfriend fight for leftovers since the portions are huge. They have some other local spots that sell pan roast (the oyster bar) but this place is a hidden gem and very good and very comparable.  Service is decent - some of their regular servers are on top of it but I have sat there and listed to others complained about how horrible the service and food have been - I can't relate I've always had a good experience.   As far as drinks, bartending is not their strong suit. I'm picky with my cocktails and they always make it too strong for my liking. If you're the same like me, I would stick to wine or beer.   Other than that I recommend this place for a cute date night since the movie theater is just down the escalator!"}
{"text":"Tonights dinner was fast & tasty.   The peel & eat shrimp was messy but just the right blend of spices!"}
{"text":"The fish & chips are awesome!!!!!  I was a bit disappointed with the service...       We had a party of 5 and (3)-$15.00 off coupons valid Sunday - Thursday which would of been great except they put a valid only time frame on them that conveniently excludes normal dinner time hours (which is not a \"normal\" restriction Station Casinos puts on their coupons), we told our server we had coupons before we even ordered and she informed us they were not valid at this time, we mentioned talking to the manager, but did not peruse it as to not put a damper on the birthday celebration...       I decided to call the manager after stewing about it and they didn't even answer the phone, it rang about 20 times then disconnected me....  not a good P.R. move... that is why we invented voice mail or have the call roll back over to the hotel main desk... I cannot even find an email address for them...      I feel the server should of immediately brought the manager into the situation and either had him/her come talk to us about honoring the coupons or just got them \"pre\" approved and made everyone happy.... but she didn't...... and now I am yelping great food - bad service..... you need good service in order to succeed in the restaurant business, not just great food alone...."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night. Great service and great food. Had the clam chowder & some calamari. I will be back to try some of there other dishes. I love seafood!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Tides in quite a while and needed a break from our norm at Green Valley Ranch for meal choices. Pleasantly surprised with how fresh and flavorful the entire meal was, nothing to complain about. I normally have some grilled fish but decided the Southern Fried Shrimp sounded particularly good. Shrimp was cleaned perfectly and had a light, well seasoned batter. Cole slaw was mediocre but fries were skin on and not greasy at all. Had a side Caesar salad which was plenty for two people to share, generous portions all around. My mate had New England Clam Chowder and he cleaned the bowl. We will be back again sooner and hope to see our attentive waitress, Liza. Good solid seafood at very affordable prices."}
{"text":"I came here only because they're same company with Palace Station casino. I loved the cajun shrimp at the famous Oyster bar at PS so I expected to get similar taste at Tides. Its so disappointing that what I got was totally different flavor, not even close. I wonder why the chef at PS can't train the chef at Tides to make the same taste???My server didn't even ask the spicy level I want, didn't bother to give me more information like \" The wait will be 15', you can come back later\". She let me standing there waiting for nothing like a dumb bc I didn't have a chance to ask her how long for the wait. The reason I give it 2 stars is for the other server who was way nicer than my server. Still left her few buck for my to-go order even though I didn't think she deserves it."}
{"text":"I had a few dining offers from Green Valley Ranch so decided to check this place out a couple times. Considering it's a sushi spot in a casino (or its classy name: casino sushi) it's not bad. It's not the best sushi I've ever had but casino sushi here is way better than its cousin: convenience store sushi. Bleh  I particularly enjoy the Ocean Paradise - shrimp tempura with ahi, avocado topped with crab and sprouts - and the White Lotus - shrimp tempura wrapped with asparagus and avocado topped with albacore. Both of those were good enough that I ordered them multiple times!  I haven't tried any of the other seafood dishes there but the oyster tower looks fun!  The closest entrance to Tides is through the Paseo Verde parking lot/garage so if you don't want to navigate through the table games and slot machines, park there!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain  awful. The service was slow and rude. The clam chowder was so thick that I could stick my spoon in straight up and it wouldn't fall.  The main dish I ordered was Bouillabaisse, it was so salty that it was like licking a bullion cube and when I sent it back the manager on duty didn't even check with us, and ignored us completely. The food is over priced slop. I will never go back."}
{"text":"If you know & are used to good sushi rolls, do not dine here. The rolls barely had any flavor. My boyfriend ordered the rib-eye and was also not impressed. I do like the ambiance, considering right next to the sports book. We will not dine here again."}
{"text":"Sub par at best. I went friday the 2nd of October for dinner around 6pm and sat the front right by the sushi but to the left. We had a latina server that never smiled once and seemed upset to be making $ off bringing people food. It was a chore for her to bring stuff and had very little knowledge of full bar and what types of liquor they served. The soft shell crab sushi was ok and Cioppino was the highlight of a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a million times and it's always delicious. Service is always excellent, even when they're super busy. I love the fish tacos and they serve it with this sauce that's so delicious! It's like a chipotle garlic sauce that just goes so well with everything! The sushi is always great as well. Wet n wild is one of my fave rolls. It's mostly just spicy tuna with tuna on top paired with a garlic ponzu sauce."}
{"text":"There is no longer steak on the menu. If you don't eat seafood, your only option is a chicken sandwich. The sushi was mediocre and the seafood dish ordered was left Half uneaten. The atmosphere isn't very comfortable. The service was very very slow, although it was a half off Wednesday"}
{"text":"Lobster roll is disappointing! Been here many times before, and have never seen lobster look like a pile of mush... It was sitting for 10 minutes under heat lamps in addition to being mushy... I won't be back. The service was also half assed. The manager did not even come over to apologize despite being present.."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place based on 3 stars but I'm glad I did. So far all the sushi that I have tried has been really good quality  sushi with great flavor. This place is always busy when I would walk bye, now I know why. The service was not  bad but its also 10pm at night. Lots of  people watching and It's located next to the poker room."}
{"text":"Loved the pink elephant sushi. You get a big portion. Server was nice and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"They food was very good. . . Once they got it right. I ordered a ribeye medium rare and it came out over cooked a small. They apologized and brought me back a way better steak! Lol then the brought rice when i ordered fries. They brought a whole bowl of frues to fix the situation. The pan roast was definitely a must and definitely get tge spicy crisp green beans BOMB"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at The Tides, their New England Clam chowder never disappoints. I had a Fish and Chips and my husband Randy had the Pan Roast. All was delicious, and as always, Annie is very friendly! They now serve sushi which is a plus for me as I don't like sushi but my husband loves it, so now he can enjoy his sushi while I have Fish and Chips or a Lobster Roll. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Yummy! This place is great! All the staff is very happy & fast! Me & my friend sat at the bar, we ordered a Cesar salad, sushi, & pan roast. Very delicious with a lot of flavor. Big portions and their bread is fresh, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Our server Emi was terrible, slow at bringing us drinks or filling water. She forgot to bring us salads then trying to bring them to us after are entree. Brought me the wrong dinner, then had to wait a long time to bring the Gumbo I ordered. To top it all off the Gumbo was terrible!"}
{"text":"We are locals 5 minutes from Green Valley Ranch Resort where the Tides is located.  We eat out every day and sometimes twice a day.  We spend substantial amounts of time at the GVR Casino and the restaurants there.   For some reason we have never eaten at Tides, so we went today, at 12:00PM, for lunch before a movie.  We sat at a table at 12PM.  It took an unusual amount of time for someone to approach us and offer water.  Bread arrived at 12:15.  We had eaten all the bread and still no server.  At long last a server arrived and we already had our order ready to go. From the time Anne took our order until the time we chased Anne down, asked for the appetizer check and left at 12:47 we had not received our lunch order, our water had not been refilled even once and we were left sitting for almost an hour simply waiting.  Come on guys!  This was lunch - a meal that should be available, efficient and able to be served and eaten in under an hour.  Something is very wrong with the Tides and it was not Anne our server.  There is a staffing issue with service and the kitchen was asleep or terribly overworked.  Consequently  after almost an hour, we never did get our lunch.  We had never eaten at the Tides, and now we never will.    There is no excuse for horrible inattentive lax inefficient understaffed service.  The manager should be ashamed of his management. This is an example of a restaurant that really doesn't care about its customers.  We'll let our host know of the poor service and hopefully management will read this review.  We would be happy to discuss it with them.  In good conscience, on the basis of service alone and customer care that is abominable, we cannot commend the Tides to you."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED  This review is based upon dining here about six times during the course of the last year, most recently on 7/19/16 and 7/21/16:  The Tides Seafood & Ocean Bar serves a wide variety of Sushi and Special Rolls, several seafood stews, raw Clams and Oysters and, indeed, as one reviewer pointed out, even steak.  While I stayed at Green Valley Ranch for the first time last week I always play video poker there when I visit Vegas and have generally eaten at Tides during the past several visits.  On those prior visits, I have been thoroughly impressed by delicious seafood stews such as the Pan Roast. It has been flavorful, moist and loaded with seafood. I would not hesitate to order the Gumbo or Cioppino in the future based upon how much I've enjoyed the Pan Roast.  On 7/19/16 I lunched here. My female server was terrific. She was polite and conscientious, checking back several times to see if I needed anything. The nice manager(?)n in chef garb chatted me up on both visits when he noticed my Yankee cap, since he told me he was a big fan and a Bronx emigree.  On my first visit(7/19), I chose the Linguine with White Clam Sauce. Although it was a nice-sized portion with a fair amount of clams, I did not care for the sauce, which seemed more like a roux, than a hearty olive oil-based sauce which I prefer. My Gordon Biersch Pilsner, however, was delicious, cold and fabulous.  On my second visit (7/21), I chose the Jambalaya. It was offered as a special for the first time. I loved it. It was laced with an ample amount of chicken, shrimp and andouille sausage. I liked that it was seasoned modestly so that I could adjust the heat as I like with Tabasco.....and I like it hot. I washed it down with another delicious Gordon.  I look forward to dining at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place ain't that great.  Ordered a dozen oysters, half Kumamoto and half Fanny Bays.  When the order came out, waitress told us that they ran out of Fanny Bays, so they substituted oysters from Mexico.   Nice of  her to let me know and actually ask if I wanted them.   While the oysters were edible, they weren't completely fresh.    For entrees we ordered:  steak and lobster, ribeye steak, and pan roast with all three shellfish (crab shrimp and lobster).   Unfortunately you can actually cook whatever supermarket steaks better at home.   The ribeye was chewy and fatty.   On the pan roast they forgot the lobster.    I will say that our waitress was very friendly and seemed to have the best intentions. But things just weren't quite right in this place."}
{"text":"This my favorite,  place this is were i come every coyple weeks the service great, the food is so fresh , its AMAZING MUST TRY ."}
{"text":"I was hoping for more from this place.  The service is definitely as slow as stated in all the other reviews.  The food is hit and miss.  I had the grilled Ahi Tuna that was burnt on the bottom but still mostly juicy, but overall was not satisfying.  A friend got the Pan Sear lobster that was delicious and we all split a tempura roll that was excellent.  The service was the biggest bummer at this place, I think they are understaffed because our waitress was super busy, but never had enough time to refill my empty water the entire visit.  It also took forever to get food.  Also, when we sat down the table was dirty and had no silverware, which meant that it was not properly set up for us after waiting 30 minutes for the table."}
{"text":"Really cool place!! Great food!!! Service is prompt and spot on!!! Go go go!!! I had clam chowder shrimp and steak!!! My hostess Anthony hooked up with comp!!!  Yeppers!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. For a Wednesday night, I came here for a light and fresh option. I always order the cobb salad with white french dressing which is yummy. Then my light and fresh option is a fish platter, Mahi Mahi with Trinity rice. It is always cooked to perfection including the broccoli. It's always a delicious meal. This is my perfect balanced meal. It was very quiet, but do not let this discourage you because the service is always nice and friendly. My other favorites is the Caesar salad with a side of grilled mahi mahi or Salmon, Sushi Quartet and the Pan Roast with seafood mixed."}
{"text":"Really good sushi! Friendly service. Had no idea this place was that good. Next time I'm going for the San Francisco styled stew. Very clean and easy to find a seat."}
{"text":"Ok! I was craving charbroiled oysters for like a week but i couldn't decide on a place to go. I completely forgot Green Valley had this place. My kids and i ordered a mixture of charbroiled oysters and raw oyster. They were delicious.  My only problem with it was i would've liked the cheese on top of my oysters to be browned. And there was a couple of broken shards of oyster shells in almost all of my oysters which made it hard to eat. We also ordered the shrimp scampi but i felt like it wasnt enough shrimp. It was only 3 pieces. I also got the fish tacos. The fish was cooked perfectly and nice golden crisp! I wouldnt get fish and chips next time. It was expensive about 100 bucks for the 3 of us. Well that is probably because we ordered 3 rounds of oysters(57$). We just couldnt get enough. I wouldve gave this place 5 stars but the shell shards was my biggest problem."}
{"text":"Went in for fish Friday. Cute hostess in a peplum dress sat us at the busy bar where we were served a complimentary bread basket. Our server was Liza but she was slammed and didn't know she had us or was going to get to us? I'm not sure but we were hungry so I took matters into my own hands. I placed our order in through Matt (?) and 5 minutes later the dishes arrived in front of us. Fish n Chips 3/5. Slaw was fantastic. Good pieces of fish, equal parts breading, and they give you lemon slices. Nothing special though. I had the New Orleans gumbo (half portion) and it was delicious! I had to refrain from licking the plate clean but it is the perfect portion. Filling but not so much that I was uncomfortable. Definitely a 5/5! Only thing I didn't like about my experience was being handed the check while we were still eating. Dessert wine? Well not now! Trendy setup they have, super cozy and pushed back a little bit from the casino. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Establishment is clean and modern. Hostess was friendly. Comfortable tables. Wide selection of seafood as well as sushi. Beer reasonably priced. Server was polite and friendly. Very good food. If you're a chowder fan, the clam  chowder is a must!  All in all, great experience; I'll be back.  P.S. for members of the GVR Players Club, there are some great coupons available which are sent in mailers. Saved us 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Located in Green Valley Ranch Casino. The service is OK, there have been times where I sat at my table and watched server after server walk by, and give me a 'that's not my station' look, as I tried to get their attention. If you can last past the less than stellar service, the food is quite good. So the long and the short of it, great food, OK service. Not a perfect combination, but for that lobster roll, I'll suffer. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Server was pretty special in that he had a flat affect and didn't seem to be happy to be there.  We did get the food and drink we wanted, though.  We were seated right away and got a divine warm sour dough roll with butter. Enjoyed that a lot. This time got the miso soup that had quite a bit of wakame and little tofu squared. Happy it wasn't overly salty. My rainbow roll was rice moist, maintained its shape and was lusciously filled with avocado. Can't believe I could taste the seaweed sheet and avocado.  Pal had the cajun catfish with 2 scoops of fluffy white rice. Instead of brocolli, he substituted it with large asparagus. He really enjoyed this plate."}
{"text":"My husband and I actually really enjoy the sushi here, but the service is consistently bad. This location is really convenient for us since we live in the area.   I'll start with the food because that is the good part about this restaurant. The oysters rockefeller are tasty and have a nice balance of flavor. We like the Cowboy Roll (spicy tuna with tenderloin and jalapeno) and Tides Roll (spicy crab, avacado, shrimp, and ginger mayo). I gravitate toward sushi rolls with sauces other than eel sauce so the entire menu here really appeals to me.  The downer here is the service. It's not friendly and it's really slow. It takes a long time to get food even when they only have a few tables. One time my water tasted like chlorine, but the waitress never stopped long enough for me to tell her."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the lobster roll and came back twice for the skinny dip roll! I'm in love with that roll ! Awesome service. Everyone is SUPER FRIENDLY and the food tastes super fresh. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"My husband took me out for a date night and Tides Seafood Bar & Grill didn't disappoint us. We had fried clams and clam chowder soup as starters, amazing! Then he had Linguini and clams and I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It was delicious! Although we were too full for desert we finished with some hot tea! We'll be back"}
{"text":"Food was great! Friendly staff. I got the SMACK sushi roll and it was delicious. My mom got the beer battered fried shrimp and my aunt got the salmon. All the dishes were great and I was told the fish and shrimp tacos are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe this place tucked way in the corner next to the sports bar in the GVR hotel and casino has in my opinion one of the best Cioppino sauces I have ever had. AND at half the price of most other restaurants that offer it on their  menu. Sit at the counter and enjoy watching them prepare Sushi dishes, plus you will get much better service, as it seems to be very spotty at times and you get the feeling that they are understaffed. A fully stocked bar makes the wait even better. We continue to enjoy coming here at least once a week. If your not in a hurry, give it a try. Ciao"}
{"text":"I was just here yesterday and not only was there no wait, the service was fast! The place was designed perfectly that you get enough space and not overbearing to overhear people's conversations! I got the bouillabaisse and it was delicious!!!!! Even just on its own without the rice it was just perfect! Will definitely bring more friends over to eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I again shared a pound of Cajun peel and eat shrimp for lunch as well as a soft shell crab.  The latter was very large, but suffered from way too much batter so there was little taste other than that provided by the dipping sauce.  The shrimp were no doubt raised in a 3rd world country, but the accompanying sauce was so darn good that you try not to think too much about it. A rating of 2.5 is appropriate."}
{"text":"Located at the fantastic Green Valley Ranch  Spa,Hotel, and Casino..... Small menu, large portions,  The sushi rolls are excellent. Entree salads are large enough for 2. The fish & chips were very good, came with homemade coleslaw & fries Service was a bit spotty and rushed. The place was not busy when we visited either. Good place if you want to grab great sushi and a drink"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 3 stars due to the fact that they reserve seating at the bar on busy days. I can understand tables although tables remained empty the whole time we were there to eat. Loss of revenue turning away folks that are there in front of you. The foods good, the service is decent, but put a stop to reserving bar seats."}
{"text":"So I'm a big big foodie and I'm telling you RIGHT NOW. Go to palace stations oyster bar for gumbo, pan roast etc.   I do give tide a 5 out of 5 for the sushi.  It's very fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Recently ate Tides with its new, expanded menu.  For some reason, the original Yelp page indicates it was \"renovated,\" which is not the case.  But, a new review was in order anyway, as there are some new menu items available.  I had dinner at Tides on a Sunday with a dozen or so people.  I made a reservation due to the number, and our table was ready right at arrival.  We had some of the new appetizers including oysters Rockefeller and fried calamari.  The oysters were fantastic, but what isn't good when baked with garlic butter and cheese?  The calamari appetizer is very shareable, it's quite large.  The sauce was pretty pedestrian, but the breading was light and crunchy and not greasy at all.  Everyone liked it.  To eat, I went with what I always get:  house gumbo, spice level 7.  I don't know if under the new menu they still prepare gumbo using the \"spice level\" system, but old habits die hard I suppose.  That used to be spicy, so that's how I order it.  The full gumbo is LARGE, so be advised.  I also only get one scoop of rice, I never finish both and prefer the actual gumbo anyway.  House gumbo has all three types of shellfish:  shrimp, lobster, and crab.  The roux is a nice dark color, thick, but not overly so.  The flavor is fantastic.  If I've ordered this once I've ordered it 100 times and rarely, if ever, has it disappointed.  The only problem on this visit was we had so many orders that people's food got mixed up.  Mine was not nearly as spicy as usual, but another diner's was way too hot for him.  But, like I said, we had a large group, and when that many people order gumbo at once, it's a strain on the restaurant.  So, we understood.  Service is typically good, but they can get busy, so be advised during high peak hours.  They've got a decent bar and it looks like they've added some new mixed drinks, although I didn't partake.  Can't recommend this place enough, my wife and I went a lot when we lived here, and now that I am in Oklahoma, I come for dinner when I travel back to Vegas."}
{"text":"If it could take more than 30 minutes to serve raw oysters, we might as well have drove to the ocean!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tides tonite for the first time. I had the shrimp scampi and linguini and my husband had the fish and chips. Both were very good. My only complaint was that after we ordered, we noticed that every other table had a basket of bread on it. We waited and waited, but never got one. When the server finally brought our food I asked her why never got our bread basket. She replied that you have to ask for it. She told us that she used to offer bread to the diners, but got yelled at by the management for doing that! I asked her how were we supposed to know that we had to \"special order\" bread since it was our first time there. I asked her if aomewhere on the menu it said \"bread by special request only\" and she said no. She finally said \"do you want some bread?\". We said we did. The bread finally came when our dinner plates were empty! What is the thinking behind the bread basket? Trying to save a few pennies, GVR?? I urge everyone that goes there to ask for a bread basket whether you want it or not!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. This time was terrible.  The food just wasn't very good. Maybe the real chef was off. I ordered cioppino and I got fish in tomato paste.  The dish should be simmered in a flavorful red based sauce with wine. My wife ordered mussels in white wine and what she got was super salty. The server never brought my drink.  I asked twice, then gave up. We had a table of 10 and it was a birthday.  They forgot the cake.  No, really. I have never left a bad food review, so here it is.  Somehow I don't feel any better.  I'm not coming back.  I'm going to go grab a hamburger just to get the taste out of mouth."}
{"text":"Idk why this place has such terrible reviews.... Best service I've ever had in a while! Our food came out so quick and the appetizers and our food came out separately at perfect time increments. Our waters were filled every 10-15 minutes and we were constantly checked on!  The food was phenomenal. We got the crab shrimp and lobster pan roast which is huge, so we split a normal portion between 2 of us. It was soooo filling we couldn't finish. We got the clam chowder which was good but watery which is weird, I wasn't a fan. The lump crab cocktail is so large and so yummy with the atomic horseradish. The oysters were watery too which was weird but so good and priced reasonably.   The interior is so gorgeous! I felt like I was in the little mermaid all over again. I will definitely be back to try the crazy yummy sushi rolls since this was a solely seafood only visit."}
{"text":"Their oysters are a must have when coming here! They are super fresh and delicious! The best oysters I have had! I also tried the shrimp scampi which I would say is pretty yummy. I don't even like pasta!   Their alcoholic beverages, ehhh not the best so I would steer clear of that.   Customer service isn't too bad given that they don't have that many waiters working so cut them some slack on that.   Overall I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"It is an airy well lit venue with a combination of bar stool counter seating and tables. Menu is ok with some good choices and prices are what you'd expect in a casino venue. Service was okay and the place is somewhat noisy. There are better choices in the Stations lineup like at Sunset."}
{"text":"The good here is consistently good for the most part, and the prices are reasonable. They do, however need more servers. When I went, I believe there was one server working the entire restaurant.  The pan bake is excellent. It's my go to meal here. I was disappointed with the calamari appetizer- it tasted good, but for the most part, it was one massive clump and we had to break it up. Since it wasn't broken up prior to frying, some squid got over cooked a bit.  Fish and chips is also consistently good. If anything, the breading is a little bland, but the fish and fries are both tasty."}
{"text":"This place has just gone down hill.  Prices gone up, selections have gone down.  I used to come here for the infamous Pan Roast.  The new menu now only allows one large size instead of having 2 sizes and its $27. This a rip off. Oh and they charge $5 for split bowl fees if you ask for an extra bowl to share with someone.   They also discontinued the steak and shrimp order, I used to get that for $25. They discontinued that and make you order the rib eye steak only for now $28, used to be $20. That's a $8 increase.    I also ordered the clam linguini which is the same size as the Pan Roast for $15 (better value of compared to pan roast) but it had so much dirt on the clams that every bite was a nasty crunch. Continuing eating dirt will cause kidney stones, so steer away."}
{"text":"Reservations were made in advance for two couples. We entered Tides to a vertically empty restaurant save for two people seated at a table. The hostess took us to a table virtually touching the only occupied table in the restaurant . She was perturbed when we asked for a table in another area.  She had to get permission from a waitress to seat us elsewhere . Not a  good experience .   I had  Manhattan clam chowder which was tasty. My shrimp scampi had four shrimp and ample pasta. They lost us at the door."}
{"text":"I had zero expectations of this place and no  knowledge of the menu before sitting down to eat.  I had the little man with me and there was a ramp in back so I had no problem parking the stroller in the restaurant.  Okay now onto the food, I sat down to a basket of hot sourdough bread and large crispy flatbread.  I was happily surprised by the wide variety of the menu. All seafood everything! From crabmeat cocktail to sushi to gumbo to grilled fish. We ordered clam chowder, crab meat cocktail, tempura green beans, Caesar salad, and grilled halibut. The tempura green beans were beyond addictive and I would definitely reorder. The salad was delicious and the crab meat cocktail was ice cold and hard not to horde all to myself. The clam chowder was good. Not the best I've ever had but still thick and creamy and enjoyable. The halibut was a little dry and could have used some sauce to liven it up.  Overall, it was a solid spot and I will definitely be back to try the pan roast and eat my weight in the awesome sour dough."}
{"text":"Tides is a solid oyster bar in Green Valley Ranch also offering pan roasts, seafood entrees, and the recent addition of sushi. We can count on a delicious meal there, but the service on occasion has not been as reliable.  The restaurant is open with plenty of bar seating, booths, and tables which usually never equates to having a wait, even on the weekends. But sometimes it equates to the servers getting overwhelmed. The openness can also lead to noise trickling in from the nearby sports book and casino.   I will say that the food has always been delicious for us. We always enjoy the oysters. Ask your server for other selections they may carrying at the time. They'll be a little pricier, but a nice change from the traditional Blue Points they usually serve. On our most recent visit, we ordered a dozen Kumamotos ($24) and a half dozen Fanny Bays ($17) which were freshly shucked and delicious. For entrees, my wife loved her shrimp tacos and my bouillabaisse was served nice and hot with plenty of large chunks of seafood. The saffron added a nice aroma and a flavor that wasn't overpowering.  I can't speak for the sushi, but browsing the menu, I didn't see anything unique and worth ordering with everything being on the pricier side. Service from Denise was excellent. She was very friendly, always present, and there were no significant waits throughout the meal. But as mentioned before, we've had some not so stellar service in the past with extended waits and incorrect orders.  In the Green Valley Ranch/District area, Tides is the best option you have for seafood in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the spider roll n a few others to try out the sushi and was not disappointed. Fresh and pretty tasty, not too heavy on the rice in the roll either. Had the The gelled mahi for dinner and took the catfish home for later. The service was great, Liza stayed on top of everything and helped make the experience one to relish. Seemed to get there right before the rush and was delighted to get a seat at the sushi bar to observe how efficient the crew was while working to mAke all the magic happen. Great atmosphere and very helpful and friendly staff, would recommend to anyone that has second guessed or is unsure. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"We are definitely fans!  Tried this place because I saw that they have pan roasts like the other station casino near the strip.  Found out it is the exact same recipe so no more waiting for hours just to eat a pan roast.  My husband and I shared steamed littleneck clams which were okay but we came for the pan roast and we were not disappointed.  First, no waiting in line.  Second, you can order a half order.  Third, you get sourdough loaves and lavosh.  Fourth, you can sit at regular table vs. a table with bar stools.  Fifth, no long waiting.  I was a little reluctant after reading previous reviews about the service, but we had no problems.  Our waitress was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos #4 should have got $5!!! Thank you Crystal the best waitress @ Green Valley."}
{"text":"Gross!!!! Went tonight and made the mistake of ordering a ribeye steak. My meal came with a steak knife with the blade tucked under my steak. When I grabbed the knife, I felt something hard and crusty on the handle. It looked like several dried boogars - no joke. I looked at the blade and it has some unknown, sticky substance all over it. And again, this was touching my food! I brought it to the attention of the manager, who brought me a new steak and a new knife - this time, a clean one minus snot and boogars. The steak was atrocious! Tuff as leather and loaded with gristle. I could only eat about a quarter of it because it had so much gristle.   The service is a joke also. Long, long waits for everything.  Horrible and disgusting place with bad, bad service!"}
{"text":"Sever came by and told us that they closed in 3min so we needed to order right that second or leave. So we left On the way out we saw her saying the same thing to every other table. You are in a casino on a Fri night and you don't have hours posted and you turn away at least a dozen paying customers because you want to leave early?!"}
{"text":"2 stars because Liza was pleasant and food came out the second it was done. Sushi chef (we were sitting right in front of him) ignored us but thankfully Liza took our order.  Crab cake - great! Crab cocktail - great!  Sushi - horrible! (Ponzu sauce not good, too much vinegar in rice, ginger WAY too overwhelming ...you could smell it sitting next to the person eating the roll..husband loves sushi, could not finish either of the 2 rolls he ordered. (On average, he eats 4 rolls a sitting even if it's mediocre) Cucumber martini - not good at all ( and we love cucumbers and alcohol )  Bottom line - order miso soup and crab cakes and forget the sushi. Order straight liquor on the rocks. Or go somewhere else so you don't spend $100+ on good that is not worth it."}
{"text":"The Pan Roast combo was really good. The broth is creamy and full of flavor. I will be coming back to sample their other menu selection. The server was attentive and the service was good."}
{"text":"Service was very, very, very, very lacking.  Gave up and went next door to the Sports Bar for drinks. Restaurant only half full. Took 45 minutes to take dinner order. Took another 45 minutes for Oyster appetizer to come out.  And the food? Maybe they delivered it to China???"}
{"text":"I had to seafood gumbo which included Lobster shrimp crab and other delicious things I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"On our last two trips here we have found it to be inconsistent and recently very rude wait staff.   Last time we were here my entree was inedible.  My salmon was dry as a bone and the tomato caper sauce looked and tasted like it had been sitting around for quite some time.  Not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I let it slide.  That was probably my mistake and I probably would not have returned but we were invited to dinner last night.   4 of us arrived and were seated immediately.  So far so good.    We ordered calamari and California Roll as appetizers. The calamari was chewy and it came with some horrible tomato sauce. No one liked it so we asked for regular cocktail sauce which wasn't much better. Certainly lacking in horseradish. Then we waited forever to get our California Roll. We waited so long we finally told the waitress to forget it but she said it was ready. Ok, fine...but then we waited another 20 minutes!! Service could not have been slower.   My sister-in-law ordered crab legs for her entree...but nope...they don't offer them anymore???  What?  A seafood restaurant with no crab legs?  I opted for the Pan Roast but didn't want tomato sauce on it. Was told that was not an option!  Really?  Could the waitress offered to at least serve it on the side?  She said I should order something else!!!!  So I then chose Scampi but said I preferred angel hair to linguini...nope...not available!  What?  How hard would it be to accommodate a pasta option or two?    I finally opted for the fish and chips which were nothing to write home about. Seems the quality of the food has gone downhill.   My sister-in-law ordered a second drink which never came until we reminded the waitress again.    We used to love this place...not so much anymore.  I think we'll take our seafood dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Showed up because we wanted to try something new. Busier slams bread down disrespectfully and does a speed walk, waitress had a terrible memory. Kept forgetting to bring our drinks out, soy sauce twice so we had to grab one from a table where guests were done eating, guy making the sushi picked his nose and over 15 minutes to get our check and the place is pretty dead so what's the excuse for the shit service?"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to find lobster rolls, etc. that taste like lobster? I love a good lobster roll and was hoping to find it here. Mine was fine but lacking in lobster flavor. Maybe they didn't season the lobster? The menu has a nice variety of seafood offerings including gumbo and fried oysters. My dining partner had those oysters & I tried one, it was pretty good.  The ambiance of the place is pretty nice. It's a very open restaurant with views of the sports bet area and also the adjacent casino floor. The prices are a bit high but considering it's GVR, this is not a surprise. There's a bar area that serves oysters and sushi too. They also have a few dessert offerings."}
{"text":"I was craving a lobster roll so stopped in for lunch. It wasn't busy at all so we were sat quickly at our choice of tables. Our male served was less than friendly and didn't seem too interested in doing his job.   We started with the New England clam chowder. Our server brought the soup but didn't bring a spoon. We had to get one from the hostess. It was really bland and almost a\"pasty\" type texture. Would not order it again.   I ordered my lobster roll and my friend ordered the crab cake sliders. He asked the waiter if they were good and he said they were. The food came out pretty quickly. My lobster roll was okay, but the filling seemed pre-made and was in a heavy mayonnaise based sauce, instead of chunks of lobster. The fries were great, thin and crispy. The crab cake sliders were not very good. Lots of filling and very little crab, I took a bite and didn't care for them at all.   When our server came back he said \"the sliders had a lot of filling didn't they?\". Uh yea, why didn't you say that when we asked if they were good? There seemed to be some interesting items on the menu and I may return for dinner some time, hopefully with a  better experience."}
{"text":"Are the people who work here zombies? No personality! Sat at the table and asked for silver wear only for it to not be brought out to the table. I had to get out of my seat to walk up to the sushi bar to get it myself. No refills on water! I had to bug the hostess for a refill only to get warm water with no ice. No check back on how the food taste! Had to ask the busser for to-go boxes only for her to rudely drop them on the table as she walked by without making any sort of eye contact. Had to stop the server after we were obviously completely done eating to get the check. Wake up people....Your service is NOT good!"}
