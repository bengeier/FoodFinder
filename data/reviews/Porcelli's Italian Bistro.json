{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at porcellis went there on a Monday night with two if my daughters and a friend . We had excellent service Sherry is amazing and Stacy who was not even our server was also quick to help.  They brought out fries for my youngest and I enjoyed a good bottle of wine thanks to the wine knowledge displayed by Sherry.   I highly recommend it.   The food was very good as I expected Sergio is one of the best chefs in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Office holiday lunch last week, group of 8.    Service was attentive and friendly despite the hustle and bustle... we got in a bit early, but the place filled quickly.  We started with family-style Bruschetta and fried Mozz... decent enough but the Mozz was on the oily side.  This was followed by house salads, which were obviously prepared well beforehand and straight from the fridge.    I had the \"blackened Mahi Mahi,\" which I guess meant \"microwaved with a sprinkle of cayenne... my neighbor's \"blackened salmon\" has the same seasoning.  Anyway, my fish was alright, though the \"Alfredo\" angel-hair bed was a clumpy mess of sticky oil.  The dishes of everyone at the table suffered from the same malady.  Don't get me wrong, this is OK for a quick \"regular\" lunch stop and I understand that the MO is to get people back to work in a timely manner... the price was also right.  However, beware if you're looking for a lunch spot for clients or customers.    Two stars for service, one added for a passable quick/ cheap lunch.  Minus one for paper napkins."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent place within walking distance from my hotel and stumbled upon this Italian place with 70's Rock playing and 4 old TVs above the bar showing baseball. The place was nearly dead, but it didn't bother me. The only 2 people there were the bartender and chef - both of whom greeted me.  Clarence is the chef and recommended the Penne Sausage. It was delicious.  Certainly not your typical Italian restaurant and pretty casual. I'd come back - how could you not?!"}
{"text":"What a great place to grab lunch.  The lunch portions remind me of a full dinner portion.  The eggplant parm is excellent with some nice crust forming on the edges.  I always seem to end up bringing some home as I cannot finish it all."}
{"text":"Staff is wonderful. I had the seafood mac with blackened grouper. The fish was charred so badly and had an awful overcooked smell. I would have sent it back if I weren't in the company of clients. So to be fair, the restaurant did not get a chance to right this dish on their behalf. The other diners seemed happy with their meals."}
{"text":"5 stars... yup!!! The way I look at things, you get what you pay for. I still can't believe all their lunches are under $12. For the portion size and quality, this is a great value. Especially considering, the average lunch on this block is already $8. I'll gladly shell out a few extra to come here anyday.   This is my #1 go to lunch spot in the city. I have had their chicken parm sandwich and meatball sandwich ($8 and yummy), the chicken picatta and chicken alfredo ($11, not bad) and my favorite is the linguine with shrimp and crab in a lobster reduction sauce ($11, salad and bread included). Punch yourself for not trying this dish yet, it is that good. This isn't about the scenery people, this is about a fast, affordable, delicious lunch on the fly. For what you pay, this is 5 stars all day. Much better than a lot of italian restaurants I have tried and cheaper too."}
{"text":"Our group had just flown in from all different areas of the country. We were tired and hungry and this place was close by. When we walked in, we were the only table at prime dinner time. That should have been our first clue. The fried mozzarella appetizer was good, the rest of the food was pretty horrible. One person in our group got the lasagna and it came out cold. They took it back and stuck it in the microwave and brought it out on a smaller plate because the original plate got too hot in the microwave. I'm not surprised they have a microwave but my biggest pet peeve is the use of a microwave. Especially in a restaurant. I don't use one at home so I expect to not go out and pay someone else to use one. She left hers uneaten and said it wasn't any good regardless of temperature. I had the chicken picatta. There was about half a jar of capers on it and the sauce was thick and salty. My angel hair pasta was way overdone. We all agreed this place was terrible."}
{"text":"Overall, I would give this place a 3.5.  This lunch visit was more of a 3, but all in all price, portion and value are pretty decent here.   I've been here many times, can't believe that I haven't posted a review before now.  I've never had dinner here, and according to other Yelpers, I probably shouldn't plan to.  There is usually a pretty decent crowd at lunch.  Today, I ordered the Angel Hair pasta with tomatoes, basil and chicken in garlic and olive oil ($12).  The entree included fresh italian bread with a side of garlic butter (nice touch) and a small side salad which I had with the house balsamic dressing.   The entree today, was just ok.  It was a little bit murky in color and a bit clumpy in texture and taste.   It was decent, just not as good as previous visits.   My dining companion ordered the Chicken Piccatta and she was very pleased.  Overall you can't beat the portions and price.  I will definitely return.....for lunch:-)"}
{"text":"Finally a place downtown where I can get bruschetta, aka \"Italian Crack\".  Theirs is done right, with lots of garlic and drizzled with delicious balsamic.  Coworkers have sampled a few of the dishes and enjoyed everything.  I order bruschetta every time, I can't help it.  Lunch service can vary; we've been served very quickly at times, and we've been served slowly at times and had to wait awhile to get our check - very annoying when you're on a lunch break.  Overall, though, the service is good and the food is good.  Some people complained about the cost but really anywhere you eat downtown costs a little more than it would somewhere else.  I didn't find the prices unreasonable."}
{"text":"Terrific place! Lots of new items on the menu.  Got dragged in off the street by little Spitfire of the server named Anna. She promised a terrific mail and the chef delivered!"}
{"text":"Lunch was tasty but took forever. I got the gnocchi with marinara and it was delicious but I felt like it was kind of lacking for the additional cost of adding chicken - it wasn't worth it. About $11 for pasta and a salad so very reasonably priced. I ate the second half the next day for lunch and can definitely see myself doing that again. If you work in the area and have clients in town and want somewhere low key and non-pretentious, especially for lunch, try here!"}
{"text":"Great Service!! Good food and atmosphere!!!  Chicken Marsala was good and a large portion."}
{"text":"Maybe this was a \"miss\" for us because we didn't go during the lunch hour, but really--shouldn't a restaurant be great for all meals of the day?   1) Overpriced. For the people who are talking about lunch prices, please explain to me why a difference of 4-5 hours increases the prices of the same dishes significantly. I really need to know. A meatball sandwich for my bf's son (which only had 2 meatballs on it and was all bread otherwise) was $11. You can get a better version at Subway, which is pretty sad considering the fact... the value just isn't there. If you get what you pay for, our dishes should have blown my mind.   2) Food taste/quality vs. price: My gnocchi dish was overpriced and under-seasoned. Gnocchi is supposed to be pillowy, light and glorious. These strange looking dumplings were chewy and starchy, so much so they were getting stuck in my teeth. The blush sauce they were in was underseasoned and bland. My bf's dish was just about the only flavorful dish, but even he left feeling super-cheated for the money we spent.   3) Update your website/menu! We came here based on Yelp reviews saying \"it's a great deal\" and we looked at the online menu to confirm. Once we came in to sit down, most menu items were priced $4-7 higher than the online menu stated. And unlike other Yelpers, I don't think the portions were even close to meeting the price. Furthermore, think about how much it costs you to make pasta at home? Even making pasta from scratch wouldn't be this grossly overpriced. Again, the value is just NOT there.   Just about the only thing that redeemed this place were the very sweet barmaids/servers taking care of everyone. They could have used another server that was strictly just on the floor, not behind the bar. (This looks more professional, especially with their high prices) But even so, these two ladies busted their butts to serve everyone appropriately.   Overall, I wish I could have our money back, but we certainly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fried cheese patties are over priced at $9, bruschetta was French bread thick cut with huge tomatoes if you're into that, they were ok, salad was just lettuce and cheese, linguini with shrimp and crab had a nice portion of shrimp but you can't tell crab is in there. Overall it's quite over priced and zero atmosphere. Paper table cloth, printed menu from someone's computer. I wouldn't bother coming here."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a place in downtown CLE where you can sit down and enjoy lunch, and leave for under $20.00.  Porcelli's is that place!  The menu is HUGE (which can be intimidating) - and they consistently have 10 - 12 specials as well.  I tend to venture to whatever wheat pasta special they have, which is normally in a yummy white wine sauce and over packed with veggies galore.  How can I complain?   Whether you're looking for chicken parm, eggplant parm, spaghetti, ravs, tortellini, alfredo, cavatelli, gnocchi, lasagna and/or everything in between - they have it!  Don't be scared to ask, because they welcome substitutions and additions.  It's a great little hole in the wall Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Where to start, my girlfriend and I recently visited porcellis on a Wednesday night to celebrate an anniversary. As soon as we walked in I knew we should have walked right back out. The hostess/bartender found the need to tell us that food would take at least a half an hour, then after we were sat we waited about ten minutes for our server to take a drink order. As I read the menu and waited for my drink I quickly realized that we would had been better off staying home. When the grilled salmon is priced higher on your menu then the lobster ravioli something smells fishy and it was the fake lobster. My chicken marsalla didn't fair any better, overcooked pasta and chicken, store bought bacon bits and not a bit of seasoning. To cap the night off I had to go and find my sever when we where ready to leave, this place is a joke and should be ashamed to call what they serve as food."}
{"text":"Just had a business lunch here with 6. We did have reservations which where setup but they had us down for a different day, either way we got in an sat down after a scuffle with waitresses getting nervous and apologetic. The food is good actually its great. maybe not the greatest I've EVER ate but for lunch during the day with a meal under $15 bucks with tip I'd say we lucked out. I had the Baked Talapia over sautéed spinach and fired calamari in a spicy asian sause. It was delicious. Most of the recipe seems simple enough to recreate at home, which I'll be doing. All in all a good place, great for lunch while at work but for dinner I'd step it up a tad more as far as my fancy italian goes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is neat, it looks like a fancy Italian restaurant on the inside but it's much more casual. The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes and  the prices are very reasonable! I got the baked penne and it was delicious and enough for 2 meals. I'll definitely be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Let me start off with The fried mozzarella is pretty good.  The service was great. Our server was very nice. The bruschetta was huge and bland. The shrimp & crab linguini had loads of shrimp no crab, just a few shredded pieces. The spaghetti was good.  But when we said we did not care for salad we were told we can substitute for a bowl of soup, we were then charged for the bowls of soup. It was dinner time and the place was empty, 5 people at the bar no one at any of the 30 tables. You pay Olive Garden prices for not the best food. It is not horrible just overpriced for the quality. It is an Italian Bistro without Lasagna. There is construction going on and the restaurant is in an alley, could be why it's empty, or could be price. I will let you decide!"}
{"text":"Meh. That's a good word for this joint, which ought to be better but it aint. That's because there's slim pickings for the sit down lunch crowd on this side of Downtown Cleveland. When the going gets tough, the mediocre survive. In Cleveland.  I had one of the 'specials' of the day. And I've got to say that if you're going to put something on the special menu - it ought to be better than something I can warm up at home. How do I describe the talapia? Boring? Bland? Covered in some vaguely beige sauce? I've experienced more culinary joy staring at a box of Rice A Roni.   The atmosphere is satisfactory. The service is not bad. The ambience is midwestern business casual.   Gawd. I guess that says everything."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like brown rice and vegetables for lunch, and sometimes I feel like a large plate of pasta in rich sauce that makes me want to nap on my desk for the rest of the afternoon. When I want the latter, I come here. It's definitely geared toward the office set who wants to get in and out in under an hour, and they do that very well. Service has never been lacking, in my experience. Pasta dishes are very competent and most are $10. My favorite is the penne with chicken, walnuts, and spinach in a sherry cream sauce. Entrees are sizable and come with a small salad."}
{"text":"Had \"lunch\" at Porcelli's, and while the service was ok (waitress had \"no idea\" what the red wine choices by the glass were) the food was abysmal. The menu said my entree came with a salad, but I never received one. When the meal came, it was rubbery chicken, yellowed broccoli and lousy pasta swimming in a flabby cream sauce. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Left after one bite of the main entree. Blackened grouper over linguine with a reduced lobster and clam sauce. Girlfriend had a salad with salmon. My pasta sauce looked like wax and cheese sauce and the fish was comparable to a soggy cracker. The spicy calamari and shrimp we're was just buffalo sauce on rubber. Thankfully the waitress took our meals off the tab. I never walk out on a meal, that is how bad this one was."}
{"text":"Great lunch offering in downtown Cleveland. Their chicken parmesan is up there with the best and it isn't too expensive. Their new location offers a more classy feel and the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Ate from here for the first time via take out. Wanted to test it before recommending to frieds for lunch.  Had the Pesto Chicken sandwich serve on a  thick piece of toasted Italian bread topped with a generous roasted red pepper slice and pesto spread .  It was great. Chix cooked perfect and nicely trimmed so I didn't bite into any of those funky tendons and fat and was juicy not dry as one often gets. Served with a small salad too.  Portion perfect for lunch. $9.00 reasonable.  Will come again . . .  With friends."}
{"text":"There are not a ton of quick and affordable sit-down lunch spots in this part of town.  This is one of the better choices -- the food is good, service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable.  I can't recall at this point which of the pasta dishes I've tried, but they were all good -- not great but enjoyable.  Antipasto starters were extremely good.  Decent wine list and the per-glass pricing is not too bad.  I was also lucky enough to try this place for a private catered event.  Their staff was extremely attentive; we were given great options for food selections for our budget; and the size and ambiance of the restaurant are perfect for small business or family holiday parties."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but every time I go there I get more and more disappointed. The service has never been very good. It's either you're waiting to be seated, waiting to have a server come greet you or waiting for the bill....you are always waiting. It's always a total miss on the service. Now the food, this is where things keep going down hill.  The first time I went there I thought the food was delicious, yeah the service sucked but the food was great. Then every time I stopped in the service was just as terrible but the food was also getting worse and worse. Today, was the worst of the worst. The service was beyond bad, waited forever for water, salad and main entree. Then waited forever for the bill. The food was awful. I ordered the blacken salmon pasta, which is what I always get. The salmon was blackened alright...I mean it was burnt. And the pasta was beyond cooked, looked and tasted almost like shoelaces at this point.  So yeah, I want to like this place but I don't know if I can keep trying anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Porcelli's with a co-worker for lunch. The decor hasn't changed since it was Cest la Vie, so it looks like a dated night club inside. There is still a full bar too.  We were served bread and water and I ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. My co-worker ordered chicken alfredo pasta with mushrooms and broccoli.  A little while later, our food was served. My chicken Parmesan sandwich was tasty. It had a nice piece of delicious chicken on it, the sauce was not vibrant, but it was good, and the bun was just right. I really liked the sandwich.   My co-worker loved his pasta. In fact, he insisted that I taste it, which I did. It was excellent! The sauce had bits of mushrooms and bacon in it and it had a rich, savory flavor. The chicken was moist and delicious. I will definitely order this dish next time. He gave the dish five stars.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow and the place is tucked away, making it easy to miss.  HOWEVER, the food is good and the servers are nice and helpful - I just think they run very lean staffed making it a slower dining experience.  I especially appreciated being able to talk through my hunger level and taste preferences before ordering so I could get the right recommendation for me."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local businessman on the street.  Off the main toad but s great find. Lori the bartender was so attentive. Orders meatball appetizers. DELICIOUS!!  Caesar's salads and a pizza!! Food was fresh and delicious!  Chef John came out and chatted with us.  Good food and a very nice evening.  Felt like we were family! Coming back tomorrow to try my favorite, chicken piccata.   Can't wait!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and staying at the Westin, where dinner entrees at the hotel restaurant (Urban Farmers) are in the $50-$80 range. My ideal find for dinner on a Friday night at 7:00 was somewhere not to pricey, not too busy, and not too far away... and I wasn't holding my breath for any of them.  Fortunately, Porcelli's won on all accounts. It's definitely a bistro -- one room with 15 or so tables and a bar -- but the only people there were 6 or 8 jovial guys at the bar who came across as regulars. Service was super fast -- I had my salad within a minute of ordering it and the entree came out within 10 minutes of finishing my salad. The waitress was friendly and helpful and kept my glass full.  The entree (a chicken penne dish in a tomato cream sauce) was large and tasty... the only thing keeping me from giving five stars was that it was a touch on the salty side. Very flavorful though! I had a caesar salad on the side; it and the bread were both delicious.  Overall, a great find for a conference-goer who wants a nice meal at a decent price. I'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"I can't believe Porcelli's only has a 2 1/2 star rating on Yelp! I love this place! I did read some of the bad reviews, and I guess I can see those things happening (slow service at dinner, less than stellar seafood...)   However, I have to say: the lunch servers and cooks are AWESOME! I have been there for dinner a couple times, and it feels like an entirely different restaurant - my favorite dishes that I order for lunch are unrecognizable at dinner. Maybe there is a different kitchen staff at night?  Anyway, I go for lunch a couple times a month for the past 9 years (it was called something else when I first started going, before it became a Porcellis, I think) and I have never had a bad experience. I absolutely love the servers - very efficient and friendly and when that place is packed for lunch (pretty much every day) - they are busting their asses!   I think the food is delicious! The salads are humongous and fresh (try the spring salad!) and every pasta dish I've tried has been delicious. My favorite thing lately is a special they have every now and then - blackened tilapia over balsamic rice and beans. Love it! The eggplant parmesan is among the best (and hugest serving) I've ever had.  The prices are great, especially for downtown! Most entrees are $10 or less and pastas include a really nice little salad (try the raspberry or poppyseed dressings - yum!) and fresh, soft sliced Italian bread with super garlicky butter."}
{"text":"Food is great but I would say having your waitress smoking a cig at the entrance is a bad look and not appealing."}
{"text":"Small intimate, hidden gem across from the parking garage on 6th. Has a wall window and a large bar.  Stuffed banana pepper app had a little heat, and was very good. I really enjoy the lobster ravioli. Others enjoyed their pasta varieties and salads. Service was enjoyable. Definitely a must go to anytime. Park at the arenas, and walk through the arcade of shops to 6th."}
