{"text":"Love this place and so does my dog!  Great food, giant iced lattes, and a very comfortable patio and atmosphere.  Kind of forget it is there sometimes but definitely worth remembering."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tiny little coffee shop with an upscale feeling. The outdoor shady patio under the trees is the best place to sit and relax. It is attached to the Grayhawk Golf clubhouse so you see lots of golfers running in an out before or after their tee times. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because they are quick to serve the coffee or mufffins on display. But getting an omelete takes a while. If you aren't in a rush that's fine, but they seem to be much better staffed for the front counter than the back kitchen."}
{"text":"Mojo is a neighborhood favorite. It's easily the best breakfast offering in North Scottsdale, and it's great for grab and go during the work week because of their 6:30 opening time. The staff is very nice and they always greet you with a smile. My personal favorite has got to be the mojo burrito - this isn't your run of the mill breakfast burrito. It's a bit more than a \"-berto's\" burro but the ingredients are fresh, and the chicken chorizo is much more tasty than greasy pork chorizo you find in other places. They can make just about any morning drink you would need, from iced coffee to blended fruit smoothies. The patio is dog friendly and they even provide fresh drinking water for them. Check this place out if you are in North Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good. I would give the food 3 stars but there is room for improvement on the management side. They have an awful \"hard stop\" at 11:00 am for breakfast. I was there when they turned people away at 11:01. This makes no sense, especially since they start serving lunch at 11:00 even though the lunch menu is called \"nooner.\" Their prices are also a little high, especially since they are technically a juice bar but do not use organic produce. This place has the potential to be one of the best breakfast places in north Scottsdale since the atmosphere is wonderful, but can definitely improve in some areas."}
{"text":"Love this place! ! Healthy smoothies for the healthy freaks like me! And the atmosphere is pretty great too! The counter girls are always really nice !"}
{"text":"I often go to this cafe for coffee with a friend. Today, after finishing my breakfast, I went in to buy a coffee refill and it turned out that the register had broken down and the restaurant manager was trying to fix it. I asked the cafe manager for the refill, and she said she couldn't give me one since the register was broken. No apology, no smile, not an ounce of customer service. I asked if she could make an exception and just give me a refill instead. She said no, that just wasn't possible. It was certainly not in my control that the register was broken, and good American customer service dictates that she could have spilled a couple of drops of coffee into my cup, or that at the very least she could have been friendly! She ruined my morning in an otherwise charming cafe, on a gorgeous Scottsdale morning. I am rethinking visiting this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!    Sitting in their darling bistro or outside on their patio, enjoying their delicious coffees & breakfast items was so refreshing.     Highly recommend, especially if you're out biking....   Roll on by!!"}
{"text":"Nice patio and atmosphere, but food is mediocre at best. Too many other good breakfast places out there like JJ's and Soul."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cute little quaint place hidden in the midst of Grayhawk Golf Club and neighborhood. The breakfast and lunch menu items are hidden treasures. The Mojo burrito is the best burrito I've ever had. You can also get it as a bowl if you are scared of carbs. The ladies that work there are super sweet and helpful and will know you by name after just a few visits. I love going after hot yoga for a freshly squeezed juice. If I'm on to go I'll pop in for their kale and quinoa salad which is another must try. They have dairy free milks, gluten free muffins and bread. Score!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Went there with wife, and my 1 and 4 year old. They had the pancake and the French toast both of which were great. I had the Mojo Burrito which was delicious. There is indoor and outdoor seating and a very friendly atmosphere. The fruit shakes and coffee were delicious also. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful setting, great people that wait on you, and the food was very good. It's like being at a resort, instead your at your local bistro. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting; friendly staff; really delicious breakfast! Our group loved the skinny frittata with mushroom and artichoke and the cinnamon rolls. Yummy smoothies (Merry Berry) and coffees!"}
{"text":"My friends and I (6-10 people) have been coming here every Sunday for over three years.   We really enjoy sitting out back after a workout and catching up with each other.  Today they very rudely told us they would no longer serve us on the back patio and we would have to wait for our food to be prepared and then take it back ourselves.   The lack of hospitality really ruined the morning.   I guess next week we will give First Watch a try.  It seems the young ladies were far more interested in playing on their phones than serving us."}
{"text":"The mojo burrito is amazing and the patio is very relaxing."}
{"text":"I want to love Mojo, special location, great feel, looks great. Good service but.... Coffee sucks, your a morning joint you need great coffee 

Please please try another brew"}
{"text":"Yucky! I had the breakfast burrito and it was NOT organic. The cheese was too yellow and gooey to be real cheese. They put in some pink slime in there to make it look like meat. 

I also had coffee and it did not taste fresh or organic."}
{"text":"This is the perfect coffee/breakfast place.  Staff is friendly and friendly drinks are delicious!!   Refreshing place away from those national chains!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  

I'm appalled by the whiny workout group that have left recent negative reviews.  I'm glad you're going to First Watch, I wouldn't want to spend a minute around you.  You apparently kill the good vibes at Mojo's!

This is NOT a sit down and service restaurant, you order your food and pick it up at the counter like everybody else.  Just because you're ceo's, presidents blah blah blah doesn't mean you get ROYAL treatment, you get to pick up your food like everyone else.  

I'm assuming you're one of those annoying cyclists in a tight, ball gripping leotard.  If you took your leotard off before walking into Mojo's, you might not be so 'up tight'!  Loosen up brother!"}
{"text":"I love the place because they have a great place to sit outside. The atmosphere outside is really nice. The juices and smoothies are pretty good."}
{"text":"Very neat place to enjoy morning coffee or weekend breakfast. The mojo breakfast burrito is excellent. Our daughter enjoyed the whole wheat pancakes (with the addition of chocolate chips of course). They have great iced coffee and lots of other things we look forward to trying on our next visits."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The food and smoothies are delicious and healthy. You can sit on the patio with your dog and relax. The restaurant is at Grayhawk Golf Course in nice part if town."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Mojo Morning Joint before work this morning because it's not far from where I live OR where I work and because it opens early (6:30a) AND because it has coffee. Seemed like a solid start for this little coffee stop set within a golf club.

Did I mention that this breakfast joint is set within the GrayHawk Golf Club in North Scottsdale? Yeah. DEFINITELY not my usual speed, but worth a try considering all the other variables (related to convenience) mentioned above.

Let's just start by saying that I feel very out of place at a high-brow golf club. I was skeptical walking through the front door, but was immediately met by the smiling faces of three pretty young ladies who seemed genuinely happy to be awake.

They were quick to take my order and make small conversation and I was instantly put at ease. I placed an order for an Americano (with extra shots, no cream) and a Breakfast Burrito with Jenn (the manager), then I found myself a seat while Gabby prepared my drink.

The interior of Mojo Morning Joint is bright and clean with plenty of seating both inside and out. The outdoor seating is also very clean and covered with plenty of natural shade (read: trees). The overall atmosphere is calming.

The Americano arrived and was just ok. Not bad, but not great. I didn't expect it to be, though - this isn't your local hipster coffee roaster in the guts of downtown Phoenix, it's a golf club. My drink cost me $3.50 +tax. About on par with other options in this area.

The food, on the other hand, cost me just shy of $10 and I was very disappointed by the portion size when it arrived. I was further disappointed upon taking my first few bites. It just wasn't that good. At all. Not even the salsa! And I can get behind MOST salsas...  :-/

So: mid-to-costly prices, mediocre coffee, small portioning, and not-great food. Why the four stars? And would I come back? The answer is: the girls. And: likely.

Mojo gets four stars because it has employed genuinely bright and personable young women who make the experience well worth the trip. They made me feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated. I'd come back just for that, and this kind of service deserves a couple extra stars.

Thank you, Jenn and Gabby and other-girl-who's-name-I-didn't-get, for serving me and for being so bright and kind and positive even during the earlier hours of your day. It was noticed, and appreciated, and I'll likely be back to see you again soon.  :)"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is located at Grayhawk Golf Course but is open to the public.  Their outdoor seating area is comfortable and has plenty of umbrellas for shade.  it is a dog friendly place with water dishes for dogs.  Employees often bring treats to our dog as we sit outside and enjoy our coffee.  Good coffee and a great casual breakfast menu.  They have a few gluten free muffin options."}
{"text":"These people griping about mojo are ridiculous. The place is quality and it's a shame they can't see how hardworking those girls are! I've been going there weekly for almost 8 years and have never had an issue. My gosh, just wait patiently for your food!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop & bistro!  In addition to the coffee/espresso drinks you would expect, their breakfast menu was chock full of unique dishes that all sounded really good.  I had a breakfast omelette with turkey, brie cheese, avocado, and mushrooms.. delicious!  This place works very well for \"grab and go\" but also has a nice sit-down area both inside and outside."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere at this place.  It's at a golf club and you might feel as though you need to be a member but you don't.  Just go in and order.

I cannot comment on the food - only had coffee.  It was extremely pleasant to sit on the patio with a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to get breakfast and delicious coffee. The patio is very nice and on a beautiful day there are a few places that are as nice to sit back and relax.I have a breakfast burrito with the sweet potatoes and chicken chorizo sausage. Every time I go there the food is consistent and the service is good. If you're looking for a nice easy spot to grab breakfast with some good views and good service this is the place to go in north Scottsdale.

Yes there are other places that have good breakfast food, but where can you go and grab some food and then meander through the proshop on your way to the putting green."}
{"text":"Undiscovered gem in North Scottsdale! Just down the street, people are pushing and shoving at Starbucks. If only they knew, a short drive up the hill is an awesome coffee joint with no waiting. I'm not going to tell them. I'll just wave as I drive by on my way to Mojo with a smile on my face. This place is what it must be like if someone gives you a blank sheet of paper and says design your dream coffeehouse. The patio is huge with comfy chairs, shade trees and umbrellas. There's even a dog watering station. Inside there's a variety of seating, including four leather chairs. My only complaint are the red metal bar stools. They are stylish but could be more comfortable. Otherwise, the decor is cool and fresh. The employees are friendly and go above and beyond. My drink is an iced latte which is always made to perfection. Something that can't be said at other places. I also like the ham and cheese croissant, which doesn't weigh you down and feeling stuffed. Sooner or later more people are going to discover this place so get in here now."}
{"text":"Cute place- FABULOUS apple cinnamon muffins.

Would have given it 5 stars but the prices are obnoxious!"}
{"text":"Strong ambience. Staff is personable, courteous and attentive. Best coffee shop in North Scottsdale, bar none."}
{"text":"The extensive drink options will please everyone.  The menu is small but delicious.  The atmosphere is inviting inside & out and it's kid & pet friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast on the go! Chorizo breakfast burritos are the best! Good place to get a fresh acai bowl too."}
{"text":"Glad I checked this place out! I'm always looking for cute places like this with healthy options and a nice welcoming staff haha. This place has both of those things! I did not order any food this time, just chai tea lattes for my mom and I, so this review is just for that and the atmosphere. Though the food did look delicious! 
There were a few people there at like 11 am on a Sunday, had a relaxed feel to it. A nice outdoor seating area, though I wouldn't want to be out there at this time of year. They had some great sounding options on both the food and drink menu. I was either interested in one of the mochas they had listed, the nutty one sounded good, or some type of latte with almond milk. I decided on a chai tea latte with cinnamon, it was 50 cents extra with almond milk, but worth it. It ended up being pricier than anticipated but not too bad. The girls working behind the counter were really nice too. I liked the atmosphere too, laid back, small cute coffee shop. I will be back for breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"I've looked for a breakfast place that wowed me,  this is one of them!  The Mojo burrito is so perfect along with a fresh green juice,  perfect start to the day.  The burrito is shareable as its large."}
{"text":"Hi, please refer to previous review about 13 days ago. This is a follow up... I'm one of the 6!
We are local athletes that have been coming to MoJos for a couple of years. Our experience has been great. We have recommended MoJos to all our friends. Good food, friendly staff and great environment. Bear in mind we are executives at the CEO, VP and Ownership level.  We take social media very seriously and do not post frivolous reviews; we respond to all negative reviews that are posted to our businesses and do not appreciate when people post inaccurate reviews. However, we felt as a group that something has dramatically shifted at MoJos and would like to pass it along for everyone to consider...
We just finished the Phoenix Marathon (nope, we're not all cyclists) today and since MoJo was centrally located we agreed to meet up there after the race.  We were hopeful our previous post did some good. In fact, just the opposite.  The front staff treated as as poorly as ever and once again refused to bring our meal to the table. We were forced to 1) pick it up ourselves from the kitchen and 2) get it from the front counter staff. We have a large group of 6, so we head out back where more room is available. When two of us sat down today, the director of operations came by. He said, and I quote \"you must have been the grp that posted the negative review\". How did he know? The front staff we guess -they know us? He then proceed to assassinate  our characters by stating, and I quote \"are you the ones that want to hide behind social media. Yelp reviews are terrible and only for those that want to be negative\".   Nothing could be further from the truth. As executives and business owners we see reviews as an opportunity to improve and learn how better to serve our customers. The dir of ops at grayhawk
has in our opinion missed a great opportunity.  And acted completely out of line for his position. Something has shifted at MoJos and unless and until it addressed we will not be back -and it starts at the dir of ops level.  We have a large presence in this community and will no longer recommend this place to our peers. We vote with our wallets and will not be rewarding this place for bad behavior. All of us are informed if/when negative reviews are posted to our businesses and are are given the opportunity to respond; MoJos never reached out to us since our first reviews -ever."}
{"text":"We are visiting my in-laws in Scottsdale and I used Yelp to help Us find a great breakfast spot. I am so excited to have found this gem!  We enjoyed a breakfast burrito and it is such a charming place.  And, we saw a snake, yikes!"}
{"text":"RECOMNENDED: if you haven't devoured their Mojo burrito, you are sorely missing out!  This is hands down one of the tastiest breakfast burritos this side of Earth!  It's a delightful combination of chicken chorizo, sweet potatoes, cheese and more. I am a fan. They also offer a variety of coffees and adult beverages ;)

To top it off, the staff at Mojo's are super sweet, very friendly and cool. 

The atmosphere is laid back and unless someone pointed it out, you'd probably never know that you were eating at a gold course clubhouse. They have plenty of shades outside seating & have put out water bowls for your 4 legged babies!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and have great coffee or drink of your choice. Great staff.  Enjoy

{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and food. Fresh juice and coffee are delicious. Jenn and Megan always have a smile!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Not a fan of the wheat tortilla on the mojo burrito and the sweet potatoes tasted similar to carrots next to the other flavors.  Not my thing."}
{"text":"Mojo burrito is the best!!!! Spicy chorizo, pepper jack cheese, sweet potatoes,  it's incredible.  My boys had the ham and cheese croissant which were simple and good.  Anxious to try other menu items.  We will definitely be back.  Beautiful outdoor seating.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is been my go-to place for years and I think one of Scottsdale's best kept secrets. It has a beautiful patio area and is so relaxing and the ladies really work at making your drink perfect. They are always so pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Best breakfast borrito around try the mojo borrito. So delicious with a little chollulah and a tea. I love the dog parking for our dogs with a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little shop. My friend and I stopped in for breakfast and the food was delicious. I had oatmeal and a green smoothie, while she enjoyed a burrito and a coffee. The portions were large and the ambiance bright and cheery. I can't wait to return to this shop!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so mellow, the service is great and the food is healthy."}
{"text":"I'm a member of a grp of athletes who have been stopping by MoJos on the weekend and often couple times during the week after training.  We sit on the back patio at one of the large tables that can accommodate are group. The staff all know us by face. To our surprise, the front cashier rudely insisted that this time we wait in front lobby for our order as they were no longer willing to serve our food to the back patio!  As regulars, we were shocked and taken back. The cashier was insistent. We all found this to be exceedingly poor service as there were plenty of staff on hand and the kitchen is closer to the back patio than the front patio so there appeared to be no greater effort reqd on their part. However, none of the staff members were too busy to gossip w/themselves behind the counter and/or talk on their cell phones. If this is the new policy we are more than happy to take our business to one of the other breakfast joints nearby. This was a great place -what a shame!"}
