{"text":"As a buffet, this restaurant is great!The price is low and the food is good for the price, but to order, I recommend to go further and get food of better quality. I ordered online and waited for 45 minutes past the delivery time before actually calling back. Their delivery guy didn't even show up until another 20 minutes. By that time, I was hangry (hungry + angry) and I told myself that if the food was at least good, I would be okay with it. The problem is that most of the chicken was bones, their chow mein was the same as the buffet one which would have been great if I paid 5$ for it, but I paid much more!! So to dine in, this restaurant is perfect for the area, but DO NOT order from them!! The food is all-you-can eat 5$ buffet quality and the service is more than meh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Thursday evening. Was quiet and the staff was so friendly! Food was delicious- canadian style chinese food.  We had a great time and loved the buffet.  Will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"My personal go to fast food chinese buffet. $8 for all you can eat lunch special.   Good selection. Place is dated and food quality so so. But price can't be beat. Egg rolls are the best I've ever had. General Tao is good, and they even have deep fried spare ribs, which I have not found any where else. Not a place to bring a date! Service is fast and friendly.   Located on dorval Ave, adequate parking in the back. Have had take out , but prefer the buffet. Dessert selection is ok , but I don't go for the desserts. Supper is about $12. Good crowd on Sunday's, which is the cheapest day for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We usually do take-out from Chows and this is a pretty good indicator of the quality of the food, I find.  My General Tao chicken was terrific; not little nubs of batter with a hint of chicken inside.  The General Tao consisted of large pieces of chicken, fried perfectly and the sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and of spicy.  I was a little disappointed with the chow mein, it lacked flavour.  The egg rolls were crunchy and the cabbage was fresh.  The pineapple chicken was delicious and there was a row over who would have the last piece.  The garlic spareribs were also very good, the meat was not tough in the least.    The rice was good if a bit average."}
{"text":"Just across the Walmart and Maxi. Convenient place to grab some traditional Chinese food. We order it for take away."}
{"text":"Went to the buffet and had a nice surprise . I was eating it when I felt something strange in my mouth . I ended up spitting out several metal staples . When I checked the dish further , I found several more . This is the first and last time I will eat here . I took a photo . See for yourself ."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet, after reading the reviews here.  The decor is interesting.  The service was excellent!  The lunch buffet didn't have what I was craving: general tao chicken, pineapple chicken or even a beef dish. The fried rice was dry.  Pretty much everything was pork. I found the food good - but it wasn't hot, it was more like just above room temperature which is disappointing and probably the reason I spent 35 minutes in the bathroom an hour after eating there.  I would recommend ordering off the menu and not the buffet for that reason."}
{"text":"Good place to eat at night.  The owner was friendly to us and the food ordered was delicious.  Hope to come again if we visit Canada."}
{"text":"The interior decor feels exotic and original. I love eating Chinese food and I requested the owner to make me an authentic vegetarian meal. He was amazing, he asked me a few questions and customized my meal to my liking (added spiciness, soft tofu and curry). Extra bonus to the whole thing is that they let me stay after hours so I could wait for my ride back home. What I witnessed was a good person who tried really hard to please a customer. Thumbs up to the staff!"}
{"text":"Chows is a splendid little buffet with a pleasant and warm decor. It has a south sea feel with bamboo dominant theme. The decode is clear and pleasant. 5/5  I am visually impaired and require some assistance with navigating buffets. The staff was both helpful, cheerful, and accommodating. Staff 5/5  The food selection is limited due to physical space constraints. Food selection 3/5  Food quality is par to good for buffet fare Food quality 4/5  They are licensed.  The value is par for the course. 3/5  Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"What a great experience we just had... NOT! We ordered take out, and I sent my boyfriend in to pick it up while I waited in the car. On the takeout menu there is a coupon that simply says \"4 free egg rolls on orders over $50, must be mentioned at the time of order.\" I was looking at the menu online and don't have a printer at home, but I figured it would be fine since I mentioned it. Nowhere near on the coupon does it say you need to hand them a physical copy.   So my boyfriend goes in to get the food and the lady at the counter tries to charge him for the egg rolls since we don't have the coupon. He protests, and she makes several colourful references including calling him an ass, and referring to me as \"an idiot\" and \"the dumb girl on the phone.\" What wonderful service! Hope you guys have a lovely holiday season."}
{"text":"Not at all the place it once was.  My dad loved the original so I spent plenty of time here in the, gulp, 60/70's.  After my visit in June 2014, It's now just an adequate chinese restaurant.  It was pretty empty and friends tell me it usually is.  Sadly Chows time may be up :-("}
{"text":"I ordered her today for lunch at work, I ordered the general Tao chicken, and asked for it SPICY.  I guess that means they just add a packet of hot sauce to your order because the sauce was anything but spicy.    On the plus side they use real chicken and nice big chunks.  Not like some places that that are a 1/4 chicken and 3/4 batter.  The thing that will prevent me from ordering there again is they don't do a General Tao sauce to my liking."}
{"text":"Ok at best,  likely you would have had better. The price is right for what you can get here, just stay away from their hot & sour soup ,Just not good. Friendly and quick service, not much of an atmosphere but its a nice cozy Chinese resto. In the heart of Dorval."}
{"text":"We just ordered Mothers Day take out from Chow's. We expected Chinese cuisine. What we received was 60 dollars of rice and sprouts. The won ton soup was good but rest went into the garbage and was tasteless sludge."}
{"text":"Ordered general Tsao's chicken and wonton soup to go. I'm from New Hampshire so Chinese food is different but this is the best general tsao's chicken I've ever had.  Real chicken perfectly cooked and excellent fried rice.  However, the wonton soup was terrible.  The noodles were too thin and over cooked. Overall very good food, excellent service. I would definitely go back and would recommend to others"}
