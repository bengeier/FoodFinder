{"text":"I can see why it's 6 minute Chinese because it sucks and they must not put any time or love in their cooking. Moreover, the delivery time wasn't even competitive with other Chinese places in town. If you want oily dry rice, breaded chicken composed of 85% breading and chewy, stringy chicken, go there. Also the egg roll was so greasy it left a dripping film of oil on my hands. The dumplings were ok, but only came with cheap soy sauce to dip them in. If you're considering 6 min Chinese, I would seriously reconsider."}
{"text":"No.

Crab rangoon = fried but mainly just that. Fried bits. Hardly any cream cheese. And what's crab? FAIL. 

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. Which I thought came with cashews? Said it was spicy; instead came with peanuts, and red chili pepper flakes. I didn't sweat a bit- and mind you, I am sensitive to spice.

I was hungry, and sick, and in the mood for de-congestive Chinese food. Not the cure. Just because it was open late should not have meant my money went there...."}
{"text":"short on time + not wanting to make dinner + convenience of online order/delivery = 6 minute chinese tonight for dinner. 

it was not good.  not even okay.  it was really kind of gross.  i ordered kung pao bean curd.... and literally... it was just bean curd and sauce.  no peanuts.  no water chesnuts.  no veggies.  nothing.  just bean curd..... oh, and sauce.  that tastes like sort of amped up sweet and sour sauce.  it was beyond gross.  i didn't even finish it.  

i have an idea, 6 minute chinese.  take an extra 6 or 7.... shooooot, i'll even wait 10 extra minutes.... and make your food edible."}
{"text":"Sucks!!!!!! Takes forever and tastes so so. The price was not expensive but don't be be fooled. It serve ur lunch at dinner time. I ordered at 11ish and get it by 4. Can not hate it more."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese food that I have had in a long time. My wife and I ordered delivery. She got Szechaun vegetables and I get sesame chicken. Two pretty typical Americanized Chinese meals. The vegetables were way overcooked and who knows what the chicken was. The pieces were so tiny and they were really leathery and chewy. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just to tell you to how horrible this place is.  The delivery guy took well over an hour and a half to get here, and I live in a clearly marked apartment down the street.  The order was half-wrong; I ordered mu-shu pork and got... pork liver with onion?  Blegh. The orange chicken was edible but boring and ... something was off.  Save your money."}
{"text":"We tried this place because their order minimum was $10 (not $20) and they had very reasonable prices.

The steamed pot stickers are fantastic. They aren't too big or too small and they're actually steamed and flavorful. The dipping sauce is great. The crab Rangoon was also very good, even if they seemed a bit overdone. The filling was very tasty.

Edited as of November 2011:

Tried this place again and went to go pick up the order. The guy behind the counter didn't even start making the meal until we showed up to pick up the meal, despite the fact that it was pre-paid online. The restaurant was unclean and the food was just okay. Wanted to like it more but we won't be going back, despite the tasty pot stickers and crab rangoon."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. 

Order #1 for delivery...Never got it.  After calling the restaurant the owner kept saying 5 minutes.  Never did receive the order

Order #2 for delivery...WRONG ORDER!  I had a craving and decided to give them another chance.  After waiting 1 hour I called and got my food about 10 minutes later.  The only problem was that it was NOT my food!  

I believe I'm done with them.  Back to Chopstix I go.

UPDATE: Owner called me 2 1/2 hours after my order and says that before refunding my money they are going to come and pick up the food!  1) I did NOT eat the food 2) I put it in my trash can 3)They want to make sure that they get everything back before refunding.   

Then she tried to tell me that I owe $12 more.  For what?  So I can have my initial order recooked.  LOL  Sorry guys, but I ate dinner an hour ago.  

So they are on their way to pick up the food that I did not touch and put in the trash can, so they can reimburse me.  Interesting business strategy."}
