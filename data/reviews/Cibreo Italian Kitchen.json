{"text":"Beautiful spot for an intimate meal, business lunch, dinner or lunch before a PlayhouseSquare show, or a special occasion! The food is classic Italian, but not what you may expect. They are true to the roots of rustic Tuscan cuisine.

The food is fantastic and the service has never disappointed. I have had many working lunches, and everyone hosted said they'd be back. Dinners are special here with romantic lighting, special dishes. Extra bonus, you can actually hear the people you come to dine with! In such a large space, this isn't always the case.

Try the sausage and bean soup and panini for lunch. The gnocchi is nothing that you would expect, an explosion of flavors and doesn't leave you too full. All of the pasta dishes are excellent. Chef Eric knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Good menu for dinning but limited and no  menu for the bar.  We just wanted something light before the show struggled to find anything we liked"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before a show at Playhouse Square on a Thursday and sadly, both the food and service was average. We tried the arancini and meatball appetizers, the arancini ended up being the best thing we ate all night. The meatballs were good size but the sauce was bland and it's the same sauce they put on top of the overly breaded chicken parm entree. We also tried the carbonara pasta and the sauce was fairly decent but the chicken made everything kind of slimy. Overall it seemed like a 'high end' Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"We had read so many good reviews about this place, we thought it would be amazing. We were wrong.  I ordered a beet and burrata salad. It basically had no dressing. Then we both got chicken parmesan. It too had no flavor. We were very, very disappointed with both the food and lack of service. We will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"Got there at 5:30. Had tickets to a show at 7:30. Told the waitress we wanted apps dinner and dessert. Took an hour to get our food. Everyone around me arrived after we did. They all got their food before us. Finally got our food at 7. Had 15 min to eat. No dessert. Food was tepid. So disappointed. Will not return or recommend. The bar tender was warm and an amazing. Such a shame. And a waste."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!!!  Wow!!!  Food was incredibly delicious!!  We had the butternut squash risotto and the salmon with root vegetables. Amazing!!  Mushroom bruschetta for appetizer... Mmmm such wonderful flavor!!  The pesto spread on the focaccia bread was so flavorful!!  The atmosphere with the brick and fireplace added a romantic ambiance!  Service by Nicole was perfect and pleasant.  Will definitely dine here again when in town as we are not locals.  Wish we had one of these in Michigan!!  Definitely give this awesome place a try"}
{"text":"I adore this place! I've been lucky enough to come here twice at odd times when they were just starting lunch, and just starting dinner so my boyfriend and I were the only ones in the whole place! Really great atmosphere, super romantic...if you're looking to plan your next date night, definitely give this place a try!

The server was very attentive, and genuinely friendly. We did the three course restaurant week thing with wine pairing, so he was making several trips to our table, but he was very sweet the entire time. 

This is some of the best pre-dinner bread around! The pesto-butter-EVOO combo is so delish that you will devour all four pieces and the little mini bread sticks in no time. Fortunately, when you run out they bring you more!

All three courses were absolutely wonderful. We ordered the arancini, meatballs, parmigiana, duck confit, panna cotta and zeppoli. I am STILL daydreaming about the zeppoli. 

Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I surprised my boyfriend and took him here for a celebratory dinner.  We came on a Monday evening for the 2 for $40 deal.  We started with a bottle of wine which was very refreshing & the bruschetta appetizer which was good. I ordered the salmon with root veggies and I loved it!!!  I am craving it all over again!  My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm & he raved about it.  The portions were very generous!  The one complaint I had was that they offered us a variety of waters but failed to us that we would be charged.  We spent ten dollars on water & were unaware until our bill came.  Overall though, we loved it & will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the decor because it is a beautiful place. But my party suffered through one of our worst dining experiences - ever. Slow, tasteless, and some food never came. Many better options in this area. 

So what happened? We arrived promptly for our 6PM reservation. Waited for 20 minutes for our first drinks to arrive (6:30PM) - once we order them. Waited almost an hour until salads came while the appetizer we ordered never made it out of the kitchen. (No explanation except the kitchen was backed up.) Then food we didn't order came out either as a replacement for the appetizer or to hold us until the entrees came. (Who knows since that was also unclear.) We turned that down and then less than five minutes later the entrees arrived - tasteless (we all desperately grabbed the salt shaker) and missing ingredients. 

The manager came over twice to apologize but had no explanation for what went so horribly wrong. He took money off our bill, but by then it was much too little too late. (Note to managers - things can't go that bad unless you are completely clueless about what is happening in the kitchen and dining room. This points to your incompetence as much as your staffs. My suggestion is that since you have already failed miserably, you might as well comp the meal and offer gift certificates to perhaps get us back again. Lamely saying \"we had a bad night\" and that you \"hope you give us a second chance\" are not inspiring words to dinners who spent two grueling hours in what was suppose to be a joyous birthday celebration.)

My advice is to avoid this restaurant. There are too many other good choices in this area to waste time hoping your experience will be better."}
{"text":"Weirdly awful.

I went here tonight to celebrate my \"wife's\"  birthday. The waitress seemed cold. Maybe it was the 2 for $40 special. We can't know. 

An an asparagus thing was brought to the table and it was fairly good, but out of the blue an old man sitting at the bar eavesdropping wheeled around and inserted himself into our conversation - inappropriately. We were taken aback. We both travel a lot. Neither of us has ever experienced an intrusion like this in a restaurant. We ignored him.

A few minutes later he got up and stood next to our table and continued to insist that we engage with him. My \"wife\" is not one to indulge such intrusions and she loudly and repeatedly told him to back off and leave us alone. He argued that he \"practically owned the place\" and continued to accost us verbally.  Eventually he wandered off.

Soon our cold waitress reappeared and my \"wife\" let her know that we weren't happy about it. The waitress quickly defended him saying: \"He's here almost every night. He's harmless.\" 

Long story short the food was decent or better but we were made to feel by the manager and the waitress like we were in the wrong while this \"regular\" customer with no concept of appropriate boundaries was accommodated.

Totally weird."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and food was great as usual. I love the pesto that comes with the bread! The meatball appetizer was delicious, and the tomato bisque was fantastic as well. It could have been a bit quicker for lunch, but we did not tell the server we were in any sort of rush."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. I don't ever write reviews on things, but I have to on this one. I'm not sure where all these positive reviews are coming from, honestly. Being one of the only restaurants near Playhouse Square, it's hard not to take advantage of the convenience; however, I'll make more of an effort to go somewhere else the next time I'm going to a show.

The first time I went here, I was ignored for a solid 6 minutes while sitting at a half-empty bar. Bartenders, more than one, walked briskly past my guest and I without eye contact or any acknowledgement of us being there. I should've gotten up and left right then. The service remained at that disappointing level the whole time we stayed. Bartenders were having conversations right in front of us about how they're \"not busy at all\" and were \"looking for something to do\" as my drink sat empty in front of their faces. I've worked in the service industry for quite some time, so I'm normally extremely liberal with my forgiveness towards shoddy service. I was pissed off about the service for two days.

Joke's on me, because I happened to have another show to attend a week later. Decided to give this place another shot. Will not do that again. Service was once again extremely sub-par, but this time, it was uncomfortable. The bartender told me that I should order another iced tea (3 times) because he \"made an entiiiiiiire pitcher, JUST for me, and you won't order another one?\" When I didn't laugh at his attempt at a joke, he recanted and said \"just kidding....\". I can take a joke, ok? But this was a shot at The Customer who makes a server/bartender/runner prepare something they didn't want to prepare, and it was a subtle, passive-aggressive guilt trip.
 
My guest and I watched a couple sitting next to us ask where their Caprese salad was, and the bartender replies, \"Oh, they didn't bring it out for you yet?? I can't believe it,\" while he walks over to the computer and orders the salad HE forgot to put in. I've lied to cover my ass, too, but is this dude serious? In the meantime, the manager comes over to ask about whether or not a certain table had received their order, and the same bartender replies, \"Yes, I'm sure of it.\" No, he wasn't, because he then (right in front of me, again...doesn't anyone realize there's not a sound-proof screen between you and your guests at the bar?) jokes to a coworker, \"(Name) just asked (blah blah blah), and I'm like, I don't have a clue, like, I don't even know! [Table] 15, 14, what's the difference, right?\" 

It's also not that hard to serve someone a club soda instead of a water, and just as easy to tell the truth if you've made the simple mistake as everyone has. Which he did. Made the mistake, and lied about it.

So, service sucks. At least at the bar. Can't say for the rest of the restaurant, so maybe that's where ya'll have been sitting to give all these positive reviews. But if an Italian restaurant doesn't make a good meatball, I don't trust them unless the service sells me. Obviously that didn't happen. I only gave two stars because of the convenience, but I'm 2 for 2 on disliking just about everything about the bar atmosphere here.

Also, just for context, I'm a very good tipper and a pleasant guest at almost every place I dine at, unless something exceptionally aggravating happens throughout my experience. Ta-da."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance - awesome service an awesome food. We went there on a Monday and even though the staff failed to tell us about there 2 for $40 special (one app, two entrees and a bottle of wine) until too late we loved our meals.

Great place - hope it makes it because it was very empty when we went because there were no shows at Playhouse."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner before the show. Started in the bar for a few drinks. Great service. Our dinner was exceptional. Scallops and risotto and a lobster pasta dish. Very good. The only downside was the tiramisu. It was a little dry, but good enough to eat it all."}
{"text":"We ate here last night after going to a concert at Playhouse Square. The decor and location couldn't be better. I am compelled to write a review because I think their business could be much improved if they increased their portion sizes and worked on the prep. We left the restaurant feeling as if we had been ripped off. I am happy to pay higher prices if the value is there. I ordered Scallops with risotto and received 3 small scallops on a small bed of undercooked risotto. 29.95.   A small chopped salad was 9.50. 
Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at the restaurant to take my mom out for a nice dinner that we were both excited about. We were seated by a very polite hostess, And sat at the table for fifteen minutes without being addressed at all. This was the worst service or lack there of I have ever gotten. You would have expected more from such a high end restaurant. Extremely disappointed with the lack of service. May I add they were not very busy at all so there was no reason not to even be addressed. We then proceeded to walk out because we were never approached at our table and went across the street and had an awesome meal."}
{"text":"I SO enjoyed my meal there! My daughter and I have gone to a million restaurants this week for our winter staycation, and I think this was our fave. The only reason I gave 4, not 5 stars - is parking is annoying. $8 to valet. Bummer. Anyway, they totally accommodated my vegan diet and my daughter loved her pasta and the ambiance is AWESOME!!  Such a beautiful place!  The staff couldn't have been friendlier!!"}
{"text":"To preface this review, I came in hoping for a quick dinner before Game 3 of NBA finals. It was not quick. Marks off for slow service and a lack of urgency by the staff.

Food was decent, seasoned but not special. Staff kind. Environment clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Went here after a yelp event and as soon I looked at the menu I thought whew just a little on the higher side of what I wanted to pay, because all I wanted was a good happy hour. Let me start again.....When I walked in I was greeted by this rustic interior with very high ceilings and super comfortable chairs that were just amazing. We were seated at the tables and the server was very attentive, but upon glancing at the menu my spirit dampered, because I just wanted a good happy hour spot, so we decided to leave and search the downtown area for our next restaurant victim. After exiting out the door the Manager came out and asked us how our experience was and presented us with cute little coupon cards for our next visit. We asked about happy hour and he explained that have late happy hour hours from 7:30-9:30 at the bar only and invited us to come back in and take a look at the menu.

We obliged and it was the best decision we could have made. We ended up with a bar full of meatballs, arancini, mussels, calamari fritte, and I had a nice birra! The arancini and mussels blew me away and the vingeratte sauce they served with calamari was soooo good. Everything was aromatic and foodgasmic!!! The service was excellent as well. Our bartender chatted with us and answered any questions we had and made us feel really comfortable. I couldn't have been happier or any fuller. The swirling activities around us, the light music, the laughter and lights: There was just something comfortable about this place. They succeeded in making me feel completely satisfied. I will definitely be back in the next few weeks to use my surprise coupon and enjoy a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Wasn't too pleased with my visit here. It was a Sunday night and my friend and I were the only ones there. The host threw silverware on our table saying \"you two probably don't care about set up do you?\" when we did... as it was a night for celebration. didn't even get offered bread! It was all slow and poor service, and the food was cold. Not going back. AWFUL!!!"}
{"text":"We went there the Friday after their opening for dinner.  Made an 8:30pm reservation, but it was not needed (only about 25% full).  I really wanted to like this restaurant.  Some good, some not so good. 

First the good.  Great renovation of the former Bricco space. Loved the attention to detail and the Tuscan atmosphere.  We ordered the bruschetta sampler for an appetizer, an arugula salad, the bolognese pasta, and the featured whitefish in a tapenade. The food quality was excellent.  

Unfortunately, the extremely poor service ruined the meal for us. Should have known from the beginning - it took almost 10 minutes from the time we were seated to be greeted by our server.  And then it was a I'll be back to help which was 5   more minutes.  No water service or anything (saw a couple of workers just standing around too - again,  only 25% full).  

Finally had the waiter at the table. Didn't know the wine list, didn't know the drink list, didn't know all of the food. At the price point of this restaurant ($25 - $30 entrees), this is unacceptable.   That's why you train before you open - he must have said 5 or 6 times that they were new and he just didn't know.   We noticed the table next to us was having service issues too.

Because of his confusion, the food was paced poorly.  To show the disconnect,  the manager came to check on us BEFORE we had even started to get our food - 45 minutes into our dinner! He never came back (too busy chatting with the hostess).  In fact, when he asked us on the way out (2 plus hours after we arrived) how our experience was and we told him about the very poor service (after we paid the $150 bill in full), he also reiterated they were new and still \"working on it\"! 

If someone doesn't wake up fast this place will die quickly.   When theater season hits there can't be such ineptitude.  Too many other good options. 

Let's hope the owner reads this and gets the right management in place.  Great food, great atmosphere, great location - please fix the service!"}
{"text":"Was very satisfied with everything at Cibreo Italian Kitchen. Food was outstanding, the atmosphere was superb, and the wait staff was the best I've experienced in a long time.  We will definitely be back time and time again.  The prices were great, too!"}
{"text":"So I never, Ever write reviews...but this was worth taking time out my day to do!!! I ordered chicken alfredo... easy enough right? I work downtown and ordered on my break, so the chicken literally has no seasoning and tasted like the chicken from a Campbells soup can, the meat had a purple tint and was shiny, and slimy, gross... huge chunks or garlic and onions....alfredo was watery with no flavor, for $20.00, NEVER COMING BACK, not to mention you would think at least the portion would be decent..."}
{"text":"Visited here last evening before a play. Setup a reservation and used the valet service which conveniently brings your car to you across the street after the play. Convenient to say the least.

Having said that, I was not impressed at all. The all-show room-temp water bottles...please stop it or at least make the water cold. 

Meatball appetizer was weird. Two medium-sized meatballs in a marinara sauce...neither all that great...no spoon? The \"bread\" was just old-tasting and stale in consistency. Gross. 

The strip steak was cooked well and of good origins but just otherwise not that good (too herby for my taste). The chicken parm or whatever the heck that was on the other side of the table looked (and tasted like) someone burnt the breaded chicken (badly), then refrigerated it, then added cheese, then put it in the microwave for 20 minutes with a paper towel directly on top of the cheese. Hard, perforated-looking cheese over charred chicken breading. 

The waitstaff uniforms are very costumey and just add to the even bad-executed pretention in the air....as for the customers, it's the bob evan's of olive gardens. All were nearly twice my age or more. 

It's just insulting to me honestly."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Cibreo !  My date and I dined here before attending the Cleveland Orchestra on 9/30/17, and the service and food was amazing.  They were even kind enough to push our reservations out 15 min when I phoned them and let them know we were running a few minutes behind. I had the Ricotta Gnocchi, and couldn't have been happier.  Absolutely delicious, and the portion size wasn't overkill.  I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and loved it.  The maître'd, Andrew, was extremely helpful and friendly and the waiter, Jay, was knowledgeable and attentive. My wife and I split the calamari which was excellent and she had the bolognese and I had the osso bucco and both were great. The cocktails, wines, desserts (I recommend the gelatos) and coffee were top-notch. A fun place to stop for an evening before the theater or just to enjoy dinner. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My company just had a banquet at this restaurant tonight, we work in the commercial food service field and see a lot of restaurants. I am an Chef that comes from an Italian background. I was a chef with Boca and Sotto in Cincinnati for eight years. Tonight was my first time here and I was pretty skeptical because I've eaten at Cibreo in Florence Italy. A good friend of mine that owns Via Vite, Forno Osteria, and Americano in Cincinnati used to be the chef at Cibreo in Firenze. 

I was not disappointed. The short rib and polenta was out of this world, as well as the seafood risotto and the service was great too. Our server and the manager were incredibly engaging and it was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long long time!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cibreo many times for private events...but never to have dinner.  I ordered the pasta carbonara which they advised me was not made with egg (not sure how it is still called a carbonara then...). Very rich.  Good.  The Caprese salad was very good.  Service was great...they asked if we were heading to the theater to manage our experience which we appreciated very much.  My boyfriend got the chicken parm.  Huge portion and it was very good.  The meatballs were on the cold side...bummer.  But overall, a very nice dinner.  I still prefer the small, intimate experience and food quality of Mama Catena in Euclid over a place the size of Cibreo.  But if you need a moderately priced Italian place and don't want to shell out the dimes to eat at Chinato, go here."}
{"text":"It's a lovely building in playhouse square and the ambiance is great. However, the food is disappointing. The cheese tray was pretty delicious to start, but the main courses were severely lacking. My salmon was majorly overcooked and the lentils were tasteless. We had a server who was new and consistently floated by our table, but he didn't notice the food was untouched. Luckily a manager came over, apologized and took the item off the bill. He also offered us dessert but we declined.  Before we left another manager had come over and asked about our experience. I was impressed with how swiftly and easily they handled the compliant, but would have expected the charred piece of fish to be noticed prior to serving. I expected more from this fancy place. Giving it 2 stars for the management, cheese plate and ambiance."}
{"text":"Dined here last evening with a friend before attending a show at Playhouse Square.  We opted to order from the Monday dinner special of 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 bottle of wine for $40.  We were not disappointed!  We opted for the arancini appetizer and it was delicious...the sauce was very flavorful, the arancini nice and crisp on the outside and the inside was soft, creamy and delicious!  My friend opted for the papperdelle pasta with bolognese and she thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  The papperdelle was nice and thin and held the flavorful sauce well.  I opted for the salmon with a tomato jus and a pasta similar to cous cous lightly coated with pesto.  Salmon was cooked perfectly (I had asked for medium/well) and the dish was very flavorful.  The biggest surprise, I think for us, was how good the bottle of wine was.  I mean, really!!!, for the price of the dinners including the wine we were impressed.  Some have commented that the portions were small but we did not find this to be the case all.  We had the Cabernet, brand was Vista Point, and found it to be very light, slightly fruity and very easy to drink.  Based on last evening's meal I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cibreo has really great food. I've been there a dozen times and I've never been disappointed. Great food and good drinks, great service, amazing ambiance and atmosphere. If you like Italian food you will love it."}
{"text":"Hummm...really nice restaurant inside, a little pricey $$$, and the food is average.  When we were there (7:00 pm), the place was almost empty except for 6 other people!  Would I make a special trip to go there when back in Cleveland...nope.  I guess it stays in business because it's located in the Theater District and there's not a lot of options close by.  (Note: I would probably eat at home before I saw a show.)"}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Polite, responsive, anticipatory but not hovering. I had gnocchi. It was very flavorful & the portion size was decent. My dinner companion had risotto which was good, not great. I will definitely try it again. Tried to change to 4 stars but couldn't. This is a good restaurant but more 3.5 to 4."}
{"text":"My experience at Cibreo was great!  Both the food and service were excellent.  There were 6 of us in our dinner party and we had 5:30pm reservations prior to attending the Dazzle the District event just outside Cibreo's doors.  I loved the atmosphere and location.  Would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, impeccable service and the friendliest bartender west of the Hudson River.

Everything in the menu is exceptional and so sharing is a good idea."}
{"text":"6 of us ate here Wed Nov 29th before Broadway show directly across the street.  Had a reservation at 5:45 and were seated right away.  Candles on the table, comfortable chairs and very nice ambience.  Our server Taylor was excellent.  She new the menu and drink selections very well, good recommendations.  My Mule called the donkey here was excellent and was made with gin.  I had the salmon, my wife had the porcini truffle ravioli, both were excellent and beautifully presented.  Other guest enjoyed their meals.  Nice crusty bread served with dinner.  Tiramisu and cappuccinos were excellent too.  Taylor made sure we made it for our show time.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night in a group of 8 for a friends birthday and found everything to be phenomenal, which is why I really do not understand the people who had subpar experiences here. 

The ambiance alone makes this cozy restaurant worth checking out. Additionally, our waitress was fantastic and very attentive. Everyone at our table loved their food. We ordered everything from the cheesy garlic bread and meatball appetizer to the bronzini, salmon, bolognese, and chicken piccata entrees. I had the chicken piccata and was able to swap the five grain rice for linguine; it was all superb. I am shocked some people found the portions to be small here because I was hardly able to finish 3/4 of my meal, but it was so delicious I ate until I was about to explode. 

When the bill came everything turned out to be shockingly affordable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, we stopped off after another event and I'm not usually one for fancy places, but this place is just REALLY nice:) 

Cibreo is very attractive place; the architecture is very strong, yet soothing. The food is very tasty ( I had meatballs that tasted, for all intents and purposes, EXACTLY like the ones my Italian grandmother made. Just amazing.) The service was great, and the manager even came by to say hello. It was very nice.

This place is not cheap, but you get quality for your dollar, and as I said, the atmosphere is very attractive; a fine place to take a date or someone for a special evening out before you stop off  at a show at Playhouse Square. 

If you want to start an evening of culture right, start it with Cibreo!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for a friend's graduation from Ursuline college. The graduation was at CSU. Cibreo is located not to far from parking areas of the Wolstein center. Parking for the restaurant is NOT too great though. Only actual option was Valet. The atmosphere at Cibreo is very nice and rustic Italian feeling. The wine selection was decent. I ordered the garlic cheesy bread. Sooooo good!!!! Not a piece was left! For my entree, i played it safe and ordered the chicken parm. I did not regret it. The chicken portion was huge and the pasta was delicious. I would highly recommend it. I gave Cibreo four stars because the food was great but the service was excellent! Our waiters were very attentive and speedy with service. If you are looking for quality food that packs a punch of flavor and is presented exquisitely, I would recommend Cibreo!"}
{"text":"Do not expect to get a table any time within 3 hours of a show at Playhouse without a reservation. They basically take one or two reservations per night per table. Great atmosphere for couples or small groups of adults, not recommended for young children. The service is very attentive and are trained to give recommendations.

Now to the most important part... the food. A heart's worst nightmare. The starter bread is foccacia lightly sprinkled with sea salt, which was good with the pesto/butter/olive oil mixture. The bread was a little doughy. I then chose to start with the calamari, absolutely fantastic! Not greasy, a good crunch and served with a toasted lemon and aoili. I would go back only for that and I mean only for that. I then chose to the server's recommendation to get the scallops in a risotto with asparagus. My dining partners ordered the steak special and a salad with salmon. Both the scallops and steak were crusted heavily with salt, the asparagus was undercooked and the risotto was bland. I am normally a fairly easy stomach to please when it comes to food flavors and balance, but the only meal that tempted the taste buds was the simple salad and blackened salmon. A sad day."}
{"text":"So I'll give this place 4 stars. It had a very nice ambience. I loved the layout of the restaurant. It was very rustic. It looked cozy but not really. I sat a table for two across from my boyfriend and I felt like we were so far apart. Like this is not a place I wanna speak loudly in and I can't believe I'm complaining about lots of table space...but I am. I wish I was closer to the person I was with. 
So we started the night with cheesy garlic bread and it was phenomenal. It was accompanied by this tomato sauce. For my entree I ordered their ravioli with truffle and that was bomb.com! I was kinda disappointed because their menu was like 2 pages long but I still found the ravioli. I ate it all up. We skipped on dessert because we were so full. 

So overall the place is nice. I would have liked a better seating arrangement. The food was great however I wouldn't pay that much for what I got. Then again, it is downtown. My server was the best! So it's not one of my top pick restaurants but I would recommend it if you were going to see a show at playhouse square."}
{"text":"My family and I were here visiting and were craving Italian food and we found this restaurant online and let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint. My family got the lasagna, Tortalini and the pasta Bolognese for our entrees, each one of them were delicious! For appetizers we ordered the calamari and cheesy garlic bread and those were amazing too. The lasagna was one of the top 5 Langnas I've ever had. I look forward to visiting Cibreo again soon."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best.  I have had better Italian food at Olive Garden. My husband ordered mussels for an appetizer and the bruschetta was burnt. I had to ask waitress 3 times for lemon. Everything ala carte. The asparagus was a side and was very tough. The only nice thing was it was convenient to the theatre and nice to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very good meal here this evening.  I ordered the Branzini and she had the Salmon.   Branzini was served as two nice fillets on top of a bed of olives, kale and fingerling potatoes.  The salmon was served on a mix of wild rice and lentils.   The decor is rustic 'Tuscan' Italian, nicely done.   I would definitely come again if I come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Cibreo last night. We were the only people in the restaurant, after the theater crowd left.
Our service was horrible, from beginning to end. We waited 45 minutes for our food. There was four of us.
Our waitress Jeanette was so bad. Never did she approach us to say \"I'm sorry, it's taking so long. We had to continually ask Jeanette for refills on our soda and water. The food was mediocre. 
When it came time to pay we couldn't find Jeanette. Finally she came to the table with the check and walked away. We were trying to pay and she kept doing other things.
I would give this restaurant a 1 star and we will never return."}
{"text":"I went to a Cleveland Playhouse Show this past weekend and decided to get dinner at Cibreo before the show. I went with my mom and we decided to share a few plates and have a glass of wine. It was a last minute decision on a Saturday night (@ around 5:30) so I knew that there was a good chance there would be no tables. That happened to be the case so we went to the bar. About 5 minutes later the Maitre D came up to us saying that there was a table that became available. SCORE! 

I wasn't super hungry so we ordered the calamari, the salmon, and the zeppolli to split. All three of the dishes were delicious and we really enjoyed the wine selections. The waitress was really knowledgeable about the selections and gave my mother a great recommendation that she loved. 

We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta was tasty.  A good amount of tomatoes on each one, topped on what looked like an overlarge bagel-chip.  However, there were only four tiny pieces.  I wouldn't even qualify it as an appetizer, it was more like a snack.  That would be fine if the price was reasonable but $9 for this amount food is not reasonable.  $9 for a snack is insane, even for downtown food prices.  It's sad, too, because I love bruschetta and this place is close to where I work."}
{"text":"Went for the Hanna theatre show and this is conveniently located. The spicy diablo shrimp pasta dish was flavorful. My Alfredo pasta dish was yummy. The restaurant cleared out by 8 on a Saturday evening surprisingly. Cocktails were decent."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a small bite after the theatre. The restaurant has an inviting Tuscan theme.  We were promptly greeted and seated. We ordered the Calamari and Bruschetta appetizers.  The calamari was served with a vinegar based dipping sauce that was amazing.  We enjoyed both appetizers and are excited to return to try some entree selections.  The service was all around amazing.  Warm, friendly and attentive staff.  The manager stopped by our table and was very engaging to chat with. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great spot!

The Panzanella Salad is the best salad that I've had in my fairly long and diverse career of restaurant-going. I also had a cup of soup and the happy hour Chianti. This was the best.meal.ever before a 4-hour urban planning class.

The bartender was crazy-professional, maybe a bit too much so, but that is more my issue than theirs. It's one of those things similar to a situation where if you don't like waitstaff acting casual, then don't go to the Tilted Kilt and give the waitstaff a bad grade. That is the kind of thing that would make you an asshole, and/or your reviews worthless.

I'm already planning a return visit for that salad."}
{"text":"The food here is awful. I keep giving the the benefit of the doubt like a fool.  This review covers 3-4 visits over the last 12 months. Very consistent... Bad Go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Hey you guys! Go here, get here!

Nice street view of the theaters through a magnificent picture window by the cozy fireplace!
Exceptional service and management!
The food was... well...seriously... freakin awesome!

so you want details?
Starting with the fresh foccacia bread and bread sticks with creamy butter, dolloped with pesto and olive oil...shut up!

The four of us enjoyed the \"2 for $40\" menus which includes a bottle of wine, an appetizer to share and 2 dinners.  Monday madness!!!  Guess what? They cork your wine not sipped to go! 

I ordered the meatballs app and Carbonara dinner...So much food, we all took home lunch for tomorrow.  Ok, I can't say much more except grab a table and write your rave review.

lastly, It was my birthday so I had a choice of gelato. Nice, eh.  How about even nicer when the manager brought over the tiramisu (my FAV) and well.... all that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Got the filet mignon for ~$30. Ordered medium rare and topped with salt and pepper, nothing else. It appeared to be cooked well but it was tasteless and somehow partly dry. Not sure how that happened. The filet was not worth the money spent.

The restaurant itself, however, was quite beautiful and had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The location is great in the heart of the theatre district. The menu is interesting and the food good. But... the last two times there the waiter totally abandoned our table toward the end of the meal -- no offer of coffee or dessert or even a bill. Total abandonment. Never saw anything like this. In both cases we had to go to the maitre d' to get a bill then pay it, then hurry to reach our theatre seats in time. A major disconnect in the middle of an otherwise great evening. Two times in a row. Strange! In all fairness we did not have this problems on earlier visits, but the last two times yes."}
{"text":"We've been to a few other spots owned by the same group across the area, so we planned to visit Cibreo shortly after they opened in the old Bricco space. Our group of four was not disappointed. 

The decor has been updated from the prior space...I was particularly taken by the above-bar decor - curved wood reminiscent of stacked wine barrels, topped by wine barrels spelling out \"CIBREO\". 

We arrived early to meet our group, so we sat at the bar for a drink. The bar staff was friendly, professional, and attentive, and while we didn't order anything super complicated, they did serve my \"filthy\" martini just perfectly. Occasionally they taste like rocket fuel from not being shaken well enough, but this one was great.

We moved to our table - we came in after the pre-show rush, so it was quiet (we more or less had the place to ourselves).

I really cannot think of anything we DID NOT like. Panzanella salad, antipasto tray, bolognese, pork shank/osso bucco - everything was spot on. Service was excellent as well. Worth the try if you're headed out downtown. I give a 5-star, because I felt everything was well-planned and very well-executed."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the establishment and it happened to be our Anniversary and it will be our last. The decor was very nice! The host was pleasant but then it turned....
Our first clue should have been the place was not busy on a Saturday night at 7:00.
It took 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take our drink orders.
The server started calling us \"my friends\" and felt the need to touch my shoulder or back every time he came to the table. 
He brought the drinks, poured my wife's wine and splashed it all over the side of the glass and table cloth.
We ordered apps. Arancini and Calamari, and our salad a Caprese to share.
The apps came out in a timely manner.
3 Arancini about the size of a golf ball,
The first one I took was so hard and over fried I couldn't get my fork in it and it shot off my plate. When I finally got it cut, there was very little risotto inside mostly bread crumbs and cheese.
The other 2 were acceptable and prepared correctly although they had very little flavor.
I told the server and he brought replacements which were not any better.
I will say the Calimari was the only shining star of the entire meal. Crispy and tender and a nice crunch from adding cornmeal to the breading.
The Caprese Salad came. Disappointing!
Mozzarella precut from the manufacturer
bland vine tomato's. Whole basil leaves. Just plain lazy BOH (Back of House)!
Come on Chef!
The entree's were delivered.
I'm not even going to get into the actual names of the dishes because honestly I don't think it would have mattered what we ordered.
Mine was a lobster pasta with what I think was either pancetta or prosciutto..either way it over cooked and large slices..again lazy BOH staff.
My wife had a seafood risotto which had shrimp, lobster and scallop pieces.....really pieces? Why not use a small Bay Scallop? 
Once again BOH issue, if your going to mix those all together in a pasta make sure you have timing and the cook times right because what you served showed you don't know or don't care. Over cooked and chewy/rubbery. 
The Chef needs to revamp and retrain his staff....if he cares. 
While the over all experience was disappointing the server was pleasant and attentive which is why we still gave him a very respectable tip.
I normally give a place that has some redeeming qualities 3 chances.
Not so with this place. We will not be back. 
If we wanted Italian we should have gone to Little Italy."}
{"text":"This place was beautifully decorated.  Feels like you stepped into Italy. The service was really good and the managers were very visible walking around and talking to the customers. The bread was very fresh and they give you a butter oil and pesto to dip the bread into which was delicious! 

We have a table of eight pre-show at Playhouse Square. Seven of the meals came out together on time they forgot one.  One other person's meal was cold which had to be sent back to be heated up.  10 minutes later the late meal came out but they didn't offer her anything which she waited, then no discount or dessert offered after. We were half done with our meals by the time she actually got hers. I got the pasta carbonara, which was very bland, and had very little sauce. Asked for fresh ground pepper and grated cheese and it was better, as there was no salt-and-pepper on the table to spice it up.  It had rotisserie chicken in it which I really wasn't a fan of. Pasta was perfectly cooked however. Everyone else was happy with their food once it was finally headed up and arrived. I would give this place a second chance hoping maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Visited as a part of night out with co-workers, had the bolagnese which was excellent, portions were generous the quality was spot on.  Nice wine selection with reasonably priced bottles of red, definitely a place to grab a quickie before the theater, or spend a few hours s the ambiance is very nice as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  We sat at the bar since we didn't have reservations and Katie took great care of us and her suggestions were spot on!  The seafood risotto was the best thing I've had out in a long time......we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Overall, 4/5.

We had reservations for a group of 6. Unfortunately 6 sometimes means 4 in Chinese culture. No problem, the staff was extremely nice and was amendable to change. =D We were seated quickly.

This week is restaurant week in Cleveland. While main dishes usually are around the 18-25 dollar range, the deal we have was 3 course meal (appetizer, main, dessert) for $30. 

We were sharing dishes so we got to try a bit of everything! 

Appetizer: 5/5.
Blew my mind. Sausage, Kale and porcini soup was very very good and filling. They give you bread on the side so PLEASE DIP IT IN THE SOUP. Also, the veal meatballs were outta this world (granted, I never had veal meatballs before, but they were good!).

Main: 4/5.
Veal saltimbocca was kinda average. However, the seafood linguini with mussels, clams, shrimp was very well done. None of this overly buttered and insipid linguini you find in other restaurants. This is the real deal. Tastes very delicate, without anything that jars your palate (like veal, for example). 

Appetizer: 3/5.
Nothing special. Tiramisu was ok, but below average. Red wine poached pear was OK.

Overall, solid 4. 

Side note: Decour is very classy. Dress smart casual. Waiters are extremely professional and highly attentive/responsive."}
{"text":"Went here with my family before a show and was disappointed at the food and service which had been good  in the past. The lamb and gnocchi entree had large chunks of lamb in lieu of the shredded small prices which were over cooked and didn't taste well. The bolognesse was dry and had almost no meat. Our server never refilled our waters and offered a second round of drunk after half the first round came out halfway through the meal. Upside was the appetizers were good as usual. However, is over priced for the food and service."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous restaurant! If you haven't seen it yet, you have to go see all the work they put into this place... gorgeous. 

We stopped in after a Yelp event across the street at PlayhouseSquare--I purchased a large cheese and meat board from their catering menu and I'm guessing it was delicious, since it was all gone in about 10 minutes. 

The happy hour (7:30-9:30pm, I think?) is BAD ASS. We're talking about $5 cocktails that will knock your socks off. Try the tequila-based one... sounds weird for an Italian restaurant, but I promise you it's perfection--and a little dangerous because it goes down easy! They also have some discounted appetizers that looked delicious. Furthermore, I absolutely LOVE the happy hour time frame. It works much better for my schedule. 

We also ordered dinner and was not disappointed in the least bit. We started with the calamari--I'm not a huge fan of calamari, so honestly, I could take or leave this dish. The funghi risotto on the other hand was perfectly prepared, packed with healthy veggies like kale, roasted tomatoes and mushrooms, all blended into creamy risotto. It was very good! My dining partners tried the bolognese, which I think was definitely a winner, and the grilled vegetable lasagna.

I can't wait to come back to try their pasta dishes--and I'm reserving that 5th star for that experience."}
{"text":"Was totaly disappointed with the service or lack thereof.  We had 5:00 PM dinner reservations for 4 because we had 6:30 PM theater tickets.  We arrived promptly and ordered wine and 2 appetizers and our entrees. The appetizers and bread arrived relatively promptly and were good.   Around 5:50 our waiter said our entrees would be right out at about the same time he brought entrees to the table next to us and had to take 1 back and he didn't reappear for 10-15 minutes.  At about 6:05 we the asked him about our entrees and he said he would go and check and he never returned.

I went and found the manager about 10 minutes later and told him we had theater tickets and did not have time for the entrees and he seemed surprised and explained they had been hit by a crowd all at once and that was why service was slow.  He offered to comp the appetizers and wanted to know if anything else was wrong.  

I really did not know how to answer.  We sat for over an hour, never got our entrees, our waiter wasn't really attentive.  The restaurant seemed surprised that the people attending the theater all arrived at one time despite the fact this happens 5 or 6 nights a week.   I truly do not understand how a restaurant that caters to a theater crowd can be so unaware of the time constraints of their clientele"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat before seeing a show at the theater but I'd recommend going early (if a couple) or making a reservation (especially for a group of 4 or more).  We were able to get seating for 2 outside.  We went around 5pm and the sun was in our eyes for about half the meal.  The food was excellent and the waitress fun and could answer all our questions. She had great recommendations and I even changed my mind on my meal when she described the special. My boyfriend's filet (which I sampled) literally melted in my mouth. The shrimp I had was delicious although I would have preferred the tails removed. Bathrooms clean and well-kept. Overall nice atmosphere, I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I know others be hatin' on Cibreo, but I've enjoyed my visits here. Most recently we stopped in before a show at Playhouse and grabbed two spots at the bar. They have happy hour from 3-6pm so we were able to grab some tasty calamari for $5.50 and a a strawberry collins cocktail for $5. I liked that the calamari came with this vinegar dipping sauce, since the dish was fried this worked even better than the typical aioli that you would get (vinegar helps cut the fatty taste). 

For main course I splurged and got the lobster pasta for $27.49. Definitely pricey, but it was a hearty dish and tasted good. My dining companion got a fish dish for the same price and they enjoyed their meal as well. You also get bread and spread to snack on. 

I think one thing that stood out to me was the service. Immediately upon our arrival at the bar the staff was on top of things and personable. This lasted our entire visit and I was happy to leave a nice tip. 

I would definitely come back here! I think happy hour is a great deal (plenty of options for around $5), staff is friendly, and it's close to the theatre. I'd like to check out their 2 for $40 on Monday's special. It does fill up fast though, so get their early or make reservations."}
{"text":"The service was great. .  The food was well above par for simular restaurants.   The pesto is out of thisworld! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum and yum!   Order the Bronzini and thank me later!  So delicious.  Beautiful preparation.  We had a service snafu and the manager graciously comped our Chopped Salad- also very delicious!  The bread service with the pesto butter- mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Yelp.. This restaurant does not have outdoor seating! Please update your records."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how amazing this restaurant was. The service was impeccable, the food was to die for. I ordered the cap these salad and steak special which was cooked medium to perfection. The wine was delicious and the waitress was so friendly and helpful as was the manager who came to check on us as well. It was so good I'm seriously debating about eating there tonight again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday after a show.  Felt we were being rushed.  There were maybe three other tables seated.  They tried to take away my plate before I was finished and then dropped the check on us before even asking if we wanted desert of coffee."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere are all top notch! Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 8. In our party we had one vegetarian and one gluten free.  There were plenty of options for both.  From the drinks to the meals everything was great."}
{"text":"Very nice décor and great bar service.  I dined alone at the bar on a Monday, the day after their grand opening, Sunday, September 8th.  The drink was done perfect with the large ice cube that keeps the drink cold without watering it down quickly and the salmon I had was exceptional.  A nice beefy piece, done throughout and without two much garnish to override the delicious fish!  The servers were attentive and the bartender is a hoot!  The only drawback was they didn't have my favorite Italian dish, veal marsala :(. When they add this it'll be the perfect place for a classy evening at an affordable price!  Mungi"}
{"text":"Major disappointment.  It has a great location right across from Playhouse Square.  We had reservations on a theater night, before a show.  Informed our waiter of this.  The two people who walked in got seated immediately.  We had to wait.  Long wait once seated for our waiter to get our drink order.  Of course the wine we ordered was not available.  Long wait to get another.  Finally got to place our order.  Had to ask for bread while we were waiting.  Food was OK.  My risotto was poorly prepared.  The manager was asking all of the tables how their dinner was - except ours.  Lucky for her.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Three stars for food and service and four stars for ambiance.  The restaurant is situated across from Playhouse Square and is perfect for dinner before a show though it can be hard to get reservation but you can dine at the bar if you dine early.  One tip is if you use the playhouse square valet you get to pay only 8 instead of 20, once you bring a Cibreo receipt of more than 30$ they give 12$ back. The aracini was a fried treat. The chicken parmesan was comforting and i like the marinara they make.  I know there's better Italian restaurants in town but this was great preshow option."}
{"text":"Great lunch time spot. I had the trio - soup, salad and half panini. It is was $13. I had the pork sausage soup. It was tasty and had a light cream based base. The salad was a grape tomato, cucumber, capers and bread ensemble with a balsamic dressing. I was not crazy about the four cheese panini. It felt like there were barely two cheeses in there! If I do it over again, I'd go for the chicken option."}
{"text":"I highly suggest the Pan Seared Bronzini fish, fingerling potatoes, and pesto. The fish was perfectly grilled and the pesto is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is great! It is a little pricey at night, but really not that bad. My fiancé and I got the arancini app, veal meatball app, and side of pasta (generous portion that we split between the two of us) a glass of wine, a glass of champagne and house made gelato."}
{"text":"Pretty good italian restaurant located across the street from playhouse square.

The food was amazing with chicken parmigiano being a standout. One of the best versions I've ever tried. The calamari was very well done. Loved the lightness of the calamari's batter. 

Cocktails and wine selection was very generous with my favorite being a ketel one orange moscow mule. Definitely addictive. 

Only complaint was the lackadaisical server. If service was better, would have definitely rated five stars.

One word of advice. Make reservations two weeks prior because restaurant is difficult to get into on weekends without reservations."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time with my family at Cibreo for an early dinner before a show.  Being 4:30pm on a Sunday, the place wasn't very busy, but we were seated at a nice table beside the fireplace (which wasn't on at the time but very beautiful anyways like really any spot in this restaurant!)  

Our server, Michael, was wonderful and attentive with recommendations and all sorts of information about the menu. Our dinner kicked off with the breadsticks + foccacia plus butter, pesto, and olive oil spread and two salads split 4-ways. (We got the Cibreo house salad and the pazannella - both great!)

For our entrees, each of the four of us ordered something different: dad with lasagna, sister with carbonara, mom with shrimp and polenta, and you-know-who with the bolognese. (See, one great thing about my family is we are all cool with and want to try each other's dishes!) All of our entrees were enjoyed and I wouldn't hesitate to order any of them again although I think next time I'll have to try something new! I mean, c'mon - lamb with riccotta gnocchi anyone?!!

I would definitely recommend Cibreo to anyone attending a show at Playhouse Square or just looking for some good Italian fare in downtown."}
{"text":"Dined at Cibreo, pre-show, for the first time last night for a birthday celebration for a friend.  Reservations were for 5:45 and when we arrived 20 minutes early they were able and happy to accommodate us.  I had a wonderful grapefruit and simple-syrup based cocktail and my companion chose a lovely Moscato.  Bread came with butter and fresh olive oil and pesto, which were a perfect complement to the soft, rustic bread.  She chose the Tortellini Alfredo with grilled chicken and I chose the Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both entrees were excellent, and the lemon used in the tortellini was an absolutely brilliant addition to the cream sauce.  My gnocchi was fantastic and the addition of pork tenderloin to the dish really sealed the deliciousness for me.  My only complaint about the food was that both dishes were a tad overly salted.  Just a touch less would have made the entrees perfection and probably have garnered this review five stars instead of four. 

Ambiance is on point in this establishment.  Restaurant is spacious, well-lit but not ostentatious, provides ample seating yet enough privacy for an intimate dinner date.  Any restaurant playing Frankie and Deano gets two thumbs up from me and the music was played at the perfect volume.  Other reviews have discussed service issues at Cibreo but I saw the opposite last night - server was attentive and speedy without being overbearing.  Manager on duty stopped by to inquire about our meals and was friendly and conversational.  

I will absolutely be returning to Cibreo the next time I'm seeing a fantastic show at Playhouse Square. ."}
{"text":"Wine was definitely good! Carbonara was yummy. Sister had the lobster risotto - also good. Dessert was fried donut things with a trio of sauce options (chocolate, raspberry, and cinnamon). All were good. Nothing amazing- but definitely would eat here again with zero complaints."}
{"text":"Dinner before the show was good, not great. Service was a little pokey, waited way to long to process paying the check..."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after a play and I have to rave about this place! The asparagus risotto I had was outstanding. 
I was in with five other people and we all enjoyed our experience! Great service, great food, beautiful restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely thrilled with this latest addition to the growing list of dining options available in Playhouse Square!  The remodel is breathtaking, with gorgeous stone arches and rustic wooden tables.  From the moment the Pete Campbell-esque maître d seats you, you're in good hands.  Super attentive and knowledgeable wait staff were a joy.  Knowing our intention was to share the dish, our waiter even took the time to make sure our risotto was served into two separate bowls for us!  The pasta options that we tried were truly delicious.  The boar pappardelle was perfect (FYI, sauce has a little bite to it) and the pesto is outstanding!  Some of the best I've ever had!  A reservation is a good idea if you're looking to dine here before or after a show.  So proud to have such a beautiful and classy new restaurant in Cleveland.  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to love the service and hate the food?

Disclaimer: I love all Italian foods and it's got to be terrible for me not to love pasta. 

With that said, service was great. Prompt bread and drink service. And the waiter was quite attentive. 

On to the food, the cheesy garlic bread app was bread and cheese foil. The cheese was stuck on the foil and when you went to get a slice, only soggy bread came loose. Such a shame

As for my entree, gnocchi tasted hard and stale. The pork was non existent and the sauce was bland. I would have returned it but had already down two drinks and wasn't feeling too impress that the food was going to get any better. So. Boo and big dumbs down to the chef. 

Such a shame the food is terrible. I guess they figure they will stay in business since it's right across the street from the play house. The reason we chose this place."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Cibreo. The location in Playhouse Square is wonderful, and I loved the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant. The chic Italian vibe was very romantic, and the restaurant is pristine. 

I went with a large group (15) and we sat in the private room upstairs. It was a little snug, but the room was nice for a business lunch. We also placed our orders in advance to ensure we wouldn't have to wait too long for service. It was a bit disappointing that they still missed one of the orders, and by the time it was brought to our guest, we were wrapping our meal up. 

While the food was flavorful, the portions were very small for the price. I was pretty surprised to have exactly 8 small pieces of tortellini on my plate, and my friend and I ended up going to purchase a snack an hour later. Side note--I have heard fantastic things about Cibreo's happy hour, and I am looking forward to returning back for that! They seem to have an extensive wine and cocktail menu, making them worthy of a second look."}
{"text":"You know the guys from high school who looked gorgeous, smelled great and wore their Levi's perfectly? Then they asked you out. Oy. Vapid. Nothing there...all smoke and mirrors.

This is Cibreo. 

Loved the location, the look, the interior, the little outdoor patio, and the server uniforms. Even the font for their logo made me giddy.

I was ready for a culinary treat. 

Sigh. Huge letdown. 

The fact that we sat for 10 minutes before being given water is forgivable. Shift change. The manager even gave us an apology appetizer.

But things didn't change. The bartender was not only tending bar inside, but also waiting on our table outside. Weird. There were two other servers working the patio (which seats around 6 tables). 

Why would you pull the inside bartender  to work the outside patio? Puzzling. 

The apology appetizer, a bruschetta, was really good.  Bread was perfectly crisp, not hard. The tomatoes and seasoning refreshing and tasty, and the balsamic reduction on the plate required full bread swiping...no waste...it was too good. 

My dish, a tortellini topped with blackened chicken rates a 2 on a 5 scale. The tortellini was slightly undercooked, flavors had no depth, the pops of heat from pepper ribbons were too much and the chicken was dry. Just because  it's blackened doesn't mean it should be dry. Poor little chicken. Gave his life for this meal...he deserves respect. 

My dinner companion got lasagna. He gave it an okay but not worth the price. 

Throughout the rest of the meal the service  was weak, after dinner...waiting on check...service was weak. The manager was wonderfully apologetic, but that only goes so far. Fix it. 

So, we will not be going on a second date. Don't even call.  
No, it's okay, really...I can walk to the door myself."}
{"text":"I just wasn't thrilled. 

We went on a Saturday night and had reservations at 8pm for 8 people. We walked into a gorgeous huge restaurant with beautiful rustic decor, and the entire place was empty except for one other table of 2. Only 2 more parties were seated while we were there. At 8pm. On a Saturday night....

I got excited when I saw a Pino Nero listed in their wine section. I've only had it once before and was told it was a white Pino Noir at the restaurant I tried it at. When I asked the waiter if it was, in fact, the same wine I was thinking of, he looked at me funny and said \"There's no such thing as a white Pino Noir.\" I felt like an idiot in front of my friends. (I later googled it and discovered I was right all along)

As for the food, we all had something different, and none of us were thrilled. I ordered the scallops, as I ALWAYS do if a restaurant has them on their menu. They were small and not exceptionally flavorful. The risotto was undercooked, which is about as appealing as chewing on a mouthful of sand. 

We ordered zeppoli to share for dessert and it was dry, almost stale tasting and lacked imagination. 

The decor of this place is on point. The rest is mediocre at best. If a restaurant is going to be an Italian kitchen, I expect some serious authentic creativity. I felt like I was at a better accessorized Macaroni Grill. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow-so impressed with this place. I came here on a Wednesday night for dinner after reading great reviews for the restaurant on Yelp. Both the food and the service surpassed my expectations. 

Food: The menu offers a diverse set of options from salads and starters to traditional Italian meals. I started with the Cibreo salad (mixed greens, fennel, pecorino, pine nuts, light vinaigrette). It was super refreshing and was complimented nicely by the focaccia bread and breadsticks they brought out for the table. I ordered the salmon with lentils, radicchio, red onion, and kale chips for my entrée, which I loved. The portion sizes for both my salad and entrée were perfect, and I was impressed with the quality of the food. I ended up getting the zeppoli for dessert, and this was the only part of the meal that I didn't find amazing. The dough itself was wonderful, but the dipping sauces (whipped cream, chocolate ganache, and raspberry puree) were not great. I ended up eating most of the zeppoli plain, which was fine by me. 

Service: My waitress, Teresa, was fantastic. She was attentive without being overbearing and was very warm. A man that I assume was the manager of the restaurant stopped by my table to make sure I was enjoying my experience, which I appreciated. 

I definitely give this place five stars. Though it's a bit on the expensive side for Cleveland, the food is delicious, the staff is great, and the ambiance is hard to beat. I will definitely be returning here on future trips to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I came here during a business trip and it is definitely a classy restaurant. Based on their website, I tried to get the two for $40 dinner but I was told that is only for Monday's, which the website does not state nor does the coupon. I ordered the chicken Parmesan dinner and while the chicken was very good and crunchy the way I like it, the pasta was way overcooked. All in all four Cleveland, it's a pretty good restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, but menu needs to be more varied.  Also, service was good until I asked for the check and it seemed forever before it came.  Server should realize that many guests need to get back to work or to the theater."}
{"text":"We had Valentine's dinner here.  It was wonderful.  We started with meatballs which were perfect.  My husband had the salmon and I had the Cibreo Bolognese. He said his was good and that means something.  The Cibreo Bolognese had flat noodles which I wasn't expecting but they were perfectly cooked and the sauce was fantastic.  I am glad we chose Cibreo's."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  The interior is completely remodeled from the previous tenents, looking absolutely beautiful and creating a feeling of escape. The front windows frame the dazzling lights and hustle of the theatres across Euclid Avenue.

The food and drinks were awesome. I had a Moscow Mule -- the menu allows you to \"pick your poison,\" so I chose burbon instead of the usual vodka. It was delicious, and served in copper mug.  

We started off with the mussels and the steamed artichoke appetizers. Both were done perfectly, were beautifully seasoned, and were larger portions than I had anticipated --which is always a pleasant surprise!

I had the beef cheek with funghi risotto, and It. Was. Awesome. The cheek was perfectly cooked that when I cut into it, my knife just cut right through. No musclework required! 

The bronzini had deliciously crispy skin on the outside, tender and beautifully cooked fish on the inside. 

The Sienna was also flavorful, delicious, and topped perfectly -- not too much, not too little.  

Cibreo is a must!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my 3 friends before a 7:30 show.  When I made reservations, they did ask about the showtime, which I appreciated.  On the plus side, the food was excellent and the service outstanding!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to a mess up with my order - don't know if it was the waitperson or the kitchen, but I had to send it back.  They got it right the second time and did comp a dessert, which was appreciated.   We still made it on time to the show so I have no complaints.  I would return to try some of the other excellent dishes."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Started off very strong with cheese and salumi plate, fresh warm bread, delicious cocktails and great service. The calamari was excellent.  Arancini were unfortunately cold but when we mentioned that, the server immediately apologized and took them off the check.  Bolognese was fantastic - delicate fresh noodles and awesome sauce."}
{"text":"Beautiful place in a great spot. Seafood risotto was awful and balance of food ordered by our party of 8 was almost mediocre. Continually asking for drinks and then needing to remind the waiter that our drinks that we ordered 15 minutes ago hadn't arrived yet. Dinner took almost an hour to arrive with members of our party agitated by poor service instead of enjoying a special evening on the town. Give your hard-earned money to another establishment in the theatre district...the folks at Cibreo failed to impress"}
{"text":"First time here last night. Greeting upon arrival, excellent. Bar tender, excellent. The atmosphere, beautiful. Appetizers we got were, Calamari, which was heavenly. Aracini (spelling), eh. We were told we would have bread and butter, but took a LONG time to come. Ordered dinner, food was out of this world amazing. Service, well, 5 out of 10. Slow, not very informative. In a upscale establishment, you'd expect your servers to be spot on, well he was not. 
Had a group of 8, called a day before and asked to adjust the size by one or 2 and was told we couldn't because you were booked solid. Ha, nope! There were empty tables ALL night next to us. Valet parking, if you have it great, but tell the customers where you'll be at the end of the night so we can get our car. We had to run across the street in rain, tacky. Overall it was the food we will come back for."}
{"text":"In a word: Blah. Not terrible, but certainly nothing overwhelming. Skip it!

We tried 3 apps, bread and 2 desserts. Nothing was very good...not horrible, just blah. Mussels, arancini, meatballs, table bread, panna cotta, zeppoli. 

Interior was the same...blah...service, too. Just blah. (Awkward and ill-timed, actually...Applebee's caliber.)

We were uber-conscious of time (thanks to fellow yelpers) - we had reservations at 6:15 for a 7:30p show, and it worked out perfectly timing wise. Thankfully they sat us closer to 6p.

$80ish for 2 of us: 2 drinks, 3 apps, 2 desserts & 1 coffee. Blah. 

Really wish this was a Burntwood Tavern instead!"}
{"text":"I got the Caprese salad for lunch and it was really good. The tomatoes were heirloom tomatoes with thick slices of fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, olive oil and a balsamic glaze. It was tasty, but not as filling as I was hoping for. I wish there would have been a combo with it to add a soup or half sandwich."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give three stars simply due to the decor! It's absolutely gorgeous inside. I went with a large group on Thursday night - 6pm reservations for 12 with a 7:30pm curtain time. When I made the reservations I was told that it would be plenty of time. Our dishes were either bland or over-seasoned, entrees came out as appetizers and one appetizer came out as an entree. It took forever to get our bills. I realize that it takes work to split checks. If you can't do it efficiently then don't offer it as an option. We were nearly late for curtain time. I can't see heading here again with a large group. I may give it a try again with a small party and at a less busy time to see if there's a difference, but I'm not at fan at all at this point."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in a while. Best calamari I've ever had! No wait time, excellent service decent pricing. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, beautiful atmosphere.  Couldn't love it more!  Definitely expensive but it's not like you don't know that ahead of time.  Our waiter made the night.  He was kind and fun and explained everything on the menu and took my allergy restrictions seriously.  We would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"The food is all beyond amazing.  Truly one of Cleveland's best restaurants, and that is saying a lot.  The chef is talented, the decor is beautiful, the bar and cocktails are simply stunning.  Make this your next meal.  Favorites: Bolognese, Sausage + Bean Soup, and Gnocchi.  The cocktail list, especially the Bourbon section is stellar as well!"}
{"text":"If the service was better, would've given it 3 stars food wasn't bad nothing to write home about. Over priced and the portions for the scallops was a joke 4 for I think was $39. Won't go again. If you have money to waste go for it."}
{"text":"I remarked to my companions that this place was probably a place they melted down beta max players for scrap ten years ago. The transformation of Playhouse Square is truly awe inspiring. A park where once bums used to shimmy for change now hosts outdoor salsa dancing. Gorgeous public art, a giant chandelier, someone under 100 at Otto Moser's. And this kitchen is a vanguard of modernity and class. Until Hofbrauhaus opens and the area becomes the next west 6th(with brahs attending revivals of Death of a Salesman starring UFC fighter Johnny Leglock).

We were just in for a quick nosh and drank, so we settled in at the bar. Great view of Euclid. Never in my wildest childhood dreams could I have pictured this area as anything other than a Skidmark Row of weird frizzy haired old guys and women of ambiguous foreign origin rocking babushkas pushing a cart of Woolworth's brand mushroom soup. Now people wear actual suits here(cheap suits, on these Entourage wannabes), but suits none the less! Anyhow, back to the bar. We had some GLBC, a tart and crisp bourbon cocktail called a Louisville Cool I believe? Caprese salad, complimentary bread with exquisite dipping oil/butter/pesto, and a plate of calamari for me. The squid was some of the best I've ever had. The breading was more dainty than an understudy for Shrek the Musical(theater reference). Only a couple tentacles(which I've grown to accept and wolf down). Some places pull a major Italian party foul and give you nothing but limbs. A couple sprinkled in is just right. It came with an unobtrusive herby dipping sauce and a charred lemon. Motherfucker, you do not serve seafood without a lemon, you got that? We chowed, boozed, and relaxed. The space is like a PBS Create channel winery brought to life. Opulent, but casual. Our bartender/ de facto server was a lovely young gentleman. Polite, intelligent and enthusuastic about his customers. To have people like him working downtown is truly an asset to our city(there I go spewing off some of my resume cover letter jargon). But honestly, I mean every word. We had prompt service, great food and a surprisingly affordable bill(see Otto Moser's for what overcharging looks like). I would definitely come back anytime the theaters host a great show. Like Dr. Oz meets the Harlem Globetrotters. Make that happen, Playhouse Square."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. 

This place is operated by the Driftwood Restaurant group which owns many other local favourite places like 87 West at Crocker Park, Hodges downtown, etc... 

Mondays are 2 for $40 entrees plus a bottle of wine plus one appetiser. This is a great value! No reservations are needed Mondays, but other days they are required as the place gets busy with Playhouse Square customers our waiter said. Since this is an opentable.com restaurant a reservation is always a good idea! 

The decor in this place is simply stunning. You do not feel like you are in Cleveland any more. While the restaurant is on Euclid and there are big street level windows, turn your head in the other direction and you see brick, stone, candles, wood, and other earthen materials. Low ceilings and a cave like feeling make you feel like you are just off an little alley in Tuscany. 

The food is great as well. The portions were large. The flavour combinations were creative and great. My salmon was cooked perfectly as requested to medium well. The waiter alerted me that it is usually cooked medium and asked if that was okay with me... 

The happy hour menu looks like a great idea as well and runs late - 1930-2130 M-F in the bar. 

This place has been open since September and I cannot believe I did not experience it sooner. I cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The places looks really nicer.  The bread is good there comes with the cheese at the beginning of the meal.  The chicken Parmesan was not good.  Yes, we came right before they closed on a stormy night but the chicken was dry."}
{"text":"We had dinner here before seeing a show.  I would not recommend and would not return.  Service was average, not friendly and the staff seemed on edge with each other.  The mussels were chewy and tough.  The spaghetti with clams was disappointing.  The clams were good but the pasta and sauce were average.  There are so many good restaurants in Cleveland but I would not consider this one."}
{"text":"Went to Cibreo before a show at Playhouse Square and didn't have any issues on service or wait times, but the food seems a bit overpriced! Server was very friendly and helpful on menu items, but the food was just average."}
{"text":"My friend and I went prior to a show at that Playhouse. Highly recommended. Reservations are necessary but time was never an issue. I noticed the menu had a veal parm but not chicken. I asked our very friendly server if chicken was a possible substitution. The chef agreed! Came out perfect- large, flat and crisp! My friend ordered salmon and also liked it."}
{"text":"I am giving this 2 stars solely based on service. My friend and I sat at the bar to grab a quick glass of wine before we headed over to see a play. The bartender was sooooo rude to us and only us! Took about 15 minutes for us to get a drink and he made us seem like we were inconveniencing him. We were ready to leave and gave him the credit card...the card sat on the bar for 10 minutes while he was playing on his phone. I said 'excuse me, can you please ring us out, we are heading across the street for an 8:00 play'. Rude bartender responded with an eye roll and said 'yes, you and everyone else' in an extremely condescending tone. 

I would like to go back to try the food because it all looked very good but I definitely won't be sitting at the bar or dealing with him."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Service was decent- perfectly friendly but didn't ask if I would like a second glass of wine. I ordered the seafood risotto and my husband had the chicken parm.  The risotto tasted more like uncle bens cheesy rice than a true risotto cooked with wine and either fish or veggie stock. The scallop pieces in the risotto were hard and rubbery and gross. The chicken parm was nothing special and the breading was burnt on the edges. Zero flavor in the pasta sauce.  Overall, I can't justify spending $20-26 per entree with salad a la carte at this place. Yes, it is convenient if you have theater tickets but there are much better options close by."}
