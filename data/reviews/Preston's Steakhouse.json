{"text":"Decided to use our mailer for the buy one get one free Delmonico steak for my husbands birthday dinner.  While the food was very good, the service needs some work.  I had ordered my steak with blue cheese and despite asking for it three times, it was never brought to me!  Our water glasses remained empty throughout our entire meal as well.  And, while they brought us a complimentary birthday cake, they never asked if we'd like coffee or an after dinner drink!  In addition, the table next to ours had to send their steak back as it was served rare and he had ordered it well done. I certainly hope service improves as its nice to have options."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu, drinks and atmosphere. Had a Burger and I have to say it was very good, and only $8. Don't pass this place by. Definitely go check it out."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Been here 7 or 8 times and still enjoy the experience.  The outdoor 2nd floor patio w pinnacle peak views is a treat."}
{"text":"Nice decor.... My husband made reservations at least 4 days in advance. They had window seats with views... Hostess tried to put us at a small 2 top in the corner next to the kitchen/door.... We assumed when you make reservations and let them know it your 36th wedding anniversary that they would seat you somewhere memorable.... I ordered the crab dinner... Too salty... Didn't  want to complain again and ruin my hubbies evening that he tried so hard to arrange! Server was hard to find and we sat for long periods waiting on her:(:( ....We really wanted this place to be somewhere we would go for special times .... Bummer :(:(:("}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid 3 star rating. To start with,  5 stars goes to ambiance;  a star gets marked down from service, then another for 2/2 not so great salads with not so great overly oiled salmon fillets. Another star gets marked down for very badly executed fondue then another store is getting knocked out for the super greasy standard tasting \"chicken oysters\" another star gets knocked down due to the blatant halfing of my colleagues steaks, but added a star for an okay wine selection and the meat was seasoned well,  I'd give it one star but we paid too much for me to morally approve a one star review."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelor party with a group of guys from Boston... Really perfect experience. This was our last dinner of the trip and by far the best service we received in Arizona. Food was spectacular as was the free cake they provided at the end of the meal (equipped with a firework sparkler to add some effect). For dinner, I ordered the 22oz porterhouse lobster style and it may have been the best meal I've ever eaten. 

Pricey dinner but 100% worth it."}
{"text":"We have been to just about every steakhouse in the valley especially all of the overpriced places and hands down Preston's is the most affordable, bang for the buck you will find. The atmosphere is classy which is what you'd expect for a north Scottsdale steakhouse and it was busy but you didn't have to shout across the table to have a nice dinner conversation. The service was excellent, not pushy whatsoever and we were able to enjoy a nice meal at our leisure. The wine was reasonably priced and the food was definitely top notch. We had steaks and seafood and both were seasoned perfectly along with shareable sides that were too, excellent. The only negative was that one steak was slightly more done than the others but the quality of the meet overcame that. There are lots of choices for high-end steak joints in the valley but we will definitely come back to Prestons."}
{"text":"Have been here twice since their opening and have had 5 star experiences both times. I had the Delmonico the first time and the Rib Eye the second time. The table shared the Red Velvet Butter Cake and I have to say, it was amazing! I will definitely be back - and I can't wait to try out their happy hour in the bar!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in for the Happy Hour at the bar, which has ample seating for large parties and not just bar stools. The happy hour menu is almost as extensive as the standard bar menu and the price are incredible for what you get. We were first given some outstanding homemade smoked pepperoni sticks from the kitchen. The happy hour menu is great for picking a few small plates to share. The Pig Wings, slowly braised pork shank, were probably my favorite. We also had the BLT deviled eggs, the filet sliders and the fish tostadas. They also offer half-off burgers for happy hour where you can choose from any of their signature burgers. The namesake Preston burger is NOT to be missed. A freshly ground 8 oz. burger topped with swiss cheese, fried onions, mayonnaise and 6 ounces of Prime Rib! Amazing!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Wednesday night. The service was great and the food was excellent. Wednesday was 1/2 price wine night which was a plus. 
The only downside was being seating in a high traffic area when there was other seating available. For some reason we could not get moved."}
{"text":"Truly honest review. I was torn between giving 2 and 3 stars. I'll start by saying, including tip, my bill was upwards towards $200. The meal I received was not there. I eat out frequently and I'm not opposed to spending money on a good meal. There were some good aspects and I'll start with those. The shrimp cocktail was decent but worth $17 for 3 shrimp I'm not sure. The pig wings were delicious. But when it came to the steak, all I can say is...salt. Salty beyond belief. The side order of asparagus was lack luster and pretty flavorless. Also, I had ordered a titos and soda to drink which I got for the first round...when I got a second drink I was presented with a gin and tonic. I played it cool and told the server, but said I would drink it anyway. Overall, just not that great as far as service or food for the price point. There are other steak houses in town that nail it every time. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour with complimentary bread and sausage sticks. Great happy hour menu with good variety -large portions and free red velvet cake tastes as you leave. Great value for money and happy hour goes till 7:00. They have a generous amount of seating as well. Definitely go again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"4 people, 10 complaints. Undercooked entrees, forgotten orders, tasteless salads, extra charges on the bill.  Outback has far better food for a third the price."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Chose this restaurant from a friends recommendation list and our group was very pleased.
Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The waiter made a few suggestions. The meals came out perfect and served on some very hot plates with the coolest and sharpest steak knives ever. Even though we hung around after the meal was finished we never felt rushed to leave.
This place is very clean and I recommend it.
Price was very reasonable for a mid to upper end steakhouse"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  First the steak was over cooked and then it was sent out basically raw. No compensation from the management.  No real apology either.  We paid 10.00 for less then a third cup of mashed sweet potato's.  It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"A little \"pricey\" as all steakhouses seem to be these days, but,  a relative good value for its price point.  Attentive service helped, too.  Will go back.....especially IF the wine list ever got a \"little more reasonable\"."}
{"text":"Nice upstairs, downstairs bar and dining room needs updating. Not comparable to elegance and upscale Mastros across the street, although prices are similar. Pet peeve.....every single item on the menu is \"$17.99\" or \"$42.99.\"  The 99 cents seems out of place.....more fitting for a diner or auto dealership!  Spent $200 and felt spending a little more at nearby steakhouses like Fleming's and Mastro's would have been better. Entered bar to have an after dinner drink at 7:30 and after 10 minutes, we left. No service. We will most likely try this place again in the near future for Happy Hour and the upstairs patio. But for a high quality steak experience, there are better choices."}
{"text":"We started the evening with happy hour drinks and hors d' oeuvres, the bar downstairs was full so they sent us up a long flight of stairs to the upper bar.  Drinks were pricey but the pour was generous. We tried the pretzel fondue which we wouldn't have again. 

The dining room is pleasant enough, but they showed us to a terrible table for two against a wall and close to the kitchen.  We declined the table and were taken to a better one (thank goodness).  We both ordered the Delmonico and a side (nothing comes with the steak).  We found the meat cooked to order and acceptable but nowhere close to exceptional.  The side we ordered was OK but again, nothing I would return for.  There are so many great Steakhouses in Scottsdale, I am taking this one off my list and won't be returning.  In my opinion they are overpriced and we were underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I frequent Preston's on an average of three times per month.  Overall, the experience is always good to excellent.  However, this past Saturday has left me doubting management.  We had guests in town, and decided to take them to the aforementioned.  Sitting in the main dinning area,two couples in close proximity, were well underdressed for a Saturday evening....tee shirts and shorts underdressed.  One of these couples, acted as they dressed.  Not the place to impress visiting friends.  Management, if you read this, just some advice, three competitors, a very short distance from you, respect their customers by imposing a dress code."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of the steakhouses in Scottsdale and nothing comes close to this place. Everything tastes amazing and it's always reliable. Service is sometimes inconsistent but the food makes up for it. Best steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Scottsdale! Huge menu with tons of great choices and generous servings. The staff is great too. The \"pig wings\" are to die for and the butter cake is heaven. It's awesome to have a great restaurant in the Citadel again."}
{"text":"Another good news, bad news review.  The good news...The food is really good.  The bad news...it takes FOREVER to get it! We were told fresh bread was in the process of being baked and would be coming to the table shortly.  But it didn't come for at least 20 minutes and some of the \"freshly baked bread\" was actually cold, like from the refrigerator, cold.  The salad didn't come to the table for at least 30 minutes. The entrees took an hour to get.  Our potato was served cold and by the time they brought another potato, my prime rib was cold.  We were not offered coffee, the waitress was never available, and the other bus boys/servers behaved as if it was their first day on the job.  This is our second try at Preston's and our last.  Even though the food is good, for the same money, we will go to Flemings, Mastro's or Donovan's.  These restaurants consistently serve excellent food AND provide impeccable service."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  The happy hour is crazy good and worth it!  The manager is personable and the servers/bussers are very attentive!  I recommend the prime rib Sunday or Monday.  I get lamb fondue too with a pretty dirty martini for the perfect night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first visit to this restaurant on 9/8 during the daily happy hour, on the recommendation of a friend.  We were not disappointed. The happy hour food and cocktails are fabulous. I had a blueberry lemon drop martini and it was exceptionally good! We ordered the filet sliders, crab cake sliders and chicken oysters. All the food was excellent! The service was prompt and courteous. We can't wait to visit Preston's again and would recommend highly."}
{"text":"Preston's is a great addition to a growing corner at Pima and Pinnacle Peak.  My friends and I meet frequently at the bar, where the service is superior.  We're all light eaters, and love Preston's bar menu.  The prime rib sliders are excellent, as are the fries and fried green beans.  Everything we've tried has been great, and we love the ambiance.  Also, happy hour goes until 7!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and amazing happy hour. Good alternative to other local upscale dining"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service & The food was great!  I recommend that you try the colossal shrimp cocktail appetizer which is the best that I have ever had"}
{"text":"Went to Preston's for another birthday and they were awesome again!!  Never a disappointment!  We had Rebecca as our server, and she was the BEST!!  Will definitely ask for her again, altho everyone has been great!"}
{"text":"On a recent family vacation to the Phoenix area, Preston's put other steakhouses to shame! I want to ding Preston's several stars because they've ruined steakhouses in Seattle for me, but... I won't. ;-)

We had a large group of seven and Preston's easily accommodated us without reservations on a Monday night. The service was stellar - our waiter was funny, friendly, and informative - and the food impeccable. Even the care taken when packaging up our leftovers was impressive. 

Drinks were plentiful, and I personally appreciated the wine selections. Being from Washington, I always seek out Washington and Pacific Northwest wines, and Preston's had several from which to choose, all reasonably priced.

Our steaks were all cooked perfectly as ordered, and our group selected a variety of cuts and types. The proprietary seasoning added a depth of flavor and almost a thin sort of crust on the steaks which complemented and enhanced the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture of the beef. 

The side dishes, from mac and cheese to mashed potatoes and other veggies, were flavorful and large enough to share among more than two people. 

This was the meal of a lifetime for our family and we'll be sure to return on our next trip to the area."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the blueberry lemon drop? TO DIE FOR! I had three and would probably have had more if they hadn't closed."}
{"text":"This was our first time here; I was looking for a place last minute for NYE's.  I made the reservation first, then called to see if they had a pre-menu.  I was very happy to hear they were using their regular menu.  
When we got  there at 530pm, even though our reservation was at 545pm, we were seated right away.  The server came over right away, explained a little about the menu but was to the point w/o being rude, we got our water & bread right away & other drinks.  The server took our food order, and as we waited, we noticed there is an upstairs, and the noise level inside was pleasant; not overpowering.  
The sides are large for 2 to share & extremely good.  We both got steaks; filet & prime rib.  Both were prepared extremely well, great flavor.  The staff is attentive w/o being overbearing.
For being our first time there, we would definitely go back again for a special occasion.  They brought out a butter pound cake for dessert, on the house, for being first time guests.
It was a wonderful experience, and while a little out of the way for us, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Let's just say food is great!  Management sucks! Especially steve. He is ridiculous and awful. If I you want to be turned off or disrespected you should speak to him. We have been there 3 times since we discovered this place in 3 weeks. Now we struggle with food is good but overall concept and business is horrible and that is worse than bad food. This guy had terrible customer - /.000"}
{"text":"We have become a fan of Preston's lately.  They have great food and the service is also always very good.  Excellent place to eat for any occasion.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to many steakhouses in many cities including Phoenix and Scottsdale but I have to say that this steakhouse least resembles a steakhouse. 
The decor is plain and does not have the lighting to make it look attractive even in dimmer lighting. 
The food is nothing to rave about.  The bread basket fare was very mundane--nothing special such as Noble bread.  Now, I love bread and the minute I land in Paris I go straight for a bakery to get some bread. So if there was any redeeming quality in these breads, I would have found it and I did not. 
The caesar salads were ok minus the grated cheese which took the form of little rods (such as the cheese you find in supermarket pre-shredded cheese bags).  Freshly grated parmesan cheese would have given this salad more of a steakhouse feel.  The dressing had a rich taste to it--nice and garlicky. 

We ordered two Delmonico steaks.  One BLUE, meaning totally rare and cool in the middle and one medium rare.  Server said she totally understood the BLUE part of the order because she repeated: \"Yes, cool in the middle\".  When we got the steaks, the BLUE one was closer to medium-rare and the medium-rare was closer to medium and at the ends it was well done.  My dining companion did not want to complain about the over-doneness  of his steak for fear that it would take another 30 minutes to re-fire the steak.  He chose to eat from the middle of the steak what he could with the mashed potatoes which were quite good.  The rest of the steak stayed on the plate--no point in taking it home. 
 
During the meal we tried to sprinkle the food with black pepper but quickly found that the pepper-mill was broken.  A server was nice enough to swap it out for a working one.  As I attempted to sprinkle the mashed potatoes with the Himalayan Pink salt (I love this salt!), I found that salt-mill was also broken.  
The butter cake dessert was overly sweet but I was able to eat the gelato on top of it which was just sweet enough.  
The service was polite and friendly.  On one occasion I had to drink my husband's water because mine was gone and nobody noticed.  

I don't know if we caught them on a bad night, but being that this is my first time at Preston's I really can't tell whether it's like this all the time or I just picked a bad night."}
{"text":"I had stopped in for happy hour. Had the Preston Burger. The most amazing Burger I have ever had. Half pound Burger cook to perfection topped with shaved prime rib onion straws Swiss cheese tossed bun and horseradish sauce on the side. The staff was friendly. The  bar area very classy. I will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I come here frequently because I live  round the corner, always greeted by the host.  Looks for a bar stool downstairs, but the place was packed and Electricity in the air.  Went upstairs and found my bartender, and saw Charles working both levels at full      capacity.   Had a great burger and a side of fried   did  special for me. Feeling Preston's has come a long ways, and service and food quality is job one!!!!

Still would like to get rid of of the .99 pricing !!!


Great happy hour
Great staff
Great upstairs view
Great food quality"}
{"text":"Been here for happy hour many times and a few dinners and always impressed at the food. The wait staff is a bit hit or miss however. Be sure to order the \"Prestons\" burger on happy hour for $10. It's yuge and comes with a top layer of prime rib, it's delicious! I don't feel like they try to nickel and dime you here like they would at a place like Mastros or Dominics. I always look forward to going back, keep up the great works guys!"}
{"text":"Had wonderful service.  Jill was our server and was delightful and offered great recommendations. The Pretzel Fondue was awesome appetizer. Highly recommend Prestons"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Prestons last night for date night.  Everything was fantastic!! I had the sea bass and my husband enjoyed the prime rib dinner - he shared a bit with me fortunately.  He had the artisan mac and cheese as a side which he deemed the best ever.  My asparagus was delicious. We found room to split the flourless chocolate cake- definitely a split but - wow! Our server was Lisa. I am sure everyone there is excellent but we felt well cared for.  We did not make a reservation and it was not a problem though I think we would do that for our next visit.  This was our first visit but will not be the last!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Friday night at 7pm after making an online reservation the previous day. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. We arrived and were seated immediately. It took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us but when she did she was very nice. The fresh bread also took an additional 10 minutes or so after our waitress came. We ordered the bacon wrapped bistro filet, 8oz delmonico, broccoli, and golden mashed potatoes. Overall the food was very appetizing and the steaks were cooked as ordered. The seasoning was enjoyable but I did find the filet to be more chewy than those I've had before. The sides were good as were our drinks. We did wait a significant amount of time again at the end when we were fully finished with all food and drinks to get our check, and the multiple episodes of prolonged waiting is why I'm taking off a star."}
{"text":"Our new favorite hangout. Everything about Preston's Steakhouse is worth mentioning. 

From the tastiest baby lamb chops AND the most delicious burger I've ever tasted ... at any price! The white sangria is a happy hour bargain and so refreshing during the hot summer months. Follow that up with some table side s'mores and you'll be coming back for more!

The ultra comfortable dining room seating is a pleasure to behold. Truly our favorite restaurant for dining comfort in all of Arizona. Once you are seated you'll never want to leave. Then add to the mix the delightful, welcoming personality of the General Manager, Lawrence Macias, and you feel as if you've made a friend for life.

We've previously traveled all the way into Phoenix for our steak fixes, but no longer. Now we can stay close to home while enjoying the best food in town being served up daily.

Oh, and about that fabulous bread basket and the pretzel roll cheese fondue appetizer, true works of culinary perfection. What's not to love? We've been here already two nights this week and can't wait to return to try every single item on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's bday and they guys here made it a memorable one. The manager threw in a discount and a complimentary dessert. Awesome service and the steak itself was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"It's a must visit for Wednesday nights!! Half off all bottles of wine and a great meat and cheese board. My friend and I sampled our way through the menu and finished with their butter cake. We had never been before but will be back! Highly recommend you can tell they use quality ingredients. 

Oh and the upstairs patio is BEAUTIFUL"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars.  We come here often, especially for important days like our anniversary and valentines.  In my opinion they have the best food and HANDS DOWN the best service in the area.  We love to bring friends here and show them how a 5 star dining service should be."}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly on New Year's Eve and sat at the bar.  Friendly bartenders.  Pretzel app and mains were great.  We'll skip fries (anemic) and pick a different dessert next time (vanilla creme brulee this time), but all in all, a pleasant experience.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wonderful steakhouse in North Scottsdale. Service is the best, wonderful waiters, managers and bus boys........this place is a must for an amazing dining experience and top notch service!"}
{"text":"Went to Prestons for the first time last evening.  The restaurant was 80% empty.  Being an NYorker I like my restaurants noisy and busy but that's ok.  It took our waitress 15-18 minutes to come over, Some manager helped us out until she arrived. The wine list by the glass was OK but not overwhelming.  The wine full list was not much better.  I settled for a mid-range Pinot because the cabs were just not happening. I had the lamb rack but sent it back because it was rare and not as ordered, When it came back it was better. The 12-ounce filet was perfect as were the mushrooms.  The special Brussel sprouts were tasty but drastically undercooked and not edible.  The comped flourless chocolate cake was very cold and not ready to be eaten but fine the second day.  Will I go back, Maybe, their pricing is comparable to other steakhouses, the ambiance is about the same but lacks sophistication and they need to update the wine list. Other than that I had an enjoyable evening, not enough people for me.  Oh re-heating the filet and leftover lamb came out ok I threw out the Brussels, the left over warmer flourless chocolate cake was much better.  I was a bit upset by the fireworks at the at tables for birthdays I thought they were a bit dangerous.  Prestons is nice but not quite there where I would like it to be.  I prefer J&G, or a noisy place."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks and appetizers after an event last night and sat in the lounge area. The staff was all very accommodating and service was quick. We had the lamb fondue, which was absolutely amazing and perfectly cooked, shrimp cocktail and cheese plate. Great food, great wine selection, great atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Once again Preston's Steakhouse served the most delicious meal on 6/18/2016. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the appetizers, including the lamb chops were terrific. The sides were delicious and plentiful. Servers abounded with water, food, clearing, and friendly comments."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 18 year anniversary Saturday. The steak and shrimp was delicious and the swordfish was also very good. The food was on point but nothing wowed me. There are several high end steak restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. The atmosphere was warm and low lighting made it a little more private and romantic. Our server was informative but had no personality. He was also a bit slow. I can name several other steakhouses in Scottsdale whose customer service is much better but I would give Preston's another chance."}
{"text":"Great addition to North Scottsdale! Service was 5 star Plus!!! Food was 5 star Plus!! We throughly enjoyed our experience! We started with the large Caesar salad which was perfect for my husband and I to share. It was great and tasty! I ordered the 8oz crab legs, delicious and plenty of food! They cut them in half so you don't have to hassle getting the delicious sweet meat out! They come in a nice hot cast iron pot to keep them warm. My husband ordered the 40oz Prime Rib and loved it! We also ordered a loaded baked potato, delicious! My son ordered chicken fingers (not on the menu) but they have things for kids to eat, just ask. The Chef, came out to our table and talked to us, made us feel extra special. He saw my son eyeing every server that rounded the corner thinking his food was coming, so he had his delivered early. We even ordered dessert and tried the signature butter cake with ice cream, OMG DELICIOUS! Get it, definitely order it!!!! A Must Try!! My son ordered the chocolate chip cookie baked in a skillet with ice cream, delicious!!!!! My only suggestion would be cozy, intimate booths. They may have them and I didn't see them I think the place is two levels. Thank you again to the Chef for making our night and adding that personal touch! Really provided the \"wow factor\" and great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"We really like this neighborhood steakhouse. It has a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere with a great upstairs bar/dining area where you can sit outside and enjoy the sunset. They have live music sometines as well. 

They have wonderful happy hour specials and they do lots of special occasions so it's fun to see the celebrations. Their butter cake is my husband's favorite desert of anything anywhere. 

We recently went for his birthday and had delmonico steaks with a side of scallops. Wonderful. As sides we had chili Mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes. The potatoes were the best. They have a good wine selection. The lamb fondue is a favorite as well as deviled eggs. 

My only criticism is there bread isn't very good and when we got our leftover food to go, which was quite a bit, they either forgot my steak or mixed ours up with the other couple at our table. One of the risks of packing your food away from the table where you can't see it. We do say give this place a try, especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had to date. I ordered the lobster tails and sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions. The prices were great for the amount and quality of food received and the service was excellent. Very attentive and nice waiter!"}
{"text":"We went here for Thanksgiving and it was terrible.  It took almost 3 hours to eat!  The wait staff was short handed, and they were not prepared for the influx of people I don't think, even though we all made reservations.  Speaking of reservations, I called weeks before to make one, the guy said ok (although I know he didn't write it down) and when they called to confirm they had me down for a different time and amount of people.  When we got there, that night, I told them I was gluten free (and they have a gluten free menu, so you'd think they would know what to do).  But, I couldn't eat the sauces, most of the things on the Thanksgiving menu had to be modified and when they brought out my turkey, it was served with gluten gravy all over it!  I sent it back, then it came out again with no gravy but stuffing (gluten), so I sent it back again and this time it came out correctly.  It was a mess and I will never go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff.  A must try.  Generous portions.  Very good mixed drinks.  Good venue for special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn because I come here a lot because my girlfriend doesn't travel south of Frank Lloyd Wright, so we end up here almost once a week if she is in town.  Service is pretty good, almost everyone is very nice and professional.  The food is good, some dishes are better than others, but I am not sure I  would crave any of them.  It is a solid place and with good company, very enjoyable.  We have had the steak as well as seafood.  They also offer a pretty generous happy hour, which we rarely make since my girlfriend is always late, lol.  I am sure I will be back since she will be back it town at the end of the week."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service atmosphere and more. Have been there more than a few times and each time it gets better. Try the sauces with the Delmonico! Yummy. Will be back again and again. Also love the roof top deck and the best happy hour around."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. Stop here for happy hour and you won't regret it! A Friday night wouldn't be complete with out a couple drinks and a mixed grill or 2. Everyone here is super friendly and it creates such a good atmosphere. Make sure you get a homemade pepperoni stick of two to kick the dinner off right. The steak and all the food is always cooked to perfection. Definitely a spot I'd recommend."}
{"text":"This place is everything and more as advertised. Food was beyond excellent and service was even better. We loved both our waitress, Allison, and our bartender, Paul. Everyone working here was friendly, engaging and highly professional. We had dinner in the bar and had the coconut shrimp, the steak salad which was better than I ever dreamed it could be, chicken tacos which were described as awesome and for dessert I had the signature butter cake. Along with such great premium cocktails, it made quite an evening. I definitely will return. One last thing, if our GM does read this, give Allison and Paul a raise, they were beyond the best."}
{"text":"Great Place. Ambiance is stunning. Service was great. I ordered the Bone In Rib Eye and Lobster Mash.   Steak was very good and favorable. The Lobster Mash had huge chunks of Lobster.  Also order the Filet.  The Filet was awesome in taste. The First half of it was very good However the last part of it was tough... like chewing leather. I didn't experience that with the Rib-Eye but the server was nice enough to comp that and offered an excuse on what could have happened. This did not ruin the experience so Moving on I had the Butter Cake with Ice Cream for dessert.  I would go there just for that if I had too. So Please try that. I think  the meal  was priced just right and would suggest and recommend all to try it out."}
{"text":"Where do I start
Very very impressed The food is out of this world service is awesome The dessert was amazing.
Everything we ordered was delicious started off with a French onion soup calamari cheese platter and Lamb chops. You must try the lamb chops!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and enjoyed several things about this place.  The staff was very well trained and knowledgeable of their offerings.  Being our first time there, we asked a lot of questions and our server never had to say, \"Let me go find out.\"

The bar menu was extensive and happy hour goes from 4-6pm.  We started out with some pepperoni sticks and \"Pig Wings\".  The pepperoni sticks were really good and the pig wings had some of the most delicious & tender meat I've had.  The pig wings were small, short leg shanks that were cooked slowly.  Excellent.  

They only serve two soups and they are French Onion and New England Clam Chowder.  At 7pm on a Wednesday, they were out of the French Onion, so we had the Clam Chowder.  While the chowder was delicious, it is served in a tiny crock pot with a lid over a candle warmer.  The soup was luke warm.  When I asked about that, we were told the candle underneath would warm it up.  That didn't make sense.  They are supposed to cook it, not me.  When soup arrives at the table, it should be hot & ready. As for the salads, very nice.  I can't remember for sure, but I don't think they have a bleu cheese dressing which would be nice.

Entrees and sides: My steak Delmonico was fantastic.  The crab legs were precut and a generous portion.  The sides were pretty good, but the lobster mashed potatoes were lacking in flavor just a bit.  The au gratin potatoes were too heavy on the cream and too light on the cheese.  The asparagus were very skinny (about the thickness of a straw), but pretty tasty.

Overall, we are very impressed and will return.  To be hitting on as many cylinders as they are after only being opened a week or so was impressive.  There is no doubt this will be 5 Stars in my eyes very soon."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.   Reasonably priced.   The prime rib was good if you like it smoked.  The crab leg appetizer was great, the sauce was perfect.  The bone in rib eye was great too.  The French onion soup was bland.   Mushroom side had too many onions and the corn was too southwestern for a steakhouse and not to mention spicy.   Recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations as all of the reviews raved about this place. Our server was great & very helpful with everything but for the pricing I feel like the food just didn't live up to the hype. I had the filet with mashed potatoes & the mushroom sauce on the side, hubby had the filet with fries & chimichurri sauce. The bread that came before our meal was very over toasted & the texture almost reminded me of gluten free bread. As for the meal it was cooked fine but nothing really made us fall in love. The mushroom sauce was a bit tart which threw me off & the fries weren't very crispy. The mashed potatoes were good but for the price we paid I just can't justify it. They came to box up our leftovers & I made sure to tell them to include the large amount of fries left (as my toddler would've loved it) but when we got home the only thing in the to-go box was the leftover bread. That was really disappointing, honest mistake but still a bummer. Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but as wonderful as the ambiance was, I just don't think we will be rushing back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Scottsdale. Love it. Regular menu is great too. Great steaks and fish. Service always great. Wonderful ambiance"}
{"text":"This is the best place to come for happy hour. The staff the bar tenders and the servers are amazing.    Their happy hour menu is very affordable and incredible menu.  I recommend this over Mastros."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner there last week
Steak was wonderful, I have to say we did NOT enjoy the lyonnaise potatoes but the steak and the creamed corn was amazing. 
The apps were nice. We had coconut shrimp which was good very hot (temperature)
It's pricey and they tout having great desserts. My husband had the key lime pie and truly said it was the best he's ever had. I had the butter cake it was not great just ok. 

The service was slow but proficient 

We made a reservation via open table which is always nice. 

We would definitely go back but it's expensive and in Scottsdale we have some amazing steak restaurants. It's not the best but it's far from the worse."}
{"text":"Today we came for cocktail hour.   Arriving at five http://www.crystalcruises.com/is a mistake.  So are the oysters.  Server Andie  seemed annoyed and said I don't have time for this question I'm busy.  Which is true very busy indeed.  Deviled eggs and ice tea good. Traffic flow poorly designed .    Conclusion.  Avoid happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars! It's not only the food, the service... But all the concept & people behind it to make it a wonderful experience. I was there today with 3 friends, and we all appreciated the happy hour menu-- which is like no other. You get full-size items, and a generous selection. They're proud of their Happy Hour. I have noticed more and more restaurants not even telling you is currently having Happy Hour. I usually tend to learn about it later. Or after the check :/ But at Preston's they don't only tell you is HH but the waitress will patiently explain it to you. There's actually a few things I was impressed with, and I usually do not like bullet points, but I feel I need them, so here it goes:

-There's always an assigned, separate server set up to fill your cup of water, so you never run out of water, or even have to ask for it... Yes!!
-They have a sample of their signature cake in abundance on a side table for anyone to try... Who does that?
-The manager, or at least seemed like it, is personally involved in making it a better experience. Some other places the manager asks you, how you're doing, and moves on... But here he's hands on.
-The ambiance is always on point. 
- Our table got a courtesy cake a la mode for being a firs-time diner... Whaaat?
I cannot say enough of them. I appreciate the service and food and would definitely be back... For Happy hour off course!"}
{"text":"First visit, but very impressed! Great service, great food. Super pricing at Happy Hour.
We sat in the bar, but did not sample the normal menu. The Happy hour menu was very complete and quite affordable...but you have to get there before 7pm!
Killer Cheese burger sliders & my wife loved her Crab Cake sliders also.
The signature Butter cake very very good, but was hard to decide which desert to order as all sounded great. We will have to go back again!"}
{"text":"We dined last night 6/5/2015. This was a choice made by a very gracious post card invite to come in and enjoy a two for one offer on their Delmonico steak. You can use this offer on either a 10oz or 14oz which is very generous. Our server Elias was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu. I might add that at no point did our service lighten up as we had let him know that we would be using this offer as so many times can happen when using promotional offers. Thank you Elias for the professional service! 
As for the previous reviews regarding high pricing, I think not!!! The prices are right in line for a high end steakhouse and we found the salads and the sides to be well under some local competitors. 
As for the food, we started with the lamb chop and fondue appetizer. Chops were cooked perfectly. The fondue was good but needed seasoning. We then shared the large Caesar salad, perfect portion for two to share as a starter. Steaks were cooked perfectly and were so tender, very impressed since this cut is the center cut sirloin. Great seasoning as well. We also splurged and shared the twice baked lobster potato and there was honestly lobster in every bite and not at all overpriced at $19.99 considering similar dishes elsewhere are well over $30.00. We also didn't find the 2011 Kenwood \"Jack London\" cabernet overpriced at $50.00. Great bottle and we loved it.
There are really only a few things I found a little off and it may just be a matter of personal taste. However, we both thought the dishware that the salads came in looked and had the feeling of cheap Corelle. Sorry! Also the butter with bread service being unsalted wasn't appealing. Lastly, the ambiance was nice but the chatter of guests was the prominent sound in the room. Although I don't like extremely loud music in the dining room it felt like a bit more volume from the piped in overhead music was needed. 
Overall it was a great dinner and I'll come back as well as recommend it to friends. Thank you again for the generous invite. Nice Touch!"}
{"text":"It is with deep sadness that I am writing this review and rating this restaurant with only one star. I was out with my wife, sister in law and mother in law...our fifth visit to this restaurant in a year. I am going to list the series of events that happened this evening including poor service and food in hopes that management will work to improve the experience for their guests.

1. The hostess wanted to seat us next to the entrance/exit to the kitchen when there were clearly better tables available. When I selected the a table I received a negative attitude from her. Why as a hostess you feel empowered enough to act like that is beyond me. Your only responsibility is to be NICE to guests. Your job is very important because you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

2. After receiving water and cocktails we waited over 15 minutes to receive the bread. Tables that were sat after us received their bread inside 5 minutes, why were we ignored?

3. Salad was average at best, took forever to be delivered. Why?

4. My steak was undercooked, waitress was not present when food was delivered to ask if it was cooked properly. Again, why?

5. Twice baked potato was delivered to our table on its side, again why?

6. Ordered another cocktail for the mother in law, there was a bug in the ice. Waitress agreed it was a bug but took 10 minutes to return to the table with a replacement. Why did it take so long?

7. I have now reached my boiling point, I excuse myself from the table to find the manger because all of our water glasses are empty. I tell him that we live down the street, we are so happy that Preston's is here because of how much we love Arrowhead Grill. Explain to him (gently) about the challenges thus far, he apologizes and fills our water glasses. 

8. They bring us free butter cake, thank you for that but trying not to eat sweets. 

9. Catch some attitude from the bus boy and server about boxing up our food, why?

10. Bill comes out with no comps except for the cake. Seriously, everyone felt uncomfortable, in fact my mother in law says she has had no fun. To be clear she is the most easy going person on the planet.

11. I can't believe I am writing this but it pretty much sums up the night. Takes ten minutes to get the bill and when I go to sign it, the pen doesn't work.

There are a multitude of steak houses within 15 minutes of this restaurant. Please, please, please figure it out. North Scottsdale is not the place to provide this type of dining experience. I gave the manager every chance to make things right and his only solution was a comped desert. 

Please read my other reviews as I do not use Yelp as a tool to bash on restaurants. I give more great reviews than bad. THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Both my filet and that of my girlfriends were not tender but tough and over cooked.  Wine was way, way overpriced, $22 bottle of 2012 Justin Cabernet was almost $80!  Typical restaurant markup on wine is 2 to 2.5 times not almost 4 times!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and frankly were surprised that this (and another steakhouse soon) moved into the neighborhood. We had two good steakhouses now three and soon there will be a 4th in the neighborhood? In any case Preston's is the closest to our home so we thought we'd give it a try. With 3 competitors you have to be hitting on all cylinders and we enjoy the competing establishments once a month or so.

A few annoying things before I even start on the food. We checked the menu out before we went online and frankly laughed that the price of everything here ends in .99 Really do you think that will fool us into thinking it costs a dollar less? PLEASE just say $10 and not $9.99 ok? You are not fooling anyone. There's no happy hour menu online and its a shame because when we showed up it was still happy hour and we found the selections were ok A huge annoyance was the bizarre happy hour menu with no prices on it. Really? All the menu say is this item $5 off and this item $1 off (suddenly they are taking off in whole dollars) In any case you need to look at the discount and then find the item on the regular menu and then figure out what its going to cost. Hey I am here for happy hour I really don't want to bring my accountant along. So why not just put the happy hour price on the menu? It won't cost you any more ink and I am here to relax after dealing with research and numbers all day. Lastly, I appreciate good service which in my mind is like they are not there. We felt that the bus and wait staff were hovering. Don't ask me \"is everything still amazing\" (multiple times). Come by and ask everything ok here or can I get you anything?  I don't blame the wait staff we know someone (who is clueless) is telling you all to do that. We were going to stay with the program and leave a 19.99 % tip but decided the math was too hard without a calculator so we rounded up. When we left the staff  (4 of them) were all at the hostess stand (no customers) and no one opened the door for us or even said good night or thanks for coming in. Nice last impression. Have any of you ever worked fine dining?  

Finally the food: As I said we were here for happy hour and so were going to have a few glasses of wine and a few items to see what we could expect for dinner. We started with the complimentary sausage sticks. Nice touch (thank you) and pretty good too. They may have been the best thing we had here. We each had a Preston\"s burger (a burger with sliced smoked prime rib on it) It seemed like a great deal at $9 (ok $8.99 normally $15.99) I am on low carb so I wanted something other than $6.9999 potatoes (which you have to order from the regular menu) to go along with it. So I had a small caesar salad for $7.99 also from the regular menu. The burger was OK doubt it was 8oz (because I had it rare so I don't think even prime meat would lose that much volume when cooked to rare) It came medium rare which I can handle The smoked rib on it was pretty good more well done than rare but I attribute that to the smoking time and it tasted good never less. The bun on the burger was a step above wonder bread and made it easy to be good and stay on the low carb thing. Why not use a Kaiser bun, sourdough or brioche on your namesake burger? Have you tried the burger down the street? The salad was disappointing. The dressing was not like any caesar I have had or made. The egg, dijon and oil should give a real caesar a creamy quality. This was more of a vinaigrette and a sin for such a poor version in a steakhouse.  Caesar dressing is so easy to make, it does not make sense.

One last thing we were going to have wine with our happy hour and we found the list shallow in the wines we enjoy and way overpriced. Too bad we are wine lovers with a large cellar home. We enjoy our wines but will not pay the bottle price for one glass of wine. I understand the desire of restaurant to make 5x wine mark-ups (Preston's does better on the higher end wines ($13.9999 a glass+ ) but I really don't see the 2 of us having 4 or 5 glasses of 2 different wines and spending $85 for what would be a $17-18 bottle of wine. We cut our evening short and had 2 dark beers. I can't recall the brand but they were good ($1 off off, let me look it up on the regular dinner menu...$5.99 ) and after we got home we opened up a bottle of wine and enjoyed the patio view (and no one asked if it was still amazing).

So all in we have to say is Meh... We decided to skip any future dinner plans at Preston's For now we feel it was not on par with the competition."}
{"text":"We've visited Preston's quite a few time since our last review and the food and service has been very consistent. Can't say the same about Mothers Day as the staff seemed overwhelmed and food was not quite up to previous standards. Hoping this was an anomaly as the experience did not match the price."}
{"text":"Pulling off a perfect Thanksgiving meal is like doing  a Whitney song for karaoke. You better be GOOD and Preston's didn't disappoint on anything! 

The portions were more than enough to take home for your \"leftovers\" everyone wants and they nailed the balance of dressing, cranberries and sides o'plentiful. 

If I had one suggestion it would be add a pie to the dessert menu. Everyone loves pie on Thanksgiving. 

Great job Prestons!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this restaurant. I cannot say enough about the service and friendly staff. We were well cared for and enjoyed chatting with our servers and GM. 
Our steaks were excellent! We had the Delmonico and the beef was outstanding and prepared perfectly. 
Caesar salad was good but not special, baked potato was delish. 
Our drinks were very good. I had a Peartini -yum!
The Happy Hour looks amazing. 
We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight. It's restaurant week and we sat at the bar so it was happy hour too. $1 oysters on the half shell. Bacon wrapped filet. Great food and both bartenders were so friendly. Fancy steakhouse with a neighborhood restaurant feel. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, ok service, just don't order a martini! The bartenders try to trick you by saying they'll leave a little in the shaker but the reality is it is only half a glass!

So I just tried Prestons again. We sat down at the bar and the two people next to us closed out and got up and left. The bartender cleared their dishes and then slid their place setting over to our area without first wiping down the bar. We got up and left. This place is hopeless."}
{"text":"We celebrated the end of my 8 week daily cancer radiation and Valentine's Day a bit early (the Friday eve before) here as my neighbor had a 2fer Delmonico steak coupon.

She is a beef snob and said her steak didn't have much flavor BUT she also asked for her meal NOT to have any salt added

I was happy with the steak, served sizzling - CAUTION - you will get spattered it you get your clothing too close to the plate when it is served

We each had a glass of wine and split both the large dinner salad and the twice baked potato. Both were split before they arrived at the table. PLENTY of food even after the split

As my neighbor told our waitress what the occasion was they went above and beyond and brought a \"Congratulations\" desert with a candle, very unexpected and appreciated even though we were both stuffed."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food cocktails happy hour, all wonderful. We'll be back.
Prices and menu very similar to their other restaurant, Arrowhead Grill in Glendale AZ.
We sampled several appetizers, crab cakes, burger, Mac n cheese. All perfect."}
{"text":"The ambience, the steaks, and the service are all 5 STAR!!! Don't miss this place! Buttery steaks, fresh vegetables, great staff, and the best drinks in North Scottsdale. We were treated like royalty:)"}
{"text":"Came to Preston's for my last dinner of a work trip and it was some delicious food!

I got the steak filet cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare, with sauteed spinach and lobster mashed potatoes. The spinach was great, and the lobster mashed potatoes were outstanding. There must have been an entire lobster in the dish and was enough for the table to share. High quality food for a very fair price point.

I really enjoyed this place and will go back my next trip out to the west."}
{"text":"You cant get any better than this!!!  Happy our is incredible.  The food is the best!!  Try the prime rib ( end cut)  just don't take mine!!"}
{"text":"We have patronized Preston's many times as a couple and with friends and always enjoyed dining in the main dining room and happy hour in the bar.  This past weekend we hosted a graduation party for 20 and it was fantastic.  Ashley was so helpful in putting the party together; seeking input for whatever we wanted to make it just right.  As always, the food was great and the service was impeccable to make the night just right.  We were never rushed and the room was made available to us for the entire evening.  Many of our guests have called to say what a wonderful place it was to have an outstanding dinner. To the management and staff - a big thank you."}
{"text":"As always excellent protein. The filet was prepared to perfection. 
However, the Caesar Salad was very disappointing. The dressing was tasteless and it looked like one of those side salads that are served along with entrees to appease customers. That's not good enough when one is paying $9 for a half salad. 
Service was a mixed bag. The hostess acquitted herself well but the server lacked the warmth and welcoming demeanor that is expected at an establishment like this. The evening before I had dined at J&G at the Phonecian and was blown away by energy and friendliness of the wait staff."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Arizona! We love it here, especially the happy hour in the bar area, the prices are great for the quality and quantity. The staff is awesome and very attentive. Kudos to management, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant. We are very picky and their service and food is extraordinary. Staff are friendly and listen and if anything isnt just perfect they more than make up for it. They want you back! and that's the attitude to have. Great food."}
{"text":"Very nice experience, made better by Aimee, our server. Food was delicious (yum lamb chop appetizer), perfectly cooked steak. Atmosphere elegant but not pretentious. We will definitely come back if we visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"4th time at Preston's in 2 years and won't return.  Need to wait until I'm 55+. Service was great!!!! Apps were mediocre at best.  Rather go to Mastro's."}
{"text":"This place started out with good bread but a small dab of butter for 4 adults for real! Not impressed with the service or food. We went for an anniversary celebration but the steaks that evening weren't up to par with my sons last visit. I did not like the Brussel sprouts side dish."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour menu.  The pepperoni sticks alone are worth coming here.  The portions are good and the food is cooked just right.  They have an upstairs patio that has a great view but it's outside so best visited on a pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Decided to Prestons  last night. Second day open to general public. I have to say that this restaurant has the potential to be a fabulous destination. Steaks were fantastic and prepared perfectly. Wine list fairly priced. Will be back give it a shot you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Preston's really delivered an excellent meal for our party of 6.  The atmosphere here is clean  and sophisticated, yet relaxed and comfortable.  We were greeted quickly and offered beverage service immediately,  which is the kind of attention to detail that made this a superior dinner.  The menu has a good offering of items other than steak.  I chose a chop salad which was perfect and delicious; I ate all of it which is rare for me and salad.  Then came
Lyonnaise potatoes and Tuscan Steak.  This steak was the best tasting steak I have enjoyed in years.  Preston's gets my vote for the best in Scottsdale.  Service was prompt and courteous the entire time, and the desert menu is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We have been to Preston's about three times now. All three times have been wonderful especially last night. We decided to take our daughter to celebrate her 15th birthday. They really made it memorable for her. She enjoyed the food, and her birthday cake. If you haven't been here, we recommend it. If you are a steak lover, get the 22oz. Porter house, you will not regret.u"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best happy hour in North Scottsdale.   A huge selection at real happy hour pricing.  The atmosphere is upscale and comfortable. The staff and service is very attentive. So much to try!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go for Happy Hour!  Outdoor Patio is awesome!  Good food, and drink to share with friends!  All were happy!"}
{"text":"Always a great time. Excellent food and drinks. Atmosphere is perfect for the one night a year or the every other weekend. Service is the most friendly I've ever received. The meat. Aged to perfection and cooked even better."}
{"text":"Had the Preston's Burger during Happy Hour! Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Hello best happy hour ever! I'm the type of foodie who likes to ball on a budge and this place delivers. Preston's Steakhouse is perfect for high class, high quality eats at cheap prices if you go between the hours of 3-7pm.

I went with my family and we collectively ordered the Preston Burger, steak salad, green bean fries, and lamb chops with fondue. Words cannot begin to describe how delicious everything was and each entree was under $20. The best dish was definitely the lamb chops with fondue. I've never had such tender lamb chops. The burger was delicious too. Only $10 and was a huge portion with a generous amount of meat. The fondue was a generous portion as well so we had extra left to dip the burger in. I'm a glutton and did not leave a single piece of food left. There's no shame in how much I love this food. 

As a side note, I know the dinner prices are pretty steep so for now I'll stick to the happy hour and keep returning whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Preston's for the very first time last week and I have to say we were not only underwhelmed but extremely disappointed.  First, let me say the atmosphere at Preston's is elegant and prices compared to that of Eddie V's.  That's where the similarities ended.  I ordered Chilean Sea Bass and my husband ordered the filet.  He said his filet was pretty good.  However...the Chilean sea bass I received not only had a strong fishy taste but also smelled like ammonia which meant the fish was bad.  I was very congested from a head cold I caught and even then I was able to smell the ammonia coming from this fish! I ended up returning the fish and ordered wild salmon instead.  Even though we're particular our food, I've NEVER send food back to the kitchen unless something is terribly wrong.  

My husband ended up finishing his filet by the time I received my salmon which was also very underwhelming. So...I ended up eating dinner by myself after my husband already finished his steak. Let's just say I probably could have made it myself and had a better tasting salmon.  I understand that things happen in the restaurant business.  However, to not offer to even comp my portion of the meal or even a dessert (which we didn't order because I had completely lost my appetite by the this time).  I have to say not only will we never return to Preston's but I've also told many of my friends and coworkers since to avoid this place.  It's really too bad that the meal couldn't have been a better experience."}
{"text":"My filet was melt in your mouth delicious! I am from Texas and this was the best steak of my life! Loved celebrating our anniversary! Thanks Landon!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in az , amazing service , food choices and overall dining experience . We frequent mastros, steak 44 a lot but I must say the quality and taste here if the steak is by far the best"}
{"text":"We are here today and had an amazing meal! Robert was a great server, very attentive! The twice baked potato is by far the best!"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and really had a great experience! The service was top notch. I sat at the bar. The menu was varied and the pricing was excellent for such a nice setting and atmosphere. Decor is upscale...I could see coming here for a nice dinner. 
 I had \"pig wings\" which aren't exactly wings per se, but they were delicious. I'll be back really soon and this time, I'm bringing more friends!"}
{"text":"Based on all of the great reviews, a friend and I went to Preston's happy hour and it did not disappoint!   The server (Christopher?) was awesome, the food was great ( we had the pork wings and the prime rib sandwich) and the happy hour prices were quit reasonable.  A great find!  We'll be back for another happy hour and want to try them for dinner."}
{"text":"Preston's is a very nice high end steakhouse. Our server was good, they made a mean mule, and my steak was an amazing cut cooked just right. I would give them 3.5 stars to make up for that but because I don't see those really inventive and delicious menu items that would make me want to come back. I thoroughly enjoyed their creamed spinach and roasted brussels sprouts, but these aren't the kind of items that I couldn't and haven't made on my own with similar results. Their key lime pie was also just so-so, I had a much better version for half the price at another restaurant a couple days earlier. They didn't make a graham cracker crust, and they drowned it in so much raspberry sauce that it overwhelmed the rest of the dish. The caesar salad was also just fine. 

Three simply because it is like every other steakhouse, but tip toward a four for well executed food and good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from Chicago and had dinner at Preston's. What a fantastic dinner! Our waiter was very friendly and helped us pick out a bottle of wine. We ordered the bone in ribeye and 12 oz by strip as entrees and crab legs as an add on. It was delicious. Steaks cooked perfectly with great flavor. The crab legs were meaty and perfect! As sides we had the brussel sprouts special and au gratin potatoes. Both were delicious. Finished the meal with butter cake and couldn't have asked for a better date meal. Total for all of this and $50 bottle of wine was $200. So on par with other steak house dinners."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was an excellent find. The ambience is very nice, the food was delicious and our server, Lisa, could not have been more attentive. We all had the Delmonico steak and agreed they were cooked to perfection and  very tender. All of the sides we had were delicious as well. For dessert we four shared the house specialty, a butter cake. Very moist and delicious. We will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Food wasnt so great but the service was phenomenal so I will return to try again. The Chilean seabass was extremely fishy. A lot of iceberg salads on menu :( wasnt impressed with the lobster mash potatoes either. The cook came out to apologize and made us something else. Staff was great. The environment is beautiful and I even got a tour of the place and kitchen. It was a great experience. I will return and hope for an improvement of the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and wanted to try something new.  Hubby had stopped in for their happy hour a few times, and really enjoyed that experience, so we opted to celebrate here. 

There were so many positives, I'm not sure where to begin.  Our server, Lisa was a delight.  She was positive, knowledgeable and really in tune as when to appear and when to give us time and space to savor our meal. 

Hubby loves his fresh-baked bread, so enjoyed noshing over cocktails and reviewing the menu.  I have a shell-fish allergy, so sadly that limited my options for an appetizer, so we \"settled\" for the lamb fondue.  OMG - I'm not kidding that it was the best thing ever.  The lamb lollipops were served with a subtle, warm goat cheese fondue.  The whole thing melted in your mouth.  I could have ordered a second one and made a meal out of it.  Seriously good stuff.  

We opted for salads - I tried the chopped and hubby had the Caesar. Both really good - light dressings that were flavorful.  Perfect size. 

Now - the entrees - we literally could not decide, so both opted for the smoked prime rib.  They were served on sizzling hot plates and were cooked perfectly. Note: I really appreciate their detailed descriptions on what rare, medium-rare, etc. looks like. Nailed it.   So, the prime rib was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  So tender and tasty.  Heaven.  And huge - much of it went home for breakfast. 

We ordered the French fry trio - waffle-cut, shoestring and sweet potato with yummy sauces.  The broccoli w/ cheese was actually a little too cheesy for us, so next time, we'll just get the steamed broccoli.  

Now - just when we thought it couldn't get better, for our anniversary they brought out a butter cake ala mode with a giant sparkler.  Beautiful.  And the best butter cake I have ever tasted.  We cleaned the plate.  Wow 

General manager Charles stopped by several times - it was a delight to meet him, and we could tell his commitment to providing a memorable experience for his guests.  Great teamwork by the entire staff. 

We will be back - and we absolutely must try their rack of lamb.  And we won't wait for our next anniversary!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Squared. Maybe cubed. 
Odd location but don't let that dissuade you. Five stars on food and service. Ambience is a little lacking but the other two make up for it. Great steakhouse.  Been here three times and had perfect experience all three times. I'm sold."}
{"text":"We've always been huge fans of Preston's sister restaurant, Arrowhead Grill. Unfortunately, since they were booked up for New Year's Eve, we decided to head over to Scottsdale and give Preston's a try. We assumed that the experience would be equivalent.

If you're familiar with Arrowhead Grill, you'll find that the menu at Preston's Steakhouse is very similar in terms of what they offer. Many of the entrees and sides are identical, including a few unique additions, such as their red velvet variation on AG's signature butter cake.

I was initially surprised that Preston's only has a 3.5 star average, with most people citing poor customer service as their main issue. Unfortunately, it didn't take us very long to realize that these reviewers were spot-on.

I'll start with the good:

Our server was very friendly and the food itself was excellent. I wouldn't expect anything less. The Delmonico steak has always been one of my favorite cuts of meat, with superb artisan mac and cheese and Yukon gold mashed potatoes as great side additions. Although admittedly, I was a little disappointed that the far, far superior cheese and bacon infused mashed potatoes found on their AG menu were conspicuously absent.  

I also saw many parties ordering their amazing butter cake for dessert. Although we didn't order the original version at this location, I can assure you that it's, without a doubt, something that everyone must try at least once.

Now, for the bad:

Preston's is in a much larger space than AG, which includes multiple rooms, fireplaces, and a second floor patio. When crowded, the place can get extremely loud and could desperately use some type of sound paneling treatment. We could barely have a conversation. The place just seemed way too noisy and frantic for a fine-dining atmosphere, which we've never found to be an issue at Arrowhead.

What's up with serving sodas in miniature aluminum bottles in an upscale restaurant? It's a cheap tactic that allows them to get away with charging for refills - and the soda only fills 3/4 of the glass! You want more? Then you'll get double-charged! Seriously?

When we were seated at our table, my girlfriend thought something was odd about her chair. It wasn't until 15 minutes had passed that a bus boy did a double-take, mumbling something to her, while then reaching behind her back and dramatically yanking out a giant server tray that was somehow lodged between her back and the chair's backrest. It's as if he were performing some type of magic trick. Why was there a tray lodged in her chair? No idea. But the bus boy deserves credit for noticing something that everyone else (including us) failed to catch. 

The complimentary basket of bread that is always served BEFORE the meal took forever to come out. In fact, after 40 minutes, we had to flag down our server and request the bread. It was finally delivered to us, while our food was brought out literally seconds after. That's not the way it's supposed to be done. 

We decided to try their red velvet variation of their classic butter cake, as we knew it's unlikely that we'd ever return to this location again. It ended up tasting like regular red velvet cake, as the velvet completely overtakes the buttery flavoring that makes the original so great. My advice: stick to the regular one. I can at least confidently vouch for it!

While the food here is very good, I agree with other reviews who say they lack in customer service. The place just seemed very disorganized and lacking in efficiency, which probably isn't going to go over well with the clientele in this area.  

We'll always love Arrowhead Grill for their food quality and excellent customer service, but Preston's has way too many issues to warrant a repeat visit.

Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Delmonico steak. Drop the mic... this place is ridiculously good. We tried the 14 oz steak alone with the special (secret) house herbs and the version with the Louisiana shrimp (6 large!). Both were fantastic. The shared sides of broccoli with cheese, ham wrapped asparagus, & artisan mac n cheese were phenomenal! We thoroughly enjoyed our outdoor seatings we had heaters and watched the sun set. After a bit the two brothers who make up the jazz band played. Incredible! Preston's bring in their own racks of meat and cut them on site. This is a sister restaurant to the one in Arrow Head! It is named after the owner's grandfather. We had a very special night. A special thanks to Daniel, our server and Charles, the GM. What a beautiful and delicious evening! Don't forget the lamb chop fondue appetizers!"}
{"text":"A true Scottsdale embarrassment. I wish I could take Thanksgiving back. Food would have been ok for an Outback Steakhouse. No table service-no plates bussed. No water filled. No wine list offered to us. Every time I asked the waitress for something she said let me get the manager for you.  \"sorry, we have a large party upstairs-things are never like this.\"  Guess what... that's not my problem- if you are understaffed for a major holiday, close your restaurant. I gave two stars because a bottle of wine was comped for us.

I wish I could go back, I would've paid double the check amount to have eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not sure what took us so long to give this place a shot, great food at a great price.  If you are tired of the overpriced steakhouses give Preston's a chance.  My goto is Happy Hour from 3-7pm DAILY, I only get two things when I go- Prestons Burger $9.99 are you outta your mind?  and the MIX Grill $23.99 a little pricey but you get about 4 oz filet, 2 prawns, 2 scallops, when we dine for two we share the burger and the mix grill and are stuffed.  By far the best food happy hour in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bread was AMAZING. Could not get enough of it. Also salad with salmon in it was very good. The service is a little slow here but always very nice. That hostess I think her name is Hayley who used to work there was our favorite! Love the cakes that you can grab on the way to the bathroom!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Preston's Steakhouse.  The happy hour is nice.  Truly, not much of a savings but the food is very good.  We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and it was delicious.  The atmosphere is fine.  We went again a few days later and were seated in the dining room.  We were early but we did have reservations.  We were seated immediately ordered a drink and started relaxing.  They sat a couple next to us that brought their two little children.  Normally I don't mind children but the younger of the two was VERY LOUD.  Preston's was kind enough to accommodate us and move us away from the screaming kids.  We did notice they tried not to place anyone else around that family.  My husband ordered the 12oz. fillet and I ordered the sea bass.  The food was great and cooked to perfection.  We will definitely return.  The wait staff was great!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for special occasions  The Tajima is the only steak to order and I promise it will ruin ALL other steak houses and cuts for you! The atmosphere is romantic and the service is beyond your average restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour Sept 27 and while there we were subjected to a birthday sparkler being placed on an adjacent patron's table. The sparkler looked like a road flare. After burning out the obnoxious odor lingered for at least 20 minutes and a second sparkler was delivered to a table in the main dining room. The odor continued until we left. Suggestion, either find a sparkler that does not have residual odor or stop offering this perk. Really irritating to other patrons as well as the person at the receiving table."}
{"text":"Met some girls here for a birthday celebration.  Service was good.  Ordered pepperoni sticks which use to be complimentary but are now being charged.  I ate two.  I  ordered a Caesar salad which was bland and wilted.  After I got home I was sick all night.  Not a good way to celebrate."}
{"text":"It's really good but not 5 starts \"the best\" for a steak restaurant, there are a few other places nearby that have better steaks if that's what you're looking for. The Preston's burger is amazing, that's what I go here for! Also there are these Pig wings on the menu for appetizers and they are great! Cocktails and happy hour menu are good for a higher end steak restaurant so I do like that. Overall great place to eat, good food, good drinks, but if I'm looking to spend $50+ on a steak I'm going across the street"}
{"text":"Preston's is a great place to go to.  The service is second to none, great background music, great food, and the service is right on.  My wife and I went for Happy Hour and the menu is very extensive.  The food was great. 
    Steve the general manager is right there along with his staff to see that everything is running smoothly. He does a great job.  
     I know one thing for certain, we will definitely be back.

{"text":"Excellent service, highest quality steaks, gracious servers, great bar, attentive management. What more could you ask!"}
{"text":"We like their Happy Hour!  Lots of good stuff not he menu during Happy Hour and we ordered most of it.  Great price and great food!  Devils Egg is one of our favorite.  Will go there again!"}
{"text":"Prestons is a great place to dine.
They start off with a nice bread/butter. We sometimes get the cheese sauce to dunk with a pretzel roll. On happy hour menu. 
The happy hour is a vast selection of really good food. We love the Preston burger topped with prime rib. Decedent !
My friends got  for happy hour shepherds pie, which was great and deviled  eggs are a must, prime rib sandwich is really good.
They have a nice selection of wine, steaks and seafood. 
The atmosphere is very nice and upscale, but casual dress is OK.
Get there early if you want to imbibe in the happy hour. They do have a second floor with a small patio to eat.
This is a great place and the service is really good.
we are regulars here."}
{"text":"This was one of the greatest experiences I've had at an upscale steakhouse. We ate in the bar and enjoyed their many apps. The butter cake is to die for!!!  Great name. Better food!"}
{"text":"Food it's OK staff is strange....,,they all lack personality. Somethings just not right with this place"}
{"text":"Been dying to try Prestons. The best way is happy hour! Amazing service. The food (that I've tried so far) is off the charts. Blows Mastros away!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with some Canadian friends and we all agreed we had some of the BEST STEAKS we had ever had.  We didn't have any sides, just salads.  The salads were on the small side, but excellent.  Who wants to fill up on salad anyway.  Would I go here for seafood?    No, it's a steakhouse.

We've also been to Preston's for happy hour.  Start there and you will want to come back like we did."}
{"text":"Last night I dined at Preston's for the first time to celebrate my husbands birthday. He started with the shrimp cocktail, which were good. The issue is that the shrimps should be served on a bed of ice to remain cold, the last one eaten was at room temperature. I had the wedge salad, it was barely worth eating. The piece  of lettuce was huge, but out of whack with the other items, it needed less lettuce and more dressing, cheese, tomatoes and onion. We both had the 14oz Delmonico steaks medium rare. I thought mine was cooked as ordered and tasted pretty good, but his was just a touch overcooked. At the end of dinner the server acknowledged the birthday and brought over a warm butter cake without having to be asked. I thought this was a nice touch, that was until I got the bill and there was a $10 charge for it. I brought the issue to the server and she said she would take care of it and I supplied my credit card trusting that the proper adjustments would be made. The server brings back my credit card receipt and of course the butter cake was not adjusted out. I was to tired to bring it up again and just decided to let it go. If you want to celebrate a special occasion go to Mastro's or Steak 44, those places never disappoints."}
{"text":"Overall great experience! Ordered takeout instead of dinning in and was pretty pleased with the service! They took a little long getting the food out to me but tge manager handled me very well and was super friendly! And boy the steak sliders are to die for! The fries are a good side to go with the steak or cheeseburger sliders and if you have room after that, try to eat one of the famous buttercakes! It is amazing melt in your mouth cake that is very warm and fluffy! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant did not have exceptional food.  I had a ribeye that was not very tasteful although it was cooked right \"rare\" it was not juicy at all.  The other guests at the table had a porterhouse, filet and prime rib.  They were not impressed either.  Our table was not in a god location facing a huge drape at the back of the restaurant .  The butter cake desert was good that was it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and exceptional taste.  Food is worth the price.. ..birthdays are welcomed and the management is very attentive...."}
{"text":"Went here with extended family on New Year's Eve, and frankly, Preston's left a good amount to be desired for an upscale steak restaurant. 
Generally no complaints about the service, even with a large party our server was helpful and professional, there were just little touches that made things feel a little 'off.' For instance, the tables turned out to be those light grey plastic \"outdoor\" tables with fold-out aluminum legs hidden under a long white tablecloth. They tried to courteously/discreetly clear crumbs off the table between courses with a small metal \"scraper\" (as nice restaurants often do), but just ended up smearing sauce all over and leaving a line of debris in in front of my brother. Our family originally found out about the restaurant through promotional coupons in the mail, and they pushed the desert menu a little too aggressively at the end before asking everybody to join their email list.

The food was definitely hit-or-miss, I don't recommend the peppercorn sauce, and my fillet was heavily under cooked. The shrimp starter was also underwhelming, and the macaroni was very much average. My father's rack of lamb, however, was outstanding, as was the sheer size and diversity of the dessert menu, although we didn't order anything so I cannot speak on the quality.

Nothing was a total catastrophe, and nobody's meal was inedible, I'll just say that my whole family walked away knowing we wouldn't go back to Preston's again for a nice steak dinner; there are too many better options in the area for around the same price."}
{"text":"If you want a great meal with n a warm comfortable environment, then you must go to Preston's!
Also, why watch football games alone when Preston's has a wall of NFL games on Sunday!!"}
{"text":"6 colleagues and I dined at Preston's on a Saturday evening and it was phenomenal! We had a variety of steaks and market fish, the lobster mac, Brussel sprouts, and more. The service was lovely, extensive wine list, delicious pear martini, and more. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great new steakhouse in North Scottsdale in the old Michael's location (NWC, Pima Road & Pinnacle Peak).  I ordered a steak and some craft beer; both were excellent and the service was great.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated a friend's 40th birthday on the rooftop patio. Service was great. Food was great. Hope you open up patio every night next season. Awesome happy hour menu and sunset views!"}
{"text":"We want to like Preston's, but not impressed on many levels.  As Mastro's lite it has no vibe.  Service is spotty at best (ie) two busboys tried to remove our food long before we were finished.  Also, after ordering food our server disappeared (poof).  The mushroom and potato sides were an oil pit and small.  I guess that was a good thing.  I am not crazy about other steakhouse prices but  in the long run, they are are a bargain as you get  great entrees, sides and across the street a fun and not dreary experience."}
{"text":"Food is above average, Pricing is astronomical. New restaurant, new staff, lots of room for improvement for the $$$$ they are charging. Lost our reservation and ran out of bread. Difficult to find and if you go to far and take a left turn on Pima, there is no easy return.  Lots of reviews for happy hour, may try that next time, but a big No for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me just say right off the bat, I have never had a better piece of meat in my life!  My wife concurs.  I had the prime rib and my wife had the filet.  All other steakhouses I've been to pale in comparison.  It's a bit pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is yummy! It is expensive! For three people with multiple drinks and appetizers your bill will be over a $100. 
It is a happening spot and the food is worth the prices. The drinks are also very good. Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but avoid happy hour times. Our service for 8 was terrible and obviously they automatically charged 20 percent which gave our server no incentive to serve us. Also extremely noisy even though we were in the back"}
{"text":"I heard nothing but amazing things about Prestons; how great the happy hour was...only to be disappointed.

7 of us gathered for happy hour on the patio, a typical Arizona evening, perhaps a little bit too hot for a patio without umbrellas. We had a server come to take our drink order about 20 minutes after we sat down. My girlfriend asked for a cocktail recommendation, the infamous \" its all good\" came back from our server who looked like he was maybe 20 years old. She asked a more specific question of \"how is the red sangria verus the white?\" He replied, \"well, one we use red wine, the other we use white\" maybe he was only 19. Her final question \" are they sweet?\" Returned with \"yes, all of the cocktails are sweet\".  So she ordered a chardonnay. 

All of us ordered a drink with one couple ordering a bottle of wine. After the drinks were served, no bottle of wine. *On the plus side the 'bus boy' was amazing. He had been to and from the table about 5 times, refilling our water delivering bread, beads of sweat rolling down his face, I really wish this gentleman was our server because after another 15 minute a bottle was brought back and presented only to display the wrong bottle. We had difficulty convincing him that he brought the wrong bottle, we had to have him read the label, twice before \"my appologies\" and disappeared for another 15 minutes. So for the first hour of happy hour we had a drink and  4 glasses of water. Still missing the bottle. 

At this point is was almost humorous when he came back with the correct bottle but then couldn't find his wine key. The comical errors continued, because he was still sorry but couldn't seem to multi task but at least offering to take a second drink order to my parched friends, we like our happy hours. 

Finally the correct wine was poured, with his finger on the neck of the bottle, thinking this was more than a chain restaurant, I would have expected a bit more. I was kind of waiting to see him lick the bottle with the drop that ran down the side. It would have been a good show but he didn't.

Dinner orders, I'll stick for time with the first hour an a half of our first experience. But, the happy hour bar menu looked good, presented well but tasted boring and tired. My salad was soggy, the burgers we not cooked to order,etc.

We made a joke of the event and had a great time but next time we will probably do this at another establishment and certainly not for dinner.

Best of luck Prestons, let me know when the bus boy has been promoted to server and maybe we will come back."}
{"text":"When we saw the sign announcing their pending opening, we said another steakhouse? Across the street from maestros and with Flemings down the street, that market would seem pretty well covered in this neck of the woods.  But on the spur of the movement early last Friday evening, we decided to give them a try. 
We were quite surprised when we pulled in at 5:30 how full the parking lot was. When we walked in we were hit with a wall of noise. The bar was packed!! I asked the waiter during dinner and he said their happy hour menu was being quite well received and judging by the crowd, that would seem to be the case. 
As mentioned, we arrived quite early in the evening and there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables seated.  
I started with oysters and they were very good, fresh and taste of the sea. 
My wife and I each had their mixed greens salad.  I noticed that their salad wedge comes with Russian dressing or something, not blue cheese, how odd. I asked if they had blue cheese and the waiter said yes, so ordered my mixed greens with blue cheese. Well, it had a nice amount of blue cheese crumbles on it, but it wasn't blue cheese dressing. Not sure it was dressed with anything other than blue cheese crumbles. 
We each had the small filet with baked potatoes. Filets were very tasty and cooked exactly as ordered. 
Had a couple of glasses of a really nice cab with dinner, and when I mentioned how much I liked the cab, he informed us that they have a level 1 somm on staff. The somm stopped by the table a bit later and we chatted a bit. I will definitely avail myself of his services when we return. 
Despite the abundance of high end steak houses in the area, this place was completely packed by the time we left. I don't think there was an empty table. 
While I can't say it was extraordinary for this genre, it was fairly comparable to the rest. Would likely return."}
{"text":"On August 14th we ate at Prestons for the first and last time.
We ordered the Delmonico steak, which by definition is from the rib.

The steak was tough and tasteless. When we asked our waiter what cut of meat it was he told us it was top sirloin..a total fraud!  

We also had the Caesar salad...a mess of white romaine with no cheese, one tasteless anchovy-and stale croutons.  McDonalds has better salad than that!

The sautéed broccoli was totally tasteless...frozen at best!

No amount of coupons could ever convince me to return!!!"}
{"text":"Just curious, do they play music in the bar during happy hour?  We didn't hear any..."}
{"text":"Tried Preston's for the first time tonight, and as a loyal Mastro's diner I have to say that my Filet was cooked to perfection. I have never had a steak prepared as perfectly at Mastro's or Steak 44 so that right there gets five stars from me. To top off the perfect steak they have a very large selection of sides including multiple preparations of Mac and Cheese, potatoes and corn all of which at least matched if not bested Mastro's quality and definitely price. My sister and father shared the whole chicken which is carved table side, and I have to comment that the piece I tried was so tender and juicy I didn't need a knife to cut it. Being on the same corner as Mastro's I would choose Prestons's most of time going forward. Now not to make Phil feel bad I will still visit Mastro's for the butter cake and shrimp cocktail and the seasonal brunches, Prestons's is a great addition to North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Decided to have a small, nice anniversary dinner this evening however it was quickly noticed to us that our waitress was totally miserable and not personable. The only time we saw her was when she took our order and dropped our bill off. All the tables around us she would take time to talk to, laugh with, chat and what not. Brought food out, checked their drinks etc. Us though, nothing. We noticed that everyone else in the bar area around us had alcohol on their table but we didn't. We couldn't help but feel this also may have been why we got cold treatment as our waitress possibly thought our tab wouldn't be large enough to suit her liking. At any rate, the bus boy was the only one to bring our food, refill our drinks, take our dirty dishes away etc. When the waitress dropped the bill off she left the dirty plates on the table. Took forever to come back to collect my card, so I got tired of waiting after seeing her give other people their bill after me and taking it back for them before me. So I put my card away, threw the cash for the bill in the leather binder and got up and left. Before walking out, I walked through the restaurant to find my bus boy and told him this same thing followed by giving him what would've been the waitress' tip. After explaining to the bus boy I found out two things; 1) he even said he noticed the waitress was doing and being like all the things I mentioned above so that's why he tried talking more to us and being friendly and making chit chat and 2) he told us it was even his first night on the job. Pretty sad that such a high scale place like Preston's has a waitress on staff that treats certain people differently yet their busser treated us like he was the owner of the restaurant himself."}
{"text":"Went here with 4 couples for their happy hour. It is without a doubt, the best happy hour in town! Discounted drinks, bread service ( much better than most ), beautiful place, great service ( we had Jill who was awesome ), and especially the food selection. Large portions, not the skimpy ones you'll find elsewhere, plenty of seating, with particular mention of their behemoth Preston burger, an amazing creation. The roast beef sandwich came with au jus and French fries, all for an incredible $10.99. Be there before 6 and enjoy."}
{"text":"I went for Valentine's Day and had a great experience overall. I thought the quality of food exceeded more popular restaurants, such as Mastros. The artisan Mac and cheese is to die for. Just a few minor complaints... we were seated a decent distance from the kitchen but could still hear people talking and dishes dropping. They also forgot our shrimp that we ordered. It was Valentine's Day and they were very busy so we didn't bother mentioning it. I'm sure it would be an even better experience on an average night. The food was just so excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well, did Mothers day here a few week ago. Still not any better.

My previous review still stands, and to add:

* Steak was so seasoned it was almost un-edible. I think I drank about a gallon of water during dinner it was so bad.

* Service is VERY slow, deserts took about 20 minutes, and did bring out coffee again when then did arrive. Had to ask them.

Honestly, I would never return. In line with outback and the like level of quality. Cant believe I dropped $550 on dinner here."}
{"text":"Great service initially but read on...., tasty burger. Had one of their burgers which was good. The side of crispy green beans that the server suggested was nothing special and I told him I didn't care for them and he took it back and still charged me for them, which I thought was not really acceptable but I decided to keep my mouth shut and pay for them anyway. There are a lot of great side dishes in the menu and the crispy beans are definitely not one of them.

Call me silly, but due to the server's mistake and he clearly should have been aware of it considering how quiet the restaurant was at the time of my visit, I very likely will not give Preston's my repeat business regardless of how good their happy hour is!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! You have to try the butter cake for dessert!! Our server Lori was cheery friendly and gave us the best service. The sommelier was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"ANOTHER WANNA-BE?  Sorry, long review but needs more explanation to trust I speak the truth.  
10 star pricing & 3 star everything else!  First, I have 20+ years experience in the restaurants/banquets/catering industry (owner & non-owner) in Chicago & suburbs and I promise I know fine dining.  So, although a great menu, many, many fine touches missing that could of helped justify their pricing!  Lobster tail was under cooked & left in its shell - I lost my appetite right then & there.  To leave the shell on the plate as an accent.....no problem, it's a great prop,  but don't make me pull & play with it to get it out (and of course it takes more effort to get it out when it's not fully cooked) - as well the broccoli was barely warm & crunchy, cheese looked & tasted like Valvetta.  Drinks were short pours yet higher than most other finer dining establishments. Service was not close to par for extra fine dining pricing.  Desert & coffee were good.  Asked server if the beef was grass fed because that's what drew us there and she said \"usually but sometimes they can't get it so it's not\"!  That blew our minds.  On the one really positive note, the filet mignon was excellent, however still don't know if it was grass fed or not!  The staff wasn't so professional looking in spite of being in black uniforms - as well hostess didn't come across experienced or professional - not good as they are the 1st impression.   Please don't get me wrong they were very nice just didn't represent the classification.  I give them 2.5 years max unless they have some private silent investors willing to carry them because there's no way - I know the overhead and if this visit represents even 50% of their clientele, they will not have the necessary repeat customers to support it!  Sorry, I feel bad but it's the naked truth!  One last thing  - the manager came over to hand deliver our new broccoli and confirmed the chef was an agreement!  Although hot and not crunchy, cheesy, no pun intended.  Based on two different items being returned he should have comped the desert.  Bad bad bad! 
If they see this, contact me and I'll help it be a permanent fixture in Scottsdale ."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Happy Hour at Prestons Friday night with my husband and nephew, it was an energetic crowd all enjoying the wonderful food and drinks! Although the HH menu was diverse, priced well and extremely tasty, the mixologist/bartender Cacey stole the show producing the best martini I've had in my travels! I told him what I was looking for and he produced a magical flavor sensation like none other! If you want a good cocktail, nice bite and enjoyable environment, go here! Tell them Michelle sent you!! This will be our new Happy Hour spot!"}

It couldn't have been any better.  

BTW, Alice loved the firecracker:)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Great food, Happy Hour and friendly staff.  Relaxed atmosphere and superior service. They also have an amazing kids menu."}
{"text":"Here it goes, I'm going to say it -- Best Steak I've ever Eaten!  Wow, that took a lot especially since I have pretty high standards for steak, and generally feel I can cook one better at home than at most restaurants.  Even my husband, who for years has refused to eat steak at restaurants (even steakhouses) agreed - this was out of this world.

OK the details.  Came in and had a drink at the bar, very nice cocktails and atmosphere.  They have a great bar menu only available at the bar and some pretty decent happy hour specials.  You can also get the dining room menu at the bar but not vice versa.  My next visit I will probably stay in the bar to check out some of the interesting options they had.

Went to table and based off what we were seeing going out to other customers decided to split everything (huge portions).  Bonus points - not only did the staff not hesitate or blink when we asked to share, but where possible they actually split the portions for us in the kitchen.

Started with the calamari which came fired with some sort of a vinegar sauce, baby corn cobs and jalapenos.  It was fantastic!  Even though the sauce impacted the crispness of the batter it was totally worth it, and made the aioli unnecessary (although it was also delicious).  Next split the Preston's salad - arugula, dates, pears, goat cheese and candied walnuts - fantastic!  I could make a meal out of that salad alone.

For the entree we split the 22 oz porterhouse.  As earlier stated it was fantastic!  Finest quality meat - not too fatty, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Simple and elegant,  They do have several complimentary sauces you can add on the side, but we found then completely unnecessary.  For sides we chose the twice baked potato and sauteed spinach.  My only criticism would be that the spinach needed a little more seasoning like garlic, and a little less oil.

We were surprised with a complimentary butter cake since this was out first visit and although we were completely stuffed, found we couldn't stop eating this rich wonderful dessert.  The wine list is adequate, with several food choices at all price ranges.

It has been a long time since a restaurant in the Valley has impressed me but Preston's has hit the ball out of the park and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We don't go to steakhouses often, but this one was worth it! We went to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary and we are so happy to have gone here! First off, just for being first time guests, they offer you an appetizer or dessert on the house! Great touch! 
Loved the bread basket they bring, they have a variety of types in one basket so everyone can have something they like! 
My husband enjoyed his complimentary calamari and raves about it (I'm not a fan of calamari in general) and he doesn't like condiments or sauces but he loved the dipping sauce it came with! 
We both enjoyed our steaks, amazing flavor, both cooked perfectly and both so moist! 
The au gratin potatoes were so good! Different than I've had in the past but such great flavor! 
The artisan Mac and cheese left something to be desired but wasn't bad, just not as amazing as everything else!
Finally, they brought out a dessert for our anniversary topped with an enormous sparkler! So fun and exciting! The butter cake was DIVINE I may go back just for the butter cake alone! 
Preston's really made our anniversary dinner special and we were so impressed with the service, atmosphere and food! Loved every bit of it!"}
{"text":"We took our best friends to Preston's for their birthdays the other night.  Everything from start to finish was perfectly executed and the service was top notch.  I literally can think of nothing negative to say.  We started with the coconut shrimp and the lamb chop fondue along with very innovative cocktails and moved on to wedge salads and the house salads for the ladies.  Delmonico steaks served Oscar style was the main course selection across the table.  All four were ordered to different temps and all came out perfectly.  For dessert we had to have the butter cake which we always enjoyed at sister restaurant Arrowhead Grill and the flourless chocolate cake.  The butter cake is always a crowd pleaser, and the chocolate cake was good, but not the best I have had.  Overall the best steakhouse experience to date.  Even one of our companions who always seems to find a problem with every meal was completely speechless when we left.  Can't wait to go back for my birthday."}
{"text":"Very good steak house! Steaks seasoned very well, although a couple of our steaks were underdone it was fine in this case cause they served them on hot plates. Defiantly recommend the scallops potatoes as a side. Sssooo good, our server was very nice and gave us a great experience for our first time. Would go again!"}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience at Preston's.  We went there for Happy Hour.  We had a group of us, and decided to try several items on the menu.  Food was hot and tasty.  Service was excellent as well.  Will definitely come back and try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Tried Preston's for a quick bite last night. We ordered from the bar menu and decided on the bartenders suggestions of Pig Wings and Chicken Oysters both were good but the pig wings were very nice, pork shank is the wing and it was so tender the meat fell off the bone. It came with a ranch style dipping sauce (not remarkable). The chicken oysters were deep fried and came with french fries. This came with 3 sauces one being ketchup and the others were pretty nondescript other than tasting the same and one being exactly like what came with the pig wings. (I even stopped the waiter for an explanation of what they were but it made no difference). There were a couple of things that stood out, service not being one of them. Upon leaving we noticed that there were complimentary bite-sized red velvet cakes and bottles of water, nice touch. The dining room and bar are very nicely decorated with dim lighting. They do have an expansive menu. I must say the bartender was very nice and tried to be helpful. We may give this place another try."}
{"text":"Really great service! Great happy hour! And awesome
Tito's and Tonic!!!! Loved the fact they don't use a gun for the tonic and had great carbonation. Also the fries are amazing and the steak salad and prime rib sandwich were perfect!  Definitely will be back.  Appreciated the fact that it was actually reasonably priced too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, and I met wonderful people.
I've never been here before and I was meeting a friend down the street at some Mexican place so after he left I came in here and boy was it packed a little too crowded for happy hour but as far as talking to people excellent crowd."}
{"text":"Friends recommend this restaurant.  Went there today 5:00. Asked about Happy Hour told to seat ourselves.  After 15:00 minutes of waitresses and manager (4 times) passing our new able with no service we left.  Only thing we noticed was manager high diving there hostesses doing nothing.  Will never go back, make sure we let our friend know who recommended the restaurant and anyone else we can tell not to go"}
{"text":"Awesome.  From the moment we arrived, our server Lori was friendly and attentive. It was half-price wine Wednesday and we got a great bottle at a great price. We then had an awesome calamari and then moved on to the best rack of lamb and bone in ribeye that we have had in a long, long time. This is definitely worth a look and much better and more affordable than Mastro's. The manager came by and made sure that everything was to our liking and we had a very perfect evening. We also had the artesian Mac & cheese and the cream corn. Servings are very generous and we brought lots of food home with us for another evening of great eating.  We will definitely be making a return visit."}
