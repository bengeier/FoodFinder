{"text":"This is a go-to place for when I have out-of-town visitors.  If you like spicy food like I do, this is heaven!! I'm not sure if there's a huge difference between traditional and medium (mild is also an option.. just not an option for me), but even the medium dishes will get your sweat glands going!  My favourite dishes are the dan dan noodles and the mapo tofu.  Your stomach will probably hate you the next day, but it's so delicious that it makes it all worth it!!"}
{"text":"Good authentic dishes, but staff need to be taught better customer service. Ordered online take out, arrived half an hour later and paid, was told to have a seat. So I sat down in the waiting area in the entrace hall. Spent over half an hour waiting before I went back to the dining area to find my order was sitting in the back getting cold and no one came to tell me it was ready. If the customer has come and paid, why would you not go to the waiting area and give them their order when it is ready?"}
{"text":"Like I said, this restaurant is worthy of my return. And hubby and I did just that two days after our first visit. This time we brought a different friend. Our experience was a bit different from the last. It was Saturday dinner time. We had to wait for a good 20 minutes before we were seated. I'd not recommend the Chili pepper chicken with bones, what a waste of money. The total number of chicken cannot fill a rice bowl! So far, our all time favorite is Shredded pork with fish sauce. We like the bamboo shoots and Jews ears in it. Tried 3 new dishes this time: Beef flank + tendon stew, Pig's ear(cold dish) and the aforementioned Chili pepper chicken w bones."}
{"text":"Szechuan Restaurant replaced Cheung's Garden on 16th Avenue Northwest in the Crescent Heights area. While most of the Chinese food served in Calgary (and in the West, in general) is either Cantonese or Mandarin, Szechuan Restaurant is one of the only places (or at least the best) in Calgary where one can enjoy an authentic Sichuan meal. Those who can't handle spice, be fore-warned! You will definitely be sweating, or maybe not-so-glamorously dashing to the bathroom to attend to your draining sinuses. The prices are more than reasonable and there is ample parking. What more could a spice-seeker ask?   The food is consistently delicious every time I go there. Unless you really know what you're getting yourself into, I suggest you order your dishes to be 'medium spicy'. My favourites at Szechuan Restaurant are (in order of appearance on the menu):  - #31 - Szechuan Dan Dan Noodle - #70 - Boiled Sliced Beef in Hot Sauce (or alternatively 46, which is the same, only with fish) - #79 - Hot Chili Pepper Chicken (with bones) -  #85 - Spicy Kung Po Chicken with Peanuts  You can of course order the traditional meat dishes here such as shredded pig's ear (#13/14), beef tripe, pork blood (#100), etc. There's something for everyone! =)"}
{"text":"This is some of the most well done and authentic Chinese food in Calgary. It is the only restaurant I've found that serves authentic Szechuan dishes that are normally found on the other side of the pacific. The spice is turned down a notch (especially if you are caucasian) than what is normally found in Szechuan cooking but the dishes remain spicier than what is found at other restaurants in Calgary. If you are feeling up for a challenge, explain to the waiter that you know how spicy the traditional food is and that you love it cooked that way. Overall a fantastic place."}
{"text":"I have a huge love affair with the food here.  I have yet to have a bad meal - everything I've tried has been amazing.  My personal faves are the Dan Dan Noodles, Beef with Black Fungus and Chili and the Fried Rice with Pork & Green Chili.  I always order my food traditional hot and think its the best way to order here.  Outside of being perfectly spicy its also so flavourful.  I always stop here when in Calgary whether it be to eat in or bring an order home to eat the next day.  Really wish this restaurant would transplant itself to Red Deer!"}
{"text":"I liked how spicy the food was, and liked that it had a lot of flavour. I was disappointed with how tough and chewy the beef was in the ginger beef, also didn't find it crispy, had a little too much breading. The veggie fried also had lots of flavour but had too much egg for my liking."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times because I like spicy food  even though their service is always so so. But the last Saturday Aug 27 when I visited with may family was  worst, so I decided not to go again to this place forever. At that time I ordered 4 dishes with rice, but our food was not served until waiting more than 30 minutes. The most upsetting was that other guests were served first who came later than we though one of foods I ordered was cold food, always served quickly and firstly. The feeling that we might be ignored intentionally other than  Chinese guests made me more upset and we're actually informed of nothing in spite of so long wait. Their staff've been always so so and not well trained, so I didn't expect much, but it's worst that I've experienced. The food? spicy like other Szechuan food, but not Szechuan delicious I experienced in authentic Szechuan restaurants."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Calgary for a 2-day travel. We heard that this is the best Szechuan cuisine in Calgary so we headed there for dinner. We have to say that this is a decent restaurant, but certainly falls short of our expectation. We spent $13 for a small size of  \"fish fillet in chili oil\" (Shui Zhu Yu) and it had less fish than we expected. The Fish-Flavored Shredded Pork (Yu Xiang Rou Si) tastes fine (although a little bit too sweet and not spicy enough). I guess this is the best you can get in Calgary area. The overall price is more expensive than a restaurant of the same level in the US."}
{"text":"The menu has many dishes you won't find at other Chinese eateries in the city, so head here if you're looking to spice things up (in more ways than one). That being said, it gets only four stars because eating here is a bit of Szechuan Roulette unless you have an expert guide. This is because the menu describes most of the huge assortment of dishes only by meat cut and major veg, assuming the reader knows what the traditional sauce and other accompaniments...eating authentic ethnic is a double edged sword!  This restaurant is in a considerably larger building than before, but service was pretty prompt, if slightly \"lost in translation\" both times we've gone. The prices are quite reasonable, but don't go expecting a light meal...I'm pretty sure everything is made with plenty of oil. Maybe it's a good spot to bring a ravenous but not-so-picky vegetarian?"}
{"text":"I didn't know we even had a Szechuan Restaurant here in Calgary.  This is an excellent restaurant and the prices were very reasonable compared to the portions.  You should note that it is not a big restraunt and the seating can be tight.  I recomend that you bring at least 3 people because the seat by the door gets cold FAST.  My other complaint was the parking situation.  Do not park in the Co-Op parking lot.  The lot behind the restaurant is limited and I had difficulty finding parking.   Aside from that, the dishes are prepared quickly.  The service staff was great and they asked you how  spicy you want your dishes.  I really liked the green beans with garlic.  I would definitely go back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Good authentic Chinese food! One of my favorite! Need to get their Hui Guo Rou, Sui Zhu Yu, Fu Qi Fei Pian and more! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Wow!  First tried it on Mother's Day  based on the yelp reviews - and wow! Am I ever glad I did. There are some great suggestions in the other reviews, and I'm still enjoying the Don Don noodles 9medium) on day 2.  Its hard to get good Chinese food that challenges your taste buds, and provides a new take - but these guys did it!  My order was take out, and without a menu, they did a great job at making suggestions.  Yummy yummy, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of spicy food, this place is a must for you! This place has become one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary. I was introduced to this gem by my friend and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend lived in the Szechuan province in China for a year and a half, and he said that the food here is definitely authentic. I trusted his word, and I'm glad I did! If you are not big into spice, you might not like it. But, you can order the dishes milder if you want. My favorites are the green beans cooked with chili peppers, the hot sauce fish soup, the jelly bean curd (a cold dish, but it is still pretty spicy), and the hot pepper chili chicken. Service is polite and prompt. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"i only have one thing to say.  \"water boiled fish\".  most amazing szechuan style thing i've put into my mouth.  very spicy (saying a lot since I regularly eat ultra spicy, and put ghost peppers into my homemade pizzas) and very delicious."}
{"text":"Super authentic and SO affordable - they also have great hours through out the week! There's pretty much nothing else you can ask for.   I love how their spicy things are ACTUALLY SPICY! This one particular dish - I think the cold chicken noodle (or something like that) is a personal favourite - It's spicy, a little bit sweet, but all quite refreshing and I find myself in pain from the chili oil but still craving for more!   You should seriously go, if you're a spicy food lover!"}
{"text":"I moved away from Calgary a few years ago but I make sure to come here every time I'm back (this restaurant's Chinese name translates to 'Fragrance of Sichuan'). I am a Sichuan native and this restaurant is owned by a wonderful Sichuanese lady who makes food that is so completely different than Cantonese, Shanghainese or any other type of Chinese regional cuisine. I was recently in LA and even the sichuan restaurants there couldn't compare, I've only had as good in Vancouver. Make sure to try to their signature 'boiled beef slices in hot sauce' - while sounding very unexciting is actually a famous traditional chinese dish (the name is hard to translate). It's so good that I bag up my leftovers (even if it's just oil) and drizzle it over whatever I make the next day (it's _that_ good)."}
{"text":"They have the best Szechuan food ever!! The reason I gave 4 stats is that their service was not very good after they move to their new location. Apparently, they were too rush to open and didn't do any renovation in the new place, all the furnitures were the old ones from the pervious \"sushi king\". And the waitresses were very very rude!! I guess because they just moved, they still haven't adapt to their new location. And they put the heat at a low temperature, so your food will get cold very soon. I hope they could do some improvement ASAP"}
{"text":"I come here at least once every 2 weeks (if not weekly). The food is addictive! If it's your first time here, I would recommend trying the following dishes:  Salt & Pepper Eggplant Hot chili pepper chicken without bones Szechuan Boiled Beef (don't let the name fool you and don't eat the tiny Szechuan peppercorns!) Hot and Sour Potato Noodles Hot and Sour Soup Hot Chili Fish Fillet  There are also different levels of spiciness offered. I always go for the traditional spicy (Level 3 if you will) because I can handle it. I would recommend trying things at level 1 or baby spicy first and come back again to try a higher level of spice.  LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Every time we head to Calgary, we have to stop here at least once.   Why?   Because the food here is delicious and my wife loves Szechuan cuisine.   We went over the long weekend and ordered a few dishes - Spicy Jelly Bean Curd, Sweet & Sour chicken and Bok Choi & Mushrooms. The Jelly Bean curd resembles rice noodles and it is a fiery little dish that is served cold. I can't handle it, but my wife loves it.   The Sweet & Sour Chicken was great - and different from almost every other place I've ever had it. Instead of putting a tiny piece of chicken inside a lump of dough, they lightly flour it and then fry it. Then after it's cooked, they add pineapples, peppers and onions and a sauce that is more tart than sweet. The result is a dish of crispy chicken that stimulates your taste buds with both sweet and sour, instead of the usual soggy lumps in sickeningly sweet sauce.  The Bok Choi & Mushrooms was just okay for a vegetable dish. They left the bok choi quite crispy. I would have preferred it cooked for another minute or two, as well as a bit more flavour in the sauce. Still, for a plain veggie dish, it wasn't bad.   All in all, the food here is great, the service is quick and the place is almost always busy (a sign that the food is great).   WARNING: If you cannot handle spicy food, don't bother going. Spicy food here will literally blow your roof off. It is not for those with meek palates!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: Do not eat here if you do not like spicy, mouth-numbing food. Szechuan dishes, for the most part, should be burning your face off. That being said, I have eaten mild spicy and medium spicy dishes here with less enthusastic friends and the flavours were lacking compared to when you order \"hot\". Always order hot and you will receive consistent results each time you eat here.  Sometimes we would order medium and the dishes were lacking in flavour. I thought maybe it was because they had a different crew that night, but no... it was because if you want the full experience, you have to order the dish hot.   One of my favorite dishes is the Ma Po Tofu and the deep fried Tofu triangles. Shredded pork is always a good bed, as is Kung Po Chicken and any of the veggie dishes. Try some of the soups as well.. very tasty.   Szechuan peppercorns are present in nearly all of the \"hot\" dishes. These little buggers have a bit of a \"soapy\" aftertaste/lingering taste, and they make your water taste lemony, but no worries... that is how it should be."}
{"text":"Amazing food, flavorful, and exactly what we were looking for. Fast and friendly service.  I loved everything we ordered and I will definitely return or recommend to others."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I love spicy food, i moved from Calgary to Vancouver and still have not found a Szechuan restaurant that is as spicy as his place. I am glad to see they moved 1 block east to a much larger location (it was hard to get a table for 2 before) We had the Ma po Dofu, Spicy chili chicken, and Tan Tan noodle......Everything was spicy and fresh....Staff is really friendly and prices are reasonable.... If only they would open a franchise in Vancouver with the same recipes i would be set."}
{"text":"If you want real authentic Szechuan, this is the place to go!  But understand what real Szechuan is, very very spicy!  They do ask you how spicy you would like your dish and you ask for moderately spicy if you're not brave enough, ;)."}
{"text":"It's like a million burning needles tap dancing on your tongue. The flavors are excellent, but \"mild\" will still probably be too hot for the average bear. Not your typical Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The food is OK minus.  Too much MSG. Service is good not great. Definitely not a three or four star restaurant."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of this place!  The husband and I are addicted to spicy food, and Szechuan Restaurant is as spicy as it comes! It is a tad nicer than regular chinese restaurants, and the service is quite good. But you're here for the food, let's face it. And that is, if you're a fire-breathing spice fanatic like us. If you can't handle 'holy sh** my mouth is on fire' sensation, do yourself a favour and stay far away.  Our FAVOURITE dishes here:  - Boiled fish in hot sauce soup (For the bravest of the brave! Top tip: eat the fish and take the sauce home with you, and use it to boil your veggies for the next four days. You're welcome.) - Chilli chicken (Also for the bravest of the brave!) - Cold bean curd noodles  - Green beans - Fried asparagus - Tea smoked duck (this is for you non 'spice eaters' if you didnt pay heed to my warnings and ended up there anyway. Order this. It's safe.)  Another top tip: Order a cold Tsing-Tao to wash down the spicy food. It's a delicious pairing!"}
{"text":"I love hot food. REALLY hot and spicy food (despise bland, why bother?), so I was very grateful to be introduced to this place by fellow Yelpers. I have driven by this place too many times and had not taken notice of it. Maybe I was unsure of what to expect but one thing is for sure, I will be back here again! There were 9 of us and this restaurant can certainly accommodate large groups seamlessly. The large tables and lazy Susans... bliss for sharing. The service was polite and although we had to ask for a few things, they were brought out swiftly. Their main focus service-wise was getting our food out to us quickly, nice and hot. YUMMY it was. Such flavour! I could not possibly list all the dishes we ordered but my faves were the Kung Pao Chicken and the Asparagus.  Magic in every bite. And affordable. We got tea and steamed rice to accompany everything and let me tell you, every morsel of food and drink was gobbled up! We had a really great time and all took turns with our fortune cookies reading them out loud... :) I did not find the food too spicy at all but I guess it depends on what you order and your tolerance level. No dessert served here apparently but there are plenty of other places in the area for that. There is on site parking which is nice. I imagine Sundays here would be crazy busy but Saturdays for lunch, no problem to park.  Did you know your water tastes like sweet sugar liquid after consuming 100 chiles?"}
{"text":"As I know 7 styles so far from living in Asia for 13 years, as a rule I consider Szechuan/Sichuan cuisine to be hotter (spicier) than the other Chinese styles. For those of us with an aversion to heat or with a twitchy or sensitive throat, it's best to order the least spicy dishes, even though they are not in their accustomed \"traditional\" style.  The staff.  As I know a little Mandarin with Taiwanese inflections, I was able to order mostly in Chinese, and was served with efficiency. One young waiter was most gracious in helping us choose dishes.  The food. First time, ordering the wonton (wundun) soup proved to be a good lead-in, and although I've had better, the pork was nicely spiced and the broth quite good.  For my main, ordered the small order of the boiled basa with mildest spiciness, and was greeted by a large bowl brimming with lightly flavored basa and bean sprouts, lots of chili peppers and milder spices that enhanced the flavour of the broth. Another pleasant surprise was the small bowl of small-grained rice: it was light and incredibly fluffy and distinctly a pleasant addition to the spice-heavy meal.  On our 2nd visit, we ordered a black bean noodle dish and szechuan chicken with mixed vegetables in garlic/spicy sauce.  Fairly good with strong black bean flavour, and nicely-accented chicken, straw mushrooms, celery, cabbage, carrots, potato, and black fungus, all without too much heat. Such different fare from standard Cantonese and other styles... As is often usual in middle-class establishments, we did take-out and had 3 more meals of the dishes at home. With over 20 large chilis, flavours carried forward well (smile).  But two things showed up: 1.  unlike one small chinese restaurant in a small northern BC town, the black bean flavour was not greatly enhanced by a chef's craft, and the noodles were inferior and overcooked. 2.  as sometimes shows up, chinese restaurant owners may serve the poor meat items to those who either luck out or are deemed deserving of more bones than meat, more tripe than tender prime slices. As this was the case when we received more chopped little pieces than usual, on reflection I can only downgrade this resto to 3.5!  The menu has about 300 items, and should suit any taste. It may be, however, that ingredients are flipped in and out, but possibly similar / same sauces are used for many dishes.  Although with a fairly old decor, it was warmly lit partly by the evening sun glowing through the coloured glass skylight, and the bathrooms, although not immaculate, were pleasant enough.  With these reservations, good to know of its existence..."}
{"text":"You'd think that the popularity of Iron Chef, Szechuan Cuisine (which obviously due to Chen Kinichi's wins- reigned supreme) would exist in Calgary by a competitive handful.  Instead, google Szechuan and only one place dares to makes it claim as a Szechuan restaurant. It's not a bold dare, considering no one felt like coming up with a witty name and named their restaurant SZECHUAN RESTAURANT. So for a while I ignorantly ignored this place, there were other cuisines to obsess about. It wasn't until I went to NYC that I got a chance to try Szechuan in Chinatown. Holy Shit Fuck Hell that was some hot food...but it's delicious and  a sinful masochistic experience. So much hot peppers, so much broken willpower.  Fast forward to several week ago when a good buddy of mine, who after years of training with revealed himself as a New York Foodie (props to Rueben!) insisted that Szechuan Restaurant is the best he's ever had, better than any Szechuan place he's stepped into in the Big Apple. So yeah. I HAD to go.  aaaand I needed wingmen, so I deployed the bro-horn and called upon Kenny M and Chris Sabz. We ordered three dishes: Kung Pao Chicken (traditional hot), ma po tofu (medium), sweet and sour fried fish, and their house special fried rice. The Kung Pao was impressive, the chicken was fresh and packed with flavor extracted from the Szechuan hot peppers (which are not to be trifled with, watch out of these buggers). I've never had Kung Pao but Kenny mentioned this is what he imagined it's SUPPOSED to taste like, unlike the fast food tripe churned out down south. I was fighting back the beads of sweat the collected on my scalp while Chris coolly chewed the Kung Pao. The Ma Po tofu was milder but still had a sting of heat, which perfectly elevated it's spices, coupled with the silken tofu's texture, it was tasty eating over the savory house fried rice.  Finally their sweet and sour fried fish was the perfect dish to contrast the supreme standout heat of the Kung Pao. In fact this dish was just perfect in itself. The fish was fried so well that it was moist and buttery on the inside but the battered crust was perfectly crisp and held its own against the heavy sweet and sour sauce that had this dark molasses colour and consistency. When my buddies became too immersed in conversation I immediately grabbed the last 3-4 pieces and felt NO SHAME WHATSOVER.  Our bill was just as good, a meal in which each person didn't get past the $20 mark. I can't wait to get back here and push the limits of my sweat barrier."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner and was promptly seated and served tea. I told the waiter I don't speak mandarin (I'm Cantonese) and was pleasantly surprised to get great service despite ordering in English. Believe me, you'd be surprised how some other places change on you....  Any who, I ordered the water boiled fish. The waiter told me to get mild if it was my first time here, since apparently their traditional is scaldingly spicy and I'm glad I listened. The mild is pleasantly spicy, with nice filets of fish, bean sprouts and some sliced napa cabbage. But what really sets this place apart from other Szechuan restaurants where I've had this dish is the amount of flavor in the dish without the obligatory 1/4-1/2 inch of chili oil on top (I'm guessing thats the super spicy version). But even then for \"mild,\" to get one of the best renditions of this classic szechuan dish without the greasy regret feeling after words is almost nothing short of a culinary miracle. So kudos to Szechuan Restaurant.  Prices are a little on the higher side but they give you a plethora of food to make up for it. You definitely won't go hungry. So bring a friend or two and split some spicy food and be happy."}
{"text":"The spices and flavours were mildy 'OK\".  I've been here several times and tried several dishes.  The wontons have a fresher taste about them than other fast food chinese places, albeit a bone or two or grit from being hastily ground.  The sliced beef with veggies is barley cooked and very greasy, like all great chinese food places.  I dont see why this place is #1 in calgary rated by avenue, as it is definitly not.  The menu is too large.    The chili's thrown in make this authentic \"schezuqan\" food,  then again I could just throw sriracha on everything or just squeeze a bottle of sriracha into my throat for dinner.   The large pots are ideal for sharing and great for takeaway.  The tea smoked duck is mostly bone and grisle and fat.  When I get bbq duck from T&T supermarket its alot more meat and alot more flavourfull.  The Duck definitly had a taste of 'bbq'd weeks ago - etc.    Its nothing to write home about.  A few gripes are the ginger beef was pink inside, and still raw.  The medium on the ginger beef was just right amount of chili's.  They take the time to hollow the chilli's out so you are not getting the full seed for a medium spice flavour.  I dont think i will go back again."}
{"text":"I was feeling like eating Szechuan food, so typed szechuan into Yelp and after perusing a few restaurants, settled on this one, based on the overall rating and the reviews.  The food here was excellent. Started off with #6 (spicy something curd jelly). The title of the dish might sound a tad unappetizing (to a white guy), but this cold appetizer is freaking delicious. I'm definitely going to order it again next time I come to Szechuan Restaurant (and yes, this restaurant is on my WILL RETURN list, for sure.)  Had the sweet and sour fish slices. The sweet and sour sauce was yummy. Nothing at all like the pink cloying sweet (and sour) sauce you get with Canadian chinese food.  Had green beans and garlic and something with pork (it's on the first few all-colour pages). (Wish these guys had a website, so that I could remember the names of the dishes.)  Great food. The atmosphere inside reminds me of some of my favourite chinese places in Richmond BC. Highly recommended.  (Parking can be a little difficult. Not much room in back, and the Co-Op has a tonne of \"We Will Tow You\" signs.)"}
{"text":"Yay for real spicy food in Calgary!  The place isn't too hard to find but finding parking at this restaurant almost requires some geo-caching or detective skills.  We finally found the little lot behind the restaurant connected to the alleyway but there are only about five spots there, so better look for street parking elsewhere.  Since we parked in the back, we went in through the kitchen and saw the sausage making process up close, so to speak.  Seeing the kitchen did nothing to enhance the dining experience, but thankfully the food was good enough I was able to forget about the standing piles of dirty dishes in murky water.  ;)  The menu is plentiful and the waitress was helpful and recommended some dishes for us.  I think she was pleased when we convinced her that we really were interested in genuinely hot dishes.  The shui zhu yu was nicely spicy, had plenty of the numbing flower pepper (prickly ash) that we love so much, and was the best version of this dish I have enjoyed in a while.  We had an interesting cumin lamb dish which reminded me of the spices at the Little Fat Lamb (Xiao Fei Yang) hot pot in the Bay Area.  The only downside is that the prices were on the high side.  Perhaps it is because it is tough to source fresh ingredients for Szechuan cuisine in a place like Calgary?"}
{"text":"8 years in Canada and this is the most Sichuan restaurant you'll find in Calgary.  The restaurant has a nice Chinese atmosphere, as if you were at a Chinese restaurant in China. The food here is awesome but sometimes they are way too salty (almost not enjoyable without rice), and there are some small hygiene problems.  The portion of food they give for the price is a lot compared to other Chinese restaurants.  Very recommended if you're looking for actual Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food in an assuming spot off Edmonton Trail. Very reasonably priced and tasty!"}
{"text":"pretty legit food. one of the few restaurants that i've been to that actually comes somewhat close to sichuan food in china.  spice level is definitely on par! there's the equivalent of mild, medium, and spicy (we ordered in chinese, so i'm roughly translating here) -- and the \"medium\" was definitely pretty spicy! enough to knock out most of the people at the table. personally i enjoyed the \"medium\" spice level a lot, but that makes me scared about how truly spicy the \"spicy\" is. just for reference, in a typical restaurant that advertises spicy food, i can usually eat an 8-9 on a scale of 10. so yea.. order accordingly.  spicy food aside, their non-spicy dishes tend to favor the sweet/sour side rather than the savory side. not really my cup of tea, but just putting that out there.  the restaurant is pretty sizable and can accommodate large parties of people. service is also friendly and fast, so all around a great experience. would definitely recommend trying to residents and visitors of the calgary area."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I had in a long time! I will definitely be coming back every time I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, with a lot of the more authentic dishes (don't be shocked to see organs on the menu) in addition to the more popular westernized ones (e.g. beef broccoli).  My suggestions: the small wonton soup is great and actually quite large, and instead of getting chicken fried rice, get the more traditional chicken and salt fish fried rice."}
{"text":"Our family recently visited this restaurant for the first time on a Sunday evening. We have become a little addicted to Szechuan food and crave it with some regularity. There is something about the infusion of food  with the aroma of spicy dried chili peppers and the floral Szechuan peppercorns that keeps us coming back.  The menu of this restaurant has to be one of the most extensive I have ever encountered in a Chinese restaurant (see posted photos of the entire menu). Picking out dishes seems a little daunting at first but one soon starts to recognize old favorites amongst the many options. Not only are there many menu items, the items also have sub options that are usually shown in parentheses () and separated by / marks. For example, if you order item no.3, which are deep fried pork ribs, you can have them finished with honey, or with /garlic, or /salt & pepper style or /dried chili pepper style. On top of that, with any spicy dishes, the spice level can be adjusted to mild, moderate or hot (the latter one being the \"normal\" Szechuan spice level). We are used to eating spicy food but we still ordered everything \"mild\" and I was glad we did. It was just right for us and I am sure the regular spice would have caused some personal gastrointestinal disturbances later on :).  We ordered the grilled pork dumplings (2) (nice), deep fried pork ribs - chili pepper style (3) (very tasty), house fried rice (66) (probably one of the better versions I have had - it was good and the mild version was not spicy at all), dried chili pepper chicken (191) (very nice), sliced fish with mixed vegetable in hot sauce dry pot (241) (very good), the hot crispy eggplant (221) (very nice - never had it that way before, it was almost like eating eggplant fries) and pea shoots with garlic (229) (one of the best versions I have ever had). I am not sure how prices compare to the area but the portions were certainly quite large so we quickly realized we ordered a bit too much. However, we just kept on eating because the food was so good and finally waddled out of the restaurant very satisfied. Highly recommended!  P.S. The restaurant has what I would describe as an informal family atmosphere. It almost felt like I was eating at somebody's dinner party at times. There were lots plant and flower decorations around. There was a bit of Chinese music playing in the background. There were a number of Asian families and groups of friends eating and clearly having a good time. Some little kids were walking around and others were watching videos on their iPads. I could clearly hear the cook preparing the food and the dishwasher cleaning up from where were seating. It all contributed to this low level background noise which made for a lively atmosphere. Perfect for family and friend groups but maybe not so much for a romantic dinner :).  Our waitresses were friendly and efficient. Upon seating us, she immediately brought out hot tea. We had to ask her for water but she brought it out quickly once we had asked for it. There was only one menu on our table but there were a couple of extra ones on the empty adjacent table so one could just grab one there. Our waitress was surprised when we asked for extra white rice since we had already ordered a fried rice dish but then brought out the white rice quickly and with a smile (no way one order of fried rice would be enough with three teenage boys!). Anyway, these are examples to show you had to take your own initiative a bit but also that the service was friendly, fast and accommodating. At the end you pay your check at the cashier. Our meal had been worth every penny of it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing but mild is all most people can handle. We had the Kow Pow Chicken and Pow blew My tongue away. My wife found it spicy hot to the extreme and had to mix in some of our Chicken Corn Soup. We also had the sliced beef with celery and Chilli sauce that was awesome!   Be careful not to bite into any of those long red Chillies that seem to infuse every dish. Unless you can handle suicidal hot."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite restaurant but they're constantly being shut down for pests and leaving meat at room temperature overnight.  People joke about restaurants being unclean but avoid this place.  You'll get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.   If you're coming here, be prepared for some spicy food. Do not back out of ordering real Sichuan spicy, or else you'll get some mediocre attempt at Westernizing the dish.  Please educate yourselves before visiting, or else you might risk hours of confusion over the menu: http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/what-is-sichuan-szechuan-chinese-cuisine.html"}
{"text":"Although the food is good. There is shortage of waiters and waitresses during the lunch time. Also many of their menu items are empty; which is frustrating."}
{"text":"I'm in the restaurant now. They have brought the wrong dish and refuse to take it back. The \"boss\" won't come out of the back to deal with the issue.    Bad experience.   If you don't like dirt stay away. Display shelves are layered with dust and grime."}
{"text":"So hot it's cool!  Speaking as a foodie and a chinese kid, I've always admired and enjoyed properly done Szechuan cooking.  Flavourful, filling, rich in taste and comprised of the key staples of chinese cooking, but with one distinction.... it's #%$##%^ HOT!    This little oddly placed restaurant on 16th Ave North, just a few blocks from Center street, fits those requirements perfectly.  It's dead on authentic, and this is speaking from first hand experience with some of the best restos in Canada and Hong Kong.  Spicy as heck, it's a place where you expect to sweat while enjoying some of their incredible creations with tofu, beef, vegetables and meat.  I honestly can't say enough about it, but only that you shouldn't go if you have ulcer problems.    Just a few quick words, being on the North side of 16 Av, it's also pretty freaking hard to get to.  You HAVE to approach by the westward direction of 16 Av and Center, and stay to the right side.  It's going to come up pretty damn quick.  Also, there's really not much parking around there, so be prepared to walk a little.  Outside of that, I really should try to organize a yelp dinner or something there.  I think my fellow Yelpers would love it there."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had!,.. Super sloooooooow!... And the food was not good at all, very very spicy, Even when I ordered it mild, and the waiter said that was the mildest one....  I definitely do not want to go back there!"}
{"text":"I loved cheung's garden, so I was saddened to see it closed with a sign for Szechuan Restaurant.  But of course, one should always try before casting judgement and fortunate that's just what I did. As I write this, I'm actually here on my second visit, enjoying (and sweating from) the spice.  I don't know the exact translated names for the dishes I ordered, but i made sure to have some tsing Tao beer with it all. I'm writing fromy phone and will try to add pictures of the dishes later on.  The staff is friendly and helpful, while the food is authentic and delicious.  Definite recommend over self styled posh bistros serving the exact same dishes as every other resto-lounge following this very tired concept. Bring on ethnic food any day, I say!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for people love authentic Sichuan Chinese food!! Absolutely fantastic! Don't miss their weekday specials including the most favorable boiling fish. Ask for 'raw' spicy and you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Wow!!  If you like spicy, this restaurant is for you.  Chillies and loads of chillies!  Szechuan is a province in China, famous for their red chillies and spicy food.  In all Chinese food, there is a yin-yang effect.  If there's hot and spicy food, then there'll also be clear and not spicy dishes to compliment.   We had dinner on Friday night and what we ordered may be exotic for some:  - Tofu, Mushrooms and Sea Cucumber Soup - clear broth and so refreshing to drink - Beef Tripe, Pork Blood, Tofu, Luncheon Pork, Sliced Beef - it was like a big bowl of stew and so spicy and hearty - eat with rice - Hot Chilli Pepper Chicken (Boneless) - Yes, chiili city - loads of dried red chillies that were fried in oil and then cooked with the chicken - so scrumptious! - Fried Green Beans with Groud Pork in Garlic Sauce - lovely fresh green beans with loads of garlic - Beef Fried Noodles - looked plain but so delicious with tons of garlic and flavour  Hotpot Special:  Adults $23.98/person and $10.98/kid  -  Looks good - will try next time.  You get a clear broth for free.  If you want different soups, you have a selection of soups to pick from with an extra charge.  The cook/owner came out during our dinner and checked on us.  We told her we loved the hot spicy food and she was thrilled.  The owner could speak Mandarin, Szechuan and English.    Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food ever.  Highly recommend green beans , bbq fish (order mild - medium is quite spicy) and ginger beef (you haven't tasted ginger beef like this)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Very authentic ?? dishes. This is a restaurant my family and I will definitely revisit if/when we are back in town."}
{"text":"After a week in the national park I finally got some Chinese food. The soup of fish with pickled veggi tasted good, but the fish itself seems to be over marinated...the small spicy beef and lung was good, quite a lot beef not much lung though, and price increased from 8.98 to 11.98. They charge 1.95 for one rice which is high as I got rice for free with dishes in USA."}
