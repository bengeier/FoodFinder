{"text":"This a perfectly fine place to stop for a cold brew on a sweltering day.  It seems funny that such a cavernous place could be so empty, but I guess it's the night crowd they're after...and based on previous reviews, I'll avoid that like the plague.  My only complaint is that the floor is so sticky in places that I literally lost a flip-flop.  However, with its window bar seating, this is now tied for Irish Pub for best people watching spot."}
{"text":"This is a horrible bar, mainly because of the shady figures who congregate their. I've gone here since it used to be called the pub and 2 days ago, Friday March 2nd, had my coat stolen. My coat contained my phone, car keys, and apartment keys, as well as a flask that had sentimental value to it. WHO STEALS COATS? Seriously, if you need money that badly, do anything else. I was left stranded without a way to get home or contact anyone to help me.  I've kept on hoping that it was just a mistake, that someone drunkenly grabbed it, but no one turned in anything on the following days.  The employees were of no help whatsoever, and ushered me out during closing time. When I tried calling later that night, I was told to call back at 11am and hung up on. In the 2 days since then, I've called and visited the place only to be given dumbfounded looks and no pity.   As for the actual bar itself, it's not much better. The main draw is the live music, which is about 80% country/rock and 20% pop/rap. It's not the best music, and there are always about 20 guys lurking around for every 1 girl there. Drinks are expensive and useless.  Moral of the story: GO HERE IF YOU WANT YOUR STUFF STOLEN BY SHADY PEOPLE.  THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE: http://m.host.madison.com/mobile/article_40102d6c-fc00-11e0-b4ec-001cc4c002e0.html  I have lost any hope of finding my items, have filed police reports, spent every waking hour stressing out by scouring the internet to no avail, and have been just generally been the most miserable I've been in an extremely long time-all thanks to one horrible night at Whiskey River."}
{"text":"Walked in around 11am after the Shamrock shuffle to get a drink and warm up. It was pretty clean and very big with a large beer selection. We got Bloody Mary and a fuzzy navel to start and switched to green beer. I can't comment what it is like at night but I'd be happy to go there again during the afternoon on a weekend for a drink. The bartender was alone and busy but did ok."}
{"text":"This bar deserves 0 stars. My first and only time going to this place was a horrible experience. All was fine until my boyfriend was pushed off the dance stage by Whiskey Jack's security, proceeded to fall flat on his face and spill his drink entirely on himself. Obviously embarrassed, and luckily not hurt (for Whiskey Jack's sake), him and I left having not finished our drinks.   Within the next few days I attempted to communicate through Facebook involving the injustice I believe to have happened, including a post explaining the situation in its entirety. Whiskey Jack's simply deleted my comment on their page with no apology or message of any kind. What complete disrespect from a business! Also being in contact with the police regarding the incident, we later learned Whiskey Jack's has a strict \"female-only on the dance stage\" rule. Bull-$hit. I'm a male and I wasn't forced off the stage.   If you're looking for a bar that treats you like a money-spending customer should be treated, this bar is the furthest from it. I still wouldn't step foot in the place and even to this day tell everyone this story. Word of mouth can help you or hurt you, and Whiskey Jack's shows this as I never hear anything good about this dump.   Wouldn't recommend it, my money is better spent elsewhere, and I don't need an establishment to tell me who can go on a stage and who cannot when everyone is out to have a good time. Shame on Whiskey Jack's."}
{"text":"Once the Pub always the Pub.  Still a great place to get harassed by undesirables.  Although I did give it one star MORE than the Pub because they did upgrade the paint and architectural conditions inside.  Although getting better SLOWLY the service seems to be staffed by castoffs from other downtown places that didn't have the speed to make it at their old joints.  I guess it just comes down to you can't polish a turd."}
{"text":"Place is huge but I'm not entirely sure about the integrity of the bartenders. When I looked online at my bank statement I was overcharged by a couple dollars. I called about it and was told someone would get back to me, they didn't. Called again, same deal. If you do go here don't use a card."}
{"text":"My best friend came to visit from Mexico, and wanted to go out. A couple of friends said that a band was going to play at Whiskey River so we decided to head over there. there was a line and we only waited around 15 mins to get in.  The man at the door checked our id's and my friend presented his Mexican Passport to prove age. This bouncer, started going through the passport  pages and I told him the age was in main page of the passport. He said he needed to find the \"Visa\" to let him in because he wasn't a US Citizen.  This upset me because it is none of his business to look for the visa stamp, I can understand if it is and police officer, TSA, government official, but not this \"bouncer\" who gets paid to check ages.  Very unprofessional and just plain racist from his part.   After finally going in, the music was good and the band was great! until someone vomited in the middle of the dance floor (not the place's fault). it was cleaned right away. Drink prices were reasonable and the place is big.   But the bouncer ruined our experience and I will not be back to Whiskey River.   Incident happened 01/16/2011 around 11pm."}
{"text":"I had a really awful experience while visiting Whiskey Jack's. I am Canadian and after waiting 30 minutes in line to see the bouncer and was not allowed with my Canadian drivers license due to the fact it was an international form of ID, something I have never heard of before. When I asked what forms they do accept the bouncer stated passports. WHY WOULD ANY INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLER RISK LOOSING THEIR PASSPORT (and on top of that my visa allowing me to go to school in the states)TO GET INTO A BAR? Such a ridiculous waste of my time and awful customer service by the bouncer."}
{"text":"Sigh, full of creepy dudes and overall a bad experience. Plus the dress code is racist."}
{"text":"A place to get beer, drinks, pool tables, music, dance floor.  It's spacious.  Otherwise nothing exciting, but nothing I'd avoid either."}
{"text":"Seriously the most racist bar in town. They have a \"dress code\" and also I was called a \"bitch\" by a bouncer for helping out my friend who had a bit too many. When I confronted the bouncer he said that one customer's opinion doesn't matter and that he wouldn't care if I came back or not. Absolutely trashy and ignorant bar..do not ever go here unless you wanna hook up with a sloppy drunk or get harassed by the employees."}
{"text":"Whiskey Jacks Saloon is good at providing three things here in Madison: enough space to support 3+ bachelorette parties at a time, men who enjoy ogling at the members of 3+ bachelorette parties in hopes a stray will separate from the pack, and cover bands that will transition seamlessly from \"Mr. Jones\" to \"Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy\". If any of those three things are appealing to you, then you've stumbled upon a gold mine, my friend. Personally, it's not my everyday cup o' tea but that doesn't mean I haven't found myself waiting in line to get in after a long night out with the girlfriends. All you need is one of them to yell out, \"I just wanna dance\" to know you're either in for somebody pulling up a YouTube clip of Dane Cook on their smartphone or a cover-free trip to Whiskey Jacks. At that point, I'm usually only intoxicated enough to tolerate the latter.  One of my last trips to WJ lead me out onto the dance floor where I watched a gentleman make his way through the swaying crowd with a glass of wine held above his head. A young lady inevitably collided with him, causing the glass to fall to the floor. The wine glass maintained it's shape (plastic is a miracle material) but the wine was not so lucky and the man cried out, \"Damnit! Not again!\" Hello, hilarity and a few takeaways:  1. A place named \"Whiskey Jacks Saloon\" is going to disappoint you if you go there for the whiskey, let alone a glass of wine. 2. Never underestimate the breadth of movement people are capable of when Hootie & the Blowfish makes it into a live band's repertoire. 3. If you're a straight, single man, getting upset at one of the 10 girls in a crowd of 50 guys means you'll probably only be going home with a souvenir plastic wine glass at the end of the night.  Service and drinks are sub-par. Atmosphere is cheesy. Maintain reasonable expectations or move along, cowboy."}
{"text":"I want to say this is a typical college bar but I feel like even typical college bars can put Apple crown and cranberry in a cup and not make it taste like water? Somehow Whiskey Jacks did just that. My friends and I came the day before OSU was in town. It was around 8pm so it wasn't busy yet. We sat at the bar and the girl waiting on us seemed polite, but gave us terrible drinks. My buddy asked about one beer but she couldn't explain what it was but offered to give him a sample. He tried it, didn't like it and asked about a different beer on tap. She again couldn't explain if it was an amber, a lager, a stout etc. and she continues to patronizingly say I can't keep giving you free drinks. He said I don't want free drinks but it's hard to make a choice when you don't know what beers you have on tap. He went for a crappy Miller Lite to make it easy. We only stayed for one drink, but when we tried to cash out our bartender was no where to be found. We discovered she had left but I guess wasn't worried about cashing out with us... terrible bar."}
{"text":"I mean, if, like most of the crowd here, you're just or not-quite legal, and you don't mind getting panhandled while you drink, and you have shitty taste in music, and you like your shots to have six ingredients, and you're just going to go with it on the fact the bar you hang out in is a  black hole, and you've never been to any other better bar, and...well, and a lot of things, I could see this maybe being three stars. In other words, this might be just fine if you are an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin. I must admit that I had fun getting in the wayback machine and debating with/lecturing to kids 20 years my junior on how to make flaming shot cocktails. I see that vomit-tinged college pub culture hasn't changed much since 1995.   So, it isn't like I didn't know what I was getting into here; it's just that Wisconsin's bizarrely early 9pm carryout deadline (that I missed) for getting beer and going back to my room forced me to go somewhere to quench my thirst, and Whiskey Jack's happened to be the first thing I stumbled across. And they do, in fairness, have a pretty good beer selection and, like college bars nearly everywhere in the Midwest, specials that seem to be sold below wholesale. Three dollar PBR pitchers on Tuesday!? No, I'd never go back, but I'm not really sorry that I went, either."}
{"text":"Fun place and good music But can i just say how rude some of the bouncers are! Also what is the point of getting a stamp on your hand (saying that you paid your cover charge of $5 and your ID was checked) if when u step outside for fresh air etc. they wont let you back in right away but yet make you go back to the very end of the line to wait another 15 minutes to get to the front of the line just for them to wave you in right away! Literally the dumbest thing ever. VERY inconvenient for a PAYING customer if i say so myself."}
{"text":"The employees at this bar are the most unprofessional people I have ever had experience with at a bar in Madison.  My horrible experience started with a bartender, who literally threw ice at someone who was waiting for their check but not looking.  They threw ice on a patron!  Later that night my purse was stolen.  I had set it down on the stage next to my friend and walked to the bathroom 5 feet away.  Upon returning it was gone.  Shortly later, at bar time, my friend and I were looking for my purse near the back of the bar when the bouncers started screaming in their usual rude-tone to \"GET OUT OF HERE\".  I politely told them we were looking for my lost/stolen purse and was told that 'we had plenty time to look'.  Ends up he grabbed my friend by her arms and carried her across the bar (a good 50 ft) to the door. She did not incite this attack, and told him she would walk out herself-yet he would not let go. She has DARK bruises on both arms.     Come to find out that was the second purse stolen that night.  I will not be going back to this bar and will tell everyone I know how horrible of an experience it was."}
{"text":"Emo Night on May 19th was pretty cool and left me liking Whiskey's a lot, however, the negative reviews here also seem reasonable.  If the possible drink-water-down-ing could be a bummer, go to Mondays, pregame at home, or brink a flask to bump up the drinks. ;)"}
{"text":"Oh how I wished I would've read reviews before the girls and I picked this place. Idk maybe I looked like I wanted to be grinded on (at least buy me a drink). After 45 mins we left, too many creepy guys and the music kinda sucked *maybe I'm just getting old lol"}
{"text":"Ever since Mad Ave was shut down, Whiskey River has stepped up to take the crown as the trashiest bar in town. Overrated is the only thing that can describe this sticky-floored shitpile of a guido mecca. The door is manned every night by a couple of self-obsessed meatheads who flex like they own the entire sidewalk in front of the building as they harass random passers-by, and the godawful fratboy anthems blasting out of this place on every weekend night should be considered a threat to the safety and well-being of the general public."}
{"text":"Ok people, seriously?  You're in a college town filled with young people, and you go to a college bar, obviously you'll meet some creeps.   There's no reason why this place should lose out on points for living up to that stereotype.  This place is spacious, so you'll have room for all of your \"bump & grind\" and whatever it is that young kids (LOL) do these days.   The drinks are strong and cheap, which definitely seems to be a trend in Madison.   The only problem I had with this place was the sticky floors and the clientele.  There's nothing wrong with getting trashed and having some fun, but most people here are a bit too drunk. Expect to be bumped into a lot, mostly by obnoxious bros who don't have sorry in their vocabulary."}
{"text":"If you just want to drink and watch a game, Whisky Jacks may be a good place to go. It's large and has A LOT of TVs. No matter where you are in the bar, you'll be able to watch a game. Your may not be able to hear it with the music cranked up, but at least you can see it. Whiskey Jacks also has dozens and dozens of shots to chose from. If shots are your thing, they have shots for you. I will also give kudos to the security guys who were efficiently running around cleaning up tables.  However, do NOT eat here. Although the fried cheese curds were good, the hamburger and the chicken sandwich were both way overcooked. I ordered the burger medium, this was beyond well-done. The chicken was just as bad. The fries portions were also measly.  To make matters worse, our waitress was terrible. If you just want someone pretty who is able to twirl her hair, she's great, but beyond that? When we asked what kind of dark beers they had, she suggested an IPA. After ordering a beer, it took her over 20 minutes to deliver it. No, they were not that busy at the time. I hope it was her first day, but even so, wow that was bad!"}
{"text":"I waited at the bar for 15 minutes trying to get a drink for my girlfriend and I. Every attempt at making eye contact with a bar tender was denied. Horrible service, never go here."}
{"text":"I'd say the place is pretty cool. It's very different than a lot of the places around it. It reminds me heavily of a bowling alley or sports bar(more like Pooley's than anything in the area.) The live music sounds cool and the dance floor is a cool idea. The main problem I've had is the drinks -- there is not enough specials and its hard as hell to get a drink in the first place! There is also a minimum on the card that you must spend which .. I don't know, I don't think I can spend enough here on drinks to enjoy it :)"}
{"text":"Got not one but two dirty glasses and the place only has one bartender. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"If your looking to dance in Madison, this is the place to be! They play a lot of pop, hip hip and frequently have live bands, that usually play popular bar music. It's always pretty crowded there, certainly not a place to relax and have a few drinks. It's has a energetic atmosphere and is a fun place for a group of friends to go together. The prices are decent for state street. The only thing is, after 11 p.m. they usually have a long line, so good luck getting in before bar time..."}
{"text":"Bartender didn't know how to make a Manhattan. I know I'm a college student, and she was probably expecting me to order shots, but there are some of us who want an actual drink. My drink was very watery. $6 for watered down drinks isn't right. Their Orange Juice was very muddy (I didn't order it but saw it come out of the dispenser). Place was very loud, and some of the bartenders seems pretty burned out and annoyed, even if though it was a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Went to Whiskey Jacks recently, I had been here a few times before and had hoped for a better experience.... Well that didn't happen.   My better half and I get there about 945 after stopping at a few places on State Street like Mondays & The Tiki Bar. Walked into WJ and ordered some drinks. 1st drink was a blue uv with well sprite because WJ doesn't carry Mt. Dew, great guys what a start.... That will be $5.00. Wait your charging $5.00 for that drink that I just paid $4.00 for at the Tiki Bar and $3.00 at Mondays and both those places served it with Mt. Dew. What a joke. The place smelled like bleach and Pine Sol inside. The floors were sticky. Not my scene.  About an hour later the cops show up and have 3 individuals detained. Great lets slow everyone down. The bouncers looked less than excited to be dealing with these idiots who had a few too many.  A tip to WJ owners, Please offer some food, bring your drink prices down a little. Offer a wide variety of drinks and stop with the nasty smelling bar and I may come back."}
{"text":"It's a loud and annoying college bar. High prices, loud annoying music. However, that is not the reason I'm giving it a low rating. The service I received on two different occasions were both bad, and the same.   First off, coverage charge on some nights. Immediate no for me. However my friend wanted to go in so she paid the cover charges on both occasions. I ordered a single beer as I wanted it to enjoy, then be done, as I would be driving home later that night. Went to get my card back and they said I needed to spend $10 minimum on the card. Something they did not inform me of at the time of purchasing my beer. Thankfully my friend had cash to give me. That same night my friends also said they just wanted some water. The bartender gave us a dead stare and said water is $1 and he was serious. We were like... what? And he got the water for us and didn't charge. We were confused.   The second time, same issue. I had forgotten about the stupid/silly/idiotic $10 minimum on a card rule. However, this time no cash. I literrally had to leave, I told the bartender (shouting, since the bar was too loud) literally charge something on it to make it $10 or over, I didn't care. He said no he can't do it. I was irritated and walked away and waited. I really needed to leave. I waited for another bartender to come over and asked him to close it again, he said \"sure, no problem.\" got my card and closed it for me. He was nice. That was simple. Why couldn't the other guy do that.    Never coming here again."}
{"text":"This is a fun college bar with a Good DJ playing the full gambit of musical genres until 10ish. Then it was a decent cover band.  The pool tables are up front, the dance floor in the back.  Fin"}
{"text":"Two stars are for spaciousness and the availability of pool table and darts. To start with, the pool tables (2 out of 3) had problems with bills inserting. And the bar tender not sure what's his problem. Clearly not wanting to be a bar tender or what. And they don't carry any quarters? (for the pool table and games) and not even be enthusiatics to serve you drinks. The other girl bartenders later on were much sweeter, so as the security staff."}
{"text":"I rode a mechanical bull for the first time, so there's that - otherwise the music was too loud and I almost lost my voice from trying to have an actual conversation with people. Of course, there was also karaoke, and a group of folks who went on stage and totally nailed Outkast. It was amazing, and I shook it like a Polaroid picture. So yes, a good night, but that was because the place was reserved for us and QDoba was catering. Dancing to karaoke is a whole experience of its own."}
{"text":"Whiskey Jacks: the poor man's Red Rock.  One of your average college bars, but on the country side and much larger than most. However, the crowd here always seems more rowdy and obnoxious than any other bar around. There always seems to be a police presence later at night, and for good reasons.  There are dartboards and multiple pool tables, but good luck with those when the place gets busy.   The last time I went there they were asking for a cover charge...a cover charge for Whiskey Jacks? C'mon!   I decided then I would never pay a single cent just to get into that dump. Went down to Monday's afterwards and got drunk off of two drinks with what I would've spent on cover. HA!"}
{"text":"Can I go lower than 1? I guess not. I waited in their line outside for 10 minutes patiently before getting kicked out for some reason like \"disturbing the peace.\"  Apparently talking to other patrons \"violates\" that if you're not the right type of minority- docile, doesn't put up a fuss, or doesn't agree that the white people they allow in are somehow less disagreeable. Great service that doesn't recognize a skin tone less than beige."}
{"text":"Stopped by after dinner on Friday with my family & had a good time. Very large bar that had live music. I liked that there was enough space  for you to talk & hang out, shoot hoops & even dance. Bartenders were great all night."}
{"text":"Great place for young 21 yr olds who want to pass out from drinking too many fruity hangover inducing shots."}
{"text":"I asked for water & got cussed out by one of the security guards helping at the bar. Telling me this is a whiskey bar not a water bar then throwing lots of F bombs at me. Didn't know his name but he was the guy with the afro. I only give 2 stars because everyone else was super nice & the other security guards were easy on the eyes. I did like their shot specials. They have a ton of options. You do have to get two shots minimum of the same flavor doubling the price but I didn't think that was bad. It's a color coated price system ranging from $4-$6 each shot. They have a mechanical bull that looks cool & pool tables."}
{"text":"I've never been treated more rudely as a paying customer. I left my card in the ATM and gave the bartender an expired card accidentally. She told me to give her my ID while I search for my card or leave. I told her I wasn't worried about the drink I just wanted to find my card. She then said since I made her pour me the drink I had to pay for it, when my only concern was for my card. She called security over who understood what I  was getting at. Terrible service and entitled bartenders. No thanks"}
{"text":"Seriously great service , food and drinks...We were all blown away with the food - the pastrami and sauerkraut was awesome as well!! We'll be back - Party of 4  - all happy"}
{"text":"Utterly racist dress code, egregious. The bouncers are also racist, kicking out black people more than whites."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I just can't.  The crowd that hangs out here is just trashy.  I have gone here a couple different times and have always been disappointed.  I want to like this place because it has a great space, dance floor, pool tables, etc but the trashy stripperness needs to go."}
{"text":"Creeps on creeps on creeps.  Whiskey Jacks (or Whiskey River if you refuse to acknowledge the change like myself) is a great bar in concept.  It's big open space that can literally accommodate hundreds of people, and yet there is usually still a line if you get here past 11:30. They have two bars along the right and left walls so your line to the tapper shouldn't be very long. If you are into games at the bar they have quite a few billiard tables, darts and even some basketball hoops games. They do have a dress code (essentially you can't be wearing workout attire) which helps limit the creeps in the summer - they usually travel in hordes and one of them has to mess up, but in the winter everyone's so bundled up that anything goes.  The dance area is the best (if not the only real dance floor) on campus, and they have live music or a DJ every weekend. If you're here during live music you are bound to have a ton of fun, apparently a pop country sing along is not the scene for a creep. You're in the clear until after the last set when the DJ takes over, then ladies you gotta watch your back (no really, that's where they come from, try to make it as inaccessible as possible). There are lots of cute guys here, make sure you pick one to dance with, don't get prayed on. If you do, you're going to turn around to a mustached Adidas tank top that smells intensely of Indian food or body odor, you won't be able to tell which.   You can have a great time at Whiskey Jacks, just make sure you go in with a big group, your big strong boyfriend or incredibly low standards."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Drinks are a bit on the pricier for the small size but have good specials sometimes. Large and roomy. Karaoke, pool, darts and the mechanical bull all add to the appeal and the line is usually reasonable even when lines at other nearby bars are not."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison for the first time, 2 friends and I checked out the State street area upon the advice of others.  It was a Friday night, the place wasn't crazy busy yet (we we warned that it would get busy around 10 p.m.)   The service was horrible. I asked for a beer list and was told, \"We don't have one\", which was a shocker given that they have roughly 30 taps. I asked about a particular beer and she knew nothing about it but did offer me a sample which I took. I didn't like it so I asked about another and her response, \"I don't know but I can't keep giving you free samples\". I told her to give me something Amber and I couldn't finish it, it smelled horrible. It wasn't the beer that smelled, it was the glass it was poured into I believe.  My friend ordered a vodka cranberry which tasted like water a splash of Cranberry juice.  My guess is this bar's target audience is college kids who just want to get drunk."}
{"text":"Hmmm whiskeys idk. Can a bar be considered obnoxious?? Still salty for dropping 34$ at 50cent beer night. Whatever. This place is the melting pot of state st. Sloshed college students flock to make fools of themselves on sweaty dance floor (guilty). Overly confident guys flock to ride the mechanic bull and end up pulling a muscle. Middle aged weirdo dudes flock to shoot pool and creep on smokes. U better be lit like a homeless man on four lokos if you expect to have a good night at whiskeys   Edit: Haley is the best bartender there. Never had a better bartender in my life. You should give her a promotion."}
{"text":"Rudest staff I have ever interacted with. If you are 19 and hate humanity then this is the place for you. If you are of age and want to avoid stepping in vomit then avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Whiskey River Saloon is really spacious and offers a great selection of hard alcohol and beers on tap.  The beers are also cheap (or maybe $3 a pint is standard for Madison).    For entertainment, there are pool tables, some arcade games, foosball and these really lame electronic dart boards.  The music selection is pretty sub-par, but I'd put up with it for the cheap beers.   It was pretty empty both nights that I went, though it was Sunday and Monday night of finals week so it might be more crowded on other nights.  The bartenders were nice and let us stay past closing to finish our pool game."}
{"text":"Totally a college scene. Crowded, fun dancing, next to qdoba to satisfy your late night drinking munchies. The shots menu is posted on the wall over their bar so you can see what goes into the delicious shooters (note-- you have to order at least 2). Music was not bad when I went on a Saturday night.   Don't wear anything too nice, as someone will probably spill a drink or two on you."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Madison! A little on the pricey side but the mechanical bull is free and the dance floor is always a blast."}
{"text":"Despite being a hangout for the drunk and the disastrous, Whiskey Jack is a pretty solid place to grab a drink. As a young, female, college student, it's fun to head to a bar where there's a dance floor and where there's also a place to sit and hang out. The bar is pretty standard, and the staff is pretty normal, so it's a good place to go for cheap drinks and dancing."}
{"text":"They have to water down their drinks!!! I've been several times and always leave more sober than when I walked in. So if you like over priced water this is the place to be! It literally smells from the stench of nasty men who will try to make out with you on the dance floor. Seriously, men try to stick their tongue in my mouth every single time. They come up behind me on the dance floor. Go anywhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Hey, wow- I was downtown yesterday and walked by this place. Ouch. Still a shithole where morons congregate. The shitty music blaring out onto the sidewalk, and the greasy, simian dudebros inside managed to offend me, and I didn't even set foot inside. Seriously: auditory, visual, and olfactory (the wave of Axe, B.O. and cigarette smoke hit me and I wanted to vomit) nastiness, all in one bar. Add to that the latest aggressive spam campaign here on Yelp (the staff are 'hot'? Really? How disgusting! I wonder how your 'staff' feels about being objectified so blatantly?), and you've got Whiskey Jack-Shit or whatever it's called now. Seriously, y'all- give it up. Your bar SUCKS."}
{"text":"The staff was very rude. They announced last call at 1:30 am. However, when I specifically asked what time they closed, the bouncer and bartender said 2 am. I continued to finish my drink, assuming we would be able to stay until closing time and finish our dart game. Instead, we were asked to leave at 1:40 am. I was mid-sip when the bouncer crushed my beer and spilled it on my new shirt. I was denied a refund."}
{"text":"Was walking home tonight and saw the most disgusting act of brutality that I have ever witnessed outside of this bar.  Kid walks up to the place. Bouncer attempts to take his I.D. Kid tries to grab it out of his hands.  Bouncer then gets the kid in a full nelson. Kid struggles. Eventually, the kid is subdued, is apologizing, and asking to be let go. At this point, the kid is being completely submissive and the bouncer could have grabbed his I.D. at absolutely any point.  It doesn't stop there. Eventually, there were THREE bouncers just \"roughing him up\". For absolutely no reason at all. Again, I say they could have retrieved his I.D. at any point. They proceeded to pick him up BY HIS ARMS while they were behind his back, and drop him onto the concrete. They smashed his head into the concrete multiple times. The kid was bleeding out his nose and head. He was barely conscious at points.  Eventually, the crowd stepped in and managed to get the bouncers off of him and the kid ran for his life.  If you happen to be walking by tomorrow morning, you can see the blood stains on the ground it was that bad. Let's just hope that kid didn't die of a concussion before retrieving medical attention!"}

{"text":"In the location of what was once the terrible \"Pub\" on state street, some entrepreneurial gentlemen created a fantastic new bar.  I'm actually amazed that no one has reviewed this yet, despite the fact that it's still fairly new.    I was really blown away by how good a bar this is, and part of that is due to the fact that it's something Madison has been missing for a long time.  Chicago and Milwaukee both have these niche bars that provide quality live bands, lights, atmosphere, and good drinks while at the same time garnering a happy medium of customers to occupancy limits.  Madison, on the other hand, has some nice bars but not anything like this.  They don't have good clubs (none I would even consider a club because Scatz doesn't count), and they don't have bars that are inbetween.  This is precisely what Whiskey River Saloon is.  They kick things off right by having an actual \"Wild West Atmosphere\" that is created by the customers and not forced by some sort of corporate campaign.  I walked in (after waiting in line for 20 min) and was treated to laughing, hooting and hollering, and a band that was playing fantastic music to a small throng of Friday night party-goers.  One of the best parts of the place is the space; there's a lot of room to move around despite the crowds, there's a numerous amount of tables setup for groups (and in good locations that are not in the way), and there's a long bar for when it gets crowded.  The best part is easily the stage though.  It's to the far back of the bar and takes up most of the back wall.  The band that night was playing classic hits from Sublime, Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, and others who while normally have subdued music they covered it in a way that really got the crowd engaged (even singing along), and the light show helped accentuate the atmosphere.  Part of the hype may be due to it being new and some good advertising, but I know that this bar is going to have no trouble staying afloat if they keep doing what they're doing.  My group also had obtained a beer tube complete with a tap which was a nice way to avoid being at the bar forever waiting for a drink (even though the bartenders were fun), and they seemed to all be enjoying themselves.  The only true drawback was the line at the door (which I waited in twice after forgetting my wallet), but honestly I'd wait in it again and again for a good experience like the one I had.    Couldn't recommend more, so glad the Pub is gone."}
