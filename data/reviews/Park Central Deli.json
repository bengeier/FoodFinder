{"text":"One if the client guys took me here for lunch.
The pastrami sandwich does taste great in the special bun. The beef is juicy and tender. The fries are supper crispy as well.
The only downside is the sandwich with fries with a regular drive cost almost $12. That's bit too much for lunch."}
{"text":"Meh... 


That's all I really thought while I ate my chicken fajita sandwich.

It wasn't bad by any means...

For a $13 lunch, I wasn't impressed.

I liked the inside of the place, it looked fun to be in. There is a large selection of things to get but it's just one of those places that feel like I got kinda ripped off. I could go to Sacks down the street and get an amazing chicken fajita sandwich for a couple bucks less. 

I like to give places the benefit of the doubt and maybe what I got was not there best, so I shall return in the future and hit up the other grill that has burgers. 

Extra star for the dude walking around with a bowl of candy. That was cool."}
{"text":"Great Deli. I had the \"New Yorker\" which consists of pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing on an AMAZING onion Roll. Would go back just for the roll! Everything that I had was great but the prices are high ($8-9 for a lunch plus the drink)."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  A \"deli\" that serves slightly less than mediocre food should at least try to make up for it in customer service and ambiance.  The surroundings are nice, equipped with an outdoor patio and koi pond.  However, the customer services seriously lacks.  The three employees we dealt with had bad attitudes.  It was like they were put out by having to do their job or answer a simple question like where the soda fountain is.  I had a philly cheesesteak sandwich and my friend had pastrami/ sauerkraut in rye.  Both sandwiches were less than mediocre.  The rye bread for the pastrami was stale and seemed low quality. Both meats were flavorless and greasy.   There are FAR better delis in the area.  We won't be returning as well as anyone from our office."}
{"text":"Don't wast your money.  This place is horrible.  I have given it several chances over the years and have been disappointed every time.  I paid over 13 dollars for a so called Brisket Sandwich and a drink.  The Brisket sandwich was served without BBQ sauce which in my book makes it not qualify as a brisket sandwich.  The service was completely rude.  I really don't understand how this place stays in business.  I have had better food and service in an elementary school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated. Always looking for family owned businesses to support. This deli has been around for a long time. Great pastrami sandwiches. A real N.Y. style deli. Friendly staff, priced reasonably for the large amount of food you get. Worth the trip to central phoenix."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like it, but I've eaten there several times and enjoyed everything I've gotten. The straw is good, the new yorker is great, and my favorite is the brisket on sourdough with swiss. The chili is also good, and I hear great things about the burgers. 

I agree with Jim W. - fast and quality

(this is not a date place)"}
{"text":"If you are in the downtown area and need a quick lunch or a good sandwich this would be the place to go.. Walking in it kind of has a half cafeteria half restaurant feel. Inside it is huge, allowing it to handle big crowds and when you order you make your way down the guide rails and watch them make your food. There are tons of choices and tons of seating.  They also have a relaxing patio. 

Food was good, I got the hot pastrami sandwich on french with provolone. So good, traveling to New York and Boston I've had some amazing hot pastrami sandwiches, living here not many places offer it hot so finding this place was awesome. My friend got the New Yorker, which is pastrami and slaw sandwich, which he loved. 

For sides, I got fries, I love fries and I wasn't a huge fan, you can tell they were frozen (bad sign), my friend got the pasta salad and he said it was pretty good. 

Other good points, they serve breakfast, they deliver and they allow call in orders and ask what time do you want it ready and instead of telling you what time to come. They have beer, wine and a bunch of other drink options. 

Bad points, say no to the fries, traffic on central is horrible because of the light rail (I was trying to make a left and couldn't because a ROW of four cars coming the other way were all trying to make a left at the same time! What the hell?), and they are only open to 7pm.."}
{"text":"Come here for the pastrami or corned beef.  They are the best in Phoenix.

They serve other food, but the pastrami is the star of this place.  The meat is warm and tender and it is perfect with sauerkraut & Swiss cheese.

Me and my co-workers go here at least once a week, and I have tried other things on their menu, but sad to say they are only average.

So if you want if you want the best pastrami or corned beef, come here, otherwise find another place."}
{"text":"Go for breakfast, they have very good pancakes and omlet. Never very go their for lunch."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the straw sandwich,  it is the bomb. I do not make it to uptown vary often but when I do I make sure I schedule it around lunch time, so I can fill up on this gem."}
{"text":"Native Phoenician here and I remember well this MM in its heyday. I keep trying to rekindle the magic that once was; I love you, long lost New Yorker and Straw. It is not meant to be. $16 for a sawdust bun and bone-dry pastrami is not gonna happen to me again. And those fries, Wow! (With a slathering of sarcasm.)

Too bad the quality had to suffer. I'd gladly pay $20 to have the real deal again."}
{"text":"man this is hard to do I have been coming here for years the last time the food was not very good I allways get the pastrami sandwich thought it may of been a off day so tried it again today not good at all the onion roll was dried out and the pastrami just did not have the flavor that I have always known the worst part was the service all the people had very bad attitudes and where just rude won't ever come back very sad"}
{"text":"Quick, fast, convenient, decent.  Not a destination though.

The corned beef sandwich was very good, though the sandwich bread was very thin and floppy (despite being toasted), your typical off-the-shelf grocery store bread.  The French fries were nice and hot, with a good crispiness to them.

I ate on the patio next to the fountain, which was nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly sandwhich. The bread is aweful, very processed meat and tasteless recipe. Fruit side dish was ok but that said it's hard to screw up fruit. 
I haven't tried other dishes here but so far no impressed and won't use them for any catering."}
{"text":"i work really close to this place, so it's ultra convenient. but i reserve it in case of emergency only. 

the veggie sandwich i first receive was the topping for a burger: lettuce, tomato and onion on bread. that was it. i realized this before paying and asked for some extra veggies, a slice of cheese and some mustard. talk about not delish. but it filled the hole.

they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill. grilled sandwiches, smaller portions and cheaper prices. i got the caprese: mozzerella, pesto and tomato on baguette, grilled. usually simple and good. this time? not so much. meh."}
{"text":"I consider Park Central Deli somewhere I come to when I want a treat. I've been coming to this location since it was still Miracle Mile, and honestly I think they have only gotten better since they opened without the MM name. The food is always fresh and well prepared, they work diligently to keep it clean, and the staff are all very welcoming and friendly. 

My favorite menu item is something you can't seem to find many other places - BBQ pastrami. The only other place that serves it is their predecessor, Miracle Mile. However, MM's is not as good. Here at PCD, the is chopped quite thoroughly and slow simmered in the sauce. At MM, I've had some really bad versions of the sandwich. 

Give them a try, they will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years.  I have pretty much eaten corned beef or pastrami.  I always get cottage cheese as a side.  I have never been to new York so I can not comment about how close it is to their stuff.  I know one thing.  I like their sandwiches here and recommend this place to others.  I have never had a bad sandwich here.  They have all been really good."}
{"text":"Nice variety of selections. Decent prices. Always a good portion. Ingredients could be higher quality."}
{"text":"The burger patties are a little crumbly but overall I like their food. I've had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese, the Chili Burger, and the Mac & Cheeseburger. All were pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I had their  chicken  soup for the first time . It was piping  hot birthday was flavorful.  Nice  portion. . Their best dish has to be their  pastrami  on an onion  roll  the pastrami is so fatty but so good . Best in town"}
{"text":"Quite a wonderful salad and HUGE! Great service with a smile even though we showed up 5 mins before closing!"}
{"text":"This place is weak! I've heard of and seen this place before ,was in area stopped for a sandwich today, worst people working there seriously rude! I paid 17 bucks for sandwich a side and two drinks for that price it's should be good and have great service, I was blown away bye how basically mean the people were and the sandwiches were totally regular nothing special I watched the guys basically throw my sandwich together with distain he even had to make it! I will never go there again and will tell everyone I know ,the place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the BLT. If you want a BLT in the area, go to Cut Above Cafe down the street. This place is over priced for the quality of food you get. 

You should be able to get a decent sandwich at a deli. This place honestly shouldn't even call themselves a deli."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  If you're going to pay over 10 bucks for a meal consisting of a sandwich, fries, and a drink, it better have actual table service.  This place is a cafeteria style establishment which serves inferior versions of all your favorite deli sandwiches.  I've eaten at this place for lack of alternatives within walking distance of where I worked, but eventually decided that as far as overpriced sandwiches are concerned, Duck and Decanter across the street is a notch above this."}
{"text":"Nasty ......,

While the food server is making my Philly sandwich with gloves on he turns around and grabs a mop and starts mopping the floor then goes back to making my sandwich. 
Just because you have gloves on doesn't mean you're okay with making peoples food after touching a mop. I just didn't eat the bread he had touched with the same gloves he touch the mop with.
The employees need to be retrained on food handling skills. 
I also asked a very simple question 
\"does the sandwich come with fries\" the food server said yes. I get up to the cash register and she charges me for them.
I ask her she says no they're extra.
I guess they need to listening skills as well.


Never Again Will I eat here"}
{"text":"I probably won't eat at this establishment again, the prices aren't horrible, but I ordered chicken noodle soup which did not contain chicken, noodles and very little actual soup.  Mostly it consisted of 2 celery stalks and 2 HUGE carrots."}
{"text":"I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. I usually order from the Inner Grill (the counter on the east side of the restaurant) . . . the Mac-N-Cheese Burger with a premium side of Chili Cheese Fries . . . aw yeah! There is tons of seating--bring ya friends! It's nothin' fancy, but it's very satisfying."}
{"text":"Consistently good catered sandwiches, pasta salads, and pickles! A lunch time favorite."}
{"text":"A great deli with good food and service.

Park Central  is a great traditional deli with a large varied menu. Today we had the sloppy Joe and it was very good, as were the side dishes and desserts.  Our Sloppy Joe sandwiches were big, very big, and very flavourful  and Park Central  doesn't skimp on the meat. Even the children's  menu is a bargain. It's rare to find a deli where the food is good and still be able to satisfy my nephews craving for a grilled cheese sandwich. 

Deli staff comes around to see if you need a refill, napkins, or just to ask if you need your table cleared of dishes.  It is comon to see staff carrying food to tables for elderly patrons or mothers with small children.  What more can I say, good food, good  service.  A warm, friendly atmosphere where one feels like a valued customer."}
{"text":"This place is just disgusting. I had a veggie burger and my boyfriend had the New Yorker. Veggie patty tasted like I was eating toxic rubber. I'm pretty sure even Morningstar's most basic veggie patty tastes better than this place's. I had two bites and was done. Apparently, the New Yorker wasn't much better, as my boyfriend finished only half. Was starving, so settled for the french fries and pickle that came with my $10+ meal. What a waste. $20+ dollars down the drain.

This was my second time here. First time was just as much of a disappointment. Coming back wasn't my idea. My elementary school's cafeteria food was better. 

This is where sad state/county workers (like myself) come to die. I guarantee you will if you eat here often enough. :o("}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and say no. I work close by and often get hungry after I'm done with shift at 3pm. It was a cold and rainy day and I was craving something tasty and hot. The Deli is behind Starbucks and has been there for years. It's a bit hidden but the space is kinda nice. 
It was very quiet with only two guests. Mid afternoon it was not a surprise. Service was friendly and efficient and after looking at the menu I knew what I wanted when I arrived at the counter. Philly Cheese Steak. To Go.
I figured a quick beer while I waited, and the cook asked if I wanted fries. I didn't but I relented and agreed. A Heineken and $14 and change. I gathered napkins and a few condiments and headed to the light rail. While I waited for the train I was very hungry and had snuck some fries on the way. Hmm, seasoned fries. Prefab frozen type, likely US Foods or Sysco.

That's where the joy ended.
As I sat and attempted to pick up half of the sandwich, the bottom was already soaked through and soggy, naturally falling apart as I brought it to my mouth. One bite and I nearly gagged. It tasted like dog food. It was beef, I think with overcooked chunks of onion and green pepper and a slice of cheese on top. It was gross. It had some type of reddish sauce that was completely flavorless. My guess is that it was cooked monday, and then reheated daily all week until today, thursday and reconstituted as the moisture evaporated as it sat at a steam table. 
It was disgusting. I wouldn't feed it to my dogs. The best part were the frozen fries.
And of course the bellyache 20 minutes later that has lasted so far 4 and a half hours hasn't helped.

Don't waste your time or money. There are so many better choices in this city. The only saving grace was the friendly service. Whoever operates this place has clearly lost their passion for quality food."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! I ordered the chicken salad & was surprised when I got back to my office that it came with fries. More than enough food for a fair price. Service was quick & there were plenty of open seats if we would have ate in."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Fast service. Huge salads! I love this place!

I ordered \"it's all Greek to me\" salad with chicken for a total $9.19. This thing can easily feed two people. Very tasty even without dressing. It took less than 10 minutes from order to out the door. This is my go to place when downtown. It has a huge variety and it is done well. 

I highly recommend again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is always relatively clean, always packed at lunch. I wish I could say I loved this place, its so close.

I've eaten here 40+ times, not because it is the best but because it is right across the walk from my job.  The people behind the counter are friendly though over all don't speak very fluent english.

I think when ordering here you have to know what to order. A lot of the food is very heavy, the rolls for the sandwiches are always dry to me, I really like the open faced turkey sandwich (they only have it a few times a week) but its VERY heavy and a carb load to boot with mashed potatoes and stuffing with everything  covered in gravy. I never finish it, but hot turkey for lunch is amazing just mostly don't eat the sides.

Also for the quality of food they offer, I would think that the prices would be better, but I guess if its packed and so convenient that everyone is willing to pay, why not charge whatever you want?

I must say this, and this is the reason I would choose 3 stars over 2... The breakfast is amazing, I've tried a few different things and the one thing that I like the most (and am most picky about) is my eggs, and they have never been anything but perfect there and I like thier homefries in the morning."}
{"text":"Tried the Atkins plate, corned beef, cottage cheese.  The beef was good. Fine Deli cottage cheese. A bit expensive."}
{"text":"funny I have yet to review this place considering I eat here at least once a week. 

I love the food. The Straw sandwich is one of my faves. It's pastrami or corned beef with cole slaw and kraut on a bread of your choosing. 

Everyday they have a daily special. Tuesdays are a good day as the specials are turkey with all the trimmings or meatloaf. The meatloaf is very tasty. The last time I ordered it I thought the mashed potatoes that came with it were a bit too whippped up. I like my potatoes slightly lumpy.

This place is usually packed around lunch time, so beware as the lines can be long, but usually go fast.

 I have been here for breakfast and dinner and those are the less busy times. It can almost be a ghost town around those times.

I recommened breakfast here as it's very good and affordable. Where I think their prices for lunch and dinner are a bit much, breakfast is pretty cheap and you get a decent amount of food."}
{"text":"Just when I thought Phoenix couldn't get any more awesome, I run into this place by happenstance. A real deli that offers as many meat and bread combinations as I can conjure up? I'll accept that challenge.

So after looking over all the options on the menu, I was firmly convinced that I wanted everything... then reality set in. I ordered the combo specialty sandwich(Hot Pastrami and corned beef) on an onion roll. It was spectacular. The bread was soft and the meat was abundant, wonderfully flavored,and perfectly heated. This is my new go-to deli in the valley."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was atrocious. It was worse than bar food. I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Pretty much paid $9 for a diet coke and I'm still hungry and have to find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Park Central Mall tends to consist of a swarming mass of people Monday through Friday during the lunch rush. Park Central Deli seems to be one of the major draws for nearby execs on a tight schedule, but I personally don't see the draw.

The interior is enormous. There is enough seating for a massive amount of patrons. A metal guide rail is in place directly in front of the order counter. Now, I'm not the smallest guy around but I'm definitely not the biggest either. Making my way down the counter along the guide rails left me feeling a little claustrophobic. After placing your order, you can see the crew directly behind the counter as they slice fresh cuts of pastrami, corned beef and barbecue beef. Watch them prepare your sandwich before your eyes, pile on the french fries (and a pickle). 

The cooks move fast. I've dined here during the week and I felt like a mouse being guided through a maze. If time is of the essence during your work week then this may be a good option. The price for a sandwich and fries was a little steep, however. It tasted alright, but even as I write this I can still feel it sitting like a brick in my stomach. If you have a sensitive digestive tract, this may not be the place for you. Pastrami and corned beef are fairly fatty and you'll pay the price... all day. Come prepared with some Tums.

Breakfast is served in the early hours of the day and catering is available for any events you may be heading up."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. Got the beef brisket sandwich with provolone on onion potato bun with fries and a soda. The beef was super tender and juicy and the fries were some of the best I've ever had (they're battered and very crispy). 
The downfall is that this is somewhat of a cafeteria environment (noisy and you stand in line to get your food) and they still charge nearly $12 for a sandwich, side, and soda. I was also not asked to pick my side - I wanted soup - but they threw the fries on there without asking. While the food was delicious, it was overpriced with mediocre service. I might go back but it's unlikely."}
{"text":"The diversity of food is quite good, but the quality of all the meals across the spectrum are all very good. There is something for everyone no matter how picky your palette or size of party."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice place to relax and unwind for a lunch break? This is the place busy but not loud. 

Pros - huge selection of food to try! 
Cons - either the food is too dry or there is not enough. Quality a 2"}
{"text":"My turkey sandwich on sourdough was very tasty. They serve 2% milk which is nice if you don't want a soda. A few outside patio tables and lots of inside seating."}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of pals last week for lunch here.  The Park Central Deli has a lot of memories for me, as I've been going there over 20 years, first with my grandparents growing up, as a regular lunch when I worked in the area when I got my first job and occasionally visits now.  Of course, I don't know it as the PCD, it will always be Miracle Mile to me.  I mean, the food is the same, the menu appears to be the same, and I swear that the lady working my register is the same lady who used to be there during the Miracle Mile days.  

I get the same thing about 90% of the time here.  Brisket on kaiser.  The quality can go up and down depending on the day (side note:  seems like the locations that kept the Miracle Mile name aren't as good on the brisket as this, one of the two original locations is), and this recent batch was pretty good.  (note 2:  I also make a mean non-bbq brisket, so I know of what I speak here).  The horseradish was nice and hot like usually, which gives a nice kick to the sandwich.  Only downside was that the fries seemed as if they weren't the freshest.  Overall a solid meal, just as I'd expect.

Due to the fries not being top quality, four stars on this visit, but whenever I have the chance, I try to stop in for the great grub and the nice memories."}
{"text":"Park Central Deli's pastrami is the best I have ever eaten!  Served thin-sliced as I like it, on a onion roll, the pastrami is flavorful and tender, with a peppery crust. I enjoy it served with crisp, tasty coleslaw and a salt water pickle.
This place is closing Nov. 17th as the owners are retiringI  I will miss this one-of-a kind deli.  Now I'll have to trek farther to the Miracle Mile deli which serves the same wonderful pastrami."}
{"text":"I came in for the second time last weekend and ordered the chicken salad sandwich on sourdough with a side of coleslaw. I really appreciate that they don't add a bunch of strange ingredients to their chicken salad, it was classic and tasty. The friends I came in with ordered a ham and turkey sandwich and both really enjoyed their choices as well. This place is a bit on the spendy end but you do get high quality food and plenty of it. This is definitely not a fancy or upscale deli but it does the job!"}
{"text":"Ok, I went back the very next day and ordered the brisket sandwich.  Again, the sight of that juicy meat stacked high in its bin was almost enough to make me hurt someone just for a taste.  No hurting needed, though.  I ordered and the service was top notch once again.  A little laughs this time, even.

The sammich is huge; stacked full of meat.  I knew I was in for a man's meal, so I piled up on the napkins...not needed.  To my surprise, as sloppy as this sandwich could have been, it stayed in order on the bun.  Of course a few scraps fell off, but I refrained from just plucking those into my mouth right away...I wanted the experience of the first bite of the sandwich.

It was....only ok.  MAN!!!  Darn it, I was hoping that it tasted as good as it looked and smelled.  But the brisket was simply not seasoned well enough.  Don't get me wrong, the juicy tenderness of it along with having just the right amount of fat (gotta love fat) made me scarf it down as though it were edible golden nuggets.  But each bite left something to be desired.

And again, the price was not too much fun for me.  I spent like $10 for a sandwich and fries.  A less-tasty-than-it-should-have-been sandwich at that.  

I will give this place another try, just because its so cool and the service is so good.  I really like their menu offerings, so maybe I'll find something worth the price."}
{"text":"Horrible. Rude service, little to no options for vegetarians, overpriced for portion size. Rock hard flavorless tomatoes, etc. My egg salad had shells in it. When I complained they looked at me like there was nothing wrong, no offer of a refund/replacement, just a shrug and \"oh\". Would not return, I always give restaurants a 2nd chance because mistakes do happen, but their complete lack of caring has resulted in a lost customer for life, they do not deserve a chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Pastrami is one of my favorites, and Park Central serves up my preferred pastrami sandwich in the central city area. Quality has dipped, as the meat seems to be of a lower quality these days, and honestly for the price they charge, you'd think they'd give you a bit more per sandwich. The line staff is kind (in English) but talks about some of the customers in Spanish quite loudly. I find it amusing, as I haven't heard anything about me yet. A good sandwich to be had. (when you can't make it to miracle mile)"}
{"text":"Excellent pastrami and corned beef. Great lunch spot. Lots of outdoor seating and they generally have something for everyone. Cute koi pond. Fast."}
{"text":"Despite the somewhat extravagant price ($12 and change per person!) and indifferent service, my coworker and I were suitably impressed with our sandwiches and the speed at which we were able to obtain them at the height of lunch hour. Bonus points for crushed ice, Cherry Coke and an air conditioned patio."}
{"text":"First timer. Came for lunch with coworkers. Cool place. Good food. I can't afford to eat here often, but would certainly come back if in the area. The kids would love the little fish pond out front."}

{"text":"The best deli in town. They're new Yorker sandwich is piled high with pastrami on an onion roll is outstandingly good.  The meat tender and tasty and the atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Park Central Deli is OK.  If you are expecting Kosher Style corned beef as you've had in cities back east you will be disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good corned beef.  But it's goyeshe corned beef.  Different thing.  

I had the straw, similar to a rueben.  Onion roll, grilled sauerkraut & swiss on the corned beef.  

Park Central has the feel of a big cafeteria but not in bad way.   The food is fast and quality.  I would definitely return for lunch if I were in the neighborhood.  They have lots of seating and a nice outdoor patio area with a Koi pond."}
{"text":"Park Central is a great deli with an excellent menu and good food.  Deli staff provide a warm, friendly atmosphere where one feels like a valued customer. These folks work really hard to earn business and provide value at a great price. I'm a repeat customer who enjoys this place."}
{"text":"Clean, nice atmosphere, its on the pricey side, everything costs extra. I ordered the turkey dinner. It was drenched in gravy, too consistent throughout, each bit was the same, average taste. My co-worker ordered the club sandwich, the ham portion was way too salty. She said it best when she stated, \"this tastes like hospital cafeteria food.\""}
{"text":"This is a big deli that knows how to get people fed at lunchtime. 

That's what they do and they do it well. 

People from the East Coast that I bring here for business lunches are uniformly impressed. It compares favorably with some of the more popular and venerable delis in Manhattan. 

The signature pastrami/brisket/bbq sandwiches are the main attraction, and are quite tasty. 

It's a good, very basic, proletarian eating establishment.

So that's what Park Central Deli does well.

What it doesn't do well is provide comfort to people with vegan/vegetarian diets. It also doesn't do well by people looking for affectations and decor, or a place to pose with various Apple products while wearing earth-tone turtlenecks and drinking expensive coffee. Don't come here if any of the above might be you.

This is not a hair salon. This is a barbershop. 

You go to Park Central Deli to eat, just like you go to a barbershop to get a haircut.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think this place used to be the Miracle Mile Deli? Anyway, as the Park Central Deli it hasn't changed much.

This is one of the busiest places in downtown Phoenix, and it is huge for a Deli. I had a great pastrami sandwich with \"straw\" (sauerkraut and cheese). They have a \"lite\" version with turkey too. I noticed they offer enchiladas, salads, and plenty of other options as well.

They have a nice patio area if you prefer to dine outside."}
{"text":"Overpriced cafeteria food. But hey, if they screw up your order they give you free cookies. LMAO!"}
{"text":"During 2-day meeting with a local company, we had to get a quick lunch so we walked out the office to a strip mall area that had Jersey Mike's, Starbucks, Thai restaurant, and this place.  Everyone was trying to decide to eat and most wanted Jimmy John's (which I am not a huge fan of!), but the manager picked this place.  SO GLAD HE DID!!

Place - It is a cafeteria style where you order from different stations.  I went straight to the hot sandwich area, but there are burgers, soups, entrees, and cold sandwiches to choose from.  They have a little covered patio, but it is Phoenix and I'm not a fan of the heat (dry heat or not, it still is over 100 degrees!).  

Food - I decided on the New Yorker ($11.49) that had both pastrami and corned beef with coleslaw and Russian dressing.  You get one side and I got the potato salad.  My co-worker got the mashed potatoes that had gravy on the bottom and top...should have gotten that :(   I recommend the onion roll that is freshly made and soaks up the juices.  The second day I was there, the team went to order Jersey Jim's but I went back to Park Central and got my mashed potatoes.  I changed it up and got brown gravy on bottom and white gravy on top :)  Decided on the Straw ($11.49) with more Pastrami and corned beef smothered with Swiss Cheese and their incredible Saurkraut on an Onion Roll. YUMMY!!

Drinks - They do serve beer, but I was working and got the Coke fountain drink.

Recommendation - This place is legit and worth stopping in for lunch.  Don't go to Jimmy John's and get one of these 2 sandwiches with the mashed potatoes (white and brown gravy).  Hope to have to make another trip to the site just to eat here!  

Downside - They DO NOT take AMEX (which most in my crew had as company cards)"}

Well. The sandwich. Ugh. And that's why I\"m there. Rye was dry. Pastrami was, um, well, what the hell ryhmes with pastrami. Um, oh, I know....pastrami was no a yummy...OK. I'm trying people. And the slaw. You know what I'm gonna say. The slaw...drum roll please.... WAS BLAH! As in bland. Not sweet. Not sour. Ugh.

Well it's in New York baby! What else do you need?

There's a surprisingly fabulous, modern patio at PCD. Seriously worth checking out for a \"mall\" establishment. I'll go back. Perhaps to try another deli delight. Or maybe to hurl my sandwich in the Koi pond. Even though the sign says not to feed the fish. HA! I'm de elited and a rebel biatches!!!!!

And maybe, just maybe, I'll wear my I HEART NY t shirt."}
{"text":"I could sum this place up in one sentence: \"Corned beef and pastrami on rye...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\"

That said, the people behind the counter are super-nice, pickles taste like my mom's (well better. Mom, hold the lighting bolt til I'm done writing, OK?) and fries that are made to order. Add the patio and the koi pond (which has beautiful fish) and you have the best deli outside of Chicago. 

Park Central Deli.....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Was quite surprised when I got back to work and there was about a tablespoon of mac n cheese in my container. The equivalent of two small bites! I paid $12 for a half sandwich, two bites of mac n cheese and a drink. Not happy! I was mostly looking forward to the mac m cheese!"}
{"text":"The Triple Decker with pastrami is pretty much my favorite thing ever. Even if the service and atmosphere were awful, which it's not, I would still totally come here for this sandwich. In fact I'm surprised crack dealers aren't selling this sandwich on the corner, because it's so good that I would buy it from them. I have visited some of New York's most famous deli's and so far have found nothing that even comes close."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place for many years but decided to give it a try a few weeks ago and since then I have been there multiple times.  The food is consistently good with large portions and the staff is wonderful!  They are generous with not only the food but also how they package your food when you order a to-go.  When I order their soup they always wrap it in a bag and a safety tie just to make sure it doesn't spill on my way back to the office :) The little touches that cost them money but will have me coming back meal after meal.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Classic Deli in downtown Phoenix, use to be a Miracle Mile when Park Central was a real mall. I order the Pastrami on Onion every time. It is so fresh and good you can't switch to anything else. They are quick to get you in and out for your lunch plus they always provide great service and generous portions. Never had a bad meal here. Better than getting a burger for lunch."}
