{"text":"Pros: The Original Burger, Roast  1/2 Chicken, Waiter service, Wi-Fi Cons: Host service  Parking space: Enough for all customers Good for big groups: Maybe  On a Good Friday, around 9:00 PM, the restaurant was almost full. But when we arrived there the hostess did not offer a place to us to sit at a first moment, we need to look for her and ask to sit on a table. But even with this, I liked the restaurant. The waiter service was a little slower than most of the other restaurants but he was a very nice and friendly person. He was always aware when my soda needed refill. The place seems a night point for the young people on the city and the music was played for a DJ and after for a band. What I can say, it was cool! I almost stand and went there to dance. This time, my wife and I asked for a The Original Burger and the Roast  1/2 Chicken. Both food presentations were very good and in a \"young\" way. Overall, it was a very nice experience. There was no dried part of the chicken and the chicken gravy was to dying for. And oh my God, the food was very exciting. Something to change? Nothing. Congratulations West50, me and my wife had a very nice time on your place and left the restaurant with the feeling that I want to go back again many many many more times."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers. Ok service."}
{"text":"This place was my late check-in salvation! I couldn't order food next door after a long flight and arrival after the hotel kitchen was closed (next door), and needed food and drink to comfort this weary traveller.    Hidden away on the second floor, once I found the lounge service was quick and helpful.  The whiskey sour was perfect, and the grilled veg salad was delicious.  The spicy chickpeas were weird but good, getting their heat from Frank's hot sauce.  They do put that sh!t on everything!  I should have rounded up my group for drinks here instead of the hotel. Service was better and so was the whiskey sour."}
{"text":"As a restaurant this place is actually quite great. As a club it kinda sucks. Great beer selection but the overall experience of going here leaves some room for wanting. I'd recommend &Co over this place any day."}
{"text":"A few work colleagues and I were looking for a place to hang out and chose West50 because of its great location (it is easily accessible from either HWY 403 or the QEW). We weren't disappointed! We ordered six 6oz. samplers for under $20 and asked our server to provide her six recommendations. We also ordered three appetizers to split between us (onion rings, poutine, and fish tacos). Everything was delicious and the portions were just the right size for three people to share. I should also add that West50 has a great atmosphere too. It was warm, comfortable, inviting, and the music wasn't too loud which made it easy to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"The one star is for the fish tacos, which were truly groin-grabbingly transcendent (but then again, how can fish tacos ever be anything but?).  The service was just awful. Came in around 7:30 on a Friday and had to wait a good 30 minutes for a table (which ended up being in the farthest, most barren reaches of this soulless place). Apparently basic literacy is not in the qualifications section of a West 50 hostess's job description, but how difficult is it, really, to enter a phone number into a computer?  We had the privilege of experiencing the unadulturated joy of waiting for a server to grace us with her presence only after we had time to read the menu, front to back, an approximate total of 323 times. After waiting another decade for our food to arrive, we were transported to fish-taco heaven for a brief period. Sadly, our drinks did not arrive until well after we had shoveled the last glorious morsel of deliciousness down our respective gullets. Unfortunately the \"Razz-berry Mojito\" would make Fidel Castro himself vomit with rage. An abomination of the most weep-inducing sort. Perhaps if I had any interest in beer I would appreciate this place. A head injury would also be helpful for me to decide that going back to West 50 would be preferable to siting at home and eating Vaseline on toast."}
{"text":"I really like this pub but the food is not great and everytime I go there they have karaoke which is annoying. Ban the karoke and i would give this place a 4/5"}
{"text":"The main reason for going was for the beer on tap... But surprise! They no longer have beer on tap! The place was deserted and the food was horrible. Such a disappointment. Doesn't event deserve a full star."}
{"text":"Bring back the DRAFT BEER! This place used to rock because they had such a wide beer selection. Now all the taps are shutdown... going from 150 taps to 20 taps doesn't make this place special anymore.  IF you want to safe this place, make it BEER focused. Invite the breweries, have 3 course meals paired to the beers, have Oktoberfest Wednesdays, etc.. etc..."}
{"text":"New owners... No more beer on tap!? Can't speak for the food, but as far as nightlife goes there's little reason to come here. Saturday night the whole bar's empty and they're still charging cover. To top it all off they have no beer on tap...seriously no beer on tap, apparently new owners have taken the place over and put an end to the pour..."}
{"text":"This place used to be known for largest selection of draft beers in Mississauga....and they go right ahead and get rid of all draft beers. Never returning."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Food was terrible for everyone; the calamari was cold and stale, the steak was too salty, chicken wings were rubbery and they put meat in a quesadilla when my friend was a vegetarian. The $21 antipasto platter that I ordered was pretty cheap in quality; knew the cheese was stale as soon as I bit into it and the meat was just any other meat you can get at the deli for less than $5. Service was average and we had to wait over 40~ minutes for our food to come, despite the place not being busy at all. For the quality of food we got, it was vastly overpriced and we felt ripped off. Apparently they always include an 18% gratuity charge on your bill, which we felt we shouldn't have to pay and the card terminal had the nerve to ask for % tips on top of that, to which we of course chose \"no tip\". The place and atmosphere was pretty nice, though. Would not recommend for food at all and would never go back."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday evening, no cover and the place was packed. The bar is huge (40+ feet long) and only had one bartender so it took quite long to get served.   Appetizers were okay for the price. Dining area has large windows with an unremarkable view of the six-lane street. For smokers, there is an outdoor patio with heat lamps.  I recommend calling ahead for a reservation if you're going with a big group."}
{"text":"Come for the beer!  Do not stay for the food.  Over 50 beers on tap... I think that is their shtick?  They carry some good beers, from local to imported; you definitely will be able to find something that suits your tastes, and prices are reasonable.  The food however is just not good.  Way overpriced and sub par.  The menu is kind of like a steakhouse menu, with the prices to match, but the quality of the food just doesn't cut it.  My friend ordered a steak, asked for medium, and it was well done and not the best quality.  I had some chicken dish and the chicken was very dry.  Our appetizer was just so-so.  Your money here is definitely better spent on beer!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised no one has reviewed this place yet. This place is crowded as hell on Friday nights. This is one the restaurants owned by the same people as \"Ten\" in Port Credit and \"On the Curve\" in Mississauga city centre. The food is pretty good here, though a bit pricey for what it is. I do have to say that this one of the 2-3 spot in central Mississauga that I prefer to get tipsy at, so I don't usually eat here. After 10pm, they do charge cover, I believe it is $5. The bar area comes alive and you can dance the night away, there is music. This is one of the better places for the 20 something crowd to hangout at because \"On the Curve\" tends to be a little bit more mature in its clientele. Great selection of beers here, that's what they are known for and wines. They do have a good selection of mixed drinks as well. Overall two thumbs up from me. Btw they do have dress code, which is on their site, not too strict, but you can't look sloppy here."}
{"text":"I work in the building where this bar is located, so I've been there a few times.  Warning: if you want to have a meal - or even just a drink - here in under an hour, best to go elsewhere. It doesn't seem to matter which manager (and as I understand, there have been many) runs the place, service always seems to be at the very bottom of the list.   The food is serviceable, but nothing to write home to mother about. They used to be a \"pour house\", meaning they had tons of beer on tap, but for some reason have changed to what they call a \"martini bar\". If that was the case, you think they'd learn how to make an actual martini. I ordered a dry vodka martini (which means little vermouth) with a lemon twist (and I specified no olives) yet I was served a dirty martini (tons of vermouth) with three olives.  This place can be so sad sometimes that it's humorous. Mediocrity reigns supreme here."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, and each time it was after work, with a small group, for a pint and some food. Both times, the waitresses neglected to tell us that there are specials (half price apps), which would have been good to know. The Credit Ale was pretty  cheap here the first time I went (about $4.50/pint), but when I ordered that the second time, it was over $6. Not a big deal, but it doesn't seem like the price would go up so much within a two week period. If I had noticed right away, I would have asked about it, but oh well..."}
{"text":"Attended on a Saturday evening without a reservation, and got a table after a short wait.  The crowd is young and boisterous, with several birthday parties.  Not a place to go for a quiet dinner, at least not on Saturday night.  Service: Attentive, if a bit clumsy.  We were asked for drink orders before we had finished taking off our coats, and utensils were dropped onto the table and floors on multiple occasions.  However, the servers were responsive and friendly.  Food: Uniformly mediocre.  The breading on the calamari was soggy.  Alfredo sauce on the pasta was claggy, clumpy, not smooth and not appetizing.  Prime rib wasn't trimmed and had huge chunks of fat, but the sauce was flavourful if a bit too salty.  Vegetables were well cooked.  Other: They don't call it a pourhouse for nothing.  The beer selection is monstrous, which can be both an asset and a hindrance.  Our seating area had huge windows affording a terrific view outside.  Good idea, but unfortunately, there is not much to see except the road.  Overall: Decidedly middle of the road.  Probably a good place to go if you treat it as a bar, and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"Always a hit with me and my friends. phenominal beer on tap, the most I've ever seen.  food is great...comfort pub food at its best"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. When the live music is there, its usually pretty impressive. Crowd is often young (19-23).  Went for dinner though.  Was a long-time regular previously, and really loved the food, beer, and everything about the place.  Calamari was mediocre.  Barely breaded.  Undercooked.   Beef Medallion dinner -- meat was plain.  Potatoes were scarce.  Vegetables were good.  Presentation looked nice to start, but the taste just lacked overall.   Meat Loaf dinner -- very good.  Plating was mediocre, but the taste was great.   Warm S'mores Brownie -- nothing tasted like it was done in the restaurant.  Was more of a cake, than a brownie.  Light, and fluffy, without the dense brownie taste.    The value wasn't there at all.  Go for the drinks.  Stick to the Onion Rings for a snack.  I still love the place itself, but seems like I'm not the only one to feel the food isn't what it was."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for an early dinner.   I had never been here before for food , so I was curious to check out the menu. Average.  I couldn't help but notice the crowd was well over 30+yrs. It's tons of older men dining here.   The staff is polite and friendly. Apparently you don't wait to be seated, you just walk right in. The upper level have tall booths that look quite spacious and private. The lower level has a sun room type of feel with tall glass windows, perfect for sunny days.   order:  veggie spring rolls - myeh.. I'm a tad biased since I've had it better in cheaper places. The difference is in the pudding. There's corn, bean sprouts and clear noodle type strings. This changed the taste completely.  veggie penne pasta - Possibly the smallest pasta portion ever! regular beef burger with onion rings - burger was 5/10. Onion rings 4/10.   The best thing about this place?  Ask for something called the 6pack. They give you shot glasses of 6 diff types of beer, Any 6 you want.  They were out of strawberry fruili beer (sad times) BUT they had stiegl grapefruit radler (AWESOME).  This was an awesome feature!... I got to try the crooked canoe (tastes like tequila?? (what the?) , paulsner (too heavy) .   Total was $64.00 for 2.   There's better places for dinner, but I would come back just for the 6pack deal ;)  xoxo M.    Note: if your super hungry, don't come here. The portions are SO tiny."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing, also confusing.  I was looking for a brown ale that is not too stout.  Tried 3 kinds and did not find it.  All three were good though.  Strong, intense, flavorful.  I ordered the lamb wrap and it was good.  Very tender and thinly sliced lamb wrapped with some vegetables.  It was drippingly good.  The crowd was rowdy with Stanley cup going.  That's actually fun to be caught with the excitement.  It also made conversation difficult.  Good thing beers kept us well lubricated.  Very lovely waitresses."}
{"text":"Having read on the West 50 website that they closed due to \"emergency maintenance\", and now having learned that they appear to be closed permanently, I can't say I'm surprised. On the two occasions I visited, I found the experience to be lacking overall.  The myriad selection of beers was the main claim to fame for the restaurant, which is/was located on an upper terrace (and accessed through a nearby building) in the Sussex Centre, but it didn't really do anything that great that other pubs haven't already tried. You can go to virtually any pub (like the Crooked Cue in Port Credit, for instance) and get a selection of 50-60 different beers without the pretentiousness.  The second time my friends and I went, about two months ago, we called ahead to reserve a table thinking that it would be packed. We were told that there were plenty of spots available, but when we arrived 15 minutes later, I was told that all the tables were filled, and the waitress seemed to be dismissive of me (I'm thinking she looked at my friends and thought we were too rowdy?). When I looked into the restaurant, it looked barren, oppressive and half the tables were empty. Not wanting to bother with the waitress' pretentiousness, we left and ended up going to the Tilted Kilt down the street.  Probably a good thing that they closed down. They seemed to lose a lot of respect in the eyes of customers, if the other recent reviews are any indication."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday evening with a large crowd of 20 people for a dinner party. First note: after 9 or 10 pm, the music turns up and makes it very difficult to converse or hear the people around you without straining your voice and ears. Better place for loud parties, drinks, and dancing. If your plan is to catch up with friends or have a more toned down night over dinner I'd recommend a different place, particularly over the weekends.   Food was not disappointing, although I did not find it remarkably impressive either. The beer/drinks are better worth the money despite falling on the pricier side. Service ranged for us, depending on the waiter/waitress that night, from okay to poor. Ours was obviously in a poor mood that night and was fairly unprofessional about it, evident in the manner our orders were taken. One request also had me waiting for nearly half an hour, which was initially forgivable for how busy it was, but not when I was snapped at in a rude tone for requesting it a second time. Perhaps service is just a hit or miss here, as it seems others have had more positive experiences.  Decor-wise, there's ample space for dancing and mingling. A nice floor spans out around the bar for this purpose. The live music was also enjoyable, although it was slightly at the expense of my ear drums. Once again, good place for a party looking towards a loud night of drinks and dancing, but not so much otherwise."}
{"text":"Its fine for the ambience . They have a live band and a small dance floor. A huge bar area and a dining area. The food is pricey and small portions imo. I would suggest to just go try their beers since they have like 100 different kinds. Try the 6 pack wihch lets you taste 6 beers (6 oz)  for 18.25 . Other than that i wouldnt suggest eating here."}
{"text":"this place is amazing.  150 beers on tap all year  long!    I went to this place with one of my mate's.  He literally lives down the street, so it wasn't difficult to stumble out of there.  We skipped on the food to overdose on the brew.  I strongly recommend paying a visit to this diamond."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in the GTA -BAR none! With more than 115 beers on tap, you could bring friends together and play Century club and still not be done. During my visit I got to take a tour of the keg room. WOW. Take it from me when I tell you that this room is every frat boys wet dream, wall to wall kegs, pressure gauges and hoses galore - It was like the candy room in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory except with Beer!!  Interesting point for the pint purist, I learned that West 50 flushes the lines each time a keg runs dry. Most places will flush a keg line 1 or 2 times a month. this ensures that the beer you receive is always fresh and tastes the way it is supposed to.  They also have a passport booklet (see pic) called the West 50 Club, where with each milestone of 10, 25, 50, or 75 20oz drafts you reach you receive a prize and your name gets entered for a chance to win a trip to germany. If you finish the booklet you get your name inscribed on this Stanley Cup looking Keg. Think its impossible? They have a regular who has completed the list 19 times!! To rephrase the dos equis guy - \"GET thirsty my friends\"  As I waited for my lunch to arrive I decided to start my beerly quest for the cup and quickly downed 2 pints 1) a Grimbergen Dubbel (Belgium) and 2) The Pedavena Pilsner (Italy). Both blew my mind and I'm fairly certain I may never again settle for a run of the mill domestic again.  For lunch I had the Bourbon Street Penne - a sweet and spicy tomato based sauce, with shrimp, chicken and andoulli sausage. I know previous reviews mentioned the smaller portion size but honest this was super fllling. How much food are you actually looking to eat? Portion size was perfect (and I am a hefty eater). Delicious!  The staff here is very friendly and extremely knowledgable about all things beer. While the the decor is extremely versatile - professional enough for a business lunch/dinner or corporate party but is also casual enough with the stainless steel bar and 115+ beers on display and flat screen televisions that this could easily become my new fav place to come watch a game :)  The patio is interestingly placed and you must walk through it to enter from Burnhamthorpe, but its a great size and I can see myself enjoying many a pint (perhaps 115 of them) out there.  I shall return and I will bring thirsty friends time and time again. Big thanks to Chef Brendan for the hospitality and the staff for the great beer reccos. 2 beers down 110 to go  *** One additional edit, in case you needed additional incentive to visit and stay for   a few beers, they have free wifi for the beer friendly business man***"}
{"text":"Been here in the past enjoyed the food, drinks and dancing... With that in mind I .planned a dinner and dancing night with a 8 of my girlfriends...we had reservations and were brought to our table, given time to sit and were asked for drinks...the waitress started off attentive and friendly but when asked about various cocktails, Martinis she seemed annoyed, not just recommending her drink choices but practically pushing them on us.  Drinks came very late, ordered apps ...one guest asked for suggestions and took a minute to decide...wait staff rolled her eyes and made a huffing sound!  Apps finally show up, not great but when you are hungry..you eat!!!  Ordered our dinners, drinks etc....finally had to approach the waitstaff to get our drinks as she forgot! Dinner was bland and overpriced per portions.   Waitstaff seemed to get ruder and in attentive as the night went on...practically forgot about us was not seem for 1/2 hour after ordering drinks so a guest in my party ordered from the bar...suddenly wait staff appears furious and YELLED at my guest for ordering from a bar and not waiting for her   After this point her behaviour was beyond rude we asked for our bills so we could order straight from the bar.  Bills were mixed up and one bill forgotten which was also our fault apparently. Horrible service from this woman!!  Other than that, the live band was alright throughout dinner but I feel the DJ should have had more time for the dance floor and not had to keep rotating with the band.  Dance floor needs to be a bit bigger! Only good thing about this night were the drinks that we did actually receive and the company I was with, otherwise total FAIL.  None of us plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Still sitting at our table attempting to get the attention of our waitress... That being said, service tonight was the highlight of the night. The entire place is dead for a Friday night and music selection has had no direction. Food quality was your usually bar/pub fare. This place has lost all its former sophistication and attitude. Lots of better places in this area to check out. Only giving it 3 stars because of the nostalgia attached to this place."}
{"text":"Great short ribs. Ok service.  I went with some friends who were regulars who raved about the food and I'll admit it was good!  My short ribs plate seemed...short compared to the dishes my friends got but it was amazing.  I had to savour every bite and vs my normal military principles of \"get'er done\" or \"leave no morsel standing\" I actually enjoyed every bite.  The portion was perfect because being a great dish I devoured it but wasnt left with the often after effect of feeling stuffed and I'll...this time I was satisfied, which only complemented the chef on his/her excellent control of flavones and portions.  My only reason for not hitting my first 5 star here was because of the service...even though my friends were regulars the waitress forgot our drinks...it's ok to do that but not 1) on a slow day (a Tuesday where half the bar was full) 2) we were the only ones in our area so not like the section was too busy to handle 3) my friends were regulars who knew the kitchen staff even...no excuse in my books to miss their orders...mine maybe but definitely not theirs.  But I look forward to going back there...with the right service ( my friends assured me it normally is much better on the drinks serving front) this could be my first 5."}
{"text":"so many beers on tap it's awesome. Their dinner menu is quite good, reasonable priced and so far haven't had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night with my friend and there was a $5 cover. Seemed like there was a mixed crowd of all types of people, young and old, which was nice. I have been here before aswell and was never disappointed mainly because of the beer :) There was a live band and a DJ that we were jammin to, in this upbeat environment. My friend and I decided to sit near the bar in a booth and the seats were vibrating from the bass... it felt like a massage chair, I ain't complainin'! I ended up grabbing a Erdinger and Delerium beer and I loved both. I had a side of chicken wings and they werent too bad but for some odd reason, the carrot and celery tasted better. You would probably never hear that from me but its true... lol Our server was very nice and friendly and checked up on us when it started to get really busy. Also, there were flyers of latin nights on wednesday, seems quite interesting! I would love to come back and try more stuff on the menu and especially the beers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. My sister and I are/were in the restaurant industry and we're pretty shocked on how things turned out for this place. The variety of beers is gone, we were never approached by a server to get our orders; I had to get up and give my order at the bar. Oh and did I mention, the bartender didn't ID my sister coz she clearly looks pretty young (she's 19). They gave us the regular menus instead of the late night menu, so that busted my hunger bubble. I may sound like those snooty guests, but something as courteous as approaching the table would have made things better. This place had better days"}
{"text":"Hey again,  Came here for some food and mainly beers.  I enjoyed the beer selection.  Takes a long time if you do not know what your looking for.  Exceptional list of beers.  The waitress was friendly and was helpful in choosing a beer.    I had the fish and chips for dinner.  It was average, nothing terrible.    The ambience is well ....dated.  They boast about the Tv's and the quantity of them.  They are rather old and some even are showing loss of picture quality.    I will go back and try food again.  Stay for the beers."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. And definitely great beer.   I still don't understand why this place turns into a nightclub after 9:30 on the weekends (just does not have the space/environment for it) but its a great place to relax with a pint after work or for a nice lunch after a day of shopping.   If you're a real beer lover, join the West  50 Club to earn prizes, try new beers and get invited to members-only events. It's free to join.   The staff are friendly and the owner is always there ready to serve you.   All around an awesome place to leave your money lol"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, great selection of beer ofc, but small portions, overpriced and parkings a pain. I really enjoyed their Stuffed Chicken although, I would probably not go back just for that."}
{"text":"I came here for a pint and some wings for lunch and this place did not disappoint. They had a great selection of beers on tap and the wings were pretty big and cooked perfectly. They were a bit on the salty side, and the sauce was basically Frank's Red Hot (tasty, but boring and standard).   Service was friendly and I had a nice spot by the window, watching the traffic go by.  There's a pretty sweet patio there, too."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the restaurant as I visited on a Friday evening when the restaurant is converted in to a sports bar/club/lounge - kind of a hybrid of all three.  It's hard to find - you have to enter through the main floor of a business/shopping concourse and search for an escalator to the second floor. There's no signage indicating where the entrance to the bar is located - but if you follow your ears, the club music will lead the way.  $5.00 at the door, pretty standard cover charge considering the area. It's definitely a late-teen/early-twenties crowd here, sort of Jersey Shore meets Mississauga. If you're into that sort of thing.  The first thing that stands out is the beer selection on tap - over 100 domestic and import brands! This was probably the most impressive aspect of the establishment. There are also TV's everywhere you look in the bar area which is great during playoff season. Speaking of the bar, it can take a while to get served. Stick to beer - mixed drinks are weak and not worth the price.  There is a good sized patio, which in theory would be great. Unfortunately it's crowded with smokers and really unpleasant for anyone who appreciates pink lungs.  The music selection is predictable, nothing to really distinguish this from any other Top 40 bar. The '\"live\" dj wasn't spinning anything, just controlling the music from a computer. The live band was pretty hit and miss. Considering the young crowd, playing hits from the 80's probably wasn't the way to go (although I didn't mind). Once they'd succeeded in completely clearing the dance floor they were yanked in favor of more Top 40 and fist pumps.  This place is worth checking out for the beer selection alone, but doesn't really have a lot to offer beyond that."}
{"text":"5 stars for beer selection.  Only Bier Market can compete and even they don't have some of the selection here.  These beers are more focused on local rather than Belgium and Austrian.  Food is decent as well.  But if not for the beer, I wouldn't be bookmarking the place.  Fairly old building and could do with a makeover, but it's big and spacious with a bunch of seating with views out of large windows."}
{"text":"Lots of beer options. Enjoyed the live bands and food. On the weekend the place get a bit busy. Definitely a spot for girls night out."}
{"text":"I was never really a big fan of West 50 because I found their food to be pretty expensive and the crowd  full of seniors.   Just my luck my co-workers and I decided to go here on Wednesday. Honestly, I actually had fun. The crowd wasn't full of seniors so I guess I was dreaming about that. Kenny V was playing great music from different genres. It was a nice atmosphere. It was great sitting and enjoying a night out with my co-workers while grooving to Kenny V on the guitar.   I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Canada's largest drafted beer selection, 150+ beers on tap. Our waiter was very pumped up and excited about explaining to us how the placed worked and explaining different beers.    We didn't eat anything, but the table next to us was eating and it looked like some quality stuff classy stuff.  Not sure which beer to try?; buy a sampler tray for 13$ or so and get 6 - 5oz Beers."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing is rave about or come back to If it was my choice. Lots of beer selection, plus! They can make your average mixed drinks, good to know! Food - below average, I understand this turns into a lounge/club but even during normal hours the food was... Poor. Id have a better burger down the street from a diner. The price doesn't equal to the food quality.   They also want a cover charge .. I'm sorry this is Mississauga, the music isn't the best (it's live), the dance floor is little, and you can't really have a conversation either - decide west50 what are you? I wouldn't go back unless someone forced me to. I've been there for lunch and from dinner to closing, it's not my environment, it's uncomfortable being there as the place is confused as their customers."}
{"text":"If you're in the Mississauga area, a must stop for any tech professional.   I'll sum it up with two easy statements: 1. Awesome selection of beer on tap 2. Reliable free WiFi with good bandwidth  Enough said."}
{"text":"I have done my birthday here twice (because they have semi private and private rooms + they are willing to do separate bills off the main menu=D) Also get togethers, casual nights, going away parties.  The food here is along with the other Hip restaurants on the mark but pricey. I love their nachos/beef ribs is yummy but messy to eat. Their sangria is good, don't remember much else about it. They serve their beers in little boots 8 cute :D I got one of their Caesars YUM in a mason jar which was also kinda cute.  They have live music everything weekend and Thursdays, this is hit or miss as in every band has some good songs then non dancable songs. But there is a smaller dance floor right in front of the stage (don't stand too close to the speakers or you won't be able to get rid of the ringing noise afterwards). The beer selection is also really good, strawberry fruili being the only one some of my friends will touch lol  The decor overall is definitely nice and lots of wood and darker hues. There is a cover on fri/sat of $5-$10 after 9pm so get in their before the line up starts."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink, excel excellent draft beer collection."}
{"text":"Saturday night visits only!  Bar/restaurant/patio/club whichever combination you want to call it. West 50 has it all but not at its finest. It attracts the older crowd (typically 30+) very rarely you will see younger customers in the twenties.   Food isn't all that wonderful, but it is at a convenient  location in the downtown Mississauga.  Ive been here for dinners, club, and the b-day parties this is the best its going to get unless you are heading downtown Toronto. Food is good, don't get any pastas. Ive had good experiences with their nachos, burger, onion ring and fish. Those are the only ones I recommend.  Lots of space, and you can be as loud as you would want. Live bands are a plus for those who enjoy that kinda stuff... The bar is very large with lots of seating. Recommended for party goes who don't want to drive all the way downtown.   Service can be slow depending on traffic.  Parking is not free in the area so pay up or you will be ticketed."}
{"text":"Deplorable. If I  could give 0 stars, I would. Slimy lettuce.  Rubber ball chicken. Dirty tables and seats. snail like service."}
{"text":"This review only pertains to the bar as we came in on Friday night in an attempt to get our fun on.  $5.00 cover at the door. There was a band and dj, both okay. Nothing to write home about.   The crowd was YOUNG! My friends that were all at least five years younger than me felt old there. Lol! The place was only at about 1/2 of it's capacity I would guess, if that.  Drinks were on the expensive side, two beers and one rail drink came to $25! And the mixed drink was VERY weak.  This is not a place i plan to revisit on a weekend night but will try again for happy hour since it is close by and the patio is alright."}
{"text":"I love this place for the beers on tap and that is about it.   The ambiance is really dark! Not inviting at all. I don't mean oooo great date spot dark, I mean wow I can't see the person across from me's face.     It also didn't help that the food was subpar, I was expecting more from a place that has such a cool selection of fine beers from all over the world. It would be nice if they paired those beers well with an awesome edgy menu that was executed well. If they get new kitchen staff or revamp their menu, they'd have a winner here and not just a place you go to drink so darn good beer!"}
{"text":"Shitty service at the bar on a Saturday night. Smokey all the way through the bar. I would come back here if I wanted the days when u could smoke in the bar. U smell cigarettes from the moment u walk in the bar. Music is alright.  Very young crowd. Wear whatever u want at this place. No dress code. Ladies r plentiful for the guys. Awesome come as u r bar! Think I'll make this second time in 4 years my last time...buuuuuut I said that last time."}
{"text":"We as a group went there for lunch 3 times. None of the times left good impression. One time we waited for almost an hour for the food. Today, they messed up with our orders. They do compensate for all that afterwards but we were not pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't know this existed.  West 50 Pourhouse is located inside a business building and there isn't really a parking lot in front of it.  Lucky for you there is underground parking in the back and West 50 also validates!  I came here for drinks one day and wow, they got some drinks.  They have a giant selection of different beers and they all have a different star ranking (appropriate) for how expensive they are (basically 1 star to 5).  There's all sorts of beers from all countries and they're all draught, so feel free to take about 10 minutes to look over one page of names, because it definitely took me that long at least.  I also got the breakfasty burger there (no idea what it's called, it had pea meal bacon and egg on it).  The burger was pretty good, it wasn't the best, but I definitely didn't have a problem with it.  All in all, this place is set to be one of my favourite afterwork joints.  They have wing night on tuesdays and also DJs after-hours if you're into that sort of thing, but I personally will be back for beer alone."}
{"text":"Came here unexpectedly when Failtes Irish Pub was trying to hard to be something it was not... it's within walking distance and also is right near Square one for parking.   Had a group of 30 people and was accomodated on a Saturday night with no prior reservation. We got a table and were served all night, the staff were very friendly and we had a great time. Definitely will be back here.   Great atmosphere, great selection of beers, fun staff."}
{"text":"Love this place to pieces!  So casual - great in accomodating our peanut and treenut allergies, provided excellent service to our whole family including my little ones.  I am in love with the meatloaf - it is to die for must try this and try the specialty beers recommended!! My husband loves the steak.  I think the only thing that pains me is that they took off the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee (was a peanut/treenut free option) as a dessert - I would drive to this place just for this dessert.  Anyone with peanut/treenut allergies will not have dessert options but that's usually the case with food allergies like this.  Love the selection of beers, I have tried a new beer almost every time we go there.  Pricing for meals and dining with 2 adults, 1 teenager and 2 small kids runs us about $120 to 160.  4 stars for lack of peanut/treenut free options for desserts - if they do this I'll update to 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Met some friends that were in town from the States here. It had some pretty good reviews and a large selection of beer on tap. We made reservations online and arrived just a little early. We were seated right away and promptly asked what we would like to drink. The service was fantastic at the beginning but went downhill as the night progressed. Food was overcooked (ordered medium rare, came out medium well). My wife had to wait while everyone else had their food. Poutine was lacking cheese and the waitress assured me it would be a great introduction to the concoction for our guests. I should have gone with my gut but she did so well with the beer suggestions...  All in all, great place to stop in for a beer after work but nowhere to bring guests for dinner. Small menu and although the waitress was a hoot her service got worse as the night went on and the place was not busy whatsoever.  Will likely not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! To start off, when we were seated, the small plates on the table were dirty. The waitress made a comment, \"checking the plates\" and I said yes and politely slide the two dirty ones toward the end of our table. We did not order appetizers so we didn't have to use them anyway. If we had ordered appetizers, I would have asked for new ones. As for the service, there was a total of 8 people in the entire restaurant so you would think the service would have been superb and quick. Try again, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. We ordered the burger with fries and the chicken club with fries, neither should take 45 minutes to prepare. For the wait, we were expecting something great and it was not great it was barely eatable. The burger was ordered medium, it came out completely burnt without the cheese, and our fries were cold. When I asked the waitress for some cheese, they didn't even have slices. She brought me out shredded American cheese on probably one of those small dirty plates. Bottom line. Do not waste your time with this place. The city is far too large to waste a meal on shitty food and poor service."}
{"text":"This place was great. It's all about the beer selection, which I would rank higher than Bier Markt.  Tried a sampler, which is a great way to start your experience. You may want to set aside a few hours to go through the beer list!  The food is great too."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the bar is very easy to get too.  Great interior design.   I really enjoyed the live music. The only downside was the long line to get onto the patio. Overall, West 50 is a really fun place."}
{"text":"I am going to be honest, Canada's beer, wine, liquor selection is dismal at best. I won't go into the reasons, but that's the fact. This place is an oasis in a desert of beverage mediocrity that I roam like Moses when traveling to Toronto for work. Tons of beers on tap from micobrews and abroad give this place most likely one of the best beer selections in metro Toronto.  Not only are the drinks awesome, but the food is always delicious. Burgers, pastas - it's all good. One of the bartenders is pretty knowledgable about all the beers and their flavors, something that is rare to find.   Seriously, if you ever go to Mississauga with the intent to drink beer and you don't go here, you are just wasting your time at some other place."}
{"text":"This is BULLLSHIT! The food was good but the waiter constantly got our order wrong (even our bills). This is seriously BULLSHITTT!! Will probably never come again no matter how good the food is!"}
{"text":"I don't understand. I am really upset about this experience! I met a friend for drinks around 9pm and I was excited about returning to West 50 after I had a great time here for another friends birthday. Boy, oh, boy was I wrong! The place was crowded (completely understandable for a Friday night) and the music was way too loud. My throat actually hurts from yelling over the music. It really irritates me when establishments over-do the volume of the music.  The service: What service? As I mentioned my friend and I arrived at 9 and our drink order wasn't taken until 9:45...fine, whatever I will let it pass.. but after 9:30 West 50 becomes a seat yourself establishment, which is okay if you can find a seat. Well after about an hour we found a little booth. I had previously ordered the \"pourhouse burger\" while we were sitting at the bar and I went up to the bar after 20 minutes of waiting and there was my burger just sitting on the bar. Well needless to say it was cold. I was fuming at this point...why would you just leave someones food sitting where anyone can touch it? To top it off the servers were so rude and curt with us. Very, very unhappy.    The food: Well as I said my burger was cold and dry and my fries were cold and over salted. So not impressed.   Why two stars: Well I ordered a margarita and it was amazing (10 stars for the margarita!) and they had a house magician who did some card tricks for us! So entertaining, he was really talented and overall a fun person!   The verdict: I will avoid coming here in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant shouldn't even be a restaurant. The first time I went here was for a friend's birthday, the pizza or flathead we ordered was tasteless and unimpressive. Then when we wanted to pay for our bill, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We  went to the front counter and waitress there wouldn't let us pay until she finds our waitress. Wound up waiting for 20min until she finally showed up, didn't even apologize. Needless to say no tip was given. Second time we had to go there was for a private event, my friend and I decided to share the seafood alimone pasta. We have never been so disappointed by the portion for the price of $21. We thought they were bringing us another plate since we were sharing. On top of that, the flavour was bland and when we told the waitress about it, she said it's because it's a seafood dish and these wind up being expensive. Even then, there were only 3 shrimps in the entire dish. You're not an upscale restaurant so don't offer your guests that kind of portion. So we asked to speak to the manager and nobody even bothered coming. It took us half an hour just to have our waters on the table, our friend's steak was well done when he asked for medium rare, and our other friend's aioli which came with her fries has definitely gone off. I will NEVER return to this place. I have no idea how it's even surviving. The service is a joke and the food is overpriced and complete garbage."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, the sliders were fantastic! I could eat those all night! Huge beer selection, going to come back for their wings soon.  It is in an odd location, but there is super cheap parking next door in the garage. Free for the first hour, and $1.25 after! Cant find that downtown!  Great patio too, will be back in the summer to sip on a Paulaner from the tap!"}
{"text":"Though I love going to West 50 for their enormous selection of beers, I have to say out of all the \"beer houses\" I have been to, this is definately the most expensive.  A pint/ half a pint of beer for 10 dollars?  Even the domestic pints are around 6 dollars, but coors light?  Ridiculous.  I also find that the staff behind the bar aren't that friendly or attentive.    That being said, their food isn't bad, and it's a great place to have parties because you get the table space for people to sit and enjoy food and drinks, while also having a great dance floor and live music."}
{"text":"West 50 experience was horrible!! A  reservation for 20 at 7:30 p.m. 8 out of 20 had no food by 10:00. (And we didn't order apps.) One person NEVER did get food and left disgusted like the rest of us."}
{"text":"Good view but furniture is in bad shape. Slow service. Average food. Good for change though."}
{"text":"I went here for a work lunch this week. Due to my allergy I requested to know what on the menu was gfree - I was told the beer chili was - which was confusing since beer has gluten. She checked with the kitchen and they realized it wasn't gfree (yikes!). In the end I ordered a turkey burger and salad and had no reaction so that was a perk. The burger was great. The salad was quite bland - just spring mix, a few shredded carrot pieces and some light dressing that I couldn't really taste. The food my co-workers got looked great, big portions and everyone was pleased.  My biggest complaint was that we had to wait 45 minutes for our food. Not great when you're on your lunch at work. The food came pretty much when we needed to leave. Otherwise it was a fairly decent experience. I don't think I'd return by choice due to the lack of knowledge about gfree food, but if I didn't have allergy issues I think I'd drop in now and again.  I don't drink beer (obvs) but it should be noted that they do have the biggest and best selection of beers in the GTA"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Mississauga, by far! Not only they have a huge and diverse selection of fantastic beers ON TAP, their menu is two steps above the pub food you might be expecting. For one, they have a very tasty beet salad (girls, your dream is realized), add some tasty wings, charcuterie boards and many more perfectly executed dishes and you wouldn't want to leave the place.  They also have special menus from time to time, like for Oktoberfest and they are also super delish.  All in all, west 50 is perfect place to forget about calorie count of beers and simply indulge in this national drink."}
{"text":"ive been here alot over the years for random night outs and birthday things but this place has gone horribly downhill.   first of all the dj i experienced this past sat night was horrible. he had no idea how to read a crowd, his music transitions were horrible (abrupt switching) and just generally sounded like a high school kid who was practicing in his basement.  secondly, i know that crowds can be hit or miss anywhere you go. but the last few times ive been here the crowd has been consistently STRANGE. half of the crowd is on drugs/super drunk and dancing insanely the entire time not caring if they hit you or fall onto you. the other half of the crowd are creepy men just standing in the middle of the dancefloor hoping for a girl to accidentally nudge them or dance close enough for them to try and creep on you. like ugh...just so bad. theres a reason why ppl were just dancing at their tables in the seating area   other than that, they have a decent patio ..obviously tons of beer to choose from. but i would really advise to not come here..maybe head to bier markt down the street for a more upscale crowd."}
{"text":"We were stopping through on our way to New York and and we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try a restaurant with so many beer options. The place is easy to find with parking near by. We both loved the food and beer and the service was friendly and attentive. Absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"I came here late night on a Fri/Sat.  We sat at the bar and ordered food and drinks.  We sat at the bar because it was busy and we couldn't get a table, plus it was late and they were closing some of the tables.  Most people coming in were just there to listen to music and drink beer, which is usually what I like to do as well.  The service was decent, she was quick to get our food and take our orders.  They have lots of beer to choose from, so that's a plus.  The prices were fair, and the quality of our food was decent as well.  The atmosphere was a bit lacking, but it all depends on who you are with.  I would definitely recommend this place to try for drinks on a fri or sat night with friends.  Derek"}
{"text":"I was visiting from the States for business and a colleague recommended this place for lunch.  The fare was pretty familiar except for the Poutine, which is apparently a Canadian dish, so I went with that.  It was certainly not diet friendly being beef with cheese curds over french fries in a bowl of gravy!  But it was tasty and filling.  Quality of food was good and the prices seemed fine as well.  The atmosphere was really nice too.  It was quiet enough for conversation but then again there weren't too many people in there.  We would definitely visit this one again on another trip."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I guess they changed ownership. This place is now horrible. I can't fathom how downhill this place has gone. Firstly, they have nothing on tap any more. Even Budwiser now comes out of a bottle. The night we went, the credit and debit machines were not working, forcing us to use the ATM in the restaurant which charges service fees. We prearranged some food to arrive (we had a party of 15 people) and that food arrived an hour later than agreed; and the portions were smaller than agreed (8 slice pizzas arrived instead of 12 slice). Drink (pop, not alcohol) refills took in excess of 20 minutes to arrive and the food took more than an hour to get here. The bathroom lacks hot water and paper towels or hand dryer. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again. What ahorrible experience."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out Chef Prong's new menu. Since he revamped the entire menu, I will have to go back again and again to try everything. This time around I had the Orecchiette (marinated baby tomato, woodlot mushrooms, leeks, vermouth cream, parmesan) and my husband had the Lamb Shoulder Gnocchi (tomato, morel mushroom, buffalo mozzarella, grana padano, basil, fried polenta). Both are equally delicious - fresh pasta, you can't go wrong. And if you need a little snack, the chips are great.  There are many beers to choose from but my favorites are Fruli and Stiegl Grapefruit Radler. Yes, I like fruity beers but I am also willing to try others. Gord, one of the servers is extremely knowledgeable with every beer they offer. If you don't know what to order, I highly suggest asking Gord. He is also a great conversationalist!"}
{"text":"Had an event here last week and was thrilled with the beer selection here! They are serious about beer and have tonnes of different beers on tap. You will have to come here a hundred times to try them all!   Food was pretty decent for what you would find at a place like this. Bruschetta was amazing, wings were pretty good, and the sliders were delicious! We ordered a bunch of other appetizers as well and they were all good with the exception of the pizza - would not recommend that.   We booked the private room and at first the set up wasn't what we had requested but the events staff helped us turn the room around fairly quickly. Service was fine, the waitress was nice but there were definitely times where we had to go search for someone to get their attention. Since we had a fairly large party, I would have expected more support but we had no large problems.   Only really annoying thing was the parking, it took me forever to find parking and it was underground and confusing and just annoying. Probably wouldn't have an event here again unless everyone had already been here before to reduce confusion."}
{"text":"If you want a good selection of beers on tap, then this is the place to go.  You will be amazed when you walk in as you look at all the beer taps along the bar, then when you turn the corner, you will be double amazed as you check out even more beers on tap.  I tried counting them and I got lost in the count (somewhere around 30...).  The place also turns into a club-style situation on the weekends with a live band and a great party atmosphere.  The food is good, not great, but the bonus here is really the beer.  Parking can be a bit tricky as it is underground or across the street.    Overall a great place to go for a beer, watch a game and have some wings."}
