{"text":"5pm on a Friday, dine in for two.
Cute restaurant with a fresh clean look. It was empty at this time. You're served with either hot or cold tea while you decide what to order. We chose hot tea. Normally when you finish pouring into the little cup you'll get some spillage between the cup and the porcelain teapot. No spillage! Can you believe that?! No drips what so ever as these were teapots made of tin! I found this to be a great improvement!! No one wants wet tables while they eat!!

My partner went to the ladies room and so I ordered for her and I. As I placed the order the waitress had to ask me \"are you sure?\" Twice. Not that the meal was bad but she was just genuinely concerned I might be ordering the wrong meal for her. Haha. 

Ordered the pho with beef balls and rare steak and a vermicelli dish for her. The soup and beef balls were tasty but steak strips was rubbery and had no flavour."}
{"text":"Found this place when seeking for some Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Pancake). They have so many options for Banh Xeo. We ordered one with pork&shrimp and the other with beef and mushroom. Love the crispy crust and the freshness of meat and the vegetable that comes with it. Definitely satisfy your eyes with such a colorful presentation. We came in for a treat as well when they just introduced the new dessert called Fried Mango Ice cream.  Would definitely come back for more creative Vietnamese dishes here especially when they're all no MSG!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good bowl of Pho. The broth started off a bit sweet but after squeezing a few wedges of lime into it the broth balanced out a bit more."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my friends and found the place really clean and nicely decorated
They have a nice variety of vegetarian dishes - I had the crispy noodle vegetable and it was delish 
Management and staff are also very friendly; will be returning to this restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff, service is fast and food is really good, I've just tried the beef and chicken Pad Thai and saut√© spicy beef pho , delicious and prices are good too for what you're getting.  will keep on going back!
Just went last night again Sept 27, 2015. Ordered veggie spring rolls ( fried), Pad Thai with beef and veggies, and crispy noodles with veggies and added beef spicy. To begin, the Pad Thai had no taste at all, didn't taste anything like before, however the other items were very good. This place isn't consistent unfortunately ...... :( bummer. Service was good as usual. Can't change rating but I would definitely say 3 star."}
{"text":"Okay new Management so thats what the sign said.
I went in at 12pm place had a ew customers, great decor and very clean.
I was greeted and sat down they took my order and soup and spring rolls came out 10min later a little slow compared to other Pho places . I had the spicy pho not the best I had the broth was not rich enough . the spring rolls were great they get 5 stars for that.
it was much better then that last time i was in this building. 
They seem to be on top of every thing from what I seen.
I will return to try other items on there menu.
see picture of my soup to see what I mean"}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch special, we ordered crispy spring roll with noodle soup w/ chicken and crispy spring roll with rice and grilled beef. The food came out quick, maybe within less than ten minutes. 

For starters, the spring roll was basically oil with no veggies inside. The shrimp roll was decent. When it came to the main dishes, the noodle soup broth was bland and the chicken was rubbery and tasted as if it sat in the fridge for a long time. The only thing consumable was the broth. The rice and grilled beef dish was majorly just a pile of rice with 4 pieces of beef. The beef has an odd taste to it and also rubbery. I have had pho and rice dishes many times and was extremely disappointed. The food was barely touched since we did not feel comfortable with the circumstances of our food. 

When we approached the \"waitress\" about our food, she asked if we wanted something else, which we declined. After, she just walked away and brought out the manager. He told us that we sat there for over an hour (we were there for half an hour) and we did not say anything, not even listening to what we had to say. He just decided to yell over us the entire time, not allowing us to get a word out. He kept stating that we came to his restaurant just to talk. He basically said that he has never had a complaint, and continued to raise his voice, along with the waitress. After not being able to express how we felt, he told us to leave. As we walked out, he decided to tell, what I assume to be \"frequent customers\", about how we sat there for an hour and didn't mention anything bad about our food. I then told him that he should not be telling customers of the situation and he had terrible customer service. He then told us that he hopes to never see us again in his restaurant. 

Definitely will not be back here after the horrific customer service I received. We were not able to communicate with them as they wouldn't let us get a word out. I hope no one experiences what we just had to deal with."}
{"text":"This \"Pho\" noodle stop exceeded my expectations. As an avid traveler I got exactly what I wanted (vegan pho) and the food was served with passion and dedication! This family owed business is a great stop!"}
{"text":"Great pho place. Prices are cheap, the restaurant itself is totally renovated and clean. The food is great and the pho options with regards to broth is not something I've seen at other places (pho, chicken and veggie broth). Last time I visited I got the seafood pho as take out. Packed well and tasted very fresh. The service was great. Really is the best pho restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"When I walked in with a friend, we was greeted and seated immediately. The waitress was extremely friendly. We ordered the same thing, and it took half an hour for the only one of the dishes to arrive. It took fifteen minutes for us to realize that they forgot about the second dish for me. We had to remind them and waited ten more minutes. 

When the food arrived, I had high expectations for the food. I ordered the pho, and was extremely disappointed. The soups didn't have that punch or flavour. The noodles still had that under cooked, plastic taste to it. The beef balls tasted great though, and made up for the awful noodles and soup. 

The decor was amazing. The colours all complimented each other (blue and white), and the artwork was placed all in the right place. It was really clean, but table cleaning service was a bit slow, there was a table that still had the other dishes on it, and no one took the initiative to clean it. Not until someone had to sit there, and they had to rush and clean it while the customers stood behind, waiting. It seems like the restaurant only has a worker, as the waitress was just rushing around, while the other employees just stood behind the desk or in the kitchen, chatting and watching everything.

All in all, I wouldn't come here again. The food was disappointing, and their service was only mediocre."}
{"text":"I liked this place when it was pho ginger. 

We came for a quick lunch. We both ordered pho, and were served fairly quick. I felt like the service was less friendly than pho ginger, yet it wasn't terrible. 

The pho tasted okay, but I felt there was a lot of MSG, and mentioned this to the server.

Honestly nothing great about this location. It's okay but would prefer to go to I love pho if I'm in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Restaurant looks nice (for pho restaurant standards) but I thought the food was just average. I had banh xeo (Vietnamese savoury pancake) which was advertised as their specialty dish but I've had better (banh cuon Thanh Truc at St. Clair and Runnymede is an example). Not enough greens and fish sauce. The pho was also just average and the side plate of garnishing was minimal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice, I love the decor. Food is good I like how they don't use MSG, the pho broth seems more clear than other places I've been to. It's about $5.00 for a small vegetarian pho soup and $2.00 extra for two meat add ons. I wouldn't get the calamari as it was $8.50 and the portion was extremely small, and was only mediocre. I also ordered vermicelli which was really good. Overall it was OK.

UPDATE/ next morning: my brother who ordered the rice dish with egg and chicken had an uncomfortable stomach this morning  maybe the chicken was undercooked???"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and it says Fine Vietnamese restaurant.  Which is why the prices were high. Not sure why some other reviews say the price was cheap?  Maybe they haven't been to pho places in Toronto, Scarborough or North York.

I ordered the large beef ball pho and yea the soap was not as salty as other places but large didn't seem very large.  The amount of bean sprouts they handed me was so tiny. Much less than other Viet restaurants. See photo. 

My friend ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, $7 and boy was it lacking. 1 tomato, 3 small shrimps, and not much else (see photo).  Totally unlike their amazing looking photo.

For a fine dining restaurant, small portions and charging these prices it is definitely not value for your money.   I would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Not authentic at all. I am Vietnamese and eat Vietnamese food all over the GTA. Cheap on condiments, way over priced. Not a single Vietnamese customer in the restaurant during dinner time... Now I know why. On top of that, charged me on items I did not order. Making up stories and lies accusing that I did order. Pulled out the paper she took our order on. Shows nothing we ordered and still tries to make a quick buck. She later on found out I was Vietnamese and started apologizing. What a joke. I'd give -5 star if I can."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. It's my go to pho place in Mississauga, more so than pho mi 99. I've been coming here for a year and a half now and I LOVE it. The pho soup taste very different though from a year ago but I do like it better. The place is spotless and very chill and open, they have one TV at the front and music playing at a considerable volume. The service here is quick and friendly, not much interaction but every worker there is quite nice. Because I come here only on weekends (on my way to school), there are few customers so orders come rather quick. I LOVE the food here, good portion sizes and honestly quite cheap for great, decently healthy food. The pho here is my favourite, to me it's a bit sweeter and more fragrant (cinnamon is strong) which I love, the beef is tender and rare and a generous amount is given. If you have a small stomach, a small is definitely enough, they give a pretty big portion size. I also love the variety of candy given at the checkout counter, the middle age gentleman there (cook? Owner? Idk) is so sweet and always urges me to take more candy. Give this place a try, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied  I ordered pad see ew and I got a whole bunch of veg and noodles covered in gravy?!? Eww so mad right now I was so hungry"}
{"text":"I guess third time's a charm. I think this is the 3rd owner of this pho establishment and previous management had their food way too salty.  

I had the vegetarian pho and fresh veggie rolls.  The veggie rolls were great especially with the mango and the accompanying peanut sauce was very tasty.  With regards to the vegetarian pho, I thought it was quite tasty and it came with plenty of veggies (per the pic) and also plenty of noodles as well. They called it a \"small\", but I think the size was more like a medium.  

In addition, the service was very friendly and personable.  A great improvement from previous ownership.

UPDATE: I've been here twice now and am always impressed."}

{"text":"The best tasting pho I've ever had. They always use fresh ingredients and no msg. The interior is clean and well maintained. The staff are all very friendly and efficient. They have always used fresh ingredients and the taste is always consistent."}
{"text":"I would go back here, but not due because it left an imprint in my mind, but because of the following:

1. Broth isn't too salty or too oily, it was okay, I liked it that I'd go back;
2. It's much quieter than Pho 99 up the road;
3. Quick and efficient service; 
4. There's wifi; and
5. There's ample parking in the plaza.

The downsides include:

1. The beef brisket and rare beef was only rare beef.  Where's the brisket???

A quirk here:

1. The hot sauce has some stringy stuff you do not see at other pho places.  I can't tell you what that stringy stuff was.  It didn't really add anything to the chili oil, just changed the texture.  So who knows.

I read in other reviews that you can fashion your own soup re: which ingredients go in, but I didn't see that option on the menu.

All in all, if I need a quick pho fix and wifi to check my emails, I'd go here."}
{"text":"I suggest the mango shake!! It's great. I had spring rolls and meatball pho. The pho was great and so was the service. 
I recommend you stop and try."}
{"text":"I love the option to have good Vietnamese food nearby and 
late at night. Ever since Pho Queen City changed their hours, this was no longer an option, until My Pho came along.

Open til 4am on weekends, My Pho is easily open late enough to satisfy all but the latest of sleepers. They're even open til midnight on weekdays!

The service for this time of night was as good as can be asked for. Food came out very fast and steaming hot.

I enjoyed my bowl of bun bo hue, my favourite Vietnamese dish. It wasn't very spicy but the there was a good balance and there was a good variety of beef and vietnamese sausage to accompany the vermicelli noodles and vegetables. 

At 3am, the owner even came out once we were finished our dishes to give us each a bowl of ice cream - 2 black cherry ice creams and one strawberry. I'm not sure where the black cherry is from but it was delicious! Large pieces of cherries were found throughout.

Really enjoyed my first visit to My Pho - I should be back here often."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. While reading Yelp reviews I stumbled across My Pho. Hot and New??!!!  Whaaat!  I gots to try this place out. 
It was Labour Day 2015, I was severely hung over from last nights karaoke, beer and vodka BBQ.  I needed food.  I took the 8 month pregnant wife and 6 year old daughter with me to check the place out.  We walked into the restaurant to find that the internal temperature was hotter than the 34 Deg that it was outside.  OMG.  

Benny hungry and think to himself that Viet Food in a Sauna good for hangover.  Sweat out toxins.  LOL.  

Within 20 seconds the sweat feast began.  Lawd!

Our order:
a) Pork Chop with Fried Egg and Rice.
b) Grilled Pork, Chicken, Fried Egg and Rice.
c) Pho with Rare Beef.
d) Pork Spring Rolls.

Please note that the photo in the menu for item A was not accurate.  The photo details \"two\" pork chops.  We got one.  Disappointed.
Both items A and B come with a fried egg.  We were served sunny side up fried eggs with the yolks broken and spread.  This is new to me.  I like to break the yolk and mix it up with my rice.  Disappointed again.
I love the green onion topping on the meat and rice.  It is great.  However, the meat was also basted in some sort of oil.  The Green onion oil perhaps?  Way too much oil on the pork chop.  Disappointed again.
I did find the the grilled pork and chicken to be yummy.
Now I did read in another review that the Pork Spring Rolls were a must order.  So I did.  They were good but too oily.  That is my biggest peave about Viet Spring Rolls,, I dislike them when they are too oily.  
Pho.  Soup stock was ok but eating hot soup in a restaurant that is 39 Degrees Celsius is,,, LAWD!!!!!  It proved to me that eating in a sauna sucks big time.   
At the end of it all, I was soaked from my head to just underneath my belt line.   Fortunately, I did sweat out a lot of alcohol toxins.  I  felt so much better after eating despite all my disappointment.  
The resto Manager or owner did approach us and inquire as to how our meal was. Now he looked like a super nice guy and all but What do you say?  Brutal honesty?  White lies?  With sweat billowing down my brow, I  say,  \"it was delicious\".  Ninja Please!!  Leave me alone right now.  Go turn on the A/C.  
Service.  Service was great.  They actually take your order here instead of you having to write it down.  Great girls working the front line.  Plenty of parking and lot of comfy seating.  
This place is bit more pricey than others.  
Peace out Yelper!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. I really appreciate it when Vietnamese restaurants offer vegetarian options, because I don't see much of it. Especially for the Banh Xeo, so good! We also tried the veggie spring rolls which were great as well."}
{"text":"Really good. Not as cheap as other pho places but worth the money. Lunch specials are very affordable."}
{"text":"Bright and clean.. 
The rare beef pho was excellent. 
I also like the flashy sign!
Going back tonight, must be good!"}
{"text":"Since firstly tasted Pho in The Vietnamese quarter of Paris a few years back, I've been a big fan of Vietnamese beef noodle AKA Pho. Throughout the years, I have been to at least a dozen of Vietnamese Pho places in GTA. When I stayed abroad, I also frequently looked for Pho restaurants in different countries. 

With my experience, it is fair to say, overall, this My Pho restaurant is definitely the best Pho place that I've ever been to. Previously, I visited this place under the old management once, but I wasn't too impressed at that time. However, the new management of this place seems to bring the quality of the food as well as many other important factors here to a satisfaction level beyond usual expectation. Therefore my review will only focus my experience with this place since the new management took it over in December 2015.

I'm now a frequent patron of My Pho and here are the reasons why I like it so much and why I think it really stands out from any other Pho places:

1. Quality and size of food. Simply amazing! 

In comparison to any other chain Pho places, My Pho surely has better food quality. Taking the example of my all time favorite their Special Pho, not only their size is extremely filling (I usually order a large and I literally see a small mountain of assorted beef meat, sitting on top of some noodle. Upon finishing up, I won't feel hungry for at least 4 to 5 hours, while other places only maintain me for 3), the kitchen only uses the best material and soup stock as I can tell. The owner are also willing to listen to customers' feedback. One common thing with Vietnamese Pho is that they are sometimes heavy with MSG in their soup, which cause people to feel thirsty afterwards. So noticing such concern, the owner has changed the recipe of the soup and now it's MSG-free. Since then, I do feel the difference and I like it even more because it tastes only better and it's even healthier. I have also tried a few other dishes, like the curry, stay beef noodle, or the Saturday lunch special Vietnamese crepe, none of them ever lowered my expectation what this amazing place can produce. 

2. Quality of service. Very friendly and caring. 

Once you enter, staffs will greet you immediately and serve you with a hot cup of water or tea, according to your preference. Once you place an order, expect it to come up quick enough to prevent you feeling boredom. After your food is served, not only the staffs and but the owner will also frequently come to check if you are happy with your order. I notice this place is a family run business, not the normal type of chain restaurant. Perhaps that explains why you feel always being treated so nicely and genuinely every time you visit. 

3. Quality of ambience. Outstanding.

Unlike a lot of Pho places where seats are arranged in a over-crowded manner, and tables are not so well kept, this place is spacious and fairly bright with its top down  window storefront. It has marble tables and couch-like sofa for seating, great for lone wolf type of gourmet like me, or couples, or even larger family groups. I can tell that the staffs take pains to keep this place extremely clean as they are almost constantly doing the cleansing. Overall, the interior decoration are also way better than any other Pho pages I've been to. Well up to the standard of a decent family restaurant.

4. Pricing. Bang for your buck.

After all the positives factors I've pointed out, I would like add the pricing of their menu is very reasonable. I usually end up paying around 11 bucks for a large bowl of Special Pho, tip and tax included. Unlike many other restaurants in the same group, this place also takes credit card, debit and cash, regardless the final amount is. They also  the latest POS terminal (it's like an iPad) which works like charm when it comes to payment. It can even email your receipt to your email address! I don't think many restaurants can boast such great and flexible payment options. Just another reason why I love this place.

In sum, if you are a big fan of Vietnamese Pho like me in Mississauga, don't ever miss an opportunity to visit this amazing place. Try their menu and I'm sure after that you would largely agree with me for the reasons why I love this place quite so :-D"}
{"text":"I have been to at least a dozen of Vietnamese pho places in GTA. I also went to a few pho places in the Vietnamese/Chinese quarter in Paris, France. This is definitely a top three pho place amongst all the places which I have been to. Very friendly staff and super tasty special pho. The portion is extremely fulfilling for a big guy like me, if you order a large. I think it's reasonably priced as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy but it wasn't empty either.  The place IS really clean.  I like that.  They could've gone with a cleaner colour to paint the walls but, the place still remains very put together.  Service is excellent too.  All three of the employees working that day were very friendly and were quick to refill waters on request.

This was my first time here so I decided to get the chicken and beef on rice.  My friend got the shrimp and chicken pad Thai.  It was a little frustrating because the server I was talking to couldn't understand me when I was asking if there was shrimp paste in the pad thai sauce.  She kept thinking I was talking about the actual shrimp pieces.  I'm allergic to shellfish but can still eat noodles if shrimp touches it.  it's only if I actually consume it, that I will react.  I know some places use shrimp paste in their pad Thai so I wanted to make sure.  Anyways, I couldn't try the pad Thai because I didn't want to take the chance.  However, my friend said it was really salty and he could barely finish it.  He also said it was a bit sour as well. My dish was mediocre.  I have definitely had better else where.  Chicken was meh.  Kind of small.  The beef had a lot of fat on it but the meaty parts were good.  Spring rolls were the highlight.  I got the crunchy spring rolls with chicken.  Very good.  The complimentary ice cream is a nice touch.  I preferred the mango ice cream over the strawberry banana.  I don't really like mango ice cream but it's what I would choose between the two.

I will come back eventually to try their pho.  Although there are so many other places to get pho, but we will see."}
{"text":"Great food there. Great customer service. Everything on the menu is so far worth the money you pay for. Has the tv on mostly funny videos gags. Keeping the atmosphere great.

Really honest people. I left my phone once on the table and the guy quickly came outside to give me my phone. 

Definitely recommend people to go there."}
{"text":"The two stars were for the dish I ate. The grilled beef with rice was good and tasty. My date ordered a particular soup dish that has the option of putting the noodles separate from the broth. She specified this in Vietnamese so that the staff would know. She also alerted the wait staff so there would be no confusion. The dish came out and it was not the right version. The noodles were in the soup broth which is the one she does not like. She was upset and couldnt eat it. I alerted the staff to the situation and though the younger waitress felt bad, nothing was done even though it was their fault. Sadly, this is all that takes to lose a life long customer. I will not be returning back unfortunately. 2 stars for my dish only. **"}
{"text":"Clean looking place, the owner and service was very friendly! The menu had ample options at decent prices. I would highly recommend for a cheap eat in the area that also has great service and looks really new, they seem to be open everyday till midnight."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than expected, and definitely a reliable spot for decent pho with good-sized portions, set within a clean, modern, refined atmosphere. Clearly, this isn't your corner Pho Mi. The decor is actually quite clean and classy, and it looks like a nice, reliable spot for a date, a family dinner, a group of friends, etc. It's a versatile atmosphere that accommodates a variety of circumstances.

First, parking. It's in a busy plaza located on the southeast corner of Mavis Road and Eglinton Avenue W (just a block north from the Mavis Road exit of Highway 403), in the same plaza as No Frills, NCIX, and right beside Sam Woo Chinese Restaurant. There are lots of parking spots, and it shouldn't be too hard to find one despite how busy this plaza gets.

Second, the food. We visited on a weekday afternoon and each ordered the lunch special for $9.00, which includes one appetizer and one main from a specific list (mains to choose from include popular choices like Noodles with Rare Beef and Rice with Grilled Beef, both of which we ordered). We also each had the deep fried chicken spring rolls, which were delicious. Overall, the food was tasty. The pho noodle bowl was a good size, broth wasn't too oily, and was very satisfying. The Rice with Grilled Beef was fine, but the meat was a bit tough. Definitely full of flavourful, but it wasn't the best quality meat so it was a bit difficult to chew. If they improve the quality of their meat, this dish could also become a favourite.

Overall, a very satisfying meal and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tip:  Always look at the DATE of the review before checking a place out!

A bit of a nosedive since my last visit.  I had the \"Special\" pho, #1 I believe, and broth was bland (not complex enough, no anise flavour), and there were a couple of grisly, not super fresh pieces of meat that required the help of my back molars.

Garnish (basil/bean sprouts), on the other hand, was fresh!  I will give them that.

And even though they are small, I do like their beef balls, but why is there always just ONE in the soup??!!  C'mon now, put like 3 at least 'cause they're the size of a grape.

Friend's pork chop was on the small side, which he was fine with, but it looked dry and he said it didn't taste good."}
{"text":"Update - they use MSG!!!!! Like clockwork 30 mins after I consume anything with NSG I get the sweats & have to rush to the bathroom. Not sure if ownership has changed. I am not going back anyways.

Writing this as I am having my pho.

NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!!!

First....I read an earlier review that said no MSG which is the only reason I came. Asked the server 3 times about it & she doesn't speak English well so I let it go. There is also no sign in the restaurant like a previous reviwer mentioned stating that they don't use MSG. I am ultra sensitive to MSG & symptoms usually start about 30 mins after I eat MSG laden food.

Second...I ordered rare beef & got well done.

Third...this is the saltiest pho broth I have ever had in my life!! I left half of it in the bowl & drank 2 glasses of water.

Fourth....a Pho place that is practically empty around 12:30 - 1 pm on a Saturday?!?!?! That should tell you something. It was just me & another family in the restaurant. 

The search for non MSG pho in the west end continues....sigh."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times I left completely satisfied! The customization option is a really nice touch - I usually just opt for Pho Dac Biet at all pho restaurants I go to but my boyfriend liked the 'Make Your Own' option here :) 

I've only eaten Pho both times so I can't really say much about the other food but this is one of the best pho I've eaten in Mississauga. Not just that, the portion was really good - the perfect amount of meat and noodles. Not to mention there is no MSG :P If I lived nearby this would probably be my go-to pho restaurant! 

Definitely recommend & will be returning to try out the other dishes :)"}
{"text":"I just found a Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga that cook Pho without MSG. This restaurant is in the plaza south east of Eglinton and Mavis in mississauga.
The service is good and the food is excellent. The Vietnamese crepe banh xeo is also quite Yummy.
Great value!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 4.5/5.  Knocked off half a star only because I came here for the Banh Xeo with pork and shrimp and was slightly disappointed.  It wasn't anything spectacular and really wished it could have as this is the only place I know that sells them!!

Anyways everything else was amaaaazing! We ordered Pad Thai and the Vermicelli with Grilled Beef  and Spring Roll and holy sh*t it was delish!  Also the calamari was bomb! I was actually really shocked that it would taste so good (no offence) only because not many pho restaurants have calamari and if/when they do it's not good.  As they obviously only specialize in Vietnamese cuisine.  So the calamari here I do recommend!

Service was great and they were super friendly. Bonus! 

My new fave pho place to go to! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is probably my new favourite Pho restaurant in all of Mississauga! I've been here numerous times and I can confidently say that the food is consistently well done as with the service.  

I have had their Pho and Vermicelli dishes and none of the times I've been here have I left disappointed or unsatisfied with any aspect of dining out.  I really like and would absolutely recommend their Vermicelli dishes.  Also, the first few times I've visited, I noticed they had a little sign explicitly stating they did not use MSG in their dishes, and also the adverse effects MSG had for health and after-effects.  I was impressed in their awareness of cheats other restaurants use, and their decision to not advocate for it.  This is definitely noticeable in their Pho broth since it tastes much more home-made and not overly salty...

Service here is great as well.  It is quick and efficient, and never have our orders come out wrong.  The manager is also quite sensible since every time we come here as a larger group, there is always dessert on the house :) Atmosphere is also great since the restaurant has gone for the bright clean look with high ceilings and lots of natural light.  I throughly enjoy dining here, and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Third time here as I like the atmosphere and the cleanliness. 

Plenty of parking as its in the same plaza as No Frills. 

Happy: The noodle soup was hot and satisfying. I devoured it as I was hungry and it didn't disappoint. The bean sprouts and basil were nicely displayed. 
My partner had the chicken pad Thai And it is a large portion for $9.50. Nicely displayed than other places. Love the carrot touch at the side. It's not too sweet which is great. A bit tangy.   

Verdict: I've already been back so definitely I would recommend this place. It also has eight booth seating which is nice."}
{"text":"This is actually my second review here. Strangely, my first review disappeared (and all the other reviews for this place, mostly negative, along with it) even though the only thing that changed with this restaurant is the management (not even the ownership, name, or location). 

Anyway, this review is more positive because the vermicelli dish I got was actually pretty good. They use thicker noodles here which I actually like more and it's pretty unique too.  My only complaint is that the food came out barely warm, which happened the last time I came here too except that time it happened with the pho. It took them only about 5 minutes to get the food ready but I would've rather had it come out in 7 minutes and be hot."}
{"text":"My last visit here was pretty bad. The pho soup was lukewarm and they didn't give enough noodles. The broth was still tasty as usual but it really needs to be piping hot for it to be good. We also got the curry beef flank. The curry was very bland and watery. Not recommended. The pho would be good if they would just make the broth hotter."}
{"text":"Bright, clean and empty. 
On lunch time the place no seen customer inside. We order spring rolls veg and medium size of pho. 
The spring rolls veg is hot and crunchy but I'm not sure they have veg , it seem just glass noodles somewhat also no much taste in it. We have to dip with fish sauce so we can have some flavour. 
The broth pho I'm not sure they use MSG or NOT but I like it. Is clean taste."}
{"text":"Ordered pho and veggie pad Thai. The pho was okay, not enough noodles and meats. However when my vegan bf asked for the veggie pad Thai (making sure there isn't any seafood in it.. some places throw in shrimp) we found chicken! We notified the server and she said that the chicken wasn't cooked with the Pad thai?? Didn't offer to do anything about it either."}
{"text":"I decided to take my sister for lunch here instead of driving further for pho. Every time I go here it's never busy which is disappointing because My Pho has so much to offer. 

Service was great throughout our stay. Besides the service I really like how their broth is freshly made without MSG. The previous owner put a lot of MSG which was noticeable while eating. The broth now is very clear and tastes healthy. The pieces of chicken in my pho were tender and juicy. My sister also ordered pad thai as takeout but she didn't really enjoy it that much. 

I'll be back in the near future if I'm ever craving for pho."}
{"text":"The four of us decided to try out My Pho again after they messaged my boyfriend. Apparently the restaurant is under new management.

We had dinner yesterday evening and again it wasn't busy. There were just two other tables occupied. I noticed they're on social media now when I read the Happy Hour Drink specials. If you hashtag their restaurant you could win a 20% weekly discount. 

The three of us had pho and a friend ordered the pad thai. The pho was okay and had less MSG. I wasn't thirsty after eating there.

{"text":"I  visit from southern California and looking for a good  and come across this place.  I am very surprise how good the food is compare to little Saigon even.  The manager great and honest at advising us which courses are best fit our taste.  Ask for Huy the manager.  I'll be back here on my next time in town."}
