{"text":"Interesting Somali family-run restaurant. Very good food in large portions. Very tasty meat and vegetarian dishes. The restaurant also serves traditional Somali breakfast, consisting of fried liver, onions and injera-like bread. Highly recommended. The service is extraordinarily friendly and easy-going. Great find!"}
{"text":"I'm not Somali, but they honestly make great food and their portions are large.  I eat from them from time to time and their food is always fresh.  Well-trained, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Taste of Somalia!!!  I found this hidden gem when looking for different places near my work place. I was up there with my team for lunch. The restaurant is located in a old plaza, this here is a self serve restaurant where you walk up to the front as ask them to make you a plate and then you pay and enjoy your food.   Service here was top notch, I asked the server how does it work and he was very nice and helped us with making the plate, he explained the dishes. I believe you could have up to three or four items from different areas and instead of choosing those, he offered us bunch of things to try on our plate.   All the servers were very friendly from the person making out plate to the person who came with drinks to our place. The restaurant has plenty of seats.  Now coming to the food, the menu was amazing so many things to choose from. As I said we had many bits of thing so on my plate, I had Rice, Beef stew, Fried chicken, BBQ sauce chicken, salad and a Somalian dish eaten instead of rice with gravy. I topped the plate with hot sauce on the side. Let me tell you all the meat on my plate was tender, tasty and good to the bone. Loved all of it!  While we were eating, one of the server came and told us, we also get a juice drink with a sit in meal. So I went with mango juice, he was very nice as asked us how the food was and as he notice it was our first time, they brought us some samosas (purely filled with spicy meat and not lime your usual samosas) and Mandhasi (a sweet bread/ donuts) on the house.   Overall, very good experience!  P.S. They serve halal food."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on here before but this place compelled me to do so. My husband and I went on a whim, and boy am I glad we did! The customer service was amazing, the food was great and the portions were huge! The prices are really reasonable for what you get, we went in after the lunch crowd and some of the stuff was done, but they made the effort to get us fresh portions from the back.  We got bar b q chicken legs, chicken tikka and butter chicken. Everything was delicious and warm.  Please don't be scared because of what the place looks like from the outside, go inside it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything smelled wonderful, and it would have been great if I could have actually TASTE the food!  I requested a vegetarian dish, and the cook said it would be approximately 10 minutes to accommodate me.  I asked for some Naan bread or something while I waited, and the host grabbed a pre-packaged bag of dinner rolls and offered them to me.  I politely declined, as I thought it would be homemade, authentic Naan or bread made in-house.  Either way, I was willing to wait, and they offered me a seat while I waited.  After 20 minutes, I went to the front of house to check in on the waiting time.  There were only about 5 customers in the restaurant.  I was greeted by a new host, and a new cook who said they had no idea I was waiting for anything because the cook I had spoke to previously just clocked out.    If I hadn't spoken up, I would have been waiting around all night.  I was beyond annoyed and hungry, so I just left.  The staff never tried to make it right or empathized with me.  They just stood there and stared at me.  Very disappointed, as I decided to visit this place based on positive Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Great restaurant experience.  Went in with a couple of hungry friends, left completely satisfied.  No visible menu, but none was needed!  Great selection of traditional Somali cuisine, and very helpful helpful staff who went above and beyond and gave an extra dish on the house.  As we were leaving the restaurant, they insisted we stay for tea, which turned out to be the cherry on top that pushed this review to a full 5/5."}
{"text":"Value: amazing Halaal western food options: big win.  I'm rating this for hallal food purposes. To be able to take mom out for dinner where she can enjoy a steak or ribs in peace and no pretention (black ox bistro comes to mind) is a big win for me.   I had the ribs and pasta - sure as heck going back for that. The potato side dish was very delicately flavoured and I loved it.   Huge portions  I actually had to ask what was Somali on the menu, and the gentlemen behind the counter gave us a sample of yummy rice to try. The beef stew wasn't ready yet, but I will go back to try.  My partner in crime had the chicken wrap- instead of a pita like in a shawarma the contents were in a flaky light scrumptious paratha type roti thingy. Will definately have that again.   Great,  clean, economical, family run joint. The fact that a whole bunch of women kept streaming in with kids, was testament to the home cooked quality of the food. Will go back."}
{"text":"The workers talk too much  They gave me an order of chicken when I didn't even tell them what I wanted. Messy and unsanitary. The food is too expensive."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. The food has always been fresh and very tasty. I'm a vegetarian so I just ask them to make me up a vegetarian plate and they have always been happy to do it. Large portions as well with a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"The best in Somali Food !!   Exploring the Rexdale area, this is by far the best Somalian Food we've had, it has many options and the best part is it is always hot and fresh !  They recently underwent renovation which makes the place more appealing, ambience wise its ok, just that there is also a connected party room and with the music noise, the meal can be really disturbing. The washrooms are not maintained well.  Service wise, it can be a long wait as the line up is always prevalent.   It's a self service place and has multiple combos as well. Our best picks are Butter Chicken, Beef Stew and the Sabayat Wrap. The first two come in a combo with rice and salad and drink, the Wrap comes with a drink. They have a standard price for all combos which is $13. However with the quantity they give it's worth it. The entire box is filled to the top and depending on appetite it can even last for 2 meals.  Other good dishes to try are the Chicken Tikka, the fried drum sticks are ok. They serve all dishes with a Banana, Mango or Lemon Juice. With any food you choose, don't forget to ask for their hot sauce, it makes the dish more delicious.   Also if you are a tea drinker, do not forget to try their tea, it is really unique in flavor and taste.   They do not accept Credit, just Debit or Cash.   Food - 5/5 Ambience - 2/5 Value - 4/5 Service - 3/5"}
{"text":"When my dining companion asked if I wanted to try out a Somalian restaurant, I immediately jumped at the chance to sample a brand-new-to-me cuisine.  We arrived around lunchtime on a Sunday and the place was empty. We were greeted by the friendly clerk behind the counter and warned that a number of dishes weren't ready yet, although I did spot a tasty-looking beef stew of some sort. And indeed, I ordered the Beef Suqaar Anjero, which, according to Google, is \"one of Somalia's most beloved dishes.\" Who could say no to that?  I watched as the clerk began assembling my very large plate, which consisted of the aforementioned Beef Suqaar Anjero, a huge pile of spicy rice, a selection of cooked vegetables, and a small salad. The meal also included a very tasty mango-based drink, so I definitely feel like I got my $16 worth.  And although nothing on the plate blew my mind, I definitely enjoyed everything I ate quite a bit (with one exception). The beef stew, though a little flavorless, is packed with pieces of meat and vegetables, while that spicy rice was seriously delicious and tasty enough to eat on its own. The cooked vegetables didn't fare quite as well, as everything was just soggy and lacking in bold flavors. The salad was pretty good, though."}
{"text":"My first time here. They have mostly somalian food and the staff were super friendly. Explained the goods to us and helped us place our order. Atmosphere is clean and inviting. Great for families. Food tasted good and the mango and lemonade are free."}
{"text":"Went here insanely late during the holidays and yes like always it was open. In the middle of the night in North Etobicoke what can you expect? Amazing. Famous for their late night butter chicken but also serving several other options late into the night you can't beat this. You have to go during the day or evening to get true Somali food like the out of this world goat. Also go for the bur shub shub. Crepe with butter chicken - yum order two."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident. Was there for Fartumo Kusow's book launch, Tale of a Boon's Wife. While the event was catered, I noticed they didn't have bisbas (Somali hot sauce). I can't eat Somali food without bisbas. So I went next door, to the actual restaurant, with the intentions of asking for bisbas. I noticed there wasn't any options on their menu. Out of curiosity, I asked the gentleman, he wasn't Somali - he looked Middle Eastern to me, if there was a vegetarian option. He said no but he could make me a salad. Sadden, I reluctantly agreed. Then he said, are you feeling brave? I'll make you something different. I was beyond excited at this point. He then took sabaayad (Somali flatbread) and added hummus then a variety of cold vegetables and topped it off with mixture carrots and potatoes drizzled with ranch. After rolling this burrito lookalike, he replaced the tinfoil on the (shawarma) as he remembered I mentioned I didn't eat meat. He even used s clean knife to cut my burrito in two! It's very rare to see restaurants use different cutlery and utensils while dealing with meat and non meat meals. As a vegetarian, I was super impressed and appreciative.   Also, it's 24 hours so now I'm definitely coming back.   Thanks for the amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"Istar Restaurant - open 24/7 - is a Cafeteria style dine in and take out restaurant - delicious somali dishes and a few indian dishes. They have traditional somali snacks and sweets as well. You can mix and match 2 dishes with either rice or pasta to make a dinner combo. Service is very helpful and friendly. Only Debit or Cash"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Clean but not fancy interior. Smorgasbord food ordering. Good overall dining experience.   My daughter and I came here expecting an Ethiopian-style experience and cuisine, not having looked at the menu ahead of time. The dishes were actually more what I would have expected from an Indian restaurant: butter chicken, biryani rice, and so on. (That says more about my ignorance regarding African food than it does about the food, I know.)   Everything was excellent, and the servings were generous. The goat dish was particularly good -- make sure to order it if you're wondering what to try."}
