{"text":"I came in here for the first time with a friend on Memorial Day sine we were both off work and thought'd we'd grab brunch.  The restaurant was crowded, inside and out.  I usually dont like staying at places to eat when it is terribly busy but decided to just stay and try it out.    The server approached our table and asked for our drink order.  I asked about how they make their bellini's (type of alcohol used and if it was served frozen or on the rocks, pretty basic questions) and she did not know.  She told us she was \"kind of  new\" and didnt really know too much about the details of ingredients and such (?).  After more awkward conversations not getting anywhere, the bartender approached our table and informed me how the bellini's were made.  It is irritating when the server is not familiar with pretty basic preparation of menu items and is unable to answer the customer intelligently.  We ordered an app, the cilantro/jalapeno/edamame hummus with cucumber, pita bread, and carrots for dipping.  The hummus was completely bland and tasteless (surprisingly, because we thought it would be spicy) and the veggies for dipping were warm and soggy.  Dont order this app.  For our entrees, we ordered a steak salad and the Double D Turkey Burger.  Both were large portions.  Ended up taking half the steak salad home.  The Turkey Burger had a nice flavor.  It was still pink in the middle, but not bad enough to where I wouldve wanted to send it back and wait longer, so I just dealt with it.  The service was slow, but we didnt seem to mind too much because we were chatting away.  After our entrees, the waitress simply dropped the bill off at our table without even asking if we wanted a dessert.  After waiting for her to come back (again) we told her we wanted to order a dessert.  She returns a short while after and tells us the \"kitchen is closed and we couldnt order dessert.\"  WOW, REALLY?  NO?  It's dessert people.  It is not like the cooks are sitting back there \"cooking\" the dessert.  It was clear the waitress just didnt want to try anymore.  We asked to speak to someone else, (manager probably) who, promptly approached our table and asked us what dessert we wanted and of course we could order a dessert.  Again, it is just very irritating to be told \"no\" at a restaurant when you are the paying customer, just because the waitress was too lazy to inquire further about it or simply just to try a little harder to please the customer.  I understand it was a holiday and the restaurant was closing early and everyone working probably wanted to get out of there.  But trust me, there are plenty of other restaurants out there to chose from.  You will likely get treated better, have a wait staff that is actually familiar with menu items, and wont tell you \"no.\""}
{"text":"I recently attended a holiday party at the Daily Dose. Great experience, great food and a very professional staff. I highly recommend using the Daily Dose for your next party!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and the service was inattentive. Mimosa was nice and my kids liked their waffles."}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars from me but about every third time we go the food is bland. It appears to depend on who is in the kitchen. Most times the food is great, the service is always great! Raymond is awesome."}
{"text":"I go to the Daily Dose for breakfast every other month or so. The food and coffee are consistently very good, service friendly and excellent, never too crowded or noisy like a Matt's or Vovomeena, and not over-rated and hyped like the very mediocre Snooze nearby. When old reliables like Over Easy have lost their way and are failing, the Daily Dose remains a reliable go-to for an excellent breakfast"}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the food and service here!!! I would recommend daily dose to anyone. The waffle was AMAZING!!! I was so upset with myself for getting full!!! I wanted to finish the rest so bad!   The vanilla latte was little too foamy but was still good!"}
{"text":"Chorizo omelet was great and my wife liked the turkey sausage omelet  Service was fantastic   The one bad thing was the pancakes  Oooooo the pancakes  Rubbery on the outside soft in the middle  Not a nice golden brown almost like it was rushed  And that's all my kid will eat     Nothing further"}
{"text":"Place clean, staff attentive and courteous,  food always perfect, keep coming back..."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Food was amazing.  Our server adam was great.   Cinnamon pancakes are freaking awesome.  Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Love Daily Dose! We always have great service and delicious food. I had the Mixed Berry Protein Pancakes this morning and they were phenomenal. The server was on top of drinks throughout the meal and everyone enjoyed all of their food. The others at my table had the biscuits and gravy, peanut butter and jelly waffle, strawberry waffle, and Black Forest ham omelette all were delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the DD hash (butternut squash, mushrooms and onions), but everything else is always delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here A LOT. Today I came for lunch and decided to place an order for take out. Usually we go and have NO ISSUES. This time we were practically ignored while waiting for our take out order, which you order from the bar. We ordered two salads which shouldn't have take 35 minutes to get, but it did. The duck dynasty looking dude at the bar who was getting COMPLETELY WASTED and smelled of alcohol when he walked past us was getting better service. PS it was 12:30 when we were there!!! About 5 people who ordered AFTER us were served their food before ours was ready. When we stood there looking at the bartender with the \"where the fuck is our order\" glare she told us it was being \"boxed up now\". 10 minutes later we got our food. I have been there about 6+  times, a few of those were with groups, and I can say I'll never go back. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"Love the corn cakes with chorizo and jalapeño, Yum! This place has a delicious and creative menu."}
{"text":"I had to give it one star to get in here.   It received an 8 on risk factors on the current inspection list.  I have never seen one that bad.   Yikes....."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great all-day breakfast menu, and a great happy hour. I'm constantly drawn back here for an amazing omelette and a fun crowd. It's an amazing location and it has become my go-to spot for lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"As a local place i really want this place to be better than it is. Its decent but cant even say its good. There food is consistently decent never good/great. Service is so inconsistent.  Some servers are great some are simply awful.   I just watched our waitress stop by the table directly next to us 4 times b4 she came back to check how our food was. By the time she came back to check how the food was i was already finished and my plate was taken by the bus boy. Well if you came by earlier you would have know the side of turkey sausage patties was terrible (btw the menu says links). The links use to be some of the best i had, the turkey patties are not even edible.    I may stop in for lunch or dinner when a desperate last minute decision comes up but other than that ive given up on this place. They have gone down hill and fallen off the cliff."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on a Saturday morning.   There was a wait, but they had me seated in under 10 minutes.  Both the service and food was good.  The bloody marie was damn good.   I will be back."}
{"text":"We went at 830 am on Sunday and there was no wait. When we tried to go at 1030 last weekend there was a 25min wait. Early bird does get the worm! I enjoyed the eggs Benedict with Black Forest ham. The breakfast was a large and filling portion. Service was prompt and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Daily Dose serves a bigggg cup of coffee at breakfast, and I love that!  Another thing that really impresses me is that the booths have very high backs, so if you are having a business meeting or a private conversation with a friend, your voices and faces are blocked from most other customers.  The food is good and the menu is varied...healthy choices and the regulars, too.  The service isn't great, but it's very manageable.  The location is great for people who are meeting someone because it is right off the 51 freeway at Camelback.  Give this one a try.  You'll like it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!   They did a perfect job splitting our meal.   Loved our waitress - ask for Monica if you come here."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour prices! I had the nachos and frozen margaritas. So delicious. On Fridays, they have extended happy hour so check it out!"}
{"text":"Really like the patio which I've visited several times. Great menu selections and the food is good. Generally speaking, so is the service. However, this morning one of several dogs on the patio, this one sitting next to me, became easily agitated and began to bark aggressively at other dogs. Though the other dogs would respond in kind, their owners intervened to calm them while the owner of the instigator dog did not. This same dog was raising on hind legs to reach another customer's high bar table. When the dog placed his snout on the edge of my table, I had to ask the owner to keep him away. My complaint with Daily Dose is they did nothing to address the situation for the benefit of myself and my fellow diners. Please next time do something. I would like to come back."}
{"text":"First visit and last visit tonight. Ordered a burger and plate came out with a large hair on it. Ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"I am very lucky to live in the same neighborhood as this place! Without a doubt the food and service are fantastic. After reading some of the reviews I have to say that I'm sure some of the occasional staff may have off days but I highly doubt they have these issues on a regular basis or it would have happened to me. Management staff is also top notch. So are those servers from Minnesota!  Overall my favorite food items to order are the chicken nachos and any of the tacos. I also LOVE their breakfast. If you are unsure about trying out this place then definitely come for breakfast because they really do it right. The turkey sausage omelette is also my favorite but the simple bacon, eggs, and potatoes are also done extremely well for a simple breakfast dish. I am also impressed by the large selection for breakfast. Many places just have a few items and it's nice to mix it up sometimes. Other items that are great include the burgers, salmon, and ribs. One of these days I'm going to get back into the kitchen and figure out how to make that white cilantro jalapeno sauce they put on the nachos. Totally addicting! Now if I could just get one of those TV channels to be changed to Foodnetwork or HGTV I'd probably never leave.   My only request for this location is a big bike rack! We love to ride our cruisers and now is the time of year for folks to be out riding so I don't want to have to turn back if I can't lock up my cruiser."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch here today - I give this place 5 stars!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The place was really cute, contemporary and nice vibe, played a good variety of music.  They have seating in the bar area and a dining area with tables and booths.  I ordered the fried polenta (was OK), roasted veggie grilled cheese w/ sweet potato fries (IT WAS THE BOMB) and I had a pomegranate green tea (THE BEST TEA).  My friend had the panko crust chicken fingers - I had one and it was delish!  For all that, my bill was $15, which is not bad!  Next time we go, we're going to try something else - the menu is great, and they serve breakfast too!  I recommend this place to anyone.  Great food and great service! :)"}
{"text":"Place has always treated my friends and family well.  It has great food, solid bloody Mary's and while service may be spotty here and there, everyone is friendly and like I said - the food is great!  I come here all the time."}
{"text":"Poor poor service! This is the one place were service was cold and food cold as well. Even the manager was cold. I will never come back and this was my first time. I told them and they ask questions like what type of bread, well tell me what types you have and it was a \"sigh fest\" I should have left but I'll spend my money else where!   I'm taking my food to go and no offer of a bag to put the box and 3 condiments in. If there was a zero star I would give that rating,"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning around 11am. The place was pretty busy, but no wait to sit outside on the patio. There was a bit of a wait to sit inside, but I enjoy sitting outside when the temperatures haven't heated up yet. Very friendly service, the server was very prompt, thorough, kept our water replenished and was attentive but not to the point where it was annoying. Really nice. The food isn't life changing but was tasty, good portions and hit the spot. I ordered the chorizo omelet, with potatoes and butternut squash hash. Good. My bf got the turkey omelet and enjoyed it as well.  The parking lot has a bit of construction right now, so it was a little tricky to find parking. This will probably be resolved in the coming months. Another thing I liked about this place was the diverse crowd. (I enjoy people watching.) There is a gym next door so there's a combination of people from the neighborhood, families, young people, and a few post-workout folks. All in all, I would come back :)"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Scottsdale location of this resturant for years and the food there is usually great and so is the service. We were in phoenix recently and we decided to try this location and oh man did we regret it. The food was still good but I can say we had the worst service we have ever had here.   We brought my nephew with us and as we were waing for our waitress go get our drink order he was sitting on my lap almost asleep. When the waitress walked up the first thing she said was \"oh look there is a baby at Myyyy table \" totally deadpan with a mean look in her eyes. What?! We just kind of laughed it off because we thought she may have been trying be funny. He was asleep the rest do the meal. She had an intense scowl on her face the entire time we interacted with her.  The waitress also never refilled our drinks or asked if we needed anything after getting our order. We had to ask other servers walking by even for our bill.  And finally, as were eating we could hear her by the bathrooms (we were in one of the booths) LOUDLY complaining that she just \"wanted to go home\" and that \"we were taking to long\" and that she \"just hoped that we would leave soon\". We only had our food for like 5 minutes at the time! We were really surprised and upset. I could understand it maybe we were being rude or something but we weren't and the place only had two other tables seated so........ I don't even know. We even still left her a tip which looking back I regret now too.   Overall, the food was good but the sevices was just so mean that we would never go back probably not even to the Scottsdale location. We were really uncomfortable and hated the entire experience. No food Is worth it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and ordered the blue crab cake sandwich and a side of some sort of hash, the waitress suggested. The sandwich was awful. Soggy crab cake that had zero flavor. The \"hash\" was a bowl of mush. The kids Mac n cheese that my little man got was better than my whole meal. This place may be good for breakfast but this lunch was a mess of mush. Yuck!"}
{"text":"My girl loves the raspberry/fruity tea drink. I had a great burger the first visit, the fish tacos tasted better than they looked. 2nd visit... chicken nachos tasted fine, but every other chip I pulled off was stale... I mean a chewy tortilla chip is not good. My girl's fish and chips were fine, her dipping sauce was great. We'll go back for happy hour, for the lower prices."}
{"text":"I took my 3 year old for brunch after an appt I had. It was a nice place and loved how it had brunch items. My daughter had the kids meal starter and it was plenty! I had a full Cobb salad and that was plenty. I only gave it 4 stars only because I was not satisfied with the bloody mary. It wasn't dressed like how I would think it be...it wasn't as tasteful as I had hoped. I had to add salt and pepper to mine. To me it tasted like tomato juice with a chipotle like vodka or something.  Other than that, the food was quite delicious, service was superb and I would visit again....Maybe I'll try the Mimosa next time!"}
{"text":"So good. First time here. Wait was 10 minutes.  I had the eggs benedict, DD style, with turkey sausage, and the DD hash. My husband had the chili verde omelette.  Everything is made in house and fresh. Loved the house made raspberry jam. Try it! You will love the place."}
{"text":"Had my doubts as another douche hangout, but it was a great mix of people from the neighborhood on a Saturday AM.Small patio, but looks really nice. We got seated quickly inside. and placed our drink orders with our young new waitress.    We asked what she recommended and she gave us a pretty good lowdown. The Mrs had the breakfast nachos and I had the french toast. The nachos came out huge and full of taste. The french toast looked small when it cam out, but once you dig in, the richness fills ya. So good! She shared and had a great breakfast.  Good coffee, good service and good food. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have been to the Daily Dose 4 times in the last couple of months.  The bottom line is that the food and the service are two completely different things.  On the positive side, the food is very good.  However, I don't think I have seen one employee that actually looked happy to be there...not one.  I feel like I am putting people out anytime I am asking them to do anything for me.  And follow up to find out if your meal is good...a rarity."}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out! Been to Daily Dose three times with the hope of having a better experience.  The service is poor, the wait time is long and the food is nothing to rave about.  On two occasions the food was cold.  Many other better options in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the breakfast nachos were delicious!!! Just perfect. The chips fresh and crispy enough, the mix of flavors... great! Coffee is also full of flavor and the mimosas were generous poured. Customer service was on point with our server Kegan. By the way, we tried going to Snooze before coming here. Place was packed and we were starving. Daily Dose is right around the corner, and let me tell ya, I thought this was way better than Snooze. Customer service, food and coffee... hands down better."}
{"text":"Don't wait in line at Snooze, go to Daily Dose.  It was not crowded at 10:30 am, super clean, wonderful protein pancakes which were enough for a meal later, great service from Vicki!  and breakfast served until 4!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great and kind of flavorless and the service wasn't that great either. I got the bacon omelet which was okay but nothing special and a side of corn beef hash that needed a lot of hot sauce for a flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fantastic! Best food and drink selections for a GREAT price!"}
{"text":"Tried to order here from Postmates; after a half hour of waiting (after the order said it was accepted and ready) the Postmates driver called and said they don't deal with or take orders from Postmates... Makes no sense to me.  If someone wanted to walk into my restaurant and spend $80 on food I'd let them.  Guess they lost a sale (and all future sales) since I order and use Postmates for meals all the time."}
{"text":"I only gave this restaurant one star for the following reasons: The front hostess was so blaze as if she could not care less whether we were there or not.  No welcome, no Good Morning. She walked past tables for two and seated us next to the kitchen.  We were tired so we kept the table.  Servers walking toward the kitchen yelled orders 10 feet  before they got to the kitchen.  When was asked for water rather than coffee, our server looked crest fallen.  It took forever to get our order, 20 minutes.  We ordered basic breakfasts, nothing special.  A table was seated after we placed our order.  She got her breakfast within minutes.  We still waited.  We asked several times where our order was.  The same apology came and we were told it was on the way.  While we were waiting, we saw a server drop a napkin roll of utensils on the floor under a table.  He picked it up and put it right on the table.  Who ever uses it will be wiping their mouth with a napkin that rolled under a table where people put their dirty feet. The food was just OK, nothing special. Granted we were a little creeped out by the  dirty napkin put on the table.  The check came in the usual black holder which was covered in greasy fingerprints."}
{"text":"Genuine friendly service and greet menu! :) :) Nice casual environment for a laid back lunch or casual bite."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Food is good. Beer selection lovely. Skip the berry pancake for breakfast way too much carbs; could not finish it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Came here twice on my 4 day trip in town. The hamburgers were fantastic topped with bacon and cheese. Sweet potato fries were very good but too salty.   My breakfast experience was even better. I ordered the protein pancakes with hash browns and a side of bacon. The bacon was cooked perfect, not too dry or soft. Very meaty and not much fat. The pancakes were likely the best I've ever eaten. Stuffed with fruit and flax seeds, they were delicious. Needless to say, I ate my entire meal. The server commented that it's very rare to eat the entire meal so it's just proof that it was good."}
{"text":"The food is bomb here. Our hostess is super nice. Think her name is Lisa. I'm really bad with names. Blue lipstick and very attentive. Not from Arizona and got lucky we found this place. Really recommend it. Protein Bowl is very satisfying. Thank you Lisa for the recommendation."}
{"text":"What a great spot! I was just looking for a quick spot for a working lunch, and this certainly fit the bill.  Food was unique, healthy and hearty.  Service was quick and friendly.  Great beer selection.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews at a glance are mediocre. I love coming here for breakfast, specifically for their eggs benedict. I have really quick and simple service when I sit at the bar. The servings are huge so I always share.  I haven't gotten to come on a day to enjoy their morning drink menu that's on my to-do list.  I have come for dinner-- most of what I had was pretty forgettable (their dinner menu is kinda blah), but the soft pretzel style burger bun was delicious. i recall the happy hour being fairly good, too.  Give it a shot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I am now a regular at daily dose both for breakfast & lunch. Perfect for all types of occasions & appetites. All of the food is made in house, they have a nice variety on the healthy side, truly savory options for the not so healthy side ;) I highly recommend the banana bread French toast, it's incredible & not too sweet at all! I love the unique DD hash as a side dish; butternut squash, onion, potato and light seasoning = heavenly. Also recommend the Eggs Benedict & NEW BBQ sandwich melt, even their side salads are a generous portion & very fresh! I've met friends for brunch (mimosas & bloody Mary's are great) & even brought my dog on the side patio for a quick bite. You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"These guys are doing a pretty good job, the coffee was great (and served in a giant cup). I had a waffle some turkey sausage and 3 eggs. Turkey sausage was very forgettable, the waffle was good, and the eggs were not cooked correctly for over medium. It is in kind of a weird spot a little off the beaten path, but they keep it rocking for Sunday lunch/brunch. I have been to the one in old town and had the breakfast nachos and was excited to try this location. I plan on heading back and taking another shot at something a little more daring on the menu next time. I will say this, their DD left me wishing I had the cottage cheese."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have visited this location the past two Saturdays in a row. We had the same server both times (she even remembered us). The food is delicious and the bloody mary's are the main reason why we go! They serve them in a pint glass and not the smaller glasses that some other brunch places in the area offer. The portions are pretty large and Ive had to take leftovers home both times. Favorites are the flannel hash and the biscuits and gravy. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We were very happy with our meal here!! Our server, Amanda, went out of her way to make sure our experience was a great one. We both had omelettes and loved them! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is not your gourmet meal but is a standard default for unpretentious large portions of goodness.  The wait is never long.  The waitresses regularly checks on you but not so often that you feel constantly interrupted.  This review is solely on breakfast/brunch.  There are so many dishes to choose from.  I would recommend the prime rib omelet, the crabby omelet, the egg white choices, hangover breakfast sandwich and the biscuits and gravy.  I'm a huge fan of corned beef hash but I wouldn't recommend it here.  Maybe it just doesn't suit my savory taste buds but I don't like my meat sweet.  It might be the southwestern style but I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Really yummy food! I will defintiely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and we enjoyed it. The food was good. I liked the outdoor seating and I am looking forward to trying it for brunch!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of state, were looking for something local and not the usual, so we stopped in. What a pleasant food and social experience, entire staff were friendly, and service was great. We would love to become regulars."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations just going in: this looks revolting from the outside. I was quite surprised by the indoors, however. Very swanky and clean! Modern! Nice lighting.   The good: The dining room. Already went over that. Honorable mention: The service. Our server was quick, attentive and kind.   The bad: The food. I had the green chili chicken enchiladas. Horrifically over seasoned! Every bite was like trying to swallow a forkful of pepper. The enchiladas sat in my stomach like a pair of squeamish bricks that are too afraid to touch each other. Very unsettling.   On way out, I had the chance to get a good look at the kitchen area. Not the cleanest kitchen in the world, people. And one of the prep cooks was chewing gum. Unacceptable.    I should have followed my gut instinct and stayed away from this oh-too-familiar bar food cuisine. That's what I get for trying something I was leery about to begin with! I ate over six hours ago and my stomach is still hating me.   The two stars are for the cleanliness (of the dining room ONLY) and for the servers."}
{"text":"Lots of food for your buck, tasted great and the staff was very friendly. We came out of there stuffed full. We were impressed."}
{"text":"So amazing! #Paleo Substitute DD Hash for the potatoes the hash is made with squash mushrooms and onions and it is so good you won't believe it! Fresh Squeezed OJ? Yes Please! Of course the have toast and pancakes for you grain eaters and I  am sure they are as good as the many gluten free options!"}
{"text":"BLAND food and poor service.  I've tried four different dishes, an been disappointed every time.  To make things worse, the service was insulting (and I believe our server was a manager) I wont be returning, but Im rooting from them; hopefully they can turn it around."}
{"text":"Ambiance: much better than I expected since you really can't tell what it looks like from outside except for the patio. Nice booths and overhead lighting. We were at a table and I was surprised by how busy it was in here.  Food: I had the Rueben sandwich with apple sauerkraut. I asked the server before ordering it if it was grilled; she said it was. It was definitely not grilled, but rather between two pieces of marble rye toast. The overall flavor was nice: corned beef was well seasoned, the sauerkraut was sweet and tangy, and the sauce was nice, but I wanted more. The cheese, if there was any (I couldn't tell), was paltry. Those that know this sandwich know that it is like a grilled cheese with corned beef, sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing. But this one at least had a nice twist with some green chiles. The fries were pretty good, too.  Service: our server was very sweet and efficient.   I may come back and give it another shot because it is close by.  That will determine whether   I keep this rating or change it. I usually either really like or hate a place and this place was neither good or bad."}
{"text":"Great everything they need longer hours of operation! I've tried to go there for the last two weeks and they close at 3 PM! This is not helpful for people who drive forever far and then have to wait an hour for a table! NEEDS TO STAY OPEN LONGER TO SERVICE EVERYONE! SOO STAY IN LINE OR DONT BOTHER DRIVING FAR TO GO THERE! You will most likely not be sat down and leave! This place WAS AMAZING UNTIL THEIR SECRET GOT OUT NOW THEY SEEM TO NOT CARE IF EVERYONE GETS SERVICED! Most awful experience ever' when I called to confirm both locations had the same hrs the woman on the phone said \"yes, sorry!\" then proceeded to hang up the phone. I'm terribly depressed on the snide treatment; that's managed to happen to my favorite go to brunch spot! Sucks to say this post is sad but true! I wish everyone a better experience than I've had as of recent this has been two wkends in a row"}
{"text":"I had been to the daily dose in Scottsdale, so I thought I would give this place a try for lunch while I was passing through Phoenix. Despite what other reviewers have had to say, I actually thought the service here was great. It was Labor Day, so I think it was a little busier than usual, but we were seated within 15 minutes. We ordered The eggs Benedict, one turkey sausage and the other with the crabcake  (which was interesting but good). We also tried the banana bread French toast.... Which was delicious. They use fresh banana bread, and it tasted almost like a dessert! Definitely will be back again"}
{"text":"Nice little spot near frys.  I've tried it twice for breakfast. Nothing that special but then again it's nice and safe for a meeting or work breakfast.  Last time I went for a meeting and our server was fine but she did not seem like a happy person.  Usually business will strive if they have employees who enjoy being around people.  Also one of my colleagues asked for a diet coke mid meal... And then she asked 2 other random people after a while and then those people sent our server back over to ask if she can get us anything.  Why did they not just tell her to bring a damn diet coke????  So my friend is like A DIET COKE please.  If the servers could work as a team and help each other out for the good of the customer it would benefit the customer and business for sure.  I felt bad for our server because she has no help!"}
{"text":"this is really close to where we live, so it's a nice place to drop in for a snack and/or drink. their shrimp cocktail (mexican style) was very yummy. they've got a decent happy hour...they have something against corn tortillas (there are reportedly none in the building. ever.)  my biggest problem with this place is that it feels so canned and corporate. given the option, i'd probably pick somewhere else.  they do have a steak salad that i found pretty impressive...but unless you just worship onions or are planning on being alone for an extended period of time after eating, ask them to reduce/minimize/delete them from the dish. i forgot to do that once and lived to regret it."}
{"text":"I am usually a Daily Dose lover and have been to multiple DD locations. This past Saturday I went to the Highland location for brunch with some friends, as it is near my home. I had the Egg White Wrap, and unfortunately got a terrible case of food poisoning from it later that day. When I called on Sunday just to let the restaurant know, I was told by the person I spoke with on the phone that they hadn't heard that from anyone else yet (mind you it was early Sunday morning), and that he appreciated my \"feedback\". I am pretty sure calling a restaurant to let them know I received food poisoning from eating at their establishment does not fall into the feedback category usually associated with service, etc. Needless to say I was very disappointed in their utter disregard to my phone call and their dis concern for their patron's health. I will not be back to DD again and will definitely be telling all my friends and family to avoid the Highland location!"}
{"text":"I love Daily Dose! This tends to be a great go-to spot for lunch meetings and really any business lunches. The food comes out pretty quickly so if you're in a time crunch you don't have to worry here.  I have never had to wait for seating, and I love how they have a nice patio to also eat on when the weather is nice.   Service is hit or miss...it is usually either really great, or just the opposite (although I think I have had much more great service than bad service).  I love the gourmet coffee drinks on the menu and they even carry coconut oil to add a splash of flavor and nutrition to your coffee.   I usually order the portobello mushroom with egg whites and fruit on the side...it sounds boring but they do a great job spicing it up and it is more then enough food without the guilt of going overboard on brunch!  *Side note - they do carry gluten free bread here which is a major plus in my book! And it doesn't fall apart when you pick it up! ;)  I recommend Daily Dose for breakfast, brunch, lunch, business meetings, etc!"}
{"text":"I food was excellent. The service, wasnt so good. Ask to ask several times for jelly, lemons, napkins & warm syrup."}
{"text":"I want so much to love the Daily Dose.  It is in the perfect location for me to make it my go-to spot for weekend brunches.  But I just can't get 100% behind it.  Every time I'm there, I search the extensive menu over and over again for something that jumps out at me.  But every time, I find myself at a loss and just ordering an omelette or french toast or something equally banal.  I'll keep searching, but with every trip my hope dwindles."}
{"text":"Service and a big selection of food is fabulous! I've been there only 3 times meeting friends who live in the far west and far east, and each time I saw many people from business offices and drop-ins come to lunch there on Highland and 51. I haven't tried the one in Scottsdale where I live. A must try!"}
{"text":"My boss and I went there for lunch as we were getting our job trucks washed at a nearby car wash.  we looked up on the internet nearby bar and grills and this place showed up.  A bit of a disappointment as far as a bar and grill, but as far as the food goes, very good.    When we first walked in we did not see a hostess or a sign that stated please wait to be seated, so we took it upon ourselves to sit where ever.  We were then met by someone that asked if we were being helped and we said no.  She said we normally have a hostess, but she was no where to be found.  We both thought that the person that greeted us had a bit of an attitude?    Our waitress, she had a great attitude and made our stay very entertaining."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place is still in business. This place has so much potential, a nice location and great design. But the service is horrible and the food reminds me of Applebee's.  I was sat on the patio in the dark (lights didn't come on for another 15 minutes) and waited for the server to come by and greet me. Then I waited some more. Finally after 10 min I flagged down a busser to look for him. I could understand if the restaurant was packed but there were only about 8 tables in the whole restaurant and a full wait staff. The server had NO knowledge of the wine list or drink menu. And it took me another 5 minutes to get my coctail and a glass of water.  He knew even less about the menu. Put int he wrong order for the table, but the food actually come out at a decent ticket time even if it was only 1/2 of what the table ordered. The food was just ok, presentaition was pretty decent but there was NO FLAVOR. The server didn't even come by to check on us, so I had to flag another food runner to get the rest of what we had ordered. (I don't know why I even bothered.)  I could stand mediocre food for great service. Likewise, I could stand shoddy service for great food. But this place is hopeless. I thought after being open for a few months they might have worked out a lot of their kinks. Obviously they have a very long way to go."}
{"text":"Moves to Chandler AZ  few weeks ago,  still  not really know my  ways around  and  where to go. a friend take me to Daily dose this morning  ,   and  the food was Fantastic  ,  i  had a Omelet ,  it  was great  , the service was fantastic ,   i will definitely  keep go there as well.   i also hear that they have another place in Scottsdale  AZ  ,  so i will  go there next time to try.  Great Food !!!"}
{"text":"Great quality  breakfast at a great cost. My husband and I normaly go to the Scottsdale location but decided to check it out since we were in the neighborhood. I had a chocholate covered strawberry pancake, daily dose hash and turkey sausage (all ala cart). Yummy! I even enjoyed the water with a slice of cucumber. Refreshing. This location is much larger than Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I like this place.  We sat on the patio and had lunch. I have been to the other location several times for breakfast and dinner.  I had the steak salad and it was good.  I would have preferred just a bit more dressing but I would rather it be sparse then to much. One companion had the chicken nachos. They were huge and tasty.  The other companion had a burger.  He seemed to like it.  We had no issues with service or food so they must of worked the kinks out based on earlier reviews."}
{"text":"The service is terrific and I truly felt at home! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My first visit here I had the hangover sandwich... WOW! I was hooked immediately. The Daily Dose Burger is always prepared to my liking, the Prime Steak Salad is a huge salad and is a delight to my tastebuds! I would stay away from the gravy, it's not what you'd expect from breakfast gravy. The staff is quick, friendly, and on top of their game. I will visit here again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch around 1030 on a Saturday, and the wait was only about 15 minutes! Pretty short compared to other places in the area!   I had the breakfast nachos which were delicious. Has egg and chorizo, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, and I added a side of guacamole. The chorizo and salsa is what made the dish.  They've got a large selection of breakfast and lunch items, so I definitely need to come back to try more.   The customer service here is awesome. My mom has to adhere to a gluten free diet, and they're extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about what people with diet restrictions should/shouldn't eat.   On top of all that, our waitress-Stephanie-went above and beyond for us. She recommended a dish for my mom, and when it came out, the pancakes were too salty. So Stephanie took the food back to the kitchen without question, and recooked her order. But before she brought out the new food, the chef made a new batch of batter and had her try it to make sure it tasted right before now bringing it the order to my mom. Now if that's not customer service at its finest, idk what is.   Highly impressed, glad we came here for brunch."}
{"text":"I love coming here! It's nice to find a dog friendly patio in the mid-town area. I'm sad that the hours changed, since the few times I've been here were for dinner. Food is tasty, drink specials are good, & have always enjoyed the service!"}
{"text":"You can tell they just opened, but the employees and management were all working hard trying to get their system down.  Just like the Scottsdale location, the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Tip, arrive early because they are always busy especially on weekends! You will likely wait but it is worth it. They have a large healthy portion of the menu but after a late night out that was not in our cards this morning! Refreshing cucumber water and full bar.  Two favorites \"crabby\" omelette, fluffy omelette with crab cakes and spinach and Breakfast Nachos OMG it is so good in a bad way, a Mount Vesuvius size pile of chips with two types of cheese sauce, scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, jalapeños and chorizo, I am not a fan of chorizo so I opted out of it they were really nice offering to substitute another meat instead to which I declined but I appreciate the offer.  To top this sinful splurge off what do they bring you to dip your nachos in?? Gravy ! I feel the need to visit a cardiologist but I have no regrets in this occasional splurge FYI it is so big it will probably be 2 or 3 meals for you.  Staff is attentive and friendly, don't let the crowds standing outside intimidate you just allow for some time."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast places are First Watch and Daily Dose.  I love them equally the same.  When I want a boozy brunch I go to Daily Dose.  When I want a nice, hearty, extra healthy brunch or breakfast I opt for First Watch.  Any who .... I've been to Daily Dose more times than I can count.  Doesn't matter if I'm dining with 1 other person or 4, there's always a small wait.  No longer than 10 - 15 minutes.  If you're alone, you can definitely find a seat at the bar. The omelets looks delicious.  I've honestly never tried them only because they're made with 3 eggs and 3 egg omelets are way too much for me.  I've tried the Steak & Potato Bowl and the Turkey Sausage & Polenta Bowl.  Those two are my favorites.  Along with the biscuits and gravy, banana bread French toast and the Southwest Wrap.  I've ordered those things over and over again ... never get tired.    I branched out recently and ordered Steak & Eggs, fried eggs with herb potatoes and a biscuit.  I ordered my steak medium.  I received a very well steak.  I sent it back.  The server was very apologetic.  Because my friend and I had plenty of Mimosas and plenty of other food to eat I didn't mind waiting for the steak.  The manager (I believe) was kind enough to bring the steak out to me himself once it was ready. It was juicy, cooked perfectly and sooooo tasty.  I enjoyed it and I'm adding it to my list of favorite Daily Dose dishes"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They have a huge selection of food and drinks (alcoholic and non). They have a wonderful patio that is great for the cooler months! I love the variety of items available and the service is always great."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the camelback corridor dining scene. Went with a group of 5 and we all had a hard time choosing between so many good options. I had the signature burger with Harissa aioli on a pretzel bun--moist, juicy, and full of flavor. And I snagged a bite of the hangover cure breakfast sandwich, which was also good. The space was upscale contemporary if a bit too corporate Starbucks-ish for my tastes, but what it lacked in character it made up for with good food and friendly service. Definitely recommended as a solid neighborhood haunt."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Not horrible but would not come back.    Waffles were way too dense.   Like eating bricks.    Service was just OK."}
{"text":"First time we went on a Tuesday we had great service. Just left on Sunday and service was horrible. The two bartenders were gabbing and socializing so much the customers were ignored. Food is always good but won't be running back as there are so many good breakfast places around."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary is a little on the watery side, but good and spicy!  I come here for the breakfast nachos! Can't go wrong with those!"}
{"text":"Get beyond the pancakes, eggs and bacon. Have the chorizo + jalapeño corn cakes! Add a medium well egg to the top and a bit of syrup. You won't regret it! Sweet. Savory. Spicy. Then sweet again. Order a glass of milk :) What a delicious breakfast adventure this dish is!!"}
{"text":"Went to Daily Dose this afternoon for lunch, although we all ended up getting breakfast.  Definitely understand why it is SO much busier in the earlier hours of the day. The breakfast is AMAZING! I could have eaten everyone's meals. I go the Hangover Sandwich-perfect.  The service was also great. They offer a 50% discount to military, but only when in uniform. My husband is military and since it is Memorial day they still took half off the ENTIRE bill for 4 people.  Top notch place."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. Ya know those restaurants that are just trying too hard to be trendy and end up throwing all sorts of weird shit on your plate because it looks pretty but tastes like hay? This is one of those places.   Too much to complain about but myself and 3 others came in, spent 45 minutes waiting for lunch and we all didn't like what we received."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, fast service, friendly staff, very good prices! Their OJ is delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Tara was a great server!  AC needs to be turned lower. Our group of 5 was very hot. Waiter at next table sweating pretty much the entire time we were there. Come here often and first time we had this issue. We definitely will return and not let this deter us."}
{"text":"*Daily Dose Midtown*  Me and a friend had finished our meals and had stayed around to continue in conversation.  We were sitting outside and the weather is nice today so we stayed a while longer. After refilling our water 2 times our waiter (Jesse) comes back as ask us if we could leave (is in he was kicking us out) because it was picking up and the restaurant had started to form a line.... Without fuss I complied and stood up and as I was leaving a nearby couple had asked me if he (the waiter) just asked us to leave... I told them yes.   I do not know if that was proper protocol but I must say ... I feel extremely embarrassed, appalled and disrespected. I enjoy the Daily Dose for its food and atmosphere and have come here on multiple occasions and truly loved everything about it. I'm able to separate this experience from those but this none the less is not becoming of a establishment I enjoyed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get breakfast. The staff is awesome, food is great and it won't kill the pockets! now I need to try something off the Lunch and Dinner Menu!"}
{"text":"Good food, great mimosas and you must try the breakfast nachos! We have been here on a few occasions, every item we have orderd has been delicious! We visit during the week with co-workers and never have to wait for a table and service is great."}
{"text":"Ok.. over all review is a 3.. this visit is a 1 for the fact that it is colder in here than the 36 degrees outside!  Ask if the heat was on and they said it was on.  OK, it's not though. It's like eating In a refridgerator.  Oh please let my food stay warm enough to eat while they carry it to the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving breakfast. We had heard good things about Snooze and wanted to try there, but when we went there we were told that the wait is over an hour. I understand that breakfast places are super popular, but who actually wants to wait over an hour to eat?  So we decided to try our luck elsewhere. This brought us to the Daily Dose. We were promptly seated and our server was over in a timely manner. We order the quesadilla, portabella mushroom (breakfast menu), and the turkey omelet. The food was delicious! We had so much left over, we were able to have breakfast the next day.   It seems like the Daily Dose has a lot of different drink specials.. we didn't try them since we were craving coffees, but I would like to go back to check them out.   Overall I highly recommend Daily Dose.. I'm not sure I will try to go back to Snooze since I know that there is a great breakfast place down the street that doesn't make you wait over an hour."}
{"text":"First time here and didn't disappoint. Don't let the people waiting to be seated turn you away; it's worth the wait! Excellent service and food. My eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was delightful. The hollandaise sauce just right, not to heavy but creamy and tasty. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a spicy Clamato Bloody Mary. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having Easter breakfast with the family. Great service, food, and atmosphere. Our waitress, Susan, was such a doll and very accommodating. We will make a spot for this place on our breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Good location. Great breakfast menu and drink menu. Is starting to become my \"come to\" spot for a bloody and breakfast."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a casual lunch and service was great.  Solid menu and the southwest wrap was awesome. Really quick to get our food!"}
{"text":"I bring my kids in a lot, the bacon is on point and so are the Chelada's. The service on ordering a drink is always slow unless you are sitting at the bar. It is slow drink service at all locations."}
{"text":"Great menu! Has any breakfast food you could want (omelets, biscuits and gravy, fun pancakes, bowls, sandwiches, etc.)! Enjoyed sitting on the outside covered patio and service was great!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food and Great service from Samantha S.  Note to cook: please add more lemon to the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict.  Diane N."}
{"text":"The Little details are what count the most. I brought my little dog so we had to sit on the patio, immediately they brought a bowl of water and a milk bone, so it started off very well. It's January so it was  a bit chilly they had heaters and clear curtains that they put down for us.   We ordered the bacon bloody, which had too many little bacon bits for my liking, and the cucumber vodka bloody and that was just alright. We waited for awhile for breakfast to come (everyone else that got sat after us had gotten their food) and then Stephanie, our server, apologized immensely and said she forgot to order our food. We understand but were surprised when we got our bill and they had still charged us for everything. We had 2 omelets and a half of a french toast, I thought for sure they'd take the French toast off for the mishap."}
{"text":"Service was very fast and food was awesome. Not packed like the Scottsdale location, take advantage early."}
{"text":"Just dropped in and decided to try this place out for breakfast. It was a good decision for this Friday morning. The naked pan cakes hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The service was friendly, but my drink went empty for a little too long. The burger looked and tasted like a frozen bland patty. I have made better ones at home. Shoot some fast food places make better tasting ones. $13 for bland burger and fries and drink? Although the fries were pretty good. I'll pass overall thank you!"}
{"text":"Breakfast nachos are ridiculous (in a good way)! If you like lots of meat and cheese, you should get them. I've had a few different pancake/waffle options, and they are all so yummy! Service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"Not once has there been a time were I have been disappointed by their food or service. Their menu is nice and far from the usual dull breakfast norms. They are constantly checking back to see how you are doing and for refills and the size of the plates are pretty big."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices! Excellent for brunch but get here early! We like to come and sit at the bar. This time I got the crabby omelet, biscuits and gravy, and a waffle. They were all excellent. I highly recommend the double mimosa too ;)"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Our new favorite restaurant!! Just tried it for the first time last Wednesday morning. The Sweet Roll Pancakes on their menu had my interest.  They greeted us with huge smiles and sat us is a very comfortable booth. Two servers tended to us... Kegan and Sass. Wow!!! They are the best.  I had to try the Sweet Roll Pancake..OMG AGAIN!!! I cannot even describe the \"yummyness\"!! It is a melt-in-your-mouth experience. Good God!! Please try it. It is soooooo good.  And everything was good. You will soon have a new favorite restaurant too. We returned back on Saturday with some new friends to show them what a great place Daily Dose is! Equally as excellent. We are taking friends next Sunday too - they will love it.  10 STARS!  \"The Breakfast Yelper's Crew\""}
{"text":"The Happy Hour menu has changed.  Our favorite foods are gone!  Happy hour ends at 7:30 and I swear it used to last until 8.  We were so sad to see the changes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. A regular for visiting when in town. Good flavors and service. Nice staff"}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with any Daily Dose location. For a Saturday around brunch time, we got seated within 5 minutes indoors. Server was very attentive even though it was busy in her section. She was very friendly and on top of refills and checking in on us. Food is always pretty good no matter what you get here."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers to Daily Dose simply because we've never had bad service or food! We sat at the bar and had excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The midtown location continues to disappoint with their lack of customer service! We sat for 15 minutes waiting for a server and when she arrived she was not at all apologetic. In fact she asked if we needed more time when we hadn't even gotten water!! Then the food took forever...how long does it take to cook 2 eggs over easy!!  Last time I'm coming here!!"}
{"text":"Heard and read about this place a lot before I finally got the chance to pop in. Came last week during my lunch break and my only complaint was not being able to indulge in happy hour and try any of the cocktails (don't think the boss would approve). So I settled for the Caprese Grilled Cheese with a side of Sweet Potato Fries and the waitress so kindly made me an iced chai latte though it was listed as a hot drink only.  Everything was TASTY and the menu is huge. There are so many options to choose from - this is definitely one of those places you have to visit multiple times to not only try breakfast, lunch, AND dinner, but all the different dishes they offer for EACH of those courses.   As Arnold would say, I'll be bach.*     *Austrian pronunciation for \"back.\""}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a chance since the reviews have gone up to a 4* average. Don't be fooled! Nothing the other diners around us looked very good so we decided to try other items. I had the huevos ranchers which was more like two eggs on top of a bean soup and had a folded flour tortilla on the side. I put all the jalapeños on, the salsa they provided, and many shots of cholula and it was still flavorless. My partner had a turkey sausage and egg white scramble with toast and a bowl of fruit. His response was \"we chose the worst place for breakfast in the city\". On a positive note, the service was good and refills on the drinks kept coming!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while planning my trip..Talk about bang for your buck. With the recent trend of fancy brunch spots this place keeps it real. Good food and plenty of it at a reasonable price. I had the crabby omelette (2crab cakes on top of a fluffy omelette, with roasted potatoes, a bowl of fresh fruit,  & sourdough toast for $12. Mimosas were perfect champagne with a splash of fresh orange juice. There's no way I could get this much food where I'm from under $20. I couldn't eat it all."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are huge. The tempeh & grains omelet was one of the best ones I've had. It was deliciously amazing! I had some sort of hash, I think the server called it a butternut squash hash, I could be wrong but whatever it was it complimented my meal well. I was so full off of those two items I couldn't enjoy my potatoes that came with the meal. Great bang for your buck! The next time I'm in Arizona, I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The staff was super on their game and the wait wasn't bad at all. The food was fabulous. Love it."}
{"text":"Super good I had the flannel hash and didn't leave a piece on the place I would recommend and bring the kids also"}
{"text":"I go here for just one reason.  The banana bread french toast.   Only this time it was different.  In the past, the banana bread was banana bread.   You know, like a real thick, soft piece of proper cake, but banana.  This time the banana bread was bread.  You know, like the stuff you make sandwiches out of.  Kinda tough and chewy and dry.   This totally changes the dish.  I don't know if it's a one off or something that they modified with their recipe.  I'll try it once more.  If it's still dry and bland, I won't be coming back.   (after all, that's why I come here!)"}
{"text":"Do not eat the fruit.  First time I found a hair.  Second time I found a beatle.  There won't be a third time."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place and the breakfast is phenomenal! Both times I've gotten the Turkey Sausage Omelette with the DD Hash and a side pancake. The portions are large and the pancakes are huge so no need to order more than one. I've also tried the mimosas once and I wasn't too much of a fan of them but the coffee is great!!! They also offer complimentary coffee while you wait to be seated that's pretty good stuff.   This place is also great for large groups. There is a nice patio area with misters and a nice size dinning area. I haven't been here for lunch or dinner but there is a nice size bar with a couple of 32in TVs. So not the place to come to watch a game but that's what sports bars are for anyway. This place is know for there breakfast and there is a good reason for that just look at my pic."}
{"text":"Daily rocks!       Best Banana Nut French Toast ever. If God made anything better he kept it for himself.     Came during lunch and wanted Crab Cakes, but they weren't on the \"lunch\" menu, BUT the amazing bartender (Drea) hooked me up and they were amazing.       The patio is amazing this time of year. Check them out you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Took a friend there for lunch. Terrible experience. We received the wrong order. No real apology. Tried to fix things. Didn't really do that. No offer to assist with a discount or added item. Nothing. Server seemed more interested in helping people having alcohol rather than us. Server was grabbing lemon wedges from the container. Pare hands. Touching and putting them back. Hands not clean. Do not get a lemon with you're tea. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place for breakfast. They have everything from super healthy options to s'mores French toast. The outdoor patio is small but covered and really nice. I have always had great service and great food. I plan to get here soon for lunch to see if it can match breakfast! Definitely recommend if you have family or friends in town."}
{"text":"Food is good, location is great if you live in the area. Service has been hit or miss. One time no wait by the door, made eye contact with 2 servers and my husband and I waited at the door/hostess stand for 15-20 mins to be seated and said screw it--- left and ate elsewhere. This was on a weekday evening so no chance of special event, and past happy hour. Only disappointing experience. But try the breakfast nachos if you like hearty/savory breakfast options."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Although I enjoy everything I have tried. If you like Breakfast Club at Cityscape you will love Daily Dose!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and make it a point to come here at least once every time we're in the area. Food here is normally pretty good. I've been here a handful of times. Can't complain about that part. There's 2 things I wish I would've known before for this particular visit. 1, their specialty coffee drinks really aren't that good so save your money on that. 2, their new menu (or maybe it's their breakfast menu layout) is misleading in my opinion. I went to particularly order gluten free food and ordered a breakfast burger. To my dismay, when the burger arrived it didn't have a gluten free bun, to which I ordered. It arrived on 2 pieces of gluten free bread. I asked the manager that happened who just happened to walk by and he informed me that they no longer have gluten free buns just the gluten bread. Well, then remove it from the menu please. That's misleading and causes frustration for me who didn't know that upon ordering. The other issue I have within their menu is on the breakfast burger I ordered it says \"pick a side\" so I tried to pick a side from their side menu. The waitress (not her fault) informs me that the waffle I wanted was $5 extra. BUT it's in the sides menu and it's a side. Shouldn't it be an option without an extra cost?  The menu doesn't say or restrict otherwise (from what I recall) it literally just says pick a side. So naturally, I look for a sides menu. And think I have free choice because it doesn't say otherwise.  I'm sure I'll be back again. But I'll be more cautious to ask those things."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: the happy hour drinks and the patio are pretty freaking awesome.   The bad: Ordered the turkey burger because the waitress highly recommended it. I love turkey burgers, so I was SUPER excited. She promised that it was like omg SO good. It wasn't. It was horrible.  I am convinced that they were trying to get rid of soon to be expiring turkey or that she gets some kind of turkey burger bonus.   The ugly: we ordered nachos for the table.  They brought the nachos out and we started eating. They came back a few minutes later and said that our plate was actually a special order for another table.  THEY TOOK OUR PARTIALLY EATEN PLATE OF NACOS AND GAVE THEM TO THE RIGHT TABLE.  I wish I was kidding but thIs actually happened. You could tell that our plate had been picked at as well.    That has to be the craziest thing that's ever happened to me at a restaurant.  None of us could believe that happened.  So gross."}
{"text":"I would say the Daily Dose has a better selection and better tasting gluten free options on their menu than Snooze, or another other AM eatery.  My favorite breakfast from here is any of the delicious, sweet dessert pancakes sided with some of their stunningly addictive squash hash, and fatty bacon. My mom loves the peach pancakes. I also prefer their corn beef hash to any other restaurant, although I've always found corn beef hashes to be salty if they are not homemade.  An excellent breakfast place for those looking to taste food that is gluten free but impossible to tell!"}
{"text":"Several friends and I met here for Sunday brunch and it was an overall pleasant experience. Cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff, and the crispy polenta with poached egg and poblano that I ordered was very good. Because we were a larger group that came late morning on a Sunday, there was a rather lengthy wait but that is not unexpected for a popular brunch joint."}
{"text":"Brought my Sister and her friend from Illinois here for a late breakfast/lunch. The staff was on point and the food is all recieved from local farms as much as possible. Ruben was out of this world.. OMG so good.."}
{"text":"It looks like a lot of the higher reviews are for breakfast. So maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I will never know because I wont be back.  I've been here twice for dinner and was not impressed. The first time I tried the mahi sandwich with a side salad. The flavor was good, nice ingredients like avocado and bacon, but the fish was overcooked. I tried to power through because I enjoyed the flavor, but just couldn't get past the rubbery, chewy fish. I ended up just pulling the fish off of the sandwich and finished it as a bacon/veggie sandwich sans fish.  I decided to give this place a second chance, maybe the last time was a one-off situation. I ordered the grilled chicken cobb sandwich with fries, and experienced deja vu. I took a bite into the sandwich and the whole piece of chicken slid off with it. Again, the flavor was there, the pretzel bun was good. I tried another bite and couldn't get past the rubbery chicken. I again, pulled the piece of chicken off of the sandwich and ended up eating a bacon/veggie sandwich.  If I wanted to eat rubber for dinner, I would just stay at home and gnaw on my dog's Kong. It's too bad because if the fish and chicken were cooked properly, this place would actually be good."}
{"text":"We waited for about 15 minutes given the small restaurant was packed for a Sunday brunch. (Then you know it's good) No issues since we wanted to sit outside. Host staff was super friendly walking in considering how busy it was.   Can't say enough how good our food and bloody Mary's were. Perfectly spicy and not too overwhelming. I ordered the turkey sausage and polenta bowl and my friend ordered the steak and potatoes were both had huge portions. Our drinks and food took a little longer than expected but we were busy talking so it passed time.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and drinks! Just an FYI, not open for dinner. I've been there many, many times and I will be back again."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and the food is even better! Forget the chain breakfast spots, this is the best place to get your breakfast fix. This is coming from a self proclaimed breakfast food hater, but after trying the Daily Dose menu options I've found a new love for the most important meal of the day.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a new fan of Daily Dose MidTown! My family and I ate there for breakfast, and I went for the Sweet instead of Savory, which is very rare for me, but it turned out to be yummy! I got the PB&J Belgian Waffle. Such a creative dish and so HUGE! The portions here are monstrous, so come here with a big appetite. Others at my table got the prime rib benedict, the breakfast nachos and the berry multigrain pancakes, and all were huge portions. We left full & satisfied. Only withheld a star because there was a 20-minute wait in the hot sun with no chairs or benches to sit on. I feel like this would be an easy accommodation to make guests more comfortable."}
{"text":"This place is so great! It was past noon on a Saturday and my friend and I were looking for somewhere to have breakfast for lunch. Most of our go-tos stop serving breakfast around 1-2pm and we didn't really want to be, \"those customers.\" So we Yelped some options.   Daily Dose was one of the first to come up in the area and wow, served breakfast until 4pm on weekends! So we went.   I was so surprised when we walked in. There are indoor and outdoor seating sections, really friendly staff, and wow (again) so many options on the menu! We started by each ordering a bloody mary and then proceeded to take forever to choose from the many options. Again, I am soooo glad they serve breakfast later, as there never felt as if there was a rush for us to order. I finally decided on a Belgian waffle which turned out amazing. Upon receiving our check, prices were great too. Really awesome place.   I will definitely be back here! So many, \"wows!\""}
{"text":"First time here with was my wife and granddaughter I had the blue crab cake patty melt which was absolutely incredible my wife had  fish tacos also excellent our  granddaughter had the child's grilled cheese sandwich  it was a full sized sandwich and actually made like you would for an adult definitely a place I would return to"}
{"text":"Review for brunch only...  I woke up on a Sunday morning craving food. I woke up my roommate and used bribery and peer pressure to get him to agree to come out  for brunch. I told him pancakes fix hangovers. I even offered to buy his meal. He said he'd go, and all I had to buy was his first Bloody Mary! DEAL! It happened to be Easter Sunday. I called another restaurant and confirmed they were open, and called Daily Dose - was told they'd be open until 2. Since we can walk to Daily Dose, we opted to check it out. I also called and invited one of my favorite coworkers, who decided to meet us there.  The roomie and I started with Bloody Marys, waters and a coffee for me. The server then came back and asked the roommate for his ID. I asked if she wanted mine, too. She did not. BAD FORM! Unless I looked old enough to be his mother (I do not!), we should have both been carded. Servers should know this...it's the kind of thing that is reflected in the tip!  All the food was fresh and tasty - portions were ginormous. Crab cake Benedict is one of my new favorite things. Roomie had a burger that he was happy with, and a pancake on the side (gotta love hangover decisions!) I don't remember what the coworker had - I believe it was one of the omelets. We were all quite happy with the flavors, quality and quantity of our selections.  The server managed to make a boo-boo on the check. After my roommate and I had our cards run and my coworker had received her change, she came back to the table to inform me that she forgot to put my coffee on the bill - and what should she do? I was totally thrown off by this and answered (probably with more snark than needed in my tone) \"wow! looks like you just bought my coffee! thank you!.\" Seriously? AFTER the bill is paid, you're coming back to tell me you forgot the single cheapest item ordered - the one that cost the restaurant less than a dime, and you think *I* should do something about that?   I am sure I'll give DD another shot. The location and menu is too convenient and appealing to pass up entirely. But no matter how great the crab cake Bene was, I left with a bad taste in my mouth and felt regret I hadn't pushed for the other restaurant instead."}
{"text":"I have been to Daily Dose twice in the past week and it has been wonderful both times!  Lindsey was our server at our first visit and she was awesome!  The food was hot and delicious and everything was wonderful! I have worked in the food and beverage business for 30+ years and I love when a restaurant matches up to expectations.  I have recently moved to Arizona and am looking for a position that fits.  I felt that the DD and I would be a good match up.  So, I talked with Lindsey about it and she informed me that there were some possible upcoming positions at the DD.  She gave me an application and told me to try and come in on Saturday and she would give the manager (Allen)  a heads up.  I could not make it on Saturday, but I called Allen and explained who I was.  He asked me to come in on either Sunday or Monday after 2pm.  Yesterday (Monday), I did just that.   I walked in, introduced myself, handed Allen my application and resume and also told him I would be having lunch.  He told me that he had a interview coming in but that he would come over and speak with me when he was done.   That NEVER happened.  I didn't see him interviewing anyone, but he could have been doing that in a different part of the restaurant.  I waited for nearly an hour for him to come over and he never did.  I kept standing up to see where he was and he was standing at the bar each time.  How DISAPPOINTING!   If he didn't think that I would be a fit for DD, all he had to do was say so.  In all my years of management, I have never blown anybody off like that.  What an awful representation for the DD.  Little does he know, that I would have been such an asset to his team.  I am positive, energetic and love making connections with others.  I love the Food and Beverage Business and am passionate about customer service, team work and making the best of each day.   I'm sorry that Allen treats people in this way.  I hope he decides to take the time to get to know what people have to offer and finds the right people for his establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, good service, good pricing.  Highly recommended. A bottle of bubbly and a carafe if your favorite juice for under $20. Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Daily Dose on Highland a few months ago raving about the breakfast menu and we've returned for lunch and happy hour several times.  I've been back alone several times for lunch.  The kobe beef burgers have been consistently great (I like them best medium rare) and the pretzel buns only enhance the flavor! The sesame chicken skewer appetizers were tasty - just short of being a little dry when I ordered them last week. Servers have always been friendly. On 2 occasions no hostess was present and when she did appear offered no apology for making us wait. I'm sure that will be corrected so I'll be back and will refer friends.  Daily Dose is a great addition to this area."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I was disappointed in the quality of service.   I sat at the bar on a Sunday and it was not busy.   I had to ask three times for coffee creamer.   No water or coffee refill.  No one asked how the food was.  I saw an employee holding a disgusting rag that he was going to clean a table with.   The bartenders basically ignored the customers sitting at the bar.   I used to be a frequent customer at the Scottsdale location, which always had awesome service.    I'd chalk this experience up to a bad crew and poor leadership from the management.   With the amount of competition in breakfast/brunch spots in the area, i don't think I'd give this spot another chance."}
{"text":"I find that I tend to look at breakfast joints with a touch of extra scrutiny in part because the definition of what constitutes breakfast is often set in people's minds.  And sure, breakfast can be different things to different people whether its an omelet, pancakes, toast, cereal, or whatever.  But when you get down to it, there are three types of breakfast spots.  Those that are resolutely old school (i.e. Mike & Ronda's The Place, Mel's Diner, etc.), those that try to innovate (Zookz, Pomegranate Cafe, etc), and those somewhere in between.  Daily Dose seems to fit the somewhere in between category.  Having driven by Daily Dose's central Phoenix location for years, it was time to finally pay a visit at opening on Saturday.  Located just off the 51 freeway on the north side of Highland and 22nd Street, Daily Dose's Phoenix location has a laid back neighborhood feel from the moment you walk in.  The restaurant isn't particularly large, but can pretty comfortably pack in upwards of 100 patrons at a time.  Matt and JenLyn Long are the proprietors of Daily Dose which opened its flagship restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale almost a decade ago and the menu at their central Phoenix hub is identical to the one in Scottsdale.  With every breakfast spot I goto I'm looking for items that really stand out on the menu versus other breakfast spots.  Oftentimes I can pick them out myself, but some restaurants will steer you themselves by highlighting their own specialty items on the menu.  And it just so happens that Daily Dose circled one menu item in particular that they seem to take great pride in.  I've had chicken and waffles at plenty of establishments before including the iconic original Lo-Lo's in Downtown.  Daily Dose' Chicken & Waffles does their own spin on the dish.  The chicken is encrusted with bacon and fried, the waffle is a corn waffle and the toppings include two eggs your way (scrambled for me), corn salsa and harissa aioli.  And of course syrup to pour on top if you want (which I did).  I decided to get a side of DD's house made hash as well as a bowl of fruit.  And of course some fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it all down.  Total cost including tip came to about $25.  It should be said that the portion size of this dish will satisfy pretty much anyone's appetite as the waffle and chicken were both huge, and I certainly didn't leave hungry.  That said, this dish was far from perfect in my opinion.  I'm fine with a waffle that has a nice soft chewy inside, but I like a nice crispy exterior to go with it.  Unfortunately the exterior of this waffle was just as soft, thus giving the waffle more of a texture of pre-toasted bread than a waffle.  No complaints about the chicken or the aioli as both were delicious.  If you love corn, you'll probably love this dish in its entirety.  For me, it might've been a bit of corn overload between the corn waffle and the corn on top.  Even with the syrup, I didn't get much of the sweet savory punch I'd hoped for with this dish.  The other disappointment for me was the hash, which was basically equal parts onions, mushrooms, and potatoes.  If that's your thing, go for it.  Me?  I'm not a mushroom guy and would much prefer just a scant amount of onions and some corn beef or other filler as a substitute for the mushrooms.  The fruit bowl was solid with a variety of different fresh fruits and the orange juice was plenty satisfying.  Overall an okay, but somewhat disappointing first impression.  I'm quite confident in Daily Dose's ability to deliver a good meal on the more traditional fare they offer including the omelets, benedicts, and their assortment of healthy breakfast items.  But in terms of the more innovative stuff, I'll need to see some improvement over the meal I had this go around.  All of which is not to say you should stay away from Daily Dose, but rather just approach the non-traditional fare with caution.  And if you want my two cents, skip the hash.  Hopefully the next time I'm here for breakfast (or lunch) my meal will be up to par with the aesthetics of this neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast this morning at daily dose.  I had steak and eggs, with potatoes and toast.  It came with a horseradish sauce and au jus.  My partner had chorizo omlette and potatoes, with dd hash.  Everything tasted wonderful.  The service was fantastic.  The cups of coffee were huge, but welcoming as was the French pressed English breakfast tea.  We will be back soon, with friends."}
{"text":"We stopped by for brunch this morning and the Daily Dose did not disappoint. The staff is super friendly and menu offers something for everyone from breakfast to lunch items. My son had the breakfast burger which was a 1/3 lb hamburger patty with a fried egg and bacon on a big soft bun and it came with a huge side of fresh fruit. I had the pigs in a bagel sandwich which was eggs and bacon on a plain bagel and it  came with fruit and herbed potatoes. Everything was delicious and the service was quick considering how busy they were.  Brunch for two came to about $23.00 before the tip."}
{"text":"I always get the Turkey Sausage Whiteout and my honey gets the Breakfast Nachos and we LOVE them! the place is bright and spacious and the ambience is really nice. They are always PACKED on the weekends so there is always a wait to sit in anywhere other than the bar area. We have, however, sat in the bar area and the service was even better and faster. Food always hot and delicious and they are willing to modify anything on the menu. Sometimes too busy and you have to waive down someone to help get you something."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service. I had the chicken enchiladas, which were OK but kinda boring, hence the 3 stars instead of more. Haven't these folks ever heard of herbs and spices? However, I was with friends and they said their entrees were very good."}
{"text":"Yummy perfect breakfast!! Love the French toast!! Bacon cooked to perfection..... best OJ also!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how different my dish was.  I usually go to the Daily Dose in Old Town and 9 times out of 10 get the prime stack sandwich.  The bun was the same, but not much else.  The meat was skimpy and unevenly spread on the sandwich and they were cheap with the slaw.  It also seemed like they heated the meat up on the grill because it was super dry and there were parts of it that tasted burnt.  It was utterly disappointing and if that was the first time I'd gotten that entree item I probably would never know how great it could be.  Service was also pretty bad for not being very busy.  I don't think they refilled any of our drinks and I had a watery remnants of coke for half the meal.  The Old Town branch is better with the service as well."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here are keep getting excellent service and terrifically tasty food so what can I say besides IM A FAN! The chorizo Mac n cheese made me want to lick the bowl after we finished an appetizer portion of it. I kind of did, but in a classy way- with my finger! ;) it's that good! The turkey burger was the best I have had in a long time. The pretzel bun is incredible! I finally had breakfast there and it was to die for! Breakfast nachos and a peanut and jelly waffle with syrup and bananas? Yes please! It was a bit much, but we had to do it! There were so many other things on the breakfast menu that I wanted it was hard to decide. I wouldn't do the nachos again by myself, but would definitely split them with others. I want to try some of the mouthwatering omlette's next time. Too many good choices here, they have me hooked."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the daily dose a few times and the food, service, atmosphere have always been stellar! Dog friendly patio too!!! Love this place! My fave dish on the menu: breakfast nachos!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this restaurant and both times the service was extremely slow. I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Food alright, Drinks not bad, SERVICE IS HORRIBLE- manager was there the whole time and was just as bad as the incompetent bar tender who couldn't handle 4 tables in a dead restaurant. I was appalled and will not return"}
{"text":"I've been going to lunch here for quite a while and I think I've only had one bad thing on the menu.  (Stay away from the chicken fingers, super bland)   Hey have an amazing chorizo Mac and cheese, mahi taco, great burgers, prime rib dip, salads and just about anything else has never let me down.  Friendly staff and a nice location."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, got a BLT with fries, pretty tasty, good service, great location, clean facilities, will be back. five stars."}
{"text":"Good food but slooooowwww service that doesn't check up on you to see if you need anything ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I think I prefer the downtown Scottsdale location.  I think the service was a little bit better there.  Food was just as good though.  I love the heart healthy option of egg white omelette with turkey sausage.  I think its called whiteout something...  Comes with a HUGE bowl of fresh fruit!  Hubby likes the steak/prime rib sandwich that comes on a pretzel bun.  He didn't enjoy it as much this last time but it's still a good choice on the menu.  They have a ginger champagne drink... its delicious.  tastes like Gingerale...  tried to make it at home... just didn't taste the same...  DD what's ur secret???  I think they do have a good happy hour but I haven't been to it yet...  Speaking with my other foodie friends... they all enjoy this place as well...  a lot of choices on the menu... Oh and last time there... someone ordered a burger... it looked fantastic... gonna have to try one of those sometime."}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo mac and cheese, turned out to be pretty good. Not a huge fan of the chorizo, but the dish itself was good. Garden salad was pretty decent as well.  I just had a glass of water to drink, which came with a cucumber instead of lemon or lime - I don't think I'd make that call.  Bread pudding for dessert - it was delicious. It had a deep and rich flavor. Definitely recommended.  I'll be back - seems like it would be a good happy hour place as well."}
{"text":"Delicious..  stated with chips & salsa & guacamole.  Guacamole was some of the best I've had.  Also tried both regular fries & sweet potato and both very tasty and both crispy.  They have a Chipotle ranch that we dipped fries in and was just right.  Tacos were good as well as the turkey burger.  And staff was on point.  Very helpful, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Whoa! At first, I thought this place was going to be one of those overrated places, where I'd leave feeling..meh...But I'm happy to report that Daily Dose is legit. I guess it helps that I came here in super starvation mode, so the generous portion here earns an automatic 2 stars. I got the Roasted Turkey omelette, which comes with 3 eggs (I got egg whites...ugh, healthy), your choice of toast, potato, and (thats right, \"and\" not \"or\") fruits. The potato is where Daily Dose earns its other 2 stars. It was a much appreciated surprise to see deliciously chopped and baked (fried? cooked? i dont know..) potatoes that compliment my omelette so well. Their multigrain toast also tasted a lot better than it sounds. I love it when my stupid decision to go for the \"healthy\" option does not taste healthy at all!!! For the price, I'm pretty sure I won this round.  They have outside seating, which is awesome in this Phoenix weather. Inside looks nice too. Not to mention, they have a Frys grocery store right next door, and a gas station in the same parking lot..SO I got all my errands done in one spot...pretty darn effective if you ask me."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and while the atmosphere is nice, the food is very average."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to daily dose, I always get a good meal (good). This location has a little patio with some tables that is great in the nicer weather. Portions are an indulgent size.  Last time I was here, I was not too crazy about my chicken wrap with bacon and avocado. My friend and I were so excited about our sweet potato fries until they came out cold!!! That always brings down a star in my book! Our waitress was extremely friendly but kind of slow getting our order and drinks.  Regardless, I love to come here occasionally for lunch and drinks. Just hope they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dailydose. .hands down the best!! Freshest food, best service, nicest staff, cleanest restaurant in town..love the food.  Im telling you, ITS SLAMMIN!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast while getting a car wash, i seated myself by the bar b/c no greeter.  waited for about a good 5 minute before they actually acknowledged me (which is a little sad, it's not like I'm terrible looking or something hahah).  Ordered steak and eggs for breakfast, bloody Mary on the side.  Steak...definitely over cooked with no presentation, just a plain slab of meat with no seasoning and some eggs.  Pretentious and over rated.  Definitely not waste your time there.  terrible service and terribly prepared food."}
{"text":"Five star food but unfortunately the service is so slow i have to take back a star. We shared the breakfast nachos for the table and it so big, we had trouble finishing. They have some great eggs bene (my favorite) and my grandson loves the pancakes. i've been several times now and the food is always good but so far the service-not so much."}
{"text":"Chorizo egg Benedict and the bacon omelet high on the list! The coffee was unusually good as well!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, it's very lively the staff is on top of it. Got the Southwest Flannel Hash it is freaken ahhmaazing! Loved the mixed berry pancakes. Overall, it's a great place. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hi Daily Dose...I love you!  I am a breakfast faaaanatic and this is my favorite spot to go for breakfast. They have an amazing selection of different omelets (bacon, meat & cheese, or the roasted turkey are my favorites), they give you the option of cottage cheese, and their DD hash...don't get me started! My taste buds go wild for this place. The DD hash is a must, it isn't even potatoes, it's SQUASH! Squash?? I know what you're thinking...trust me, it's amazing.   Of course, a breakfast would not be complete without coffee, and their coffee is another perk to this place. It's always fresh and they give you the option of getting syrups (almond is the best).   On some days after my workout I'm feeling extra ris-kay...so I opt for their mixed berry protein pancakes. My first reaction to trying these was to dance in my chair for a good 30 seconds, they are that delicious. Do you tummy a favor and try them! They are huge though, so you can definitely share."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for breakfast and I am always really happy with the breakfast menu.  Although they have the usual heavy breakfast items they also have some healthy low calorie options as well.  The atmosphere is nice and the service is always fast and friendly.  Today, I really wanted something refreshing while my boyfriend wanted a burger.  I admit that I was a bit skeptical about the lunch/dinner menu but I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the strawberry mint salad.  It was amazing!  It was perfect!  It was exactly what I wanted.  My boyfriend was also really happy with his burger.  We also sat outside and the weather was perfect also.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Perfect little brunch place! We came in around 1 and decided to sit outside because of the amazing weather that day. Our group of 3 came hungry so we decided to order 2 appetizers and an entree for each of us.   We ordered the nachos and hummus with pita and holy moly the portions are huge! The hummus was pretty average, it was a little too grainy for my liking, but the nachos were great! I bet you're thinking \"how good can nachos be?\" and that's usually my thinking as well but along with the traditional nacho toppings it came with a tomatillo salsa and a white cheese sauce that makes it unique.   For my entree I ordered the breakfast burger with fruit on the side. A side of fruit with a burger may seem insane but when you have so many heavy ingredients such as runny egg yolk, pork sausage, bacon and cheese sauce, something light and refreshing is definitely welcome. Overall the burger was good, with great bacon and nicely cooked runny egg! The only minor issue was that the pork patty itself was very heavily seasoned with paprika and cumin which made it taste like mexican chorizo. It's not necessarily a bad thing but it overpowered the rest of the burger.   Overall a great place for breakfast or lunch and would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. So many options and they are all amazing. Try the dd hash for a unique take on breakfast potatoes. Any of the eggs benedict are mouthwatering.  Puppy friendly on their patio."}
{"text":"Good brunch spot with a surprisingly tasty drink menu - especially if you like carbonated alcoholic bevs for brunch :-)  Ordered the flannel hash overeasy and my friend ordered the gluten-free turkey burger - both good.  The meat in the hash could've had more flavor though. Service was prompt, everyone was friendly, and a buzzing, social atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place.  Breakfast Nachos are CRACK!!"}
{"text":"I love getting breakfast here. Love the chorizo wrap, the cinnamon roll pancakes, the power bowls, and the DD style Benedict. You can't go wrong, is what I'm saying... Unless you show up after 9:30 on a weekend, then be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the overall review rating of 3 1/2 stars. I'm just rounding up to four stars because I see the glass half full.  First of all, my wife love, love, loves the Banana Bread French Toast and would kill me if she knew I was only giving this place 4 stars. The last time I was here for breakfast, I ordered the Naked French Toast with potatoes. I thought 3 tiny pieces of French toast was a pretty weak menu offering. Plus the service during this visit was slow. I had to lay some cash at my table before I got the check since I had to get to the office. I let the bartender know that I had to split and that the cash was on the table. BTW - They serve alcohol in the morning.  Another time I had their burger on a pretzel roll. And it was perfectly cooked and delicious. One of the best burgers I have had in awhile. I also like Daily Dose when I don't feel like fighting the crowds on a Friday night. It's not as busy as some other places so you can kick back and have a cocktail and a mellow meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and am disappointed every time. The food is boring and bland!"}
{"text":"I'm starting saying this wasn't my first time coming over here; well on Wednesday 27 of September around 8:30 am, I met one of my girlfriend for breakfast, it was my treat, I mentioned it to her that the food was pretty good.  We walked in and immediately the girl at the front look at us in a mean kind of way, she didn't say hello, nothing, just \"TWO\"? well I didn't like the way she treated us but I didn't want that to spoil our morning. The food was great, my friend liked it so did I, the waiter was attentive.  Towards the end we felt rush cause they kept moving tables, accommodating chairs, mentioning how they were going to sit people around us, (we were just at the corner) WE FELT LIKE THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF US, cause the other party was larger, not cool at all."}
{"text":"Daily Dose is a great place for breakfast or lunch! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The service was great also!"}
{"text":"The first time that I went to Daily Dose I didn't exactly have a great experience. It took a while to get service and when we did get it, it wasn't great.  I'm happy to say that my next visit was the complete opposite!  We were seated quickly and the servers and I'm assuming this person was a manager was super nice!    I have only tried the appetizers and have been pleased with those. I had the pretzels and the jalapeno chorizo mac n cheese.  The pretzels were pretty good.  It comes with two tasty dips, but the mac n cheese is to die for!  I could eat that dis everyday!  I even took a second order home for my husband to try.  I ended up eating that one too!    Their happy hour prices are pretty good.  I love having so many options!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Meh. We went here for happy hour.   The happy hour prices aren't that great in my opinion. In fact, I found the happy hour prices to be pretty comparable to other bar's normal prices for beers, snacks, etc.  We ordered a few beers.  They were good.  Beer = good.  We ordered chicken skewers and pretzels as snacks.  I thought the pretzels were sub par (though I do always compare pretzels to the mall pretzels... mmm... butter = good) Chicken skewers were a bit on the rubbery side.  Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I'm still wowed. The DD Hash is hands down the best thing since sliced bread. Speaking of sliced bread, I had the best darn gluten free hamburger bun tonight. In fact, I got to order like a semi-normal person, getting the bbq black and blue burger with corn meal onion rings (all gluten free). First time since my allergy diagnosis that I've had onion rings and the only gf bun I've not yanked off rather than eat (and boy did I eat). The service is OUTSTANDING - every time we go. The burger was really fantastic (the quality and preparation was aces). I couldn't have been more pleased. The onion rings were great, but remember I've not been able to eat onion rings in over a year, so your experience may vary. Their green iced tea is great. Our servers always go above and beyond and are more than friendly. Although the line can be long for weekend breakfast and brunch, dinner was easier to be seated, and maybe even more delicious."}
{"text":"Erica was great behind the bar this Friday. Quick, attentive and personable. I sat, ate, chatted, and knocked out a cover letter all before lunch... Awesome"}
{"text":"I liked that Daily dose accommodated a group of 10 around 1pm for lunch on Saturday in the back. Being from out of town and nearby, the reviews of this place was positive enough for us to check it out.   Here's the downlow: -Service was attentive  -The menu is overwhelming. There's a plethora of choices especially if you're debating breakfast or lunch food.  -The pbj waffle was very filling. Basically peanut butter and jelly on a Belgian waffle. Can't get any complicated than that. It was topped with Alice of bananas too.  -Chicken nachos was a hit at our table. I recommend sharing this because the portion is huge. I wish they had more toppings though. There was more nacho chips.  -Liked that they had a health but section.  Turkey sausage whiteout was average. I didn't think the turkey sausage was very flavorful. It reminded me of elementary crumbled sausage served during lunch. The fruit side was plentiful and I was able to sub out the toast for butternut squash which was good.   I recommend as a breakfast, brunch, lunch spot."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We came here for breakfast and it was delicious. I ordered the roasted poblano and polenta eggs Benedict. It wasn't too spicy and had tons of flavor. The dd hash is amazing. It's butternut squash, mushrooms, and onions and it comes as a side with most of the dishes. My husband ordered the naked French toast and it was really good too. The jalapeño cornbread pancakes were really good and different but super spicy! I want to come back and try all of their pancakes, because those looked amazing too. The waitress was very nice and the service was good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Consistency pays off! Winner, winner chicken dinner in all categories: 1) courteous hostesses taking ur name down to get seated (complimentary water and coffee always available in the entry way) 2) quick to get seated 3) quick to come by with waters, take drink orders, and food order also! 4) EXCELLENT, FLAVORFUL, GINORMASOURAS REX PLATEFUL O' DELICIOUSNESS!!!!!!!!! 5) low prices for what you get = SKY HIGH VALUE PROP  6) always leave happy and satisfied...I'd smoke a cigarette or three afterwards- IF I were a smoker! Lol"}
{"text":"Unlike some of its other patrons, my experience at Daily Dose Midtown was positive. The service was fast and friendly (though the crowd was light) and the food was reasonably good. It's a clean, comfortable, inviting place to meet friends.  Plus, at bar, the HH price is nice."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of the Scottsdale location, came to check this one out since the wait on Sundays in Old Town is pretty long. (Obvi. The food is great.) I'm writing this review on my phone while we continue to wait for the check. Our waitress went missing a while ago... Not that she was around much to begin with. This was after the hostess forgot about us, even though we were in plain sight the whole time. Food is still good, same offerings as the Scottsdale location. I'd suffer the wait at Old Town for better service. Well... That's my review! Still no sign of the waitress or check....."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst service. I'm hooked on the food and service at the Scottsdale location. For some reason everything tastes different and just plain \"not good\". How do you mess up a Cobb salad or a burger? Will never return unless they get these people on the same page as the other location."}
{"text":"Yum! Get the Chorizo Burrito super yummy- not to big like your usual chorizo burro that makes you feel like you just ate an elephant and then drank 2 bottles of Maalox. Oh and the potatoes that comes with it are just as taste. The bf and I got it to go so next time we go we will try the nice big patio and have a drink or two or....three!"}
{"text":"I love Jess best in the biz what an asset she is love her!!!!! Best Gluten free blueberry pancakes anywhere! Service was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good location but they don't accept reservations even for large parties of 20 for a special event.  Seems silly and unwise business practice to not at least allow special parties of a certain size to have a reservation.   Get with the times DD!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast if your visiting Phoenix. The bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable about menu. She helped me pick this awesome Green Chile Eggs Benedict that hit the spot. Definitely going back the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had a great time.  We were sat right away,  even though we came around noon on a Sunday so it was pretty busy. We got a bloody Mary and a bloody Maria, both were delicious and unique, I had the sriracha UV in my bloody Mary.  We ordered eggs Benedict and huevos rancheros. We finished everything on our plates.  Our waitress was great too,  she brought us some extra hot sauces and salsa,  and made great reccomendations for beers!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic happy hour that goes until 9pm!!!! RARE. Love that you don't have to rush from the office! And their Happy Hour has a pretty vast selection for both food and drink. And the pretzel rolls...oh the pretzel rolls. Almost all burgers and sandwiches come on them, thankfully!  Service has always been great, and the food is awesome! Especially breakfast. Lots and lots of options!  We've been to both locations and they are both equally good. But for some reason, other than breakfast this location doesn't ever seem to be as busy; I don't understand why. If you are looking for a new place to try - DO IT! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting menu, great service. Really good alternative to a chain breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times for breakfast (they only serve breakfast and lunch) and always had a good experience. The food is good and they offer nice size portions. Bonus points for offering a gluten free pancake option, which is hard to find, and actually really good! I also love the \"Grown Up\" coffee options. My fav is the Smooth Irish which has coffee, Bailey's and whipped cream vodka. Yum!"}
{"text":"One piece of gluten free toast costs $2.25. It says on menu gluten free is extra $.75 but id you order one piece of toast additionally it is $2.25. This was my last visit here and ai've been a regular."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch, great food, fun atmosphere.  I had the turkey burger and combo crispy and sweet potato fries.  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My family we LOVE coming here!! They have amazing scramble options. They're also incredibly gluten free friendly with very unique gluten free pancake options - cinnamon roll is my favorite pancake!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Daily Dose takeout. I wanted something modified heavily and the guy that took the order (Keenan I believe) was helpful and added suggestions and got the order right."}
{"text":"Alright kids, let's cut straight to the chase here; Daily Dose (Double D) Midtown is without question our (my wife and I's) favorite, guaranteed great experience eatery in the PHX metro area.  My wife and I do a great deal of international traveling for work and fun, which means our exposure to amazing food is prevalent. And as a former 300lb man, I can assure you that my addiction to food is, surely, only marginalized when compared to a toothbrush armed meth-head focused on a filthy grout line. Food is my black-tar, and Double D is my Syringe.   Now, I'm not going to insult any of the other foodies out there by trying to compare Double D to a 5-Star experience, because it's not - neither in presentation or atmosphere, but what it does have is unrivaled consistency, creativity, and made-in-house goodness. The customer service experience is always exceptional, helping to reinforce our love for Dub-D-Delight!  Let's talk food. Avocado covered Bacon Omelette...Dope. Made-in-House berry preserves...Redic. Taste bud-gasmic made-in-house ketchup....WHAT!? Unicorn Tusk infused Buttermilk pancakes (slightest crunch on the outside, soft and magical on the inside)...Sensational. Egg white omelette with made-in-house turkey sausage...mind=blown! Protein pancakes that don't make you call into question your decision to pretend to be healthy...legit! Pretzel bun'd - Angel tear glazed Daily Dose Burger intoxication...radical.   If you like witty repartee with wait staff, managers, and owners who like to laugh and are not afraid to share their honest opinions about life, their bat shit crazy dogs, travel, and just about any mildly offensive topic of choice  - then this is your mutha friggin holy land. Really great people, with really great attitudes.   If you are are a quiet, pretentious recluse who is used to consuming boxed waffles and drinking syrup from the bottle, then stay away - for you will surely be disappointed by the annoying fact that DD is not located in a graveled trailer park lot.   The best thing I can say about Daily Dose, is that we keep coming back for more. We bring friends, family, and colleagues with us as often as possible, and the results are always the same; complete satisfaction.  Keep doing you DD - and we will continue to publicly glutton ourselves in your house of worship. ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot! Today was my third time here. I've had the SW Chorizo wrap twice now and it's excellent. The Gladiator burger is no joke either. I wouldn't recommend their Bloody Mary. Pretty bland"}
{"text":"I love the menu here, especially for breakfast!  It is fun and unique and not things you would necessarily make at home.  The staff is always nice when we come.  A great quiet place to have a company meeting or catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing! We stumbled across this place by accident, and what a wonderful accident it was. Wonderful swrvice, reasinable prices and the best breakfast I have had in a while."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Daily Dose and I think I got really lucky!  I went for brunch on a Sunday and only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on the patio.  The main reason for the 5 stars is because I had one of the best veggie burgers of my life!  If you follow my other reviews, you will see that I'm a big supporter of quality veggie burgers and I try them everywhere I go.  This one was definitely memorable and moves into my top 3 in Phoenix.  The patty is homemade with tasty grains and herbs - not frozen or too hard.  The bun is a fatty delicious pretzel bun which is fantastic but probably not the healthiest option.  It comes with a great yogurt dill sauce that gives it a little Mediterranean flare.  Or it with waffle fries if you're feeling crazy!    If you don't like veggie burgers.... you can't go wrong with any of their pancakes, omelets or breakfast nachos!"}
{"text":"The Reuben was terrible. It had no flavor and it lacked corned beef. My buddy had a southwest salad it tasted like air. Basically the food is flavorless. I will never come here again. And the service was slow and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Out shopping with mom and stopped in for late lunch. Love their Desert Fruit tea and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have high standards when it comes to food. This place does it right!!! They have great coffee, their omelettes are perfectly cooked and have a great amount of the ingredients you ordered in them. Their sides are perfectly done. The quality of their food is great. The fruit they serve is always ripe and delicious. I am not a pancake person, but here I always order a pancake as they are crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside, made on the griddle. We are regulars and so far I haven't tried one thing I didn't like! Their burgers are amazing too! With a pretzel bun! Their hummus platter! I can go on and on! Great quality food, and you can tell is FRESH! In addition to that, they have #1 customer service. They are on it! And the ambiance is great too! Yes, yes... I truly love this place! Too bad they are not open in the evening anymore!"}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite for happy hour, really sad their closing at 3pm now."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service. I expected there to be a long wait seeing as it was a Sunday morning, but to my surprise there was none.  The restaurant is very modern and furnished very well. We were seated and had out drink orders taken right away.  I decided on the southwestern flannel hash and split the banana bread French toast with my mother. The food came out crazy fast. Less than ten minutes and it was piping hot!  The hash was wonderful. Packed with amazing flavor and a little bit of a kick to it.  The French toast was out of this world. Extremely decadent and filling.  The service was fast and friendly. Keegan was very knowledgeable of the menu and providing us with feedback. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and this visit was a little disappointing. I usually really look forward to breakfast here. It was probably what I ordered. I thought I'd give their protein pancakes a try but they paled in comparison to my favorite ones made at another Valley restaurant. I do love their DD hash and the banana bread French toast (wow). They have super reasonable bloody Mary's and mimosas. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good food! I had the huevos rancheros burger a that was amazing!! The best selection is decent....had a pumpkin porter which was amazing but not enough selection of dark beer. The beer selection itself wasn't the greatest. The bartender was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed, even when she was running around trying to do a million things at once."}
{"text":"I first experienced the Daily Dose in Scottsdale so when I saw they opened a location in the Biltmore area I was super excited!  One evening my husband I were desperately looking around for a place that either delivered or we could pick up take out.  So I mentioned to my hubby about the new Daily Dose around the corner.  They closed at 9 and we literally called at 8:45 to place 2 full meals, and appetizers.  We ordered a full rack of ribs, salmon, and crab cakes as the appetizer.  The entrees came with julienned veggies and a full salad (house or caesar.)  We are not fans of julienned veggies so those were a waste.    However, the salmon was excellent.  I asked for no BBQ and just had it blackened and well-done (which I love!)  I was given a nice amount of salmon, not a small piece.  For it being the end of the night, the fish was cooked nicely and was still fresh.    My husband got a full rack of ribs and those were amazing.  The only possible complaint I might have about those is that they were a bit salty but I don't cook with salt so that might have been it.  The rib meat literally fell off the bone....so incredible!  I am so happy there is a place by us that has delectable ribs.  If you go to Daily Dose for dinner please try the ribs! They are truly delicious!   The crab cakes were quite good; there were three of them atop a bed of a corn salsa.  There were a few sauces including a creme aioli type sauce and green chile salsa.  The cakes were very yummy.   When we stopped in to get our food I asked if it was too late to order a sangria which they said it was- bummer.  But, the kind cute little bartender let me have a generous sample of the frozen sangria from their machine-deeeeeelicious!    I can't wait to go back to try more sangria and also more items from the menu.  This restaurant was a little pricey so bring some money honey! $65 was our total."}
{"text":"How did I not know they put this in?!? The husband and I really enjoy the location in Old Town, but we try to avoid that area as much as possible. So we were thrilled to see they put in a new restaurant closer to our hood.   First of all, let me start by saying that we had some of the best service we've ever received during our lunch here. Our server was casual and friendly, without being overwhelming. He was always strolling by to check on us...we didn't even have to wait for refills. The atmosphere of the place is definitely what I picture when I think of a breakfast joint (even though we were here for lunch). It's cozy, comfortable, and clean. The patio looks awesome, but it was way too hot to try that out this time around. The other thing that will keep me coming back is the menu. They have so many options that look so good! This time around I had the caprese grilled cheese and my husband tried an omelet. Both were super tasty and very filling. We also started with their chips, salsa, and guac,,,also very good.   All in all, we really like this place and we're so happy they're close by now. I'll definitely be back again...for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love the variety of items they serve in a relaxed environment. Thanks for the great meal and awesome service!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of weeks back for Smunch.  It was during a bitter cold weekend so as cool as the patio looked there was only one bundled up couple.  The place was busy the whole time we were there and several people waiting for seating as we left.  But we, a party of 12, never felt rushed.  Service was very good.  The two waitresses knew the menu and had no problems splitting checks and answering questions.  I had the crabby omelet with DD hash and it was very good and I had trouble stuffing it all in."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to grab breakfast. I've been here a handful of times since I've moved back but mostly for meetings so I've never really gotten to enjoy the food like this time. We got here about 9:15 and decided to sit at the bar since we had a movie to get to.  Pros  ~Food made just the way you order it..I'm very particular about the way my bacon is cooked    and they made it just how I liked it without having to send it back  ~Never an empty cup...whether it was coffee or water my cup was always topped off ~AMAZING bloody Mary's... The blood Mary was so good that I ordered just the mix so I could take it home and enjoy one at home ~Super friendly staff.. The server knew we were going to the movie and was kind enough to put ice in a plastic bag so I could keep the bloody Mary mix on ice... NOW THAT\"S SERVICE!!!  Cons ~Depending on how large your party and what time you get there you may have to wait a little bit. I personally have never had to wait since I'm usually just a plus 1  Overall Daily Dose Midtown gets 4 stars looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Cute, bright, and a clean place!  Too hot to sit in the patio, so M and I selected to sit inside.  The place got busier and busier as it got closer to noon.  I ordered breakfast because I never wake up early enough to eat it.  LOL!!!  The meat and cheese omelete, toast, potatoes, etc. were all so good.  The service was great.  I loved the green ice tea....  LOVE it.  The server even gave me a cup to go....  SWEET!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I do not agree with the other two reviews.  We stopped at this place to grab a drink and appetizer because we had some time to kill before meeting some friends, and the place looked cute as we were driving by. Service was extremely slow.  Despite all the empty tables on the patio when we came in, we were told 10-15 minutes for a table outside.  We did only wait about 5, but then we waited almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink order.  We ordered a beer, a margarita, and chips, salsa and guacamole, and 2 waters with lemon.  5 minutes later the water comes out....without lemon.  Server says she's going to go get our drinks and I ask for lemons also.  She's off, and I take a sip of my water.  Yuck!  Worst water I've ever had at a restaurant, so five minutes later when she brings our drinks and the lemon, I don't even use it because no amount of lemon is going to get rid of the dirt taste in the water.  So now we finally have our drinks and she says our chips and salsa should be up soon.  5 minutes later we get our chips and salsa and guacamole.  What can I say....it tasted like chips, salsa and guacamole.  The whole place just felt kind of lame and depressing.  Staff didn't have much personality.  Overall we were just unimpressed."}
{"text":"We took our second trip to this place today and i was a little disappointed with the service so i had to take away a star. Besides the lack of urgency I got from every employee in the place their food always tastes great. Unfortunately today they served me sunny side up eggs instead of over hard so i had to wait an additional 5 minutes while everyone else at my table ate, but once my food did come, cooked properly, it was tasty! overall this is a great place to grab some breakfast until 4pm any day of the week! i havent tried anything on their lunch or dinner menu, but i plan to go back soon so i can!"}
{"text":"First-time diner there. Solid place for lunch. Nice atmosphere inside and I could picture having a nice craft brew on the patio with family or friends. I ordered a burger -- 8 oz. of Kobe, cooked just as I asked, with bacon (mmmmm..bacon...), sauteed onions, basil & lettuce on a pretzel roll. Juicy, tasty, terrific. Should have ordered the 10 oz. version for another $1 more. Very large portion of mixed fries (1/2 reg., 1/2 sweet potato). My colleague had a big veggie burger that she enjoyed, and bowl of sweet potatoes and \"other stuff\" that was super delicious. Service was attentive and fun. I'll definitely be back. Maybe for \"breakfast for lunch\" -- the pancake menu (served til 4 p.m.) looked great."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with my meal. I had asked for my burger to be medium rare and it was way over done. In addition it really needed salt and pepper to improve the flavor. The DD hash that came with it was very disappointing as well. The butternut squash was way over cooked and mushy and it seems to be swimming in grease. Other items that people ordered at my table looked pretty good however so maybe I will give it another shot one day..."}
{"text":"Over all I really like this restaurant lots of food for your budget and genuinely delicious. The waiters and bartenders are great just overwhelmed. Although the hostesses need to work on their attitude. That's the first impression you get when entering the restaurant and both times being here it through me off.  Second time coming here and the food is amazing! Order the potatoes they are so delicious. Orange juice freshly squeezed. Food and drink wise is awesome. And the restaurant atmosphere in general is very inviting.    The only negative thing I would have to put is the service here. Both times I've been here the two hostesses have been giggly and unprofessional. When we asked if there were fans on the outside before we sat out there (it's 104 degrees)  she said \"oh no those are for decoration\" sarcastically then turned them on and started giggling with the other hostesses   The waitresses and bartenders are great they just seem to get a bit overwhelmed our food and drinks always came out in a good time. Always by a different person though causing confusion.  Go here great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolute disaster.   It was not that busy, people waiting and standing for anyone to not only greet but to be seated as well.  Food is good but not worth the horrible service.  It felt like only one person was working even though I saw a full staff.  This is my last time.  Save yourself the trouble and eat across the street at Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped in here last night for some drinks before grocery shopping. It was a good time.  When we arrived at 4pm, it was really dead. We were pretty much the only ones in there. But they let us know right away that we were just in time for happy hour (woohoo!). So we each ordered a drink (he had a beer and then a specialty coffee, I had 3 spiked arnold palmers). The drinks were fantastic! Our waitress was also the bartender, which was cool. We also ordered a couple soft pretzels to start us off. OMG they were good! Super soft with 2 different delicious dipping sauces. Soooo good. Then, we ordered a veggie burger on a pretzel bun and split it. It was big, the waitress put it on two plates for us, we didn't even ask! Super sweet of her. It comes with ketchup and two other sauces. I think one was a cucumber sauce, and the other was just delicious. I have no idea what it is.  We hung out and people watched for a few hours. There was some good people watching to be had. The place was pretty mellow, and right down the street from our house. I'm hesitant to put more great details because I really like this place and don't want it to blow up. lol But I will say, we will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Meh. That's all I really had to say after eating here. Service was absolutely great, no complaints about that whatsoever. Food on the other hand, not the greatest. I got the chorizo and jalapeño corn cakes. Pretty disappointed, too dry and hardly any chorizo. Husband got the nuts and berries French toast. He said it was just okay. I tried it, way too sweet for me. I might come back but definitely would try something different. Maybe their lunch is better? Overall it we just okay. You're not missing out on anything if you've never been here."}
{"text":"This place was really good. It is on the corner of a strip mall. I had the chopped salad with crispy chicken. I got the half size and couldn't eat it all. Also eaten at the table was cinnamon pancakes and a eggs Benedict. I took a bit of the pancakes. They were yummy. Not overly sweet like some can be. I would return to this place again if in the area."}
{"text":"I went to The Daily Dose Midtown for lunch. It wasn't very busy so I easily found myself a seat. After reviewing the extensive menu I decided on the Cobb Sandwich which was a delicious grilled chicken breast with blue cheese, lettuce, tomato and I'm probably leaving a few things off, on a pretzel bun. It came with a side (but I was accidentally offered two) of which I chose the sweet potato hash (cubed sweet potatoes, mushrooms and onions), and a side of fruit.  I thought everything was delicious. Would I go back? Absolutely. I caught a peek at someone's salad and it looked amazing. Huge, but amazing. I can't wait to try one next time."}
{"text":"I went to Daily Dose for Sunday breakfast and was ignored for about 10 minutes after being seated.  As I was picking up my phone to call the restaurant to request some coffee, a server appeared.  The young lady appeared irritated that we were there but took our drink order.  Someone must have noticed because a short while later a friendly gal came by to take over our service.    I had the mixed berry protein pancakes and they were delicious!  Long story short....a weird experience with the service that ended on a positive note and phenomenal food.  Will definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been stopping here for breakfast for the past 3 or 4 weeks.  I am very impressed in the consistency of the food and service.  When I go out for breakfast I am not looking for fine dinning service.  I just want my drink and my food, a little conversation, and then my bill.  Daily Dose caters to all my expectations of what a breakfast joint should be. Laid back good food, and service with a smile!  Thanks for becoming my morning go to spot!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Nice atmosphere.  Good food.  Good service.  A little pricey, but they do have an awesome happy hour that makes it affordable.  I really don't have much to say bad about this place, but something is off and I cannot give it 3 or 4 stars when I would choose about two or three other places to go to in the area before coming there.  They do serve brunch, so if that is your thing maybe throw in an extra star, but its not something I seek out personally."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for lunch. Wife had the steak and eggs. They were excellent and the Home made mixed berry jam for the twist was also superb. Panko chicken fingers is also an excellent choice here. Very attentive staff. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"DD is the go to spot when friends and I are looking to get together for breakfast and I've never had a bad experience here.  The staff is great.  They're attentive and friendly.  I like that the manager can always be seen going around asking tables how their meal was.  I had to send something back once and he brought it back and apologized which I appreciated.  Mimosas are good.  Coffee is great.  I go so much that I try to have something different every time, but a girl is always going to have her favorites.  I had the Hangover sandwich last Saturday.  It was delicious.  I don't know what they do to their bacon, maybe they made love to it, but whatever they do it works.   Their Veggie omelette is really good.  Their bagel & lox is something that I'd have no problems not ordering ever again, you're better off having Einstein bros.  Traditional burger is a solid good burger.  I tried their Southwest Flannel Hash recently and it's different.  I haven't quite made up my mind on it yet.  Our server said they make it from scratch, which I love, but maybe if they grilled it to be well done it'd be better. Comes out looking like a pot roast.  I might give it another try before I write it off completely, but I can always stick to their DD hash."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place that my coworkers recommended. One of my coworkers and I ordered the exact same salad, with chicken, and dressing on the side. As we placed our order, we even commented on it being exactly the same. When the food came, they brought me the wrong salad. When we pointed out the error, the server trounced back into the kitchen and pronounced loudly enough that I could hear it across the restaurant \"she ordered a Cobb\". Several minutes later, the correct salad appeared, but no dressing on the side. When we asked for dressing, they brought it out and I started to eat the salad. About 3 bites in, I realized that they HAD put plenty of dressing on the salad so I wasn't going to be able to eat it. I ate the chicken breast off the top and that was it. Oh, and I found bacon in the salad, which I can't eat (wasn't supposed to be on the correct salad) which means they just scraped the ingredients off of the original salad and threw new toppings on. Why would I order the Cobb salad, knowing it had bacon on it if I can't eat bacon? The server came to clear the plates and asked if I wanted a box. I said no. Clearly I hadn't eaten any of the salad. She asked if something was wrong and I pointed out that it was drenched in dressing and had bacon on it, which means I couldn't eat it. She said \"oh, the dressing was supposed to be on the side\" and then she SET MY BILL IN FRONT OF ME. Are you kidding me?!? She served me food TWICE that I couldn't eat, she blamed me for one error and admitted to the other error and still thought that billing me $15 for a half a salad was a good idea? So we ask for the manager. When he originally came over, he had attitude about it as well because the server told him that I had misordered and that's why they had to remake the salad. When we explained the whole situation, he totally understood that it was the servers fault and even bagged on her for not manning up to making the mistake in the first place. He went ahead and took care of my bill, which is the only reason for the 2 star review. Bottom line-that server should be terminated. She made the mistake, she tried to blame the customer (loudly enough that every customer in the joint could hear her) and then made another mistake and didn't own up to any of it?!? Ridiculous! In the end, I won't be back. Neither will my coworkers. The manager tried to make it right, but one right doesn't fix three wrongs."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Servers are really sweet. But the hostess's are super unprofessional. I didn't feel welcomed like I should have been , when I walked in. Overall though, I highly recommend the food here :) super yummy , just beware of the rude hostess's. Don't allow them to ruin your experience."}
{"text":"I've never had a negative experience, from the food to the laid back ambiance, friendly staff and deliciously crafted good-- it's worth any lengthy wait for a table, which you may encounter on a Sunday morning.   My personal lunch favorite is the gladiator burger. The red chile cheese sauce is mouth watering. P.s., ask for Haley-- she's the greatest!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Substitute the toast for the whole wheat pancake and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Big portions and so much variety!"}
{"text":"Great location. Friendly professional service. Sass made a tremendous recommendation of the Flannel Hash Benedict with the sautéed squash and mushrooms side. OMG they were fantastic together. Wife had tender and delicious chicken and waffles. Enough for leftovers.  You cannot make a better choice for breakfast.  I'LL BE BACK"}
{"text":"If your in the area stop by , this place is awesome and the people are great . Erica and Andrea behind the bar friendly and will greet you with a smile . This place gets packed with people so timing is everything . But it's worth the time to eat great healthy food !"}
{"text":"After five visits, the service keeps getting worse. I thought I'd try take out to avoid that but even that person was just plain angry. I'm a server too, and I LOVE my job and use my hour with people to make others days better... Maybe try that?"}
{"text":"Awesome place to dine. One word to describe this place: Welcoming. From the hostess, to the waiting staff, the clean, positive atmosphere, this restaurant is 10 out a 10 in my book. Located off of Highland Ave minutes from the Bitmore, this down-to-earth eatery is very well priced, serves spectacular food with good portions and even offers our heroes in uniform a military discount (but only active duty).   Great for family outings and date night (or mornings).  I enjoyed my breakfast here, to the fullest. Satisfaction guaranteed."}
{"text":"Brunch or Drunch, you really can never go wrong with the Dos!  We had breakfast nachos (Ridiculous!), regular nachos, bacon and eggs, French toast and a cheeseburger!  Yeah, that's brunch!  Dog friendly too!!"}
{"text":"We've had good experiences here before, but today didn't cut it. We sat at the bar so we could watch some Sunday football. The bartender greeted us quickly and got our drink order. The Bloody Mary I ordered was horrible. Very watered down and tasted like they put a shot of olive juice in it. I asked if she could spice it up which she tried to do. It didn't help. I ordered the southwestern wrap, it was ok. The avocado's were not ripe and had seed peal left on them. My husband had a burger..it was ok, nothing great.  Overall, service wasn't up to par nor was the food...to many other good choices around. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you come here for brunch on a Saturday, be prepared to wait, yet their delicious coffee that is available for free in the waiting area makes it worth waiting.   We were 7 of us and I'll highlight the general experience, but I'll focus on my dish more than others'. I ordered the turkey sausage white out off of the health nut section. I substituted the toast with butternut squash. The meal also comes with fruit.   Tasty, delicious, healthy and filling. I enjoyed it Thoroughly and cleaned my plate. It was a busy day, but service was pretty consistent. I also ordered pomegranate green tea and it was refreshed and replenished in a timely manner. One thing that was disappointing is that my meal came with no fruit and server noticed it right away and instead of bringing a bowl of fruit, took my large bowl of butternut squash,  and came back with a smaller bowl of butternut squash and a large bowl of fruit. Didn't make sense to me, but wasn't the end of the world. All in all the food is delicious, and service was consistent."}
{"text":"Breakfast delicious, service was excellent, our server even offered us a to go cup for their ice tea (unlimited refills). The outside patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"Great place, nice to have a little local bar in the neighborhood that instantly fits in with the local flavor. I have been there many times already in just the short time they have been open. The, staff are all very attentive and friendly. The food is good and averagly priced. A great little place to stop by after work."}
{"text":"Well.... being we are regulars here and we love it I'm very sad to update my review. But today we had a pretty negative experience here with the service. We eat here I'd say 3 times a week. Every Saturday for sure. We have grown to know many of the people working there including the manager. Today we came in about 915am it wasn't super busy but there wasn't many tables. The girl that works the door is just not friendly and every time we go in a I get a rather rude vibe from her. Well she tells us \"i need a min\" not hello or anything just that. So they sat another table and came back to seat us. Now the host didn't set us the manager did. Aaron. So he offers us a table in the middle of the restaurant, my boyfriend and I wanting to enjoy our breakfast and having some business we were looking to go over we asked if we could wait for a booth. Aaron seemed to be annoyed by our request. So we went back to the front to wait. We got seated at a new booth. We sat for about 5 to 10 mins and  Aaron finally brought over some water for us not saying a thing just dropping it on the table in a rude manner and walking off. So at this point being we come here all the time we didn't need to look at the menu we were ready to order but the waitress who we both saw the waitress get drinks as take everyone else's table. I let it go the first time. But the 2nd time she came to our section she attended every table and yet again walked right by us not saying a thing. At this point I'm annoyed and say to my boyfriend I feel like i want to leave we have been here 20 mins at this table with a server walking past us 3 times not acknowledging us one time I just want to leave. Well Aaron either overhearing me say this or just seeing our body language came over to say \"has anyone taken your drink order?\" Me saying \"no no one has said a thing to us since we sat here\" my boyfriend asks me at that point if I want to leave. I say \"yes\" Aaron did say at that time. \"Ill get something going for you guys\" I told him no thank you. You see us 2 or more times a week and this is the service you give. He said sorry and seemed to not be happy about us leaving but at this point we were hungry had been here for 40 mins and no sign of being able to eat or even order. The demeanor of the host and the manager seemed off and rude. We are very nice people and were just blown away. I'm sad to do this update but today our view changed on the service here and there are other daily doses we will go to from here on out."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was fairly average and the service on the morning I was there was not exactly the best. We waited a while for a table, then did not place our orders for a while afterward. Once our orders were placed, tables around us that arrived after us received their food before we did. When we got our food, we agreed that the food was just average in quality. Not bad, but nothing to go crazy over. I would be willing to give this restaurant another shot."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Been here 4-5 times in the last 6 months, same exact expereince each time.  Waiters/waitresses disappear into the back and sneak back out without making eye contact to provide the absolute minimum service required.  I don't understand how this place is still open."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here.  Great salads, great sandwiches, and a very good drink/bar selection.  It is a nice bonus that they served breakfast all day on the weekends too."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. Couldn't decide on what I really wanted and the waitress was extremely helpful. The pancakes are AMAZING! Probably the best I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Normally, I go into these places and then look over the ho-hum menu and get something typical like a burger, but this place has a really exciting menu with all sorts of somewhat unusual food combos.  I'd like to keep coming back and trying them all, frankly, as some of them sounded really interesting. Had the chicken nachos--which certainly was loaded with diced chicken--and felt positively stuffed afterwards.  Granted, I could have boxed up half of it and brought it home but what fun is that?  I can't say it was the best nacho dish I ever had (let's face it, it's all the sloppy sour cream and cheese that makes it sooo fattening but good)...but it WAS filling.  Very.  You get ALOT for your money here of nutritious chicken anyway...good deal!  And not all that fattening since they don't heap on sour cream and cheese but alot of healthy chicken.  Good dish for dieters. Good happy hour menu which lasts from 4-8pm with $2.75 domestic beers on the menu. Good service here, by the way.  Nice people serving a tremendous crowd with a smile no less.  Can't beat that for an evening out."}
{"text":"Seated fast and the service was solid.  We were a large group and it was just after 8am.  Went with the breakfast nacho plate along with my friend.  Everyone in the group seemed to enjoy eating our dishes more than their own.  Some did not even finish what they ordered....soda was flat 4 out of 4 glasses too."}
{"text":"This place is good! Our server was andrea and she was great. We were seated right away, and though we took forever to decide what we wanted, once we ordered our food hit the table in under 10 minutes. I think my only complaint was that my coffee mug was pretty dirty, but other then that everything was delicious. Not my go to, but always a good place when you want to switch it up!"}
{"text":"I don't have a negative thing to say about Daily Dose!  I eat here at least once a month for brunch and have brought friends and family alike, all of whom love it now too. It's biking distance from my house, but so is Snooze and let's just say I have only been there once.   The staff at Daily Dose is super friendly, quick and even when there is a wait, they provide free (delicious) coffee.  The food is amazing as well, and being as I have Celiac Disease, the fact they offer gluten free pancakes is basically a dream come true!  This has become and will likely stay my go-to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Came here with a work associate for lunch and was blown away by the quality of the food and quick service! There aren't a ton of great-tasting establishments in this area, so when you find one, it really stands out. This place is one of them.  I ordered a Daily Dose Burger with Chipotle Mac & Cheese. The burger was cooked exactly as I had asked and was very flavorful. Whatever sauce they put on it is hands down the best complement to a burger I've seen or tasted. Now on to the mac & cheese: right amount of kick with a creamy/cheesy consistency that rivaled some of my favorite soul food restaurants. Our server Kylie was super attentive and always made sure our experience was the best it can be. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch again in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've eaten here here five times since they opened and every meal has been delicious.  I've had the Mediterranean salad, Cobb salad with crab cakes on top, turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Crab cake sandwich and an omelet.  What is great is you can get breakfast anytime.  Give the establishment a chance to work out a few kinks AND read the menu - very descriptive."}
{"text":"Delicious food. There was a mistake with our order last time and the manager went above and beyond to rectify the mistake."}
{"text":"Everything on this menu looks so darn good. I was debating bt the hangover sandwich and the mixed berry pancakes. Waitress suggested sandwich bc she doesn't like waffles. Apparently I picked the two most popular items.  Sandwich just ok. I thought it would have been more bold in flavor after reading the descrip - bacon, sausage, aioli type sauce, caramelized jalapeños and onions. Nothing really stood out to me.  But that won't stop me from going back to try others.  Saw a pic of the breakfast nachos and they look AMAZING.  Another  waitress said it was the best thing in the menu so will have to see how legit that recommendation is. Will have to try that and my pancakes next time.  They have this ginger snap granola that I got to sample. Pretty yummy considering I am not a fan of granola.  Service was interesting. In the beg and all the way up to when our food was served, we had people constantly checking up on us. But once our food was served, I only saw our waitress once during the entire meal.  Not even the other two people who were so good about helping us. It took forever to find one of them to get our check. And we had sat there for a good 5-10 minutes after we finished eating. Weird inconsistency.  We'll see how it goes the 2nd time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I just don't make it out to breakfast often enough...but we recently decided to try this place as we happened to be in the area.  What a great little spot!   I ordered the poblano and polenta cakes eggs Benedict and I really enjoyed it.  I am a savory breakfast gal and I love anything with a Mexican flare.  I wasn't a huge fan of their potatoes...there was an herb in there I wasn't digging.  But that's just personal preference. I also tried some of my hubby's biscuits and gravy which were very good and very unique.   Good sized portions and good prices.  The kids enjoyed waffles and pancakes so I got to sample both and they were both DELICIOUS!  Obviously this was a splurge kind of day but they have many healthy options and I look forward to returning to try them out.   Service was friendly and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came in today to grab a quick bite with my mom. We sat at the bar and were greeted by Andrea who was a great bartender! She provided some recommendations and was friendly. I went with the Mint Strawberry salad...SO good! The salad is huge and they don't skimp on any of the ingredients whether it's the mint, strawberries, gorgonzola or almonds. My mom had the Southwestern Chopped; it was good but I'd suggest adding chicken to it for more flavor.  The overall atmosphere was good; it wasn't crowded, had a nice breeze from the patio and it was clean.   I'm giving the Midtown Daily Dose 4 stars only because I haven't tried enough of the food to really push that 5 star button."}
{"text":"We had a last minute call-in/take-out lunch order for 17 people.  JenLyn and the crew were able to accommodate our order.  The food was great and the people just as awesome.  Thanks JenLyn!"}
{"text":"I give 3.5 stars for breakfast.  Never had lunch or dinner.  Great breakfast place, Turkey Sausage Omelette,  Hangover Sandwich and Southwest Breakfast wrap are my favorites.  One of the few god breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from my office and is in a very convenient location in proximity to the Biltmore area.   I really enjoyed myself and the burger that I ordered, and based on the diet I'm on they were super accommodating separating it out for me the way that I needed it (annoying, I know, it's temporary).  The waitress was very sweet and the place was super clean.    I will be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Once of my favorite places to go.  Love to split a couple of the dishes for breakfast.... super coffee.   The decor is fantastic.  Have never been disappointed with the service... always excellent."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   The decor is beautiful, the food is good and their specialty drinks are incredible.  They have a very nice patio.  The staff and bartenders were very friendly and even other customers here seem very friendly.  This is very close to my home and I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I had a spicy bloody mary, the polenta and pablano eggs benedict, all very very tasty.  I will definately come here again."}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience ever.  The bartender slash server slash, woke up hung over smelled like alcohol had last nights party make up on, was not only rude but very un attentive.  It was almost like I was a burden for her....  Thankfully the food was great.  But I would NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone looking for a great service type of experience. And the host...  Don't even get me started. She was terribly rude.  Her face and demeanor said it all when  We walked in.  and being from and In the industry I get it...  But she needs to learn what the industry is.  horrible front of the house staff! terrible first impression!  This place needs help! I will continue to go there and bring friends.  And if this kind of behavior is acceptable...  Especially what a great location you have...    We shall see how long it takes till ur establishment falls to pieces. Weed out the weak links before ur weeded out.  Terrible terrible terrible...  See u soon"}
{"text":"I would give this place more stars but they took off my favorite entrée,  the chicken and biscuits.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"Place was packed for brunch, but luckily our friends arrived first and picked up a table before we showed up.  It was super busy, but the staff attended to us in a timely manner.  Poor waitress had to keep coming back, because we were chatting instead of looking for something to order. Two of us had the Hangover sandwich, one friend ordered the Crabby omelette ,and I had the Southwest Flannel Hash.  Everyhing was pleasantly devoured.  Really liked my hash dish.  Should have ordered some biscuits to go with it...and some bacon.  Buddy and I ordered bacon bloody marys.  They were ok.  They lacked some zing.  Should have asked for them to be spicy.    Good spot for breakfast for brunch.  Think everyone else knows that too, so be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I had the soft pretzels and chorizo mac and cheese.  I was really looking forward to moist soft pretzels with some great cheese... the cheese was watery and was not enough for the very dry pretzel.  It really needed salt and butter to make it taste more than just plain bread, or much more cheese to dip it in.  The chorizo mac and cheese sounded delicious and like it would be somewhat spicy, but it was VERY bland.  When I added salt, it wasn't as bad... but it was still very meh.  Not remotely spicy or flavorful.  For the price (I spent 18 bucks on these two things), I've definitely had better.  Which bums me out, I've been wanting to try this place since they opened as their menu sounded delicious, with many things that I thought I would love.  Happy hour prices were meh.  5 dollar margaritas, 3.75 well, which are comparable or more expensive than any other bar in the area.  Not really worth my time again, and glad I didn't take my boyfriend as he would have likely complained about paying for that.  Did not try the breakfast... which is what everyone seems to be raving about.  If you're going, try it for that but skip the dinner menu for sure."}
{"text":"J and I went here for a quick breakfast the day after Christmas.  We had Baby C in tow with us.    Can I just say that our waitress was AWESOME!!!  I was changing Baby C's diaper in the bathroom and well, let's just say that his whole outfit needed to be changed.  Oh and the ladies bathroom had a diaper changing station!  So helpful for patrons with little ones still in diapers!  Anyway....By the time I finished cleaning him up and got back to our table.  Our food had already been dropped off.  BUT, my food was no where in sight.  The waitress asked J if she could put my order back up on the pass so it would stay hot.  So when I got back to our table, a minute later, my breakfast arrives.    My breakfast - Peanut Butter and Jelly Pancakes!  Super tasty!    As we were getting ready to leave, I asked our waitress if we could have to go cups for our drinks (my water and J's soda).  She not only brought cups, but they were filled with our beverages.    Seriously awesome grub and service!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good, the service is attentive, and coffee outstanding.  You must try the Banana Bread French Toast or the Strawberry Belgian Waffle! We are always seated quickly aand drinks offfered right away. This is a must-visit place!"}
{"text":"Second brunch here. The menu is varied and hits most tastes. The steak and eggs is wonderful looking, plan to try next visit. Had the DD hash which is really something. Group of four covered the gamut for entries and all were happy. We had a Creme Brûlée pancake that we all shared and it was wonderful. Staff is extremely helpful and prompt Note this is a busy place and if you show at 11 AM on a Sunday there will be a bit of a wait, however it is worth it! Seats in the dining room are great but sitting at the bar is fun as well. Give these guys a visit, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great all around! Excellent service, as well as lots of delicious drinks and foods to choose from. Went for brunch at 12pm on a Sunday and there was no wait; we were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Last week was my chance.  Some friends wanted to grab dinner, so we decided on Daily Dose Midtown.  When we arrived it was pretty quiet. It was a Saturday night so I was a little surprised.  Our waitress was nice but slightly flaky.  Every time we asked her a question and she didn't know the answer, she tried to guess the answer rather than just asking someone. Especially when it came to a friend asking about something she is allergic to. She gave us incorrect information on the portion size of an appetizer and she forgot a few things like my friends beer and then said \"Oh that's my fault\" when he asked if it was coming.  This all went on when it was pretty slow so that to me is either a sign of someone new (which that didn't seem to be the case) or someone just being lazy because it's a slow night.  Her personality was a bit too casual too.  Just enough to be boarder line unprofessional. Not a big deal, it was just noticeable.    The food was ok.  I had a hamburger and I asked for it Medium,  I got what seemed to me to be medium well or even well done. There wasn't any pink at all.  The pretzel bun also seemed kind of dry.  At this point I wasn't going to bother bringing it up to the waitress.    What all seem like bad things, I just had a feeling it was the staff of that night.  The following week some coworkers wanted to go there for lunch so we did.  I figured this would give me an idea of this place.  Right off the service was MUCH better.  Our waitress was attentive and got everything right.  Just her demeanor and professionalism seemed a lot better. The food improved too and it was all in all a better experience.  I think our first time here was a case of the lazy restaurant workers who just didn't want to be there on a Saturday night.   Would I recommend?  Yes, give it a try.  I think I really want to try brunch."}
{"text":"My first time to DD. Nice patio seating and easy parking, nice location. Wednesday am, not too busy. I ordered the orange juice and it was fresh squeezed and delicious as promised. I ordered the strawberry and cream waffle. Soooo good! I really liked the pastry pastry cream on the waffle and a nice rich whiped cream. It was wonderful and not too sweet.  I wasn't crazy about the sausage patties but I'm into more spicy vs herbaceous.   My friend had the chicken enchiladas and loved em! Especially since they were done on flour tortillas. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I went there more.  Great happy hour draft specials.  Not just bud or coors, but real microbrews on tap.  Never had a bad meal there, I highly recommend the veggie omelet for breakfast and the chicken nachos and a beer during happy hour."}
{"text":"I went here with my boss one time and even though the food was good, I was extremely confused because of the hours this restaurant has. They have very odd hours and if I remember correctly, they aren't open on weekend either. They must make all of their money during lunch breaks. I probably wouldn't go here often even though it is right around the corner from my work."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3.5/5 Happiness - 4/5  Along with Snooze, Daily Dose is one of my go-to spots for breakfast. Daily Dose has a pretty extensive (and delicious) lunch menu in addition to its breakfast offerings. One of my personal favorite items is their rosemary potatoes with some incredibly delicious crème fraiche (plus, crème fraiche reminds me of that South Park episode - another plus). While nothing overly stands out, you get a high-quality meal in a clean atmosphere (no sticky, syrup-smelling tables here) with a staff that always is friendly.  The only caveat, be ready for a wait. The location is a bit small and during rush hour, there is often a line out the door. They usually have free water and coffee while you wait, which is very considerate."}
{"text":"My new weekend breakfast joint! Love this location and a friendly staff that's always helpful and ready to serve you.  For breakfast, I've had the egg Benedict.  The first time the eggs were cooked perfectly, but the second time a bit over done.  Still yummy and worth the cost.  The biscuits and gravy were ok, not the best and a bit odd in taste-needed salt or seasoning.  I have not tried out their happy hour at this location.  I've tried it at Scottsdale location which I wasn't really impressed.  This location however, I really like and will keep going!"}
{"text":"I'll def be back. I really liked there coffee normally I dont like breakfast joint coffee. I liked the breakfast nachos and my son enjoyed his kids meal large portion for only $5"}
{"text":"Been here many times and continue to receive the same excellent service and consistently amazing food, never to disappoint. The servers are always pleasant, professional, fun and provide fantastic recommendations. As a result, my list of favorites continue to grow. Always looking forward to our next visit. Keep up the great work. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, huge selection so it can accommodate a big party with lots of different tastes. Quick, easy and affordable"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Beautiful decor with very interesting architecture and an outdoor patio; fast, friendly service; excellent food, great looking staff. ... I'm surprised it was so easy to get a seat! But it was pouring rain, so that maybe why. ... The Flannel corn beef was excellent, and is homemade, not the kind that comes in a can from far away. I ordered eggs poached soft and YES, they came out soft, just right! ... Coffee (Americano) was great too. ... OH! And they have hooks under the counter and good Wifi!"}
{"text":"I grabbed dinner and some brews at Daily Dose Midtown with my friend last night. Great food, great beers, great prices! The burger was exquisite, and with the happy hour prices going 4-9 daily, my adoration for places like Smashburger is in peril. I'm looking forward to future meals at Daily Dose, and plan on returning super soon!"}
{"text":"They have the best mimosa ! We usually come here after work for breakfast and drinks. They are very friendly and food is great."}
{"text":"I would recommend the huevos rancheros. I don't know what I was expecting but it was incredible. The bean salsa was so amazing. My daughter had the turkey sausage and polenta bowl which she enjoyed very much. The service was also exceptional."}
{"text":"First time to this location and it was ok.  Customer service was nice they were friendly and outgoing. The food however, was missing a lot of flavor. Last time I came to daily dose (Scottsdale location) I ordered the eggs Benedict which I thought were pretty tasty. This time I ordered the turkey sausage omelette with house potatoes and fruit. The house potatoes definitely tasted frozen and some were half way cooked, which wasn't very pleasant. The omelette lacked a lot of flavor, it was extremely bland. I ordered  coffee and not bad (since I am the pickiest when it comes to coffee). My partner ordered a bacon burger and his too lacked a lot of seasoning.    They have a small bar once you walk in and also have a patios to sit outdoors. Currently they are remodeling the frys next door so there's a lot of construction in that are (parking can be a hassle)  All in all daily dose is an ok place I would only stick to eggs Benedict from now on if i were to come back here."}
{"text":"Went here for my weekly breakfast adventure. The wait was really short although it seemed like we hit the hostess stand at the right time. We were seated and served our large coffee relatively quick. Let me emphasize the large coffee cups they provide.   Raymond was our waiter and he was very helpful and truly a pleasure. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash which was fantastic. My first question was.... Do they make their own? He said \"yes, we roast it fresh in house.\" Fresh it was! Fantastic, I would recommend that to any Corned Beef Lovers!   I will be back and appreciate their offerings. I might need to come back for the Banana Bread French Toast. YUM"}
{"text":"Just took a trip saw my parents in AZ, we stopped by here on the way to the PHX Airport, and it was a GREAT MEAL!   They have a small waiting area with free coffee and cucumber water. There is outdoor seating with heaters (t was cold and raining) and in door seating. The place at first looks small, but I went to the bathroom and it's quite large.   Our server Susan was excellent. They serve double size mugs of coffee and CUCUMBER WATER!   I got the hash, I would give 3.5 stars, just because it was different than I was expecting, but it was 100% unique. It kind of reminded me of soft brisket. The Toast is the kind you get other places, I got Rye, but they served homemade jam. It reminded me of crush blackberry with no added sugar, VERY GOOD.   I tried some Tempeh my Mom got it was good, and then I got some of my Dad's potatoes, which were tasty.   I would 100% eat here again, they have many unique menu items and as Susan said, everything is made in HOUSE, so that's a reason TO GO! =)"}
{"text":"Pretty much the rudest host ever!! How long is the wait \"I don't know!\" What kind of answer is that. Said he didn't have a table for 5 asked if we could do a four top pull up a high chair and he said \"I just said I don't have a table!\" Ummm you said you didn't have a table for 5 not 4!?!? Seriously completely rude and unwelcoming and we haven't even sat down down.  **waitress and food awesome -update"}
{"text":"First time going to this hidden corner gem. Walking in to smiles and a long breakfast/drink bar....we were seated quickly...drinks came out in less than 30 Seconds...orders were placed and food came out looking and tasting fresh and professional. Great prime rib dip sandwich on pretzel bun and my wife got the chopped salad...added chicken. Reasonable prices...will be going back again."}
{"text":"Miss Sass, our waitress, made our experience that much better. She was knowledgeable, always smiling, helpful and fast! She helped us order the right dishes and drinks to compliment each other. The food was incredible, had so much bursting flavor with every bite and we had no problem licking our plates clean. Our next Arizona trip, we will return with the whole family! :)"}
{"text":"I was craving pancakes or waffles for breakfast (a very rare occasion--i'm more of an omelette + potatoes girl) and ended up here. They have quite a few selections for pancakes, waffles, and belgian waffles on the menu. I got the strawberries and chocolate pancakes (minus the whipped cream) with butter squash hash, aka the DD hash. The pancakes were alright at best, and they literally put thin slices of strawberries in between the layers of the pancake which, IMO, made it soggy at the end. The DD hash was unique and I enjoyed the flavor.   The service was quick, there are seats indoors, by the bar, and out in the patio. There's also plenty of parking. After looking over their comprehensive menu more, I'd be back again and try one of the omelettes that they're famous for."}
{"text":"First off the food is mediocre. The bacon was burnt and fell into ashes when you bit it.  The coffee was yummy tho. I had the 'filthy chi' Our server was either tired, angry or indifferent.  I I I can't tell which. We had the 'pleasure' of having her at both of our visits and it was the same.  She would drop off the food without a word. We asked for jam for bread. She looked at us.  Walked away. Returned with jam. No words exchanged. Lol.  Honestly why do people work in the service industry when they can't even fake being nice.  I won't go back. The food wasn't enough to make up for the service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza and the accompanying salad during happy hour.  It was a perfectly portioned, tasty and healthy meal for around only $11.00.  We went to Daily Dose again tonight, and I was greatly looking forward to this favorite meal of mine.  Unfortunately, we learned tonight that this item had recently been removed from the menu!  I enjoy the service and the ambiance at this restaurant, as well as the moderate prices.  But, much as I stopped eating at California Pizza Kitchen after they eliminated my beloved roasted garlic chicken pizza there, I am not likely to eat at Daily Dose much in the future, as my most favorite dish there has been eliminated as well.  (Kudos, though, to the Sunday evening manager, whose name I didn't catch, as she graciously offered to attempt to specially prepare this item for me if I came back in on a Sunday.  I may just take her up on her offer...!)"}
{"text":"Wow, what a waste. So after waiting half an hour for our appetizers which one was chips and salsa we waited another half hour for food which we were told would be up shortly. We needed to go as we had somewhere to be and the rate it was going it felt like it would be another half hour before we saw our actual meal. I would think they would comp our appetizers for the inconvenience but no sure enough they brought us a bill. Lame bad start. The appetizers were mediocre at best. The guy said to give them a break because it was their 6th day open. They had at least 4 servers and 3 bussers, was their only one cook in the back? I didn't know it took 30 minutes to arrange chips on a plate! I would give this place a second chance, I will wait until they are on their 30th day open and maybe by then they will have figured a few things out about service."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a group get together, 10 people. There was adequate seating for all of us. The food was prompt, fresh, and tasted amazing.....   But when we got our bills, we were a little surprised. The drink menus on the table and the dinner menus had different prices than our bills. When I asked the waitress what was going on, she said she forgot to tell us about the price differences. The restaurant changed prices.  It was not one item but several items.   Needless to say 10 people will no longer frequent this place.Different prices from menus to bills is shady business."}
{"text":"They have super yummy food and great service! They even have turkey sausage! Everything is made fresh including the sausage."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, and great service by our server Alexis. The rest of the staff was also very attentive and made sure everything was pleasant. The portions were large and the place had a nice view in the patio area. Everything was good and tasted as expected. It was a great first experience. I'll definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Daily Dose has been on my \"to try\" list for quiet a while, and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint.  I came for brunch on Fourth of July. They had some delicious sounding cocktails and great beers on tap. Unfortunately, I had to go home and study after breakfast so I did not partake. But the happy hour menu looked great, and I will definitely be back to try that. Although I did notice beers are $4 during happy hour, which seems a little high for happy hour. On the bright side, wine is $5 or you can get a bottle for $18. And happy hour is everyday from 4pm to 8pm. If only every happy hour was that long!  I ordered the breakfast nachos- chorizo, eggs, and cheese on tortilla chips. The nachos themselves were pretty good, but a little on the cold side. The portion size is also ridiculous--you could definitely share it with another person. It comes with a side of sausage gravy, which I thought would be weird, but not only was it delicious with the nachos, it was just as good by itself. I will definitely order the biscuits and gravy next time, just so I can have more of that gravy!   My boyfriend ordered the cinnamon apple pancakes. He is a bit of a pancake snob, but he loved these. He was generous enough to share a bite with me, and they are definitely praise worthy. It was like eating apple pie in pancake form.  Our server was great even though she was also working behind the bar. All in all, it was a great breakfast, and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"4 star review only because the waitress messed up my whole breakfast order, but the food is always good.  Get there expecting to wait, there is always a wait time.  Great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"This place has a great bar and large selection of alcohol. The food is delish and my server was very nice.  The hostess seems a bit severe but was very professional."}
{"text":"The wine wasn't very good. I found their new cabernet to be too tart.  I liked the interior decor. Especially that wooden panel wall that you see when you first walk in.  The tables are nice and artsy. I like the lights that they have, trendy but not too pretentious about it.   The happy hour menu is nice, gives you lots of choices.   The regular menu is ok, I had a hard time deciding on something because there just seemed to be something off about all the dishes. I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that didn't click with me.  The server recommended two dishes, I picked the chicken and waffles combo she liked. It came out and the spicy chicken was good, but the jalapeno waffles were way too heavy for that dish. I couldn't eat more than a few bites because it was so heavy.  The Caesar salad came with tomatoes, and it really made the salad good. Too much Parmesan, but that's being picky.  Service was fine, someone new was training in so we had two different people working our booth.   The food and menu were average overall, the execution is just off at this place."}
{"text":"So their portebello brie fondu appetizer is so delicious. It kinda just tastes like very good creme of mushroom soup. The veggies it comes with is three slices of tomatoes, carrots, and cucumber.  Their pretzels and cheese is pretty okay. Hardly comes with enough cheese sauce and it costs 75 cents to get more cheese....  However, if you order the chips with salsa and guac, you can have unlimited amount of chips."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time for breakfast with my daughter. Service was great. I had the crab cake eggs benedict and my daughter had the kids' pancake stack. A little bit pricey, but for the food and service definitely worth it. Will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, the berry pancakes with banana and grain are so good. I'll definitely be back.  I can see where the waiting staff might have some timing issues. There seemed to be an overly relaxed vibe amongst the staff which left me scratching my head.  But the food more then made up for it and they did pay attention to detail."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is they have happy hour until 730pm! The patio is great and the service was prompt. The portions are humongous and the food was good too. The food wasn't amaaaazing but it was good. My boyfriend got a massive plate of nachos and I got a BLT with sweet potato fries. If you're looking for a good happy hour place to eat and have some drinks in this area, I'd recommend here."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service.  They make their own salad dressings, plus.  Slice of cucumber in the water, classy.  The Daily Dose burger was perfectly cooked - the fries mediocre but the rest made up for it.  With all the breakfast reviews can't wait to come back to try something (before 4 pm)"}
{"text":"Food is so so. Probably not coming back since I just paid 10 dollars for two glasses of orange juice. Ridiculous. This isn't brunch at the Wrigley mansion."}
{"text":"Daily Dose used to be open for dinner,  but now they are a breakfast and lunch only type of place. They have great options for breakfast and brunch, and great burgers and salads  if you are interested in lunch fare. The servers are always nice and the atmosphere is casual. They have a nice patio to sit on and interior seating. Parking is always easy as well."}
{"text":"We have been going here every weekend for the last 6 years where the bar is open seating. Last month, the hotess said you have to be on the waiting list even for the bar. Last weekend, that wasn't the case. And now, the rule is back on. We like the food but it's not worth the yo-yo policy. Pick a policy and stick with it. In our opinion, the bar area should be first come first serve."}
{"text":"Just what the neighborhood needed: A family restaurant open long hours with a real bar and a nice patio.  Breakfast menu features a nice selection of omeletes and pancakes among other things. It's served until 4PM. The coffee is very good.   It's not cheap, but you tend to get what you pay for.  No real downside perceived here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I only gave this daily does 4 stars because although I still absolutely LOVED my meal and continue to dream about it daily, I did not LOVE this location as much at the Old Town location. I found that the Old Town location puts much more love and care into their work from the plating to the serving.   Now for the food, this is my #1 breakfast restaurant ever hands down!!!!!!!   GET THE Breakfast Tostada Benedict... It will change your life!! I dream about this meal daily!  Honorable mention to the filet Benedict and also the steak bowl!! Either way everyhing is amazing and delicious!  If you are in Phoenix this is THE PLACE to get breakfast! And is totally worth going out of your way like I made my fiance do for me!  But the old town is the best location for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, consistently great service & wait is never too long (earlier the better on the weekend). We go here at least twice a month even though we live further away than we used to. Have tried many other breakfast places in the area, but return to DD when we really just want a great breakfast we can count on."}
{"text":"Daily Dose midtown is a huge disappointment, gave this place a second chance and it is our last. Service couldn't be worse. Most of the staff doesn't seem to care about it's customers or the place itself. This place seemed night and day compared to the Old Town location. Better pick it up or Snooze will hurt their biz for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for Easter morning brunch. We were seated with no wait, but sat for a good 10 minutes before addressed.  When the waitress approached, we were ready to order coffee and breakfast. We both had regular coffee, served piping hot in giant mugs. I also ordered a sugar free white chocolate syrup, which was tasty.  For breakfast my husband had the hangover sandwich. He loved it, and the potatoes that accompanied his sandwich. I had the straight shooter with 2 eggs, meat, fruit and 2 pancakes. I had turkey sausage which was delicious. The star was definitely the pancakes. I had protein pancakes with blueberries. I paid the extra buck for real maple syrup (totally worth it) but the pancakes had such great flavor and texture they didn't require syrup. All in all, a wonderful meal that will tide us over until dinner. Our orders were correct and food was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for any time of the day. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. The food is consistently good, staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is clean and very nice. It's a bit pricey-er than other places in the area, but you get what you pay for.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Huge menu and big portions at a reasonable price. Decent kid's menu, too. This place was great and we will return.   P.S. try the chicken nachos!"}
{"text":"I went to this place twice in two days.  The first day I sat at a table and was served quickly and the food was hot, right off the griddle  The server was very attentive and conversational.  The next day I sat at the counter and the server behind the bar (hard to label her a \"bartender\" at 8:00 AM) was very engaging and friendly.  Again, the food was served quickly and was right off the griddle and the coffee was fresh and hot.    The menu is unique with several great options.  If you're in the area and haven't tried this place, find it.  This place is definitely worth finding."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast. My personal favorite is the breakfasts nachos. The waitress even informed me it was ranked in the nation. Which was interesting. They have some great selections for coffee as well as bar. I would recommend this place to anyone in Phoenix looking to get some good grub!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and location. The wait staff is friendly and accommodating. The food was a bit pricey for the quality. I ordered the Poblano Benedict or something like that.  It was   generally lacking on flavor.  The breakfast potatoes were over spiced and over cooked.  The turkey sausage was not seasoned and rather bland.  Coffee was great. I'd cautiously try again."}
{"text":"Love this location! If snooze is busy, just come here! Just come here anyway!! They always seem to have space! Awesome servers, love Sass! Turkey Sausage Polenta bowl is to die for! Great bloody marys, dog friendly patio! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Waffles and the delish hash are the things to eat. Go early for breakfast to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"A regular spot for family dinner, love the service and the Mac and Cheese is incredible! Great atmosphere and the menu has a bit of something for everyone. I highly recommend the cinnamon roll with ice cream, oh and the cilantro lime salad dressing (on a salad, not the cinnamon roll) is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to the old town location a couple weeks ago and was impressed. Today we went to the other location. Food was still good. But service was lacking. I think it was just because they were super busy and didn't have as many staff working as the other location. So our server was also the bartender.  We waited maybe 20 mins. Wasn't too bad. We split the breakfast nachos. Which is amazing by the way. We probably should have just had that. But husband had some pancakes and I had eggs Benedict with turkey sausage.  Nachos were my fav. Melted cheese and gooey cheese. Chorizo scrambled eggs. Pico and sausage gravy. Yum"}
{"text":"Costumer service was slow. Took 15 minutes to get our waitress and 15 minutes for our drinks to come.  South west wrap, my sister like her wrap, but needs a hint of spice, she said.  Banana bread french toast, grandma said it was so sweet. The sauce was drenched when she got it. Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys. She liked her bowl of fruit better.  Veggie Omlette with potatoes. VEGGIE, yeah. No veggies. More of cheese and egg whites. didn't finish it. It was too bland, but tapitio and ketchup made it better.  Haha.. my potato was over cooked and had so much season on it. My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale. Im over all disappointed.. shrugs.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Daily Dose has decided to start using cheaper ingredients and has really gone downhill.  They changed their house made turkey sausage for the worse (tastes overcooked, old, frozen) the last 3 times I have been in, so it has not been a 1 time thing.  Last few times have been disappointing, which is a shame as this was once a great breakfast place.  With so many other good options close by, I do not believe we will be making another return visit"}
{"text":"This is the best brunch I've ever had. The service was incredible (long wait, but I can see why), the drinks were great (who doesn't love a good mimosa) and the food was heavenly. I enjoyed the eggs benedict and it was hands down the best I've eaten. Will be returning here for brunch again."}
{"text":"Great place for the price, food is above good. But a fun place for chillin with friends..."}
{"text":"Always great food!! I luv that they have happy hour 7 days a week. This is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to meet here for brunch. I had never even heard of this place and wasn't sure what to expect. It was extremely busy, we weren't able to get a table on the patio and were seated toward the back of the restaurant. Waitress was friendly and quick. However, I was not impressed with their food. It was way overpriced for what we were served. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great disappointment :( We heard this place was great, but experienced nothing great. The Chorizo mac and cheese was mediocre at best. The Shrimp quesadilla was horrible. To add salt to wound, the table we sat at had ANTS. My 6 year old killed them as we waited for the phone. We notified the waitress and the manager. You'd think they would have comp'ed at least an appetizer. Nope. Nothing for the inconvenience of having unwelcome visitors at the table."}
{"text":"About as pleasantly memorable as a fart in an Elevator this eatery is shining tribute to mediocrity in absolutely every possible vantage point.    The brunch crowd is able to enjoy commentary coffee while waiting and Ostensibly cold ice tea--upon closer inspection the ice tea has a small label \"cucumber water\" and after tasting the water one is instantly certain two things : 1) disappointment and 2) the complete absence of anything remotely cucumber involved in the garden hose quality H20 labeled in , again I giant ice tea container.   This trite experience is emblematic of everything wrong with this place -- why over promise and under deliver ?   The chorizo Mac n cheese was reminiscent of hamburger helper and ass (donkey meat); I wanted so badly for the chicken nachos to live up to their picture and description but Managed to fall short.  The salmon eggs Benedict was uninspiring And came with two orders of mediocre potatoes.    Our waiter was adequate but acted put upon when we asked to move out of the sun and was completely unapologetic after mistakingly bringing us a large orange juice.    This place makes promises o plenty but is a Denny's in disguise.  I hope our experience is not repeated."}
{"text":"I finally returned to daily dose because a friend wanted to try them out, and, I must say, they were better this time. I had the breakfast burger, which was actually pretty legit.... It was covered in some kind of magical cheese sauce that made it oh so tasty. I had their hash as my side..... Didn't love it so much. The husband had the biscuits and gravy and didn't care for that either. I think the food here may be very hot and miss, with some items being really great and others falling flat, which is rough when their price point isn't so cheap. Regardless, I was glad we gave them another try."}
{"text":"OK. It's just O-K. That's the best and only way I know how to describe daily dose. After several attempts to enjoy their food, they continue fall short. I got the Benedict and the hollandaise was thin, runny and tasteless. My son had a breakfast burger and it literally had no flavor and was a huge mess. I only really find myself here when every other breakfast spot is over packed."}
{"text":"This place always has great breakfast. I have them 4 stars because of the wait time. It's not their fault that they're popular and in demand. Just can't wait more than 20 mins to be seated and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" spot for breakfasts.  The staff is family when you become a known entity to them.  Love them all equally and do not plan on looking in the new restaurants of Phoenix for a solid first meal of the day.  Service, drinks, food, and management are all stellar and a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"Cute place. Service was good, food was very good, and prices are not out of control.  Gourmet burger on a prezel bun with side for about 10 or 11 bucks, not bad.  I'd be back."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Rude customer service who acts friendly to you and then talks garbage behind your back when they do not know you are standing right behind them. Cannot process simple breakfast orders without correcting it multiple times and has no concern for their customers, most importantly, does not know how to handle food or food temperature correctly which is dangerous! The manager Emily who when I asked to contact the owner and if they had yelp, twitter etc, said have fun on your yelp endeavors. Thanks Emily, hope you enjoy it more than we enjoyed your sub par food and rude service.    ***   So where do I even begin with this one? First of all, we discovered this on Amazon prime now app to order and I was like, sweet, a place that delivers breakfast! Great when you are sick and in pain, a nice simple breakfast delivered helps to start the day out better, at least it should. So I ordered a few times from here for me and the hubby and usually it was ok, nothing spectacular, but it's breakfast, can't mess it up too bad? Well I was wrong there.   First the quality started going down, so I called it in personally instead of going  through the amazon app and had the hubby pick it up, spoke to a gentleman named Keegan I believe, and he assured me the order would be done right this time, awesome!   My hubby brings the order home and well it was the worse one we have had yet and I do not know how that was possible considering the guy said he personally checked   everything. I ordered a salmon bagel, should be cold, RAW salmon, cream cheese and some toppings for the bagel. This was put into a food bag with steaming hot food, so cold raw salmon becomes warm bacteria breeding ground, yum! I do not wish to get sick because they do not know how to properly handle raw fish. This is dangerous for regular people, however, having a weakened immune system to begin with, I would have a bad time. I called him back and explained everything, there was a few other issues, basic things that were overlooked and messed up, but it will be a novel if I go into that. So he said \"oh no we have a new guy back there and I should have checked better, etc\", come back and I will remake it perfectly this time! As it was a 20 minute drive each way, I said my husband will come back tomorrow instead. He said speak to the Manager named Emily and she will make it right for you guys.   I called Emily today, she sounded nice and apologetic over the phone and took the   order and said come in 15 minutes, great. My hubby was close to the area so he end up getting in a bit earlier and hears the manager with her back turned to him screaming to the back \"Make sure to bag everything separately, keep the hot food away from the cold food oh and attach an extra arm\" ( If you missed that, she was basically saying we are asking for the impossible and being so whiny that the chef should literally detach his own arm and include it ) So the chef proceeds to laugh, a few servers and herself. Then she turns around and my husband says \" We dont need the arm, thanks\", to which she changes her tune into oh tee hee, I did not mean it like that! Unsure how else she could have meant that, what I think she meant was, she did not mean for us to overhear her, but then again, she was yelling loud enough so that anyone in that general vicinity could hear. Her managerial skills were on point. When I called her about it, she seemed to not really care about what I had to say, was extremely flippant about the whole situation and just acted like a spoiled brat, rather than a restaurant manager.   I do not mind dealing with shitty customer service as people always have bad days, but being so rude that you do not bother to apologize for your stuck up behavior, and that you cannot get basic orders correct and make sure that food quality is up to par with your price, something needs to be fixed. 12.50$ for a bagel and cream cheese with about 1oz of warm salmon is not going to make up for your attitudes. If that is how they handle dealing with food issues, I do not even want to know what the quality is like in the kitchen and what on earth is being served to people as they do not have any basic understanding of food handling."}
{"text":"Great coffee flavor choices (maple latte) and a full bar with breakfast makes this place a brunch must.  Service is always great and the wait is never that long.  Inside or outside patio is great."}
{"text":"Most delicious pancakes I have ever had - full of fruit, fluffy, crunchy, healthy, yummy! Delightful waitress."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp.  I got the DD Bacon Bloody Mary with the Creole mix.  Wow.  Best Bloody Mary I ever had. Will come back just for that.  The food was great too."}
{"text":"This place is not that great. The line at all the other brunch areas nearby were long wait times on a Sunday afternoon so I came here because they're was no wait time. I should have taken that as a sign to leave. The food I ordered was terrible and did not taste good at all. There was absolutely no flavor and our waitress was giving us a lot of attitude like she didn't want to be there. I was very disappointed with this experience as I did not have high expectations but the standard definitely want meet and feel way below what I was paying for. My portion of the meal came to $35 so I wasn't spending chip change, so understand a little on why I was frustrated with the experience. I'd say if you hate waiting and want food quick, this place can fill that void, even though the food may not be good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here expecting much better. I had prime rib benedict and it was flavorless. My coke was flat and didn't change after 3 times of sending it back. My wife had the roasted red pepper benedict and said it was bland and wasn't impressed at all. The service however was very good."}
{"text":"I met my daughter here for late breakfast and it was our first time here. We were greeted and seated immediately, the restaurant was clean and we placed our order within 10 minutes. The food took approximately 20 minutes to arrive,not too bad. I had the chile Verde huevos ranchers, it was very dried out pork with very little chile verde. I didn't see any cilantro or sour cream with the dish. My daughter had the breakfast burger and she said it was bland. I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast as there are a lot of other great breakfast places close by."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the gracious service. We were in the midst of a family emergency and our server respectfully waited it all out - again thanks so much!! I love the food here and my pretzel bread french toast was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had anywhere. So good. But... my friend's fried chicken and waffle - the waffle looked fluffy but was dry and doughy. The huevos rancheros - interesting and good, but not great. I'll manage a 4-star review because I absolutely love the place, but some work is needed to get to a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have so many options on their menu it's hard to choose so I have to keep coming back to try new things. The last time I got the lox which was amazing. It comes with fruit and a small salad. I've had the pancakes and nachos too and they all meet expectations. Only thing I didn't like is the turkey sausage. It doesn't seem to have much taste. Kind of bland and over priced so I would get that again. Everything else including the atmosphere, outdoor seating, and service service was perfect. Definitely recommend and will go at least once or twice a month for brunch."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch with my daughter and son in law.  Nice to see the area developing again.  The place has a lot of room and is decorated nicely.  The coffee was good and hot, mimosa is a bud vase (?). I had the grain pancakes and OMG are those some dense flapjacks but they were quite tasty.  The food the hubby and others had looked good as well.  The place was jumping for sure but the staff was very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"I ordered medium rare salmon and received a rubbery overdone inedible glob of something else instead.  Later, I was surprised to note that my bill included charges for the horrible entree, although after a single bite, I brought the matter to the waitress' attention and she removed the full plate of food from our table ... To politely dispute the bill, I kindly reminded the waitress of the earlier exchange and she said that she would remove the cost of the entree from my bill.  Rather than follow thru on her promise, the waitress wrote me a note saying that she had discounted the entree by half rather than 100%!  So, what just happened there and why should the customer pay for the restaurant's error?  The booth and ladies' room lacked cleanliness as well...Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"Daily Dose has quickly become one of my favorite brunch places. The place is always slammed, but I'm usually alone so I can typically score a spot at the bar pretty quickly. I've also eaten on the patio as well as in the back part of the restaurant.   The menu has breakfast and lunch -- omelets, sandwiches, salads, etc. I love the bacon omelet. That dish is more than enough to fill you up. It comes with a side (I usually get fruit), bread (I usually get an English muffin), and choice of potato-type starch. The omelet itself has peppered bacon, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and is topped with about a quarter of an avocado -- YUM!! I usually get cranberry juice and coffee to wash it down.   On Sundays you can catch several football games on the TVs at the bar. The bartenders have always provided great service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint! The staff was awesome...almost too nice!  Breakfast nachos are insane!!!!!!  Have been a few times and haven't been disappointed once.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now, so finally did this morning. Must say first impressions are everything for a business including how their employees conduct themselves while providing customer service. Ambiance was great and inviting when we walked through the front entrance. There was not host or hostess attending the front door, but a customer who we saw walked in as we pulled in the parking lot. He was standing there patiently waiting with no acknowledgement from the moment he walked in, as we began to experience the same lack of service. I then walked back to the bar to get some service for seating for this gentlemen and our party as well only to be confronted by the rudest person in the establishment. She was rude all the way to sitting us and made it known to her fellow employees, my wife wanted to walk out and go somewhere else, but I decide to stay and ride it out and give them a chance. She made a lot of excuses and was rude even further when we requested a booth over a high top, this employee has a lack of situational awareness and forgot that this is solely a customer service driven industry. Businesses such as this on relies heavily on reviews and word of mouth such as this. She became a liability and not an asset to this business this morning, who obviously made the investment in her employment.  So part two of this review, our server was friendly and the food was delicious but a little on the cooler side. The food probably sat in the back for awhile before it came out at that temperature, which is usually the case for cooler food. So I am torn about this restaurant, which is too bad because the food tasty. I think that the management here is due for a staff meeting to tighten up the ship. The place was only half way to capacity to not have any of these device issues this morning.  There are plenty of great restaurants in this Central Phoenix area that truly nail it every time. Unfortunately this was not that day for The Daily"}
