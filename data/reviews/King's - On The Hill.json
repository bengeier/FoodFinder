{"text":"Tried it and glad we did. The freshness and flavors made the meal. The Wor wonton is awesome. The sweet and sour chicken was the best found in YYC. A return is on the horizon. The service was exceptional and the speed that food was at our table was just right"}
{"text":"Fantastic wor wonton soup ( best in the city) and dumplings   Home made hot sauce is a must !"}
{"text":"I loved the hot and sour soup, it made me feel great when I was sick. The price is good and I love the self service here. Good business . I will come back again o try more, this is a unique place !"}
{"text":"We love coming here! The food and service is always awesome, the wor wonton is a classic and always so good and fresh. The appetizers are also very yummy and a must have. The dumplings and shrimp salad rolls are my go to. Can't say enough good things about this place. I love it here. We were so happy when this second location opened up near our house. Dine in or take out, you'll never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wonton soup 
+appetizer during their $5 midday special (from 2-5pm) and it was delicious.  The broth was rich and flavourful, and the wontons were a generous size.   The shrimp dumplings were also tasty.

Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Wor won ton is what they known for.    They just introduced chicken won tons and at first I didn't think that would taste good but it was pretty good.   I like the new place Bc it's clean and tons of room.   When I tell my friends to go there I tell them they must try the Wor Won Tons.  But they do have some new dishes for those who want something else."}
{"text":"An unexpectedly great breakfast spot. The owner Angela was very friendly, the big breakfast plate was satisfying and delicious, and the atmosphere was inviting. We value great customer service and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish there were more than 5 stars to give this place!!! I never thought I'd get so excited about soup. The broth is so rich, I never imagined broth could be so perfectly seasoned and flavourful. I recommend putting a spoonful of chilli oil in your wonton soup to give it an extra kick. 

Honestly, I can't say enough about this place. So happy we found this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, Christina is so friendly and welcoming when you walk in and the food is just delicious I especially loved the sweat and sour chicken.. Definitely my go to Chinese anymore"}
{"text":"I love their banana pancakes!  And their Heavenly Hot Sauce is to die for, especially when mixed with plum sauce to go with their dumplings.  There are a lot of trendy breakfast places surrounding King's but I prefer to come here for simplicity.  Plus there's no line up and plenty of room for my kids."}
{"text":"This is the best service I've had in Canada so far. When you come in you are instantly greeted and treated as a friend. Christina (the owner) was so kind and attentive that she brought us a plate of delicious garlic ribs on the house. We ordered dumplings and the famous wor wonton soup. The soup was a must try (the best) and the crunchy dumplings were delicious too. This was our first time here and definitely not our last."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The girl who works the cash register always goes above and beyond to ensure you're taken care of."}
{"text":"Wow... I've enjoyed quite a number of wor wonton soups over the years, and this rates as one of the best I've ever had. I had a Classic Wor Wonton, king size. All the ingredients were fresh, the wontons some of the biggest and tastiest I've ever had, and the noodles were cooked to a perfect intensity. I literally poured the last elements of the soup into my spoon to finish it off. The base was maybe a bit salty, but it in no way took away from the overall pleasure I had of the dish.

Prices are reasonable, the ambiance relaxed and the interior is newly designed and extremely clean. The menu was concerning at first - I thought the simplicity was indicative of a cheaper take-out place, but I was happily wrong.

I would gladly come back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Will always be our place for wor wonton soup. Modern interior and the option to choose chicken or pork is awesome. Locally owned and operated too. Used to go to the one on Barlow but this one is so much closer to home. Even if you're looking for breakfast they have that too."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to King's through a coworker. We went to the location off of 32nd Ave and was instantly impressed with their wonton soup. Without hesitation, I brought my fianc√© and friend to the Edmonton trail location to share the experience with them. I was pleasantly surprised. With a friendly staff, clean and manicured ambiance, King's restaurant impressed my entire party. The food is well priced for the portion and delicious. I would recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Wor wonton was delightful!!!  The place is super chic and clean.  The prices are reasonable and the staffs are extremely pleasant.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Kings' weekend breakfast is the best. We go there to grab brunch almost every weekend!! 
The staff is amazing - they pretty much knew my name and my order (and my dog's name) after going there like twice! The food is simple, cheap and delicious!! It's a hidden gem, being right in between Diner Deluxe and OEB, but if you skip past it, you're definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"So disappointing, a true review of kings overcooked and cold appetizers I would say they were pre-cooked then re-cooked very greasy. War wonton soup oh my the broth taste like something that came out of a can, 2 wontons and a bunch of spaghetti noodles just rude. Chicken chow main had the worst chicken with little veins and hard chunks & looked raw. Curry chicken again the chicken is just terrible far to much to tofu what really don't belong in the dish flavour was ok....NEVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"It's nice that I live between 2 locations of King's now. Makes it very convenient when I need a quick Wonton fix. I get nostalgic for Western style Chinese food and King's does a solid job. I also like their fast casual concept as it definitely makes for speedy friendly service. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I have to say this restaurant is totally awful. They charge extra high tip fee when you pay, and it's actually self service. The noodle in wonton soup is so bad : (  The soup also tastes like just mixture of water, soy sauce and salt. And their wonton for me is just average. I don't know why it is 5 star, this restaurant is definitely overrated. The only good thing will probably be their environment."}
{"text":"Barlow trail location maybe gone  but war wonton lives on at Edmonton trail dames faces same food. Parking a little tough but worth the hunt."}
{"text":"Finally a Kings open on a Sunday! Was not disappointed the restaurant was impeccably clean and the staff/service was outstanding. 
I came for the Soup and was not disappointed...the Classic Wor Wonton soup was fabulous as always especially with a spoonful of their classic hot sauce. My husband and kids had breakfast which I had to sample. 
The whole wheat banana pancakes were DELISH and the velvety mango smoothie was to die for. Sausage and bacon were not greasy, shrunken up or over cooked like some other breakfast places...cooked to perfection. 
Well done King's On The Hill we will definitely be returning customers!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has 5 stars. People must be very easy to satisfy that are eating here. The food is over priced and our dishes were both swimming in sauce. 
I ordered the vegetables with udon and it was so oily! The sweet and sour chicken with crispy noodles was drenched in sweet and sour sauce. We ordered vegetable spring rolls and there was definitely pork in them. The reviews on yelp made me come here, and I do regret wasting my money on this restaurant. Do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service!  We arrived as a family of five. Staff quickly accommodated our group seating. Menu was varied, plenty of options including rice dishes and noodle dishes in addition to the much recommended soups. We ordered the sampler plate of appetizers, several wanton soups, and ginger chicken. The restaurant and washrooms were very clean. Everyone left full and happy!  We will be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"The bbq pork wonton bowl was the easily most delicious and thoroughly satisfying dish I have enjoyed in recent memory. I added a small spoon of chile oil and it was on! Their menu has many items that sound delicious, and after this meal, I'm sure they are. But I'm sticking with the bbq pork wonton bowl because it's simply outstanding."}
{"text":"had the currey chicken as recommended my friend had the beef chowmain.  the chowmain was decent.  mine was chewy and looked like someone went to the bathroom on my plate after eating lots of mushroom soup.  have they just given up?"}
{"text":"Isn't Sunday the perfect day for going out for breakfast? 
With a mango smoothy and a surprising great breakfast! King's is not a place I would have picked out for breakfast but it was really good. Simple straight forward breakfast menu and the food was really good.  
The price point was good and you got a lot of food. Great value!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I moved to the area about a year ago. When we discovered Kings on the Hill a few months after we moved here, we were disappointed that we didn't try this place sooner ! The best wonton soup we've ever tried! Their udon noodles are delicious too. We come every other day for their $5 specials which is a steal. I usually order the wonton soup and spring rolls. We plan our trying their breakfast menu too, as I've heard their Banana pancakes are the best. Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often and are never disappointed.  Very clean and trendy atmosphere, and extremely friendly service.  Order at the front counter and then go find a seat.

I am pretty loyal to the BBQ pork Wonton vegatable noodle but the classic Wor Wonton is great as well.  The broth is very good, vegetables have always been really fresh, and the hot sauce is top shelf. They have also been introducing new items to the menu in store, which I have tried a coupe of have have been really good, although usually I go for soup when I am there and would recommend the BBQ Pork Wonton as the best on the menu!

Kings has been a great addition to the restaurants in Bridgeland and is quickly becoming one of my favourites.

**I should note that they also serve breakfast but I have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"Yummmm! We just got the appetizer plater (dumplings, spring rolls, and crispy wontons). It was delicious! The service was fast and you can really see the care factor :). Definitely going back to try their breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"Modern decor with great light pouring into the restaurant. We wanted to go to OEB but a 2 hr wait made this no wait look like a great alternative! The eggs, toast and sausage were excellent! The hash was very good but a little cold and the coffee just wasn't the best. I'd highly recommend coming here, minimal menu but perfectly done with great presentation."}
{"text":"Very clean, extremely friendly staff, delicious fresh food! I'm in love and with this place!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows king's has the best wor wonton soup in town, but I went there for brunch and had their big breakfast. It's was just as good as the breakfast places next door but without the wait and cheaper."}
{"text":"Since I moved into the area, King's has been one of my favourites on Edmonton Trail to eat at. You would think, \"It's just wonton soup\", but the flavour of the soup is so alive and colourful it makes me come back for more. The wontons themselves are perfectly cooked and season on the inside, and they have this Chinese chilli oil that's to die for. Hot sauce is important for wonton soup and they got it down. King's also has a wonderful $5 Happy Hour menu from 2pm-5pm daily and there's so much choice to choose from and you really get a lot of quality for $5. They also sell breakfast items which I have yet to try! 

All in all, 5 stars in my books and my new favourite place for wonton soup for the soul."}
{"text":"My fiance, my lil brother, and I recently visited Kings on the Hill for breakfast since we heard a lot of great things on yelp about it.

We all ordered eggs and steak for breakfast. The orders came quickly and their staff were very nice. The toast, eggs, and hash were really good, but for me (I ordered my steak medium rare) my steak was way too chewy and not medium rare at all. It also didn't seemed seasoned at all. My fiance also had the same problem, but my lil brother liked it as he likes his steak well done. Which to me is a crime hahaha!

The atmosphere of the restaurant was great, and they also serve chinese food, which i think i would come back to try. 

Overall, I recommend Kings on the Hill for breakfast, but maybe try a different breakfast other than the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about their Wor Wonton soup! Rediscovered King's at their Edmonton Trail location and I'm glad I did. Great decor, terrific friendly service and that same AMAZING soup. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and cozy. It's a self serve restaurant. You get to order for stay in at thr cashier and they'll bring your food in the table. You get to put all your plates to specific bins after eating. I ordered the BBQ Pork Wonton I think it was and the platter for appetizer. Didn't like the noodle but the soup is delicious. Just didn't like the noodle."}
{"text":"Love it! Best Wor Wonton!!! Their take home for later frozen options a life saver. Server was friendly and accomodating to dietary questions and substitutions. Great lunch experience."}
