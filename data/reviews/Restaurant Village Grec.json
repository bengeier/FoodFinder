{"text":"Went here 3 times and all 3 times I enjoyed it. Very good doner. I usually go to the other village on Jean Talon which is also amazing but I like the decor of this restaurant better. Keep in mind that they're not the same owner."}
{"text":"Le Village grec! Nous y allons depuis des années et plus souvent qu'autrement, nous commandons pour une livraison à la maison. Les souvlakis sont juteux, bien assaisonnés, la salade grecque pleines et les frites maison!!! Et le tout est livré tout chaud."}
{"text":"Best gyro hands down. The meat is moist and juicy. Love that they have a combo deal with 2 gyros, salad, fries and rice and it's budget friendly!   Great place for a quick bite, huge portions and service is quick. They don't offer delivery, however it's worth the trip heading there."}
{"text":"Best pork and lamb gyros in laval!!!!   Great Lunch Special !!! Fast delivery! Service is good sometimes slow if they're busy. Coffee and desert."}
{"text":"Good greek food for a take out/delivery type of place. The lamb/porc pitas are really good. When you call for pick up, be prepared to wait really long, their pick up line isnt well managed, the wait is really long. The food is really good for the price, similar quality to Marathon Souvlaki."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I've seen better. Service was ok, but nothing exceptional. It took almost 1 1/2 hours to get our main dish and it was meat with a salad, and a hamburger with fries... As you can tell it was nothing exceptional that requires super long preparation or long cooking... Not on my favorites list."}
{"text":"Once again during my stay in Montreal we visited another hidden gem.  Not much I can say here other than GREAT food HUGE portions RESONABLE pricing.    Definitely will be visiting thing place when I return to Montreal"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for greek food! Since Miche restaurant closed down few years ago, I have been looking for a good souvlaki place. Finally, I have found it. Everything we ordered was delicious. Greek salad, chicken brochette, chicken pita, fries and rice. They also have free wifi which was a bit surprising. Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"Consistently good.   Village Grec has been contaminating the breath of locals for many years now. Delicious gyro, toxic tzaziki, yummy meat. I don't think you'll be disappointed.   If I have to complain it would be about some of the waitresses. A couple of them have never seen what polite prompt service should look like."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I only ordered their doner and souvlaki pitas. The doner was good but the Montreal location as well as their Souvenir locations were better somehow? The souvlaki pita was good but I've had better and both times the souvlaki pita was a bit on the skinny side. It needs to be stuff with the goods people! They're your bread and butter.  The first visit took over an hour and a half to get our food and to pay. The second visit took almost an hour and that's because I waived down my waiter that I wanted the bill as we ate. Both times are not ideal for work lunch, unless you're the type that enjoys your \"executive\" lunches. Food ordered were pitas, fries and side salads. So I'm unsure why there was such a long wait. You don't exactly have a long preparation to do for most of these items, maybe a bit longer for the souvlaki but both times we waited 30 minutes. There's been other reviews about the service and I'll have to somewhat agree.  Price-tag is reasonable. Decor here is nicer than the other locations. Shame about the bad service.   Edit : Dropping this by 2 stars, waited over 90 minutes for seats. Service is incredibly slow and I found them rude to not inform us on the long wait especially since they give preference to people who take reservations. (I didn't know they took reservations...) I saw at least 4 groups leave as their reservations weren't respected. The wait was unacceptable. When we sat, we ordered our food and I saw tables who ordered after us get their food before us. Terrible, TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"Best saganaki and Calamari in Laval.  Better souvlaki than Marathons. The Gyro is also amazing. Food is consistently good and always fresh. Have been going to Village Grecque for 12 years and it's never disappointed.   VV"}
{"text":"Last night had gyro (donner) platter, fantastic as always. The pork and lamb has amazing flavor. Huge meal as it comes with fries, Greek salad, rice and bread.  Fantastic value and great as always!"}
{"text":"Its worth the wait! Allow yourself plenty time when ordering delivery. The food is great! If you have to drive to get it; do so! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I often order here when I have a craving for Greek food!   Yesterday was no different than any day I crave Greek! I decided to order a gyro doner pita all dressed. The meat, tzatziki , onions and tomatoes just satisfied my cravings ! I also ordered for the next morning lol I ordered the traditional greek salad , rice and calamari plate. Ok so the doner was DELICIOUS! It was stuffed as it should be a standard in any doner pita making place you go to. It was made perfectly! That doner was mouthwatering!!!! I was inlove. As soon as I took that first bite, I was in heaven! Their tzatziki sauce was so god damn DELICIOUS! They really packed that soft doughy pita with flavour.  Their Calamari plate was not any different! They were fluffy and crispy and deep fried to perfection. There was no excess oil , or heavy at all. They were perfectly cooked crispy fresh and delicious. Rice was a little bit on the undercooked side but no biggie.. I didn't come here for the rice.   Place was busy as usual but they handled my order in 10-15 minutes and I was impressed and happy!  Service is always fast and efficient! Overall, I love village grecque. They are really good and i recommend them if you're looking to explore greek fast food flavours.  Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great family restaurant, nice portions. The decor is nice, gives it an old Greek feel. We were 4 people and we each took a different dish m, I took the chicken gyro it was fantastic! But my favourite part of the meal was there salad with special creamy dressing.... Listen if your not a big salad fan this dressing will change EVERYTHING!   I would have scored this higher but the service is long I never waited this long at a restaurant.  We also took calamari, the batter was nice and light and the portion is huge! We also took a Greek cheese pie, I found it a little on the salty side. I'm heading there this weekend again! I'll make sure to take a lot of pictures."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it's fantastic. Portions are huge, meats are tasty, sides are solid and the taramasalata is the best I've had ever (bread based, rather that mayo/potato). Special mention also to their delicious saganaki. Calamari are not great. Salted cod is pretty good most of the time.  The food is on the oily side... especially considering that they oil the pita prior to grilling so it really adds up and makes the sandwiches unnecessarily heavy (but don't get me wrong, it's still delicious)  The restaurant itself is on the cute/tacky style and service is usually good. The major downfall is ventilation. The place has no air conditioning and is ALWAYS super stuffy when busy, no matter what season. So if you think that will be an issue for you, opt for takeout on busy nights."}
{"text":"God Bless this restaurant. It's the only place you can go for a juicy gyro pita, fresh salad rice and fries..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this and the original one for the last 30 years. It's been great up until the last time I went where I got food poisoning from the chicken yero. But the first 100's of times has been excellent. Best hero in town.  But the service is very poor esp. when you get these grumpy french waitresses who god forbid they crack a smile. Its like they are doing you a favour to eat there!!! Anyway even with the food poisoning I will go back but avoid the chicken for a while.  Food 4 Stars Service 1 Star so I gave a 3 star, if it was take out I would have given a 4 or even 5 star. Service always sucked there.   Get a Greek waitress who knows how to speak greek......or at least english as most customers are greek."}
