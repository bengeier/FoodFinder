{"text":"I've ordered delivery once and went to the lunch buffet once.  Service :2/5 For the lunch buffet, they had a large crowd and the kitchen could barely keep up. They also had only one waiter who seated people and handled payments, so it took a while to pay. They are quite understaffed and it shows.  Food: 4/5 For the items available, the lunch buffet was very good. The tandoori chicken was well seasoned and the curries were delicious. Also, the chicken in their chicken tikki masala was not overcooked (unlike kohinoor, sorry to say). They had some mushroom spinach curry that was amazing, and was probably my favorite dish in the buffet (besides the tandoori chicken). Overall the food is quite good here.  Ambiance: 4/5 Nothing much to say here, the place seemed clean and organized. Decor is nice but nothing special, and it's comparable to other Indian restaurants in town.   For the delivery, the food arrived on time and was also very good.   If this restaurant hires more staff to improve their service, this place can easily be 4 stars or higher."}
{"text":"We had their lunch buffet around 11:30 AM on Thursday.  The service was friendly and fairly attentive.  Because it was a buffet, the food was not nearly as spicy as we had hoped. Nonetheless, the buffet had an acceptable variety. The one issue that we encountered was that they would not accept our coupon that we printed from \"Fistfull of Dollars\". Their reasoning was that it was not printed in color, which was not mentioned anywhere on the coupon or website.  Although this was only a $5-7 savings, I was very disappointed that they would pull this at the end of the meal. (We had our coupon on the table the whole time)  All in all, food was not bad... but I will likely stick with Sitara."}
{"text":"The place is decent. Food is average. Service was good. Would visit agian but only when I really want some indian food and too lazy to drive to Chicago."}
{"text":"Updated for dinner - If you don't care for pathetic service and unhygienic handling of food, then everything else is great.  I went there to try out their dinner and the experience was not good. The service was really slow and they hardly check whether customers need something.   Also they need to get trained for handling food, the waitress brought our Dosa and while serving she was not careful and the dosa was touching her dress (yuck). Luckily it was the side and I just removed it and had the rest.   One more thing is like many other restaurants the waiter/waitress clean the tables and they handle food. They just put their fingers in the food as they bring it to serve with which they just cleaned a table (yuck again).  This review is for the lunch buffet  Ambience - Really Nice Food Taste - Most of the dishes were pretty good. Especially all the curries had proper flavors. Price - Very Reasonable Service - Normal  This is my new goto place for Indian food. I don't have to drive all the way to Bloomington for good Indian buffet.  For a long time Champaign had these namesake Indian restaurants which were no good. When Himalyan Chimney opened I was happy that they were able to make some authentic Indian dishes but they do not have a Buffet, the dishes are expensive and their packaging for togo is terrible, but I had to put up with it since I didn't have other option. Atlast we have a really good alternative and I hope they maintain their quality and pricing."}
{"text":"This is a keeper!!! Close to home, decorated nicely, friendly and helpful waitress.  Food was terrific!!! Modestly priced food. Enough to take some home!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this restaurant for the most part.  Some reviewers are complaining about the lunch buffet after dining in at 1:30pm.... I'll come in right around 11am or shortly thereafter, and everything is fresh and tasty.   They have a fairly wide selection of things that I normally wouldn't try, and have been fairly pleased.   I usually start off with my staples such as Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Masala.... all very tasty.   Then I'll go for Saag Paneer and some vegetable pakoras.... again, really good!  The biryanis (goat, chicken or veggie) are ok -- it's basically indian fried rice but I'm more into the curries...   They're naan bread is good.   They have tandoori chicken which is pretty good as well.    They also have salad, mango ice cream, fruit salad and that rice pudding.... they'll also have chutneys and raita and different dips.... obviously you can eat as much as you want, but I usually stop at 1 plate with a salad.   It's a decent lunch at a decent price and I'm fairly happy with it.   The restaurant is clean and spacious!    Something unique to this place are the dosas -- they are Indian crepes with a filling.   I've had the chicken tikka dosa, which is served with chutneys and mulagatawny soup.  I found the meat to be a bit dry but I was just excited to have a dosa!!!   They have about 6 different kinds, so I look forward to trying out the other ones."}
{"text":"Never go here!!! Worst buffet ever.  The buffet was subpar. All items were over by 1:30.  Last night I also tried a la carte for dinner, and everything was super spicy, and sambar was stale."}
{"text":"To start with: this deserves zero stars, but that is unfortunately not an option.   Ordered: Samosa Chaat, Veg dum biryani, garlic naan, kadai chicken, shahi paneer.  The place is very big and can seat lots of people, and in terms of cleanliness it was very nice. I went tonight, and got there around 7. It wasn't very busy, and I ordered one appetizer, one side, and three entrees. We were seated promptly and served water, but it took about 25 mins for someone to take our order. After they took our order, it took about one hour to get the appetizer and the main courses showed about 30 mins later. The entire restaurant was entirely unorganized, the staff had no idea what they were doing and it seemed like they could not handle their take-out orders with dine-in orders. No one came to check on us at any point. We had to ask several times for them to check on our order. The waiter had no idea what we had ordered and did not know what to check for, and when all the food did finally arrive, it was cold and extremely bland. Portion sizes were extremely small. At the time of payment we went up to pay, and the waiter could not even find our receipt and did not give us discount for making us wait almost two hours for our food which was cold and terrible.   Overall, super unorganized restaurant, really small portions, bland food, terrible service. Kohinoor, the only good Indian restaurant in the area is excellent both in terms of service and food."}
{"text":"I often go to Puran in Bloomington and enjoyed seeing some of the same people working at Amaravati in Champaign. This new location came across to me as having a nicer atmosphere. There were some good dishes I don't recall having in the past, and the food seemed less spicy overall that day."}
{"text":"Best service ever both of servers worked really hard specially waitress . The Restaurant was very busy on Sunday but still they managed to handle all the customers and food very delicious"}
{"text":"Decided to try this last weekend, I will start by saying I've only Indian food 3 times now so I'm by no means well versed BUT I do know good tasting food! We started with the Samosa which had the most perfect crunch to the outside. We then ordered the Kadai chicken and Chicken Tikka Kabob with two orders of Garlic naan. The food came out pretty quickly, our waiter was great, he didn't talk much which I personally appreciate and he kept our drinks full. The Chicken Tikka was my favorite between the two, it had a great grilled taste with the perfect amount of spice. The Kadai had a nice creamy flavor, the onions and peppers that were cooked with it were also still a little crunchy which I enjoyed. Will definitely be back to try more! Only complaint would be the portions are a little on the smaller side but I suppose it's a fair trade for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin.  We were a party of four and yet our table had 2 napkins and silverware for one.  The lone waiter was busy setting up other tables (only 4 other tables occupied).  He eventually walked up to us and asked us if we were ready to order before asking us if we wanted something to drink.  Chikoo milkshake - not available.  Khukri beer - not available.  Grey Goose & Cranberry/Sprite - there was no Cranberry or Sprite; as a matter of fact there was no soda.  They have a full bar without a bar tender.  Waiter had trouble understanding how the Grey Goose (not sure we were served Grey Goose) was to be served.  The Punugulu was raw on the inside and really hard on the outside.  The Uthapam wasn't cooked all the way.  The Sambar Vada had way too much Sambar.  The Mysore Masala Dosa was decent.  I got the impression yesterday was the waiter's first day on the job.  The poor fellow didn't have a clue.  We had to get up and go fetch our own water.  To top it all there was a party of 8 women who insisted on sharing their lives with the entire restaurant to the point where it was tough having a conversation at our table.  They are going to have to step up their game if they are to survive."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!  Maybe the best Indian buffet I've had.  Really, really, really, good!  Yes, I gave this place 5-Stars, even though they were a bit slow to provide me a drink, BUT full disclosure, they were half hour from closing and began winding down.  So possibly why they were slow, AND I was the last to leave and they didn't touch the buffet line or make me feel rushed. AGAIN, the food was delicious!!!!!  I will return in my drive back home this afternoon..."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out this new indian place! Didn't go in with any expectations. I'm gonna start off by saying it's great to have another decent sit down restaurant in town. Upon entering we were greeted promptly and asked if we preferred a booth or table since the restaurant was relatively empty. It's a clean place and well lit.  The order came in a reasonable time. My biggest issue was with the serving sizes, second was the spiciness of the food.  While this place isn't ultra high end, it's not cheap either and for the price they really gotta do something about their serving sizes. If I'm ordering a platter for close to $20 I shouldn't end up with a quarter plate the size of my palm. If I'm paying close to $5 for an appetizer soup, I should recieve a little more than a few taster sips.   I went for medium as my level of spiciness which has always been my go to at all indian and thai restaurants and in regular circumstances that feels mild to me cause I love spicy food but this place oh my! It started with the hot and sour soup. Im not sure how seriously they took the word hot cause it was legit one of those things that you can't continue having. It was so spicy that you couldn't even taste anything other than the plain hot pepper, it was almost like one of those pranks where ppl dump pepper in someones food. Upon complaining they took it off the bill. The rest of the food had potential. The chicken especially in the platter was super tender and juicy. The karahi and biryani again, had flavor and had the potential to be delicious but the spiciness overwhelmed the experience. The server seemed to be aware of it cause he ran and got yogurt raita for our table. We also got the bread basket which has a variety of naans. Most of them were good but the garlic naan was a disaster. I guess they never roasted the garlic cause it was so raw and so strong that my gums started itching.  Overall I might give this place another chance in the future and change my rating if it redeems itself but for now I'm gonna stick with the two stars."}
{"text":"Have had many great meals. I especially enjoy the shrimp marsala. The soups are wonderful and the different clay fired breads are always very tasty and complements the meal. The service is great and the staff are always helpful in explaining  the expansive menu. The portions are enough for some extra meals at home and the prices are very reasonable. One of the best restuarants in the Champaign/Urbana community."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the variety of dishes offered at Amaravati. They have both north and South Indian dishes. If you eat meat or prefer to go the plant-based route, there are plenty of tasty options. The portions are generous and the quality is great. If you're looking for a place to go on a special occasion or every just for their lunch buffet, Amaravati is your best option!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. Friendly, helpful staff patiently explained dishes on menu, brought food promptly, refilled glasses without being called, and checked on our needs. Fish and shrimp stews in Amaravarti sauce were excellent. As was the Paneer Dosa appetizer. Roti was good as well. Highly recommend this restaurant and will likely return regularly. Plenty left over to take home. Carry out containers are substantial and won't leak on the way home.  As of this writing, 10-25-17, they were still awaiting their liquor license."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite good. Lots of options and everything is flavorful. Some of the best food Champaign has to offer. Haven't had any issues with the spiciness or the bad service so far. I really like the eggplant or the chickpeas."}
{"text":"I love a few of the Indian restaurants in town, but this is my new favorite. It has the great South Indian dishes that are really missing at some of the other places. We ordered chicken kauai and it was excellent. I also ordered Puri Bhaji, a puffy bread with a vegetarian accompaniment. I had really been missing puri, but didn't know what the Bhaji was. It was EXCELLENT.  Please go. You don't need a reservation. And the service was lovely."}
{"text":"Good food greater lunch buffet! Awesome service too! Accommodate large parties as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love your food. I have been here multiple times and the service is consistently amazing. I am a huge fan of Hakka Chinese food. And I could not believe you have this special cuisine. I absolutely love the Manchurian Gobi which is basically like they made general tso's chicken with cauliflower and it was amazing in a biryani. I also am a huge fan of your dosas and the soup that comes with it. My friend who is from india told me about this place, and suggested a lamb curry that was also very tasty. My boyfriend got a butter chicken that was also very creamy but not too heavy. Sometimes other places can make and it has a weird lumpiness. I like it cuz its a place to take people who are more adventurous and want to try new indian dishes they have never tasted before but also has the more familiar dishes for people who are less initiated."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews my husband and I were hesitate in trying this new restaurant,  but I can assure you we were VERY PLEASED with the service and the food. We will most definitely be back and looking forward in trying their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there for dinner 3 times in the last month and it has been exceptional every single time! The entrees are flavorful and generous. The  Basmati rice is nutty and delicious. The naan is chewy but crispy in spots.  The service is also right on  point. We did not wait for anything but did not feel like he was hovering.  Looking forward to trying the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I had been to the another location of this restaurant and always had great experience. I was excited that it finally opened in Champaign. So, today we decided to have dinner here. We ordered tava fish, shrimp kabab, masala egg and onion kulcha. Service could have been better but since they have newly opened, can't blame them. Tava fish was extremely spicy but good. You can choose either tilapia or salmon. We went with tilapia.  Shrimps were chewy and did not have that tandoori flavor. Egg masala was good, however egg was over boiled. It was spicy and went good with onion kulcha. You get complimentary rice with curry, which was white rice. Overall, food was good and service was fine. There is lots of parking available in this area."}
{"text":"Restaurant Update I usually wait a year before updating my experience at restaurants around town, but Amaravati fell down the ladder quickly. I was so excited that I went to this restaurant 4 times during the grand opening week, however my last 2 experience have been nothing short of terrible. Given how popular the buffet was, they quickly increased the price from 9.99 to I believe 13.99. As you note from my prior pictures, they did not hire any additional staff so it was 2 waiter/waitress covering the entire restaurant. Now this is a delayed review from 3-4 months back so I don't know if they changed anything. Food was running out at the buffet table and no refills for those items for the duration of our meal. When food came out, it was a crazy rush to the line. All and all if they have no hired new staff and you keep jacking up the price, you will find your customers going elsewhere. Also I am not clear if the prior deals are still available like the family briyani."}
