{"text":"Service, local beer and fries made up for mediocre burger. Comfortable atmosphere and was promptly sat at a table. Was at a show at the Convention Center and this place does not pop up for nearby restaurants. Glad I found it because it's very convenient to the Center."}
{"text":"This used to be my absolute favorite place for wings in Cleveland. I told all my friends about their amazing breaded wings. I am not sure why they decided to change up their wings but I am very disappointed. Service is not that great so
I guess I have to find a new spot. Is this what a breakup feels like?"}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you are looking for a quick drink!  Nothing here is quick!  I ordered a patron margarita and bartender brought me something in a martini glass that was the worst thing I have ever tasted.  I should have gotten a clue when he asked if I wanted olives!  I sent it back and asked for a glass of red wine which came with a dirty, lipstick stained glass!  Ugh!  I will probably be back, but only because it's the only option available at this hotel."}
{"text":"Good food but fantastic service.  Kim and Kara Rock! !!
Well above average for a hotel restaurant.  Nothing super exciting in the menu but what they do,  they do well except for the service.  The service is above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Cold in room.  Lunchmeat on my BLT!?  Sent it back.  They can't get roasted turkey breast????!!!  Salmon was OK."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Solid atmosphere.  Pleasantly surprised for a hotel bar.  Marriott seems to come through with their in-hotel dining.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So most major downtown hotels have a place for people to chat, drink, and eat during their stay.  Naturally, our company (in town for a conference) chose Jake's because it was in a hotel right near the conference center.  I fully expected the place to be standard, overpriced, and just bland.  Actually, what I discovered was quite different. 

Situated in the Downtown Key Marriott, Jake's has a great surrounding atmosphere and a great general location in Cleveland.  A few blocks from the Casino, a few blocks from the convention center, the only real trouble is parking - though since it's not NYC or San Fran, the parking isn't insurmountable.  

One night I went for drinks, one night I went for dinner.  Both experiences were terrific.  They have some great Cleveland brews on tap, the Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla was delish, and my bros had a couple of New York Strip steaks that they fancied.  It's pricey, I'll give them that.   But the atmosphere is really cozy, and the staff had that Midwest charm.  

I'm not sure what's up with some of the reviews, because I'd recommend this place to anyone with a suit and a corporate card."}
{"text":"yah i know what you are thinking. hotel bar. how boring. why is he reviewing this. what is wrong with ronald. 

OK yah i know i know. I hit a bunch of bars when in CLE .. and this one was nice. I wasnt sure what beer i wanted so the bartender let me try them all. Super friendly, nice vibe place and if it is in your hotel its even easier to get to your room after a few .. we camped out here for a few hours and it was a blast."}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel for a work conference and Jakes lounge was perfect because it was inside the hotel and I never had to leave the building. We had the BEST waiter serve us. I think he was the manager because he was helping others and also assisting w/ the bartenders. His name was Marcin and he was awesome because I thought out of the hundreds of people that come in here he remembered my name. Maybe I was just special?! JK I noticed he called everyone by name which I thought was great too! We never wanted or had to wait long for anything. The food was awesome and the wine list and prices were very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great, warm place to watch Steelers game in downtown Cleveland. Chili was good, burger was great. Beer recommendation was appreciated, tried some good local beers."}
{"text":"Here for a convention. Cocktails did not turn out well for us. Lemon drop shot was cloudy and tasted like metal. I ordered a tequila on the rocks with triple sec and lime. It came not on the rocks with a lime . We figured it was either the waitress or the bar tender. We approached the bar...this bar tender was not a good listener and does not know that the customer is always right! As a seasoned imbiber I was taken a back by his over talking and his admitting he dropped half the ingredients and used the other half to complete the drink he gave my friend! He states he \"knew it was not right\" This horrific unskilled bartender began over-talking me when clearly there was no ice in my drink and I ordered it on the rocks. How many times did I have to say \"you're  not listening\" We requested a manager and her greeting was \"what's up ?\" We explained the poor bartending issues and she just said \"thank you\" and walked away.  Do not come here this is not a place to be touted when it comes to customer service or cocktailing."}
{"text":"Jake's Lounge is located inside of the Cleveland Marriott Downtown.

It's a bar and lounge. I had dinner in here one evening after a long day working. Ordered the French Onion Soup and followed it up with a Marriott Burger with fries.

The soup was excellent! I was surprised to get such a good FOS in a hotel. It hit all the right notes: onions that were deeply caramelized and falling apart, a hint of saltiness, and the cheese was melted perfectly!

The burger was also good - I ordered it medium. Burger hit the spot and the fries were hot and crispy, without being greasy.

Afterward I had one pint of the \"Burning River Pale Ale\" from local Great Lakes Brewing Co. It was served in a chilled pint glass and was so damn crisp and refreshing that I sucked it right down!

Service was good - although one of the bartenders was a tad on the cranky side. They also insist on charging your credit card before you even order. I'd stop in here again."}
{"text":"Had a great time just relaxing and having a wonderful Cosmo made by the wonderful lady Maritza. She was so nice and gave us excellent service . You could tell she cared about every customer that came in. Had a nice window seat and could enjoy the view."}
{"text":"My fiance' and I stayed at the Marriott and decided we would like to stay within the hotel and grab a bite.  We headed downstairs to Jake's.  

The ambiance is nice and the food was actually pretty good.  I had the NY Strip and my lady had the Fish Tacos.  And some pretty good Hummus.

The downfall was the service.  We waited over 5 minutes with two wait staff walked by and looked at us.  Finally we strolled to the bar and asked if we could get service there.  Props to the manager as he immediately tended to us and got  us our drinks and took our order.  He even comped the Hummus.

We returned the next afternoon and we had a waitress that just seemed rushed.  Got most of our order wrong, from our drinks to our meals.  Needless to say we just ate and left quickly.  When/if we visit Cleveland again, we will definitely stay at the Marriott but will probably pass on eating at Jakes."}
{"text":"Located inside the Downtown Marriott key center location , I stopped here for dinner the other night.
Tried the black bean burger with a side of fruits as per server recommendation. The burger was alright and was more on the dry side.
I wish they have used some seasoning and applied mayo on it. Also tried the Greek yogurt cheesecake which was good.

Overall an average place to grab lunch/dinner if one does not want to venture out of Marriott."}
{"text":"worst food establishment i've ever been to.

just close this down."}
