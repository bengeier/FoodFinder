{"text":"Moonshine is the best thing that has happened to me an my boys. It's my refuge from country music bashers where I can let loose and be myself. Did I mention they have excellent rum and cokes? When that liquid hits my veins, and I got my boots and boys with me, I'm sure to leave a crater the size of Texas on the dance floor. 5/5. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! And here's why...I walked in with my friend visiting in town, a Friday night. Not very busy, in fact there were three bartenders behind the bar when we walked in. We sat at the the bar for several minutes without a hello, how can I help you, NOTHING. Then, a few feet away a couple of guys walked up and one bartender immediately walks over to them and says, \"You guys good?\" Really!!! My friend got up to leave, but I wanted to stay long enough to have words with him. After continuing to be ignored, I finally took the high road and left. So...here's the X-factor: it was a country themed bar, I am an African-American male, and she is Caucasian. I really didn't want to \"go there,\" but after being shunned for several minutes you can't help but put two and two together. So, if you enjoy Mason jars, inattentive servers and possible discrimination, knock yourself out. As for me, there are many other fine establishments in downtown Tempe who appreciate my patronage."}
{"text":"The owner Ryan is a disgrace. He is an alcoholic with a little man complex and punched my friend leaving the bar last Thursday out of no where. He was rude, made gross comments to females and shoved multiple customers inside the bar. While the staff seemed nice, I'm surprised they continue to work for such a disgusting man. He clearly doesn't respect his own business by his appalling behavior. I used to go here all the time, but after what I witnessed from the owner I will never return nor will my friends. Thank God for Whiskey Row."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here weekly! We don't like the \"club\" scene so we come here! The bartenders are friendly and the male ones are pretty attractive ;) You get your drinks quickly and they arent too expensive."}
{"text":"I loved this place! They have great food, mostly bbq style stuff, and they serve late on weekends. I loved the decor and the mason-jar lighting on the ceiling, too. I came in on Friday around 9, and people were starting to roll in. By 11:30, it was so much fun. People were line dancing, riding the bull, outside on the patio, it just has a great vibe to it on weekend nights. So happy there's a country bar on Mill!"}
{"text":"To preface this: My parents owned restaurants and a catering company.  I am also partners in a multi state company that owns several food trucks.  I know the food industry as I have grown up in it and currently run a food truck in the valley.  I was excited to try this place out, and visited the first week it was open.  I got the fried green tomato BLT sliders and a lagunitas IPA which were both on happy hour and were both great.  The following weeks I came back at least once, if not twice and brought friends with as well.  As each week went by, service got noticeably worse.  It started with slow service (even though we came before the party crowd comes).  One night we waited outside for over 15 minutes and when no wait staff came to serve I went to place my order with the bartender.  He said \"I'm not going to bring your food to you I am a bartender not a server, you should have ordered from the server.\"  That pissed me off since I had been waiting for her for over 15 minutes.    Since the happy hour was a good deal and it was normally dead around 8pm when we would go it was worth a little bit of a hassle even though the service was really starting to get annoying.  Keep in mind - during this whole time I was telling people about the good sliders and beer special for happy hour and to check the place out...well not only will that never happen again, but I will never return.    We went around our usual time and this time sat inside so we could get waited on.  The place was dead, and our server had 2 other tables and it took at least 5 minutes to get greeted.  We ordered our usual happy hour beer, which arrived about 10 minutes later.  She just dropped off the beers and didn't even ask if we were ready to order food. After about 10 more minutes we were able to flag her down to order and ordered our usual sliders.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes she returned and asked what we ordered because she mixed our order up.  While in the process of reordering she told us that the food happy hour now ended at 7 (it was about 8), so we canceled our food order (she specifically said food happy hour ended and didn't tell us the beers we ordered were no longer happy hour either).  About 20 minutes later she came to check on us (our beers were long gone and we were pretty angry so we decided to get our tab and leave).  When we got our checks we realized they charged us full price for the beers.  In between this, another server came and asked us to move tables (which we did).  I went to the bar to talk to someone, and the owner happened to be there and asked what the issue was.  I explained that I was upset that we ordered the same thing we order every week and no one informed us that happy hour had changed from 9pm to 7pm.  He told me that it had been changed for three weeks, when I had been in there 13 and 15 days prior and  gotten happy hour prices.  He told me I was wrong.  He said \"we have 7000 people a week, do you expect me to tell everyone?\"  How hard is it for the server to say ohh by the way our happy hour only goes until 7 now, especially if you are ordering happy hour items.  He did not apologize ONE time, told me I was wrong, and was very rude.  He finally told someone to charge us the happy hour price at which point turned his back on me and returned to EATING AND DRINKING at the bar.    It is not hard to A. tell customers about the new happy hour B. place fliers on the table notifying people of the change C. place a sign up on the wall D. update your website.   He said the change was on the happy hour menu...which we didn't get and when he asked the bartender for one the bartender told him they were out.  So NO WHERE was it listed it had changed, and he could not even give me a simple \"sorry.\"  Just the other week I was working and event and a customer spit out the food I cooked and said it was gross....(our top selling item for the record) and I told her to choose something else free of charge which she did and left happy.  THAT is how you treat customers, even when they might annoy you or be angry.  The place has good food and has a cool vibe, but has TERRIBLE service, a RUDE and obviously inexperienced owner and is bound to fail.  I have since told everyone I know not to go and will never recommend this place to anyone. We left and got $6 tacos at Canteen and had amazing service...worthy of a 30% tip and she had 2-3 times the amount of tables.  Handlebar and Mellow Mushroom also crush this place."}
{"text":"I was super excited for a country bar, but this was not what I was expecting.  A group of friends and myself waited for a little bit in a line we got in..it smelled like garbage and was way too hot.  The beer was an okay price and I love country music so one star is worthy I guess.  None of the staff looked or acted remotely happy, and if you weren't awkwardly dancing with someone on the floor, you were standing with your group of friends looking around...also awkwardly.  If you weren't drunk, you just were having an awkward time...so we left an went somewhere else where the environment was more pleasant. BUT...I will probably give it one more try & possibly update my review."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a country bar with a great dance floor, cheap drinks for a fun night with friends?! Stay away from moonshine. Crowded! Country swing is impossible with the crowded dance floor. Since they're open til 3am they get too packed by the end of the night with tools who aren't there to dance or drink, just to sober up and fight. Not a fun place to take a date dancing. As sad as it is to say, you'll have a way better time going to denim and diamonds. However if u wanna see Tempe police break up chick fights and watch people bleed, you might get a kick out of it. Like most places on mill, there's a complete lack of class from the patrons and staff. Bottles are $4 beers are $5. A good shot of bourbon is $6.50+."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Read all the reviews and you'll see that the wait and bartenders seem to ignore every customer they have. Don't support a business that ignores their customers.  I went here 3 times determined to find a good country bar that I didn't have to leave Tempe to enjoy. Each time service got worse. Never greeted once, always served after 15 minutes of waiting, and always had to flag down our waitress to get the check/refills.  I've seen the owner in here and he is a young Scottsdale trust fund baby that just thinks if you throw enough money on your decor and provide \"organic\" kale in your salad you have an awesome spot everyone will have to go to. This arrogant attitude permeates the staff and none of the experience felt anything like \"service.\"  Can't wait for this place to inevitably fail on the backs of their immature and horrible attitude towards customers."}
{"text":"Met my bf of 3 years here.  Was always my favorite country bar hands down.  Had a few friends in town and we wanted to take them here... We literally walked in then out.  It smelled so bad.  Barf & piss was the only way we all could describe it with really sticky floors.   The smell was so bad wasn't even worth it to hang outside.  We wanted to be inside dancing.  So we all left immediately and we were bummed we could not enjoy ourselves where we once met.  Really sad for us and hope it turns around because after this and talking around I've heard just hasn't been the same for a bit now."}
{"text":"Slow service, decent food, and problems with debit cards.  I visited Moonshine after watching it featured on TV and hearing decent reviews from friends. I visited early on a weekend and it was fairly empty. I sat and the bar and was greeted quickly and offered a drink. The idea of serving beer in mason jars is creative, but it's just a different kind of glass.  Being empty, I was expecting quick service when it came to food. College football was on, so I ordered the wings which are on special during football games. It took a good 40 minutes to get my wings and when they arrived they didn't seem fresh. I also ordered the mac and cheese, which was nothing special.  The place really started to get busy around 1:30pm as the ASU game was about to get started. The place became very busy and I seem to have gotten lost in the mix. It took me at least 20 minutes to get another drink after finishing the first.  Despite my better judgement I ordered the deep fried oreos for dessert and was was grossed out by how greasy they were.  When closing out my tab at the bar, I paid with my debit card and left. After moving on to another bar, I was shocked to learn that I had two separate charges from Moonshine on my card. One of the charges was not even mine! It was kind of embarrassing as my card was declined because of the second charge by Moonshine. I called my bank and had to request and advance to cover my bill at the other bar.  I highly doubt I will return to this establishment based upon all that I experience in my first visit. I understand that new places experiencing growing pains as they emerge onto the Mill Ave. scene, but things need to change before I would give this place any higher of a rating."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE ON MILL. Go figure, its owned by the same people that own School of Rock, another known shit hole. Bartenders are horrible, the door staff is irrational and rude, and the fat bald guy who I'm assuming is the head of security was extremely rude and extremely pompous. Would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The Bourbon Burger was incredible. Highly recommend this place if you're hanging out on Mill."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place since it opened. The first time we came in we sat in the second booth from the wall. We really loved the atmosphere, service, and music. So the following week we brought a friend with us. She loved it as well and agreed that food was tasty.  How ever that Saturday May 13, 2013 they started playing top 40's music even though it is a country bar. I asked a waitress if this was normal because we were under the impression that Moonshine was a country bar. She did explain to us that they sometimes play top 40's as well. Even though we don't enjoy that kind of music we stayed and enjoyed our time.   This past weekend, Saturday May 20, 2013 we brought about six of our friends out and we sat in the third booth right off the dance floor. We all had food and ordered drinks. We were enjoying our time and the company we had with us. Until, we were told by the bouncer Mike that we had to move to another table because they just sold the table to someone who wanted to buy it with bottle service. We moved and our guests were a little confused because they didn't understand why we had to not only moved but to a table right next to the booth we were in and it was bigger. I did ask Mike why we were asked to move. and he said that they are selling the table for bottle service. I completely understand trying to make money and selling tables. I ordered another beer and Mike brought it to me and said it was on him. I thanked him.  My guest and I began to have fun again. Only to have Mike once again come over to our table and ask us to move again. At this point my friends and I were really upset. We wondered why they just didn't move us to a table that they weren't going to be selling or just post a sign saying that this table after a certain time will be sold for VIP services. What really bothered my guest was the fact that we were spending money and ordering drinks, buying food and not once were we asked if we would like to buy the table.  After asking for our check I wanted to speak to a manager. So I asked the waitress for the manager. That's when I introduced my self and spoke with Benjamin Levine Manger/Owner. Benjamin gave me his time to hear my concerns which I really appreciated. How ever He did say to me that he would buy my friends and I drinks. I did in fact tell him that we already closed our tab and paid. Also that at this point my friends were very upset and wanted to leave.  Then Benjamin asked if we would be interested in buying the table with bottle service. I said no because we already closed our tab, but if we had been asked in the beginning, that yes we would have been interested. I did inform that I would be writing a review and he asked me to think about it before I did. I truly thought about it and all though I understand that Moonshine is a new bar. My friend who was extremely disappointed. Wrote a review and Benjamin responded to her thinking it was me. Her post and his response are below. Her, Name Melissa F.   At this point I am truly disappointed with Benjamin because I did in fact tell him my name more than once during our conversation. But for a Manager to reply to the wrong costumer saying that he spoke with her when in fact it was me that he spoke with. I felt that I should write a review. I am truly saddened by the disappointing service. I really did have high hope for this bar considering it was new. But unfortunately the bar has proven to be just like every other college bar. So, I wouldn't recommend going here later in the evening unless you want to be kicked out of you seats or forced to pay a VIP service fee. Also if you are country music fan and go to country bars to listen to country music don't expect that here because you will hear other music beside country. I hope that Benjamin Moonshine's Manager/Owner truly thinks about informing there guest that tables after a cretin time will be sold for VIP services in the future. So that he won't disappoint future patrons. I am not sure if my friends and I will be returning considering there are other country bars near by. But if we do I truly hope that by then they have figured out all the kinks so that we are able to just enjoy our night with out it being interrupted."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars! I don't ever write reviews but I went there this past weekend and first of all they ran out of bud light, no big deal but the whiskey lemonade was terrible and customer service was even worse. The manager Ryan was not nice at all. He completely ignored my friends and I when we were just trying to get a better tasting whiskey lemonade. When I asked who the manager was he slapped my hand and told me he was and too back off. Then proceeded to ask the guys behind us in line what they wanted. I immediately left, night ruined."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good place to do some country dancing during the week, I suggest coming to Moonshine on a Wednesday night.  It's not too crowded and they have a good size dance floor, so you can dance the night away without worrying about getting kicked in the face by a fellow two-stepper.   The bartender that helped us (don't recall his name, but early 30's dude) was super cool, not-douchey  or bro'ey, and gave great service. The location is a tad hard to find, as it's kind of tucked away but it's right off of Mill, and there was a good amount of open parking nearby just steps away. I have not been here on a weekend, as I try to avoid the younger (early to mid 20's) crowd, but I heard it can get pretty packed. Overall, I had a very good time here and would love to return."}
{"text":"On weekdays when it's less crowded, Moonshine can be pretty fun. There's a lot of room for dancing and less drunk frat guys. On weekends? Good god, I can't stand it. It becomes this insane college bar, packed so you can't move, with people standing around wasted pretending to have a good time when no one really is at all.  It's not the worst bar in the world, and it's certainly not the best, but there are much better bars on Mill to hang out at, and much better country bars in Phoenix to dance at. Moonshine is really just \"okay.\""}
{"text":"I'm from out of town doing a summer program with ASU. I really enjoyed visiting this bar. Great country vibe and great drinks. The environment seemed like it would be really fun on weekends. I went on a Tuesday, but I want to go back on a weekend. It had plenty of room to dance an a mechanical bull. Defiantly recommend to any person who's a fan of country bars."}
{"text":"Nina is awesome! Lance too! Great food, highly recommend the cowboy burger. Mechanical bull is next."}
{"text":"Do they play country music most of the time? Yes. Do they have a mechanical bull? Yes. Do they have two-step dancing? Yes. But are they a country bar? Not exactly...  Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time. They are also open on the weekend till 3 am.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great music, pretty good sized dance floor. The bottle service is really good as well. I have no idea how to line dance and the waitress patiently taught me how!"}
{"text":"Before I even bust this review out you have to understand that I love country music and I love country bars, even if they are on Mill and most people are there to booze it and don't even care for country music.  With that said, I'm not sure if I should add Moonshine to my shit list (do not attend) or not. I came with a friend from out of town and when getting my ID checked one of the door attendants saw that I still had my pocket knife on my pants (like many country type people). They said that I could check it in with them and obtain it when I left. Since this is a possibility with firearms I figured it was worth doing so I didn't have to go back to the car to drop it off.  Short story made long - when I went back an hour later and asked for my knife and it was not given to me. I was given *a* knife, but it wasn't mine. I told them as such and they just shrugged their shoulders as if it wasn't their problem.  I found it to be very unprofessional. If Moonshine doesn't want \"weapons\" at their establishment then that is fine - either make the check-in official by a manager with a receipt or ask the patron to secure the item offsite. It angers me that they are willy-nilly checking in items. For granted, it is my fault for not getting a receipt but why even have this informal check-in policy?   I wrote the manager about my issue and received no response whatsoever despite giving them multiple methods of contacting me. I would guess that I am not the first one to have this happen to them.  Other than this issue, it seems they never really have any drink specials either. I'll stick to Denim or elsewhere if I want my country fix."}
{"text":"Fun place to dance, have few beers and/or moonshines. I have never seen or tried the food. No comments there.  Moonshine will never be the same without the riding bull. 8 months and still out of service. :("}
{"text":"After reviewing multiple websites (all of which had different times for opening), we arrived at about 3:30 only to find out the websites were wrong and they open at 4. We came back at 4:30 to find a gentleman outside on the phone and 1 other couple in the bar, but no bartender. About 5 min later the man from outside comes in and steps behind the bar. We gave him a living social deal (2 burgers and 2 beers) but he didn't know what to do with it and left the bar again. About 10 min later we were able to order but had no silverware for our meals. Beer from the tap was not very chilled and we often sat for 10-20 min with an empty drink and no help from the bartender who was too busy chatting with his friends or on his phone to pay attention to paying customers. Also saw the bartender give out free shots to friends of supposed \"$50 a shot\" whiskey with no charge. Other staff were sitting around eating and doing nothing and one staff member was busy stocking the bar where we were eating (isn't this something you do before opening your doors?). Burger was average and bun was cold as if just removed from freezer. Will not return for eating or \"happy hour\" which was nonexistent. However later at night the bar filled with country dancers which was fun to watch. If I were ever to go back would wait til later at night as it was a more fun, country bar atmosphere. For \"day\" service, this bar gets 0 stars, but for \"night\" atmosphere would give 2-3 stars, therefore I averaged and am giving 1 star.  All in all typical college bar that appears to be run by juveniles."}
{"text":"Great placurbae for country & current club hits. The coolest feature besides the mechanical bull is the second floor. They have a opening were you can watch everyone dancing on the dance floor."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night because my friends wanted to go (I'm not really into Country music or Country bars) and it was surprisingly fun. Everybody was dancing whether they were good at it or not and it wasn't too overcrowded like some places on Mill can get on weekends. The bartenders (specifically Tyler) were really friendly and were able to make drink suggestions for us."}
{"text":"I was there this Saturday and like most girls who go out to Mill Ave wear sandals, well if you cherish you sandals and your life, don't go to this \"country\" bar. They let you have your drinks on the dance floor which causes spills and what not and you are slipping all over the place while trying to dance, also if you step on just the right mess, you will get a layer of god knows what on the bottom of your shoe that you have to scrub off when you get home. It's sticky and disgusting. You can't swing dance there because there are way too many people dancing. If the owners make it a rule and enforce that people can't take their drinks on to the dance floor, I would most likely be more into going back. Also, the type of crowd that goes are very out of place. When you wear Young and Reckless, SRH and all those brands that belong in more hip hop oriented clubs they will fit in, in a country bar, they look ridiculous and crowd the place for the people who are there to experience a country bar. They need a dress code or something."}
{"text":"RESPONSE TO BENJI: This guy Benji, the owner, is clueless. I write a review detailing exactly what happened  to me and he is flat out calling me a liar. How bout, your a liar Benji the dog, and your bar is a mess and you and your goon squad will be out of business shortly. Adios liar and bad manager."}
{"text":"Great concept, bad execution. This place sucks! Bar Rescue cant save this one. It probably won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"I just grabbed a to-go order, but I was there long enough to realize I'm never coming back or recommending this place to anyone.  Went in on a Monday night, there was probably 7-8 people there. It was dead.  I needed to grab a receipt for my order (my buddy originally ran in to grab the food and forget to grab one), so I went inside and asked the bartender if I could grab a copy. He goes, \"Yeah, sure.\" and continues serving drinks to the people at the bar. I thought to myself, \"Okay, he's just taking care of those people who ordered before me, no problem.\"  As I'm sitting there, watching him pour drinks and chat it up with the girls at the bar for 5 minutes, it became evident that he wasn't taking care of my issue. So I looked around and saw 2 waitresses in the back at the computer. Walked up and told them I was just trying to grab a copy of my receipt if possible, and she replies with a completely unwarranted, snotty tone that they're \"taking care of it...\" -- I was like, \"Whoa, sorry, the bartender didn't tell me anything so I wasn't sure what was up...\".  Queue the 2 girls spending the next 5+ minutes attempting to get me a copy of the receipt on the computer, which didn't even have the correct total on it. She finally prints it up and hands it to me without saying a word, to which I replied, \"thanks, sorry about that.\" And neither of them says a word. WTF? Pretty sure she was a manager too.  To add on, my $6 side of mac-n-cheese was the size of small side at KFC & the food was 'alright' (probably because it was cold after this whole fiasco). I will say, the barbecue sauce was good."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday night with some friends and it was great! Although I don't like country music and prefer EDM and hip hop clubs, this wasn't a bad experience.   What I loved most about it, is that the dance floor is HUGE. It is basically the whole place, which was amazing!   Plus, not only did they have free seating inside, but outside too. They have quite a large patio.  The bathrooms are hard to get to since they're all the way in the back and you've got to swim through the crowd to get there.  So not only did the DJ play country music, but EDM and hip hop too! That was beautiful. :') I wanted to say, \"thank you.\"  The drinks were rather expensive, especially for mill. They weren't that good either. :/  Overall, for dancing this place is great. Not so much for drinking."}
{"text":"This bar was extremely dirty on the outside, they could use a power wash. The place looks like it's out of business and their water fountain has no water in it. The inside was under construction while I was there. I wanted to walk out as soon as I stepped in, but I wanted to try the moonshine. I had a beer and some apple pie moonshine, which was ok, nothing special. Judging by the outside and inside I didn't want to eat here. I can't see how this would be a place to go dancing, it's really small compared to other country bars."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We came here after the Tempe town lake Fourth of July festival, and when walking by we got free shot coupons, cool..... Not so much. Since the bartender poured soda right into the liquor bottle then gave us the \"promo\" shot. Who knows how much alcohol was actually in that.? Ok it was free, but how about the 25 minute wait for a beer!!! And the place wasn't even busy! Oh and they had 3 beers on tap out! Bud light, coors lite and blue moon! Wouldn't recommend, many other country bars in the valley with better service."}
{"text":"I enjoy dancing, and that's the only reason I continue to go to Moonshine. Most staff members and bartenders are extremely rude. I got stopped at the door so the bouncer could continue telling a story to a friend before checking my ID. The alcohol selection is minimal, even their whiskey count is subpar. They will always serve friends first, even if you've been standing there longer. Alas, go to a different dance hall if you want good service and friendly people. This place is only worth the dancing, and even then the floor sucks. I won't be back unless my friends drag me again."}
{"text":"Craziest experience ever in a bar. The door men / bouncers forbid me from leaving through the front door. I was standing there and they refused to let me leave. Told me I had to go through some non-existent back door and threatened violence if I didn't comply. I had to jump the fence on the patio. I literally felt like they would assault me if I tried to leave the bar. Crazy. Do not go here."}
{"text":"We ended up at Moonshine because the next door Tavern on Mill was way too crowded and we wanted to eat and drink before a ASU game, and had a great time! The bar is cool - a nice outdoor patio area with tv's & a bar, and a big inside with a lot of tables, tv's, and open space. The feel is upscale country (fancier than the country bars in my home area of Cave Creek) and relaxed. You can order 32 oz beers and they come in giant mason jars, which is cute. The menu has a good offering of vegetarian items, which is always a plus and harder to find at country style bars. I had the goat cheese & fried tomato sandwich which was yummy and satisfying, and the fries are awesome (crispy beer battered outside, soft inside). On Saturday Game Days they have a great deal on wings (I think it was a pound for $5), but no drink specials."}
{"text":"The place itself is okay but has the RUDEST bouncers I've ever met. Two of my friends were having fun and dancing when one of them tripped and the bouncer waves her boyfriend over and tells him if he doesn't watch his girl he'd kick us out meanwhile there was a DRUNK guy in the booth behind us who FELL out of his seat and not an eyelash was batted. He then yet again called her boyfriend over just to tell him that I didn't know how to do a jello shot. The cherry on top was some guy claiming to be an instructor there offering my sister free dance lesson and after she told him no and looked obviously uncomfortable he just sat next to her and wouldn't leave. I step in and tell him we're not interested and makes a comment how I'm a good girlfriend and I tell him she's my SISTER he then yells \"I'm not even hitting on you\" to which I replied \"I don't care goodbye\" The nerve of some people.   Anyway apologize for the essay but this was our FIRST and LAST time here."}
{"text":"Went to this bar last night and had an overall great time. The guy out front who cards people was very friendly. There was good music playing, the male bartender made me a random drink & it was delicious! I think the drinks are over priced, though. The bar got really crowded. There was a fight but the bouncers were SO quick to stop it, it was impressive!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town, but had a good time here.    There was a decent crowd, the music was fine,  I was able to talk to people without having to yell at them.     Fun college crowd, I would recommend to people who like country music in the area."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a beer, watch people ride the bull and listen to some country music...if that's your thing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. We tried the food and it was not edible. Half the food was already falling apart such as sandwiches. It was soggy and just full of grease. Whatever you do, don't grab food from here, just a drink. You'll thank me later"}
{"text":"I checked out the reviews on here when trying to pick a place for my birthday. I was pretty hesitant, but I found myself in Tempe last night and decided to check it out to see first-hand if it would be birthday-worthy. It was pretty busy compared to some of the other places on Mill on a summer Thursday. The space was just kind of strange - small inside, but a good patio. There were hardcore country dancers on the small dance floor, and I was happy to see it because I got the impression it was just another bar using a gimmick to dress young servers in small clothes (they looked good!) but not really authentically country. Sounds like on the weekend it may change over, but on a weeknight, they were playing country music! Don't think I'll go there for my birthday - I already felt old there as it was - and if I need a country fix, I think I'm more likely to stick to the original - Toby's!"}
{"text":"I'm not a review writer but after reading all of the bad reviews I felt compelled to share my experience. I was pleasantly surprised . We walked in and were immediately greeted  by the bartender Reggie who is all a bartender should be. He explained the bar  and menu in ways that you knew he was proud to work there. He told us his favorites and how he'd order them and he made a great margarita. He was also dead on. I ordered the slider sampler and my favorite was the fried green tomato blt. The food was great, came out quickly, and they had great sweet potato fries which are hard to find and something I love! Service is what makes or breaks an experience for me and Reggie killed it."}
{"text":"Loved the bar for its country concept. The drinks are served in mason jars; they have a large beer collection. I had the cider, but it was mediocre. The prices are higher, as expected of bars, but there are $1 drinks during happy hour.   The best part of this bar was the mechanical bull. Really fun.   Overall, I liked the bar for the atmosphere. If you're into country, you need to go here."}
{"text":"In my option, this is a very good spot for country music. One thing i notice about the bar staff the prices are different ever time. I would clean that up because Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will take them out of business.  The mechanical bull is fun way to bring in business"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday and they were out of beer and only had 2 bartenders with 200 people inside. A place ran like this will be out of business by the end of the week!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Try the fried pickles.   They have the best wings in town.    Bar tender John is the best!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. I was waiting for over 20 minutes, and none of the servers even glanced towards our table. The place was not busy by any means.  Really poor selection of moonshine and too high of prices for it. It's definitely a bar for people who are into the idea of moonshine as novel. Save your money and go to a liquor store and find moonshine for between $10-$25.   The atmosphere is okay."}
{"text":"Good spot. great location. Perfect if you want to set and watch people walk by. Friendly staff and look like a wide range of things to order."}
{"text":"They were giving away free pull pork sandwiches. The sandwich was decent. The happy hour prices were not bad either but food selection was bland. The waitress didn't seem happy. If you are down for a cowboy theme place, then you may want to stop on by. It had picnic tables that you would see at a park or something.  Other than that, there are better places on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bar since the soft opening and I have loved it since the second I stepped foot in it. They hired a new kitchen manager so their food is really good now, the atmosphere is great and most of the people are pretty awesome. I will say however, if you want to get the true spirit of moonshine you cannot go on the weekend. Because, like every successful bar on mill, it is full of drunk college kids being idiots on their days off. Wednesday night is ladies night; it gets pretty busy but its not unmanageable for someone who doesn't like crowds. And pretty much any night of the week you can go there and find someone willing to teach you how to dance. It is not your typical country bar, it does have a little bit of the college feel to it. But really what do you expect, it's still Mill."}
{"text":"Not bad. We went on a Tuesday for a birthday to find some missing coworkers. Paid 40 for 5 shots of rum. No mechanical bull and we were 8 of maybe 20 ppl there. Plus side is that if u actually want room and lighting to practice line dancing this place has it.  It was weird though that there was no bouncer and instead they took your ID at the bar (weird for mill ave anyways) the staff was decent not too big on convoy and even when it only being 20 ppl I did have to wait a while for the bartender to look my way.  I'd come back for sure but not really awed by it"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on Saturday and were unimpressed with just about everything.  The everyone was mostly just standing around, they had no drink menus so we basically were flying blind.  Who doesn't have a drink menu?  It was completely dead on the day before an ASU game so that was telling.  We had half a drink and left.  No reason to return here until they get their act together and actually make patrons feel like they are important and not just decor.  I doubt this place will make it in an extremely competitive environment and once Dierks Bentley's new bar iopens, it should basically wipe this place out."}
{"text":"Just straight up: this place is A-OK. The country concept is definitely not my jam, but I still had a good time. It was pretty packed on a Saturday night and the drinks were on the pricey side. It felt a little dank on the inside, but that might have been due to the sheer amount of people. I definitely would not want to eat here given how dank it felt, but maybe the food is better than the overall nightlife experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a brews cruise. Was pleasantly surprised that the appetizers were clearly house made. We had the pickles, onion rings, and jalapeños . Loved all 3. Fun country bar!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday my friends took my boyfriend and I to Moonshine.  We were having a blast.  Great atmosphere and good service.  While staying there for about an hour, maybe two hours by this time, one of the bouncers/waiters requested that my friends and I move out of the booth we were in and into the next because another group wanted to pay for VIP.  It seemed a little strange to kick us out of the booth we were in and not even ask if we wanted to pay for VIP \"status.\"  We thought \"whatever\" we are still sitting in a booth that fits all of us and we went with the flow.    We were there for maybe another hour or less and before we knew it, we were getting kicked out of the second booth we were in.  AGAIN not asking if we had any intersted to make it a VIP booth to be able to stay sitting there.    Twice in one night we have to be moved.  After the second time, we decided to leave.  I am so disgusted with the fact that just because people want a booth, they pay all sorts of money.  What's crazy is the first booth that was taken, the group only payed $75 and then the next group said they payed $300.  Where is the consistency first off and where are the signs to say that after a certain time in the evening that the booths go up for \"sale\" just to be VIP.  I am so frustrated because finally there was a good country bar in the heart of Mill Ave. and now I feel like I was just completely pushed away from incensitive employees.  I am really unhappy with this place.  If you decide to go there, you better have money with you to save your VIP booth.  REDICULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Warning: this review is probably going to be a little biased just due to the fact that I personally can't stand country music.   I  am sure Moonshine is a great place to hang out if you're into Country Music and girls with their blouses cut really low to match their shorts that might as well be non-existant. Not my personal idea of fun. Plus it is really crowded after 11 PM.  I can see that business is pretty decent for Moonshine as it seems to keep up pretty well with the amount of attendees are the rest of the Mill bars. The thing is that it is a Mill bar. Which means drunk, loud, college kids. I know that. That's why I typically tend to avoid Mill Avenue. However, sometimes I will make sacrifices for friends and head on over to the, in my opinion, worst bar row in the state. Don't get me wrong. Some places are pretty decent on Mill Ave, but the clientele pushes me in the opposite direction.  Anyway, Moonshine has loud music, bull-riding, and girls in skimpy outfits serving drinks that are a little too overpriced. My experience here was not enough to justify coming back without reasonable cause."}
{"text":"New moonshine is amazing! This place was so fun to go to and I'm impressed with what their new staff and sevice"}
{"text":"Make sure to check your account the next day! My bill with tip was $70 and I checked it the next day and they ran my card for $80. Bartenders trying to get extra tips by taking advantage of the intoxicated I guess. It was fun while we were there. IF we go back we will be bringing cash, not card."}
{"text":"I would not go back here....EVER! The woman working the door accused my ID of being fake. She asked for a second form of ID. I pulled what I thought was my credit card out of my wallet, however, the bartender at the previous bar gave me the wrong card! Obviously, this did not help my case. I showed her two more credit cards with matching names and asked if I could go back to the previous bar, get my credit card from the bartender, and come back. She said no and threatened to call the police! I told her that was fine with me (I had nothing to hide). Instead, she called her manager over to look at my ID. He sided with her and told me that even if I came back with my credit card, I could not come in because \"you called my employee a B*#$@.\" I was SO taken aback, because I was not intoxicated and would remember if I called her that name, which I absolutely DID NOT. My friends and I left and went to a different bar. I understand this establishment probably deals with fakes very frequently, but I was extremely disappointed that they were so rude; it was uncalled for. Do not plan any parties here, because you aren't guaranteed that everyone will get in."}
{"text":"This place has the best dancing for country music around! The people that work here are soo nice and it's always a good time. The level of skill ranges from beginner to experienced. I have seen more experienced people here then any other country bar around Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends during our night on Mill after an ASU football game. The first awesome point to make about this establishment is that it's open til 3 am while most other bars close at 2. We ventured over from El Hefe and still got to party for another hour while a ton of people went home. The other thing that was awesome? The line to get in moved VERY quickly compared to other places on Mill (El Hefe, Gringo, Cue). From what one of my friends told me, the music choice is country until around 1-2 when they start playing the top 40 hits. Definitely a great place to go on a Friday/Saturday night esp after an ASU game!"}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere. A second home for some of us. The bartenders pay attention and care, they voice our wants and needs. Mainly come here to dance but will come here to just get away thanks to some of the staff. Thanks to the chef on Sunday's for cooking with love!"}
{"text":"No wonder why this place has bad reviews. We only went because of the mechanical bull but it was broken. Then I get my drink and when I start to sip on it I see there is a fly so when I try to go take it back the bartender claims that it must have somehow gotten in my drink inbetween the 30 seconds (10 ft walk) from obtaining my drink and refused to remake the drink. I had even given a decent tip. Ugh what a disappointment... I will never go back."}
{"text":"I cannot really provide an accurate picture of the bar because it was Friday night, around 5pm and it was just me and one dude inside. There was a table of people outside, but not much happening where I was. I heard from friends that later in the evening it does get busy, but I guess happy hour isn't something promoted. The bar was large and had plenty of room for a crowd, and there was a mechanical bull available.   The bartender was very nice. She gave me a sample of Moonshine Brew and it was very good - but I had never drank moonshine and I wanted to try that. They had a few different flavors, but the house blend was $4. All drinks are served in a mason jar. Nice touch. It is definitely a slow, sipping drink, but I liked the experience. I decided to order from the menu and went with the BLT. Excellent choice! The bread was just regular wheat bread cut diagonally like a house sandwich - and the lettuce was iceberg. Those were just okay for me - but the bacon was thick-cut bacon (excellent), the mayo was spicy mayo, and the tomato was a friend green tomato. It was served with a side of macaroni salad that was good - not too sweet or mayonnaisey, but very good.   I didn't mind the lack of crowd because, to be honest, I wouldn't talk to them anyway. The bartender was attentative, the drink was good, and the sandwich was excellent. I am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker, and while there were only a few beers on tap, it was a good variety. I will probably stop in again for the sandwich for sure, and probably a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Any bar that allows a country dancer to prominently display his confederate flag on the dance floor earns this rating.  Congrats."}
{"text":"Cool space. Mediocre service. Leaving a lot of money ok the table. 15% filled late on a Fri night. Several bar seating areas empty. Nice patio. Good TVs behind the main bar. Main bartender (Rico) is friendly but SLOW and needs another job."}
{"text":"Was in Tempe visiting my ex-fiancé and wanted to hit a country bar that had cheap drafts, strong mixers, and of course, soul shaking two step. Moonshine was recommended to me by my urologist, and I figured he'd have great taste so we tried it out. The second we walked in got hit with this killer vibe. $4 tall boys had me moving to the bar faster than an acorn rolling down a hen house! After my second 16oz-light-beer-you-call-it, Toni (look for the guy with south Texas beard) poured me a drink called a \"sucker punch.\" Woke up mid double hip with a cutie I'd seen earlier at the upstairs dance floor. Not sure if it was the mixer, the music, or my mustache, but one M is for sure, and that's Moonshine. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My sister and husband reserved a table for my birthday on a Saturday and it was perfect. The bottle service was very reasonable and the server, Nina, was attentive, friendly, and she made sure we had full drinks all night! We got there at 930 and it was pretty empty except for some experienced dancers, which we had fun watching and joining in. By 1030 more people came and the place turned into more of a dance party. When we left at 130 there was still a line out the door! My one tiny complaint is that the girl controlling the bull was not very good. Every time one of us got on she just spun it around over and over, no bucking at all. Overall we loved this place and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Country music unless it's performed by punk rock icons from the 90s, Lou Reed, or Johnny Cash. That's okay though, because I'm old enough that I can tolerate things I don't like a lot better than when I was younger. What I'm saying is that I can get past the music playing on the speakers... especially since it isn't loud enough to split my ear drums. Besides, it didn't seem to be overwhelmingly Country - no one was wearing a cowboy hat and there wasn't hay all over the floor.   Having lived in the Valley my whole life, I'm pretty familiar with this place. It used to be a music venue and I've seen quite a few shows here. And that's all I ever did back then. It was never a place to go unless there was a band playing. It's a bit of a hidden location that you don't always think about when you're hanging around Mill. That's a shame too, because it's a great space. It's large and well laid out. It's decorated cool, and their signage is neat looking. There's also a great big patio with heaters and a nice social bar.   I went in during the day mid-week just after they technically opened, and it looked like they were doing a deep clean. I was able to meet the owner and even got to check out the kitchen. The kitchen, I can happily say, is super clean (thankfully, since I saw it after I ate). The staff seemed pretty nice, and the owner was cool and enthusiastic (which is a good sign).   I wasn't there for a drink, but I did get to try some quesadillas (not on the menu yet) - steak and chicken. Both were excellent to the point that I would go out of my way to come back and eat them again. The food here is pretty high-end for the prices, and the owner tells me they are going to start delivering it around the area. Gotta love when a bar and grill delivers food.   I mean, sometimes bar food is cheap and crap and it's just there to soak up alcohol, but other places the food is a loss-leader to get you in the door to order drinks - two of my favorite places to eat are bars. This is one of those places - the food is pretty great, and bonus to the neighborhood that they will deliver. I hope this place sticks around. It seems like a cool place to chill and drink with friends. I'm sure late-night weekends this place is packed."}
{"text":"This owner Benji?? I mean I don't think you could possibly be a more inept, or  worse business man.  Just look at his replies to people on yelp, I mean this guy is so clueless bar rescue couldn't save this guy.  Food is 3/10 whatever so is the majority of the food on mill.  The staff may actually be the most clueless staff around , if you want a place to sit around and talk to each other then rent a condo for $800 a month stock the fridge with coors and go there (you guys can talk about how cool you were when you worked at that one place!!).  Why bother going to work?  Another waste of 200k on a mill avenue bar.  It's not a question of If, It's a question of when this place will go out of business.  The Mason Jars are a nice touch tho 1 star for that!!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this new bar on mill! It's nice that they did something different and decided to renovate this bar to a country bar. Atmosphere is very energetic and fun. Wether your out for a night out with your friends or wanting to dance your butt off this place will deliver. PLUS THEY HAVE A MECHANIC BULL!!! The best part of the bar was a particular bartender who was above the ordinary. Didn't have to wait at all for her to notice we needed a drink or to make them. Heather was attentive and absolutely amazing! This place will definitely  be seeing me back."}
{"text":"The music, and only the music, saved this bar from a one star rating. A country bar shouldn't be trendy, it shouldn't have a 15 minute line out the front, it shouldn't be easy to spot idiots in RVCA gear, and it DAMN sure shouldn't cost more than $10 for a Jim Beam on the rocks.   This place sucks. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We started a birthday evening here on Friday night, around 9pm.   Minor observations: It was dead except for 7 or 8 people at the bar, and it remained dead until we left at 10:30. That's kind of sad for a Mill Avenue bar - we went to Rula Bula across the street and it was packed wall to wall, so it ain't just the time. We were looking for a party and had to go elsewhere... perhaps this will get better with time.   The music kept cutting in and out the whole time. Seriously, fix your sound system.  Security looked absolutely ridiculous; very stern stocky bouncer types, with an air of stern regulation of a wild party... regulating an empty bar. Not really a gripe, but it did make me snort at how silly it looked.  Most of the staff was not smiling at all. They did not look happy to be working. However, the guy running the bull for us was pleasant and it was fun to watch him lull people into a false sense of \"I got this!\" and then throw them off. He seemd to be enjoying his job at least.   Major gripe: The waitress. I don't know her name, but her ass was hanging out of her shorts and she was ditzier than Paris Hilton.  We were the only table and waited 15 minutes for any attention.   The waitress finally pranced over with menus, pushed us to get food like she was Vanna White and the menu a Wheel of Fortune puzzle, and then seemed very miffed when we declined.  One of the guys asked if they had any ciders on tap, and she went \"Ummm, I really don't know *giggle*\".  \"Well, what do you have that's a lighter beer?\"  \"Ummm... Coors and Bud?\"   *facepalm*   They did have Angry Orchard, which is kind of OBVIOUSLY a cider and a very memorable name... how do you not know what beer is in the giant apple tap? How do you work in a bar and not know what beer you have in general?!  Birthday boy wanted to go on the mechanical bull, and we had to ask Little Miss Prancy Pants to get the bull operator multiple times... she kept \"forgetting\"... yes, because one table is a LOT to keep up with.  Then, to really add the cherry on top, she ignored me completely. I am not exaggerating at all, she went around the table and literally skipped over me... Luckily I didn't want a drink anyway, but to SKIP someone at the table is just unacceptable.  Auto-reply to the owner who seems to respond to all negative reviews: I didn't seek a manager out because I didn't want to be the complainer at the birthday party, nor did I want to spend the rest of our time there being given the stink eye by Prancy Pants. Yelp reviews are the best way to get attention these days, so that's what I do when a place sucks, and I will update my review if/when I have a better experience."}
{"text":"I Like this bar for dancing. The floor is rarely cleaned these days and getting a little sticky- but it is open at 6:00 PM every day, and empty until around 8.  The staff is friendly ( even the new ones) and will accommodate whatever music we want to listen to when it is quiet.  They have even let us in early while they are setting up to dance around the floor (Which never has tables on it anyway) We have taken several friends here to help teach them dancing.  I like that I can go pick up some food from a place around the corner or have it delivered to eat there and the staff has no issues with that at all.  Typically I just stick to drinking beer and cider when I am there, and have not had any issues.  I usually don't stay here past 9:00 PM or so, so I am not sure really how crowded it gets. There used to be a crowd of awesome dancers ( and people in general) that would go here 4-5 nights a week for practicing.   They also did lessons on Wednesdays for people who wanted to learn to dance.   This place is definitely worth checking out if you are a dancer, or even want to learn country dancing.     All in all for what we like it for, the only thing that would be better is them actually mopping the floor everyday like they used to."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I loved this place until tonight. No one was at the door so the ladies went to the restroom and a employee, security/ claimed manager, came violently up to me saying this is for paying customers only and that we had to leave and that they had the right to refuse service to anyone...  Haven't felt so disrespected in a restaurant/bar in my life. Been in the industry for 9 years too! :( sad"}
{"text":"Not impressed! I like what they have done with the place, but the service is awful. There was all of maybe 10 people in the whole place and the bartender was too busy talking with the bar back to help anyone. We had to flag him down every time we needed something and it still took forever. As for the beer, the happy hour prices were decent but you only have 3 beers to choose from. Then they go up in price significantly. Then the food, mediocre at best. I would say if you need a late night hangout this would work, but I have no plans on returning."}
{"text":"3 stars purely for the fact that I was offered a free beer as consolation to the worst French Fries I've experienced to date.  The bartender was apologetic and said he could not refund us cause we closed out our tab, but offered a free beer as consolation.  Based on this, I would never ever order food here again.  To stay positive, the $4 32oz domestic beer specials were nice."}
{"text":"Terrible food, most of food is cold when handed out, even if you get it re-heated or even heated for the first time, don't always get all your food, over priced, even happy hour prices are expensive. I thought even after the first time it would be better, that thought was wrong, it was way worse. Slow service. Sticky floors, broken bathroom stalls men and women used."}
{"text":"I have given this place a try on more than one occasion. I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend. This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar. If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place."}
{"text":"2 stars because of the atmosphere during the afternoon was similar to a nasty frat; our waitress was maken' out with her bf in plain site, loud college guys were drunk, smoking, spitting -overall gross behavior, but the food was great! Ordering take out next time!"}
{"text":"**update: After the gm did not call back, and would not speak to me at the bar, I went to great lengths to find the owner. I was given his contact information by the marketing director, Tyler(really nice guy), I contacted the owner. The second I asked if we could discuss the reasoning I was not allowed in the bar, he said he had to go so he could use his GPS and would call me back in ten minutes. Understandable, we've all been there. Still haven't heard back... More than 24 hours later. Oh well, didn't go there that much anymore anyways. Just really wanted to know why I wasn't allowed there. Thankfully whiskey row opens up soon.   Tonight I go with a friend before it is even \"club\" hours. Check in with security at the front, say hi to all the staff I know, and literally bro hug one of the best security guards they have. We order beers and food, and then another security guard comes up and tells us we have to leave because I have be \"86ed\". The security guard was surprised, the one that bro hugged me was surprised, and I was flabbergasted and embarrassed.   This security guard was nice enough to let me finish my beer, but even when I told him I had food coming he said to come back in 30 min while the GM \"reviewed it\". He was obviously forced to say this, as he is another one of their awesome security guards.   I would love to have my money back that I paid for the food that I was not allowed to receive, but more than that, I would love for the GM to contact me as originally requested. I don't get blackout drunk, and know that I did not do anything to get \"86ed\".    If management is reading this, please feel free to comment or private message me. Thank you."}
