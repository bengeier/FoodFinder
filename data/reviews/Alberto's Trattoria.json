I finally had the chance to venture into Woodbridge, and use my Groupon for Alberto's Trattoria. It's located in a run-down plaza (I should really google map these restaurants in the future) and seems to be connected to the bar next door. 

At 7:30PM on a Friday night, we were the only patrons in the whole restaurant. It seems like we booked the whole place for ourselves! The decor was mostly vintage, there were pictures on the wall of the celebrities that came by, and the lighting was extremely dim. 

The Food: 
Seafood Anti-Pasto - $11.95
We ordered this as an appetizer, and it wasn't very appetizing. It consisted mostly of squid/octopus and lettuce soaking in olive oil. The squid was tough to chew on, and left a sour taste in my mouth. 

Veal Piccata - $18.95
My friend's entree was not much of a looker, but he enjoyed the tenderness of the veal. 

Marsala seafood - $18.95
This was my entree, and I\"m not too sure I have the name spelled right, but it was a heap of spaghetti with mussels on the side and a few pieces of scallop and shrimp. It was not bad at all, but I think I can attempt to make this at home with Ragu. 

The Service:
Pretty good service - there was only one waiter running around making our drinks and taking our order, at the same time running over to the next door bar to serve people there. He was very friendly, and constantly checked up on us.  

I would come here for the drinks next time because they're very reasonably priced:
Amaretto Sour - $4.86
Gin and Tonic - $4.86

I did NOT like that there was a mandatory 15% gratuity charged on our bill. There was only two of us - I think we should tip at our own discretion. This ruined our experience here a bit - Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Hi everyone I went to albertos tonight to watch a leafs game.they have a lot of sports chanels. They also had a deal for wings buy one lbs get one free but only for football games so I was lucky I got one lbs of honey mustard wings full price since the football game didn't start they gave me 10 wings. They weren't the best I've had. I then ordered the deal they had and they only gave me 8 wings in each lbs  and to top it off I seen the owner munching on wings now I wonder what happened to my missing wings 

To summerize 
crappy wings 
Crappy deals
Cheap and fat owner"}
{"text":"New and nicely renovated. Not the same old place it used to be and Tiff L. does not have a clue its not even in Woodbridge and it is not connected to anything! Not a very educated review. Service is awesome, has a friendly atmosphere, food is great, Veal is to die for.  Take it from someone who has been there in the last year not ages ago."}
