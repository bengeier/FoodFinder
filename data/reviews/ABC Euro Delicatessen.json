{"text":"This has been my go-to for Romanian fare ever since we immigrated - 20 years ago, to be exact - and it never disappoints. The salami! The cheese! The spreads! The everything! It's a delicious taste of home, and I'm fairly certain I pay most of their salaries in sheer volume of salam de sibiu purchased around Christmas time. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"My go-to for Romanian goodies, probably also because it is close to my house. 

Everything there in terms of sweets, dairy, pickled stuff (mur?turi), and prepared goods like sarmale, jum?ri etc is fairly good.

You'll find a wide variation of Milka, BUT you will also find the Eugenia, the ROM, and the glucoz?, which is  rare even in Romanian markets in Romania nowadays.

Their stand for pickled vegetables and olives is great, would recommend it.

PLEASE do yourself a favour and try their sweet cheese crepes/pancakes (or just ask for sweet cl?tite)

Their deli section is pretty solid, but I personally prefer the Russian delis for that. It's just a personal preference, but their pastrami and salami is very good. 

The prices are a bit higher, but that's expected from any deli of this kind

Over all I would rate it a 4.5 rather than a 4, but I'd definitely recommend you visit it."}
{"text":"The staff here are usually pretty kind. Only downside is that there is too less staff on duty, and it takes too long for me to check out very little amounts of items. There is usually only 2-3 people on duty, and rarely anybody being the cashier. I would definitely recommend that you try the pretzels though!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. There is daily lunch specials and everything taste delicious.

It's a cute little market with european snacks and beverages, specialty cheese and deli meats. You can even order a whole roasted lamb. I haven't tried it yet, but looking for an occasion.

I've been coming here for over a year trying out all their dishes. I have a thing for spinach pie and this has to be my personal favourite. It's a large, cheezy, spinach package of heaven. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"I LOVE ABC particularly for their romanian in house prepared dishes. Their eggplant dip, sarmale, ciorbe, including the tripe one, jumari, pickled green tomatoes,cabbage, cucumbers, cheese placinta, refried beans, romanian specific pork goodies as caltabos, leber, toba, etc etc. They also import from Romania and surrounding countries first quality stuff: magiun, green walnuts preserve, canned meat and vegetable , caviar, anchovies, etc, etc.And again : everything is of highest quality and reasonably priced.Soon they will move to a larger, more modern location. I can't wait to see what goodies will they surprise us with!"}
{"text":"This is a European grocery store/deli that serves prepackaged imported foods, processed foods, deli items (bologna, smoked sausages, cheese), schnitzel sandwiches, cabbage rolls, stuffed grape leaves, and desserts/cookies/cakes. If you want chicken schnitzel, they're $2 each, but go early as they had only pork remaining the last time I was there!

There is typically a line-up after work and you have to get a number by the entrance in order to be served. The line-up goes fairly quickly though and there are at least 5 people behind the counter serving people. Generally, the service is good.

It's a good place to get authentic European meats, dishes, and imported packaged foods."}
