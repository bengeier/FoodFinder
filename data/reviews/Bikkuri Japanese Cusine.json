{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  Their salmon sushi pizza is the best I have had, anywhere.  Their Bento boxes are huge. Their teriyaki chicken is the best. Everything is slightly more than your average sushi place ($1-$2) but it is worth it for the quality!  Their service isn't spectacular, but that's every sushi place.  Everyone is friendly and eager to please.  Just make sure you ask to get your bill."}
{"text":"Me and my friends always come here for quick lunch. They serve good food with decent proportions. The vibe is good too.  There was this one time though, our server was a guy, i haven't seen him for so long so i dont know if he's still there or nah. But he doesnt look friendly at all, he frowns and i caught him one time rolling his eyes.   Another serves was an asian woman, these happened during their dead hour, they pretty much dont do anything, like take your order and give you water that's it. I think my friend paid by card and was planning to guve cash as a tip. The server immediately told us about the tip and how it should be included, we answered her right away that we're giving it in cash and she gave us this look. Another was my experience, same server, i paid by card and clearly was grabbing for change from my wallet, she immediately asked if there's anything wrong with their service. LIKE WHAT? You can see me grabbing change and plus you didnt even ask us how we're doing with our meals. Wiw!"}
{"text":"They use to have pretty decent sushi but now the sushi quality has gone to shhhhhh.....it. lol.  I came here one time and they tried to rip me off charging me multiply mods when it should've been one BUT IN THE END THE CHARGED ME FOR THE MESS UP THEY MADE.   BOYCOTTING THIS PLACE.   Quality of salmon is so bad, I don't know what's so good about his place anymore. It actually used to be soooooooooooo much better like 3-4 years ago, I used to be obsessed with this place. I don't know how they survive because it's ALWAYS DEAD. I guess they did renovations hoping that it would make this place better, but it just looks like they shoved really cheap wine in they glass cases they use as d√©cor all over the restaurant.   Honestly, such crappy sushi, there's better places I would rather go to in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this restaurant for a while as I work in the same building. Decided to try it this afternoon (take-out). I enter the restaurant and waited for someone to assist me. Meanwhile, more patrons enter (at least 3 groups). After AT LEAST 15 minutes, they were attended to. Does anyone come back to take my order? NO!! I had to approach the waitress. She was very dismissive, talking quickly and impatiently and hardly audible. I place my order and ask her how long--her response was 10 minutes. I wait for 10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes....when I ask again...she impatiently says another 15-30 minutes!!!! My food finally arrives, and there was NO apology. Probably the WORST customer service experience I've ever had. As for the food? I would have had a better meal at a street meat vendor. Further to this, I was going to write them an email--but the email on their website in INVALID.   Service is a -0 Food is a -0  I would only recommend this place to annoying coworkers."}
{"text":"This restaurant served me the worst sushi I have tasted and seen.  The spicy tuny was entirely liquid, with no recognizable tuna in the mixture of slushy fish and mayo. The rice was overcooked and there were no sesame seeds.  The spicy salmon had almost no spicy sauce, but cost over a dollar more than a regular salmon role to be made \"spicy\".   The server forgot a portion of my order and had to re-order, and we had to call for a server at every stage of our ordering, despite coming in during an off-hour.   On top of that, it was overpriced."}
{"text":"At first this place i though was okay, but then after a couple of times going there, the food was not as great in quality and the price was more expensive. Ive def found much better sushi places around"}
{"text":"Great value and taste!  more Japanese urban seeing,  but great food,  a real variety on the menu. Had the bento box which is always my measure. Superior."}
{"text":"I found Bikkuri on Yelp as I was looking for a sushi fix after the gym.  And when it comes to sushi, I'm fairly discriminating:  Bikkuri did the trick, which is why I am a repeat customer.  Bikkuri is a decently large restaurant with a very modern decor.  There are a number of window-side tables to watch people meander down King Street.  And even though I haven't been there in the summer, there appears to be patio seating. The service is prompt and friendly while the ambiance is set for socializing.  The menu was extensive and Bikkuri had all the standard mainstays of a Japanese restaurant.  The sushi itself was fresh and there was variety, although the portions weren't particularly generous.   The prices on the other hand were a good deal, especially on their sashimi and sushi combos.    As you can tell, I'm a happy customer.  If you are looking for good quality sushi at an even better price, look no further than Bikkuri.  They are far better than their competition in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Toronto Sushi places and this one is by far the worst - the only thing it has going for it is location and decor (which is quite nice).  Service was subpar and the maki rolls just plain sucked - do yourself a favour and avoid going here and wasting time and money, it's not the cheapest sushi place to have a bad experience at.."}
{"text":"My husband and I were the only ones in here on a Sunday night. So that was kind of odd and we didn't have high expectations. We did see a few people pick up carry out though.  The miso soup and salad dressing were the best I've had outside of the west coast. Specialty sushi rolls were also good (had the soft shell crab and the dragon maki), along with the 4 piece sashimi.  The tuna roll was okay.   Overall a very good dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent service, ambiance, and food presentation. Overall quality of the food is average. Price is reasonable, and location is convenient. Not sure I would rush back, but it was fine."}
{"text":"Unless you have time to be ignored by wait staff, have your order lost by the kitchen and otherwise be inconvenienced, then this is the place for you!  My party of 3 arrived 10 mins BEFORE the lunch crowd but didn't manage to get our lunch for another 45 mnis and only because we told the waitress who had forgotten about us.  Turns out their computerized system failed....how about using good 'ol pen & paper cuz your only running a food joint not a startup!  When the food eventually arrived there was nothing particularly good about it.  In fact, my tonkatsu tasted as tho it had been sitting around awhile.  What a disappointment especially considering I'm VERY careful about where I spend my money.  It won't be here ever again or any of their affiliated restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a craving for udon noodles and broth when I was feeling sick in Toronto and this place was across the street from my hotel.  Serviceable but no Wagamama :)"}
{"text":"This will be the first 1 star I've ever given. I went to this restaurant expecting it to be mediocre Japanese given the menu and ratings here. When I went I was beyond hungry so I would have eaten sub par anything at this point.   This was by far the worst imitation Japanese food I've ever had. The teriyaki had some kind of ketchup based sauce on it and the meat wouldn't have made it in to Taco Bell. How do you screw up teriyaki sauce?? The ikura was mush and tasteless probably because it was old. There was a giant lump of soggy rice covering most my plate.   I'm too ill to write much more but just be warned, do no waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews!!!?!  We were very tired but decided to go somewhre to find a japanese restaurant. Here comes Bikkury Japanese Cuisine, right across the street from our hotel !!. Bikkury means fright, shock in japanese, Yes, we were the only ones in here on a Sunday night and it was kind of odd. While waiting we realized we were in a financial district - not a popular place to come on weekend.  Great value and taste, the food was above average quality! The miso soup and salad dressing were the best we had in Canada. The sushi itself was fresh and there was variety, All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We went back here a couple of times. Really, not sure why all the negative reviews!!!"}
{"text":"I went here because it was bitterly cold and I wad staying at the King Eddy which is literally across the street. So I can't comment on parking or anything or location. However, the food was good. Apparently sushi was the way to go as my colleagues found while I had curry chicken which was only salvaged when I added a bit of soy sauce to it to merry the flavours. The price was reasonable for the area and the dinner was well digested :-)"}
{"text":"Do you remember those \"Participant\" ribbons that the losers and the simply disinterested would get at grade school field days?  That's what I think about when eating at Bikkuri: Participant.  The place gets a few marks for showing up, and that's it.    I've been eating sushi at Sushi Delight on Danforth lately, and I didn't realize just how good it was until eating a Bikkuri today.  Bukkuri's Tempora was greasy, soggy and made with skinny little shrimp.  Sushi was just okay.  Salad was kind of old looking and soggy.  The place was expensive and service was unimpressive.  Thanks for playing, Bikkuri.  Grab your Participant ribbon and head home."}
{"text":"I am so unimpressed by this place.  Sure the atmosphere is nice.  the location excellent really.  Sushi is a rareity in the financial district so I think people are willing to go down a notch in quality and up a notch in price.  Which is a combination I detest.  My spicy tuna roll was dinky, at best.  On the extremely small side with ZERO quality for ingredients or presentation. I was extremely disappointed with this place. Unfortunately I suffered with it during my sushi cravings- until I found out about this little gem a couple blocks north over on adelaide and yonge: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ninki-sushi-toronto  I highly recomment walking up the two blocks to find yourself with 5-10 more dollars in your pocket and the feeling of full, satisfied and not screwed over by overpriced mediocreness."}
{"text":"My friends and I chose this restaurant on a whim just to shield us from the frigid winter weather.  It wasn't packed when we first got there as it was a Thursday evening, but people slowly started to trickle in after us.   I ordered the Katsu Curry. It wasn't anything special and tasted like something I could have made at home. The pork cutlet was also a bit overcooked. My friends were satisfied with their meal, however.   The look and feel of this restaurant is very nice! It's pretty spacious, the decor is nice, and the staff were quite attentive at the time. I'll give it 3 stars for the ambience of the place."}
{"text":"By AYCE standards, definitely exceeded expectations. Service was prompt, and food was surprisingly good. Special rolls were well done, and the menu wasn't missing some of the more costly alternatives unlike some other AYCE sushi I've been to. Will come again."}
{"text":"I met a gf here for dinner. The service was decent. The food portions were pretty small.  The actual restaurant and decor are nice, very clean.  It is a quiet restaurant. We went after work and throughout the night more people were entering but not nearly enough to fill the restaurant. The prices are alright.  Nothing good nothing bad - just average."}
{"text":"I was craving some rolls and was passing by this place on my way home. If my stomach could bitch slap me for my decision, it would've.   The rolls were not good. It was definitely a waste. Where i would usually devour my food in minutes, these rolls took 2 days for me to get down. They felt like they were missing something -- oh yeah, flavour. I'll know that next time my stomach has a craving to not be efficient and to travel out of my way to get sushi I'll love.  Also, it should be mandatory that when handing customers their change in bills, they get the WHOLE bill without 20% of it torn off. That's my comment for the suggestion box."}
{"text":"I got Katsu Don. It tasted pretty good. It's a mix of crispy pork, eggs and onion on top of rice. And I usually blended before start eating.   They also serve good chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki for lunch special and comes with salad and miso soup.   I didn't get to try sushi or sashimi. But I think my friends like hers."}
{"text":"One of the lowest grade sushi joints I've been to, in years.   It has 2 advantages - it's location, and the lack of normal sushi places catering to lunches, as opposed to dinners.   Won't repeat, if I don't have to."}
{"text":"i went here before a concert a couple months ago and the food was absolutely delicious.   I was with a big group of people and my boyfriend and I decided to split one of the sushi boats. I have always wanted to try a boat - not for its improved taste or flavour but merely because I am still five years old and enjoy boats and playing with my food.   The boat came with a huge selection of sushi - tuna, salmon, shrimp, eel, California rolls, veggie rolls - all beautiful placed on a giant wooden boat and set in front of me while I smiled with glee! The sushi was delicious - the fish was very flavourful and there wasn't too much rice (which is my pet peeve when it comes to sushi). We also split the edamame which was tasty and soy good!   The restaurant itself it very nice, lots of room and like most sushi restaurants, you can see the chefs making the sushi from your table. The only downside to my experience at Bikkuri was the service. The waiter rarely came to refill our tea or ask how our meal was. However, the food was so good that it definitely didn't damper my experience.   If you're in the King East area, this is a great place to get some sushi!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant a couple of times for lunch and the food was just okay -- not terrible, but not terribly exciting either. A safe (and perhaps somewhat boring) choice if I am in the neighbourhood and want some easy food. Having recently walked by the restaurant and discovered that it was given a facelift, I decided to give it another shot. From outside, the new look of the restaurant seems to strive for a modern feel. As soon as I walked inside, I was promptly greeted by the waitstaff who appeared smiley and warm. As soon as I saw the menu, however, I realized that it was the same menu from before; although the selections were relatively abundant, nothing stood out as a must-have either. I ended up ordering a sushi dinner special -- about $16 and included some watery salad, a bowl of mediocre miso soup, and a dozen pieces of sushi. I can't quite tell whether the tuna that's on my tuna maki was fresh or not since my palate was completely overwhelmed by the large sum of wasabi that was placed between the fish and rice. Thankfully my whole dinning experience was single-handedly salvaged by my lovely dinner companion, but chances are I won't be back to Bikkuri any time soon."}
{"text":"Very stylish decor! I really like the backlit lights, walls, and the huge glass wall full of wine bottles. The food is above average quality. I had the dinner special with salmon, salmon sushi and chicken karage. Everything was cooked and prepared very well except for the chicken karage - it tasted slightly stale to me. The fried ice cream that I had for dessert was really good! Staff were also very friendly and accommodating. I'm looking forward to coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Went these cause it was the nearest Japanese option from where we parked. Very good interiors, very modern and chic. There weren't a lot of diners though. Just our table of 3 and 2 other tables. Very decent Japanese resto for downtown. Very good menu option. Tempura was okay."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!! The restaurant looks very clean and stylish.also the servers are friendly and polite!  \"Lunch special\" are so good price!! I had salmon teriyaki lunch special. It was a small bento box,only $11 which comes with a small green salad and miso soup and rice. The salad's dressing is amassing! I love it!!! If you like creamy dressing, you must try it!  I like lunch special, but I think dinner time is much better than lunch time. cuz dinner time is kind of quiet and  They give pretty good service!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre experience; we ordered sashimi dinner ($23.99) and unagi don ($17.99) and it just cannot compare to the other Toronto institutions re: value and quality. Apparently the curries and katsus are stand-outs? If I ever return, I'll make a note to give those dishes a try. Otherwise, I'll stick to the safe bets: Saku/Japango/Jabistro/even Sushi Shop, etc"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a regular, run of the mill sushi place in the King/Yonge area, this is a good bet.  I found the service to be friendly and quick and the prices to be fair.  The sushi itself was actually quite good, just not on the same level as a high end sushi joint like Ki or Nami, but priced accordingly.  Rice = 7/10 Fish = 8/10 Presentation = 8/10  Not a bad choice for a quick dinner in the area.  They also seem to have a lot of space and pretty decent decor.  Tatami rooms are available for large groups, which I guess is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This is the closest, most affordable sushi option when I worked downtown right at King & Yonge. That's not to say it's affordable... but for quick dine-in sushi around here, this is the best I've found.  The coolest things about this place are:  1. Since not many people seem to know about it, you can ALWAYS book the Tatami rooms. They are great at accomodating groups here (I mean groups of 6-10ish, not GROUP groups).  2. They are open until 11 p.m.   The sushi isn't the best in the city, and the service can be spotty, but they pay more attention if you're in a Tatami room."}
{"text":"I was hoping I would never run into a place like this but it just has to be said - Bikkuri is by far the worst Sushi joint I've been to in Toronto. The only upside is the location and atmosphere (which is very nicely) and helps really define itself as a TRUE 'tourist trap' (especially being across from the expensive Le Meridien King Edward Hotel).  Maybe it's because we came on a Sunday, maybe we just happened to run into an un-experienced waitress but honestly there was no excuse for the mediocrity from a place that charges this much. Your meal will probably be at cheapest $18-20 and what you get for it are:  - Tiny pieces of sushi with day old rice - Slimy, congealed seaweed salad - Salad dishes that have already been pre-sauced and placed in the fridge for days (making the lettuce mush) - Over-salted Karage - Mediocre teriyaki with a pretty poor excuse of a sauce  Plus it doesn't help when the waitress comes over 5 minutes after you order to ask you to repeat your order. And then forgets to remember what comes with a bento box and gives us the bill without bringing out the rest of the items!  I don't think I've ever been so dissapointed from a place in Toronto before but do yourself a favour and AVOID!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and the food was very disappointing. The chicken teriyaki was cold and when we complained they heated it In the microwave and it came back super tough. We had to send it back. The salmon teriyaki was not good either. It tasted like it was warned up and not freshly cooked. It comes with only a token piece of carrot and broccoli as a garnish."}
{"text":"Solid Japanese, though not as memorable as you'd want it to be. The food is good, including some good specials."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had one of the combo plates and everything was fantastic especially the tempura.   I will definitely be back soon. I also was amazed of the reasonable prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Went at lunch to try their lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki for $8.99. Good customer service and decent food portions. I prefer eating here than going to a food court since its the same price and better environment."}
{"text":"Just ate here while on a business trip in Toronto.  Nice location on King Street.  Easily accessible from lower downtown Yonge St area.  Decor was very \"chic\".  Nice floor to ceiling windows near front of restaurant for street peeping while you dine.  I ordered the spicy sushi, crazy maki, SGW maki, negi toro maki, and unagi maki.  The SGW making came out first.  It was tuna wrapped with salmon (no rice) with a decent size glob of wasabi and a little ginger.  This one will send your tastebuds and nose into a wasabi-frenzy!  I ended up scooping out most of the wasabi as it was a little overkill.... but VERY delicious and fresh.  The negi toro maki was great, but very small.  (Since toro is much more expensive than maguro, I can see why.)  By far, the highlight was the Crazy maki.  I perfect blend of spicy maguro (tuna) and spicy wasabi tobiko and avocado.  Yum!  The spicy tuna sushi (found with the other nigiri sushi on the menu) was a good portion of maguro mized with a spicy mayo.  Could have used a little more heat.  The unagi maki was not my favorite, but decent.  I haven't had sushi in Toronto before, so I have nothing to judge it against.  However, the quality, speedy service, and great prices for a downtown metro area (makis were $5-10).... I definitely give this a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Typical non-japanese run japanese-restaurant.   The standard menu of Sushi, teriyaki, don-buri, tempura.  May be a good place for some who don't know better, but not for the taste-discriminant."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this place was named Kabuki. I like this place for food. They serve my comfort food curry Katsu.  Service however is one thing they really need to work on, the service standard is low no matter when I go. Sunday at 6:00 pm when there are very few patrons or Wednesday at 1:00 when they are busy. My experience today begun like this. I entered the restaurant and waited for about a minute, a server came and I requested a table for one. She looked around and said there are no small tables available but I can seat you by the bar. I walked close to the sushi bar and saw it was used as service table for the moment, I did say I don't want to be near that since it will be really busy area and I have to have a quieter table without distractions, she responded I have the four tops for bigger group. I told her I will wait.  As I was waiting the bartender sat me on one of the four top table.  Anyways another server came by and took my order and I specified that I like the tempura for appetizer and katsu for main and a coke please. She brought the coke and I waited a good 10 min until both my tempura and katsu arrived at the same time, which disappointed me. Food was good, and I have no complaints against the food.  Another issue I have is that there are two hand sanitizer pumps in the restaurant, one by the main door and one by the washrooms, they are always empty and I believe they never refill them. Washrooms are a little messy given on high volume usage but they are fairly clean.  Total cost of today's lunch.  Coke Shrimp tempura Katsu curry  HST ------- $27.11"}
{"text":"The Spider roll was burnt (Crab used in the roll was burnt!). Decent Salmon teriyaki lunch but the miso soup lacked miso!!! They scrimp on the basics like miso or tofu in the miso soup. Will not be visiting them again."}
{"text":"so a few months ago I hosted a party for my club and I ordered some sushi from here. what we thought was going to be big pieces of sushi end up being really tiny ass pieces. not only that it actually cost me almost $135 3 platters with tiny pieces. I recommend never to order from their party menu because you're not getting your money's worth path that out of the piece that you're getting... sure the sushi was good and all but the experience was ridiculous.. next time I'm going to be searching more in my life and then just go in the first place a friend told me that was good.."}
{"text":"Love this place, I am from Vancouver and particular about what I eat. Sushi is fine, I normally have the Bento Box D, which includes a full meal box, chicken, samon or beer teriyaki miso soup and desert.   I make a point to visit here whenever I visit Toronto which is about 4 times a year.  Not sure why all the negative reviews. They recently upgraded the place and the place looks stunning now. Nice quite restaurant, friendly service and a relaxing environment. Normally costs me about $25 for a full meal, sushi and sashimi included.  Recommended, try it, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked in to this Japanese restaurant while hunting for a fresh meal on Sunday afternoon.  The place wasn't that busy, and our waitress was not the most pleasant last. The seaweed salad was good, however the sushi was ok.   Nice ambiance large dining room  Several maki's, sushi, sashimi and appitziers for two: $70 w/tax &tip"}
{"text":"Large spacious japanese restaurant with great interiors. It looks upscale from the outside, but the prices are quite reasonable. Everything is presented very cleanly and minimalistic.  The specials are nicely priced, sushi is average though. Didn't seem like there were many servers present, but we also came at an odd time to grab a bite."}
{"text":"You're on vacation.  You're not suppose to be staying in your hotel.  You are suppose to say out all day and all night doing something 24/7.  Because you are on vacation.  Tell me how that makes SENSE?!  So Joe and I decided we wanted to eat in the comforts of our hotel room and decided on take-out.  Here comes Bikkuri! Right across the street from our beloved hotel.    I decided on the delicious Bento Box C which consisted of:  - Salmon Teriyaki   - 6pc salmon/tuna/California roll  - Assorted veggie tempura and shrimp tempura  - Rice  - Miso Soup  - Ice cream Joe opted for the curry rice with fried pork.  While waiting I took in our surroundings.  Everything was very chic, and it definitely fit in with the financial district vibe.  Everything was in place and it looked like there wasn't a speck of dust anywhere.  When we got back to the hotel room we attacked our food.  Everything was delicious.  The miso soup was some of the best I've had ever.  The salmon teriyaki was a little dry but there was enough sauce to cover it up.  The veggie tempura was HUGE.  I stole a bite of Joe's curry and it was mighty tasty.  The chocolate ice cream was very tasty as well.    Overall I am a big fan of this place and definitely will come in and eat at the restaurant.  Joe and I were so full from stuffing our faces that we watched TV for the rest of the night.  So there!"}
