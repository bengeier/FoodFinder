{"text":"This place was REALLY good!  There aren't too many good Mexican food joints, especially on the west side of town, but this place definitely hit the spot! Their tortas and fried potato tacos were great, but we especially enjoyed the carne asada tacos. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best enchiladas in Vegas!!! Authentic mexican enchiladas for sure!!! The tacos are also very good but enchiladas definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic Mexican food. It was worth the drive to China town to eat at this food truck! Tamales and tacos were on point."}
{"text":"Came across this gem accidentally. These tacos are the best!!!!! And I don't say that lightly I am a taco fanatic when I came here for the first time I didn't expect me to wow me but they did. Only thing I would change is for them to have more locations in Las Vegas maybe closer to Henderson.  Prices beat their competitors!"}
{"text":"I swear by these flavorful tacos, hands down best tacos in Las Vegas. The only taco place that can compete is Los Tacos the rest are overrated especially Tacos el Gordo."}
{"text":"I love there carne asada tacos and alpastor tacos. They are the best for this side of town and there prices are reasonable I believe they have a sale on Wednesday's too. Also good costumer service the lady there already recognizes us she super friendly. It's a nice little restaurant next to a gas station kind of an odd place but big enough has tables and chairs. Recommend the tacos  they also have tortas and burritos"}
{"text":"Opens late 6days a week. Authentic Mexican street food. Try everything on there menu!"}
{"text":"Just had a burrito and it was fantastic! Great, fast service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best tacos I ever had. Most tender meat. Forget Robertos.come here new location on flamingo and El Camino."}
{"text":"Do not let appearances fool you. This is attached to the gas station building with it's own entrance. This was my first visit and I was helped by a mature couple. She took my order and he prepared it. The menu is basic: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas, drinks and this is a GOOD thing. The word \"la carreta\" translates to the wagon so the menu relates to what you might expect of a taco wagon or small taco truck. There is no salsa bar but they included a red and a green sauce with my to-go order and they were both spicy and tasted fresh. I ordered two tacos each of the al pastor and the carne asada. My favorite is the al pastor because it was tender with a little heat plus a hint of sweet from the pineapple. The carne asada tacos were generous, nicely seasoned and chopped in easy small bite size pieces. All of my tacos were priced nicely at $1.50 each. I will definitely come back but I'm torn about ordering the same thing because it was so good or trying the rest of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my spot to hangout on Friday night! I have tried many different tacos' places, but this tacos' truck is my favorite. You can't beat the price for $1.50/taco! Also, employees are friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos were excellent. Definitely \"food truck\" experience though. Either take away or eat in your car. But don't let that keep you away. Very tasty!!! Prices are good. $1.50 per taco. Tortillas are excellent."}
{"text":"I've been looking for these carne asada tacos in Las Vegas for years. Delectable carne asada tacos, seasoned and cooked well doesn't seem like a difficult order, but I'd given up on trying to find them in this town. I've been to many taco spots and they seem to focus on their pork dishes. The street tacos at La Carreta are flavorful and tender and, yes, greasy. They take a few minutes to come out and they are worth it. The tacos are well priced and the service is always professional.  

Thank you to the other Yelpers who found it for me. I'm glad it's quite a ways from me otherwise I'd be stopping by on a regular basis. I enjoyed their consome, but I'm a creature of habit who is not interested in the rest of the menu. Come here for the tacos. These carne asada street tacos are absolutely as good as it gets in this town."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Sometimes I can't find it but the food is fresh the ingredients are fresh and worth the trip. A great late night snack."}
{"text":"The pork tacos are the best ones but all there tacos are good best place for street tacos"}
{"text":"Another place I would give the finger over a single star rating. It honestly sucks to give them one star based on the way they handled a simple situation and made it an lame experience. First of all the tacos had very little meat. I order two tacos de tripas and you could count the pieces of tripas in the tacos. At $2.50 each you had better do better than that! Now here is where I had a problem. My son does not eat spicy food. I made it a point to tell the woman taking orders that I need a bean and cheese burrito with no salsa, just plain beans and cheese. You would think this idiot would tell me that their refried beans are prepared with chile in them! Well, she didn't. My son took a bite and then tells me \"Mom, the beans have chile.\" I took a spoonful of beans and sure enough they have Chile in them. I walked up to her and handed her the burrito letting her know that my son could not eat it because the beans have chile and I would like to have the burrito replaced with a quesadilla, Just the cheese and the tortilla. She takes my burrito and then hands me the quesadilla when it's ready. Here i thought it would be like other small businesses that gladly replace something when the customer is not Happy with what they received.  She then tells me it's $3.50 for the quesadilla. I told her that we will not be paying for the quesadilla since she failed to tell me that the beans had chile and my son doesn't eat chile. She then says \"what fault is it of ours that your sons doesn't eat chile?\" Oh bih, no. Not only did she show how stupid she was by making such a comment regarding a six year old child but she also managed to add to the fire burning within by telling me she threw away the burrito when I gave it to her so that we couldn't take it home with us. The meats were blah, the service was pure shite. Take your money elsewhere where you get a good amount of meat and better customer service. Oh wait, one more thing. Their Jamaica and horchata are kept in funky jars in their fridge and they dilute it with water and then serve it to you 15 minutes after you order it."}
{"text":"Two stars because the staff was really nice, However the lomo tostada got me sick, can't recommend this place"}
{"text":"They know me by name. I'm a authentic taco freak... Look no further. This shit taste like a Tijuana taco stand after one to many tequila shots."}
{"text":"closest thing to socal's taco trucks!

small hole in the wall joint with a few tables...but honestly, it's these places that are usually my fav! Authentic flavors and well priced at a buck fifty per taco!

Definitely check this place out for the best street tacos in Vegas! (other than el gordo)"}
{"text":"these tacos are so dank, i never give 5 stars but damn these tacos are flame.
they give you grilled/fried onions and what everyone needs to do is request for avocados on their tacos it makes it more fire."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall taco truck!  Really good tacos. In my opinion way better than tacos del Gordo"}
{"text":"Really liked the carne asada tacos. a cool little place where everything is atleast abovae average or better which is really nice when you consider the low prices this place has. Not a bid Al Pastor tacos fan but I tied and likes theirs. I will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on Saturday 8/20/16 as I was really craving some authentic Mexican street tacos. I was very impressed with this place. Don't let the location fool you. The tacos here are  delicious, this a very clean and friendly establishment. Prices are so affordable for good quality food. I had their al pastor tacos, the tripas taco and the Asada taco all really good! I am not one to go to just any food stand,  believe me  I will be going back. Just take note they don't really open till 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Not much on atmosphere ,staff was not especially friendly, and the menu didn't offer much choice, but all that we had was really tasty. We had several tacos-al  pastor, carne asada, chorizo and dorado (deep fried potato). We also tried a couple of enchiladas-chicken and bean. The enchiladas were my favorite...and the green salsa was why I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Are you around China Town area??  You HAVE to try this taco truck!! Yup, it's that simple!

They've been around and moved to various locations, but they are back in China Town.  They are located inside the parking lot of KAO auto styling, you simply can't miss it, the taco truck also opens late, it usually stays open after 2am.

I've tried most things on the menu, except for the hamburger and hot dogs.  Why would you go to a taco truck to get a burger?  I've had all the meats they've got to offer, from al pastor, carne asada, lengua (beef tongue) to tripa (stomach).  They are all delicious!  Try one, try all!  Also, their burritos are great, get it with al pastor!

Don't want to wait for your food? call ahead!!!  The staffs are very friendly! =)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find cheap delicious food other than fast food chains late at night. But tucked in the middle of Chinatown LV you will find this quaint taco truck in an auto shop parking lot that offers great Mexican food! Stumbled across this place driving home after a concert at the T-Mobile Arena after midnight!

We ordered Al Pastor and Carne Asada tacos ($1.50/ea) and a Carne Asada quesadilla which came with a side salad ($5.00). For the price that these tacos are going for, I could eat these everyday! Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu! 

There are a few chairs for customers to enjoy their food and a salsa bar is available with various sauces and limes as well. Do not let the facade of this place fool you into thinking that what they serve isn't good!"}
{"text":"TOTALY traditional! !! Just like the tacos from the street vendors in Mexico city.. So good and cheap. I could eat 10 of the  tripa!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in my neighborhood in spring Valley on the west side. Not expensive,quality  very good! I'm problem coming back again with all my friends. It's right next to the gas station so if your getting gas stop by for tacos!"}
{"text":"This taco stand is A-OK.   This stand sits in the same parking lot as Luv-it Frozen Custard and the infamous OG club.

I love their tacos de tripa and I would suggest getting these extra crispy.   The only odd thing is I have seen them come straight out of a frozen bag into the fryer.  The taste is still great, just odd to me as I have never seen it done this way.  This may however be a good thing as they can tend to be a little on the gamey side if not cleaned thoroughly, so coming from a pre-package source may ensure quality.   

Their burritos are also tasty and will cost you $5.50 or an extra $2.00 if choosing lengua or tripa and best of all their tortillas are freshly made.  

Not a bad stop for a quick bite and the service is pleasant most of the time.

{"text":"Delicious, real Mexican tacos! The tacos dorados were excellent!! Great late night taco joint!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best enchiladas I have tried & not just for a fast food place even better than the one's I've tried at Bonito/Lindo Michoacan. Prices are really fair also. Love it"}
{"text":"Tacos La carreta is super yummy!!! The carne sada tacos are always my go to when I'm showing clients around this neighborhood. I love it when my clients are from California because they really enjoy it when I take them here in between houses. Defiantly recommend, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This food truck is a place everyone should stop at! I am so happy my clients told me about Tacos La Carreta. Price is great & fool is amazing. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Would like to know what their food actually tastes like, but stood at the counter for way over 5 minutes and not one of the three employees even looked my way. The place was dead except for one couple who seemed extremely agitated as well."}
{"text":"Tacos in Chinatown?? No way!!!! Well, may be. I went here with couple of my very good friends and fellow yelpers. The tacos are pretty good and the sauces are also flavorful and spicy. I went for their 6 el pastor tacos, 3 the first time, then 3 more later. The meat was juicy and the toppings on the tacos were fresh. 

The only negative thing I can say is that the parking lot is very odd. People are total a-holes when they park their cars behind yours and leave. It took me 5 minutes to get my little car out. So, just be careful when parking."}
{"text":"This place is a pop-up taco shop that is usually at this location every day, though occasionally they might not be there for whatever reason. The street-style tacos are absolutely amazing.  I'm a big fan of the al pastor, but my girlfriend swears by the lengua.  The carne asada and chorizo tacos are also great. What makes these tacos so good is that the meats are very well seasoned or marinated. The toppings are also just right. This place is great for a late night snack after a night on the town, but you also wouldn't be depriving yourself if you had their food for dinner. And the prices are rock bottom."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in las vegas! Hands down!! I grew up in Southern California eating King Taco & these tacos are even better i had the Carne asada tacos with the red salsa they where delicious! Their orchata is tasty as well."}
{"text":"This taco spot was the perfect end to my night! Delicious Tacos.... street food like no other! If you want REAL tacos come to this spot!"}
{"text":"I hail from LA so Mexican food is essential in my diet. This place is perfect. They are always kind and the food is really good. Every time I come to Vegas, we have to stop by at least once. I've tried the carne asada burrito, the carne asada tacos, and chicken burrito. All were perfectly made and very flavorful. There is always parking and the area we eat at is clean and tidy. Food is also very affordable. Definitely a good place to stop at."}
{"text":"Solid taco truck, forsure. This is randomly sitting in the middle of China Town, and due to the large amount of traffic during the day, I have never noticed it, but one late night driving through I spotted it and looked it up on yelp to find great reviews! I tried it myself and had an Al Pastor burrito and my bf had a Carne Asada Burrito and they were both so good and flavorful! Great price, great authentic flavoring taste!"}
{"text":"The place is hard to find! It's a small white taco stand situated within the parking lot of a tire shop. Once you get there you will be greeted by friendly staff working inside the taco stand.
The \"tripas\" tacos were just right, not too crunchy and tasty. They also have birria tacos, burritos, tortas, tostadas and other Mexican fast food. Overall, my experience there was good! They are not the best tacos I've ever had, but I highly recommend you visit this place."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss from the Bay are the taco trucks. Where are the taco trucks in Vegas? I like eating in Chinatown area and I have been driving past this taco trailer until one day I had to stop for a bite and I am glad I did.

It was so good I forgot to take a picture of it. lol. Or I could have been really hungry. I got the carne asada, tripas, and lengua tacos - all tasty and not greasy. Just what I would expect from a quality street taco. 

This spot has been becoming more and more popular and the lines are getting longer. So be prepared for a little bit of a wait to fill your street taco craving."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious!! We have been here a few times now and every time the tacos are delicious! 

Con is the truck is located in a small parking lot so can be difficult to get a spot when they are busy. But it is worth it!! 

Delicious tacos, food served quickly! We got 4 al pastor, 3 Lengua, and 3 tripe - 10 tacos for under $20!! They have a cart of salsas, radishes and limes.. Take as much as you want! Also provide napkins and a few chairs for people to sit and eat. 

Nothing better than stopping by this truck after a long day or work for some quick tacos before heading home!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had, hands down. We lived in San Diego for a while, and I've missed perfect tacos. Here they are, and I'm so psyched this place is nearby. Add the super friendly staff and lightning fast serving, and this might be one of the best joints in Vegas. 

Go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are on the cusp of having lived in Las Vegas for 4 years. We moved here from LA near the 10 and 110. Basically, we know our tacos. 

We've had good tacos in Las Vegas, but none ever compared to the street tacos from a stand or truck somewhere near an LA freeway. 

This all said, I took my husband here for lunch about a month ago after months of insisting it was worthy of his consideration. He's gone back several times since, declaring their tacos the best in Las Vegas. I've been along for a few. 

The carne asada taco is available for $.99/ea on Wednesdays. All of the meats are well prepared. The pastor is sweet and charred. The barbacoa is moist and tender. The chorizo is flavorful and just the right amount of sweet. The asada is beefy and crisp. The lengua is tasty. Carnitas will be added to the \"one of each\" taco order. 

The salsas are literal and figurative FIRE. If you like your nose to run while eating (which I do), load up on the salsas. 

The interior consists of 3 - 4 four-tops, a counter for ordering, one large trash can, and a large flat-screen TV above the salsa bar. The storefront is next to a gas station. It's not a place for a large party sit down. In fact, most guests order the food to go."}
{"text":"Location change! They are now at 
3851 Penwood Ave Las Vegas, NV 89102.
This place is the real deal. Delicious tacos! I like the pastor more than carne asada. The kitchen looks clean and they go to the trouble of setting up tables and chairs, cleaner than many restaurants. Worth finding this little gem."}
{"text":"Great food.  It's a bit tricky to find cause it's basically part of a gas station.  Try the tripas.  The carne asada fries are outs"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite taco spot in Las Vegas. Never lets me down for a late night snack. Their meat for their tacos is a mouthful of flavor and you could tell how authentic their meat is. I would highly recommend this place if you guys are looking for street tacos. PEACE!"}
{"text":"Other then Tacos el Gordo... This spot has some solid tacos! Had the barbacoa and the flavor was bangin'... Only thing I got against the place is the size of the quesadilla... For $7 it was kinda small.. Other then that solid tacos!"}
{"text":"I was informed by another Yelper that this Food Truck is still around so updating my review."}
{"text":"Was craving some street tacos and found this place on Yelp. What sold us versus all the other places ? The price!! Only $1.50.

They were really good and they were stingy with the meat like some places. 

Got the order correct as well with no onions. 
Will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I had noticed this new trailer while driving along Spring Mountain (yeah, it's BRIGHT), and had to try them out when I heard they served potato tacos. I know that these are common amongst L.A. vendors, but I don't know too many places in Vegas that serve them. My order of two tacos dorados comprised crisp fried corn tortillas with a simple filling of potato mashed with a little onion, topped with shredded cabbage and queso fresco. Adding some of the red tomato salsa that was served with the tacos made for the perfect snack, and it only cost $1.50 for both tacos! Service was very friendly, and I was impressed by how clean the trailer looked. This is also the first taco truck that has handed me a business card with their information, just to add another touch of professionalism."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos at this place were really good I went with a friend to check out this taco truck and even tho they have minimal parking the tacos are worth it! We ordered al pastor, carne asada, and chicken. In my opinion next time I'd pass on the chicken tacos and order more carne asada and al pastor. The food truck is parked in front of Kao auto store. It has very limited parking so if you cant find a spot, there the Chinese plaza across the street or other business parking around it. Overall a great place to get some nice street tacos!"}
{"text":"Wow the food here is absolutely delicious ! Staff is very friendly and helpful! I will definitely be coming back GOD allowing"}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite taco truck in town! I've gone to so many and this one is by far my favorite! Love that it's open late too. Tacos dorados and the tostadas are heaven!!"}
{"text":"This has become my all time favorite taco place in vegas. Luckily they're right around the corner from my house so since my first review I have become a regular and here more than twice a week. My son loves their hot dogs he is 6 years old and always orders 3. The first time he asked I said no but I must say he know his appetite. I need to explore the menu a bit more but the tacos are a must for sure."}
{"text":"Best place to eat when you are craving for a late night bite! Very delicious! Dorados Tacos- I fell in love Very pleased that the cashier payed attention to us because they separated our orders to the right plates even when we forgot to ask definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are not very big but they do come pretty packed with meat. They're Al Pastor is amazing and they are very inexpensive. The parking situation there is a bit crazy but the tacos are worth it."}
{"text":"Great price for great tacos. Spent about $9 and walked away with a bit of food. Got some of the fried potato taco. Also dabbled in some El Pastor and Chorizo tacos. I highly recommend this spot for Taco fixes. The order took less then 10 mins. And I was able to get back home. And continue my tv show binging lol."}
{"text":"Tacos in Chinatown? Yep!!!

They are good.  They are better than tacobell and that says a lot."}
{"text":"OMG yessssss. Soooo good!! The pork tacos are the bomb!!! The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here, and this place is legit. I had a carne asada taco,  chicken enchilada, and al pastor taco... pretty damn good.... meat is marinated great and everything tasted super fresh. The menu is pretty simple but don't let that fool you, the food has some good flavor. The inside is pretty empty , but has a salsa bar area and some tables to eat inside. The staff was super nice and friendly. Check this place out, nice to see a ma and pa taco shop on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall adjacent to mini mart gas station. Decor is nonexistent. Big screen TV playing Univision Deportes. 

But you don't come here for the ambiance or lack thereof. You come here for the tacos

Authentic small street tacos. Two warmed corn tortillas with choice of meat. Today was al pastor and carne asada.  Both come with onions and cilantro. There's a simple salsa bar with two red and one green salsas. The meat is tender, moist and we'll flavored. The salsas are appropriately hot. 

The menu is reminiscent of the taco trucks that populate LA. 

One item they also have is tripas. It's always good to see this on the menu. Served on sopa with cabbage and Mexican cheese. 

A good little taco joint."}
{"text":"This taco truck's food is AH-MAY-ZING!! I had the Tacos Al Pastor and my husband had the Carne Assad and they were easily the best tacos that we have ever had!!! After I made a complete idiot of myself by spilling my drink into the container of fresh limes, I settled down and inhaled the three tacos that I ordered. The cart of condiments included limes, salsa verde, pico, jalepenos, radishes and salsa!! I'm sure I'm forgetting something but you get the gist...it was stocked with a complete selection. The truck is located in China town.....random but I'm sure there is a method to their madness. You have got to give them a try!  I'll be back for sure!!! Perhaps everyday I'm in Vegas! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos de papa!!!!! We were in vegas and felt like eating tacos at 1am after a concert and found this taco truck. Everyone we went with liked their food. I ordered 1 order of tacos de papa and had to order another one cuz they were that good. To bad I live in Los Angeles or else that would be our spot."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here all the time.  I really enjoy the tacos.  If you live close like I do there is no more convenient and delicious tacos close by so that make them even better."}
{"text":"Ok, not sure if I was just hungry.  But maybe the best Tocos ever!   Obviously I highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong things but the food was greasy and not that great.  The people were super nice!  I wanted to like it and was surprised that the great reviews didn't not match the food.  It seemed a little old (the food) and the kitchen looked really messy and full of old boxes and dirty.  I'm not afraid of a little dirt but it just all added up to a bad experience."}
{"text":"Wow ! I just discovered this place thanks to Reviews on Yelp. (Gracias fellow Yelpers!).  This is a tiny little place connected to a gas station/ convenience store. It's easy too miss so make sure you look to the NW corner on Flamingo and El Capitan. It's a tiny, little walk -in restaurant with maybe 6-7 tables . I got three of those little soft chicken tacos. They were really delicious.  Small portion but very affordable at $1.50 each. Seemed so fresh, simple and down-right relish! I also ordered \"to-go\" the chicken quesadilla which also was pretty yummy. Small condiment station inside with fresh fresh fresh pico and sauces.  This is my new spot to hit whenever I'm in Spring Valley . Nice Spanish lady seemed to run the show. I think she may have been the owner . She was awesome too !"}
{"text":"Classic street tacos and enchilada's. It isn't a taco assembly line they make each to order. Great food for a great price"}
{"text":"Worst taco truck ever. They wait was unreal more than 30 mins. Not a well run place. And they microwave everything!"}
{"text":"We're back! Ok so the first time my daughter took me here, I got jealous of her order! That's why I'm back to get my own! Love food trucks & this is conveniently located close to where my daughter n myself stay at. They try to promote a Mexican ambience w/their radio station playing on their speaker. lol it's cool n all. Their menu is quite simple n basic but for those of u driving by and want some down to earth Mexican eats, come on down to this spot! You won't be disappointed. So far I've tried their tostada & their asada tacos. As for tonight, I chow down their carne asada fries!  Smooches"}
{"text":"This little taco truck is great! 

The tostadas are perfect, just right amount of toppings so you can hold in your hand and they stay crunchy and have lots of flavor. Variety of great salsa I use every drop. 

It's just a taco truck but the price and quality and nice staff easily earn 5 stars from me. 

They stay open tell 2am on most days. Check them out."}
{"text":"Omg best tacos in Vegas hand down!! Coming from Cali we were always searching for the perfect taco place. Well we found it and will be loyal customers. It's very small about 4 tables but you can get your food to go if you want. The salsa was great, grilled onions and a nopales mix were heaven! Do yourself a favor and go eat!!! Don't speak Spanish well the menu is posted on the wall and has pictures on it."}
{"text":"You might be skeptical since this is a taco stand attached to a car wash / gas station.  Well be skeptical until you eat here.  

The tacos are the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.... anywhere.  Mexico, LA, ANYWHERE.  This is the real deal.  

If you scroll down, you'll see a review from \"Genesis G.\" complaining about a \"language barrier.\"  Jesus fucking christ, how much of a language barrier could you have?  There are 5 kinds of tacos.  Point, smile, and say \"gracias.\"  The people who run this place are the nicest people ever.  I go here a lot, and yeah, sometimes I gotta rely on point and smile and/or my rudimentary Spanish. 

You can see the ingredients in the back, and everything is clean, fresh, just wonderful.  I love this place.  I almost didnt want to review it because I dont want too many people to find it and ruin it!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of tacos shops in my day.
These are the best tacos in Las Vegas!
Their taco truck is really good too."}
{"text":"These guys came out for our school event. They were on time, professional, and patient with us at setting up. I heard all good reviews and they're menu had great options . We will definitely love to have them out again."}
{"text":"The food is good, but too pricey. $5 +tax for small tortilla quesadilla. The tacos are good. The lengua was good. But again $2 +tax for a taco is not so cheap. Parking is not the best either. There's space for like 2 cars."}
{"text":"I came across this taco truck and it was a joy of delicious tacos in my belly. Asada and pastor were delicious, flavorful, and crispy. There tacos are not cover with grease to the point it's overpowering the flavor of the meat."}
{"text":"This spot has the best pastor tacos and most importantly, the best hot sauces in town!"}
{"text":"This taco truck deserves more reviews!!!! 
It's so bomb.. everything on the menu is worth trying!!!
So cheap and so fresh compared to other popular taco places! Carne Asada Tacos & Potatos Tacos are so yummy"}
{"text":"Hadn't had good street tacos in a while.
Chose chorizo, carnitas, lengua and tripa.
Did not disappoint.

Coke wasn't too cold but that's about the only imperfect thing."}
{"text":"Best place to eat late at night after a fun night at the strip. Conveniently located next to a gentlemen club in case anyone is interested(friend said to tell you guys that).

The tacos al pastor are the best! I also have tried their tacos dorados. The tacos dorados have potato inside and they are deep fried.  They have a variety of Mexican sodas.  Their salsa bar is amazing ! They got so much variety in it. 

Take cash."}
{"text":"I don't eat tacos often but WOW this definitely surpassed my expectations! They're also open till 2am so my cravings are satisfied after wanting more and more since the first time I tried it! They have a couple places to sit and eat there too if you don't wanna bring it in your car! The workers are super nice as well. There was music and chill vibes! Great place to grab a quick taco run with friends late night :)"}
{"text":"MISSION: TO FIND THE TASTIEST TACOS ON LAS VEGAS' STREETS

WHO: STREET VENDORS ALL AROUND LAS VEGAS(Brick and Mortars like Los Tacos and El Gordo DO NOT COUNT!)

Nice staff and pretty good tacos in Chinatown next to Tofu Hut....Open for just about 2 weeks, Tacos La Carreta is in a great location and is one of the newer street vendors popping up on the streets.

They have a very extensive menu of items, and one item that caught my eye was their Taco de Papa(Potato) at $.75/each, they're not bad...Think Jack-In-The Box style taco crossed with the flavor of a potato pierogie...reminds me of my mother-in-laws Tacos de Papa. I also tried a Taco de Tripa(Beef Intestine) It was kinda small and still pretty good. Right now, the best Tripa IMO is at Tacos Cancun.

Definitely room for improvement and with time, they'll get better....ALOHA!!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(179/365) \"Street Taco Scramble Round 2\""}
{"text":"It wasn't open when I went today. :(  Even though it says it is open, and the truck was parked. I went all the way across town to get no tacos! So, not a fan. Booo."}
{"text":"Tough time deciding how many stars to give Tacos La Carreta, but the deciding factor was consistency. I've been here quite a few times. I recommend the asada tacos and chicken enchiladas. And if you like authentic horchata get it! During the winter they also make delicious champurrado. Unfortunately sometimes my tacos aren't ALWAYS spot on with flavor but the enchiladas always seem to deliver. I didn't care for the carne asada fries I felt they are lackluster for the price. Also the al pastor isn't the best in my opinion, but I prefer this  place to Robertos or Pepes hands down. Staff is friendly and welcoming, location is small, definitely designed for quick bite or for go to go meals. I dont know who makes the salsa here but they know their stuff! I love the salsa here because its spicy but full of flavor! If you appreciate salsa like I do, you'll love the salsa at tacos la carreta it's homemade for sure, goes a long way. Best fast food tacos in Spring Valley."}
{"text":"Late night early morning taco crave! I must say Great food and Great people! Must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb. Everything we ordered was done up right! From the al pastor tacos to the chili/cheese tamale-all palate pleasing. The workers were all super nice and the serve yourself drinks were ice cold. They also ran us a open tab cause we kept ordering more and more. When I find a place like this I usually don't like to spread the word, cause I know I'll have to wait in line the next time I go, but you guys deserve the business. PS my grandson loved the quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Tacos la carreta.have the best tacos Dorados de papa. O.m.g love them. N the workers  are so nice.they take good care of u ."}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos quesadillas and burritos !! The salsas are very spicy which is must with Mexican food"}
{"text":"I drive wayyyyy out of the way for this fabulous place! Service here is always fast, and I love that when you dine in they serve your meal with real plates and utensils. It's super cheap but they don't skimp on quality. The self serve salsa bar is clean and full of choices that are all covered to maintain freshness. My favorites are the al pastor tacos w/pineapple or the chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"Quite simply some of the best tacos and meat that I've ever had. The flavor is amazing, the prices are great, and the staff is friendly. Sadly, I didn't have time to take pictures before eating them all, but I had the carne asada, pollo, and chorizo in my tacos - couldn't have asked for more. Normally I don't like chorizo (so why get it you ask) but my fiance had a chorizo taco so I tried a bit of the meat, and had to have one of my own. Will most definitely be back many more times!"}
{"text":"I guess I'll go 5 stars on this one.  I found parking right in the lot that it is located.  I got there on the later side (10pmish?) and they were in full swing.  I ordered 5 tacos.  I think I just got carne asada and pastor, but everything I had was good.  The tacos were not tiny and were filled nicely.  I added some condiments on them from the condiment bar.  $1.50 a piece.  They ran out of nopales at the condiment bar, but I'm willing to overlook that as I was not anticipating them to begin with even though they would have been a nice touch.

There are chairs set up outside of the truck for you to eat on.  There are also a few stools on the truck, but those were occupied.

This was exactly what I was looking for on the late night off the strip.  I know that isn't late for vegas, but it was a week night and I had been all busy all day and night previously.

I would return for sure.  I'm glad I found this place on yelp."}
{"text":"I visited Tacos La Carreta when checking out Vegas and I'm so glad I did. This spot is a hole in the wall, cozy, and super good.

You must try their tacos and their tortas. I tried the chorizo and al pastor tacos and they were SO AMAZING. I also tried their chorizo torta and was also very impressed. The owners were very friendly as well. If you're looking for a good spot at good prices, right next to a gas station you will find tacos for a great price."}
{"text":"Honestly the best tacos truck here in Las Vegas, chinatown side of the strip! Been here a few times and never got the chance to write a review for them 

$1.50 Tacos! 
What more can I say, unexpensive and delicious!!!! They have other yummy options such as burritos, carne asada fries, sopes, even hot dogs for your late night munchies!"}
{"text":"YUM! Hubby found a taco spot close to home! Tried the Al Pastor tacos and they were delicious! Love that their meat isn't greasy compared to other places.  Can't go wrong with $1.50 tacos and excellent customer service. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet. Best tacos in Las Vegas. 

This place is just like any amazing taco truck. The truck is run by a small family that spends so many hours on this place. They open at 6pm, and is worth every bite. 

I usually get carne asada and al pastor tacos, marinated pork with pineapple for the non natives, and their salsa, which I stock up on since it's so delicious. 

I've come here half a dozen times since moving here. And they save me from crappy food each time. Yesterday, this is where I came after finding hair in my food at a restaurant across the way. 

It was the first time I had their fried potato taco, which was a slice of home for me (I grew up in Los Angeles if you don't know LA, El Monte if you do). 

Their asada is so tender and flavorful. They cook it to perfection and it is never dry. The al pastor is the same way, the pineapple is subtle but I don't get chunks of it, and the caramelized onions just bring everything together."}
{"text":"Great food truck set up in China town.  I have tried a few of their tacos and all have been great.  My husband is a fan of their version of chitlen tacos.  Great prices and great food for that late night hunger strike."}
{"text":"My hometown is San Diego and with that said, I've been privy to some amazing Mexican food.
I'm a die hard when it comes to trying all different entrees, but do have my favorites.
Tacos La Carreta has by far the most delicious lengua (tongue) tacos EVER.
If you've never had the opportunity to partake, it is a must.
Perhaps the idea of tongue takes you somewhere unable to explore the possibility is food righteousness in your mouth. Don't kid yourself.
The lengua is seasoned to perfection and so tender.. served with the traditional cilantro and onions, few wedges of lime.. you need no more. 
I order three:w/grilled chili's or onions on the side, use the green sauce from the salsa stand then sit in heaven for 10 minutes as I devour my food.
It's walking distance from my house, so once the blistering sun fades in the evening, I take a stroll to their truck.
I'm never disappointed and I always leave smiling. If you love the taco truck revolution you MUST TRY 
TACO LA CARRETA"}
{"text":"This is what some people may call a hole in the wall but the food makes this place totally worth it. The restaurant is just right next to the gas station and has a limited number of tables, but there are always spots available. The burrito was filled with refried beans, Spanish rice, carne asada, onions and cilantro. The place was very authentic and the food had a great flavor. They also have a small salsa bar which compliments the taste of the food. The best part was the price, one burrito and a bottle of water= $7.50! There are not that many places out there offering lunch for less than 10 bucks. So if you do not mind small joints, then you should probably come and try them out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place for great food. Expect to wait though. It's very popular during lunchtime but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican street food!  Wish they served beers.  The food is oso deliciouso.  If Trump had the enchiladas, he'd move the wall to the Canadian boarder to keep the good stuff in the states."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because it's near my house and I'm always looking for the best tacos! I tried everything; enchiladas, pastor and asada tacos, taco dorado and a bacon wrapped hot dog. Everything was so good and priced just like any taco truck. Definitely will be back to this little gem!"}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor are really good. Lengua tacos cost a little more, but just as good. They give plenty of meat. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Their food truck is located outside an auto shop across one of the biggest grocery stores in Chinatown. Interesting location actually. We almost got lost at first since it's close to an intersection. We didn't have a hard time with parking though since we went there late in the evening. They have some chairs set up for those who wanted to eat there but we opted for take out. 

Don't be fooled by the exterior because they have really good food. We tried all their tacos and my favorite was the tripe. The quesadillas was also good for the serving and price. The Carne Asada fries had a nice blend of marinated meat, sauce, caramelized onions, and avocados. They went all out on that one. The sizes of their burritos can be shared among 2 people especially the addition of rice can really make it filling. Overall a great experience. Will definitely try it again next time. 

YELP 100 CHALLENGE: #10"}
{"text":"Great tacos, for $1.50 you cant beat it. Play it Again Sam's is next door too. So if you want a quick dance it's pretty convenient."}
{"text":"I been coming here for like over a year now. The al pastor taco here is fucking sex man. I cum everytime I take bite of my taco. Safe to say, I always leave here with my stomach filled up and balls drained. If you are like me, be sure to bring an extra pair of underwear- not for the shits, but rather for the jizzing in your pants."}
{"text":"Tacos el Gordo and this place are my favorite tacos in Vegas. This place is a literal hole in the wall, pretty small interior and easy to misd if you aren't looking for it. Right next to a gas station.. Good tacos for a good price."}
{"text":"Last minute stop. We originally went to tacos el Gordo on the strip but it was way too busy.

I don't regret coming here. It was a good spot to kill the craving of tacos after a fun night.

I ordered the crane Assad quesadilla. It was really good taste wise but the meat had a bit too much fat for me. Maybe it was my natch. My brother had tacos and
he didn't experience that. 

The employees are nice. We went inside the a building they have next to truck and they turned on heating lamps because he saw me shivering. That's was a nice gesture. 

I'd definitely return to try the tacos. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly staff, and not exaggerating, the best Al Pastor I've ever had! Parking was a little tough but absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"This da place right hurr you go to when you're partied out but still want to grub. :))

It can be easy to miss but just keep your eyes peeled for a blinking cone...or just look for a big white truck! Parking is fairly easy as the place never gets crowded. The place is pretty chill lots of people finishing up their night from clubbing or bar hopping trying to sober up. 

I usually just get one of each of their tacos and carne asada fries to share with my friends. If I were to narrow it to the best flavors though it'd be the tongue and marinated pork :) . As for the carne asada fries they're pretty much average but its a good filler food. 

Other from that it's pretty much self serving, they have the drinks on the side. DON'T FORGET THE SAUCES, it's usually covered but feel free to open up that metal cart. They usually are pretty stocked with everything and if not you can ask them directly for any sauce you want. Prices are $1.50 a taco which isn't too bad. If anything I'm always too smashed too care.

TIP: They add a $1 charge for card so bring cash ^^"}
{"text":"Wow, the price and food quality is amazing. The flavor is so good. It's definitely a hole in the wall, a trailer on a parking lot. If you blink as you drive by you'll miss it. It's fresh to order and everything I ordered was dam tasty. The carne asada and el pastor tacos so good. They give you some grilled onions to go with it. The chicken enchilada was also dam good. I can't wait to go back. At $1.50 a taco it's the cheapest in town. I liked it better than tacos El Gordo so much cheaper."}
{"text":"Cheap and pretty generous meat portion. Loved the al pastor and the lengua, but not so much the carne asada. It was dry and tough. Not sure if they charged more for dining there instead of to go, but they overcharged me by $1 for 6 al pastor taco and 1 lengua."}
{"text":"Hands down, best mexican food I've ever tasted! I can inhale everything they have. They make the best enchiladas I've tasted outside my mom's kitchen. I could eat here every day for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from LA about a year ago and have been scouring this city for authentic LA street tacos every since. I've been to all f the big names taco places, and dozens of hole in the wall joints too. Every time being disappointed and longing for my sweet LA taco trucks.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MY CRAVING FOR AUTHENTIC STREET TACOS HAS BEEN SATISFIED! I just finished eating pastor, lengua, asada, and chorizo tacos and every one was amazing. The lengua and pastor were the best, followed by the asada, and then the chorizo. Even though the chorizo is bottom of the list, it's still better than most chorizo tacos in Vegas.

The staff was super friendly, the restaurant was clean, and my stomach and nostalgia are completely full. If you miss that LA street taco fare, this is the only place in Vegas I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos were good, they were out of lengua so i'll be getting those tacos next time.  Bacon wrapped hot dog was delicious as well, light ketchup next time! Small little restaurant, would have never known it was there unless for Yelp. Now my go to hot dog and taco spot close to home."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite taco places until I found a long dark hair in my rice. Meat was dry and they didn't put onions on."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Carne asada and the tripe tacos are my favorite. Authentic street tacos! I'm so happy to have such a great, and closer option on this side of town . Finally a great taco place is here. Do yourself a favor and skip robertos (the McDonalds of mexican cuisine), and give them a shot. Very friendly and fast service! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. 3 tacos, 5 bucks. The best was the carne asada. Great quality and flavor. Barbacoa was juicy and tender as it should be. I missed a bit of pineapple on the al pastor. For a quick bite or to go, hard to beat."}
{"text":"I really wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service wasn't good, they had a very horrible language barrier. Food was flavorless, I was very disappointed given the reviews I have read.
The salsa station was empty, then we told them that they couldn't even understand us.
I was disappointed, we will never go back."}
{"text":"If you blink, you'll miss this place. It's next door to Sam's Gentleman's Strip Bar. And it's not technically a food truck, more like an oversized tacos cart. 

This place is great for a late nite taco fix. 
Al Pastor Quesadilla is delicious. Chorizo Tacos are more spicy than you expect from Chorizo. Carne asada is not the best quality meat tho, unless you like ur meat with more fat. But if you can eat around the fat chunks, these are decent. And all the tacos come with grilled onions...yum!!

Burritos are made with bomb refried beans. Like ur momma used to make with extra lard. Lol. Horchata was also freakin delicious! 

Go for that Al Pastor meat if u come here. It's super juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Solid taco place, I wouldn't say it's the best tacos that I have had but they are solid--the pastor was good, the barbacoa less so. They are reasonably priced, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I drove by this place twice because it is so small and tucked away next to a gas station. The menu, too, is small, so I pretty much ordered one of everything. Though it may be small, they delivered big on flavor. Everything we tried was seasoned to perfection and full of flavor. My husband loved the al pastor burrito and I am now obsessed with the tripe taco. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"I've spent many a drunken evening here pounding late night tacos.  Hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Driving down Spring Mountain Road at night during commute hours you can easily miss this new taco truck that opened up last week.  But if you noticed the brightly lite interior of a white trailer with a few bar chairs setup right at the counter, then you have spotted Tacos \"La Carreta\".  The visual reminded me of the food stalls in night markets in Asia, but this is way cleaner.

Their menu is pretty simple, tacos, burritos, quesadilla, tortas, paras and even hot dogs.  The portion is smaller but so is the price tag.  I feel that it is portioned just right for you to sample more of their menu.

The Lengua Taco is my favorite of all the items I ordered.  The owner, Juan Carlos, also made me a potato taco that I have never tried before.  My mouth enjoyed the new experience.

The owner and the cashier lady are super nice, and the entire taco truck is kept super clean. Way cleaner than some kitchens I have seen around the Las Vegas valley that conspicuously display their \"A\" rating from the local health inspection.  The food is pretty good, but could benefit from further refinement.  But that is just my opinion, and I am not at all an expert in Mexican food.  

Service is fast and friendly. And after awhile waiting for a friend to arrive, a steady flow of Spanish speaking patrons started arriving.  So that is a good sign I think.

Come check them and support a local new business.

They are currently open only on Friday-Sunday from about 6 to 10pm.

3.75 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome place and awesome food. Small place but packs powerful flavor. Best authentic Mexican food I've had in a while now."}
{"text":"Como buen latino, buscábamos unos tacos callejeros, y vaya que los encontramos!   Es difícil encontrar buenos taqueros en Las Vegas, el personal que trabajan allí muy bien organizados, higiénicos y rápidos.  Muy ricos tacos.  Los de tripa fueron mis favoritos.  Y la tostada de lomo exquisita!!!  Nos miramos a la próxima!  Les recomiendo Los Tacos de La Carreta!  No se arrepentirán!"}
