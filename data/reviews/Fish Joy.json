{"text":"We passed this place for years and finally decided to try it when having cravings for fish and chips.  When what do you know?  It was great!  It is one of our favorite fish and chips places!  The inside is plain but we order takeout and bring it home to enjoy.  The Halibut is great.  The batter is fluffy and the chips are pretty good.  I would give them a 5 but it is a basic place and the gravy is just okay.  It hasn't been easy to find great fish and chips in the city so we are grateful for this place!  What is your favorite fish and chips place in the area?"}
{"text":"Wow is this place good.  One of the best fish and chips place in all of Scarborough.  The fish is delicious.  The fries are nice, gold and crispy.  Definitely coming back to this place."}
