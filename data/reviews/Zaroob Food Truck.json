{"text":"Really good food. The wait was a little long, but food was worth the wait. We had the Addana Kabab platter."}
{"text":"At the Barktoberfest event at Resident Culture: Tickets were not lined up in order so the loudest complaints meant their food was up first. Waited 30 min for a falafel sandwich and chicken kebab platter. Chicken was undercooked probably because others after us were complaining about the wait. One customer got her sandwich and waited 15 extra min for fries. If you can't get the food out it's going to be hard to expect repeat customers."}
{"text":"Service is worse than the food... food is not fresh and it takes forever...save your pennies and don't indulge in the brewery snack... $14 for subpar hummus and falafel. Most food trucks in Charlotte rock... this one does not fall under that...don't even bother trying"}
{"text":"While the food was not bad- 30 min for food truck food is unacceptable. The guy working on the iPad to help customers ordered should have been cooking. Should have had 3 guys working in there. Never take more orders when the kitchen is in the weeds."}
