{"text":"My go to place for the best espresso in the city. Friendly staff. Glad they have a location in the Southside!"}
{"text":"I got a chai latte it wasn't that robust and needed more sweetness! The design on the latte was a nice touch. The 3 stars are for a lacking interior presence. The atmosphere is cold and unwelcoming doesn't match the pleasant faces behind the counter. There needs to be an artistic presence, this place is a white canvas on a bustling street of color and culture! They have a farmhouse feel but seems like they gave up after lighting!!!! The three stars are for a pleasant staff with charming smiles :)"}
{"text":"OMG!   Espresso a Mano,  excellent at there second location!!!   Best espresso in... PA!  Now yep locations to choose from!  I'll a happy girl!   They have more food options in South Side for breakfast and lunch.  Kale and Beet chops fantastic!   Quinoa salad, ferro salads...  So yummy.  But let me tell you their granola oh my God I'm addicted it is so amazing!   it's good plain, it's a good with yogurt, is good with almond milk it's just downright amazing granola. I'm in heaven having my espresso and granola right now... life couldn't be any better!"}
{"text":"Espresso a Mano in Lawrenceville was always my favorite coffee shop, and I'm delighted that the new location lives up to the standards of the original. Great service, a bright, cheery space that's lighter than the Lville shop, and the best lattes in town."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that another Espresso a Mano location has opened and that it is close to home for me! I had to check it out this past weekend, to see how it stands compared to the original location. Located in the old Amazing Cafe, this location is much smaller than it's sibling in Lawrenceville. However, there is a decent amount of seating for studying, work meetings, or dining. They have breakfast/ lunch options here, which is super nice when you're looking for a break and need something to eat. One of my favorite aspects of this location, is the fact that a Pittsburgh Juice Co. fridge is located inside. You can find a variety of juices/smoothies here and if you're lucky, you might be able to snag something off of the $5 shelf! To be honest, the lattes here are not my favorite, and they charge extra for non-dairy milks, which I find to be unfair. However, as you can tell by other yelp reviewers, I am in the minority with that opinion. Although their coffee drinks aren't my fav, I do really enjoy their iced green tea- it's one of my absolute favorites in Pittsburgh. I'm looking forward to trying new teas when I return here in the future! Overall, solid addition to the south side of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that Espresso a Mano moved onto Carson st! After reading about their recent opening I stopped by for a morning cup of tea and the staff was extra friendly. 

Same table set up as the last place that occupied the space, so plenty of seating and I noticed several outlet strips in reach for easy charging. 

They had a nice array of baked goods, plenty of tea options, and their menu of fancy coffee (not a coffee drinker, so it all sounds fancy to me). I've found a new meeting spot on Carson!"}
{"text":"I've been excited to check out this location as soon as I heard about this 2nd location opening in Southside. 
Personally, the Lawrenceville location is too much of a gamble to find a spot because it is so popular.

Firstly, baristas are super friendly (very positive and lighthearted environment) and willing to explain anything on their menu to you.

They sell plenty of breakfast/lunch options that I would love to check out, in addition to the lovely pigeon bagels (I'm an avid fan) and pastries. I got the everything bagel + fig & honey cream cheese along with a matcha latte for the cold weather.

The space is pretty open with lovely mason jar lights hanging from the ceilings and on the clean white walls, along with various coffee-related art and illustrations. This is paired with the lovely flowers spread around on the tables. Even on a dreary weather day, it's a great place to lighten up! 

There are many different seating options: benches, coffee bar, and high tables, and they're all in reach of plenty of outlets. So this could definitely be a great location if you want to grab brunch with a friend and to be able to grab a great cup of coffee and space to study afterwards."}
{"text":"Great concept and I have been on the one in Lawrenceville and I was very happy. On my first visit here I tried the espresso and he was an amazing coffee. The environment is OK. A bit small
Place with nice decor and Places to charge and hook up your electronic devices. The staff is very helpful. The problem is that they are closing early and every time,  I passed by it was closed. What's the point of a coffee shop if they're not open.  You need to do work  in the afternoon and early evening hours and you are Looking for your second coffee for the day. Maybe they're having staffing issues."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Not a coffee or tea drinker! (But I love hot chocolate!)

Can't assist with the lattes or the other drinks on the menu, but the space is great. There is plenty of seating and free WiFi. I really like this coffee shop as an addition to the Southside - it's cozy and well lit and I've always been able to get enough seating for my meetings. I've sampled a few baked goods and they were great - I'm looking forward to returning and trying out the menu, as they have a good number of options listed.

Also, friendly people just make a place better - the staff has always been wonderful when I've been in there. Friendly to me and chatting it up with other customers. Great neighborhood option!"}
{"text":"I love the new Southside location, and I especially appreciate that I never have trouble finding a seat (something that can't be said about the Lawrenceville EAM). 

For coffee aficionados,  I'm happy to report that they brew North Carolina's very own Counter Culture coffee with the occasional guest brew feature."}
{"text":"Terrible espresso. Always burnt tasting and undertamped - a thin gruel with a harsh edge and no nuances. 

Also, the sandwiches are flavorless. They are served with the meat burning hot and the rest of the sandwich lukewarm; they are stored in such a manor that this is the outcome when heated - I presume because the bread and veggies are oil-free, they absorb a lot more moisture than the meat, which freezes when stored, and this does not even out when they heat them.

Very thick tables which have tops too high to use a laptop on; very uncomfortable to type with forearms bent upwards and wrists bent down, or while hunched forward to rest elbows on the table.

The worst coffeeshop in the city. Try delanie's, or starbucks, or the beehive."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great coffee. Their salad is amazing, and I didn't even order a salad (it came in the side of the quiche). Herb cream cheese was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Cute place, friendly staff, but you pay a lot for a little. Makes Starbucks seem reasonable."}
{"text":"Espresso a Mano is one of my favorite coffee houses in Lawrenceville. When I learned about this 2nd location in Southside that was serving both breakfast and lunch I decided to try it out. It occupies the space that formerly held the \"Amazing Cafe\" and is next to Amazing yoga.

Once inside the layout is the same as I remember from Amazing Cafe. The espressos, coffees, etc are listed on a chalkboard. You can sample the blend of the day. You are entitled to one refill  with your coffee whether you choose to have inside or take it with you. 

Inside the baked goods cases I asked if they were made in house. I learned that pastries come from Mediterra bakery in Robinson and the small donuts come from Gluten Free Goat bakery. I have previously been to both of those places and have been exceptionally pleased with their offerings.  So I decided to try a breakfast sandwich. I ordered the smoked salmon with herb cream cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomato. It is served on an \"everything\" bagel. I was told it comes with a side salad or chips. Since it was way too early for me to try the salad they were kind enough to box for me to take home and try later.

Today's coffee was a Columbian blend called San Isidro which had notes of orange, caramel, and milk chocolate. I ordered that for my beverage. They also sell juices that are refrigerated for  about $8.00. They come from the Arsenal neighborhood.

I saw that underneath the tables there were ports so you could charge your laptops, phones, etc. Free WiFi is available. I got my sandwich in record time since the place was fairly empty. I had difficulty cutting it so they helped me with it. I found the sandwich was fair but it was filling. The coffee on the other hand was outstanding and is the same that I've come to love in Lawrenceville. 

After I finished I asked the counter lady if the bagel was toasted. She told me it was and I explained to her that not only was it difficult to cut with a plastic knife but also difficult to chew as well. She apologized for that and explained that this is the first full week of their serving breakfasts and lunches. 

This is a great coffee and espresso place and am happy to see them centrally located in the Southside near the Carson St deli. For now I would recommend the pastries or may try the yogurt bowl on my next visit."}
