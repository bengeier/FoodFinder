{"text":"We went to this restaurant twice and we will never go back AGAIN.   First,it was the new years eve, my friends and i read all the nice comments on Opentable about this new restaurant,so we decided to try it out.Let me tell you,for $95 each,we received the worst service EVER.Our plates took almost 2 hours to arrive on our table and guess what,they were Cold. Since it was a new restaurant, we just told ourselves that it needs some time to bring it together.  Then,the Valentine's day which was One month after the opening,my boyfriend called the place and asked about the informations and specifically asked if it's going to be a romantic ambiance since it was our first valentine's day and we were told that there will be performances but nothing too loud. Even though we were greeted lovely by the hostess,our seat was such a disappointment, they didn't had a coat-check and our seats were so close to the other tables that I could barely move. Our waiter apparently didn't learn his menu and had to constantly ask which course were we,we received more informations about our food from the gentleman who brought the plates than our actual waiter.The plates took a long time to arrive and were surprisingly small comparing to the price. Lots of other couples seem to be rather disappointed about the situation also. (Btw,throughout the whole night,we barely heard any music,the musicians weren't playing at all.)  In total, i won't be giving a third chance to Vicolo."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at their grand opening on the 3rd of December with great music from DJ Abeille and delicious free food everywhere. Vicolo really has a lot to offer and you can tell by a successful night like that one. Read more on my blog: http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/12/10/vicolo-resto-bar-grand-opening/"}
{"text":"Solid food Nice space, very comfortable on a cold December evening *absolutely the worst service, ever! It started with the waiter taking the menu's out of our hands before we had ordered--understandable if the place is buzzing and they're short on menus--the place was 3/4 empty. We had to remind the waiter multiple times to bring drinks, plates for the starters, and a box for leftovers. It took 20 min to get a drink and we ended up leaving without our leftovers because he never brought a box. Sure, we could have asked, again, for a box, but it had become clear that something was off with our waiter. I almost forgot to mention that it took an hour to get our food--not good if you're trying to get to a hockey game. The food is worth 3 stars, more if the portions were bigger (risotto was half a cup at most), but the service was crazy bad. I hope they figure it out, quick."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, food was useless, come on guys 2015 and we are still serving these knock off Italian dishes! For a downtown resto it was sad. Service was great, but that doesn't make up for the most important part of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Vicolo with my colleagues for lunch in January, it was our 'late' Holiday company dinner. We were seated at a table that rocked back and forth. The table legs weren't even and it was pretty bad. Sometimes it's a small rock that can be managed, but this one was not. It's really all in the details, and for a restaurant where people are seated for a while and have to use a table.... well, make it right. We asked to move to a booth. The booth was worse. There is NO SPACE in the booths! I didn't find it comfortable at all.   I don't have too much to say about the service because it was decent on the day we were there. They allowed us to move to the booth without issue and I didn't find we were waiting too long for our food. There were other people there too. The waiter had an interesting character....   Overall the food was good but I was disappointed with the lack of choices. We were able to choose from about 5 main dishes: Chicken, two different kinds of pizza (one seafood [eww, on pizza?] & one vegetarian), beef I think, and what I choose, mini-ravioli. To start we choose from salad or soup. We all choose the soup (it was a cold day!) and it was OK. Nothing groundbreaking... Then we had the meal, which is also OK. I think the portion was good enough. Three of my colleagues ordered the pizza and despite being very thin, it was big and they couldn't finish it all in the one sitting. Since the pizza was veggie, there wasn't much to it. Might have been more substantial if there was meat involved on one of them at least. I was thrown off by the dessert and there was only one choice. It was $3.00 mind you, but it wasn't what I was expecting. The menu said it was \"Apple & Cranberry Crumble\", which I thought would be baked, together, like Apple Crumble is..... typically. But this one was layered with raw sliced apples & cranberries on top, not baked, and the crumble, which was more like granola, was on the bottom. It wasn't baked or warm at all. A little strange, not how my Momma makes it!   I was considering going back again with my Husband, but I read the other reviews about the Valentine's Day event and Wowzers... It sounds like they were *not* prepared that big evening whatsoever and I am really glad I wasn't there. My Husband would have been livid and he would have made a scene if those reviews are accurate. Hopefully they'll do better next year....."}
