{"text":"We decided to try a new place and new food. Unfortunately we waited more  than an hour for our food.  Most of us didn't think the food was worth the wait.  The mofungo was super dry and the pork was mostly fat and very dry. The waitress was sweet but inattentive. Sadly we will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, and I'm glad I did the food is amazing! Literally the best food I've ever had! Please come and support this beautiful family restaurant.. the service is incredible, atmosphere is perfect along with great music! Everything we tried was delicious."}
{"text":"Well it is the only Dominican restaurant in the valley but I must tell you that I love it. They use to have a restaurant in Queen Creek about 2 years ago. It was in a remote area about 20-25 minutes away. We liked it so much we would gather our friends and go like twice a week at least. I believe it was managed by the dad and possibly 2 sons. Now it looks like most of the family is there. Either way its DELICIOS. I come from the east coast where the food is terrific and I take great pride in saying that. This is definitely a place to take care of some of my home sick cravings. If you want a home cooked meal and you like Dominican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, or Columbian food then this is the place to try. The empanadas are good my favorite is the Bistec ensebollado (steaks with onions). Try it out hope you like it."}
{"text":"Our experience was quite good - wife had mofongo with shrimp that was excellent, I had the fried chicken with Moro that was pretty tasty.  Honestly I wish I had tried one of my favorites in the Cuban sandwich though as the fried chicken chunks weren't anything special - would be improved with a unique dipping sauce or something.  The mango juice was ok, but the flavor was just off for some reason that we can't quite pin down. Kids had a standard cheeseburger with fries, plenty for them to share.  Service was solid - attentive to refills and asking how everything tasted.  Restaurant is nicely decorated and in good shape, everything seemed clean and well taken care of so far.  Will definitely go back and explore their unique menu again!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Taste as if you were eating a home cooked meal right in the DR. Even the little one inhaled everything, it's that delicious. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I think this is my second ever 5 star.. But have to. Its not often you get to taste some good food made the way you expect it. Dominican food like Puerto Rican and Cuban have specific flavors. No need to add salsa or hot sauce. The meal is prepared with flavors you will want to go back to. I had the chance to meet Aldo while there as well. His dad can cook my friends.  Do give it a try for lunch and or dinner. We ordered 4 different plates to get the most flavors for the buck. Mofongo, moro, carne frita (fried pork chunks OMG), shrimp was really tasty. Tostones were good as well. I will be back often for lunch specials.."}
{"text":"The best Dominican food in Arizona hands down Great services amazing ppl great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Mambo's, the food was plentiful and delicious! I had the empanadas, yucca frita and mofongo with garlic shrimp. Plan on going back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"We didn't have the same experience as all the 5 star reviews here. The food and service was just ok and the server was polite. I'm just confused as to why this is five star, where are you people usually eating?"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the fried plantains and the chicharron chicken. Hubby had the pork chops and rice and beans. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food Nice place Fair price Nice people Recommended- try it, you'll like it Per very nice waitress, Dominicans cooking Dominican food  Tasty chicken"}
{"text":"Excellent and as authentic as it can get. I always get the lunch of the day. Reasonable prices and fair portions. All lunches of the day give u choices of rice or moro, with a mini salad included.  Very clean place.  Great job."}
{"text":"I was referred by a co-worker who recommended the pepper steak and garlic shrimp.  I got the rice/beans as a side with both dishes and it all was very good.  One of the owners recommended a plantain based dish that sounded really good, I'll be getting that next time."}
{"text":"Food was ok! I ordered a Monfongo which came with bits of bacon. yes i said it.. \"bacon\". they would go out of business real quick in nyc. no true dominican would ever accept that.. stop trying to cut corners and make every single meal authentic with quality ingredients..  Also the sauce needs to be reworked, to watery and not enough flavor.. Also what's up with those prices?! if you want people coming on a regular bases, you need to bring those prices down a bit.  I'm truly writing this with good intentions, because you guys have potential, as there's not many spanish restaurants in chandler."}
{"text":"I came her with my grandparents we really enjoyed the food and the waiter was super nice even though she was the only one and busy. My grandpa ordered the Cuban sandwich and I ordered the beef with rice and my grandma didn't know what to get so she picked out of everyone's."}
{"text":"A very well prepared and presented meal. I had the Tilapia Empanizada and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We tried to go here last night, door said please seat yourself, the place is kinda large probably at least 25 tables. Six of them were being used. We were quickly stopped by the staff as we were selecting a booth along the left side saying \"you can sit but it's  is going to be about an hour\". Right, we probably won't come back. If you can't handle 7 tables on a Saturday night at seven then I can't imagine the food is any good."}
{"text":"I had \"to go\"food - I want to come back when they install the beer ;) I ordered Cocido which was pretty flavorful I'm sure because it had bones in the meat! The Cubano was great! The mofongo with fried cheese and salami -- was interesting, you get a heaping portion of mashed plantains with onions which I've never had before, without the onions it would have been bland. I had to salt and pepper the crap out of them - maybe I should have added hot sauce?  I want to go back to try and see how the service is, and also to try more dishes! So far so good!"}
{"text":"Love the food...Los Tres Gorpes my fave. The people are nice and welcoming. Wish they had the Presidente beer and I'll be set. Perhaps today was the fifth time visiting Mambos. Yes will return!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my fianc√© can't find the words to express how much we loved the food here. The staff was helpful & friendly. The chicken was tender and full of favor. The shrimp wasn't over cooked and cooked to perfection. The Moro (rice with black beans) was something that was sooooo good  that I could have by its self. I would suggest this place to anyone wanting an amazing meal.over all a great experience"}
{"text":"The decor is casual, cheerful, and friendly.  The booth was comfortable and the service was attentive.  The food was good too!  We had the mofungu camarones (shrimp) and the mofungu with salami, fried cheese and two eggs.  Both were savory and delicious.  The mofungu with salami etc was quite rich.  The only disappointment were the beef empanadas, which were overly salty.  I really enjoyed the iced tea which had a hint of coffee flavor to it.  Hard to describe.  The mango smoothie was also satisfying.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is good although they are slow with service. 90 minutes to be served with multiple dirty tables means they are understaffed.  This is the second time this happens to us which indicates the owners are not staffing the business right. :("}
{"text":"It may look a little doubtful from the outside but it is nice inside. The ambiance music makes you want to get up and dance, which my toddler did. The service was good. There wasn't very many people, when we went, and the man who appeared to be the owner/manager changed their tv to cartoons to accommodate my two year old. I appreciated that. The samples appetizer was delicious along with their other dishes. A very home cook feel and taste."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The atmosphere was really nice, as well as the staff. I really felt like I was back in the Dominican Republic. This place is far from me but I plan on going back again. There is nothing better than food from my island."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service, relaxed atmosphere. The Yucca Frita is amaazzzzing!! Everything we've eaten has been great!"}
{"text":"This was my introduction to Dominican food, and I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience. My lunch of mofongo with shrimp was excellent, the service was friendly and prompt, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food served. The menu is diverse, and there are many options to choose from, so whatever your palate, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Well, this visit was supposed to be a pleasant one for my good friend's birthday. It started off amazing, thanks to our lovely, kind server, but took a hard, fast swan dive later. So my meal kind of sucked, but not at the fault of the restaurant. I ordered something I was unfamiliar with and it just was not for me... at all. Here is what really pissed me off and ruined do the night: When it came time to pay, I gave my car to the server, of course. Well, after 15 minutes, finally comes back and says the card was declined, which I knew it was not. She takes the card to run it again, and my friend gives his up to pay as well. After another 15, she comes back and says their machines are down and they can't run the cards. Ok, so what do we do? The manager, I'm assuming, comes out and tells us that he took down our do card info to charge us later. THAT made me mad. You don't take my card info down without asking me first. I would not have allowed it. Thankfully, I was carrying enough cash to cover the bill, and I told the manager to remove and destroy my info, period. For all of this, we were not offered a discount, an apology, nothing. I have a feeling I'm going to see the charge soon anyhow, even though I paid for the meal in cash. Poorly handled situation and I won't be returning at all. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay Vegans! If you're looking for a great resturant to eat good food, laugh, drink and hang out with friend in a Dominican style sports bar/resturant, this is your place! The food is authentic and they have dishes for all appetites! This place is rich in culture! Let me know what you think! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Loved finding a dominican restaurant in Chandler.   They used to be in Queen Creek which was much too far for me.   The place is so adorably decorated with lots of colors, prints, and it is clean and neat as a pin.  Very caribbean looking.   We found the entrees to be on the high side for caribbean food --$14 and upwards.    We ordered the pork chunks with white rice and beans and Mofongo with chicken chunks.  Both came with small salads which was nice.  The salad was fresh but a bit overdressed.  Less oil please. It was just too much. The food came in an appropriate amount of time and looked amazing.  My son loved the chicken chunks as they were good pieces of chicken without bones.  The mofongo came with bacon in it which added to the flavor.  But mofongo usually comes with a side of sauce ( because mofongo can be dry) consisting of beef stew gravy or chicken stew gravy. The sauce they gave us was yellowish, watery and almost tasteless although it was purported to have garlic in it when we asked.  They should improve the sauce.  The sauce that comes with mofongo is EVERYTHING.  Without a good side sauce, mofongo can be too dry.  The sauce they gave us didn't have enough flavor to put it on the mofongo.    The pork chunks, which came with wilted red onions at my request (thank you),  needed more seasoning.  Maybe more garlic and salt.  They were not overcooked which is usually a problem with this dish.  The white rice was perfectly cooked and the red beans were very tasty.    The server was charming and amazingly helpful with all our questions."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this restaurant!  I been craving dominican food for a while now a few years ago there use to be a dominican restaurant off 19th ave in phx but it closed down. I'm  so glad I found this place on yelp I been searching for a dominican restaurant for My fiance because he is Dominican from nyc.  We ate here over the weekend and had the best dominican food experience here in Az. We tried a little bit of everything. You gotta try the red beans with the rice that has beans in it too along with some chicken.  Don't forget to order the morir soniando drink, yucca frita, empanadas,  platano maduros I hope I spelled that right because im native American and I just love dominican food. The restaurant is very  spacious they play good  Spanish music the waitress was very polite she was kind enough to take my hubby's request to play a dominican song. At the time of seating us our waitress name kari made shore to  clean our table twice. She also worked hard serving our food and bartending at the same time. Well we are definitely going back for now on.... People definitely need to try out this  restaurant."}
{"text":"I was down in Chandler this weekend to attend the ballet and wanted to find something different and I was so happy to have happened upon this place while searching in Yelp.  While the food is great in Scottsdale, we don't as much choice when it comes to international cuisines.  This was a gem of a find.  The food is super delicious and a great change to the usual trendy fair.  I had the garlic shrimp mofongo, which was sooooo good. And the fried plantains were out of this world.   The restaurant is clean and the wait staff is very friendly.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice recently. The food is great and service is friendly. I have both times ordered pollo guisado lunch special. I am Mexican, not Dominican; but the food tastes homemade. Pay close attention to the check, first time; they undercharged me. The second time they overcharged me."}
{"text":"I have been here couple of times and really enjoyed the food. Really authentic Dominican style. The service is great, very nice waitress both times. I recommend visiting if you want to try something new and different from the usual."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, and service was great! This place definitely needs to stick around!"}
{"text":"Exploring the numerous flares of cuisines, Mambo's Dominican fulfilled a spot on my plate. Since I have not been to the DR, I can only compare it to Costa Rican food, especially because of the plantains - which is like a starchy banana.   Three of us ordered the following: for lunch:  Mofongo de Camorones - mofongo is a mound of fried green plantains with garlic, oil, and bacon and a side of garlic sauce. Enjoyed the juicy shrimp based in a garlic sauce as well. Side salad with house dressing comes with dish. $16.99. My favorite.   Thursday's Lunch specials for $7.99: - Pollo Guisado/Braised Chicken  - Carne de Res Guisado/Braised Steak Lunch plates come with a side of rice and beans or Moro (which is rice of the day) or vegetables and a side salad. The Moro was like a \"dirty\" rice with beans.   Option add-on items:  For a $1.99 you can add sweet soft fried plantains or tostones (fried dried and pressed salted plantain). Both are great options depending on your liking for sweet or salty.   Decor was interesting because pots and pans and mugs  light fixtures filled the ceiling. Uniquely decorated. Server was kind and dishes were delectable. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has pretty good reviews. However, for me food was bland. I was disappointed because I thought the food would be similar to Caribbean style foods with curries etc. it's a very nice restaurant inside but the food could use some TLC. I had the pork chop. Tasted a little old and rice was ok. Beans were good but could use a bit more flavor. Idk but maybe it's a cultural thing and Dominican food preference is very mild. So two stars is for the price of the food versus the value of the taste. Not a 15 dollar plate for sure. Sorry."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from Seattle and were quite surprised to find a Dominican restaurant in Phoenix!!! We drove 30 mins to this restaurant. We were so impressed! The restaurant itself is huge and has such a nice Dominican vibe to it! Now the food-even better. We both had Mangu Tres Golpes! Wow-delicious. We also ordered the Kipeh and those were good however it did need a little more meat. My husband ordered the sancocho soup To go. It smelled delicious however we weren't too thrilled with it as it had celery, carrots and only one piece of chicken. My husband is Dominican and now sancocho is supposed to have more than one meat. Overall it was great and we even ran into some Dominicans while there!!"}
{"text":"My little ones & I enjoyed our 1st time trying Dominican food.  We shared a meal of one chicken empanada, banana milk shake & one order of Shrimp Mofongo.    The empanada was devoured in the blink of an eye. I liked the seasoning, not too salty. The chicken meat filled the empanada - no big empty gaps inside.  It was shredded & had a good balance of not too dry - not too moist. The empanada had a nice crispy bubbled crust that was not heavy & not greasy.  It's served with a little green chili sauce that I was all about! Mmmm.  I could probably order one for each of us next time & the shared milkshake would be a nice satisfying lunch or light dinner meal for us.   We split the milkshake. it was good too. Creamy & not too sweet. Both girls loved it!   Having never had Mofongo before, I can not say whether it was the best.  But we all thought it was yummy! It was filling. The texture & taste kind of reminded us of potatoes. The shrimp was flavored nicely & cooked perfectly, not chewy.   The place was clean, decorated charmingly with light fixtures made with various cookware, that my girls marveled at & pointed out. The atmosphere is colorful & we couldn't help but dance to the merengue music streaming from Pandora.  We were attentively served by a warm smiling lady Melissa."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place.  The food was so flavorful and filling. I went on a Thursday night during happy hour and to my surprise I had the restaurant to myself. I don't know why....Chandler, AZ you have a gem here.  On this visit tried the Mofongo de Cerdo, a beef, pork, and a cheese empanada, bistec encebollado, there signature Mambo chicken wings are marinated in coconut juices and peppers.  I called my mom and told her to please start putting bacon in her mofongo...Thanks Mambo!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! My boyfriend is Dominican and loved the food. He said it was authentic and great flavor. They even have products that are very hard to find anywhere. Great place! Highly recommend going there."}
{"text":"Our group had a pleasant gathering here, and the place does look conducive to such. The restaurant is very clean with creative decorative touches, such as ceiling lights with skillets and buckets for lampshades. There was only one server that evening but it was not a busy night so it was fine, and the server was very gracious and efficient. I ordered the mofongo de cerdo; the plantain mash was very tasty with bacon and garlic, though a bit drier than I would have liked. The pork bites were bland and overcooked. Overall the experience was OK, though the food I chose could have been a bit better. A return visit is not out of the question, especially since there were a number of interesting items on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Great foods. First time visiting but will be back.  I kinda expected bolder flavors but am certainly not disappointed. Thanks ladies!!"}
{"text":"My family went on Mother's Day as a treat for some real Dominican breakfast. Mangu with eggs fried cheese and salami. We needed a fix of the real deal that we are used to from the east coast and my mother in law's which we definitely got! Delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Being Dominican, outside of anywhere of the east coast is nearly impossible to find any establishment that cooks and serves our dishes.   Have lived in AZ (Tucson) for nearly 4 years.   Did not know that this fantastic restaurant was located in AZ.  It is a great place to go listen to some bachata, merengue and salsa.  While enjoying some delicious dishes.  Definitely one of my top places to eat in AZ.  Gracias por la deliciosa comida"}
{"text":"Popped into this place on a Saturday night and the first thing we realized was the great bachata playing! The food was just as amazing as the atmosphere and authentic food! We will definitely be making a trip at least a few times a month for the fried cheese and salami! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mambo's, the food is made to order and is always delicious. The staff is friendly and the service they provide is efficient. They have affordable lunch special and a great happy hour. Everyone should try it at least once and support this local business. Absolutely delicious! Full of flavor. A must try!"}
{"text":"Went here with an  extremely high recommendation from Puerto Rican cousins  who recently relocated to Arizona.  We consider ourselves Mofongo experts as it's a basic staple of our Puerto Rican family kitchen.   Stopped in on a midweek night and it was virtually empty, not a good sign.  So I ordered the mofongo with chicken chiccarones, boneless chicken chunks that were over cooked with zero hint of any spice.  The mofongo that came with was missing the basic staples of what makes mofongo great.  Missing were pieces of deep fried pork rinds so the mofongo lacked crunch.  Instead they were substituted with pieces of bacon which were way off the mark.  Then, where was the salt and where was the fresh chopped garlic that's supposed to be mashed into the platanos?  And finally the side of garlic dipping sauce lacked fresh garlic and lacked cilantro.  The plantains seemed chewy, the whole dish was off.  With all that said, I will never return again, and will dream of the mofongo food trucks that I ate it in Puerto Rico."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Dominican food this is the place. Being Dominican myself the last place I ever expected to find such a place was in Arizona. Growing up in Miami with an abundance of Dominican restaurants it was actually hard to find one that was really good. The food was delicious and as close to my mom's cooking as it could be, my wife and I both had the \"mangu tres golpes\" which is mashed plantains, fried eggs, fried white cheese and fried Dominican salami (salchich√≥n) all topped with saut√©ed red onions. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for Dominican food. I even ordered sancocho to go (sort of a soup with plantains, yuca, corn and usually chicken, beef and pork sometimes goat). Although it was missing yuca beef and pork it was still pretty good. It did have something I'm not used to seeing in this dish, carrots and celery."}
{"text":"Loved the food - ordered the Pollo guisado con arroz con moros and Papaya Juice - delicious!! Great music and great service!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here to Mambo's. That food was delicious. It reminded me a lot of Panamanian food when I traveled there. Customer service was great as well. The vibe was great as well. Definitely a place to go and eat if you want Caribbean food. My family and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Visited this spot over the weekend for \"date night\".  We ordered...carne and pollo empanadas Bistec encebollado and Chuleta al sarten  These plates came with white rice and delicious beans that go very well together Both meats were cooked to perfection with ALOT of flavor and empanadas were fried perfectly as well.  Service was very friendly, the restaurant had a very warm inviting vibe like you're in a family environment. Definitely recommend this place, I loved it."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuummmmm! Came in for lunch today. The food was awesome ( darn you, yucca fries and your tasty goodness! ) Service was very sweet. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The didn't have the variety I'm used to or specials but what they had was very good. The staff is super friendly. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wrong Order, Dry Pork,  Unflavored Beans and Long Wait  Me and my wife love Dominica Food. The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and clean. We ordered appetizers (empanadas, fried yuca), a pork meal, a chicken meal, and a ham and cheese sandwich for the kids.  The restaurant was not busy since we went at 2:30 on a Saturday but it took a little over 30 minutes to get the appetizers. The cheese empanadas were great and I really enjoyed the green sauce. The beef empanadas just had beef inside. Most beef empanadas have some type of onion or cheese, but this one was only beef with little seasoning.   After we got our meal, about 30 minutes after our appetizers, we noticed the ham and cheese sandwich only had ham. We brought it to the attention of our waitress and she said would tell the cook.   The chicken meal was great so I have no complaints with that platter.  The pork meal was horrific. It was very tough and dry, and the beans had no flavor.   We brought the issues to our waitress and she said, \"I'm sorry\" then handed me the check for the full amount. I asked her what she could do about the dry pork and the ham and cheese sandwich that only had cheese and she just took off 10% from our bill.  My wife did not eat any of the pork and only 1/4 or her rice and beans.   I used to work in the food industry and we were taught strong customer service skills. In this case, the waitress should have: 1) comped the pork platter, or; 2) include a free dessert, or; 3) cut the bill in half   In the restaurant I used to work in, we would have comped the entire meal because of the multiple issues.  If you go here, stick with the cheese empanadas and chicken."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant, nicely decorated and clean.  On this night, a Wednesday, there was only one server, but it didn't matter because there was one other table being served.  The turnout is such a shame because The Valley needs more places like this.  I had the Bistec Saltado, which is a a marinated steak (not sure in what spices, but it wasn't spicy) cut into strips and saut√©ed with onions and bell peppers with a side of rice (You can choose white rice or Moro rice, which is a Spanish rice with beans).  Very tasty and a very large portion, can definitely feed two people, but I managed most of it LOL.  The server was very attentive and filled up our cups of water various times.  In the end, it was a good meal but it didn't astonish me.  I will probably come back and try the mofongo, or something else, but it definitely deserves another try."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant today with 3 friends. I had the Mofongo Shrimp with Garlic.. It was OK.. However, both, the Mofongo and the shrimp lacked salt. I had a side of Spanish rice as well. I paid $16.99 for the dish and $2.99 for the Spanish rice. I believe that, for the portion that I had, it was just too expensive. As a desert I had flan..It was good, but rather small. I am not sure, that I will return, because of the price of the food, which is in no relation to the servings. Another thing that bothered me is, that a couple, who had come in minutes after we did, got served their food before we did..   The server was very nice and helpful, though. The owner of the restaurant also came to our table to ask us, if everything was ok.."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I'm straight from NYC and been searching desperately for a dominican place and my prayers have been answered! I just miss being around my ppl.. my music and more and this did it for me in every aspect. I had the chicharron de Pollo and tostones and the tostones were nice and crispy just like I like em.. the chicharron was good but boneless so keep that in mind. I'm here for the 2nd time and really enjoyed everything EXCEPT for the mofongo! That made me a little annoyed. I ordered a mofongo with chicharron pollo and they put the chicharron(which tasted pretty good) on the side and filled the mofongo with BACON! umm.. who puts BACON in a mofongo.. I'm all for putting a twist to old classics.. but can u WARN A Girl!  OVERALL everything else was good.. the tres golpes was on point and the steak and onions was also delish!  The price is not as good as I'm used to it but that's understandable considering it's the ONLY dominican place in Maricopa county! It's a must go. The owner said he is working on getting live bands 2 perform and even have karaoke nights in the near future."}
{"text":"Food is a 10 Service is a 10 Location is easy and accessible so basically a 10 Personal Opinion: Mambos is as authentic as eating in your abuelitas kitchen! The food is delicious and full of flavor! Melissa (co-owner) is attentive and as sweet as the morir so√±ando (orange cream drink)! We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona thus far. Amazing food with great service. Their meals are very homemade that their food can transfer you to the DR. Definitely a place to go if you are looking to try something new and delicious. These guys deserve way more attention, customers and credit. One of the few very fitful restaurants that always satisfy you and will never change their menu. Please let the word out about this amazing restaurant and give it a try."}
{"text":"After moving back here from living in So Florida for 5 years I was more than excited to see the sign on my way to work one day!  I have to tell you they did not disappoint in any way!  The braised chicken was AMAZING!  I also got an order of the fried yucca and with the salsa OMG!!!  The service was great!  I always love going to locally owned business and supporting the non-chain businesses!!!  Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great music and wonderful people. Perfect place to have fun and eat good tasty food. Love this place to the max. Moro rice with beef sauteed with peppers were amazing. I would eat the same everyday. Empanadas were good too. I'm not sure if they have beers on tap, but good choices of bottled beers. Overall this place deserves all the praise"}
{"text":"I love ethnic food.  Not just Mexican or Chinese.  I love the idea of Peruvian restaurants, Puerto Rican cuisine, Brazilian food, Filipino food, etc.  So when I saw \"Dominican\" I was excited.  Never had that before!  I was looking forward to trying it.  I really wanted to like this place.  But I can't.  The food was not bad.  The fried chicken was cooked perfectly...lightly crispy, not greasy.  The empanadas were light and flaky.  It was all done perfectly.  But it was extraordinarily lacking in flavor.  I would be shocked if Dominican cuisine really is this lacking in robust flavors given that the Dominican Republic is in the Caribbean, settled by Spaniards who brought African slaves.  That's a lot of diverse influences and they produce a fried chicken that is just chicken...no noticeable seasoning?  I don't think so.  Even the mofongo was disappointing.  What is probably a signature dish in Dominican cuisine, and it was so bland.  It is made from mashed plantains, which didn't sound good to me, but i wanted to try it.  And it wasn't bad.  But even with the \"garlic sauce\" (which wasn't very garlic-y) it just had almost no flavor.  The service was very good.  Friendly and responsive.  I really cannot recommend this place.  It's just bland, bland, bland."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The food here tastes very homemade like from someone's kitchen. I imagine a Dominican staff in the back cooking up these delicious meals. I would so come here again! And Melissa the server is so sweet. She owns this place with her husband and his 2 brothers. Family owned, super delicious homestyle. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the people were friendly. The empanadas were delicious. There are chicken, beef, and cheese empanadas. The chicken may have been extra delicious. The entrees pollo guisado (braised chicken) and the cerdo (pig) were very good. The tostones (plantain chips) and maduros (sweet plantain) were also good. We would recommend it."}
{"text":"We tried Mambo's for the first time yesterday. The food is delicious and very flavorful. The only problem Is the wait. I would suggest ordering a couple appetizers from their happy hour menu or you might get hangry. Our server was apologetic and very friendly. Either the kitchen needs more workers or more servers are needed. I had the shrimp with peppers and onions. The Moro rice was delectable. We also ordered Moscow mules from the happy hour menu which was tasty. The ambiance was cool and it was very clean. Impressed with the light fix and menus. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I just ate here for lunch.  It was very good and reminded me of being in NY.  I will be back to try their Mofongo. Waitstaff was very attentive."}
{"text":"So we came here Wednesday night the place was empty. It was our first time here and we just wanted to try something new. So we ordered and it took about 45 minutes after we ordered to get our food.. Food was ok i wouldn't say worth the price and wait. Me and my girlfriend always ask each other after we try a new place, \"Would You Come Back?\" and our answer was no."}
{"text":"El mejor lugar para comer. En este ciudad del Diablo. Menu super y presidentes frias."}
{"text":"Been excited to try this place. We went later in the evening and were spoiled by the staff; very attentive and friendly. Decor is really nice, good music, few TVs playing music videos and sports games. To sum up the food: FRESH & flavorful!! We had tostones - cheese empanadas - salad - fried cheese - salami - chicharrone de pollo - bistec encebollado - moro - arroz con leche. The portions were generous and priced appropriately. We were told they'll be getting Presidente beer soon too; can't wait!! Looking forward to returning, so much I still wanna try"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, empanadas, yucca, and green sauce. Impressive flavors and unique menu."}
{"text":"My first time trying Dominican food and it was really Tasty! Customer service was awesome. The owner even let me sample since I was scared to try it for the first time. The restaurant was very clean!! Check this place out if your looking for good food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC so I know about different  cultures and one of my comfort food is Dominican food.  We finally found a place that reminds me of home.   As you walk in, your greeted by a friendly  hostess who seats you quickly.  The tables are so old school with plastic table clothes but Ilove it!   The menu is cleverly attached to a cutting board.  The menu stays with the classic tradition of authentic Dominican food. This is great since AZ needs a little more diversity when it comes to food and BOY does this help!   Try everything once!  We had a party of 8 and everyone ordered something different which made it so much fun!   We had braised Chicken, grilled chicken, garlic shrimp even Chicken Alfredo.  I know! WOW... DELICIOUS!   Everything we ordered had flavor for days and you get plenty of food, enough to take home.   The selection of beer was limited but the sangria was amazing.   DESSERTS..... coconut flan, Tres Leches.... I can't anymore.    This is a cultural experience that everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Authentic food and environment.  I had a Cubano with plantain chips all was very tasty.  The Cubano had a lot of meat and came out hot.  Service was good also, every time my drink was empty the waiter filled it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I have found my happy place! I had the mangu which comes with salami, fried cheese and eggs. I am definitely coming back to try the chimi burger and mofongo! Really cute place with friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! This place is overpriced and the food is bland. Monfongo was overpowered by the bacon bits & drenched in a creamy sauce. The pollo a la plancha was orange but had no flavor! Not to mention the place smells like cat litter."}
{"text":"So tonight my banana was split! Jk. Instead of my cherry. Apparently, the Dominicans love bananas and plantains. A lot of plates have so form on plantains. I have the Mofongo. It was interesting. It was harder then I thought. It was almost like bread texture but denser. It was good. I got the pork mofongo. The pork was pretty fatty and a little dry for my American taste. The place did not seem too busy but it took over an hour to get our food. But when we started eating, a very large page of more than 20 people came in that had ordered ahead and put the kitchen behind. The staff was very nice and recommended a lot of tasty stuff. I will definitely go back to try another plate."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall but the food was top shelf. tje service was good, the food was great and plentiful. I had the braised beef and it was cooked just right and had amazing flavor. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This will be my new home for a long time. We went here when they where located in Queen Creek, we are going to keep coming here more because it's finally down the street from my house. Have patience people, it's worth the wait! My Cuban and Dominican family loves this place and will always be here."}
{"text":"Loved their pork bits and plantains! Great customer service with an enthusiastic atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"The menu is interesting and the food is tasty.  The fried yucca and sauce was strong while the sweet plantains and grilled chicken flavorful.  Sangria and lots of other beverage choices abound."}
{"text":"First foray into Dominican Food. Delicious! My good friend is Dominican and recommended this place to us. We definitely will be back to enjoy the great food once again. The mofongo was outstanding and left us so full and pleased. The food is authentic and made with great care."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, eclectic decorations, and yummy food. We had the beef empanadas, tostones, and the mofongo. The empanadas were delightful especially with the green sauce served with them. Tostones had me wanting to order more just for the drive home. The mofongo was a bit on the dry side but the garlic dipping sauce certainly provided another depth of taste. Good portions. Had mofongo to take home, which I won't do again. Does not reheat well. But, overall, Mambo's gets five stars for me in terms of being a bit different from the usual AZ fair, the super nice gentleman who greeted us and equally kind wait staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Mambo's for the first time today after searching Yelp for quality local cuisine. We are both big fans of Dominican/Ecuadorian/Peruvian/Colombian/Puerto Rican food and have enjoyed it all over the world. I must say we were quite impressed! The atmosphere was pleasant, with one Latin hit after another making us dance in our seats. Everything looked to be very clean, which is very important to me. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. I can't remember her name... Everyone there seemed very nice! And above all, the food was hands down to die for!!!   I enjoyed the salmon with Moro (rice and beans)... The fish was cooked just right with delicious flavor and the Moro was yummy too! My husband had the \"Mambo Platter\" (pork, fried chicken, and Tostones)  and I kept stealing bites from his plate! It's listed as the first appetizer on the menu, but was certainly more than enough for a full meal. We shared a cheese Empe√±ada and it hit the spot! The Tostones (salty fried plantains) and the Maduros (sweet fried plantains, which are my absolute favorites) were some of the best I've ever had (and I've enjoyed them in places like Quito and San Juan)!! Even the salsa for my green salad and the salsas that accompanied the dishes were excellent! To top it off, the Naranja (orange juice) was just perfect... Not too sweet or bitter. My husband enjoyed a couple of the Mojitos, which looked delicious to me!  I am currently expecting and I anticipate returning to this spot often to fulfill some of the crazy cravings I've been having, Lol! I HIGHLY recommend this little mom n' pop shop and will gladly be returning very soon!! Two thumbs WAY up!!! Que riqu√≠simo!!"}
{"text":"Our group hit this place this month and it was a nice experience.  The place is about medium size and simply furnished.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and willing to answer any questions we had.  We started off with a few appetizers that were really good.  The Yucca was cut like home fries and served with a really flavorful cilantro sauce.  Then we all ordered several dishes to try, Mofongo w/de pollo (Chicken) & de cerdo (Pork), Cuban Sandwich & Bistec (Steak) Sandwich.  Everything was good.  I really like the Mofongo, nice and garlicky..."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food and great service!  My cousin and our daughters came in for lunch and ordered the braised chicken and mofongo with salami, cheese and fried eggs. We were not disappointed with either dishes, everything was seasoned and made perfectly! This restaurant is a wonderful contribution for diverse foodies out there!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the empanadas but they were very disappointing. I ordered chicken and beef. To be honest after the chicken I didn't even give the beef a chance. So the wrapper the pastry portion only tasted of grease, maybe their oil is old I'm not sure but there was no flavor but grease. The chicken empanadas are only filled half way. So I had to eat half of just the outside and half way through I hit the chicken. It's just dark meat chicken with not a lot of flavor, it has a bit of marinade but not much at all. Half full for $2.50 is disappointing."}
{"text":"Incredible authentic food!! The food came in quick, and super delicious. You can taste the quality! Everyone was really nice and polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour bucket of beer and a huge appetizer plate. We didn't get that but we saw someone and it looks like a lot of food. Saw the pictures on Yelp decided to get the Cuban sandwich it's the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had we also tried mofungo with the chicken the garlic sauce that comes with it is delicious we tried a chicken empanadas and a beef empanadas they were super flavorful the service took a little long"}
{"text":"Went to this place after a friend recommended it. We got seated right away but after 20 minutes of waiting for at least to be asked if we wanted water we decided to ask a waiter randomly if someone can please take the order. One of the girls ( the only one that actually took care of us after the waiting) made sure that everything was taken cared off. I forgot her name but she was working at the bar the night we went.  Food was good-that's the only reason I'm rating this place-  Edit: I remembered the name of the waiter that took care of us after the long wait. Her name is Dulce.! Really great person!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and was not disappointed. I have not been to the Dominican so I cannot vouch for the authenticity. I have been to Puerto Rico and tasted mofongo before, but, as expected, it's a little different but still delicious. I went for the empanadas were delicious, all flavors, even the guava, which was more like a dessert. Service was also good. Overall good experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was bomb! Clean environment, my waitress was very friendly and not in an irritating way. Being from Guyana, South America I love flavors and my all time favorite  green plantains. I will be going back for early date night.  I got the special, braised beef,peas combined with rice and tostones...that added with an alcoholic drink was under $20."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but it's not great either. The service is a little slow, seems like they need one or two more servers."}
{"text":"Great service and welcoming staff. Empanadas were better than the 3 Puerto Rican restaurants I've been to and the Cubano was ridiculous. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. I was quickly seated by a beautiful waitress. I ordered a strawberry milk drink and mofongo de pollo. The decor was pretty and the Latin music lively. They had many things on their walls of Dominican culture. It was steady in business and sports was on the TVs.  First a salad came out and it was delicious. They did check on me a couple of times which was nice and everyone was sooo nice. I also had a morir sonando that was suggested to me by another beautiful waitress. In all this place has a lot going for it. All my drinks and food were great and now I'm stuffed haha."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was pretty bad. I ordered the pollo guisado and it was very bland and flavorless. The chicken was so over cooked that the bones were beginning to break down and it was in this flavorless watery sauce. The dressing on the salad that came with my meal was overly salted as well. My boyfriend ordered the Cubano and it was just okay. The food was overpriced for what it was and the quality of it. It is very obvious that the food is not fresh here."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Soooo yummy! The yucca fries are a must try. We only ordered appetizers this time. We got the mambo plate, amazing. A little \"dry\" but use the lime and it's great. The texture makes you think it's dry, but it really isn't....  thank you again for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food and the place feels like home. Fun music and great atmosphere. Definitely coming back. The only downside is that the service is a little slower than ideal, so wouldn't come here if I'm in a rush. Check them out!"}
{"text":"My Dominican food experience is very limited, so take this for what it is worth.  The waitress was great at explaining what some of the dishes were.  We started with an order of Chicken Empanadas.  I seriously could've had just these for lunch.  The two sauces that come with were really good.  One was slightly sweet, the other has a slow burn but it wasn't like \"This girl is on fire\" burn.  More like a \"Proud Mary Keep on burnin'\" burn.  I ordered a Mango and Papaya Natural Juice with milk.  It was heaven in a glass.  My husband had the braised beef with Moro Rice.  I honestly liked it more than the Chicharron de Pollo and Mofongo that I ordered.  The beef is a little tough, but the flavor makes this dish.  The Moro rice was good.  Think Spanish rice, but with more flavor .  We also ordered a side of the white rice and beans.  That was really flavorful as well.  I had the Chicharron de Pollo with Mofongo.  The chicken and the garlic dipping sauce was really good, and is a good choice if you are unsure of what to order.  The Mofongo, I thought was really good.  It is mashed plantain and bacon.  It is really heavy, so I couldn't eat a lot of it.  I don't know what it is supppsed to be like, but this was fairly dry, and served with a sauce on top of it.    Overall, Mambo's is good!  It's nice to have something different and to support the smaller, non-chain local restaurants."}
{"text":"la comida de mi isla - the food of my island.  coming from ny where these types of restaurants are everywhere i really missed this.  Close to my house , the food was great but a bit over priced i mean come on you know in ny a breakfast of tres golpes is like 6 bucks the max and platanos here are 68cents so idk but it reminds me of home and satisfies my urges of dominican food without having to go to mamis house.  I love it."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time a few weeks ago, awesome atmosphere friendly host and SUPERB FOOD! Going again tonight and having desert this time!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Dominican food. Going to this restaurant brings back fond memories of Dominican Republic."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! The Cuban sandwich was out of this world. Best I've had to date in Az"}
{"text":"Excellent. Staff so friendly and want to accommodate you. Food Delish. Had the sliced steak with peppers. Yucca fries are awesome. Husband had the Cuban Sandwich. Great portions. Will be back"}
{"text":"I love Dominicans!! This is my all time favorite and the music, the waiters and waitress are so friendly and welcoming! It's just a little taste of the DR in our desert.  My family is Dominican and they said this is the closest to home for them! Please check in and support this awesome establishment!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The minute you walk in the door you feel like you are home in the Dominican Republic. Everyone is super friendly and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, this place was iight. My mom wanted to come here after hearing a lot of hype surrounding the place so we decided to give it a try. The service was great but the food was sorely underwhelming. I had tried a couple of different things including the empanadas and was not very impressed. If you are looking for extremely flavorful and unique at this establishment, you're going to have a bad time..."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Staff took great care of us even though we came in late and they made us feel right at home. Empanadas had amazing flavor. Garlic shrimp mofongo was wonderful. Pork bites were tasty. Very satisfied and will come more often even though we live an hour away. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this restaurant open and couldn't wait to try it - we arrived as a party of 4 with 1 child - the child ordered a hamburger the adults ordered Cubano sandwiches and a Dominican burger - the two burgers were the same - frozen, pre-made patties cooked on a grill. The difference was the price - one was $4.99 the other $11.99.  The sandwiches were OK - the pork was thick sliced and had some gristle running through it.   The service was good but it took 35 min for us to get our meal.  Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is where ma it's Cuban food used to be and boy am I glad Mambos is here now instead! Their food is not only clean and delicious, but the customer service is so on point. I work near by and they are always respectful of our time during a lunch hour. The food is authentic and the Moro rice is my favorite. You will need to try the plantains and empanadas!!! Carne de res guidada is the best I have had in the west and the pollo is also super good too. Top it off with el jugo fresa and call it perfect. Food and experience are always enjoyable. And their decor is super cute too. Reminds me of my trips to Miami when I am missing the beach atmosphere in the desert."}
{"text":"Love the food. A little too far since is 45 minute drive for me but sometimes is worth it considering the taste and Caribbean environment you'll feel. Great place! Which they had one in the west side of Phoenix or Glendale"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and super tasty food! My cousin and I visited this place because of the positive  Yelp reviews and I  happy to say that it really was great !  The food had great flavor and our waitress was so friendly and nice ! I highly recommend and can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I attended a small group gathering at Mambo's the other evening.    I walked in a few minutes later than everyone else, so I did not give the menu as thorough of a reading as I normally would.  With that said, I am fairly well-versed in the cuisine.    I went with the Mofongo with Chicharr√≥n de Pollo.  The mofongo had bacon mixed in.  That was a first for me.  I'm a firm believer that EVERYTHING tastes better with bacon, so why not, right?  But the chicken... it was just kind of dry and bland.  I went with the chicken to be a little healthier than the pork version and tried a piece of a fellow companion's pork.  That was equally dry, but had a lot more flavor.  I should have gone with the pork!  I also took advantage of the happy hour deal and enjoyed a $5 mojito.  That was the best part of the meal for me.  As far as decorations go, I have to give their lighting fixtures a quick shout out - they use upside down frying pans as lights.  Cool, industrial, and different.  I like it!  When I'm in the neighborhood again, I might give Mambo's another shot.  ***THREE STARS***"}
{"text":"I've  lived in Dominican republic for a year or so and I can tell when food is authentic this place is just that. The decoration is cool they used pans as lamps. I got the monfongo a LOT of people review it as dry,  it's suppose to be like that. They provide a garlic sauce to wet the mashed platano. I like to add lime juice inside the garlic sauce to give it a touch.Will come back because of the salami Frito and queso Frito. Fried cheese and salami which is a classic dish in DR with fried platano. There was a long wait in between ordering and receiving food but it was a busy night so can't complain that much."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times and we love it every single time and I wish shown up the service is awesome the food is definitely delicious you will not regret coming to this restaurant Ambience is very good good"}
{"text":"Es mi segunda visita y de nuevo la Comida excelente, Buena variedad de entradas, y platillos, ademas de un muy buen servicio. Las empanadas son tienen muy buen sabor, recomendada la carne guisada y el pollo guisado."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a restaurant to experience what I could only imagine from viewing the Travel Channel episodes of Dominican / Cuban favorites !!! And coming from home state of N.Y. made it more special !!! I tried the Cubano and Wwwooo so I'm really looking forward to my very soon return! Emely provided the friendliest and attentive service !!! And she not hard to look either : ), the atmosphere and deacor is very creative, and the place is Extremely CLEAN! !!! Even the Bathrooms !!! IT\"S A MUST TRY !!! Lastly you must TRY the desserts, I'm not able to pronounce it yet but it's the BOMB !!!  Victor B. Repin the Buff"}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations :) & Wow did they exceed them!! The service was GREAT! Very attentive, and super fast. The food was so flavorful, they have this green sauce there that is perfect for dipping the tostones *fried plantain* I mean just GREAT! I will deffinetly be going back weekly, I am so happy to have found this gem! Almost forgot the music  for doing your happy food dance!"}
{"text":"Eating at Mambo's was a pleasant surprise.  Six friends and I went there and everyone was delighted with their meals.  None of us had eaten Dominican food before and we relied on our waitress for suggestions.  Three of us had the steak with onions and red and green peppers which had wonderful flavor.  One had a chicken dish that was sort of a stew and the loved it. Two had a shrimp dish they raved about, and one had a variety appetizer dish. The portions were more than adequate and the prices are moderate.  The service was attentive.  This was a hit on all counts and my friends and I will be back and will recommend it to others.  The menu has pictures of the various dishes which helps in ordering, especially if you are not familiar with the cuisine."}
