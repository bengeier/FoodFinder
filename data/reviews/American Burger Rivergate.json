{"text":"Recently rebranded to American Burger Co, have to say my first visit was nothing short of stellar. The manager was more than courteous, caring, the staff was polite & very attentive. It's been a long time since I've been to an establishment that genuinely cared about my experience to the level that this team did. Not mention, the burgers are to die for! Kudos American Burger Co!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My sweetie and I both had our burgers cooked perfectly. I like medium well and he likes burnt. Price is fair for the size of the burger. Outdoor dining was nice with great 80's music playing."}
{"text":"Although the food is good here, the place has gone way downhill over the past year.   Service is still adequate.   Not as clean as it used to be, tables remain unclear and bused.   Floors are filthy.  No splenda or Dukes mayonnaise anymore.   Coke machine sprays syrup on you so look out!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good hamburger and, my favorite, turkey burger. You can have the toppings you want, and unlike other places toppings are included. (Except cheese). 
You order at the counter but service is to your table. The service is great. Halfway through our meal we were asked if everything was great several times. - it was."}
{"text":"Our experience was fine. 

Service was fine. Food was fine. Not much to say. The food isn't craveable, but it was fine. 

However, this place is in serious need of a deep cleaning, painting and general redecorating/updating. 

We probably won't be back just because in this category there are other places with much more memorable food."}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager to reaching out to me after my last review.  He mentioned that we could still get things that BT offered, just ask for it - like the cajun seasoning.

We have since been back to American Burger a couple of times.  My husband still builds his own and I usually go for the pimento cheese burger with additions.  Fries are good too.  Still need to try the fried pickles.  After giving it a couple tries, we are really liking this place.

The only con since my last review, BT's used to be in the coupon magazine that comes in the mail and I have never seen AB in the magazine.  We took advantage of those, so we probably in turn make it out to AB's less, but we still come here and enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is the first time that my fiancé and I have tried this restaurant and I'm sad we didn't find it sooner! The server/cashier (I believe her name was Deidra), was awesome!  She was super excited that this was our first time and explained it all to us and was very personable. The food was no disappointment either. I ordered the Route 66 burger and it was cooked exactly the way I had asked. The sweet potato fries were made fresh and were so good with the cinnamon butter!  I suggest if you're looking for something delicious and quick, you have to come try American Burger.  We will definitely be visiting again in the future!"}
{"text":"I had the santa fe chicken... wow! It was perfect. Paired it with fried pickles and they were really good. The staff is nice, and do everything they can to make your order special. Maybe one day I'll be brave enough to try a burger, but not until I'm bored with the chicken side of their menu!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  Was not disappointed at all.  I ordered the Amigo burger.  Perfect combination and right amount of heat.  Husband had the Rise and Shine.  Also very delicious.  Cooked perfectly.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Definitely a place to frequent!"}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, and affordable! Omg I ordered a turkey burger and it was delicious from the first bite to the last. I recommend this place if you love a juicy burger!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was more than I expected but I have had better. I had a classic bacon cheeseburger. I appreciated the char on the burger. Not bad for a chain restaurant and also affordable."}
{"text":"I just can't brag enough about how delicious these burgers are. I am a visitor here and I can't wait to get back home to SLAP jkjk my momma for not telling me about this place."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill fast 

1 very little people  were there @ 7 pm on sunday

2 when I was ordering a build ur own the cashier/manager interrupted me and explained not to order ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise because they were the table..k that's new ... could explained the new policy a bit nicer (no biggie, I am big boy) 

3 the service was the slowest we had experienced there; ever since been going there

4 the burgers were under seasoned and tasted different 

5 the soda machine was down... told us after we paid?  A bit shady...

6 onion rings tasted funny and bitter, the fries were fine. 

7 never heard of blazin sauce

Overall: not heading back and can't recommend. Too many good burger places by this location. 

Sad night out with the wife and kids."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger joints in the Charlotte area. The Route 66 is my favorite (add jalapeños) served on a delicious Brioche bun. Special shout out & super thanks to Michael for making sure everything was on point and fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers; not remarkable.

Service sucked. Cashier was a surly woman who has no business working in any service role. 

No reason to return"}
{"text":"Neat little place. The turkey burger is delicious and I liked the fact that you can customize your burger and that there were so many ingredients to choose from."}
{"text":"I used to eat here when it was BT's so I went today to check it out.. I will NOT be going back. probably the worst burger that I have ever had and trust me, I have had quite a few. I couldn't get over the price as well. I don't mind paying but Jesus Christ, I don't want to pay Ruth Chris price for a Mcdonald's quality burger. Hell, I think a Big Mac would have been better.

Bubba"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I had the California turkey burger which was decent. Husband had a cheeseburger. I tasted it and it was pretty dry and flavorless, but not inedible. The fries were tasty. The guy at the register was very friendly."}
{"text":"To be honest, you can get a comparable burger at McDonalds as far as size and taste. I was seeking a great burger and didn't get anywhere close. No."}
{"text":"Updated review....

Well our last visit did not go as planned giving them only 2 stars; as there were some challenges with the presentation and assembly of our large order. 

Shortly after a few weeks time the manager contacted me and thanked me for the feedback and ensured things would be corrected.  Today the family I did returned and it was a complete 360. Staff extremely polite and welcoming. Staff was busy either cleaning or helping customers while stopping by each table. Our order was correct Hot and Fresh. Equally impressed as our food looked like something from a magazine. Well dressed and cooked full flavor burgers and fries. Hot fresh and ever so juicy good to the last bite. Thank you resetting expectations and making my return visit with family as sure hit. Thank you for taking honest feedback and incorporating those changes into a well run enjoyable product. 

We will return :)"}
{"text":"Well after seeing the mixed reviews I wanted to give them a shot.  Well I agree that this place could use a change in staff.   The girl at the counter should be sweeping floors or washing dishes.   Not talking to people.   I also could tell there is a negative issue with one of the cooks as how she looked back at them to tell them to make mine med rare.   Witch brings me to my next issue.  Ownership/management should look into serving the fries in a separate basket so when you do send your order back due to not being correct they could save the fries and not have to hand over a new order of them.  May save quite a bit of cash since they have no clue how to make a burger med rare."}
{"text":"Used to be BT Burger Joint. And to me. Nothing much has change.. The customer service is ok.. The burgers is the same as when it was BT.. I ordered the classic burger with grilled onions, cheddar and Swiss cheese with lettuce wrap as buns. The burger was very juicy and I like just as it was done when it was BT. But the lettuce was two thin pieces. Wasn't what I was expecting. I just ended up eating it with a fork and knife. I wanted a couple more pieces of lettuce to eat like a burger. Guess I should've said extra lettuce. My son didn't like his burger, when I asked him why. He said it just didn't taste like before but couldn't explain why. But he loves their tater tots and vanilla bean ice cream. I didn't understand why American took over. I'm guessing American is a chain.. But I'm sure this won't be my burgers go to. If I'm craving it badly then maybe!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my family after seeing a neighbor write a review on a neighborhood website. I must say, for a burger place they are definitely EXPENSIVE, I would dare to even say over priced. They offer no meals on the menu that include a side. You must purchase everything separately. If you choose to build your own burger instead of one of their signature burgers you will be charged essentially for every topping you add. For a family of 4 to spend over $50 on burgers and fries is outrageous. I will not be returning. The food was subpar, just ok nothing fantastic. I'm just stuck on the price, and for that reason alone, in all good conscience I can't see myself in that place again."}
{"text":"If you like the overwhelming taste of an uncleaned grill, go here. The burger was so strong of a \"flame grilled\" taste that I had two bites, felt sick and couldn't eat anymore. Don't waste your time, go to Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order and my car died on the way to pick it up. Manager was so awesome in helping me replace the order for delivery. He remade all the food so it would be hot and fresh. Order isn't here yet but I'm sure it will be great and I am so grateful for people like him! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Update to previous review. Was excited to see American Burger company in place of BTs due to poor service on previous visits to BTs. Went inside and was very disappointed to find that this is the same restaurant, just rebranded. 

Gave it another shot since we were there. Food was slightly better than before. Service improved with obvious focus of new company. Manager was nice. Like the environment, just wish the burgers were on par with 5 Guys or Cook Out."}
{"text":"I ate here about 1.5-2 years ago and had a phenomenal black bean burger! Today, I stopped in because I was in the area and asked for the black bean burger. With the 12 minute wait, I anticipated that it was going to be just as great as the first time I tasted it.  

It has changed so much and if they all taste the way mine did, I would remove it from the menu completely. I was short on time or I definitely would have turned back around and asked for something else or my money back! 

Black bean burgers are solely made of black beans. This one looked like a pre-made frozen patty with very few black beans, a lot of corn and I'm not quire sure what else was in it as it looked more like a vegan pattie with black beans mixed in it. THAT IS NOT A BLACK BEAN BURGER! 

I wish I would have took a picture. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and an owner that appreciated his customers' business. The pretzel bun is delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered that chicken teriyaki sandwich with pineapple it sounds very good but it was so salty I couldn't finish the sandwich with that I had a healthy portion of coleslaw which is probably the most boring thing I've ate. I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the Chicken sandwich.  On menu it says chicken breast.  What I got were 2 chicken strips.  For $6.00!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner. We've gotten food from here a few times and it was a hit and then a miss. Today was a hit.
The employee that served us today was knowledgeable and very nice. 
My wife is celiac and needs to eat gluten free. When we received our food, the employee reassured us that the fries were cooked in non contaminated oil. Very much appreciated. It's the little things that make a place stand out. 
Regarding the food, I had Carolina burger which was cooked great. I didn't care so much for the taste of the chili, but I still cleared my plate. 
 My wife had an American burger with gluten free bun. The burger was cooked great but the bread left a lot to be desired. Something we have come to expect. My son had a Route 66 which he enjoyed. 
In closing, the experience was lovely and we will be back when craving a burger in the Steele creek area."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. My build your own chicken sandwich was missing the pico de gallo I paid for and there was no side of mustard. The fries were so salty I could barely eat them. Such a big disappointment. Definitely not worth the price I paid. Save your money and go to cook out fast food chain."}
{"text":"Teidre is the girl you want to order with. She is the most personable person I've ever met in a customer service position. She remembered me the second time I came in and genuinely asked about how I was and where I had been. Besides the food being great, the company and atmosphere provided by Teidre and staff made me want to come here everyday."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Visited this past Wednesday afternoon. First time visiting American burger. I ordered a turkey burger and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I am not completely sold on this burger joint when there is so much competition nearby but it is a definite improvement over the previous company. 

The layout is the same and the concept is similar. The burgers a about a dollar more than they were when it was BT's burger joint but more flavorful. I built my own burger and it came out fairly quickly. It had two and a half small slices of avocado which was a bit of a letdown considering they charged $2 for it.  I am sure I will return and order their mac attack burger which I missed on my initial survey of their menu."}
{"text":"We loved it when it was BTs. My favorite was the sweet potato fries with the honey butter sauce. The burgers were always great as well. It seemed like the patties were larger and handformed. Now that it's changed to American Burger the sauce for sweet potato fries is different (and not nearly as good) and the burgers look like frozen patties that are charbroiled. Huge disappointment. This WAS seriously one of my favorite places and my #1 choice for a burger. Sadly, we won't be back :("}
{"text":"First time trying American Burger for Valentines Day they gave away a free burger at their River gate location. Knowing it was free burgers I knew that it would be a wait or line out the door. We made it just in time before the line started . Their burgers did not disappoint mmm We all tried a different burger an we all agreed awesome an we will be back. I had a cheeseburger , fried pickles an there Reeses cup cookie. My friend got the Hot Mess burger lol  She loved her burger an it had fries on it lol If your looking for a great burger stop by American Burger its a great burger. The staff was great an I love when a place plans for a crowd. You could tell they had extra staff for this event an our burgers didnt take long at all . When I ordered my fried pickles at the register he told the kitchen so dropped them in the fryer ASAP . Cant wait to try another burger next time"}
{"text":"I expected this place to be at least 10 times better than a fast-food burger joint because it is a restaurant where chiefs actually cook food. I got the rise and shine burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is average, I would say pretty much it has the same quality and taste as the burger from Wendy's. The \"toasted\" buns are soft and soggy. The smoke bacon isn't smoky at all, it's just like the bacon you eat every morning. The whole burger is just bland and boring, it doesn't make me feel like I gotta go back here for another burger. However, their sweet potato fries are absolutely delicious, they have the right amount of sugar and have a very nice crunchy texture."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Service is fast and friendly. Burgers so juicy you really need a bib!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location since before it was American Burger. We like the concept which American Burger kept as its predecessor (i.e. free ice cream with kid's meals). We love the food here...the burgers, chicken breast sandwiches and fries have always been on point. We went this past weekend and can we say you guys have taken it to the next level! My husband and I both noted how much tastier our food was. The charbroiled hamburgers and chicken breast were just a bump up on the yum scale! We enjoyed our food so much and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"So they've changed their business name to who knows what, american something?!?!?! Regardless it's still the same BT'S menu or least for now it is LOL. The burgers are AMAZINGGGGG here!!! I love this place when I'm craving for a nice juicy burger. I hope with the new name on the door, it doesn't affect their menu or quality in the near future."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. It has a great environment and overall I loved being there. I would definitely recommend it to anybody in the area. You have to try the burger (obviously) and their loaded cheese fries were an excellent appetizer. It was my first time visiting, but it definitely will not be my last time."}
{"text":"I use to make American Burger in Steele Creek our family restaurant. I LOVE the sweet potato fries and honey butter sauce. This was my top favorite places to get a burger until recently when they changed to a charcoal grill and now the burgers taste like burnt charcoal. Cannot taste the awesome flavors like before. So disappointed that we must find a new burger place!"}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get. Tried $5 Tuesdays and that's deceiving. It's a burger with your choice of 5 toppings but that's pretty much for condiment toppings. Cheeses are .80 each and toppings like bacon, chilli, egg are a $1 more per topping. Fries are ehhhh."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the very first time. I was impressed by the taste, look and feel of the place. I'm willing to return for a second time."}
{"text":"I'm really sad because I had high hopes for this place the two times I went. I went when they were bt's and now as American burger. They are the same and sadly I still waited 20 mins for a carry out order. I just don't understand. I really wish they could improve on the timeliness. It could be a great place."}
{"text":"I have to give kudos to Rob, the Manager at AB Steele Creek.  He went above and beyond to satisfy his customers.  We tipped the clock a  tad when we walked in, however, there was a large party still enjoying dinner.  A few employees said it was after nine, but Rob said the grill was still open and what would a few more burgers hurt to make.  We were  impressed at his enthusiasm and grateful that he takes customer service seriously.  More restaurant Managers should be like him and the food is always good.  We will definitely be back.  Andrew needs a little recognition also for being pleasant and showing an \"I don't mind\" demeanor.  It pays to have great customer service.  Andrew my want to teach a few others to smile and be pleasant, jobs are hard to come by these days, appreciation goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, good food. Love the outdoor seating on summer nights. The sweet potato fries are great. Right across from an ice cream shop, so it's great to get dinner here then go for ice cream. Located in the great little area of rivergate."}
{"text":"Hit or miss... it's rare they get our burger orders right. We've not gone now in quite a while after giving it more than 3 chances. If you're hungry, I suppose it will work. Otherwise, Five Guys across the street is better."}
{"text":"First let me say this was not bad. Burgers were ok. Fries were ok. Drinks were ok. There was nothing bad about the place. And that was the problem. I've had burgers just as good as non-burger places. And considering they are the self-proclaimed \"American\" burger company, I might have had my expectations set too high."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday and they were not very busy. Nevertheless, I waited 45 minutes for my food, which was never delivered. I asked for my money back and the manager agreed to refubd HALF! Out of a  $17.86 check, they refunded $8.65. Never got the food. I am never going and I recommend you avoid this place. Much better food for less nearby."}
{"text":"Issa no for me! Only good thing that came out of this is i received 10% off of my meal due to me checking in thru the yelp app. I ordered the loaded turkey burger the young girl at the register gassed me up to order this particular burger she sold me on how great it was,well i beg to differ. The burger lacked taste and the texture of the actual burger was not the best i felt like i was chewing on a big glob of bubble gum that was taking me for ever to chew.Customer service here is awesome i just wish i loved their burgers as well."}
