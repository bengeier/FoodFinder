{"text":"The perfect neighborhood joint. Fresh food, fast service, generous portions and a lovely setting. This place rivals all the Danforth Greek spots including Astoria. The salads are crunchy fresh, the gyros juicy and flavorful, and their potatoes so tasty. Free honey cinnamon pita sticks for everyone, too! Hope this place stays here forever."}
{"text":"Went here with the family. Pork was juicy and flavourful.  Enjoyed the Greek salad also."}
{"text":"Great place. My wife and I went there today for the first time for dinner. The food was really good and very generous proportions for the price (we each had the lamb souvlaki dinner). We couldn't finish it all. Fast and courteous service. Will be coming back in the near future! Will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The salad that comes with the dishes are huge! Also the lamp chops and fresh taziki and rice were all excellent. The feel is a little mom and shop type, but really authentic."}
{"text":"Had the Greek bruschetta, grilled vegetables, Greek salad, and roasted potatoes. While everything was tasty, we found the food to be very oily. There was a puddle of oil in every dish. If the items had less oil, I would eat here more often. Service is kind of inconsistent. Came here a couple of days prior ordering the same dishes with one other diner. They brought us pita bread in a basket and honeyed pita as complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. Second visit only days apart and didn't get either items, even though we ordered the same food."}
{"text":"Fantastic greek food with great service. I'm not sure if souvlaki hut is a franchise, but I was skeptical of yet another Greek restaurant on the south kingsway. I was blown away today with what was one of the best Greek meals I've ever had.... including the meals I had over 3 weeks while traveling in Greece.  The tzatziki, while not completely traditional, is thick yet fresh and light. The chicken souvlaki is incredible, tender, moist and delicious, perfectly herbed and seasoned. The pork was even better, ever so slightly pink and very moist.   Pitas a lightly toasted and crispy, phenomenal. I opted for the \"Americana Greek\" salad, bypassing the village salad and it's was fantastic, with fresh crisp veg and dressed lightly.  The display case has racks of freshly baked pastry desserts, baklava is really good.  No need to go to the Danforth anymore. I hope they keep up the quality and this place is going to thrive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a relaxed late lunch with my mom this past weekend. Love the interior with pretty blue plates and live plants adoring the walls.  We ordered a saganaki (aka flaming cheese - if you haven't tried this yet, GET IT!) to share, my mom ordered a large Greek salad with pork souvlaki and I opted for the chicken soup and small Greek salad.  Dressing tasted homemade (lovely light and tangy), salad was fresh and soup was delicious, warm and comforting.  Insider tip : you may or may not be served amazing honey sticks (aka fried bread/pita doused in Greek honey and cinnamon - YUM) at the end of you meal ;)  Would return again!"}
{"text":"We came for my mother in law's 66th birthday and they forgot to put in her order! Also missed my husband's. Terrible service. Food (what we received) your typical fast food Greek, but more expensive."}
{"text":"This was my first experience. Restaurant looks very cozy. I ordered chicken souvlaki dinner. I really enjoyed my salad. Dinner was nice but I had better !!! I recommend this restaurant. I would like to try different meals from the menu next time."}
{"text":"Great find! Good menu, great food Shrimp Santorini, large tasty shrimps enough for a meal and it's a hot appetizer. Great service, big portions will be back."}
