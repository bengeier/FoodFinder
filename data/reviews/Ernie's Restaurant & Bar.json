{"text":"I gave five stars because Ernie's delivers exactly the experience you'd expect - a divey bar with a great atmosphere and an approachable crowd. I'm new to the area so making friends is always nice. Ernie's attracts some down to earth people from all walks of life.

The staff is super friendly, though my husband didn't care for the karaoke DJ, said he was rude. Harold was our main bartender last night and was great to chit chat us up. Service wasn't horrible once the place got busy, but it looked they could have used another set of hands.

Excited to try the crab cakes! TBC..."}
{"text":"I went here for a late Sunday Lunch - what a cool funky place. The food was amazing and the waitress was good.  The waitress said the crab cake was really good - wished I would have tried that also but picked the Reuben Sandwich with Fries (Yummy). My friend had the shrimp salad which was very tasty - a bit of sweet with a spicy kick. I would have given it a 5 star but the cook was a bit slow (or maybe I was just super hungry?). Can't wait to go back and play some pool and shuffle board games there and not to mention have some food and cocktails!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Nice friendly staff. Food was hot! I had fish and chips. Food was great. Sorry to see all of the negative comments."}
{"text":"I love the layout and ambiance of this place. The \"outdoor\" bar is very cool with pool tables, darts and t.v.'s. Inside it seems a little outdated, but comfy. The food is good and the crowds are fun. Karaoke night here is the best entertainment around."}
{"text":"Where I live there is only two places that specialize in seafood close by. I've grown tired of Red Lobster so I was looking for someplace else. Ernies had opened up right under my nose so I had to try it. The wife and I went on a Friday evening getting there around 5:15 and got a table right away. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. We both tried the clam chower and it is really good. A cup of the chowder was a filling appetizer. I had the the sampler platter which was large. My wife tried the steamed shrimp and cod platter. Neither of us could eat more than half of our meal. Ernie's is a very good value for the money. We ordered dessert to go and tried the in house freshly made apple struedel. It was very good. Not too sweet and very flavorfull. We plan on returning to try more of Ernie's fare."}
{"text":"This place is awful! Went in first time. The bartenders YELL at you and act like you are on their watch. When the customer is in the restaurant they should be treated well, they keep you open. Food was bad, ordered couple apps like wings. The crowd is very rowdy and not behaved. Not a safe place to be in my opinion. Wouldn't be suprised if fights broke out daily here. Sleeze dive"}
{"text":"By far the best Karaoke bar in Scottsdale...or any place I've found in the Valley! So many great singers...it hardly feels like Karaoke, more like a live concert! They rock 60's, 70's, 80's rock, country, pop, R & B, classics, you name it!!!

They do it 7 days a week, but Friday & Saturday nights are a blast for sure. The crowd is super into it, very positive, big support, background vocals, dancing ...so much fun! 

Check it out. If you love Karaoke, you will absolutely LOVE Ernie's!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Ernie's not knowing what type of place it was but was thrilled to learn upon walking in that it was a seafood place. We love seafood!  Our waitress was awful. She acted like we were bugging her for actually coming in. Her name was Elyse?? (spelling) She left us with our menues for 20 minutes then came back and said we have a kids menu do you want to see it? Well by that time our 8 year old was ready to eat the table we were so hungry. The food came out cold because our waitress was too busy watching \"Pretty Little Liars\" on the tv right behind us and rolling silverware. Our food was awful. No one likes cold fries or seafood. But we couldn't tell her because she never came back to the table after serving us food and condiments. When she dropped of our check I asked for a to-go soda and she said \"I guess I can go find one\"  I chalked it up to her missing her show and not being happy about it. we paid $50 for our cold meal and never even got so much as a thanks for coming in, have a great day, goodbye...nothing. She left the check and that was it. We will NEVER return to Ernie's and we will absolutely pass the word on!!!"}
{"text":"I recently seen an add about Ernie's being a Maryland style seafood house, and being from Maryland I had to test it out. I ordered the Crab Cake Platter, which included 1 large crab cake, about 7 or 8 steamed shrimp (seasoned with Old Bay!) and a cup of MD style crab soup. Man, did I feel like home. The Maryland style crab soup was very tastey and had shreaded crab meat throughout, very thick and full of flavor. I'd give it a 8 out of ten, more backfin meat and it would have been a 10. The crab cake was large and no filler was in sight. It was seasoned just right and was one of the best I've had outside Baltimore. It was crispy on the outside and hunks of backfin on the inside. They do a very good job. The shrimp were a little over cooked and covered with a weird sauted Old Bay onion mix. At first I was not sure about the combination but it worked. 

Overall, I was very impressed with the Maryland style food. The only thing that need to be fixed is the strange paintings on the walls. The room has a sports / crabhouse feel but the animal paintings on the walls just doesn't go."}
{"text":"Maryland style seafood.  While I'm very well versed with seafood I'm not an expert on east coast seafood (I generally don't care for it) so I can't speak to how authentic it is.  That being said, I have enjoyed the dishes I've had here (the crab cakes, and shrimp).  This site was previously a Jilly's (sport bar & grill) and they've kept all the TV sets and bar area so its a good place to come and watch sports, or anything really since the booths have individual speakers.

*serves coke products"}
{"text":"I was here for karaoke on a Friday night. What fun we had! The DJ named Dwayne mixed music really well and can sing himself.  He makes everyone sound great. The food was surprisingly good with tons of seafood options.  It's my new favorite hangout."}
{"text":"Based on prior reviews, I decided to give this place a shot and host my wife's birthday at Ernie's. Such an awesome experience! The food was amazing (I highly recommend the steamed shrimp as well as the crab cakes), the staff was very accommodating, the karaoke was a blast, and the overall vibe was fun and laid back. I would highly recommend checking Ernie's out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now searching for a taste of home (Maryland) and will say that the food is what will keep me coming back.  From the exterior it looks like you've been sucked into a time warp circa mid 1980's and once you're inside you will see the same.  Ernie's opened in 1986 according to the menu and I'm not sure anything has changed over the years except for newer tvs and neon lights.  The service was adequate at best.  Clearly they have a regular clientele that keeps them in business and the Live Karaoke is what they come for on Friday nights.  That being said I came for the crab cakes and they didn't dissapoint.  Spot on with the right amount of lump meat and very little filler.  Served with nothing on bun, just like they should be.  Also tried the wings and steamed shrimp.  The wings come in a variety of sauces but I ordered them \"Maryland Style\" which means they were dry with Old Bay seasoning on them.  PERFECT!  The steamed shrimp are tossed in Old Bay and were great too.

Will I come back?  Sure, but only for the food.  The chef clearly knows what he's doing even if the staff seems a bit lost at times and more interested in chatting with their favorite regular at the bar.

New bartender, \"Bubbles\" I believe was her name, is not someone you'd want your teenage boys to meet although they probably wouldn't mind if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Unwind here. any day. $3 domestics $4 wells. Apps and sports on the tube. North Scottsdale can you hear me. 2pm to 7pm DAILY"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time. The name gives no indication of the food or atmosphere and the theme is inconsistent. Is it a seafood place, a bar and grill, a sports bar?

 I was surprised it was so empty on a football Sunday. Made sense after I saw the television set up--not great. Loads of tvs but they are small and arranged to each table eliminating any group or crowd interaction. 

The hostesses...abrupt in attitude and clueless regarding guests wanting to be able to watch the game.

The service...slow, inattentive and impersonal.

The food...took forever for basic items, not a lot of food for the cost, tasted acceptable.

I won't go back."}
{"text":"Based solely on the food we had for party of 7,  had to give 3 stars. Beef nachos looked good, but VERY bland. 2 people did like the wings quite a bit, and people who ordered the seafood basket thought it was way overpriced for what they received. Waitress was great with her service; however got all the drinks mixed up on our tickets. Karaoke was fun to watch!"}
{"text":"The night is young and filled with anticipation, a door swung open wide to possibility: anything at all might happen. Ernie's is a yawning invitation, the stale breath of an aged community member beckoning indelicately to oblivious passersby.

Stepping through the side door, brick archways hang low and heavy, welcoming in their shape but oppressive in their stature. Looking up, a slatted roof offers miserly strips of light, hints of sky. Still, the sense of this interior signals thoughts of musk and fog and old, damp wood.

The air is like an alcoholic smoker's breath: sweet with whiskey remnants and the sticky weight of smoke. You struggle to complete your initial breath, choose to suck short gasps in through the mouth 'til you adjust.

The bar is scant with an unimpressive total of 6 taps. You lean into a spot beside a glassy-eyed patron, signal to the barman with a nod. A cigarette sputters ash and wheezes thick lethargic smoke just near your elbow to the right.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

I believe my first thought upon entering was, \"Umm... ew.\" But what was I expecting? Truth be told, Ernie's is everything you'd expect of a local dive bar. You've got the oppressive interior elements of heavy-handed architecture, low lighting, a smoke-infested fog that you could cut through with a knife.

Two pool tables and a jukebox stand as prominent features, second only to the large brick archway windows opened bluntly to the street. For $1.00 you can play a game of pool or choose one song.

I did not even see the food menu, so can't speak to that. The drink menu, on the other hand, I can say: leaves much to be desired. Come here if you want a cheap well drink or a typical draft beer. This is not your spot for \"craft\"; it's your spot to \"keep 'em comin'\" with the regulars who regularly do.

SERVICE

The service is what wins this place its points. Despite the gloomy setting, every person that I interacted with was eager and attentive to my needs.

CONCLUSION

This was my first time at Ernie's. While I've passed it dozens and dozens of times, I've never felt the draw. With Fate Brewing Company so close by (next door!), it seems superfluous to register a dive like this one. But that's the hipster in me talking, and I know it.

So when my friend recommended that we kick it here for a while, I was wiling to oblige. And to be honest - we actually had a really nice time. Granted, that was due more to the company than to the overall environment, but we played a few games of pool, had a couple drinks and left with smiles.

I wouldn't personally go out of my way to visit Ernie's again. It's simply not my speed. This, however, should not dissuade you from swinging by. My reading of the business is entirely subjective and, from what I've seen in other reviews, the food may even be the fundamental draw. Who knows? Maybe someday me and this friend of mine will saunter back in and give that bit a whirl.

A NOTE TO THE STAFF

Ernie's Team - you're actually doing a spectacular job. Thank you for taking good care of me and my friend, and keep up the good work! You deserve the fattest tips.  :)"}
{"text":"My disclaimer - I went on a Wednesday night for the Karaoke competition (it was the finale); I had no food, but I did have beverage service, so I can't rate their food.  Our server was great!  He was quick, nice, comical, etc.  The ambiance was OK, too - lots of people and lots of energy.  Now to the bad points, which really only reflect on the proprieter.  The Karaoke DJ gal (Emma) was super loud and completely obonoxious (and gross - vulgar, I mean, in a-\"hello? I'm eating here, can you not say those things!\"-kind-of-way...eventhough I was not eating.. but everyone around me was).  I am not exagerrating, but my ears were ringing at the end of the night - I should have brought my earplugs (Jenni L!, I totally hear you on that you should carry earplugs in your purse).. I felt like I was competing with Emma or the loud microphone the whole time to talk to my hubby sitting right next to me.  I also thought it was completely rigged that the owner's daughter won the Karaoke competition (and thus a few hundred bucks.. WTcrap is that about??).  Because of those things, I probably would not go back on a Wed... and probably not any other time - besides the server, nothing seemed memorable."}
{"text":"As someone from Baltimore Maryland I was happy I looked forward to crab season because no matter how large the order or how many times I went in a week if I wanted crabs I got crabs this place will be missed. I guess its back to getting my live crabs shipped from Baltimore !"}
{"text":"Best karaoke in the valley by far, cheap drinks, non-pretentious dive atmosphere, and surprisingly good bar food (well, for the most part - skip the salads). Service can be a bit spastic sometimes, but is generally well humored and nice. They do karaoke every night at 9pm, earlier in the week for those evenings when you just want to sing and try out new stuff. Friday and Saturday karaoke gets down to business though so if you want to sing, get there early."}
{"text":"In case you haven't already heard...Ernie's Inn serves authentic Maryland-style blue crabs (while in season and by special order) and crab cakes!!  If you're from the East Coast, or a seafood fan, need I say more?!

I don't go to Ernie's very often, but when I do, it's for the blue crabs, the shrimp, a nice selection of cold brews, and all the Old Bay I can take!  In between huge handfuls of seafood, I also noticed there are a couple of nice-sized TVs on the walls (I hear they play the NFL games on Sundays), too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!"}
{"text":"Don't use a tab. Pay cash. Manager argued I bought 5 drinks when I bought 4. Originally they tried to charge me 6. Asked my sober friend and sure enough he confirmed I only had 4. He bought the 5th one cash. Moral of the story. Pay cash or nothing."}
{"text":"Turkey Club not good...avoid. Should have gotten seafood. The turkey was Hormel quality and the sandwich just didn't work out well as it was overloaded with mayo. Cole Slaw was homemade, but tasted like it was made awhile ago with frigerator burn. Bartenders were nice, but it really is a horrible situation in that place. One side has karokee, which is painful to listen to 90% of the time and it is loud. The other side blasts the music constantly and allows smoking as well, both not good for my liking. There is no escape at Ernie's - two sides of hell. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved our first experience at Ernies. We are proud Marylanders and the crab dishes were cooked to perfection. Our bartender even made us pickle shots even though he'd never done it. They were great."}
{"text":"This place has great service, great crab cakes. Very surprised, doesn't look like a place with good food..great find!!"}
{"text":"I was out of town for a few days, and after experiencing The Grapevine,  I hit Google for a different Karaoke joint. I'm a Karaoke geek and having now been at both, Eddie's wins HANDS DOWN. 

The Good: The reviews rave about the Maryland crabcakes, so I got the platter, wish also included some spicy shrimp and onions. OMG! Amazing. Once the 4 of us finished eating (each meal was great), we hit the bar area for some singing. The KJ, Sean V (I may be wrong), was cool. There were probably about 8 singers on the Thursday night and all of them were pretty good. Fear not if you are a bad singer, though. Their sound system is GREAT. A close second to the Club Congress in Tucson. Ernie's can pop in reverb if the pitch of your voice sucks, but I don't need that  ;-) This seems to be a Karaoke joint after 8pm, with the option to drink while singing. Just the way a \"karaoke bar\" should be.  Oh, every \"new\" song I wanted to sing, they had. It isn't in the book, though, you have to ask. 

The Bad: I would have liked to see more selection of draft beers. Or, if you can only have 6, a better selection. How about some AZ micro-brews? Isn't Four Peaks \"local\"? Other than this ONE thing, I don't have another Bad to offer. 

Overall, this offers a great dinner on the front half of a great night of karaoke. After 8, It's a Karaoke place you can get some drinks at, which is way better than a drinking place drunks can try to sing at. If singing karaoke is your thing, this place is a concert and a must stop for dinner and song."}
{"text":"2.5 for the experience, .5 for the free wi-fi.

The owners of Ernie's in Scottsdale have opened up a second location.  I went online to check out the reviews for the other place, and strangely there were none. 

We were here on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty slow, maybe only one or two other tables.  The service was there, but nothing great.  Happy hour on a Saturday afternoon is usually a good thing, but I wasn't really impressed by this one.  $1 off everything except wine and a few appetizers at a special price.  Five-ish beers on tap.

As for the food, the Maryland style wings were good (Maryland style = wings with Old Bay Seasoning).  We also ordered the Crab Cake Sampler, but I'm not sure where the \"sampler\" part came in.  There were three golf ball size crab cakes and it came with cocktail and tartar sauce.  The crab cakes were great, pretty much all crab meat, no filler.  However, for $13.95, they better be! The other fried appetizers looked good.  The Chicken Sandwich and fries didn't look exciting.

Let's just say I'm not in a huge hurry to get back to Ernie's.  Then again, I don't think this location has been open very long.  Maybe I'll give them some time to settle in and then try again."}
{"text":"MY husband loves karaoke and so we often find ourselves here with friends and loved one's. The drinks are cheap, the staff is friendly and the food has gotten much better over the last couple of months. We used to just order drinks while we hung out here, but since the fall we have started trying different menu items and the  sandwiches are tastier and the crab is so much better than it used to be!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Maryland-style fresh seafood in Arizona, this is absolutely the place to go! Try the crab dip, Maryland crab soup and crab cakes. Skip the calamari, skip the crab cake sandwich (you don't want the bread- I promise) and get the crab cake entree. So yummy and exactly like they make them in Maryland. I would know. 
Prices are reasonable and atmosphere is very, very casual (think \"dive\" bar) with really good service! We were very impressed. 
Unfortunately when we were there they did not have any fresh blue crabs or oysters, so I guess we'll just have to come back! And hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I went in with my boyfriend to have a good time. We ordered cheap drinks. A round of beer and a wine was about $12. Awesome! Tasted great. We played a game of pool and it was a blast. Kind of weird that the bartender we ordered from walk past me and squeezed the small of my backed. NOT Exactly what I want to feel from a creepy man I do not know on a date. 

God forbid we play shuffle board. We got through 1/2 of a game when I was cut with a LARGE SHARD OF GLASS. The bartender that served us earlier walked by and we grabbed him. 

\"Can I have something to get this bleeding to go down?\" 

\"Yeah sure you can have this dirty rag that I've been cleaning with all night\" 

\"Thank you, I will.\" I grab it and I press down on my cuts. They continuously bleed and within minutes the rag is surprisingly bloody. It was a deep cut. 

The bartender comes out of the back room and I pull him aside and say \"hey man, this cut is deep. We can't finish our game that we paid $6 for or our beers that we paid $12 for. Any chance you could at least refund us for a game or give us a a free round of drinks?\" 

*the gods unleashed a demon* 

\"NO I CANT GIVE YOU FREE DRINKS IT IS ILLEGAL. I WAS NICE AND GAVE YOU MY RAG. THATS ALL I NEED TO DO. I AM THE HEAD MANAGER I DONT NEED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU I WAS PERFECTLY NICE.\" 

So I asked him to throw away my bloody rag. 

He refused. 

\"NO I WILL NOT TOUCH THAT RAG MAAM I ASKED YOU TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT O- BLOOD TYPE\" 

\"But I'm asking you because I can't find the trash to throw it away\" 

\" YOU ARE BEING UNRULY I WILL THROW YOU OUT OF THIS BAR *RIPS THE BEER FROM MY HANDS AND PUSHES ME OUT OF THE BAR* GET OUT\" 

Mind you, I've had one glass of wine and one beer in 4 hours. I am clearly not so intoxicated that A) I can't articulate myself as I write this yelp review..ha and B) clearly I am absurd for jokingly asking for a compensated round of drinks since I just ruined a game because I cut myself enough to be uncomfortable gripping a mere shuffle board puck. And lastly, C) God forbid I expect the manager, self described as the \"head manager\" to be able to console me after an unfortunate experience. 

He ripped my $6 drink from my hand and kicked me out. 

Will NEVER be returning. And to think that this was named Phoenix's best 50 restaurants...ha! Absurd. I immediately texted my girlfriend about he incident and she replied \"I hate ernie's. The last two times I was there I had food poisoning\". Enough said I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had my birthday here and had a BLAST! Loved the karaoke set up and the staff were awesome and really friendly"}
{"text":"So my Ernie's experience was awesome! It had all to do with the karaoke... The host was awesome and the vibe was incredible. So much fun! There was a group of us, about 15 people and she took care of all of us! If you're looking for a place to do karaoke and have a blast doing it, visit Ernie's! 

The drinks were decent too. Overall it was a pretty awesome evening! Looking forward to coming back one day and singing the night away!"}

{"text":"Ernie's is an old bar restaurant. Ernie's is owned by a family from Maryland. During the summer, they shipped in from Maryland Maryland blue crabs . If you want to get crabs you have to call on Wednesday and make a reservation otherwise they may not have any when you get here. Besides Maryland steam crabs, they have crab cakes and other Maryland items plus they have all types of food. unfortunately because of the distance we don't come here as often as I would like, but I always manage to come here on my birthday. The waitstaff is wonderful, funny, easy to talk to, and very prompt. When I come here again you bet I always come back."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and awesome service.   Love being able to sit outside during the winter."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I randomly stopped in to watch a playoff bruins game. We ordered a few drinks, watched the game and ordered some food. The buffalo chicken salad was among the best that I've had! And I am a huge buffalo *anything* fan. The staff was very attentive and the ambiance was very laid back. A great dive bar! They have pool tables as well. I will be back to try more of their tasty food!"}
{"text":"Great crab cakes!

Karaoke every night inside the bar. 

Outside bar was really loud and smoky, that could be good or bad depending on who you are. 

Walked in with a group of 6 and a large, round corner table was available (all other booths seat 4). The bartender let us know the table was \"for all of these people\"...\"these people\" he was referring to were currently taking up the 8 places at the bar at the time. 

So you reserve a large table for a group that also takes up another large area of seating? Really? 

Moral of the story, if you have a large group be sure to call ahead to reserve. You'll get half the bar."}
{"text":"If you are anywhere near N. Scottsdale Rd. and Shea Blvd. in Scottsdale, Arizona, you will be glad you gave Ernie's a try.  Moreover, if you know and love Chesapeake Blue Crab, this place knows how to serve it.  The crab cakes are sweet and perfect!  We also tried the special: prime rib sliders ... Oh .. Yes.  Many thin slices of juicy prime rib on the little slider rolls, with au jus and creamy horseradish sauce.  The margaritas were superb, as was the gin martini.  Skip the house wines ... definitely not a forte.  But this is not wine country, so that is eminently forgivable.  We will find a way to swing by here next winter. And Sue is a delight - she's been there 33 years!"}
{"text":"Great little old fashioned dive bar. Beer is cold and the drinks are served string. Surprisingly, the seafood items are the best things on the menu and what the bar is known for. The Rueben is very good as well as the French Dip. However, in all my 30+ years of eating Buffalo Wings, Earnie's are the worst I have had; I couldn't even finish my plate!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed ourselves here however, when my fiancé paid for our hefty tab, he realized he didn't have enough cash to tip as high as he normally does but still managed a over 20%. Mind you 90% of the time we made the trip to the bar to order & pick up our drinks so it was not as though we were being \"served\" at our table, but we didn't mind that at all. When my fiancé handed the bartender the money he said, \"wow, that hurts bro,\" which we thought was very rude & unprofessional. We were mostly insulted because we are always polite customers & tip high even when the service is so-so. We are laid back people & enjoyed the laid back atmosphere but rude & unprofessional should never be in the air when it comes to staff of any establishment."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The seafood the service the crab scallops crab cakes cold beer and the noise from the traffic cause the windows are all open and yes people smoke there. Been there a few times and I sent people there. They loved it the peel and eat shrimp."}
{"text":"The bar area looked like a nice, casual place to get a drink. It's open air in the bar, which is neat. The food is disgusting, though. My dad commented, \"If I had known it was going to be like that I would have gone to Long John Silver's because LJS is better!\". Fries were not bad."}
{"text":"Moving from Michigan to California was tough...now from California to Arizona a breeze with a place like Ernie's. My husband and I feel at home here. Amazing team taking care of their patrons. Always friendly and engaging. We are working on becoming regulars. Such great people from all over come here."}
{"text":"Still no door on that toilet stall in the men's room? Sorry but people do like to poop in privacy. I'd hate this to be the reason why I am down rating this bar, but you'd think it'd be more of a priority for them to fix something as simple as a bathroom stall door. If you don't want to fix this, add a lock to the main door."}
{"text":"Fun bar to go to! Karaoke was a blast and servers were great! One of the best bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood watering hole and casual dining. Fun and laid back atmosphere with friendly people. Always a great place to grab a drink or bite to eat with friends."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place.  It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  It's split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).  We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  It's casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for."}
{"text":"This is a great location, great design, good food..... BUT, karaoke on college football Saturday night and high prices...I don't know that I can go back. 

The entree was great, crab cake sliders that are perfectly prepared, not too mushy but moist and perfectly seasoned on toasted buns.
The side salad was mediocre. Why wouldn't they have a salad topped with a crab cake? I have to build my own and it costs $16.95.
The chili is really good, hubby get it every time!
Beer & wine pricey. 

I guess I have to leave you with a suggestion of calling ahead to make sure you don't run into bad singers when you want game highlights at this sports bar."}
{"text":"While the food is priced slightly higher than other restaurants in the area, Ernie's proves that you truly do get what you pay for. Their menu varies from hamburgers and other \"all-American food\" to seafood, which is definitely their forte. As of this writing I've tried roughy 1/3 of their menu, and haven't found a single item that I wouldn't give a glowing review to.

The owners and staff are not only very professional, they are also very friendly. The second time I went to Ernie's, I was greeted by no less than 3 employees who remembered me from the week before. My waitress remembered that I drank lemonade, and asked me if I wanted the crab dip again for an appetizer (I did, it's amazing). They really did make me feel at home.

Ernie's is also a great place to drink your nights away. The bartenders are hilarious and offer good drink recommendations, and the crowd that Ernie's attracts (while small for now) are mostly quality, social people. The drink prices are reasonable without having to resort to \"reverse happy hour\" gimmicks or anything silly like that.

All in all, a great place."}
{"text":"Ernies is a typical dive bar with a significant difference: their food is amazing. 

~Fud~
They specialize in East-Coast Maryland style dishes. Please come here to try these specifically, anyone who comes here really goes for that specifically. I personally have had their clam chowder, which is the best chowder I have had besides The Fish Market's and pretty much any chowder in Maryland. Drinks are plentiful, its a dive bar. No frazzy dazzy drinks, just simple bar fare. They do have drink specials, I can't name any specifically since I haven't been in a while, but they exist. The key ingredient is the food, its great guys. Stick to the East-Coast fare and you should be in heaven. I can't vouch for other options on the menu outside of the seafood.

~Atmosphere~ 
As I said, its a divey east-coast bar. They are big into karaoke. I partook in one song, and was done haha. I can' t sing. The crowd is in a constant flux. It never changes. It always seems to be a mix of displaced/new hipsters trying new bars and the older crowds...oh and some lone cougars on the prowl (roar!). The waitstaff have been here for a while and take care of their customers, but its not a \"hot-spot\". There are numerous bars out in Scottsdale to party at, this is more of a local dive to sing karaoke to and hang with friends on the weekend or after work.

~Extras/Rating~
Please do not come dressed to the gills or expect loud pumping music to dance to. Its a bar, not a nightclub. They take good care of their clientele, but just make sure to have a good responsible time. They get 3 stars for the food automatically and the service. Besides that, being a no-thrills bar they lose 2 for being a general run of the mill dive. I love this place and will need to go more... guarantee it. But I can't rate it higher than 3 stars in its current state. A solid 3-3 1/2 * rating for a great East Coast Bar. Go, you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went to have lunch here at their Chandler location and they forgot to hand us lunch menus. Then our waitress had a family emergency phone call in the middle of our service and we were passed onto someone else. Our food came out and most of it was cold. Also, they completely forgot to bring out one of my coworker's order. Our original waitress eventually returned but we went great lengths of time between refills and waiting for our bill. 

So basically, the food was average to below average and the service was definitely below average. It was enough to turn me off from the place for good."}
{"text":"The karaoke host is an ass. I tried to put in songs and each one he said it had been sung but it hadn't been. When i called him on it, he said he didn't care people had been treating him like crap. He said the customer is not always right. I don't think they are but he was an ass. Told the bartender. I never complain but he treated our party awful. He didn't like his job so he should find another"}
{"text":"The Redskins was hosting its prep rally, restaurant maxed out. Went to another bar and had a great time"}
{"text":"Went for karaoke night. I concur with a previous commenter, the KJ is an ass. He said that he didn't have songs that he deemed \"unpopular\" when every other karaoke bar that I've been to (in 3 states) has had them AND crowds of people have sung along. His attitude is awful, as he scolded me for not picking songs from the book, yet he claimed to have more songs than were in the book and patronized me for considering not asking him about those non-book songs? (Make up your mind, dude!) Also, if going deaf is your goal, then you'll love the amped up music decibels. (Of all the glorious ways to go deaf, karaoke dive bar isn't in my top favs.)

However, the bar staff was really attentive in the karaoke area...but the KJs 'tude and ambiance trumps all of that."}
{"text":"My first time there and like it a lot, went for lunch. It was a bit pricey but worth it and the beer was nice and cold. It was hot only because I sat in the patio bar but there are mister outside. I'm definitely going back and for checking out the night seen."}
{"text":"Super super delicious food at a dive bar. Surprised that there was so many options of seafood on the menu. Apparently, the owner is from Maryland and ships the crabs/crab meat from Maryland.  You must of the crab cakes as an appetizer, no fillers!  As for the calamari, it was alright. The breading was too thick and was too oily.  The environment is chill dive bar.  Some of the bartenders are snooty, liked our lady who helped us until the night bartenders came."}
{"text":"Ernie's is a fun place to goto, but it isn't my favorite place.  The bartenders are old, and everything else in the place.  But it is a fun place to go drinking if you want a dive bar with people on a thursday night."}
{"text":"Went on Friday for karaoke when I was at Cubs Spring Training. Our service left alot to be desired. First of all, the space is pretty trashy. Second, our waitress was neither attractive, nor anywhere close to friendly. She sounded like she was doing us a favor by taking our order. Granted, it was pretty crowded. 
The food: Crabcakes were very large and tasty! French fries pretty average at best. The clam chowder was also pretty good. 
The karaoke: First of all, the books were all alphabetized by song title, not artist name, which made it very difficult to locate specific songs. It was pretty packed, but we waited forever for our songs to be called and we finally got bored and left. The only plus for the karaoke was the wireless mic that allowed the singer to roam the bar. I was pretty surprised that there were so many attractive women at Ernie's Inn."}
{"text":"Bartenders here are extremely rude and disrespectful. Food has really gone down hill over the years. Thank goodness there are a couple decent  places in the plaza. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clientele. Good prices, good food, and good beer. Great atmosphere. Very large, spacious, indoor and open-air seating. Several tv's, pool tables, and shuffle board outside. Never went inside but there was karaoke and seemed like a large seating area and bar inside. An unexpected visit...wasn't planning on coming here, but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best place for karaoke hands down. The floor is large enough for dancing and the bar has a nice set up. There's pool tables on the other side if you don't want to be around karaoke. Karaoke can get busy on the weekends so you might not get that many songs in. Usually there is always a fun crowd though."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ernie's Inn, but I've heard about them for years. I'm currently a Residential Real Estate Agent that works in the East Valley and the team I'm on is a family team who are originally from Baltimore. They talk about this restaurant all the time and go as often as they can. They love it because during crab season Ernie's fly's in live Maryland-style blue crabs. They are kept alive in what I assume is an aquarium, and are only cooked when you order them. They are as fresh as you can get in land locked Arizona, and they are delicious. I recommend going with someone who knows what they are doing or studying up on how to eat Maryland blue crab, because they are messy and complicated, but totally worth it. This would not be a first date kind of place. The crabs were fresh, the french fries were crispy, and the beer was cold. It was a perfect evening."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped for a drink and appetizer. If drinking, smoking, and cussing is your kind of patio atmosphere this is your watering hole! I ordered the crabcake appetizer. Reminded me of my grandma's Thanksgiving stuffing. All I could taste was sage and the consistency was mushy. YUCK! My friend ordered the calamari. Fried coating/breading was all that could be detected. Double YUCK! I know this is Phoenix and not Maryland that is why it is getting 3 stars instead of 1 or 2."}
{"text":"1st Review from 2017(I forgot to hit 'post revVisited this place after a recommendation from someone who remembered how good the food was years ago. I must say I was a little apprehensive because there was nothing special about this place. 

Yes, I judged a book by its cover but was pleasantly surprised! 

Again, there was nothing to write home about regarding the ambiance and decor, but it was clean and had good Aura.

We sat on the Karaoke  side, which was like a whole other bar(technically, it was). There was literally only the 3 of us, the bartender who was not aware that we even came in, the Karaoke host (who had a great voice and wasn't the usual, annoying Karaoke guy) and 2 other people who seemed to disappear. 

All that aside, let's get to the food! OMG (oh my gravy)! Anytime I see crab  cakes on a menu, I order them but not before inquiring of the staff's personal opinion and experience. I forget our servers name but he was nice, knowledgeable about the menu and made good suggestions. 

We ordered the crab cake appetizer, which came with 3 crab cake spheres, peel and eat shrimp and zucchini. Amazing crab cakes! So much so, we ordered the 6oz meal which came with another 1/4lb of the shrimp. Personally, I think the appetizer price was s but strap ($13-14?) but once you take your first bite, you understand. 

The shrimp were cooked to perfection too (a bit spicy for me.

The drinks were ok.

And yes, I did karaoke  too. I did Justin Timberlake's Sexyback and that's when the party started. Seriously! The music and my inner entertainer brought a small crowd. One lady said she has been going here for years and that was the best time she has ever had during Karaoke. I had a blast. Unfortunately, a third of my company was a Debbie downer and I changed my mind about doing another song.

Final opinion, go for the food and stay for Karaoke! And make sure you let the wait staff/bartender know you're there because the Karaoke side is so dead they're busy talking to each other and \"didn't notice\" us."}
{"text":"FUCKING LOVE THIS PLACE. Seriously, if you're from MD, an east coaster or a RAVENS Fan. This is your bar. Seriously, the Maryland crab soup is stunning! I LOVE THIS BAR!"}
{"text":"Went out on a date last night and he picked the place, I like it when the man picks and plans things. He picked Ernie's, now if on my own I would have never have found this place and am happy to have gone. Once you walk in, if you look to the back you will see 2 pool tables, dart board and a shuffle board, the place itself is big and roomy, opened and inviting; I liked the brick look of the walls. There was flat screen TVs up on the walls and sporting events were playing and in the background jazz music was playing. I liked the vibe of this place. Our server was Dan, he was fast & friendly, felt sorry for him because I took forever to figure out what I wanted to ordered.  I wound up ordering the Smothered Chicken sandwich with French fries, the bread was soft the chicken tender , the peppers, onions and mushrooms so fresh and delish! Only down fall was the sandwich was little on the dry side, but I ordered a side of bbq sauce and fixed that. Man I want to try their Crab dip & Maryland Crab Cakes...but I was limiting myself on this trip, wanted to be lady like, but I don't think that worked, he ordered a salad LOL so we , I mean me , got finished with our/my dinner and Dan asked if we wanted desert, now I never order desert,,,but Dan listed off the items for desert and said they have PINEAPPLE UPSIDEDOWN CAKE!! HOLD UP!! Pineapple upside-down cake?? Oh heck yea I want that!! So I ordered the cake, and man it was moist the pineapple and brown sugar topping was so mouthwatering good, can't believe it ate it all. Ok so much for being lady like, man I ate!!  From reading other reviews here on yelp I have learned that Ernie's also has karaoke. I'm going to have to check that out. The date was great; the place was a great find for me! I will most def be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Ernie's! The only thing I don't like is one of the karaoke djs who is an absolute jerk! Otherwise I like this place for karaoke!"}
{"text":"Ernies is a blast from the past and if you like karaoke you're in for a treat. The singers sound like pros! My friend Amy said their fresh oysters are better than the Ocean Club's, clear, crisp and on point! And 1/4 of the price!"}
{"text":"The cream of crab soup is to die for.  Service is polynomial!  If in the area, you should give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Always packed. Super fun. One room is an outdoor bar. The other room is a karaoke bar. Was there for an epic birthday bash with some friends. Service was top notch and the nachos are the best!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited me to a group Karaoke at Ernie's. Ernie's is in my neighborhood and I had no idea it has 365 days year long Karaoke! The Karaoke bar is in the back of the bar, it's quite big and the DJ is great. He even played electric guitar for one of the singers which was awesome. I definitely recommend checking this bar out if you are a Karaoke fan specially since it's classy compared to other Karaoke bars I've seen so far."}
{"text":"I love this dive bar.  Here's why:

+ They have outdoor pool tables!  Yes, on the patio, you can play pool....awesome!  They also have a pool tournament on Thu nights.

+ They have a Karaoke night....no, I don't like to sing, but I love to people watch, and there's nothing better than Karaoke for people watching, ha!

+ They have Firestone IPA on tap.

+ Plenty of parking in the shopping center it's located in.

+ It has that old bar feel to it....it just feels right!

Can't wait to go back and shoot some pool!

Return Factor - 100%"}

The only downside is that one of the dj's can be a bit of a stiff if he doesn't like you. Other than that, the staff is great and the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I'm from maryland and these crab cakes don't compare to real Maryland lump crab cakes. Ernie's crab cakes are just ok. No lump crab meat, mostly filler and are more like a fritter ball."}

{"text":"Place used to be great! Now they charge resort type prices for booze with an atmosphere that is border townesque."}
{"text":"Best place ever.  If you have Alyn or Todd as your bartenders, they're beyond 5 Star service.  The entire staff is extremely polite, professional, and efficient.  Need I say more."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with what score to give this place. I'm wavering betwixt 3 and 4. I will round up like grade school.

I went here on a Friday night with some friends who wanted to drink and sing. This is not a normal Friday night, but an interesting combo. The suggestion of Ernie's was made, so, like sheep, we went. 

Now this is far from my normal scene, and at first glance, I thought I was back in the dirty South. The first section you walk into looks like bikerville. It is smokey and dirty, a stereotypical biker bar scene. Fortunately, they value customers, so they have a separate, enclosed bar that is for karaoke. No smoke. Cleaner. I'm cool with this part of the place. 

The mixed drinks were ok. The major components that made this a good experience were the wait staff and the DJ. They were both stellar. I would highly recommend this as a karaoke spot. Seriously, if you want to get drunk off your ass and sing Bohemian Rhapsody or some Sinatra tune, this is the place in Scottsdale to do it. So go get your e-oke on, yo."}
{"text":"Highly reccomend the Steamed Shrimp! They are big and juicy covered in spices! Excellent service and good atmosphere with kareoke inside!!"}
{"text":"I am shocked at the good reviews for this place.  Don't....do.....it....

We went on St. Patrick's day to watch some games, drink some beer and get a bite to eat.  We were immediately seated by a friendly hostess.  We ordered drinks and looked over the menu.  I ordered the Nitro Milk Stout that was advertised all over the walls.  Good choice.  It was a great bottled beer.  There are also TVs everywhere.  Since it's the middle of March Madness - this was also good.  But our waitress had NO personality whatsoever.  She was hesitant to answer basic questions like \"What's on Happy Hour?\"  Mumble mumble...no smile.....  Ok - we're on our own here...

Now down to the food.

It's a sports-bar kind of place so I expected bar food.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries in an attempt to be safe.  It was not.  The hamburger was not terrible but the fries were cold, stale and dry.  Thank goodness the beer was good.  So I ordered several to wash down the food.  This actually turned out to be a good idea because a much more friendly gal (beer promoter) ended up noticing and giving me both a free beer and a t-shirt after chastising me for not drinking this beer the \"proper\" way by slamming it into a glass.  Heaven forbid I continue drinking it straight out of the bottle thereby ruining the Left Hand Brewing Co's marketing trick of putting gas in the bottle itself to give the waterfall effect that usually only draft beers can give you.

All in all, the lackadaisical service from our waitress coupled with the yucky food means I won't be coming back.  I can buy expensive (but delicious) beer somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ah, Ernie's. The archetypal biker bar frequented by a clash of cultures. I've noticed business types guzzling beers after work, pool hounds and women that look like they belong in a Scottsdale club.

So, needless to say, it's a breathe of fresh air compared to Scottsdale bars in the vicinity (just avoid the smoking patio).

I guess I can't review the food without admitting I've never had it. But I've heard it's worthy (seafood and crab cakes mainly, and as a Marylander, I think I could be a good taste test).

Drink prices are decent, but there is no happy hour (if I'm wrong, let me know. Each time I've asked the bartender said no). Of the five or six times I've been there, the bartender said barely a word - a disappointment but not a dealbreaker.

Karaoke is a blast and come 1 a.m., it's easy to meet friends at Ernie's.

Just keep a designated driver nearby :-)"}
{"text":"Always a great time at Ernie's !!  I love the intimate atmosphere.  It's not frilly or pretentious, just a great place to meet up with friends & make new ones.  

I think the karaoke starts at 8p.m. (not sure on daily schedule).  It is tons of fun to listen and watch.  There are some awesome singers there sometimes and sometimes it's just awesome to witness the singers who don't really care but are there to have fun.  

The drink prices are not expensive.  They have great food too.  

Enjoy!  It's a Scottsdale landmark."}
{"text":"Omg! Love this place! The bartenders are super good looking and so nice! I just feel like im in heaven when im here. The beer is always ice cold and the wings are delicious. Harold and Matt are the best! Go in and ask for them. They will take care of you. Definitely my new favorite place."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Maryland in several years and I'm always wary of any crabcake recommendations outside of Baltimore as they have been wrong a complete and utterly disappointing 100% of the time. However, Yelp's users have not let me down in the past and I stumbled upon the reviews for Ernie's purely by accident. The descriptions of the seafood had a pretty authentic-sounding familiarity to them, so I gave in and decided to give this place a try, and woah, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.

I ordered a plate that included both a crabcake and some shrimp, just in case the crabcake was inedible, that way I would have something to fall back on. The plate came with a choice of starch with soup or salad to start. As much as I love-love-love crab soup, I hadn't had a fresh vegetable in two or three days so I opted for the salad. When the salad came to the table I knew I was in the right place. It was lettuce (of course) topped with croutons, tomato, and cucumber. The one thing that convinced me that this place is authentic? A sprinkling of black olives over the salad. NO ONE outside of Baltimore does this! At that moment I knew I was going to be able to eat my dinner. When my actual food came the crab cake had thick lumps of crab held together with just the perfect amount of seasoned bread/egg mixture. I loved every bite of it. My personal taste dictates a much heavier dose of Old Bay, however, my steamed shrimp came with more than a liberal distribution of my favorite seasoning. Easy fix: I mixed a little of the extra that was on the shrimp, which were meaty and abundant, with every bite of the best crabcake outside of Baltimore. 
After dinner, I signed up for the email list for steamed crabs. I even called my parents in California and told them where I was taking them for dinner the next time they come visit."}
{"text":"Maryland Crab Cake. 

Oh, and the fried zucchini is pretty good, although I prefer sticks, it's cut in disks and the breading is quite tasty. French fries are nice and crispy, too. Ambience isn't quite like the other location - this one has more trendy decor. But who cares because the food is the same and they have the same fantastic MARYLAND. CRAB. CAKES.

~drool~"}
{"text":"Ernie's is def one of the better dive bars I have been to in Scottsdale - bartenders were super friendly, the have tons of fried greasy food to soak up your booze when you've been busy drinking and working up an appetite singing karaoke. The crowd is super fun and friendly and drink prices are cheap!"}
{"text":"Do not go food uncooked, waitress was great, manager informed me I had no taste.  DO NOT GO waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I love this place but there was a bartender that I've not seen before last night and when I ordered my drink, vodka soda, he accidentally put coke in it and didn't say anything and I watched him do it  it was funny so it's fine, but next time maybe say something, especially if I saw you do it."}
{"text":"My new favorite Karoake location. Emma the KDJ is awesome and the equipment is super! And the people who frequent the place seem serious about music and having a good time.

Don't ask me about the food. I only consumed music and liquid happiness . It may have influenced my judgement and maybe I am hence not qualified to really give an opinion.  But I I'm wrong about the Karaoke, what's the worse that could happen? You could go and being your own joyful spirit and rock it out the way you like it!

But I really enjoyed the tunes!"}
{"text":"We ventured out here and had the BEST time.  This is a dive bar that is full of colorful locals. No tourists. Sweet!

Not wanting to set foot in Old Town or any resorts on NYE, a friend suggested we all head up here for a low key and fun NEW away from tourists, massive cover charges and the need to deal with crowds.

Best. Idea.Ever.

We had a group of about 14-15 and got a reserved spot right in the karoke room.  The menu is heavy with seafood, and as a longtime Southeastern coast resident, I'm a bit snotty about seafood in the desert. NO way.  So I opted for the fajitas. Delicious!!!  

Everyone else loved their selections as well.  

OUr waitress dealt with our large group in a courteous manner and even offered to keep separate checks for all of us. What?!  The drinks are cheap as hell.

Karaoke is off the chain. Now, the people that come here to sing are here to SANG!  It's a bit intimidating as it appears that everyone is there to be 'discovered'.  We  ended up taking turns singing our way (i.e. badly) and had a GREAT time.

This is a local, no frills dive bar with great food, cheap drinks and first class entertainment. Good times."}
{"text":"We had never been there before, but saw the street sign promoting their fresh crabs.   We ordered the crabs and the seafood basket (each @ $14,95) at around 2 pm.

Both were just alright in taste- too much breading, the potato salad was bland and overall experience less than expected.   It might be a fun sports bar watching a game but we do not recommend this as a restaurant.

FYI- the service was pleasant from the bartender (only one on duty to cover 3 areas), but the rest rooms were not clean."}
{"text":"Coworker: Ernie's has the best crab cakes in town!
Natalie G: Don't be ridiculous. They're a dive bar. They have karaoke. 
C: No, they're known for their crab cakes. 
NG: No. They're known for their patio and karaoke. 

I'm here to publicly apologize to my coworker. 

Those crab cakes.... SO much crab. Just enough filler to keep it together and enough crumbs on the outside to give it texture. So freaking tasty. Crab cake perfection. I'd give five stars simply for the crab cake and the clam chowder.

Nachos appetizer were tasty with quality chips and cheese. The spinach artichoke dip was meh, but fine. The Maryland style wings were actually really tasty (a bit salty) and very meaty. Would have been perfect with a pitcher of beer. 

We were a fairly large party for a weekday lunch and Ernie's only has one bartender working both inside and outside, so we didn't expect super quick service but our full lunch took about two hours with appetizers and entrees, so just keep that in mind if that's the time you're planning on hitting them up. Our girl kept it real with us while still being upbeat. I liked that. 

p.s. Don't get the mashed potatoes. Trust."}
{"text":"What a trip! It's like a movie set, just brings you back to the 90's. It's like I've been here in the past... ANYWAY, if you're in Phoenix with a few friends you have to check out Ernie's. It's just weird fun and huge. This place has a very unique layout with arches, indoor outdoor areas, patios, secret entrances. It's a very unique establishment. To some it may be a regular bar, but to me it's worth a visit just because when you're there you know you're in Phoenix no doubt. 

While I was making my way to the bathroom I saw people eating a wide variety of food from generic bar food wings fries burgers to crabs and other seafood, which is strange considering there's no ocean nearby. Like I said, kind of a strange place but fun and wacky where anything goes. There are tons of screens to watch games, and they have a kareoke area where you'll definitely see people letting loose. There's also a shuffle board outside, and lots of other quiet areas to sit and drink. It feels like someone's home more than a bar. 

Ernie's is a super casual place, but I was very surprised to see fairly decadent costumes inside. There's a very nice diversity in the crowd and everyone seems to be in their own zone."}
{"text":"Fantastic crab and shrimp, best happy hour you can get. They let you sample the beer on tap before you drink it. I love how the bar is open like on the outside but it's really on the inside without windows. I would invite everyone here"}
{"text":"Seafood in the desert is always a challenge. Earnie's is not the place to get it. I was excited to see the menu of seafood and try it out and did the other day. The joint is located at what once was a Jilly's location. They haven't changed one thing outside of the signage either. We got sat in a corner booth and I immediately noticed the dirty table. The salt shaker was completely slathered with grease from a prior patron - half filled too. 

Sat down and waited for service..and waited...and waited. Christ the place is empty, why such slow service? Literally was a ghost town. No abckground music made sitting there a bit uncomfortable, a TV had sound in the background - what an ambiance killer.  

Eventually the manager came over and waited on us the entire time. That said, the service was abysmal.  First two appetizers I ordered they were out of - not a good sign. Asked for a wine list and I quote, \"We don't have one. We have a red and a white.\" After ordering, he never took the menus away and they sat there until end of meal, never cleared app plates, failed to ask for follow up drinks, forgot to deliver 2 ordered food menu items. 

The \"White Wine\" was horrible. We ordered the crab cake sampler and they weren't \"cakes\" at all but rather three small cake balls - disappointing. Peel and eat shrimp were OK but was served with onions and the onions were so friggin' salty it was crazy. My friend had the fried scallops which was a good portion and he said tasted good. I had soft shell crabs that were not good at all.  

Bad ambiance, poor service, meh on the food - a negative trifecta."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall Karaoke joint in Phoenix.  Listening to 2.1 surround sound speakers Macintosh from 1998!"}
{"text":"Old school bar.  Enough said. Character abound and good music    Probably the best place to wind down at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Great dive! The singers were extraordinary - there was some really talented singers there (and they were very nice and supportive of the lesser folk like me). 

The bartender made a great vodka soda and was very helpful when I had some unwanted attention. I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm in town.

Update: I liked this bar so much, I went back 2 more times on my visit to Scottsdale.  The prices were just right ($5 Vodka soda) and the bartenders were attentive, even on a busy night.

What really brought be back was the awesome entertainment. The karaoke host was easy to approach, had a huge assortment of music, had a great voice himself and seems to be an all-around fantastic human being -- probably the reason there are so many regulars! Great place - I'll be sure to return every time I am in town."}
{"text":"The crab cakes are the best outside of Maryland!!!

They are all crab, real blue crab, not that stuff spelled with a \"k\". And there's no filler either. They also have great crab soup and crab dip. The sliders were excellent as well.

Every time I visit the Phoenix area, this is one of my stops. It might not be the fanciest of places, but you will get some of the best food and some of the coldest beer I have found in AZ. The people working there are some of the nicest around.   

Also, I love that the woman behind the bar calls me \"Hun\"... Makes me miss the east coast....

Oh yeah, if you like whole blue crab, you can get on their email list, they let you know when they get them in fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for Happy Hour and really wanted to try their crab cakes that everyone is raving about. The crab cakes were fantastic, very little filler and nice pieces of lump crab in them. Also had the peel n eat shrimp. The shrimp were very fresh and they had a light coating of seasoning. Could've easily ate a pound of them, they were REALLY tasty.
Only negative was the smokers that sit in the \"open\" bar area. Would've liked to sit out there but no way I can handle the smoke. The bartender took great care of us and was very pleasant and attentive. Will definitely be back again. Never dreamt a bar like Ernie's could have such delicious seafood. They should advertise their menu more. They do have quite a following and are almost always busy when we pass by."}
{"text":"Great shrimp makes me miss living in Virginia! Drinks are poured very well. Looks like a hole in the wall but its a really fun place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with a great dining experience, sports bar and entertainment"}
{"text":"Yes, the crab cakes are very good!  If you like the crappy deep fried breaded ones so many restaurants pass off as crab cakes, then you will be disappointed.  

We are new to the city, and disappointed with the beer selection we have seen at many places.  No difference here.  No porter, no stout.  It does remind us of a dive bar.  All windows were open and for some reason a ceiling fan next to the bar was on high creating a terrible breeze, on a cool night.  

The scallops were frozen breaded junk, so disappointing with a place that serves such great fresh crab cakes.  The steamed shrimp had a spice on it, but it was okay with me, though don't know if I could have eaten more than the quarter-pound supplied with my dinner.  

Not sure about the other menu items, but I know we will come back for the excellent crab cakes again!  Also, not sure if it is a full bar or not.  They had dixie cups over every liquor bottle behind the bar."}
{"text":"I had the crab dip during happy hour and it was decent. The happy hour price was pretty good, but I actually went for karaoke. There weren't a lot of people at karaoke, so I was kind of bummed. I think they should advertise for the karaoke a little bit more to get more people going!"}
{"text":"First a little about me - I am not a loud person, nor have I ever been disciplined, kicked out of or otherwise asked to leave any establishment. I would prefer a quiet bar where I can converse with my friends over a club any day. 

Now about my experience at Ernie's - I came to support a friend who was participating in a karaoke contest on a Tuesday night. About 20 minutes into said competition, the female \"judge\" made a point to shame myself and the people I was sitting with for laughing (quietly and amongst ourselves, not at any participant), said it was \"distracting\" to her and made a comment about waiting to \"have fun later\". Wow. I had no idea that talking and laughing amongst friends at a dive bar was something to be publicly scolded for. Now so you don't think that I'm just overly upset from a personal, one-off situation - Several other times throughout the evening, this karaoke staff made a point to get on the mics and tell the patrons of the bar to be quiet, and at one point the man acting as the DJ even told everyone in the bar to \"shut the hell up\". Mind you, NO ONE was talking above normal bar chatter. Not a single person that night had been overly loud, or rude, or obnoxious or harassing, which are the only situations I can appropriately deem to speak up and say something. 

I have to assume that the entire reason that this karaoke contest exists is to get more people to come into Ernie's and drive business. So then, why is the staff then acting like these very patrons are unruly children who need to be disciplined and scolded? This was an awful experience and I don't foresee ever coming back."}
{"text":"Nachos were excellent. Chicken wings were good too! We went in the middle of the day when there were only three other people there. Nice little place"}
{"text":"Great food and pleasant atmosphere! Best food in Scottsdale, would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ernies about once a week for the past month and a half. I mainly go for the Karaoke, food and atmosphere. The sound system here for karaoke is the best in the Valley and the DJ is great. There are multiple tv's displaying the lyrics as you sing. There are also some regulars in here that sing amazingly like professionals. I'm just a novice and do it for fun but everyone is supportive.

I LOVE the food here, it's fresh, doesn't taste like it came out of a box or frozen. Ernies always have food specials for around $10 - $13 written on the chalkboard as you walk in the front door. 
I've had the seafood sampler twice, and it's delicious, it includes, shrimp, clams, and mussels in a yummy seasoned broth with onions and it comes with toasted baguette to soak up the juices. 
Another option is the 1/2 lb. or 1 lb. steamed shrimp. It's ALOT of shrimp, but you will not regret it, it's seasoned to perfection, a lil spicy and so good.
 I've also tried the shrimp stuffed crab which came with fries and cocktail sauce. That was delicious but unfortunately the last time I went there the waiter didn't know what I was talking about when I asked for it. My date was very dissapointed about that as he'd tried it before with me and fell in love with that particular meal.
 I also went there on St. Patricks Day and ate the corned beef and cabbage, which was to. DIE. for. , the owner brought me out some horseraddish and told me to try that with it and I almost creamed my pants it was sooo good.

Regular Happy hour is from 2pm - 7pm includes discount on food and drinks.
Reverse Happy hour is from 10pm - Midnight and includes $1 off all drinks.
I like that you don't have to wait for your drinks, the bartenders are friendly and very prompt. No waiting for 5 - 10 minutes like has happened at some other bars I've gone to in the Valley (i.e. george and dragon). I usually order a tequila sunrise and the bartender remembers my drink when i arrive, but on st. patricks day they got me addicted to something called a \"Nutty Irishman\". My friend usually orders the KiltLifter on tap.

There is an outdoor bar and patio as well for those who want a smoke. It includes a big screen tv.

The crowd there is touch and go. There are a few regulars, and sometimes kids aroundage  21 come in and then sometimes it's an older crowd. I haven't gotten a handle on what is the night that everyone loves the most. Sometimes it's a big crowd but the last time I went on a saturday, the place was practically empty. Which is a shame cause  Ernies in Chandler is a gem."}
{"text":"Small bar, but it's pretty much a guaranteed good time.  They have karaoke and that's always fun to watch.
Not as fun if you end up having one too many shots and become a karaoke singer yourself but it happens, right?"}
{"text":"Years ago we used to come here for crab dip and shrimp.  Best ever.  For some reason we hadn't come back for roughly 10 years.  Kids are older now so we decided to give it a go.  New Year's Eve so maybe the chef was off because nothing tastes as good as it used to be.  We ordered: 1lb of steamed shrimp $14.95. Crab dip $11.95 grilled Walleye $17.95.  

Steamed shrimp was overcooked.
Crab dip was good but not as great as I remembered. 
Walleye looked amazing on the plate but lacked flavor and was also overcooked. 

Service wasn't slow but the food took a long time for it to come out, not sure why... Leads be to believe understaffed in the kitchen as there was was mostly people drinking and not very many having dinner service.  

Our waiter was great and very attentive... However a really weird situation happened loudly by our table...  Waitress came in from the bar outside and starts to complain loudly to the owner? Manager?  About a patron who may have or may not have ordered a crab cake.  The waitress was extremely upset about it and the manager was trying to calm her down... The waitress storms off back to her area and the manager yells, \"Calm down!\"  Im laughing as I write this because it was that absurd... Even for a no frills no nonsense bar.  

Not sure if I'll give this place another go, I'm hoping it was just a one off since it was NYE...  Time will tell if I get another crazy craving for steamed shrimp."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Looks can be deceiving, it doesn't look like much but definitely worth checking out.  Has indoor bar area where the Karaoke is, I have been there twice and the same Karakoke DJ was there and he is super nice, always has big smile on his face, sings and helps people who need it (review below said he was a jerk, maybe a sub was there the night they were there).  

Service is really good, they are there right when you sit down and make sure you have what you need at all times.  The food was really good, I love onion rings and am pretty picky about them - I ate the whole plate.  My friend loves their cheeseburgers.  Pretty impressed with the quality of the food - but shouldn't be too surprised - I am sure there is a reason Ernie's has been open for 40 years!

They have a semi-outdoor patio and 2nd bar area where you can play pool, shuffleboard and there is smoking allowed there.  Highly recommend this place for couples, friends, girls' nights out.  Nice little dance floor by the Karaoke.  I was there last night and one couple sang \"You're the One that I Want\" from Grease and the guy then proposed to his girlfriend.  It was pretty cool!!  Go check it out and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Being from Baltimore, (Hon!), I've been dying to try this place, and what better time than on a Sunday for Ravens football. There was a small crowd, and lots of other Baltimorons wearing purple Ravens jerseys and cheering on my home team.

The decor is bar/pub, and I did like the open-air aspect, since it kept the cigarette smoke to a minimum. Everyone was very friendly, and there were plenty of nice tv's to watch the game on.

The food was very good, I had the MD style steamed shrimp, which came w/ lots of onions (very baltimore...), good amount of spice, and were tasty, though a tad overcooked. The sliders were excellent, and the wings were meaty and tasty...yet not what I ordered...which brings me to the service.

If I could give a separate rating for the service, there would be a whole lot of grey and verrry little orange on them stars above. The waiter/bartender took a while to even stop by our table (of which there were only about 3 or 4 with people at them), and didn't bother to write down our order. Ummm...time to retake that memory course, because he came back about 15 minutes later to \"go over our order\", and didn't get one thing correct. So just when we thought food was being delivered, it hadn't even been ordered yet.

I ordered a slider w/cheese (how they come anyway) for my son, and it arrived without cheese. (strike one) I ordered the Maryland wings (with old bay) and they brought regular buffalo wings. (strike two) My wife ordered the taco salad, which the menu states comes in one of those tortilla bowls, and it looked like an order of nachos from Taco Bell on some chips with FREEZING cold meat. (strike three) 

Three separate times, they came by with an order of crab dip (that looked tasty) asking if we ordered it. Guess the first two times they didn't believe us. He very rarely came by our table to notice my empty beer glass, maybe they were short on Fat Tire? I don't know.

So...great food, especially for a Baltimore-boy, yet horrible horrible service. Please, WRITE DOWN MY ORDER!! You're not impressing me when you try to memorize it. Especially when you go 0-for-3 in guessing what we ordered - and maybe check with me a few minutes later instead of when the food should be on my table.

4 out of 5 for the food, and as Dean Wormer said to Mr. Blutarsky about his grade point average...... Zero....Point.....Zero.....for the service. Hoping this is just bad luck, as I'll probably be back next Sunday to watch the Ravens beat down the Steelers, but I'll bring a pen and paper for you, Mr. Bartender. Please write it down."}
{"text":"Great place to do Karaoke (available every night). 

They also have another full bar \"outside\" where you can smoke, play pool, darts, etc...

Decent grub and stiff drinks.

Gets really busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I think this place was pretty good.  I'm an east coaster.  I usually cook my own shellfish when I get a craving for it but this time I felt like getting some in public.  The patio is smoking which for us smokers is a rare treat.  They had poker going on that night.  They basically took up the entire patio but they seemed like wonderful people (I love to play free Texas Hold Em but the wife was with me) they were polite and having fun.

The service was EXCELLENT.  Two bartenders on that night.  They seemed incredibly busy with the poker people but they always came and checked on us.  Never once did we feel ignored.  To be honest, it was the best service I've had in quite some time.  Extra bonus points seeing they running around for the poker people.

The food was outstanding.  I had crab cakes and they were AMAZING.  My wife had the talipa and it was tasty.  

Overall, this is my kind of place and I would come here again.  If time allows it, I'd love to come back to play poker."}
{"text":"I really wish you could somehow fire the guy who does karaoke on weekends. He's literally the worst. Sings when 30 people are waiting to sing, is annoying and skips people on the list, and he slowly filters in new people who come in with the people who've already been singing so it takes twice as long to sing. Just put people on the list as they put their names in!! Was waiting already an hour and a half to sing and went outside for 10 minutes(right after checking to see that my name was 8 people down) and come back and he says he skipped me on the list and said I'd have to wait another 6 people before I got to sing and told me I should have been paying better attention. What would you like me to do sir? Sit there and stare at the screen for 120 minutes? Sounds great. Then he told me that he doesn't understand why me and him always have a problem... are you sure you don't? Told him I'm I've never had a problem with any other karaoke guy that works here. Been coming for about 5 years. Just.... please ... get rid of him"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here however the karaoke is great. Service okay. We like to sing all was great! Younger crowd that makes you feel welcome. We are in our 60's and had a blast."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. The crabs were steamed and seasoned perfectly. The Maryland crab soup is Ah-Mazing!!!! Happy hour has good prices and the owner Michael comes around and chats with all the tables. I love this place and now that I have found it I will be a regular."}
{"text":"As I write this I am crying. I have never been treated with such disrespect. I closed out my tab after one beer and nothing was said. My boyfriend was laughed at when he ordered a water and said he was driving and the older woman serving us said \"this is a bar\" and sneered at him. I later decided to reopen my tab for one shot and was told I couldn't because it cost them money to reopen my tab. I tried to reason them and was called a bitch by the manager. I then went to the bouncer who swiftly kicked me out while the manager laughed. This used to be my favorite place but no one told me there was a 10 dollar minimum or I would have kept my tab open. I am swiftly reporting them to the better business bureau and contacting the owner as soon as possible."}
{"text":"delicious fresh seafood.. happy hour is great. try the coconut shrimp and the broiled crab cake its amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Think you have a good voice, and love to sing??  OR do you love to watch people make a fool of themselves in front of others.  If EITHER of these describes you, you're gonna love Ernies.  Known for it's offering of nightly karaoke, Ernies provides young and old vocalists/entertainers alike the stage to belt their heart out to all of their favorite songs.  What I really like about Ernies is that for those that truly do come here to actively participate, it's not full of 'regulars' that run the show - leaving you lucky to get one song in at the end of the night, and only if you've slipped the karaoke master a $20 (as has been my experience with the OTHER karaoke bar in Old Town Scottsdale that shall remain nameless) The bar is not fancy by any means, but it's nice and clean.  The drinks are cheap.  Not into singing?  Try one of their other rooms.  They have pool tables, rooms for dining (I've never tried their food, so I can't speak to that), and lots of places to stand/sit/observe.  I did notice that some other reviews have commented on the karaoke people not allowing them to sing without tipping first, and that has not yet been my experience there.  I've found them to be fair and keep to a good rotation.  This place is a blast to go with a group, too!"}
{"text":"I've been an Ernie's customer for 30 years.  Used to be my favorite spot and our friends drive 60 miles round trip to meet us there.  Waitress Sue, is rude, demanding, and obnoxious.  Food was cold, (from her lack of urgency to serve it).  She lingered at our table encouraging us to finish eating so she could clean up.  We were still eating because she would not put our order in.  She told us the kitchen was too backed up and we needed to just drink and talk.  We have always appreciated Nikki's service as well as others'.  Sue has got to go!"}
{"text":"Taking some of the negative reviews into consideration I understand where some of you are coming from... The great thing about it however is that they have a pretty good selection of something for everyone I had no idea there would be sea food on the menu so that was a bit of a shocker. Food was all a little over cooked and you could tell the oil needed to be changed because you could taste a little of everything they deep fried in it... My salad was pretty good I got the Cobb salad and the person I was with got fish n chips. The waiter may have been the owner or manager not sure but after reading some of the other reviews I wasn't about to complain considering he could have lashed out at us. Anyway I give this 3 stars as it was a good menu, service was okay... Prices pretty predictable for a sit down place like this... Probably wont go back though."}
{"text":"Maryland style crab cake lovers, here's the place! It only took me two years to find an awesome, truly, Maryland style crab cake. If you are looking for a hometown fun experience, leave your baggage at the door. This is a down home fun place with excellent crab cakes. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar with a good size outdoor area.  I don't like how they have the karaoke set up however.  You can't see the \"stage\" area unless you are one of the three front tables.  Find a new way where all the seats can see the karaoke area without having a giant bar in the way."}
{"text":"This place is fairly cheap and looks like it could be fun, but tonight it was kind of empty, although we went fairly early. They had karaoke which was extremely loud and the bar had many older people there. Our waiter was not super awesome, we waited for a long time to get our tab and came to find out he was singing karaoke.... very poorly. So that is not real appealing. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"This is what a bar experience should be like!

Great friendly staff.  Diverse crowd.  Plenty of options for food and drinks. 

Very comfortable atmosphere. Sports on TV's but not taking away from the ability to start and share conversations.  Pool tables (with bill acceptor) anf shuffleboard available. 

Menu is influenced with New England style seafood options.  

I felt like this is the kind of place you can stop in and not be in a hurry to leave."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stayed at the Gainey Ranch golf resort in Scottsdale and because we like to experience the local cuisine we found Ernie's on Yelp.  We decided to try it and loved it.  Surprisingly great seafood and excellent service.  The decor could be updated but don't let that deter you from experiencing a great meal."}
{"text":"Seven of us went to Ernie's for a Christmas karaoke tradition. It's a nice place with a huge selection of all kinds of music and Karaoke seven nights a week. Everyone in our group who wanted to sing got at least one opportunity and there was even some dancing going on. My only complaint is that the PA system was way too loud, which made it hard to hear the singers and also made my ears ring. I kept stepping into the hallway to get out of the sound waves as they were actually painful. We all had fun while we were there, but left early and decided we probably won't go back because of the excessive decibels."}
{"text":"We visited in January while Barret Jackson auction was in town...

This is one of the few Karaoke bar's that was not overly crowded and had room for everyone..... in scottsdale. 

Service was great, food was delicious, and the Karaoke was awesome!!! Even the Karaoke dj was awesome... his voice was perfect!!! 

Recommend going here for food and Karaoke... and the wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday - (his name Pete Parker) yes just like spider man.

Anyway, I had a great time with the group of people that went, did the whole 9 with karaoke and awesome IPA's on tap.  I definitely suggest grabbing the hot wings while you hang out and enjoy this dive bar.  It's a perfect kind of place and just what Scottsdale needs. 

 Fun and enjoyable but near the end of the night, my buddy had a mishap in the bathroom, credit to over drinking and not to the delicious wings."}
{"text":"Came here for karaoke on Saturday night - so much fun! It's not the trendiest/nicest place, but people really get into the singing and dancing. I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Only place in Phoenix / Scottsdale where you can sit at bar and smoke. Cheap drinks and easy going girls. Cool local spot to play some pool and darts and get some good cold beers and stiff drinks."}
{"text":"Great sound for karaoke! Good selection of music.
The crab cakes REALLY TRUELY are just like you get in Baltimore! Stay away from the fried shrimp n cod way over done, but the walleye is yummy!
Didn't see any snowbirds and the voices that did show were unusually good. 
If you want a place around Mesa AZ, it's the best choice!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times with clients who wanted to get drunk.   Doesn't that just sound like a barrel of laughs?  It's my job to make sure they don't get killed, and that no one else gets tipsy and reveals any company secrets.  I've had that responsibility many times before.  Gotta tell you, this was a great place for it.

The bar is nice, long, and while not too loud - loud enough that everyone can't hear everything you're saying.  It's Scottsdale enough that the client has liked the vibe, but neighborhood enough that the client feels like he's just at a neighborhood bar.  Bonus.  

If you're looking for a place to hide out a bit from all your regular places, this seems like a good stop as everyone seems friendly and laid back.  I'd love to go for karaoke instead of babysitting clients one day.  

I can't tell you what the service is like because honestly - the only times we've been there we've immediately handed them a corporate credit card for the tab and they pretty much know that they will get a big tip as long as they keep the drinks coming.  So the bartenders have quickly become our best friends.  Smart bartenders."}
{"text":"For karaoke alone it is incredible!  Beer is over priced even for Scottsdale.  I still love this place."}
{"text":"This place is a barrel of monkeys. Great bar food, great fun, and good time. Hilarious good time if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"I love me a good dive bar, and I love me some Karaoke, so this place is a no-brainer for me, located in North Scottsdale within spitting distance of my place.  This place is exactly what a dive bar should be, rough around the edges, filled with drunk, obnoxious people singing badly, drinks that are of questionable label, and barely anything to prevent me from ordering another drink and enjoying a smoke on the patio.  I've heard the food is great, but I have to confess I've never had it, I'm giving it five stars for being the down and dirty hole in the wall I need among the pretentious watering holes of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"As a Marylander, I am vouching for the crabcakes here! They are so good!! Great food, good prices, atmosphere is awesome...oh...and they have a sweet karaoke set up!! One of my favorite spots in the valley :)"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is incredibly cool! My husband and I are karaoke fanatics, and this is the first time we've seen a restaurant offering karaoke SEVEN, yes 7, days a week! Not only that, the food is pretty good as well! There were quite a few singers that were better than you'd find in the average karaoke hangout. We were impressed, and if we get back to the Phoenix area, we will be sure and come back!"}
{"text":"If you want a good neighborhood bar, Ernie's is exactly that. This is the place I go when I'm not looking to get all dolled up but I still want to go out. There is nothing unique about it, it is just a bar that is good at being a bar. It also has all of the best activities for drinking. 

I LOVE shuffleboard and a dive-bar is not a dive-bar without it. Great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing (I smoke when I drink, yes filthy, disgusting habit I'm aware) ...sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not, depends on the bartender I think. 
They also have two pool tables, and I think golden tee. 
Their is a room that has karaoke. I am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time, the night I participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone. The karaoke DJ. has a really good selection of songs, lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for. 
I tend to get hit on every time I'm there which I guess is an ego boost but I would prefer to be left alone at a place like this. I'm usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and don't feel like making new friends but that's just me. 

Not sure about their drink selection, I always just get Michelob Ultra (lame I know) or cranberry/vodka...the mixed drinks are strong, their well is gross though but to be expected. 

Always a good laid back time at Ernies. They can count on me as a regular."}
{"text":"Because it's not in my neighborhood, I only get over to Ernie's once or twice a year when I'm really in the mood for karaoke and crab cakes. I've had positive experiences in the past, so I was surprised to see so many negative reviews here on Yelp. Until I went this past weekend.

Because of rainy weather all day, it was no surprise that the place wasn't busy - so you'd expect we'd have attentive service, right? Nope. The first server we had was surly, impatient and definitely seemed annoyed at having to answer our questions about the menu (seriously, she looked as us like we were friggin' idiots for asking questions). The food took a while, the drinks she served were harsh and she never came back to check on us, so I had to go to the bar myself to get my drink fixed (how hard is it to make an orange juice and vodka?) The food, when it finally came was just \"meh\".

We were sitting too close to a speaker so we couldn't hear each other, so we moved to another booth which got us a different server, but his attitude wasn't any better. We were still basically ignored and had to find someone else to order any additional food or drinks and basically bussed our own table.

My poor friend had the worst of it all though -- she gave her card to the bartender to pay her food & drink tab -- and 45 minutes later he had still not come back. We finally had to go ask WTF? Turns out their machine was down. Um, they couldn't have told us that? They kept us waiting still longer and finally suggested we go get cash from an ATM (which is what her BF had to do). Did they offer anything for this inconvenience? Hell, no!! Same surly attitude from the manager on down, no comped sodas for our DD's, nothing but the inconvenience of having to track down an ATM and get our own damn cash our because they couldn't tell us for a friggin' hour their machine was down!

To top it off, my friend has left her keys in the first booth we'd been in but when she asked three different employees if anyone had turned in keys, WITHOUT EVER LOOKING they all said \"no\". Until she finally asked a fourth employee (after franctically searching the bar, the restaurant, the ladies room, the parking lot, etc.) \"Yeah, said, employee #4, they're right here (on the bar).\" Nobody could've looked?!?!?

Yeah, miserable experience, top to bottom. Think we'll find someplace where they actually LIKE their customers!!!"}
{"text":"would definitely come back for the Crab cakes again.. ~!!  Service was slow........  but it was a a pleasant meal.  Divey lil place but clean and pleasant :)"}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner on a Sunday evening to give it a try.  The level of service was all right, but we did not enjoy the food.  Everything seemed really bland."}
