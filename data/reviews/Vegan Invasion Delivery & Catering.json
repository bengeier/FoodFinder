{"text":"On a resent trip to Phoenix I had the opportunity to try Vegan Invasion. What a pleasant refreshing experience! Everything is so fresh and yummy, my favorite is the Tostadas I had to have two!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are amazing! And the salsa!!!! Is the best! Their food is so good, I wish I live closer so I can have it on the regular."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found Vegan Invasion! Recently my family and I have began to transition to vegetarian/vegan and had no idea where to start. While doing some research I came across this company and its exactly what we were looking for! With meal prep AND delivery it has made this transition so smooth for us! Dominque is so helpful in explaining everything and her weekly menus are so detailed and yummy! I love supporting local businesses as well as a nice family!"}
{"text":"I was really wanting to start the new year off by eating clean, there are not a whole lot of vegan meal prep options out there decided to give vegan invasion a try. I called one evening (6:45pm)to inquire about a monthly meal plan because their website I guess is updated weekly with meal options I just wanted to see the variety & options that I could possibly choose from since the company dose not have a physical location, I received no answer (no big deal I left a message). Few days pass no answer, I figured hey they must be busy first of the year lots of orders coming in so I decide to write an email about the questions I listed above. Few days later still no reply (I checked my spam/junk folder as well no messages). Well I cannot comment the the food (looks delicious by the way) I just could never get get in touch with anyone to inquire about their business, customer service that's kind of important to me."}
{"text":"I was really nervous about trying vegan food. Like really? No cheese or butter? Cmon. So I tried it and LOVED it! Domonique and Fanny do such a great job explaining what's in the food and how this benefits your body and the environment ! I definitely recommend this to anyone on the vegan fence. I promise you won't be disappointed!!"}
