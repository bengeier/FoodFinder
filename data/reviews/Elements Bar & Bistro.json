{"text":"Two issues of lack of communications compel me to downgrade my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. The food remains 4 to 5 stars but service is always factored into my reviews and communications failures I consider to be definitely issues of service.

The First Issue: 

Elements Bistro had a promotion called the \"12 Days of Christmas\". Essentially it was the same lunch buffet only $6.00 more for the Christmas season. They did not advertise in their website, I found out when I received my check. I visited their website less than half an hour before I went for lunch. When brought to the attention of the management, they said it would be corrected but it was not.

However, I must also give praise where praise is due. For lunch they served braised short ribs in a wine au jus as well as the usual amazing accompaniements. The short ribs were tender, very much full of flavor as short ribs should be, and the sauce expertly prepared. Regardless of the communications issue, I did get value in what I ate. What concerns me is that if a pensioner on a tight budget came in, the place attracts many regulars who are older adults, and they were used to paying the lower amount, it would be an unneccesarily embarassing situation for them when their cheque arrives.

The Second Issue: 

Elements offered a Christmas Day supper buffet extravaganza. The problem is that they told nobody about it. They chose not to advertise and neither did they inform their public on the hotel website. Regulars like me, who also book meetings and other events in the hotel, were totally unawares that this event was even happening. When I found out, all available seatings were booked. I was at Elements only the week before when tables were still available and I had spoken directly to the management at that time when they sat down at my table.

I consider lack of communications to be a huge faux pas on the part of any business, be they in the catering business or even transportation and telecommunications. I was looking for something like the Christmas Day buffet to occupy me for the day yet they chose not to inform me or many others.

As much as I think the food at Elements Bistro is superb, which it truly is, I feel let down, as if I am not as important as the other clients they chose to inform that this event was happening. What was their criteria for chosing whom to inform and whom not to inform? Considering that they have my complete contact information, I am even more disappointed. 

I will not allow them to insult me by offering a free meal which I will refuse. I would much rather just see breakdowns like this be remedied. However, I will gladly accept the offer of a meal, to be served at a future date, that is the full equivalent to the one offered on Christmas Day, both in quality and breadth at which time I will most graciously pay them the full $48.00 they were charging for the event I sadly missed.

YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALL OF YOUR CUSTOMERS.

Regardless of my huge disappointment, I still think the food you serve is incredible. I am also confident you will address this issue because you have proven yourself eager in the past to always improve and you do so very successfully."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place for lunch- the menu has variety and the place isn't full at all so service is decent.

Where it falls flat is the worn out feel of the decor and the price point for food - average $18 per item.

Go for a casual lunch with good service expectations and you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Bistro at the delta downtown. Ok food, had the linguini and clams with a glass of Melbac. Was good but not outstanding.  If staying at the hotel and looking for a food and drink I would come here."}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I met here for a little nibble at lunch. The service was impeccable. They were very attentive, and ensuring we were happy. 

The starting chips are yummy, and the salmon salad (the only thing I could eat) was pretty good, except the price. $18 for a salad, that had lettuce, a chunk of salmon, and two strawberries is a little steep. 

The buffet looked good, but was not running when we were there."}
{"text":"An above average Sunday brunch. Try the grilled salmon! Its a bit on the pricey side at $27+ per person but the food quality is great and the staff are friendly and professional.  Also, they comp your parking on Sundays."}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  Steak and salmon overcooked, vegetables bland and somewhat mushy.  Service was good, but overall the preparation of the food was not in line with the prices. Would not visit again."}
