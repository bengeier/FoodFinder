{"text":"5 Star all the way. I left a wordy review in tips, but they're top notch. The latte was amazing! Way better than some other places."}
{"text":"Think Panera Bread with more of a coffee shop feel."}
{"text":"Nice place for a casual business meeting or to get some work done.  Free wifi too.  Do enjoy the pastry selection.  The salads/sandwiches seems a bit small for the price, which is my only complaint.  The food does taste good, just wish there was more of it."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The White chocolate macadamia nut latte was awesome!"}
{"text":"If you like light to medium roast coffee this is the place to be. I couldn't find better one on east side of Madison in last few years with the same consistency.
Always not too slow not too busy. You can hear another person if you are not alone. Never had a problem.
Had lunch once, if I remember correct it was on ok side. 
Plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Service was great!  My latte was outstanding and the fiesta omelette was well prepared. Presentation on everything was nicely done."}
{"text":"Stopped here because it was the closest to the freeway through Madison. I prefer non-franchised coffee shops to the big chains.  Best dirty chai (red eye chai) I have ever had! The macchiatos are weird though, they put them in mini cups."}
{"text":"The coffee was very good but I was trying to get some work done but I was not able as the Internet was very poor"}
{"text":"I have been here before numerous times and have always had a great experience with the food, drinks, and customer service. I went there today to get some quiet time to get some work done and it was perfect. I had the peanut butter blended drink, you just can't go wrong with that! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and I can safely say that it's a 3 star place.  I got breakfast food every time and it was always pretty tasty.  I've had the quiche and the California breakfast sandwich.  The quiche came with a side of fruit, but just barely filled me up.  The sandwich was a bit more filling but no side of fruit :/
I also had a blueberry scone which was good but not great.  My friend got an iced mocha which was disgusting!  
There is a small kids area which was nice for my baby to play in, though it was right under the windows and was scorching hot.  
Cashier was sort of rude.  The last time I was here I went up to order something 3 times (drink, then food, then a scone to go) and by the 3rd time she was so rude, didn't even say thank you.  Um.... sorry I keep spending money here?  
Nothing outstanding here, but a much better choice than a fast food chain if you're in this area for breakfast time."}
{"text":"This is the probably best coffee shop on the east side of Madison. Great food and coffee, super nice baristas, and an awesome atmosphere. It's great for work meetings, coming to study, or just to relax."}
{"text":"Great food, free wifi and a fire place. What's not to love? It is one of my favorite hangouts!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee. Quiche was so-so. Fairly eggy and seemed to have used puff pastry as crust. It wasn't as delicate as I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING! It is the perfect location to meet up with friends or go to by yourself. The noise level is perfect not too loud.. not to quiet. Plus, besides the great selection of drinks (especially sugar-free) they also have a wide selection of food unparalleled to starbucks or caribou. 

Happy Sipping!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best coffee place in Madison. Remarkably consistent and I'm a fan of cafe bianco which is getting harder and harder to find. Scones are great and their food is excellent. Great service and comfy."}
{"text":"Great place to relax, read and have good coffee and bakery.  Only complaint I would have is that on both ends of the main area the lights are ridiculously bright, could lower the wattage and it would be more than enough for people to see, have heard this from others as well"}
{"text":"The cafe was clean and the cookie and coffee was delicious. Great customer service, as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to study or to get your post-workout smoothie!

The ambiance is great for studying, just loud enough to keep me from feeling antsy and quiet enough that I don't get annoyed by other patrons.

This is possibly the best cafe for a balance of coffee and food. I would actually eat here, as opposed to most coffee shops. Really, 90% of the time I'd rather starve than eat the stale baked goods. 

Also, right next to Princeton Club."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and enjoy good coffee and food. They have a meeting room that can be reserved to allow some privacy.  I love sitting by the fireplace and catch up with friends. 
They used to open on Sundays but not anymore but I still make it there a handful of times a month to study or just pick up some coffee."}
{"text":"Came here for coffee and it was a pretty cool place. Very nice and cozy and most importantly, it was quiet. Ordered the White something... I can't recall but it was pretty good. It took a while to make but it was pretty good. It tasted kind of like a breakfast cereal to me. Anyway, the bathrooms are nice and clean, the place itself is nice and clean. I didn't order food but I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place may be out by the mall, but it is one of my favorite places to write in Madison. The staff here are amazingly helpful. The coffee is fabulous (locally roasted), the food is fresh and tasty, and (even though it isnt advertised) they have Gluten-Free bread!!!! :)  They even have a separate meeting/gathering room. Love!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cool Beans a couple of times thanks to a co-worker. This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee with a friend or meet for a work meeting. The coffee is great and I usually buy the endless cup as I stay for a couple of hours. The food is great as well. The sandwiches are definitely something to try.

The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. There are tables and chairs throughout and then there are some comfy chairs if looking for a more relaxed seat. If you are in Madison on the East Side this a great place to go."}
{"text":"Though the desolate strip mall Cool Beans is at looks like a scene from the Walking Dead early in the morning, this is one coffee shop worth visiting. A stone's throw away from East Towne, in an area without many establishments that are warm and have character, Cool Beans is an oasis of both. It's bigger than you'd guess from the outside, has a fireplace, a cozy atmosphere, good service, very good coffee, and a surprisingly wide array of food items. My absolute favorite is the perfectly toasted California breakfast sandwich, with melted cheese, tomato, avocado and a light, absolutely delicious sauce that is simply to die for. You have to try it; it's one of the very best breakfast sandwiches anywhere in Madison. I live nowhere near Cool Beans, but whenever I have anything at all to do in that neck of the woods I always go an hour early just to stop in there. I only hope one day they'll have locations all over town!"}
{"text":"Cool Beans saved my Christmas vacation!

While in town visiting family over the holidays, my hubby and I found Cool Beans.  It was our refuge as we endured the stresses of visiting family.

The coffee and food is good.  The 3-way fireplace is awesome!  What a terrific place to hang out, not be bothered, and work on the computer.  The staff is friendly the place is clean and inviting.

The East Side has needed a place like this for a long time, and I'm glad that Cool Beans has finally filled that niche.

The next time we're in town, we'll make sure to stop in for a cuppa Joe."}
{"text":"Just had the best vegan bagel sandwich at Cool Beans! The barista was able to modify one of the existing sandwiches on the menu. Had avocado, spinach, marinated portobello mushrooms and roasted red pepper. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I met a colleague here for a business meeting today. It was great! The coffee was great, well priced and served in a wonderful mug. The staff was helpful and friendly and the decor quite pleasant. The tables were spread out far enough that conversations at other tables were not intrusive and the overall volume was actually quite low for the number of people present. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"great place for some coffee, lunch and some homework. I ordered the southwest chicken wrap, very very good! full of flavor and it comes with a side of fruit or salad. don't forget the Free wifi!! plenty of places to sit and enjoy time to yourself or with friends."}
{"text":"The bakery from the \"River Bakery\" was phenomenal, and warranted a 5 star rating on its own.  Unfortunately, the microwaved omelette that accompanied it was less deserving.   It was served \"Hot\" and topped with fresh ingredients... But the undeniable microwaved texture erased the points for presentation.  I will definitely give Cool Beans another try... And will no doubt look for a menu selection that will highlight one of the River Bakery's multi grain bread's.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is warm and inviting, comfortable.  Free WiFi, a fireplace and excellent Hot Coco"}
{"text":"Decided to skip town and go for a day trip to Madison. This was our first stop. Wonderful ambiance, pleasant staff. By the fire place is a very relaxing place to read a book (and also listen to some older gentlemen converse for a laugh or two). This place feels very \"homey\" and comfortable. 

I will definitely be coming back if I'm ever in the area.

Though, if I may comment, it would be nice to see books around. Maybe a free library in the future?"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always good. I have the spinach wrap burrito which is very tasty. They have homemade soup and salads that are very good too.  Pastrys are good and fresh. Many choices for coffee and smoothys or you can just have their house blend and add your cream etc. seating is comfortable and a nice atmosphere with fireplace. Plenty of parking out front. I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Per usual, this coffee addict is always looking for cool places to grab coffee. I genuinely liked the coffee and smoothie I had from here. The staff was friendly, lots of seating, and good selection of bakery, sandwiches, food options. The only thing missing is something to make it super unique in comparison to other coffee shops. I definitely recommend and will be back"}
{"text":"I like this place. The service was prompt with a smile. Everytime I went while visiting Madison the coffee was great. They either have an excellent roaster, or train their staff really well (or both). I  like my coffee to taste like coffee. Not the sugary, foo foo, macha frappa jacka whatever. 

So if you believe that coffee roasting is an art and not a fad, check this place out. It has a great energy too. Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good post movie date spot"}
{"text":"Needed a quick afternoon pick me up and there are few coffee shop choices on Madison's far Eastside.

It is open and spacious with lots of nice and varied seating. Lots of big windows to allow sunlight in. The space is very inviting, friendly and soothing. Coffee is good too, at modest prices.

Partner had the white cloud which is white coffee, white chocolate, macadamia nut  flavoring and steamed milk. \"Awesome,\" she said. I had the miel latte which was a special.  Other than cinnamon, I don't know what is in it but it is good. (Hey, I'm easy like Sunday morning).  Also got me a cup of their black thunder. Also very good. I should be pretty amped for the rest of the afternoon.

Appears to be handicapped accessible and children friendly too. They have a munchkin seating and play area. Awesome.

I definitely recommend visiting.

See you there."}
{"text":"Absolutely best coffee in Madison, topped with a healthy serving of excellent service. Ambiance is perfect for studying (this is, in fact, my second home), hanging out with friends, reading a book by the fire, or conducting a business meeting. They have an excellent assortment of drinks (caffeinated and not) and food.
Skip the poor-tasting, cookie-cutter Starbucks and experience some real coffee made by people who actually take pride in their job... and check out the latte art before you put your lid on--they're getting good! :)"}
{"text":"I've drove by this place several times but never took the time to stop until tonight.  My friend and I were waiting to pick up another friend from the airport and decided to spend and hour just sitting and talking at some coffees shop and this one happen to be close by.

It was quiet and not too many people when we got there.  We were quickly greeted and told my the person taking our order to take our time to look at the menu.  Being later at night my friend didn't want any caffeine so he offered up several options for her to try.  Both our coffees were delivered to our table and the person bringing them to us was very friendly and welcoming.  We also had a lemon scone which was really good.

I will make sure to stop back."}
{"text":"Was staying for a night close by in Madison and stopped here to get coffee. I wanted to avoid Starbucks, because I find that I learn more about the place that I am staying if I avoid chains. This place was decently, honestly it wasn't much different than Starbucks but the people were nice, it was clean and I was able to sit there for a bit in quiet and read and sit my coffee. I think I was wearing a cardigan in July (the 60 degree morning was chilly for me, coming from Los Angeles!) and they gave me a hot latte when I ordered a cold one (-.-) but were pretty good about fixing the order and bringing it out. I just tossed it up to them thinking I needed to be warmed up in my cardigan.

I later found out that this place is run by some Christian organization, which I would never have known while I was there. They don't do anything to forward religion, just coffee. I doubt it would have really bothered me if there was a crucifix up or something, as long as they didn't try to tell me about religion. 

One of the things I missed living LA having come from Toronto is people can be actually decent to each other. I felt that people here were nice and police without it just being a facade of customer service."}
{"text":"I have lunch here all the time. The veggie wrap, Greek breakfast burrito and the caprese sandwich are terrific. They serve great local coffee and desserts too. The meeting room in the back can be reserved for small groups (say 10-15). Friendly staff and locally owned."}
{"text":"I spend too much time in \"hipster\" cafes so I didn't think I'd like this place.  This is the kind of place I think my grandparents would like to hang out in, but I was pleasantly surprised.  There's a lot of tables and free wifi which I definitely appreciate.  The fireplace is nice, and the coffee and pastries were good.  We didn't try any food but it sure looked and smelled delicious from what we saw.  We'll be back for breakfast someday."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things I liked about Cool Beans Cafe. 

- It's local and not a chain 
- The post it note collage reading material provided for you while you wait for your coffee
- The featured non-profit highlighted on the back table on the way to the restrooms
-The three sided fireplace
-The local artists work and jewelry for sale 

However, I find the coffee overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Nice free wireless.  Awesome coffee.  Good cobb salad."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service, however the food itself was unfortunately a different story. The chicken jerk pita I got was devoid of any basic flavor. It was very boring and lacked any seasoning which was disappointing for something with jerk seasoning in its name. The side of fruit was fresh but didn't make up for the the main course."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Cozy, fireplace, really good coffee.  Some nice paintings on the wall but the one is a myth.  It shows Monona Terrace with the sun setting nearby.  ( I think it is the sun- I forget)  Anyway, the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty tough to paint the sun there.  Other than that it is a good painting.  The painting of downtown Madison in the rain is fantastic.   I wonder if I could buy that one?
Enjoy the coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and food. The owner/chef must be a breakfast master, because my breakfast bagel was the best I've ever had. The flavors ooze out of the fresh bites. Atmosphere is very clean, comfortable, and has a fireplace! The service was also beyond the standard, probably because it is a LOCAL business that really cares. Will return with friends!"}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop close to my gym. We're here about 4 days a week. With a variety of coffees they rotate through daily you can't go wrong. Nice bakery and sandwich & salad type menu. Closed on Sundays and most holidays but other than that I can count on them for my coffee needs. 

Another bonus is their meeting room in back that can be reserved with a minimum food purchase. With free wifi it's an easy way to throw together a meeting for your group."}
{"text":"We all have our favorites...and mine is Cool Beans. The coffee is amazing as expected, but for me it's the people that make the culture; and the culture is what I most love about Cool Beans. I go often, would consider myself a regular. The chairs by the fire place (especially in the winter) are my favorite. I have a lot of meetings there and it's a very well know, easy-to-find location with great parking! Can't say enough great things about Cool Beans!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local coffee shops in Madison, WI.  I enjoy the atmosphere, smooth jazz, the variety of places you can sit, free wifi, great food & pastries and the coffee is pretty good too!  The fireplace is great in the winter and adds a nice touch.  The staff is always friendly and courteous.  A special area is set aside for kids."}
{"text":"Probably the worst cup of coffee I've ordered in Madison.  The seating is crowded and uncomfortable.  Also, had to use the Christian Stores Wifi.  I'll skip this place next time."}
{"text":"Fabulous coffee shop. Coffee is good, baristas are friendly, baked goods are tasty. Skip the corporate coffee and buy local."}
{"text":"I stopped by Cool Beans to get some work done before the long weekend. Mid-morning the cafe was pretty quiet, mostly comprising randoms with laptops like myself. I was able to snag a large table in the back with a sunny, patio-view window and a convenient electrical outlet by my side. The wireless internet was fast and reliable, which was a welcome benefit.

Shortly after noon I went up to the front to order lunch and selected the Sir Isaac Turkey. Lately I've been on a kick of fruit in savory dishes and the strawberry mayo and apple slices paired with turkey and cheddar sounded tasty and unique (I've never, ever heard of strawberry mayo - you're crazy, Cool Beans). 

I was glad I chose what I did - it was a really good flavor profile that hit the spot. I went with fruit for my side choice (the others were chips and salad) and was pumped when it was strawberries, pineapple, and grapes. So often the fruit is melon, which is fine, but these are much better.

I'll definitely be returning to Cool Beans to mix up my work schedule - they have a lot to offer both in menu and ambiance."}
{"text":"So I was in Madison the other day picking up my carpooler near the East Town Mall and I admit....I was trying to find anything that would give me a caffeine buzz....okay I admit it, I was seeking out a Starbucks because at this point....Anything will do!! 
I Yelped Coffee Shops nearby and got this little gem! Too cute! Coffee was awesome and also got a bagel to go. The scene inside was comfy and cozy, too bad I had to jet, otherwise I would have enjoyed sipping on my java inside instead of on the highway! I am happy I know about this place tucked back off the well beaten path!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service here! Everything is consistent and the portions really fill you up. We also really enjoy that they have a small children's area with toys! Cool Beans is very family friendly."}
{"text":"Best latte I've had in a long, long time. I will admit I'm difficult to please, but they nailed it. My latte had the perfect touch of sweetness, and they served it in an handmade ceramic mug. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Healthy lunch items on the menu.  Quiches are delicious, hot, but not made to order.  Can be a little pricey on the beverage side ($3-5 for lattes, coffee, mocha, or hot chocolate).  Urban interior with cozy surroundings.  Snuggle up to the fireplace or find a table or up top counter to plug in the computer.  I like the mix of people and the free WiFi while sipping on a Hot Chai Latte.  Kiddie area outside and inside.  Patio area in summer is nice but not shaded.  Back room area is great for 10-15 people and can be reserved."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients! I had the grilled veggie sandwich. It was good but next time I'll ask if they can throw some pesto on it as well. Had a bite of my husband's grilled chicken pesto and can't get the flavor out of my mind...mmm."}
{"text":"This place is cute, very comfortable inside and the staff is really nice :)

I got a breakfast sandwich and a white chocolate mocha both were so delicious!! skip the starbucks and head over here, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Open at 6:30AM?  Only having one barista at opening?  Ugh.  When I first moved here 3 years ago, I frequented this place for some studying.  I love their chai.

As time went on, I would come and they were closed randomly.  When I did make it in, the service was hit or miss.  The baristas seem to be rushed.  I had made it in at 6:30 am one morning, right when they opened and I was 2nd in line.  I waited about 20 minutes for my drink, getting it after 4 other people were served.  I get it was one barista working but I really had intended to get my drink and run...not really the case that morning.

Otherwise, their food is good.  A bit overpriced but there is not a lot of cafes or cute little shops in that area so they have the upper hand.  There are 3 Starbucks in a .5 miles in either direction of the place but I would prefer to support local shops over Starbucks, it is just hard to do that if they are not open or not able to serve in a timely manner.  Otherwise, I would come here when I have more studying to do when time is not an issue!"}
{"text":"Cool Beans. 
Neato.
Far out.

When did speech become so convoluted with things like verbs and syntax? 

Lucky for us, Cool Beans on the east side keeps it real... in more ways than one. First off, the seating is plentiful, and when you add a cool outside space during the warmer months, there's no shortage of real estate if your going at it solo or in a huge group. There's even a back room that looks like it can be closed off with a set of doors. Coffee and tea are what you'd expect, not the best brew I've had in town, but certainly not the worst. But it's their food options that blew me away originally. They really take the whole \"cafe\" thing to a new level with a plentiful amount of soup, salad and sandwich options to satisfy anyone. Think Panera, but much better. Much much better. The particular day I was there I dug into some minestrone and a half of a jerk sandwich served up on a toasted pita. Both were quite tasty. 

Add some free WIFI and decadent looking pastries and you have the makings for a pretty nifty spot for chit-chat, laptop'n or busting out the bridge set. People still do that, right?"}
{"text":"Cozy and fun coffee shop. I've had a sandwich and chai tea a few times with a friend here. I have bought two of their coffee cups and I love them. Great place to chill out on a cold day."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop, always love supporting local business. Love their tea selection and pastries are delicious as well as the other food options. Great atmosphere for hanging on your own, meeting friends, getting some work done and they have meeting room should the need arise! I highly recommend Cool Beans for you coffee shop needs!"}
{"text":"Staff did not acknowledge us in any way until we ordered, and were unable to answer basic questions about their products. 

We ordered a chicken salad sandwich; it was adequate, but I've had better. It was accompanied by a small bag of off-brand kettle chips and a tiny plastic sample cup full of \"pasta salad\", which was just some tough, flavorless penne noodles sprinkled with oregano. I expect a side dish accompanying a sandwich to be small, but seriously, a sample cup? Maybe it was intended to be decorative. 

We also had a \"classic\" smoothie, which was supposed to be made with real fruit and contain strawberries, banana and orange. It was decent, but so heavy on cheap orange juice that it overpowered the other flavors. 

Aside from the disappointing food and lack of service, it seemed to be a nice enough space. They had some distinctive furniture and a variety of seating, including both a bar and comfy chairs around a fireplace; a private room in the back available for reservation; and a large outdoor patio featuring a sandbox for the kids. 

The food seemed over-priced for the quality, but overall the pricing was competitive with other cafes in the area; while I can't recommend it for lunch, the patio might be a good place for parents to meet for coffee while their kids play in the sandbox. 

Honestly, I can't see any other reason to come here."}
{"text":"I love stopping at Cool Beans for a quick work-day lunch! It's one of my favorite places to bring a friend when we're meeting up during the work week.

Their food is great and made fresh - I've never had a bad dish here, but my favorite is the grilled vegetable sandwich with the side salad. I am also a big fan of their coffee drinks. Hazelnut lattes are my go-to.

Great little cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was nearby and did a search for close coffee shops. Looked like a cool place, however the service was pretty poor. There were two younger ladies working behind the counter and having a conversation so involved that they barely noticed I was there. I ordered the jalapeno savory scone but got a bacon one instead. And, when the barista handed me my drink and I said \"thank you\", she was still talking to the other girl and didn't acknowledge my existence whatsoever. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Another great local cafe found by the power of yelp! This cafe is right by the major highways and was on my way driving through IL. Its on your right side after you turn into the street and the sign is easy to find. This place has lots of seating, a great big fireplace in the middle with couches around it makes the environment very inviting to sit down and chat with friends/coworkers. I tried an iced mocha with whipped cream topped, they offer their coffee in 3 sizes. With my iced mocha I also ordered a chocolate croissant. Both were delicious and there were so many different choices in dessert that i want to try! Next time Im in the area I am definetly going to have to try their tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"Felt so uncomfortable had no greetings or customer service. Asked about the food and he had nothing good to say about it. Also he made my coffee and it was hardly warm....."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Madison I always spend some productive quiet time here. For the first time I had the spinach tortilla hame quesidilla, mmmmmm good!"}
{"text":"I was on the east side for the evening and saw Cool Beans. I remembered I had a coupon and decided to try them out. The staff was helpful in making my choice of drink, I got the Turtle latte. It was so amazing and the girl and the guy who were working there were friendly as could be. I will be going back! Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Cool Beans since I was in the area. The atmosphere is very nice. Cozy fireplace and plenty of tables make it easy to work, as long as you don't need a fast connection. WiFi has been really slow this morning, both 5 and 2.4. 

From a food/ drink perspective, the cappuccino was good. Nice layer of foam on top but not intrusive. 

I cannot recommend the hot food here, which is why it is 3 stars vs 4. I ordered the custom omelet. What I received was a rubbery, square egg concoction that looked like it came out of the microwave. I only ate about half and was only able to do that cause i was really hungry. 

So, come for the ambiance, come for the coffee, maybe come for the pastries, but definitely don't come for the hot food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in Madison, I can always rely on them to be friendly, professional and to serve up delicious food!

Today I enjoyed their butternut squash soup and half of a tuna melt.  Both were very tasty and the coffee was fresh and perfectly brewed.  

This coffeehouse has a large menu with fresh ingredients and their bakery counter always looks super tempting.

Bonus:  big two sided fireplace, cozy chairs and couch and a large children's play area."}
