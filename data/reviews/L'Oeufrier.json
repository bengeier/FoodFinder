{"text":"The Nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries was great!  My husband got the bagel sandwich with egg and cheese.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options if you weren't in the mood for something sweet.  They had tons of combo options that looked delicious but not a single one was veggie - boo.  We enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Lots of choices, really good food.  Smoothie samples provided to those in line.  What could be better than banana, Nutella and bacon on a waffle?  If you can't be happy here, you can't be happy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast !! Hugo the waiter very pleasant . We had the the grilled sandwiches ! Very tasty ! Same for smoothies !!!  The other amazing thing is that it is right beside the Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar !!! Best coffee I've had !   Enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience for my first breakfast in Montreal! Ordered the eggs benedicts with mushroom and it was delicious. Coffee is refillable and very fragrant, definitely one of good quality. Portions can be quite huge here so sharing would be a good idea. Service was good and the chill ambiance completed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Breakfast looked exactly like the pictures in the menu! That never happens!! Everything was delicious. Fresh fruit, breakfast poutine, eggs, pitatos, French toast, crepe, brioche... All fantastic! Good service too! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent location for brunch. If you're a fan of eggs benedict, this is the place for you. Staff was super friendly also. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and very nice design of the place. It is also located in a very convenient area of the village."}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed this place. The staff were very friendly. The food was delicious and the prices were good. Cute little spot to have breakfast, would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Superbe endroit pour le déjeuner. Service rapide et toujours courtois. Aliments frais, cuisson parfaite. Salle à manger très confortable.   Nous sommes venus à plusieurs reprise avec notre petite de 3 ans et à chaud fois ce fut une expérience des plus agréable!  La prochaine fois en essaie la Poutine à 30 piastres !"}
{"text":"Meilleur resto pour déjeuner dans Villeray!!! Les clients attendent à l'extérieur, café en main avec le sourire. Signe d'un restaurant qui vaut la peine d'attendre. Le proprio, Rui est un hôte exceptionnel qui a à coeur de rendre votre visite des plus agréable. Je recommande fortement :)"}
{"text":"Le service est excellent, les assiettes sont bien fournies. Menu très varié, beaucoup de choix. 'E restaurant est souvent pleins, car très bon resto pour une chaîne commerciale"}
{"text":"Quand tu veux du bon petit déjeuner sans t'éloigner de chez toi, difficile de trouver un bon petit spot qui t'offrira du bonheur. Dans Villeray, c'est l'Oeufrier qui fait ce travail de bonheur le matin dans la vie des gens.  Pour vivre tout proche de l'Oeufrier dans le très fabulous quartier de jeunes familles, jeunes couples de professionnel et jeunes étudiants qu'est Villeray, je ne peux que me réjouir d'un spot à petit déjeuner aussi convivial. Le service est des plus gentil et attentionné. Les gens du quartier sont peu pressés et prennent leur temps et même si le petit déjeuner n'est pas extraordinaire, il fait du bien le matin et est assurément préparé avec amour.  Récemment, l'Oeufrier a refait son menu pour offrir un grand choix de poutines déjeuner et des grilled cheese qui ont tous des drôles de noms. Ça devient comique de commander son plat.  Mention spéciale à leurs smoothies qui sont que trop DÉLICIEUX. Et pour faire avec la faune un peu hip et branché du quartier, qui sont aussi servi dans des pots masson."}
{"text":"This is my staple breakfast joint. Super good breakfast (three musketeers), toast is amazing, service always great, the price is right. Though a word of advice, if arriving around 10 - 12pm on weekends, you should plan on a little wait. Though they usually bring you some juice while you wait . Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Decent food, fruits were not as fresh as I'd like. Waffles were a bit dry, eggs however were excellent."}
{"text":"Resto de quartier, bon prix, bon service, malheureusement je n'y retournerai plus. La qualité des produits n'est plus au rv. Mon ami a mangé un grilled cheese qui suintait la graisse de bord en bord du pain. De mon côté mes pommes de terres roties goûtaient le gras bégétal rance et les oeufs sont trrrès ordinaires. Pour de la qualité je vais voir ailleurs."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic benedict. The benny itself was not so bad, the potatoes were dry and bland tasting (probably reheated).  Service is ok, just not somewhere that seems to be putting too much effort in trying to be the best. Also, everything is several dollars more expensove than other chain breakfast places. (15$ for the benny)"}
{"text":"I always love the food here, but they almost never cook my eggs properly. I'd estimate that I send my eggs back about 75% of the time, which leaves me eating alone because my friends are already finished by the time my meal is brought back to the table. (Why is it so difficult to get a hard poached egg?) Once I get the meal the way I've ordered it, it's delicious! Great menu variety and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"This was my second visit there. The first one was for a quick lunch about a year ago.  My lunch was ok, nothing special as their lunch menu is very limited. The service however was horrible. Yes, it was a busy lunch time but the serving staff was completely disorganised. They had forgotten part of my order and I only received it about 10 min. after I finished my plate.   I figured, well shit happens and some restaurants have bad days.  I also noticed they had an extensive and very original breakfast menu.  I went back there for breakfast today as I was in the area.  I wasn't in the mood for anything original and only had the 2 egg, saussage special. My partner had a grill-cheese and the party of 4 at the table besides us tried some of the more original offerings.  The food was good but nothing special according to all.  The service was however exactly the same as when I went last year.  It took us 2 hours between the time we sat down and the moment we got up, bringing a piece of toast with us cause we just couldn't stand being there any longer.  It didn't start well either. We saw a free table at the outside terrace but went inside to ask if we could just sit or they had to assign us a seat. After 5min. and being ignored by 2 waiters,  I asked a 3rd one, if we could go sit outside. He answered me me in a very aggressive and exasperated tone that the table (not the one we spotted) was dirty and to find a place inside.  Realising he didn't know there was a clean table outside, we went anyways and sat there.    It took about 15 min. before he brought us menus and about 20 min. more before a second waiter, who saw us getting fidgety took pitty on us and took our order. It took another 20-25 minutes before we got our food. We asked our waiter for coffee at least 3 times before we got some.  This same scenario was happening at every table around us. The party of 4, sitting next to us, told us they had been sitting there for close to an hour before they got their food. Two out of the four didn't receive their complete order. One got his side when his plate was almost finished and the other never got his toasts.  I asked for a coffee refil twice and never received it.  By the end of our breakfast, no less than 4 waiters has come to our table. It was the same for the other ones. Hence, it seems like tables are not assigned to waiters in this restaurant.  All in all, there are other breakfast restaurants within 5 min. walking distance of this place that are just as good and have exponentially better service.  I won't go back and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you are looking for a 2 hour breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Variété d'oeufs et de plats salés. Prix un peu élevé pour ce qu'ils proposent. Un bon brunch mais tout à fait classique."}
{"text":"We had a small wait and It took a while to get served but food was amaZing!! Huge portions and they don't skimp on the Nutella!! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. Service was quick even though it was busy. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Would definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was appalled by the lack of flexibility on the part of the management with regard to dietary restrictions. One of our party of 9 adults asked for a salad since they are a strict vegan and the management would not serve any vegetables in the form of a salad at lunchtime on the weekend, even though they clearly had vegetables on the premises. Furthermore, when asked if we could eat our own avocado, we were told that there would be a charge for giving a plate!!!! I do believe the server felt terrible that one guest could not be accommodated at all. With the number of people with allergies and health concerns, I am flabbergasted that a new restaurant such as this could have such a rigid and disrespectful attitude towards a patron.  Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants à déjeuner du plateau. Beaucoup de choix, très variés, et tous très bons. Le service est impeccable, les refills de café sont réguliers et on peut rester pour jaser aussi longtemps qu'on veut sans se faire harceler.  Point boni: les chiens sont admis sur la terrasse l'été."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast with my gf and we were quite disappointed. We ordered an omelet and it was cold. The potatoes that came with the omlet were also cold.  The coffee was relatively hot. It wasn't worth the $30 that's for sure. I could have made a better breakfast myself in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"One of the only restaurants I've ever been to where the pictures on the menu were exactly how your order is presented.  It was very reasonably priced, the food was very good and plentiful, and the staff was friendly and quick.   We didn't feel like we were being shoved out of the place, even though we were tired and taking our sweet time shoveling down breakfast and coffee.   Walking distance from our crappy hotel :-) Good times!"}
{"text":"Usually l'oeufrier is great but this one had awful service on a Sunday at brunch. Took 20 minutes just to put our order in and our waitress didn't come to see us once, food arrived warm if that and it took another 10 to get the bill. Really awful service but at least the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"With so many wonderful breakfast options in Montreal it is hard to find a place that you want to come again and again but l'Oeufrier has done that for me. For a simple reason too: fresh ingredients served in good portions for an appropriate price. May not be the location you want to take a date to impress their foodie senses but definitely a good location for a brunch with friends or family. Food is good--everyone in my party was satisfied, fruits were especially fresh and tasty, eggs were eggcellently done (sorry cannot help), and servers were very helpful, friendly, and polite. What I also appreciate is the diversity in their menu which allows even picky eaters in your company to find a meal, which is very important for me.   Must add that interior in this particular location was also very spacious and we did not feel crammed up like one does in some of the well-known breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Très bons déjeuners. Service très courtois.  Il y a souvent une file d'attente à l'extérieur mais du café est offert pour aider à patienter (très apprécié)."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I go take my breakfast there. The service is quick, there is diversity in the menu and the waiters are nice and smiley. The food is fresh and its not expansive.   Je ne suis jamais déçue quand je vais prendre mon déjeuner là-bas. Le service est rapide, il y a un menu bien diversifié et les serveurs sont gentils et souriants. La nourriture est fraîche et les prix sont vraiment très correcte."}
{"text":"The breakfast was good. However it was the first place where the waiter asked (sic!) for the tips."}
{"text":"Always good food, good portions, coffee is good too! Definitely try the smoothies! And the breakfast poutines are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Damn ,   What an amazing brunch.  I had le st-Laurent poutine , which was amazing. This is because both cheese were melting along the smoke meat, which was a really unique taste. As for the fries aka freaking amazing HOMEMADE POTATOES they are to die for. The eggs on top just adds extra points :p   My gf had Patati Patata, and she loved it. The portion were huge enough and the bread that came along with it from Moisson was amazing.  It's definitely a good brunch place, clean and in a good neighbourhood l. Service is excellent, although it was not really busy at the time I came .  4 stars out of 5 , because 5 stars for me is really hard to give !!"}
{"text":"I came here relatively early Sunday. It was quiet and we sat by the windows, really liked the atmosphere. Food was really filling, i got a Portuguese omelette, lasted me through the day hiking Parc Mont Royal. I also tried some of my brother's breakfast poutine....and it was damn good. Kinda wished i had gotten it as well. The Nutella banana crepe that came with my dad's breakfast was awesome as well. It was actually quite funny that the waiter knew my mom was gonna ask for a cup of hot water. Guess they've met middle aged Asian customers before haha. Def recommend this place for a very good breakfast."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Where to start?? Coffee below unacceptable!  Adding freshly cut bananas, tiny bits of kiwi, and paper thin strawberries to a small bowl of commercially processed pineapple and melons, doesn't make it \"Fresh Seasonal Variety of Fruits\" as it states in the menu.  At $12.50, I think the so called platter, should be served in a dish bigger that something your'd serve escargot in.  I almost gave them a 3-star as service wasn't too bad but then noticed the lady next to me.  She also ordered the fruit platter which was nowhere near what I received.  Her plate had grapefruit, oranges, slices of watermelon and more.  The menu only had the one option when it came to the fruit platter, that I could see.  The server did not extend or made suggestion when I told him I only wanted fruit only for breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my very first meal in my first trip in Montreal, and I was super impressed!   We came in at around 2PM, so you can imagine how hungry we were. :) I got crepes with fresh fruits and my boyfriend ordered one of their bigger breakfasts. My order was delicious -- the fruits (which included blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries) were so fresh. The crepes were a little thicker than any crepe I've tasted in Vancouver, but I liked it that way. My boyfriend also loved his meal and remarked that everything tasted really fresh.  The service here was good. One of the waitresses barely spoke English, but that gave us an opportunity to learn a French word or two.   The prices were a little more than the other places that I've visited in Montreal, but I think it's well worth it. The servings are HUGE, the ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere cool.   If you're near The Village (the gay community in Montreal), you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. They have healthy options from fruit and eggs, all the way to the grease - Montreal poutinee - breakfast style!  The place is packed - don't expect to need your server for 500 questions, or add this add that. They are busy! Also one other factor worth mentioning. They aren't licensed - so no ceasers with breakfast for you!  All in all - Great breakfast spot. Would go again"}
{"text":"I love l'oeufrier! I usually go there about once week with my girlfriend, we always get good service. There is sometime a line-up but it's worth the wait! I recommend their breakfast poutine, even the 30$ one if you are with a friend! The price is great for the quality of the food! Lots of options for shakes and smoothies! There is always a parking spot available, the place is clean. Try it, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"Eggcellent! I had the breakfast poutine and it was delicious. Service was fast and courteous. We sat outside and there was plenty of shade.  Well priced.  Also , it was open early which is great for this neighborhood since it seems to not be for early birds ;-). Glad we found this place.  The block this place is on also has some other cool things to check out."}
{"text":"This street was so quiet on a Sunday morning, I just happened to look it up on yelp and when we found it, it was packed inside!  The menu and options for egg dishes and bacon etc is UNBELIEVABLE! I'm only sorry I didn't take a photo of the menu but got so distracted by the options available!  I forget the name but I got a something \"joe\" breakfast.. needless to say whatever you get, it will be delicious!  Everything is photo worthy and the staff keep coming over and topping up the coffee! I got an English breakfast tea (red rose) .. would love to go again next time we visit Montreal"}
{"text":"First time trying out a breakfast/brunch restaurant and I had somewhat high expectations since everyone I knows raves about them so often. The food was pretty good-- I ordered an egg, sausage and blueberry crepe combo. Sausage was a bit salty but it worked well with the potatoes and eggs as they were not very salty which was perfect. I would come back for the blueberry crepe for sure, it was delicious and just looked adorable. The presentation was very appealing and the service was quick and friendly. I'll be back whenever I'm in Montreal again. :)"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here now...in a restaurant that has multiple seats we waited at the door for twenty minutes while everyone talked to each other.  Now we've been waiting 15 minutes for anyone to come even say hello.  This is the most poorly run restaurant in Montreal...the brunch capital of Canada....waitresses are coming around just to tell us they can't serve us.   I'm amazed this restaurant is still in business.  AWFUL DONT GO UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING INVISIBLE  Update:  it's been 41 minutes...just got coffee....still no food"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on a Friday at the recommendation of my frequent-traveler friend.  Really, I owe him big because this place was fabulous.  The place is larger than it looks from the outside with plenty of seating both inside and out.  It was a hot summer day and the patio window was open, so it was just a bit too warm inside, but other than that the atomosphere was great.  And the food!  As far away from Canada as I live, poutine is something of a treat I cant get often.  Naturally, I ordered the breakfast poutine - all the potatoe and cheese curds, but with hollandaise instead of gravy.  Specifically, I had Le Canard - poutine with duck confit, onion, mushroom, and two eggs on top.  The flavors just combine perfectly for a hearty breakfast.  Not a light dish to be sure, but they have plenty on the menu if you are looking for a lighter meal.  Will definately be back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was just OK. The service was terrible. I was seated and not given a menu, and then ignored for a while. There was apparently some miscommunication between the host and my server. I know these things happen, but there was no acknowledgment, and no attempt make things better. The food was decent, nothing special. I had les bleuets - blueberry crêpes,eggs, and a bagel. I liked the location, good people watching outside."}
{"text":"The menu was misleading as to the quality of the food, as is the initial presentation of service to the end of the meal. The whole experience of dining here was just.. A let down.  We came in around 9:45, wasn't very busy. My girlfriend and I were seated quickly and provided coffee while we perused the enormous menu. Beautiful diner style menu, but the food that came from it was decidedly bland.  The chorizo omelet I had was tasteless, as was my lady's poutine. Getting the check was treated with strong resistance from the overstuffed/under friendly waitresses.   Do not recommend, especially at $15 a plate."}
{"text":"Mon resto déjeuner préféré à Montréal! Les serveurs sont sympathiques, les repas généreux et toujours délicieux. Les noms de repas sur le menu nous font toujours rire en plus! Même si je ne suis plus dans le quartier, je fais le détour sans hésitation!"}
{"text":"Tout d'abord cet endroit est ordinaire de l'extérieur, mais si mignon de l'intérieur! Le décor est simple et urbain. Lorsque nous y sommes allés, il y avait plusieurs familles avec leurs petits et le resto semblait bien équipé pour les accueillir. Le menu est certainement le plus de ce resto. Les choix sont presque infini! Mention spécial au choix impressionnant de milkshake :) J'ai choisi l'omelette Alex, roi de St-Henri. Elle était excellente! Les assiettes sont cuisinées rapidement et elles sont énormes. Avis aux petits appétit, vous voudriez peut-être prendre une plus grosse assiette et la partager. Le seul bémol est que les prix sont un peu élevés pour un resto déjeuner. Pour terminer, ce resto est vraiment un petit bijou sur la rue Chabanel :)"}
{"text":"Despite how small this location is, and the line that might form...generally you will be seated pretty quickly. The potatoes/hash browns are amazing! Myself and my friend ate all of them right up. Cooked well & not too salty! also, lets talk about my apple and brie crepe. Crepe was more of an Eggy feel--which i loved, and the consistancy was on point. It was not too thick, but thick enough to be a blanket to hold in the pear and brie cheese. It was filling, but i didnt slip into a coma. Also the prices are perfect for every dish here--and seems everyone was getting a big serving."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 star breakfast joint. Nothing to write home about, but no frills and decent quality when you need your morning eggs, meat and coffee fix. Yeah it's a chain, albeit a small one. But it's one of the only breakfast places in the area that's not a complete greasy dive (and we all knows there's a time and place for those), has a good amount of decent breakfast options, and surprisingly fast and efficient service when I visited. We ordered some complex items and nothing was messed up and we had our food in just under fifteen minutes (yeah, we timed it) on a busy Sunday morn. Oh, and bonus points for the summer terrace."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch before heading back to Toronto. There was no line when we got in, so we were able to get a seat right away.   Their menus were full of different breakfast items (french toast, omelettes, egg benedicts, etc.). I got the waffles with bananas and strawberries and they were really good. Their bacon, potato, and toasts were like most other breakfast places, so no complains there either. Overall we all enjoyed our food.   Reason for 4 stars is that the service took REALLY long.. from the time we ordered our food, it took them almost 30 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, big portions and a great atmosphere. No complaints at all.   There was a 20-30 wait around noon on a Saturday so the owner had set up a thermos of coffee to stay warm while we waited. A small point but the mark of a restaurant that cares about their clients and puts thought into every detail."}
{"text":"J'adore!  C'est LÀ place  où aller pour bruncher,  le menu est si varie qu'il est bien difficile de faire un choix!  Les milkshakes et smoothies sont délicieux! Par contre, les nouveaux milkshakes avrc une gaufres dessus sont décevant...la gaufre était  molle contrairement à celles servies dans les assiettes. Les repas avec Nutella sont un délice tout comme la guedille au chorizo et fromage de chèvre servi avrc poutine  déjeuné!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant- difficult to pick one thing off menu- potatoes were the best! Milkshakes were great! Service efficient! Definitely will go back when in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"We took the greyhound to Montreal and was looking for brunch places near the station. This place has a great selection of food, from Egg Benedict to Crepe/Waffles. Most of their service staff only speak french and the menu is in french, this can be inconvenient but could also be part of the great experience!"}
{"text":"When it comes to being ahead of the trend, I get the sense that Montreal likely lead the way on the gourmet over the top breakfast/brunch trend in Canada, and Toronto/GTA (while amazing) is still catching up.   While in town for Osheaga this summer we popped into this restaurant based on a strong Yelp average but limited pictures and reviews. A roll of the dice but in the end a Great choice.   Cool rustic vibe, a mix of high and low top tables, and a massive menu that will make the most decisive person feel the pangs of FOMO.   Our wait time was next to nothing (5 minutes while they reset the table) and then we began the arduous process of figuring out what to eat.   They've got your staples on lock down, and because it's Montreal almost every meal comes with huge portions of fruit and maybe a sweet crepe.   Oh and they have crepes (sweet and savoury), French toast, waffles, different varieties of eggs Benny and THEN you get into the anytime of day items with a breakfast twist like the grilled cheeses.   For drinks they've got the standard juices, coffee, specialty coffees, and teas. But then they throw you for a loop with a menu of smoothies that rival their food menu in delicious and tempting.   My classic fat guy move when faced with indecisiveness at a restaurant is to basically order the biggest meal that comes with the most stuff so I can try a bit of everything.   That choice was the Gros Gourmand which came with eggs, numerous kinds of meat, fruit, amazing potatoes and of course a sweet crepe. F*ck me. Its days like this where I wonder how picky eaters survive and how I survive without getting a coronary. Every bite was delicious and I finished every bite - not messing around here.   Sachi (the fiancée) had the veggie grilled cheese and she was not disappointed at all. I had a bite and it was, as the kids say, lit/live.   This is a growing Quebec chain as I understand it but they manage to keep that small independent business feel in the quality of their food and level of their service. I'm a fan. Please open a location in the GTA soon.   Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Service was great, coffee was delicious and always full.  Breakfast poutine is a must and the 30 dollar one is amazing! Extremely satisfied and will be returning. Great portions great prices!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place for brunch! The menu is extensive, with many egg-based unusual dishes. The patatis dishes were extremely interesting: omelettes on top of potatoes at gratin, served with a side of  bread and fruit. I tried the 'Athena et sa bande' patati - eggs with feta cheese, olives (yup, the real thing, not the black canned ones!!!), tomatoes, oregano and potatoes at gratin, topped with melted cheese. I asked for my Benedict sauce on the side. I really love that dish, and will try to recreate at home. My friend tried the patati 'Marco demenage a Lisbon', which included delicious pieces of chorizo. Something different for brunch, to be sure!   Spying on tables around us, we couldn't help but notice the variety of crepes, sandwiches, omelettes and drinks served. The menus has an impressive selection of smoothies and milkshakes. Service is fast, people are friendly, the place has a clean and modern look and feel... Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We eat here often, always with kids, and they never disappoint. Portions are good, especially after a long run, and the service is usually fast. Will we be back? You betcha"}
{"text":"Its the best breakfast restaurant in the west island. Huge portions and the food tastes amazing. Service is good and friendly. Any one saying otherwise is a liar. Awesome milkshakes and smoothies. You have got to try it."}
{"text":"We walked in at 6am on a weekday and there were many locals dining. The main server (likely owner) Michel, seemed to know everyone.   Great coffee. My husband enjoyed his strawberry banana smoothy. You could literally taste how fresh the fruit was inside. Had I been hungrier, I would have went with one of their many egg Benedict specials. Instead  I got two eggs poached with crepes and a side of Montreal bagel. Loved the side of fruit and their fries. The crepe was good but could have been a lot more lighter.  ***Food came relatively quick, good service.   ***free coffee refills.   ***Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing! It's a nice cool spot and they have multiple locations around Québec. You can't go wrong with this place.   This place is exactly what you'd expect from a breakfast spot.  The portions size is generous which is a plus.   Service was okay but quick. I don't think the waitress liked that I answered her back in English every time  I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of breakfast plates. But on top of that, if you are the Saturday/Sunday morning brunch expert, you will love this place for several reasons: 1) their \"2 eggs + bacon + sausage\" is the most affordable in the area. 2) their sausages are the tastiest and biggest in the area 3) they have flexible \"2 eggs + 2 choices\" selection which actually include pancakes as a choice 4) you can switch out the potatoes on the side for more fruit - at no extra cost 5) in the summer they have a terrace. 6) they have 3 different flavours of Tabasco sauce. 7) their plates include bread from Premiere Moisson - which is a high end local bread shop."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The portions are generous so you definitely won't leave hungry. I had the breakfast poutine with 3 different types of sausage, including chorizo. The potatoes are also one of the best I've ever tried for a breakfast restaurant. Come early if you want to eat here as it gets packed quickly"}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and were in the mood for crepes. This place has a huge brunch menu and we ended up getting crepes plus more! Everything was delicious, huge portion sizes."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, trendy, tasty brunch food. My friend had the breakfast poutine and was in love with it! Is a little pricey but absolutely worth it! I had a spin on a grilled cheese, absolutely mouth watering. lastly my friend and I tried a crepe which was HUGE and amazing for dessert!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable, le personnel est vraiment sympathique et ils semblen tous aimer leur travail et j'admets que c'est plutôt rare de voir des gens qui aiment autant leur travail.  l'emplacement est par contre un peu petit et le stationnement est insuffisant."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Food was good. Crepes weren't the best, but overall it's a great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch place! Coffee came with entrees. Yummy omelette and crepes. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant de déjeuner avec un menu très original !  Je suis arrêté dans ce petit resto par hasard, car je devais déjeuner dans le coins et j'ai été bien surpris !  Leurs choix d'oeuf bénédictine et de grill cheese sont très varier. De plus, leur milk shakes sont excellent !   Je vais retourné à l'oeufrier c'est certaine !   Le service etait excelent aussi !"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have to write a poor review for a restaurant in my own neighbourhood! This afternoon, I went into l'Ouefrier with my daughter. We arrived at 2:20, and since the restaurant closes at 3pm (as advertised on the door), I asked the owner if our timing was okay. Another table was being served, and he said yes. We ordered our food and it arrived quickly. At 2:30, my daughter noticed a smell of chlorine and the mop came out. The tables were moved, hitting the back of my daughter's chair, and the mop was used by our feet.  Alarmed, I asked our waitress (who was lovely) to pack our food, that we could take it home.  The owner ignored my comment and continued to rearrange the salt shakers on nearby tables. When I got the nerve, I asked him why had he not told us that the timing was not right, and that he would be mopping within 10 minutes of our arrival? He was rude, told me that he recognized me, and knew that  my family and I were patrons over the last three years, and that I should know \"the rules\". Ha! It's written 3pm on his door, I reminded him. He replied \"everybody is OUT by 3\", \"I don't want to pay overtime\".  I explained that I was shocked at his behavior and the way he was speaking to me- and how outrageous to be so disrespectful in front of my daughter. He asked me what I wanted from him? I responded that an apology would have been good, or even to offer to move us to the back of the restaurant, and if not, offer a discount on our meal. He responded that they don't make enough money for that. So I gave the waitress a big tip (cash), paid for the remainder of the lunch on Visa and left their establishment. He was rude, interrupting, and careless-  Needless to say, they will never see me or my family again.."}
{"text":"J'ai découverts cet endroit au début de l'été et c'était vraiment prometteur! Malheureusement les deux dernières fois ont été des expériences très ordinaires, j'hésite à y retourner. J'ai retourné une omelette immangeable qui goutait \"le frigo\", complètement insipide avec des légumes froids tout juste sortis du frigo dans des oeufs pas assaisonnés. On m'a rapporté des oeufs bénédictines sans rajouter l'accompagnement (au moins les patates), c'était sec, les oeufs n'étaient pas bons. Mon corps a évacué tout cela de façon expéditive! Il y avait manifestement quelque chose de pas bon dans ces oeufs...par contre la serveuse a été très accommodante et compréhensive, rien à redire. La deuxième expérience est anecdotique, je voulais m'arrêter prendre un smoothie à emporter pour marcher jusqu'au gym (les jus et smoothies sont excellents), j'ai bien sûr demandé si c'était possible à emporter, on m'a fait payer, puis on m'a apporté mon smoothie séparé dans deux tasses à café à emporter, le tout dans un cabaret.... Heu... Comment dire... Alors j'hésite et c'est dommage parce que c'est à côté de chez moi!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this spot for breakfast. I had the brioche with Nutella and my wife had the poutine breakfast. I really enjoyed mine but she thought it was a bit heavy. The opposite was true of her dish.   The atmosphere was great for breakfast and the server was wonderful. No complaints about anything."}
{"text":"Good service,  and they had decaf coffee ready (not instant or lattes only like most MTL places); toast was excellent, but the eggs, potatoes,  and pancake were just \"ok\". \"Fruit\" was laughable, more like garnish."}
{"text":"A great place to stop for breakfast. The menu is ginormous. They have gluten-free options and can sub out any toast or bagel for gluten free."}
{"text":"La place sera toujours quand même pleine, mais en aucun cas ça devrait vous décourager d'y aller. Le staff est gentil, courtois et à l'écoute des clients. Vous partirez pas de la en ayant faim car les portion sont généreuses."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town and wanted to grab a bite with them, but they had three kids so we needed a family-friendly spot, and L'oeufrier did the trick. Maybe not the best Montreal has to offer, but good in a crunch. Quality food, large portions. I had the Portuguese sausage benny which had either goat cheese or ricotta sprinkled on top of it, and it was solid. And for what it's worth, my friends actually commented that this was the best spot they ate at during their trip. The service was super accommodating and patient. Probably wouldn't go here alone but definitely with a group."}
{"text":"Went to Laval for a large family outing and decided on this place for brunch. Luckily, we made reservations (and arrived on the earlier side), so we didn't wait too long for our seats. The ambience felt new and bustling, the servers were sweet and helpful (English menus available, just ask!), and of course, the food was amazing. I went for one of the breakfast poutines (basically has hollandaise instead of gravy, and is topped with a fried egg, as well as other unique fixins). Safe to say the portions here are huge, so prepare to take half of your meal home (or share!). My partner had one of the half-waffle with egg combos, which was also tasty. I think her waffle was topped with fruit and Nutella. Anyways, while I don't see myself coming here regularly, I definitely would come back on a special occasion or with a group of friends and family."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I found this place to be good. It was definitely a step up from your Chez Cora type place, but nothing was fantastic. The food was fresh and tasty, portions big (including the side fruit portions which were huge - very unusual). Nice enough, bright atmosphere with friendly service. Tables are close together so think twice before going with a baby in a stroller (as we did). Because it was so early and empty, they were able to accommodate and make space, though.   I should also mention that the menu was quite extensive. I'd say because we're in the neighbourhood, we'd go back, but wouldn't travel far for it."}
{"text":"Endroit très classique pour un brunch...mais o combien apprécié! Si apprécié en fait, que vous trouverez chaque samedi et dimanche une line up plus ou moins importante...mais quand même!  Ce brunch à un succès fou et il faudra à tous les coups vous armez de patience pour avoir la chance d'y goûter! L'endroit est tout le temps bondé mais tellement familial et chaleureux..que peu importe l'attente!  Vous aurez à faire un choix très difficile parmi leurs innombrables propositions de brunch...et de même pour les boissons!  Il y en a pour tous les goûts et chaque appétit serait satisfait et rassasié! Alors courrez l'essayer!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! I really wanted to try the Mac and cheese skillet, but they were out of cheese the day I was in town. I got an alternate skillet along with an oreo shake and both were delicious! The staff were all super friendly, we had a month old puppy with us who was allowed in and all the food was AMAZING! Definitely planning a trip back to try the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Delicioso lugar, platillos muy bastos y con gran sabor. De los mejores desayunos que he probado."}
{"text":"I stopped by this spot for breakfast on the first day of my trip to Montreal. The food was so good that I ended up coming here 2 more times during my 4 day trip. The service was quick and extremely friendly, providing excellent recommendations.   They have a large menu filled with several great options. From bagels and benedicts to omelettes and everything in between. I went with the P'tit Gourmand breakfast platter. This platter came with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, nutella crepe and fruit. Every single item on my plate was absolutely delicious. Everyone at my table was equally impressed with what they got. So seems like you can't go wrong with anything you order off their menu!"}
{"text":"Really good menu, lots of choices. Big omelettes served with delicious, crispy potatoes, and toast. Their fresh squeezed juices are fantastic! The crepes and pancakes looked delicious although I didn't try them. The food comes out super fast! You leave full and satisfied. Solid breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Came here here for brunch/lunch on Christmas because it was really the only thing open in the area. It's very typical diner food. It's very lovely a quite inside and that's why it gets 4 stars. The servers are very sweet and helpful. The food was average and didn't have a ton of flavor, but wasn't bad. I ordered the breakfast poutine and the potatoes were cooked well but the hollandaise sauce had very little flavor, as did the cheese curds. My mother also commented that her smoked salmon had very little flavor as well. My Dad enjoyed his waffles topped with a mountain of peanut butter, nutella, and bananas. My husbands grilled cheese was fine but nothing spectacular. I also ordered a strawberry and kiwi smoothie, which was the highlight for me. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"L'Oeufrier is just past the super bustling stretch of Mont Royal, and was a nice place to have breakfast before disembarking on a long day. We fueled up on ONE order of eggs/sausages/bacon, which came with a side of fruit, a huge chocolate/banana crepe, and a buttery basket of toast that satisfied us both.  Bright clean space, friendly staff, quick service, fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great (and funny) menu items. Good taste, large portions and very friendly service. Would have been back if they didn't close at 3..."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had in my life. Not very expensive for an authentic French meal. Menu is in French but easy to understand. Lots of variety on the menu and excellent wait staff. Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"The French toast with fruit was absolutely delicious. The food was really good and the value was good as well. Service was great, friendly staff and they were willing to speak English for us. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"After being dismayed that our mainstay pre-departure breakfast wouldn't be able to happen because Olive + Gourmando was closed, we decided to try out this L'Ouefrier.  Man, we weren't disappointed. The amount of food for the price is crazy, and the food is freshly made. Not to mention our server was the nicest person in the entire world. Seriously. She should probably get an award or something.  Want a quick, good, filling (as in \"you don't need to eat for the rest of the day\") breakfast? Go here."}
{"text":"So much food! I got the two eggs pick two sides option and could barely eat half of it there was so much. For sides I chose french toast and sausage. The french toast was amazing, moist and just the right amount of crisp on the edges. The sausage was good but not a stand out. The potatoes you could either get crispy rounds or mashed with onions OR BOTH! I clearly went for both because variety is the spice of life. I liked mixing them together but both tasted good on their own! Also the bread came from a local bakery and I got the multigrain and it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Cela fait la deuxième fois que j'y vais et que je trouve que c'est cher pour ce que j'ai dans mon assiette. J'ai trouvé que ce que j'ai mangé manquais de goût. Comme si ça les éléments était juste cuit puis servis sur table. Ce n'est pas mauvais, mais pas bien non plus dans ma bouche.  Mis à part le milk shake vanille, banane et beurre de peanuts."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and I've had a great experience every visit. The staff is super friendly and comfortable speaking English. I know how hard it is for someone to constantly switch mentally back and forth between French and English,  but they always remember who speaks what and give great service.   Breakfast is always fresh and huge portions.  Word of warning , anything with hollandaise will be swimming in it. Which I, personally, am more than okay with.   Lots of space for seating but it's never overly crowded. (busy enough not to worry about freshness)   Def a great place for breakfast with a friend or the family."}
{"text":"We went for a late weekday brunch. The restaurant was busy and the noise level & ambience was good. The food is excellent, the eggs Benedict were particularly good. The portions are large, really nobody at our table could finish their plate. Service is attentive without being intrusive.  The coffee is great."}
{"text":"time: busy lunchtime on a holiday. fast seating, crowded space, constant coffee, delicious omelets. fresh veggies in the omelet and fruit on the side with fantastic toast! with raisins! i thought about asking for hot sauce (for the omelet, of course), but if i figured that would be uncouth. the servers were busy but got everything right on time. this place is really a deal."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast, had an omelette with a bagel that deserved better and fries on the side that were ok as well."}
{"text":"So, I've finally signed up for Yelp because I'm tired of shitty fucking waiters getting away with the shitty fucking service they give and the money they're still allowed to walk away with. This is my first review and as a seasoned waiter myself, I'm seriously appalled. L'oeufrier Amherst; so noisy that I had to repeat my order not once but 3 times the 3rd time practically yelling at the guy who then proceeded to ask me with major attitude if \"I\" was okay...? Are you kidding me... My eggs were over cooked, my potatoes were cold he offered mayo but no coffee refill when he clearly should have noticed that our cups were empty when offering the mayo!? And when the fuck did servers stop asking if everything is to our liking?! You can't event take 2 seconds?! I'm sick and tired of tipping assholes! Thank you to his colleague for the second cup of coffee.   Usually I don't say anything, leave my 15% and walk out. Well buddy, because you thought I was giving you attitude (when I clearly wasn't) and you decided right then and there that you weren't going to serve us anymore, today you're getting 10 fucking percent and if I was a real asshole I'd leave you nothing. I wasn't in a bad mood when I sat down but I'm annoyed as fuck now. It's because of people like you who continually get away with shitty service that more and more people are deciding to stay home instead of dinning out!!!  *L'oeufrier on Mt-Royal has way better service, and better atmosphere even when it's packed to the brim!"}
{"text":"The food was good and came out fast, but our server seemed disinterested as she seemed preoccupied with \"regulars\" and we had to wait to order while others were seated after us.  Seems like she picked up on our dissatisfaction and another server jumped in later.  I still left a 20% tip, but it was a less than pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast so many choices on the menu had a hard time deciding before settling on banana strawberry nutella crepe with egg, sausage, potatoes and bacon. Delicious!!! Worth the wait outside."}
{"text":"Nous avons tous les 3 étaient très satisfaits de notre brunch à l'Oeufrier! J'avais lu de mauvais commentaires sur cette chaîne de restos et finalement ils se sont tous avérés faux en ce qui concerne mon expérience! Les plats étaient très copieux et très bons (nous avons pris des classiques, certes..), le service très agréable, et c'est parfait pour un budget en bas de 20$. Bref, je le recommande vraiment! A savoir, celui sur Ahmerst n'est pas très grand, alors c'est mieux d'arriver à 10h pour être sûr d'avoir une table, et à 6 personnes max. je dirais."}
{"text":"This was our first brunch place in Montreal and def would come back again :) If you don't speak french make sure to ask for english menu. I love that the brunch dishes come with both potatoes and various fruits. Their \"home-fries\" were more similar to french fries but in cut round sausage shapes. I would say their potatoes were exceptional and unlike anything else I've ever had. Everyone in my table liked my dish--chorizo goat cheese eggs benedict. if that sounds appealing to you, MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"It's a great little breakfast/lunch chain. We were there early (7 am) as we were taking my brother in law to an appointment in the area so we snuck in for a quick bite. Lovely long restaurant with the familiar decor of the chain, very clean. Extremely nice waitress, fast service both from her and from the kitchen, great little breakfast (we got the early bird special - complete breakfast for $5.75, so that's a great deal). I would absolutely go again if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm not much a fan of eggs however I'm glad I didn't judge this brunch location simply by their name!  This has got to be my favourite brunch restaurant that I've been to in Montréal or anywhere else for that matter.   Location: only a few blocks from Crémazie Métro Station and a few minutes of a TransCanada Hwy exit if you're coming from afar. However this restaurant clearly is representing for the residents of Villeray.   Atmosphere: with a bright a fairly large dining area it easy to notice the popularity of this place as it still seems full inside. However don't let that discourage you if you're looking for a quite brunch because it didn't get loud in there. It seems it attracts an respectful crowd of people or maybe sound just doesn't travel much in there. In addition to the indoor dining area, there is a covered patio that allows a lot of sunshine in plus there are heaters well positioned to separate you from the Montréal winter.   Food: First of all, they have english menus so that's a big plus for us Anglophones who are visiting. The menu was stacked with egg inspired dishes however there was still a number of options for anyone who might not be a fan of eggs (or am I the only one?).  I ordered a Tuna Grilled Cheese Sandwich with the pan fries & Caesar salad. This comes with coffee or herbal tea and a dessert. I must say that the Caesar salad was pretty amazing. For my personal taste maybe it could have used a bit more dressing but the croutons were perfect and it had real piece bacon in it. As for the sandwich, I think a bit more cheese would have made the it to die for but really no complaints. It was perfectly grilled and tuna was of a good texture.   Staff: Despite how busy it was, they were quick to take our order and serve the food. And each waiter/waitress on the floor kept an eye on each table. While we did have a main waiter, often the others stepped up to satisfy our concerns or questions. There was never a time where we felt we were waiting on them. Great work team!  Overall: I happy to be spending my time in the Villeray community of Montréal and I hope to visit this place again for brunch before I leave. Next time I'll be sure to try one their smoothies."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast brioche which was great. The free coffee makes the place amazing for a filling breakfast without spending too much. The smoothies are very good as well."}
{"text":"Pour un brunch le WE, mieux vaut réserver car ça a l'air très plein entre 10h et 14h Nous avions réservé pour 6 avec un bébé, et nous avons eu une très belle table Le gérant était très sympa et arrangeant, et il est rapide et efficace, ce qui donne l'impression qu'ils font tout pour servir au mieux les clients (ce qui n'est pas le cas de toutes les places comme on le sait tous...) Large choix de brunchs, il y en a pour tous les goûts, et il y a même des options végé, sans gluten, sans lactose, etc.. Demandez! Nous avons passé un très bon moment et y retournerons probablement!"}
{"text":"Awesome little breakfast place. Bright and friendly staff. And a lot of different menu items. Particularly lived all the different grilled cheese sandwiches. It's the kind of place you just have to go back to more than once cause there's other dishes you want to try. This place is definitely my new go-to Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Small location in the gay village. Their menu is extensive, various choices and combos available, and all the plates had pretty funny names. Portions are big, you are sure to fill up your belly if you come in hungry. However, in my book, breakfast being a pretty easy meal to prepare, a good brunch restaurant really differentiates itself from the attention they pay to details. Some examples that I found disappointing might include : waffle was not crispy (more of a pancake texture), potatoes were not freshly made and had no seasoning on them, and service was lacking (no coffee refill, server kind of our meal), and the bread was definitively not freshly toasted as it was hard and cold like if it was left on the counter for a whole day. We waited outside for about 50 minutes on a Sunday morning so I definitively had higher expectations for this place. Price point reasonable, around what you would expect to pay elsewhere downtown, but definitively not cheap. Would go back to try other things on the menu, but perhaps not at this location."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such low ratings. L'Oeufrier is a completely reasonable breakfast joint. They serve all the fan favourites with a few special dishes. They have a variety of milkshakes and smoothies. I have tried a few options and was satisfied with the meal each time. The services is all over the place, but not annoying enough to affect your meal."}
{"text":"Went this morning with the wife and kids, everyone loved it. Great menu, lots of selection with over the top trendy plates to choose from. Service was good. Ambiance is nice and the place is not too big like many other places where it gets crazy busy and loud. Prices are same as other bfast places. I would recommend and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"beau bon pas cher! Toujours frais , le service est normalement très rapide , je ne manque jamais de café! Les noms des déjeuner sont très rigolos , et je m'en sors normalement en dessous de 20$ avec le service c'est très raisonnable! Seul bémol leurs chaises sont des chaises de patio extérieur, donc un peu étrange et pas très confortable... le proprio devrais les changr!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars A great brunch place. However, it does get busy and crowded and they aren't adapted for the demand. When I went with my boyfriend we got a table placed in front of the kitchen exit, which was unfortunate because it was probably the worst table in the restaurant. There were also a few flies flying around which is really unpleasant.   The food was better than I expected. It was also served fast which is a plus."}
{"text":"Wow! We were visiting from NY -- here for a hockey tournament and just happened on this place. Fantastic food; gracious service; terrific for kids/families. I don't ever post reviews on YELP but my sone and I truly loved this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool brunch place, but possibly a bit over-hyped?  I came with a group of 12 people. We booked ahead and didn't have to stand in line (not a fan of lines, and they have one on weekends!). Our table wasn't completely ready for our 11 o'clock reservation - they had a table for 8 reserved and waited for the party next to us to finish in order to add a couple of extra tables (about 20-25 minutes later).  This wasn't a problem because we had latecomers in our group, but otherwise it would suck.   We also had a coupon from restomontreal.com for a 15% discount (valid with a group reservation of 4 people or more, I called ahead to make sure it would be accepted).  They said there was no way it applies for everyone - just for one person. I politely said that it is pretty straight forward - the waiter went to check, and long story short they agreed to accept it for one bill (that is, we couldn't split the bill, one of us had to pick it up and collect money from everyone else). Whatever... We ended up saving $30 (kinda like ~two free meals). Not too shabby, but they could have probably done it in a more friendly manner (and waste less time over it).  The service was OK otherwise. We were approached for coffee refills once during service (and weirdly enough again when the bill arrived and we were ready to leave). I was fine with just one refile, but I know some like more...  The food: good, not great, on the expensive side, but dishes are huge (most people didn't finish). I am one to  usually finish whatever is put in front of me, but I couldn't! I guess it might be because I didn't particularly like the hollandaise sauce on my breakfast poutine.  The orange juice was fresh! It was fun because the company was great, but I probably won't come back.  Other places in the Plateau will have better bang for your buck, most likely better service, and possibly honor their own coupons (or at least avoid issuing them)."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour déjeuner.  Les tables sont rapproché, ce n'est donc pas la place pour un tête à tête, mais pour un déjeuner original et et savoureux, c'est la place ! Il y a aussi une grande sélection de smootie. Par contre, ce n'est pas l'endroit pour ceux qui aime le bon thé (c'est du Salada)."}
{"text":"Great place not have brunch open until 3pm and conveniently locayed through out montreal. Friendly server and quick orders. They also have kids menu for the little ones. Nice atmosphere and lights and music. Not too crowed or noisy. We ordered the brioche french toast for the kids and they love it amd for us we have a better french toast in the past . For myself is the meat omellete the meat not over powering the egg. The medalian fried coulds use a little salt. But my wife enjoy her egg benedict and the hollandise sauce that come with it along with their fresh fruits. The juices kids love it. Will visit again some other time fot another brunch."}
{"text":"Decided to go for brunch on a very cold day and Yelp helped me find a brunch place not to far from Beaudry metro. This cute little resto offers a wide variety of breakfast options. My friend and I were overwhelmed with the delicious pictures of food but I finally chose the \"Patati: Sao par sur le party\". Two eggs mixed with potatoes, cheese, spinich, tomatoes, mushrooms etc... It was a generous portion served with a side of fruit and bread. My friend had one of their waffles with potatoes and fruit. Our food coma was evidence of a good experience. Everything was really good and despite it being packed the service was fast. Definitely returning to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast restaurants I've ever been to.  Amazing quality of food with remarkable service.  We went on Sunday when the line was out the door.  Every table packed and staff maintained a pleasant unrushed affect.  Portions are huge and beautiful presentation.   Went back on Monday when less busy.  Same server who remembered our beverage choice from the previous day. How did she do that?  Wish they had this place in DC."}
{"text":"Four stars. The walkway at the entrance was way too slippery. The restaurant is quite small and there was a wait by the door so standing there was a bit uncomfortable. Aside from that, the food was delicious!!!! I had an omelette with the thin crepe and hollandaise sauce wrapped around it. So good! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. Staff was fantastically accommodating. They were concerned about where they sat us, if we had enough space and if we were pleased with it. Server was friendly and helpful with the menu. It isn't cheap but the ingredients were fresh, coffee was hot and the selection was fantastic. Add in the Montreal menu references that abound and it was an excellent experience that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a week day mid morning, because of other yelpers raving about it. But seeing where they are situated, my expections weren't high. Boul. Des Laurentides isn't a renown place for fine dining. More for groceries and strip clubs. I like booths but the only ones they have here are in the back where everybody was hiding. Other than that the place was quite empty. Waitress had to clean our dirty table, I guess she had been busy doing nothing. Neighbors were quite loud, decor is average,  with TVs hanging underneath dirty ceiling tiles...   OK. Food. Had the breakfast poutine.  Fries seemed to have been cooked a week ago and re-heated: very dry and hard to chew. The smoked salmon looked and tasted very old. My plate doesn't come with fruits but my friends fruits were all hard and tasteless.   Why  am I in this dump? Surrounded by old people and cops?  Probably would be better off at Chez Cora, Eggstyle, or even Belle Province up the street.  Never again."}
{"text":"The choice on the menu is crazy! I can't believe how many grilled cheese choices there can be, eggs Benedict, waffles, omelettes, crepes, poutines, Mac & cheeses and combo plates.  With all that choice it's hard to decide on one. I had a duck confit Mac & cheese with a sunny side up egg on top. Wow!  Perfect amount of cheese, noodles weren't soggy and the green onion slices on top gave a fresh taste with every bite. And the duck was very decadent. At 18.50 it was worth it.  All the names on the menu are very funny. My late was called \"les nouveaux riches de Napierville\"  highly recommend. The coffee on the other hand is bland. But most breakfast joints serve Café Brossard. If they upgraded the coffee it would be 5 star."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal and thought the service was great.My only problem was the bathroom was a bit dirty and needed toilet tissue.The floors had food crumbs as well.I will also say that they were cleaning as I was leaving so they was getting to it."}
{"text":"First impression was great, as we waited in line to get a table we were greeted with shots of their yummy fresh pressed orange juice! As we get inside, I can see it's a buzzing (tight quartered) spot. They have a whole line of fresh smoothies and juices, and a lovely menu broadening from breakfast-brunch-lunch items for everyone. I had a patati with assorted French vegetables and smothered in Swiss cheese, aaand a side of hollandaise. Amazing! Paired with a bagel and a nice fresh fruit bowl. I will definitely be hitting this place up the next time I am in Montreal :) maybe next time for a crepe."}
{"text":"The place is quite small and there are a couple of tables too many to make it completely comfortable and room for the waiters to pass out. The smoothies are delicious. The breakfast potatoes were so salty that I felt like I was having a salt rush and started to feel like I was going to pass out. The salsa in my husband's Cancun omelette was cold and the sun-dried tomatoes in my Paris omelette were mush. Most of the tables had a glass bottle of water and their coffee or juice, we did not. We asked twice for water. I actually had to get up and go to the waiter station to tell them we were still waiting for water before they finally came back three minutes later to bring us water.  All in all I would not go back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and they never disappoint! Delicious food for every mood (healthy bite to hungover brunch), great little terrace in the sun during summer and excellent service!!"}
{"text":"After trying 2 other spots with ridiculous queues, we ended up at this place and it turned out to be a wonderful decision. I had the Benedict Duck Confit with Mushrooms and my friend had the smoked meat poutine. Our meals not only looked good but they were equally very delicious"}
{"text":"Cute little place,lively, busy ,ambiance; very polite,sweet waiter. I'd passed by earlier in the afternoon, but the place was packed. Came back an hour later, and voila, empty tables available, one just for me by the open, plant and flower filled window, looking out on the little terrace on the scorching sidewalk. I ordered a Mediterranean -style Benedict, which cam with pan roasted potatoes,and I must say, is the best I've had to date, anywhere. I was also very pleasantly surprised that it came with a side of fresh fruit, which I did not notice  written on the menu. Coffee was included, a refill was given without asking, and the service was was prompt and very courteous. I have to say though, this is a bit on the pricey side, but excellent, so it's well worth it. The only slightly, annoying factor, was one of the staff reaching past me several times to refill the sugar container. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Plat de brunch classic, bacon trop cuit, service lamentable et arrogant. Aucun intérêt de dépenser son argent ici."}
{"text":"Great little place for a real breakfast in the Village, as opposed to a coffee shop. I'd read about the lines and the wait times, but arriving not long after they opened, I experienced none of that. The fruit salad is a sampler of a large variety of fruits, and though the breakfast poutines looked interesting I had the house eggs Benedict. This will become by go-to breakfast stop whenever I stay nearby."}
{"text":"Un vaste choix à la carte , un service rapide, des prix abordables et des portions généreuses . Je recommande!"}
{"text":"L'Oeufrier is essentially a diner.  The prices are pretty high for what I would consider diner fare but holy crap their menu is extensive.  Located off of what I would consider a main drag full of various shops, L'Oeufrier provides a very nice ambiance to enjoy your meal while people watching.  Here I learned \"brioche\" actually means to us Americans....a cinnamon roll.  Without the fat ass American way of eating it (that is without the massive amounts of icing dripping off of it).  Although for breakfast it was a bit pricey, I will say the portions were generous and everything was well done.  For what I would consider a quiet Friday morning, there was only one waiter serving the entire restaurant and everything was painfully slow from the food coming out to even getting the check.  All in all though, it's not a bad place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great food huge portions and unique brunch meals. Loved it. Sunny interior. Delightful."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Size was generous.  The servers were pleasant and attentive.  Coffee was refilled without us asking.  Surprisingly, the coffee was great.  The banana Nutella crepe was well made.  Breakfast poutine was just perfect, hollandaise sauce was not too salty.  They have two type of breakfast potatoes:  mashed potatoes with onions and homefries.  I couldn't decide, the server was so nice gave me half and half.  I would come back again!  Update:  went to oeufrier again, this time I had the asparagus ham/cheese Benedict.  I wish the asparagus is served in original stalks, instead of chopped in small pieces.  I am not even sure if it's fresh or canned asparagus.  Also, they put way too much hollandaise sauce, which made the English muffin more musher and soggier if you don't eat your dish fast enough.  My cousin had the breakfast poutine."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. Staff was super polite and friendly. Banana Nutella crepe was crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went this morning with a large group and the food, service and administration was Amazingly accommodating! The plates were not only large but tastefully put together.  This is a must return in my books. ;-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast chain in Montreal. The menue (in french) is so funny I really enjoy going through it. They have a loooot of choices and everything I tried (bagels, omelets, pancakes...) all taste amazing. Also, the staff is super sweet!"}
{"text":"Great bagels and fried potatos; both tasty and substantial. Smoothie was mediocre but it was only $3.5 with the bagel so not a huge letdown. Service was very fast and nice! My friend & I came here for an early brunch at 8:30 so we were the only ones in the restaurant besides 2 other people!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spot I'ved ever had. Me & my bf was looking for brunch spot in montreal & this place was recommended by the crew of second cup coffee shop nearby this restaurant.   So we came here & got a table. A few minutes later theirs a big line outside for people waiting for a table. We got lucky! Yay! They have 2 different types of menu, written in english & french.   For drink I got the manggo, banana & peach smoothies. So refreshing! For food I got the chocogaufe- it is a big plate with bacon, egg, fried potato, fruits & waffles topped with banana, strawberry & nutella. Omg! Delicious! Everything was cooked perfectly. The bacon is crispy, waffles is a little crispy with softness on the inside. Most of the time when me & my bf eat for brunch I always ask for a french toast, pancakes or waffle with fruits & at the same time have some fried stuff, so this plate is exactly what I'm looking for. I never had anything like this in nyc. Its always 2 orders, no combo so I really enjoyed my brunch. My bf got the same thing except that he got crepes instead of waffles & he enjoyed hes meal as well.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Restaurant de déjeuners qui se démarque de tous les autres dans ce créneau. Menu des plus complet et des plus original. Excellente nourriture et service attentionné."}
{"text":"First time there and the service was excellent and the breakfast so good, my mom enjoyed everything, definitely I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is booming. If you have an appetite after a hard weekend then it's the place to be. Very very big portions! Also very elaborate menu. I had the plate with half waffle and my friend had the duck egg Benedict ! I couldn't eat it all. I thought their potatoes were really tasty. The place was full so a tad loud. The service was ok because the waitress was fairly new so she got mixed up here and there. We didn't hold it against her. I'll be back to taste the rest! Apparently they have a great breakfast poutine !"}
{"text":"Breakfast is definitely my favorite meal to go out for and I do..... just about every weekend. Stumbled upon this place randomly driving around the West Island, and I'm so happy I did.  Wow is all I have to say!!! This is my new favorite  breakfast place in Montreal!  The French Toast, Mixed Potatoes and crepe are to die for!  Very fast service, very clean and amazing food. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, mais attendez-vous à de généreuses portions. Le menu est très varié, les oeufs étant la vedette dans la majorité des cas. J'ai bien aimé leur chocolat chaud et leur fruits sont très frais. Côté ambiance, la déco est très belle et la musique très discrète, mais si l'endroit est plein, ça devient vite très bruyant. L'endroit étant assez petit, il ne faut pas s'attendre à beaucoup d'intimité; les tables sont très proches. Je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion d'essayer leurs dîners, mais l'endroit est munie d'un wifi, pratique pour un dîner d'affaire."}
{"text":"L'Oeufrier is a breakfast chain established back in 1995 that is currently quickly expanding in and around Montreal region that I feel that within the next few years will be at the tip of everyone's tongue as the place to go to get a great breakfast much to the likes of Allo Mon Coco is today in Laval.  L'Oeufrier offers a huge variety of breakfast, brunch, lunch grub within a neat and polish little book that will simply make you more hungry than you already were when you walked in. The selection is overwhelming and in a way, blissful as you can come back over and over and try new things.  They have the standard type of breakfasts you can usually get elsewhere, shakes, smoothies, various egg Benedict dishes, omelets, poutine breakfasts?!?, patati patata?!?, grilled cheeses, crepes, waffles, brioches, french toasts... etc. The lunch menu has sandwiches, salads and burgers... all in all, the choices are numerous.  I went with \"Oui, Je Trippe. Which consists of waffles with bananas with a shower of nutella and bacon. It was.... very rich but soooo yummy. Very good!  The coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently.  The price tag is reasonable for what is offered.  Will I come back? Absolutely!!!!   L'Oeufrier... je t'aime."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and when you are in good company it makes for a pleasant experience. Been to this location several times and the quality of food is always good. This is important to me! I respect establishments that are consistent in the food they prepare for their clients. My only request is that they add Mimosas to their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Love the great variety in their menu !  I feel like there's always something interesting to try everytime I go. Would definitely recommend the smoothies, so tasty !"}
{"text":"OMG!!! How awesome!!! The MENU is pretty big but soon or later you decide  THE TASTE WAS STUNNING I really recommend this place!!! I will back very soon."}
{"text":"Holy hell, what a breakfast! This breakfast/lunch restaurant is quaint. White walls, two brick side walls, black accents, metal duct-work ceiling. Local artists' paintings adorning the walls - not to mention bold bright color palettes. Floor to ceiling windows make for great people watching!  We got there after the main morning rush apparently, seeing as there was only one server gentleman and two other patrons. The gentleman was very polite. Gave us time to look over the menu, which is quite full seeing as they cover two meals of the day. The place mat houses pictures and descriptions of their fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.   Prep yourself, friends. These entrees are quite large! And, talk about striving for your five food groups! I got the Salmon Benedict dish. Another solid, very tasty meal! The salmon was fresher than the usual Ohio fare. Montreal uses Yukon golden potatoes, so anything with spuds automatically has a wonderful, almost \"sweet\" taste. Much fuller flavor than the regular 'ol white plain janes. My dish was incredible. The flavors were spot on. Loved the sautéed onions and green pepper beneath the salmon. Yolk was over easy, sopped it up with the warm soft yet crunchy edged English muffin. The fresh fruit cup was a meal in itself. Cold, juicy and sweeeeeet!  This establishment will remain bookmarked for my next return trip here, no doubt. The excellent quality, matched with a very reasonable price point. The only thing that bums me is I can't bring this place closer to home."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with lots of choices. Hot coffee. Didn't have to ask for a glass of water."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 6 people on a Tuesday morning. All the food was amazing - fresh fruit, good bread, well-prepared eggs, good coffee and a huge menu. The staff were very helpful and understanding of our two young kids in the party.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here after checking out past yelp reviews, and it was pretty good.  I was a little shocked at some of the prices (in particular the Croque de Fruits) which is yogurt fresh fruit and Quakers Croque Matin. But then the bowl came and I can see why! It was on the side gi-mongus and could have feed a few people. I could only eat about half of it before I had called it quits.   It was amazing however that we got seats straight away (considering it was 1130am on a Sunday) My friend who dislikes breakfast food was disappointed however, that they do not offer any of the lunch options on the weekends. So she ended up with a grilled cheese sandwich that comes with fruit and potatoes (which was surprising a good deal for all that). Lastly my other friend got a regular eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and potatoes.   Everything was good, coffee refills were speedy, and overall a decent breakfast place for sure. The only complaints: they opened the door to the patio a bit, and someone was smoking outside, and it came straight inside ruining the smell of breakfast; bathrooms are single stalls, which caused a pretty large lineup of people. Other thing to note: if I get this again, I will ask for the Croque de Fruits without powder sugar on top (unnecessary IMO)   I would eat here again if asked. :)  PS: They gave out roses to the ladies because it was mother's day!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day breakfast with mom at l'Ouferier DDO.  My mom had 2 poached eggs on English muffin with ham and spinach and I had a waffle covered with caramelized apples and covered with crushed graham crackers. The food was tasty and the service was courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast value in a very relaxed atmosphere. Had the Portuguese eggs Benedict with chouriço, bell peppers, onions, topped with goat cheese, and it was delicious. The fried potatoes were fresh, crispy, full of flavor and nothing like the dried up cubes you get in the US. Go there!"}
{"text":"We were a group of over ten people that showed up without a reservation on the weekend and they were able to quickly accommodate us. The owners were on site and were very sweet and helpful. Even though the size of our group was large we didn't wait too long for our meal. The portions at this place are huge and delicious. A few of us has smoothies and they were yummy.. Everyone was raving about their meal and we sat there till they almost closed..compared to the other breakfast spots in ndg,( chez Cora, The spot opposite it) this was a 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Good place to go with friends or family for a nice breakfast.   The menu is big, they have lots of choices with fun titles for each plate.   The food tastes good. Their portions are too big, i couldn't even finish my plate.   I am giving 4 stars because despite the kindness of the staff, the service was a bit slow and we had to tell them a couple of times that we needed napkins or/and coffee.   I recommend this place! You won't regret trying it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, adequate service, free coffee all for a fair price. Huge servings per plate."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us, from the outside, the interior looks like any sort of average-y breakfast place. A quick glance at the menu didn't really show anything that stood out for me, but we thought we'd try it. We went inside, it's small, bustling the staff are really nice and friendly, as well as professional and fast on their feet (plus they have to be fit because the spaces between the tables aren't very large). We took a look around and everyone's plates looked fantastic. Be sure to add a side of creton (no, not cretin), which is a Quebecois pate - quite yummy! Also, don't assume (like I did) that your fruit cocktail is a fruit cocktail - it's a fruit salad. So much for thinking I remembered some of my high school French! Though our server was busy, he was very friendly and helpful. It's busy, but tasty and fun. Prices were okay. Everything's fresh. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Waited a few days to get over here for breakfast & was not disappointed.  First off, get the Breakfast Poutine. Second, GET THE F**KING BREAKFAST POUTINE!! It's delicious and I'll dual you if you say otherwise!!  If for some reason everyone has ordered the Breakfast Poutine to the point that they no longer have it (a very plausible situation) they do offer many other breakfast and brunch items that are palatable in their own ways.   Located about half a block off of Saint Catherine, this is a nice shop that is in my mind, a must stop for food."}
{"text":"Une de mes endroit préféré pour les brunch! Les employées sont super sympathique et le service est rapide malgré la popularité du Resto"}
{"text":"Le brunch était classique, simple mais efficace. Je dirais un peu cher pour le rapport qualité/prix. Nous avions réservé mais en arrivant, il y avait une grande file d'attente. Nous avons pu être placés rapidement mais des personnes ont attendu longtemps. Je me demande si les gérants prennent en compte les réservations."}
{"text":"Same as most other L'eoufriers. Inattentive service, overcooked eggs Benedict, plates majority covered in fillers (more potatoes just to look like more food). Cute room for groups downstairs if you want a mediocre breakfast with pals."}
{"text":"The owners all always in house and although they sometimes help set tables and run food, they always put effort in to be in-touch with the customers. The male owner entertained me while I waited for my friends to show up by busting the bus boy (shawn)'s balls. My first time here I had the St Laurent (breakfast poutine with Swiss cheese, smoked meat and eggs Benedict) and it was 1. huge 2. Delicious. The waitress herself left a little to be desired. No check in ice we had our food, didn't monitor out drinks, slow with the bills because she was chatting with staff etc."}
{"text":"The food and portions was good. The service was not the greatest. Overall quality selection and service it is better then other breakfast place in the West Island ."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem next to my condo! The menu is extensive so if you have any craving, this place will deginitely fulfill it. You can even try something that is innovative or different from any other brunch places. Really love this place since it has a hipster vibe and a wonderful menu.  As for the food, you get fresh fruits and high quality food. You can even accompany your meal with one of their amazing smoothie concoctions that will require the assistance of a friend to finish it. I will definitely come back to this place again and again since it will take forever to try out each item of their menu."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this little place. We came here yesterday and were pleasantly surprised to see there was no wait. I was a bit disappointed to find out the place was a chain and it was a bit more diner-like than expected. However, the menu offered a very wide selection of basically any breakfast food you may want. I ordered the Portuguese Benedict which had chorizo, peppers, onions, and goat cheese. It came with a side of very fresh fruit and coffee. I also ordered a mango-banana-peach smoothie. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and smoothie. My friends ordered a more standard bacon and eggs breakfast, with a chocolate banana crepe on the side. They cleaned their plates completely, so I think they were satisfied as well. The place is a bit out of the way but I would come back."}
{"text":"Once there was a ketchup packet in my friend's smoothie (what?!) and the following time the honeydew melon on my wife's plate was rotten (mold on it...). Gave it a couple shots but as you can imagine I will not be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, delicious breakfast and even lunch. I would recommend it wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"We came here bc the other well know breakfast places that we had googled had huge line ups. And honestly it was one of the best breakfasts we've had. The staff was super friendly, the food was great and the proportions were large. The freshly made strawberry smoothie was just a bonus."}
{"text":"Been living next to this place for a long time and never gave it a second glance until this weekend! Previous reviewer sold me on it and I'm glad he did.   I love breakfast and I love not having to make it myself. I really like the simplest things when it comes to breakfast too: eggs, sausage, toast, potatoes, and fruit. And this is the standard breakfast you can get at all breakfast restaurants (it's probably the cheapest too!) L'oeufier actually has all this for $6.50, which is the typical range for this type of breakfast, if not on the less expensive side.   But was it any good? It was pretty darn. Eggs were done perfectly over easy and the house potatoes were unique and flavourful. The sausage was simply ok; I thought it could've used a little more time in the oven or grill. A part of the sausage (see pic) looked really awkward. The fruit was also underwhelming but hey, $6.50 here. All in all the food was a great value.  Service was incredibly efficient. There was one busboy that was out-shining all the wait staff with his speed and accuracy. Coffee was always flowing.  I definitely need to come back to venture outside my comfort zone. I looked around me and noticed some of the other plates... I don't usually deviate from my regular but dang, this place might leave me no choice!"}
{"text":"i am now sitting in there now. we have 3 people.  2 of us are ready to order. one more still need to decide. i got the waiter here to order first. i told him one of the orders, and he asked the other friend who is not ready yet. my friend says he is not ready. then the waiter just said \"oh, i though you are all ready\". and then turns around right away and leaves. i cannot order the second order. i need to wait for him to come back"}
{"text":"This place was little more then a waste of money. I ordered one of the delicious looking Egg Benedict meals that the menu displayed so brilliantly. Do you know what freezing cold hollandaise tastes like? I do now, and let's just say it's reminiscent of postnasal drip. No offer of a refill on coffee. Waste of 40 bucks."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is cozy. I had a waffle with strawberries, nutella and bacon on the top - just as amazing as it sounds. The service was good and they have a great variety of food and drink options. Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"What a way to start the day. Have breakfast here and you can't eat again until dinner. Great variety. Big hearty plates. Warm service and a good value. Don't pass them up."}
{"text":"After my cafe visit to Pourquoi Pas Espresso Bar, Mum and I went next door to grab some brunch. It seemed pretty popping in there with a line out the door so I wanted to check it out.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was not that good to me. Mum ordered the original Eggs Benedicts and I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict, but it didn't sit too well in the stomach for me sadly. The salmon smelled a little too fishy and the food just tasted mediocre. I have a feeling that I ordered the wrong dish at this place. The whole menu was in French and I'm a big fan of Eggs Benedict so that why I ordered that. But it seems to me that what they are known for is there waffles and milkshakes. The tap water tasted funny here too.  The fruit that came with the eggs benedict dish though was the bomb! The produce is just in a whole different level in Montreal than it is here in NYC. Maybe I should have just gotten a bowl of fruit salad because that was the highlight of my stay here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful discovery. We walked in and though they were slammed, we were seated right away.   Amazing menu and a great spot for someone who enjoys substitutes galore.   The space is very busy. You will be seated very close next to or even sharing with another party but the food will not disappoint.  If you are a glutinous eater- you are good to go. If you are a picky vegan- you are good to go   Also the names of the meals are a wonderful surprise.    Try the gluten free bread. This is the first time it doesn't taste like cardboard!!"}
{"text":"Love the extensive menu. Something for everyone. Big portions and comfort food. And the best, you can reserve. So great if u are a bigger group."}
{"text":"Bon déjeuner. La portion est grosse. Le service est bien. Et le menu offre un choix pour tous les types de mangeur. En fait, c'est probablement le problème, je trouve que le menu avait trop de pages. Et après ça on doit répondre à plein de questions sur la cuisson des ufs, celle des patates, la sorte de pains... très difficile de faire un choix."}
{"text":"Pas mal. La bouffe est pas mal. Le café fallait le demander, j'aurais aimé que ça soit un reflexe."}
{"text":"j adore ce petit resto dejeuner bon choix qualité prix beau sourire des employés bonne portion dans les assietes endroit chaleureux famille, entre ami,en gang je le recommande fortement a laval sur deslaurentides a vimont vous allez adorer"}
{"text":"Great brunch location. They do specialize in the juices, so I highly suggest you make sure to have space for that. Also, the menu is fully loaded with protein, breakfast sweets, and everything a good brunch should have. My group and I were highly satisfied."}
{"text":"I really didn't appreciate one of the waiter at this restaurant so now i am going to write my first comment ever at YELP.  This just happened not even two hours before,i was eating brunch there with my bf,there was a waiter served us,who wear glasses,not many hair,and has stars tattoo on his arm.  He was at first talking to my bf about the order in french,was quite normal,and then my turn,since im not good at french,and he was standing at my right side(unfortunately i have hearing problem on my right ear) so i can't hear clearly and i can't express myself very good.  Then he used english talk with me but with different attitude,you know,and after couples of questions i was sorry but asked him if he could please standing on my left side to talk with me,he IGNORED,continuing standing at my right side with low voice,i didn't find that was polite,but maybe he misunderstood,so i told myself let it be.  At the later time every time he came to us serving for coffee or food,he just talked with my bf(he is Quebecois),not even a single word to me.  Do i considered too much? Oh hell no,at the last moments when we paying our bills separately,he talked and smiling to my bf but when comes to me,i said \"Merci\",and he even not looking at me,and without a response,without ask me if i need a copy of the receipt.   If any manager of this restaurant can see my comment would be perfect,i dont know whats wrong with this waiter but you guys should have the right idea to treat clients no matter what are their backgrounds. And i found this is hilarious as L'Oeufrier is a restaurant in Gay Village in Montreal in Canada,one of the most open-minded area around the world.  Beside this,i have to be honest that the other staffs were nice to me and the food are awesome,they worth more than 3 stars.  But ask me if i will go back for second time?Haha,i think i am going to tell all the friends i know in Montreal about this interesting story at first"}
{"text":"I'd like to be able to do 3.5 stars to balance out the overly excited tourist reviews. It's breakfast for lunch, though, and just that (and the fact we can't give half stars) earns it that extra half. It's solid, good but not amazing breakfast fare from very nice people."}
{"text":"\"So sweet to eat\" (Actually, this  would be a 3.5 star review)  I came here because I wanted a sugary breakfast, because you have to treat yourself and it was near my local Airbnb. Also, this was one of the few places that had a \"late\" brunch menu on a Monday morning (around 11:50am). The place itself was cute, but the food was kind of average. I mean, it was good but it was nothing that I have not had before.   The menu is pretty extensive and the restaurant seems to have pretty much everything, so I  if you come with a group of people, then everyone will find something that they like. Also, the restaurant has a great selection of various fruit smoothies.   I decided to sit outside, since it was a nice fall day (by NYC standards). If you are allergic to bees then you should definitely sit indoors, because of the chocolate and syrup there were quite a bit of bees outside. A couple landed in my smoothie.   I ordered the Choco-gaufre - a half waffle with nutella and strawberries, two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast (about 13.50 CAD) . . . I added a side of potatoes, like I said earlier, treat yourself. The food was kind of cold when it arrived; I don't know if the plate sat in the window, because the service was a little slow. The waitress was really nice and cheerful but the it took a while to order food and for the food to come out. Then, it seemed to take forever to pay for my meal. Since I was outside, I assumed that it was really busy inside. However, when I went in to pay my bill, there were only three tables with people. So, I really do not know what the hold up was.   The food was slightly above average but the service was pretty average. I would recommend this place if you are really into nutella and are in the area. I would not come here if this place has a long wait or is out of the way.  Oh, one cool this about this place is that they have every single condiment individual packages (ketchups, mayo, peanut butter, sugar, jelly, etc.) that one would need on the table."}
{"text":"(More like 3.5)  +++ - Smoothies are great and fresh - Open early in the am, during the week  ++ - Two breakfasts for an inexpensive price - Waiter; between orders, coffee refills, serving food, and checks, this guy had command of the whole room  - Free coffe refills  + - Simple delicious breakfast - potatoes were cool, although they were more like french fries than hash browns"}
{"text":"Lines were going out the door of this diner while the rest of the street was dead. This must be the best place around! We thought. Luckily, the turnover rate was quite high and we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival.  The food was very fresh and delicious, but we've come to expect that from Montreal. I particularly appreciated the creative flare in the decoration, the menus and the presentation of the food. The people are friendly and polite, the whole place has a joyful, lively atmosphere and the patio is a charming place to eat brunch on a sunny day.  My main complaint is that we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food to arrive. I understand they are extremely busy, but we were already really hungry when we arrived, and didn't expect such a long wait. Also, it's a bit pricey for breakfast food, especially when converted to US dollars."}
{"text":"Went to have breakfast here at 2:30p.m as the sign on the window said closes at 3 p.m. walked in and was told they were closed?? When I said the sign says 3 p.m , the lady replied [we close the kitchen at 3 ] . Not cool, won't go back there"}
{"text":"Nice brunch place. Food was nice and not expensive, compared to those DT restaurants. We also tried smoothies, which were tasty too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Surprise de voir que ce restaurant à pu atteindre 4 étoiles. J'y suis allée à de nombreuses reprises car je vis proche. Il y a quelques années le service et la nourriture était déjà passable mais un peu trop cher. Maintenant c'est toujours aussi cher mais le service est brusque, inconstant. L'endroit est tellement bruyant que ça en donne le vertige... Pour un restaurant de déjeuner c'est surprenant, on est pas dans un pub. Bref je finis toujours par retourner au Cora sur ste Catherine ou on me reconnaît et m'accueille à bras ouverts!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I got the breakfast poutine (potatoes, eggs over easy, sausage, cheese curds, ground beef, hollandaise sauce) and it was seriously one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. For $12 CAD it was a good deal and I took half of it home so I can have something decent to eat on the plane. Bf had their lox bagel and coming from a New Yorker, he actually praised it as delicious and decent. Whaatt? Who knew Montreal had good bagels?   This place fills up fast during weekends so plan to get there around 9 ... by 10 am it was already packed."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Montreal, and we had a great brunch experience. I first saw a photo of their chocolate milkshake on Instagram and decided it's a must visit! They have a few locations around town and this one was walking distance from us. The food was delicious although portions are huge so we didn't end up having room for the shakes. If we were to go there again, I'd share one of their brunch dishes and get one of their shakes.   I enjoyed my smoked meat sandwich and breakfast poutine, but probably should've chosen the fruit side over the poutine as the meal was very heavy. My partner had the eggs, bacon, sausage plate that came with a strawberry, banana and nutella crepe. My tip would be to ask the server if the Nutella crepe can be served separately later since the crepe was soggy by the time we finished the savory food.   The servers were nice, happily spoke to us in English, and even gave us change and directions for taking public transit to Old Montreal."}

I went with their \"Pedro se present aux elections\" (I believe this comes from Napoleon Dynamite!). Which consists of bagel with an omelet, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and a choice of cheese. Side house potatoes are provided as well.  The coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently. Service was very nice.  The price tag is reasonable for what is offered.  Will I come back? Not when it's cold!!! Sorry but what's up with the lack of a double door? There's room for it, make it happen. When I visited it was -10 degrees Celcius outside. Is it too much to ask to have a 2nd door to prevent the cold from coming in and bothering your patrons eating? The place was cold! No wonder everyone who sat inside sat in the back. This is the first L'Oeufrier I say half full at 11 AM on a Saturday. Other locations have line-ups outside the door. Because of thisI had to eat with my winter jacket on and wanted to GTFO as soon as possible.  L'Oeufrier... je t'aime but... but 2nd door yo."}
{"text":"L'Oeufrier is a breakfast chain established back in 1995 that is currently quickly expanding in and around Montreal region that I feel that within the next few years will be at the tip of everyone's tongue as the place to go to get a great breakfast much to the likes of Allo Mon Coco is today in Laval.  When I walked in with my wife and infant I expected something good but our experience here surpassed it by far and it was nothing short of excellence across the board and I can't wait to go into the details as to why I enjoyed my experience here so much.  L'Oeufrier offers a huge variety of breakfast, brunch, lunch grub within a neat and polish little book that will simply make you more hungry than you already were when you walked in. You usually tend to get anywhere between 2 to 6 menu pages in most breakfast places... they have nearly 20. Insane!

They have the standard type of breakfasts you can usually get elsewhere, shakes, smoothies, various egg Benedict dishes, omelets, poutine breakfasts?!?, patati patata?!?, grilled cheeses, crepes, waffles, brioches, french toasts... etc. The lunch menu has sandwiches, salads and burgers... all in all, the choices are numerous.  We went with Le Petit Gourmand (eggs, bacon, sausage, banana/chocolate crepe) and Ole Coco (same thing with only standard crepes with a lot fruits) variety breakfasts. They were extremely good across the board. The eggs were done to perfection, the sausages were good and bacon was.... as good as bacon usually is. The fruits were of top quality and very fresh and the crepes were just right.   The coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently. The extremely friendly and super accommodating waitress we had went above and beyond. The food came quickly and I was offered things you don't get elsewhere as much as you should.... normal maple syrup or the \"real kind\". I opted for the real kind and it was awesome.  I noticed she was very familiar with her regular patrons, I thought it complimented the place a lot. I hope to get the same sort of treatment down the line as well.  In particular note, the bread is quite special and comes from Premiere Moison. It is of the superior variety with long thin slices of bread, toasted to perfection that truly complimented the meal we had. What an excellent idea.  The price tag is reasonable for what is offered.  Will I come back? Absolutely!!!! Most likely this upcoming weekend and will probably be incorporated in our regular resto rotations if this excellence keeps up. Odds are, we'll be trying out the specialty plates like the poutine breakfast, the patati patata, egg Benedict and so forth.  L'Oeufrier... je t'aime."}

The coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently.  The price tag is reasonable for what is offered.  Will I come back? Absolutely!!!!  L'Oeufrier... je t'aime."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  For starters, the portion sizes are huge (we were all very full before we could even finish our food!), And the food is excellent to boot!  Not only that, but the waitstaff is *very* nice. I suffered some (very minor) teasing for my indecisiveness, but that's totally fine with me, and there was someone whizzing by offering coffee every five minutes or so, so we never ran out of coffee (or water!). Their smoothies are downright fabulous (I had the mango, peach, and banana), and it was definitely worth it! (It cost around $5-6).  I was absolutely delighted to find their bathroom cleaning schedule pinned up in the bathroom, and even though it is small, it is cleaned every hour every day!   The decor and atmosphere are nice, although those aren't usually my top priority, and it's in a nice neighbourhood.  And, the best part of it all; the names!  Every dish had a (hilarious) name that's the perfect combo of cute and quirky (the dads favourite; Sam is still on vacation)!  The names honestly just push it over the edge for me (and for the rest of my party!)  I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really awesome brunch alternative if you're looking for something similar to Universel. It offers all the standards in brunch that you could dream of -- Eggs, benedicts, omelettes, crepes, waffles and French toast. The decor and menu are really bright and happy. I ordered a skillet with meat, veggies, scrambled eggs and cheese -- Very tasty and exactly what I wanted. It's certainly a step up from similar places like Chez Cora and Tutti Frutti. It's ideal if you want to skip the line at Universel or L'Avenue. You can never have too many brunch options in the plateau!"}
{"text":"Nous avons essayer l'uf ruer sur blvd le Corbusier pour la première fois et avons été agréablement surpris par la variété du menu et sa créativité. L'endroit est sympa et les couleurs fraîches! Les assiettes sont bien remplies et je dirais même que mon seul reproche est la quantité exagérée de pommes de terre dans les assiettes qui leur donnent un allure moins appétissante. Sinon les gaufres, crêpes, viandes.. tout était délicieux! À refaire!"}
{"text":"My experience seems to be more disappointing thank people who came here. I ordered three cheese egg Benedict, I was very surprise to see them use kraft cheese on their food. For the price they charge, i did not expect to have that. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied by this place, would definitely recommend.  - servers are awesome: smiling even if they're having a super long day, friendly, welcoming. All you are looking for , for brunch !  - the food is wonderful. The omlets, bagels, and waffles are incredible. You can tell the food is fresh  - the menu fits everybody. There's almost too many choices to pick from. They really made it so it would accommodate all types of tastes and desires.  - prices: very decent compared to the other brunch around the area  - wait time to be seated : tons of seating, barely had to wait on a Saturday at 1pm   If there's 2 things to improve it would be the service time, and the outdoor seating. We waited over 30 min to get our food, and there's only 3 tables outside. Otherwise I wouldn't Change anything , and I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cute brunch spot in the neighbourhood close to where we were staying for the weekend.  Lovely terrasse but it was full when we arrived around 11am on a Saturday.  We were seated at a table for four inside, which wouldn't have been too bad had it not be directly under the AC vent.  This made for a chilly meal.  I ordered the traditional breakfast with fresh juice and coffee ($9.99).  It came with my choice of eggs (over easy), hash browns, crispy bacon, 2 sausages, a slice of cantelope and orange, and 2 pieces of toast.  Portion size was pretty generous.  I couldn't finish the hash browns or sausages.  The fresh juice was a nice blend of mixed fruits and you could still taste the pulp, a nice change from the traditional orange juice.  Others ordered the mushroom and brie eggs benny and the smoked salmon benny ($12-$15) and we're quite happy with them, especially since they both came with a generous side of fruit.  Service was okay, not the best - we had to flag down another server to order apple juice and get ketchup.  The place was super busy with hungry brunchers on this Sat. morning.  Decent brunch and would return if we're in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I enjoyed my experience at the Montreal Ouest location of this chain restaurant. It doesn't feel impersonal like some of the big scale chain brunch places do and truly does seem like a small family owned place. My waitress was super nice and was always passing by with coffee and water refills.  My friend and I both had the 2 eggs, potatoes and one options breakfast. We also both chose french toast as our option. As I was trying to deliberate on the type of potatoes (fried vs mashed) and eggs (scrambled vs over easy) that I wanted, the waitress was nice enough to offer me half and half for no extra charge.  The meal arrived pretty quickly and was a huge portion. Everything was good except for the mashed potatoes (pretty bland) and the french toast (We both found it to be underdone). I was too hungry to complain about the french toast but if I order this again, I will be sure to ask to cook it a little longer.  It wasn't the best food ever but for around 10$ tax and tip in, it is a great post hangover or family brunch place. I am a bit biased because I LOVE Montreal-Ouest in general but I will for sure be coming back here!  Food: 3/5 Value: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5"}
{"text":"I don't care about the other Oeufrier!  This is my place, the one I love in the middle of the great Montréal-West village!  Isabelle & John & tout leur staff sont géniaux! Toujours bien accueilli et bien servi!  Oui c'est crowdé les samedis et dimanches!  Parce que la bouffe, l'ambiance le service est A-1  Les plats sont originaux et copieux!  Tu es mieux d'avoir faim mon / ma cochone!    Après tout!  C'est samedi matin, munchies d'un lendemain de vendredi soir ;-)  Même s'ils sont occupés!  Ils sont fort attentionnés et refill vite eaux et café!   Ils travaillent en équipes et il y a toujours des bonnes discussions endiablées et croustillantes:)  On ne peux écrire de quoi il s'agit ici, car à l'oeufrier, on applique le Las Vagas Principale:   What happen à l'oeufrier stays at l'oeufrier  :)  Savourez!   Le nec plus ultra du foodism for breakfast!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ma visite à l'Oeufrier sur Mont-Royal! Malgré une file d'attente à notre arrivée, nous n'avons pas attendu trop longtemps avant d'avoir une table. Le service est vraiment rapide!! Nous avons aimé la sélection de smoothie qu'offre le resto. Nous avons d'ailleurs essayé celui aux fruits des champs et celui aux ananas fraises et framboises. Les 2 étaient très bons! Ça donne bonne conscience pour la quantité astronomique de gras qu'on a ensuite englouti avec nos plats haha!! Mon copain a essayé la poutine Ménage à trois (chorizo, saucisses italienne et une 3e viande qui m'échappe). C'est une \"assiette d'homme\": GARGANTUESQUE. Il a apprécié son plat, mais ne le recommanderais pas puisqu'il a trouvé qu'il y avait trop de sauce hollandaise. De mon côté, je me suis délectée de mes oeufs bénédictines italiano (avec saucisses italiennes et fromage cheddar)! L'assiette était copieuse (2 oeufs bénédictines + plat généreux de fruits + beaucoup de patates) et au contraire de mon copain je n'ai pas trouvé qu'il y avait trop de sauce hollandaise même si mon assiette en était bien remplie. Elle était si bonne que j'en ai trempé mes patates. 43$ pour ces 2 plats copieux et 2 smoothie. Nous y retournerons lorsque nous aurons encore une fois une faim que nous croyons insatiable!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I've ever had. We had to wait ten minutes for a table so we were served complimentary, fresh squeezed orange juice. Good coffee and nice service. Brunch itself was great and menu has too many good choices to choose from!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré la la place, en plus c'était vraiment bon. Le service était un peu long, mais pas de la a déranger."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends vraiment pas pourquoi ce restaurant à une note de 4 étoiles! Les prix sont trop élevés pour ce que c'est. $15 pour une crêpe avec fruits et nutella très ordinaire qui nous laisse sur notre faim...Musique et ambiance qui laisse à désirer. Je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Easy to find parking on a Saturday morning, and the terrace was quite nice. Their smoothie is very sweet, but the blend of flavours is well balanced. I tried their Nutella waffle (with really incredibly creative names) and it was okay, not out of the world kind."}
{"text":"I had their grilled cheese sandwich  - Le plateau Mont Royal. With two types of cheddars and Swiss cheese.  It was meh."}
{"text":"Ok food... All 3 different sausages i had was over cooked. French toast was pretty good."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast here this morning and I would give the resto an A+ for food presentation, quality, and variety, but a C for service.   What hit my hubby off to a bad start right away was what we like to call \"selfish seating\". Despite one or two  private spots being available, we were seated in between a group of 6 on the left and a bellowing couple on the right. The tables are very small so there simply wasn't a comfortable amount of space. I, personally, didn't mind it so much because as soon as the group left, our waitress slid their table over to ours so we had more room. I thought that was a nice gesture. Unfortunately we had to ask three separate times for a glass of water. They failed on this one. We ended up leaning over to the bus boy and asked him.... was pretty bad.  The menu is great. A little pricy, but the food is good. I orded the Bene L'Oeufrier, Eggs Benedict with asparagus/ham/Swiss cheese, home potatos, and a lovely side plate of fruits. This was $14.99 but I'd say a very good meal. Hubby orded a basic egg/bacon/creton meal for $9.99, he enjoyed it. They have great smoothies, I was surprised how fresh it was considering this time of year. They come in an adorable mason jar. Smoothies are $4.95. Hubby reported that the espresso was pretty good too.  Overall, my hubby was quite turned off and said he wouldn't go back, however *I strongly disagree*. I enjoyed the breakfast and I guess I was just in a better mood. I would go back and I think it is return worthy.   Thank you for reading!"}
{"text":"I always get nervous about a new restaurant with pictures of food on the menu, particularly after enjoying such terrific, simple breakfasts during my long stay in Montreal. But sometimes, when a hard hangover hits, you need that full brunch experience and this spot was able to accommodate our large party easily on a late Sunday morning.   To my surprise, this was a solid breakfast joint. Sure, it's not the kind of place where the food is an incendiary, artisanal slam dunk, but there's something to be said for nailing the classics which L'Ouefrier does with flying colors.   I had a simply veggie omelette with a couple of pancakes and a smoothie, so a heavy meal but for my tastes, the kind of items that a breakfast joint simply cannot struggle with and they were all solid.   With many locations around Montreal, when I return I would not mind a stop back here."}
{"text":"God I love breakfast.  I love it in a way I'll never love my own children.  This place is perfect.  It's on Mont Royal, and is pretty huge considering that it's not on the busy stretch of the road.  It might be the best deal for breakfast I've ever seen, either in Canada or America.  One plate came with eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit, a fucking crepe, and toast, and the whole thing probably cost less than 10 dollars (fake money, not American).  They kept the front of the storefront completely open, the staff was quick and helpful, and the food was cheap and good.  Stay classy Montreal"}
{"text":"I usually love coming to l'oeufrier for a yummy breakfast. The menu is filled with yummy choices. However, this specific location disappointed me. The restaurant had flies flying around and the service was horrible. As we were sipping our coffee getting ready to order, we were asked to move because they needed a table of 6. The waitress was very snobby throughout the whole time. Once we moved and ordered, the food took about 25 minutes to arrive (this was simple eggs and bacon ....) the waitress never came back to see if everything was okay and we ended up having to get up and paying for the meal at the counter because everything was so slow paced. I love l'oeufrier, but I will never come back to this specific location again."}
{"text":"Exactly as ordered. The Vegetarian omelet was properly cooked; the egg AND the vegetables inside. Yummy home cut pomme de terres (no I can't speak French) and good multigrain toast. The coffee is bien aussi.  Good, quick service."}
{"text":"L'Oeufrier is such a lovely little breakfast spot, my boyfriend and I actually ate breakfast there two mornings in a row during our recent trip to Montreal.   The fresh OJ is delicious if not a little over priced; I can get two cartons of Tropicana for what they charge for one glass. But still, fresh comes with a price tag. Our omelettes (the Nature with Brie and the L'Oeufrier) were both delicious, perfectly cooked, with the most delicious toast I think I've ever had. So crunchy but chewy at the same time, yum! The breakfast potatoes were another standout. Everything was fresh, hot and delivered very quickly.  Our first server was super nice, and we found his service to be great despite a slight language barrier. I also discovered that we had matching tattoos on the same wrist which made for a nice little bonding moment for us. The second server was fine, as well, just seemed a little more hurried.   Prices were very fair for the quality of food and also their portions. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Montreal. I would like to try some of their crepes next time, they looked delicious."}
{"text":"Bad ambiance, cold tea, cold bacon, cold eggs,... junk food really. Go to the Avenue instead. Same price and way better."}
{"text":"Not suitable for vegans. But I guess that's clear from the name of this breakfast chain. You can either stay a strict vegan and order a fruit salad, or indulge in everything an egg can do: Omelettes, pancakes, waffles, French toast, poached eggs, fried eggs, the menu never ends! Oh actually, the smoothies are vegan, super delicious, and huge. The milkshakes are also all you ever wanted a milkshake to be - just not vegan.  It feels very much like an American family diner. The staff is friendly and they even go around handing out free tasters. You won't leave this place hungry, you'll rather leave this place rolling..."}
{"text":"I have been to l'Oeufrier before but not to the one and Chabanel. So on a saturday morning, i suggested this place to my family and we decided to go. We arrived around 12:30 pm, the place was full. This restaurant is not very big, it's not wide. We waited for almost 30 minutes until we got our table. I didn't mind the wait, but some members of my family did. Anyways, the place was so packed and it was clear that the waiters were busy; i wasn't expecting a good service. I was actually surprise of how good the service was tho! They surprised me because they were very attentive and made sure that we were happy with everything. My brother went for a plate with a chocolate pancake, he loved it. For me, i went with the traditional breakfast plate ( eggs, sausage & bacon). I wouldn't mind going back and give it another try."}
{"text":"Nice place! Went there on a Sunday morning and the place was packed. Since the restaurant is very big, we didn't have to wait to get a table, there was already one for us! L'Oeufrier is great day place for breakfast with family or friends. This one in particular is lovely because of the space and the decor. Also, our waitress was so nice! Always smiling and making small jokes here and there. Would totally go back :)"}
{"text":"The waitresses are very sweet and when a friend joked I required the massive Nutella jar to fulfill my needs, she brought it over promptly. French toast are a little bland so go for the pancakes! Good and convenient for Westmount folks who are too lazy to drag themselves the 10 blocks to Orange Cafe."}
{"text":"Très bonne localisation, non loin du parc de Westmount pour une balade digestive. Bonne nourriture et grand choix de smoothies. Le service était très efficace et en plus il était en français."}
{"text":"Très belle place avec une jolie terrasse chauffée pour un mois de mars. Des très belles assiettes qui ont le goût de bien nous remplir le ventre."}
{"text":"Bagel with smoked salmon was horrible. Service was not as expected. Felt very unwelcome :("}
{"text":"Casual family spot for brunch.this breakfast chain does not disapoint and if you're craving all kinds of breakfast food this place will probably have it on the menu.love the mashed/hashbrown potatoes."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Governour's hotel on Saint Hubert and wanted to try breakfast somewhere nearby before heading home. The menu at L'Oeufrier has something for everyone. From breakfast poutine to waffles and french toast. This is breakfast mecca. It was a Monday morning around 10am when we arrived, and we were seated right away. The host/server was attentive and brought us menus and coffee right away. At first he brought us menus in French; it is Montreal after all. I don't speak French, but I was actually having fun trying to figure out the dishes using pictures and my limited understanding of the language and language in general. The waiter saw this attempt, and realized we needed English menus. It made ordering easier, that's for sure. I ended up getting one of the breakfast poutines (since it was our last day and I hadn't had any poutine yet), the one with Emilia in the name. It had sausage, goat cheese, peppers, onions, and a bunch of tastiness, plus over easy eggs on top. My partner got a basic breakfast platter and we shared the chocolate banana brioche. Mmm mm mmm!  It was all really delicious.  Very crisp and clean decor, friendly service, and worth a try if you're in the area looking for a casual bite to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The manager yelled at my face. Will not go again even though the food was alright. The fact that she treated me so poorly, it made the experience just not great overall. Why hire people like this?"}
{"text":"I want to put no stars. I was stuck and needed a cappucino on a sunday morning. The female owner of this place can barely smile. She said they only had one size of cappucino so i asked for an extra shot. I assumed incorrectly that i would only be charged a little more but she printed off the bill and it was $8.41! I asked what happend and she said straight-faced that they didn't have a button on computer for extra shot so she charged me for two capps !! I can only assume the owner has no business scrupples, common sense, or otherwise. I cancelled the order and she said that she would \" let it pass this time\", like i was trying to pull a trick on her. I walked out with my crapuccino. They are always burnt there."}
{"text":"The food is rather plain and dry,and the coffee is bad as well. Service is decent but the food was disappointing"}
{"text":"Good breakfast at a decent price. I've had breakfast here several times now and it shows that I enjoy this restaurant. Lots of variety and interesting items on the menu. You can have your standard breakfasts or go all out with nutella and poutines. Definitely a fun menu. Don't pass up a chance to go. I guarantee you'll want to go back to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture et service impeccable!  Comme toujours. Nous sommes toujours satisfaits lorsque nous allons à cette succursale.  Pour un repas avec nos jeunes enfants, c'est l'endroit idéal."}
{"text":"It is a very nice breakfast place ! The ambiance is nice and the menu in French is funny and well thought. There's so much variety in the menu, it's very impressive! It's definitely my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place! This location is owned by a really nice local couple who I always see at the restaurant. They clearly have their heart set on the place, always interacting with customers and greeting them with a smile.  The food is offered in a very vast menu ranging from the delicious breakfast poutines to mountains of fruit piled onto waffles. Their smoothies are well-priced and always made fresh. Portions are more than enough to satisfy your cravings and the food comes out pretty quick.  I'm here at least once a month for a good weekend brunch and have no complaints so far!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, my group of 4 came here for Sunday brunch. We were fortunate enough to get a table outside, after a short wait. Our server was great - spoke English well, very funny and accomadating. No issues whatsoever.  The food was amazing! I had duck benedict with the best side fruit salad I've ever had. Prices are reasonable and bug portions. I would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant très bruyant. Le service peut être long, cela a prit facilement 15-20 minutes avant que quelqu'un vienne nous voir. Les serveurs passaient à côté de nous et tous semblait penser que nous avions déjà été répondu, malgré les menu fermer sur le côté et les journaux ouvert (les menu sont ramassé après la commande).  Côté nourriture, les portions sont bonne pour le prix. Il y a tout de même beaucoup de choix. L'endroit semble être accro au nutella, on le retrouve dans vraiment beaucoup de plat.  Cela reste un bonne endroit pour aller déjeuner le matin seul, en ami ou en famille. Les tables ne sont pas très grande par contre alors ne pensé pas être dans un endroit avec beaucoup d'espace ou d'intimité, c'est très serré."}
{"text":"Got to say I rarely give breakfast places over 3 starts this one earned there 4th. I don't remember the name of my plate but I really enjoyed it huge portions I didn't even finish my plate took it home for a midnight snack :). The waitress was nice she came to fill my coffee when ever I needed it had a nice smile good personality.. I'm defiantly coming back just look at the photo and tell me it doest look good ."}
