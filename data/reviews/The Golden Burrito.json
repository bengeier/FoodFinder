{"text":"If you're looking for a burrito in thornhill, this place is it.Tried this place out last night and I came away very happy. I have had my fair share of burrito boyz and golden burrito seemed to be on par/better than them. Only reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is I'm a tough critic."}
{"text":"I would say these guys are in line with Burrito Boys and Fat Bastard. Definitely worth a try! I live in the area so at this point I've tried most of their burritos. Similar to the other burrito joints, the hot sauce is REALLY hot!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in toronto. The fish and shrimp burrito and fries supreme is excellent for munchies.  They need better ventilation but over all a good choice for lunch..just expect your clothes to smell like smoke"}
{"text":"Very good Burrito. Huge is really HUGE. Fresh ingredients. Lots of variety from halibut to shrimp, to five different types of chicken (ceasar, adobo, etc.) I stuck with Chicken and it was well made. Reasonably priced. First time was a little dry, second time got extra burrito sauce and it was perfect. Better than Chipotle as the previous reviewer said. Hope this place sticks around. We need a good burrito place in this area. Closes early so not good for late night eats. Would be a 5 if it was open late a la Burrito Boyz and some of the other joints."}
{"text":"Wen here today to fill a burrito craving.  Comparing it to chipotle there is no comparison.  It was a bit bland and not really that enjoyable to eat.  Would have been worth it to drive a but further for chipotle."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burrito place.   I have been to all others and this place is amazing.   Their hit sauce is hot and delicious.   I love it."}
{"text":"It's an aight burrito. Not the best but I don't think anyone actually expects much anyways. Tacos are blessed tho. I only come for that hot chick  who works on there on weekends to be honest"}
{"text":"The burritos are big, tasty, and filling, but this place has way too many shortcomings to recommend it. First off, the service is absolutely terrible. The staff are friendly enough, but sadly, some of them are pretty incompetent. Especially the guy working the kitchen. On a few occasions he's forgotten to even start making parts of my order, and you need to ask the staff 2 or 3 times before he'll even start. I just got back after waiting 20 minutes for just fries, because each time I asked I was told \"they're coming\", and it was at least 15 minutes of this before they were even put in the oil. I wouldn't mind if there were other things cooking, but there weren't. There were just empty baskets.  Second, I don't trust the cleanliness of their kitchen. I know Mexican food can sometimes go right through you, but on one occasion I couldn't even finish before rushing to the bathroom. I figured I'd give them another chance, but now I'm wondering why I did. Again, this probably has something to do with the one and only person I've ever seen working the kitchen. If he constantly forgets to make food, I have to wonder what he's forgetting to clean, or if he's remembering to put food in the fridge at the end of the day.  I'd love to recommend this place, because the burritos are really tasty, but it's not worth your time. Go to South St. Burger Co. next door, or one of the other restaurants within a few seconds of there.  Edit: Ha! I'm not surprised this place was shut down. Turns out they owed over 20 grand in rent, but they probably would've gotten shut down for the reasons I mentioned here anyway."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a burrito and this place is close to my work so we thought to give this place a try. Fortunately we arrived just after 12 noon because not long after that the place was jammed with customers!  The service was very friendly. The decor definitely needs refreshing! I have to say that I've had better burritos. These were just sort of blah!! I had the Adobo Chicken burrito. I'd probably try Burrito Boyz next time I have a craving!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get burritos! I brought my friends and family to this place and they all rave how tasty and delicious its burritos are. The staff are very kind and nice as well. I always leave this place feeling satisfied with the food and customer service."}
{"text":"Four more excellent burritos.  Ground beef,  mango chicken,  pulled pork,  and a veggie.   Cilantro makes the burrito.  You want a cold burrito, go back to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Delish.  Had a small and it was more than enough for lunch.  Adobo chicken with everything made medium hot.  The place was pretty busy but the ppl behind the counter were not (seemingly) in a rush :) which was a bit irritating.   Will totally go there again."}
{"text":"Burrito was fantastic! Very satisfying! For something called a \"massive\" burrito, I was expecting something a little more epic considering the price.  The service was a little slow. It took a while to finish cooking the burrito unlike most places I go to but I chalk that up as a better quality. when someone takes their time serving the customer, why should that be considered a detriment? In any case, the menu was good and I'm glad they don't charge extra for guacamole!  As a local Mexican place, I'll be sure to check it out again!"}
{"text":"I've had Golden Burrito a few times now and it never disappoints.  I usually order the small bean and cheese with all the toppings and the burrito is always grilled to perfection.  They have a unique noodle filling which I was first skeptical about but it really adds to the flavour. Ingredients are fresh and tasty and the hot sauce is actually really hot (very similar to Burrito Boyz on Adelaide).  They should considering adding a soy meat burrito for vegetarians.  They also have a Yam burrito which I will try at some point.  Prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly.  Looking forward to my next meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out this new burrito spot because one of his coworkers told him about it. The food was alright. The flavor was there but the chicken wasn't. Very small portions, even for the \"huge\" burrito. The one and only thing that pissed me off was the fact that when the girl was preparing our burritos, she picked up the rice and noodles with her hands (with gloves on), when there was FULLY a SPOON to scoop it! That's unsanitary and honestly, I just found it odd. Personally, I would never come back here again or recommend this place."}
{"text":"The burritos are huge and awesome. I always order the small chicken because it's massive, tasty and filling. I have also tried their chips,beef burrito and chicken nuggets... All great! Chicken nugget combo is $4.99 and comes with a lot of food.  Their prices are reasonable. Their service is fast and friendly.  It's a fast food restaurant, so don't expect much from their decor. They only have about 6-8 tables. Doesn't matter though... The food is really really good!"}
{"text":"I don't complain about my food much however a review is necessary (it is my first), I can only compare this place to Chipotle and it doesn't even compare.  When you go in they have a size menu to how big you want your burrito to be, so if I were you go with the small to try or big if your hungry, I did take the huge and it was pretty big maybe a little bigger than Chipotle but not a huge difference.  Like I said I'm comparing this to Chipotle because I love how homemade it is, the process and all the flavour.  First of all they don't have saut√©ed peppers and onions, and the beans are fake, came from a box like a bean fake spread you can buy at the grocery store nothing unique about it.  The rice was cooked alright. The toppings are your usual toppings nothing fancy, even though the guacamole is free they are scared to put any on, while in Chipotle if you get charged extra they make sure they put it on every where.    Overall the taste of the burrito was bland, it was lacking flavour and seasoning.  It's called salt and pepper none existing, cilantro as one of your toppings really? Caned salsa and bean paste as well.  Also the taste of the tortilla itself wasn't great at all.  Not to mention while your burrito is done, you have to wait an extra 6 minutes until they heat it and give it grill marks on the flat top.  Why would I want my sour cream and guac heating up?   I paid roughly $11 for a chicken burrito with tax for a HUGE, I would pick Chipotle any day of the week for $12.50 with the guac.  PS I can make a better Burrito at home as I cook alot, can't see this place sticking around for long especially when people were going in NY Fries and not The Golden Burrito"}
{"text":"This is an example of the right idea at the right location. Too bad the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Their burritos are bland and mushy. They also take an excessively long time to prepare. None of this seems to matter, there's nothing like it in the area so the place is always busy. I love burritos and work in a near by office complex but can only get myself to come here once a month or so. The decor is just as half-assed as the food.  10 bucks goes a lot further at the Quiznos around the corner."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick meal with some colleagues. I ordered the chipotle chicken burrito (small), while my colleagues ordered the rice bowls. The burrito was average, and the selection of toppings were standard for a mexican fast food place. However, my burrito took a long time to come out. I felt bad for my colleagues, who waited for me as their rice bowls came out in 3 or 4 minutes. By the time they were done about half their rice bowl, my burrito finally arrived and I had to wolf it down to save time. Maybe it's just the burrito, but if I ever come back in a time crunch, I will remember to order the rice bowl."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for burrito. Just a couple of things I found strange about their menu:  1.  Noodles in your burrito? Never really heard of that. It's a weird concept and I never really bothered to try it.  2.  Cilantro is also strange.  3.  Their beans look really funny. Not appetizing at all.  Although staff is really friendly, the food is average. Plus I think it's a little pricey so I usually get the huge burrito to share with someone.   This place is okay for burrito.  Not the best obviously. But it's good enough after a work out and you just want to eat anything. They have Vicinity rewards...you get a free burrito after buying 12...lol...if that entices you."}
{"text":"Came here to fill a burrito fix since there's nothing else nearby, and was extremely disappointed.  We walked in around 7:30pm on a thursday and there were hardly any ingredients left, with a TON of fruit flies everywhere.  Of the ingredients still available, nothing looked fresh.  Only noticed this after we ordered and paid, as the ingredient station is around the side.  Have to admit... very weird process - noodles?  And once the burrito was made, had to wait about 10-15 minutes for it to just be grilled.  Overall, will not be back again.  I'd rather drive an extra 20 minutes to a chipotle.  If Golden Burrito staff are reading - please get rid of those fruit flies!!! Can't be good on the health and safety scale to have at least 2 dozen flies landing on and flying around your open \"fresh\" ingredients."}
{"text":"I've come here 3 times so far. Very tasty, and friendly service. Only thing was once I found a little piece of bone in the chicken. But I guess that it's a sign they use actual meat (laugh).   Definitely worth it especially if you work nearby and need a quick tasty lunch."}
{"text":"The burrito was awseome. You tell them what kind of meat you want. Then you move to another station to pick your toppings.  One of my favorite toppings was the chow mien  and guacamole with no extra charge. The fries were a whole different story, couldn't stop eating them. That's how good the fries were."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have been pleased each visit.   I usually get the pulled pork burrito and it is always great. The large nachos are a great portion for 2. (For 2 people and nachos it's about $28-$30 inc tax.   Price is very reasonable and good portions."}
{"text":"definitely had better buritos before but i love buritos and I love to see more of these burito places around. The burito wasnt great flavor wise but it was fresh and in decent size. I wish it was more authentic and had more \"mexican\" feel to it. Good choice if you're looking for food variety in this area."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  This is a great place with a friendly staff.  It lacked a bit of flavour but all in all great value."}
{"text":"Mediocre place for burritos, definitely had better ones.  I ordered a small chicken burrito (~$8) . You got to customize what you wanted in the burrito, similar to subway. The toppings weren't that fresh and the flavour of the chicken was a bit bitter. I can say that I didn't feel the best after eating it... so I don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Very good place Clean food tastes great I found it a bit expensive but not out of control better then alot of other more popular burrito places"}
{"text":"An amazing lunch spot. A wonderful burrito and you can have it so many different ways.  A unique feature The Golden Burrito provides is the grilling of the burrito on a flat-top to both seal the tortilla shut and heat the contents.  The small burrito is filling."}
{"text":"Just happened to come across this place for lunch.   Ordered a promoted day of the week deal - 3 hard shelled tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 pork for $5 or something like that.  Not bad, I'd go back to try other stuff on the menu.. a burrito perhaps."}
{"text":"It was average, but hit the spot. Not the best I've had but I like the variety they offer in their \"special burritos\". I'll definitely be back since it's closer to my school than other burrito places. In comparison to bigger chains like Chiptole or Burrito Boyz, they are not up to par."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty is how I would start the conversation.  Very casual. Serving the area and lots of local businesses. I've never been disappointed on this lunch.  Mexican food and drinks all the way.   This is a local gem serving all the classics from burritos, quesadillas, tacos and nachos.  Sizes goes from big to huge. They make everything fresh and in front of you.  Vegetarian friendly with fish, shrimp, saut√©ed vegetables.   Not much seating here for diners. Can fit maybe 20 people. They have takeout which is the way to go here.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An O.K. Burrito. We ordered one chicken burrito and one with pulled pork, both were pretty dry (pulled pork was worse) so it ruined the burrito a little, rest of the toppings were pretty tasty. Will not go there on purpose but if im in the area and need something fast I might come back."}
