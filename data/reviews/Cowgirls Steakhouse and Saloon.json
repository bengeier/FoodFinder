{"text":"Service was not bad but the food was below par. Hamburger bun was dry, and my wife's pulled pork sandwich bun was dry as well. When they toasted the bun it turned it into a crouton, making it extremely crunchy and stale tasting. The fries came out luke-warm and tasted as though they had been under a heat lamp for a while. The hamburger meat was also chewy and not impressive. This was not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Average bar food at best. The wait staff was comprised of young kids that didn't seem that concerned with delivering good service.  The jalapeno poppers were disgraceful.  My burger was adequate while my wife's salad was pathetic."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Friday evening. We didn't have to wait at all to get in. I had the salmon strips and shrimp. They were very bland. My daughter had the ribs and they were very hard and difficult to eat.  I doubt that we will return."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for something to fill in this charming building in Avondale (the West Valley can be so neglected sometimes), so we were excited to see Cowgirls arrive! We really enjoyed our meal. The meat was tasty, the sides were great, our red velvet cake was a nice way to end the meal, and we got a table within twenty minutes. We just beat the Saturday night rush, though; those who arrived shortly after us were waiting forty minutes for a table. The live music is a nice touch. The ambiance is nice; it is loud but manageable. Our server was attentive; the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Finally a good place on this side of town. If you are looking for a great steak prepared to perfection and enjoy a more upbeat type of establishment, then Cowgirls is where you want to be. I enjoyed the live Country Band, which I learned that there is different ones every Fridays and Saturdays. not only that but its open til 2a.m on the weekends.  Overall it is a great spot, kitchen needs to speed things up a little but doesnt bother me much because quality food takes time well see ya there!;)"}
{"text":"Decided to support this local place for Friday night Happy Hour. Like others have posted, I also understand it was their first friday night service, but their are some real other issues than being a new place.   I am not a restaurant owner or anything like that, but I do frequent them and I can tell you I will most likely not visit this place again, for the following reasons: ask our server about recommendations for some appetizers and she states she hasn't tried anything; ordered the shrimp appt, which states is served w garlic bread, when it comes out it doesn't, we ask the manager and she says it doesn't, we show her the menu and she's states ohhhh, she brings a small piece of bread on a napkin (u serious); asked for a glass of water and got like like 10 mins later.  I understand it was opening weekend, but I would have recommended them to do a soft opening so they could have got a feel of how to operate. I'm hoping things improve soon, and the flat screens is my reason for 2 stars."}
{"text":"Disappointed to go by this past weekend and see the ominous \"Closed for remodel\" sign.  too bad"}

{"text":"Went here for lunch & I have to say I would go back again. Me & my husband got seated immediately as it was only 2pm. We got our drinks quick too. We ordered the chili w queso, was pretty good. He ordered the Top Sirloin medium rare, it came with fries & a salad, a little weird but ok. The steak was seasoned well & cooked right. I ate his salad since he doesn't like them & I liked it. It was a simple salad, iceberg lettuce, cheese & diced tomatoes on the side. I loved how it was separated just in case someone doesn't like tomatoes. I ordered the Shrimp Po Spur sandwich, it came with fries. Only came with 4 individual shrimps, lame, but it was tasty & filling. I just wish it had more creole sauce. Our waitress was attentive & nice. I loved the atmosphere very inviting. I would like to go back for dinner some other time."}
{"text":"Something new that isn't a chain! Awesome!  I've been in for a drinks a couple of times and thought the atmosphere was relaxing. Guests were coming in and out just like regulars...great new place to hang out, watch some games, have a few brews and wonder if the blinged out belts are required! haha  Great place & good times!"}
{"text":"We came here on a rainy Saturday night for dinner.  We were seated immediately, the hostess asked if we wanted the high tables or the regular ones.  Regular, please.  I hate when my feet are dangling and not touching the floor.    We were greeted by Jacob, our server.  He was pretty good.  Attentive but super busy and the poor guy was losing his voice.  They had Rusty Nunez,  an acoustic solo act playing when we got there.  He was GOOD.  He played and sang Country, Classic Rock, Alternative Rock and Contemporary.   We did not order an appetizer because I wanted to try for dessert tonight.  I ordered the Prime Rib (only available on weekends) with soup (Italian wedding) and a loaded baked potato.  My soup came out first, it was good but two tiny meatballs in the soup was kind of disappointing.  The prime rib was cooked medium-well perfectly and the au jus that came with the meal was spot on.  The loaded potato was good too.  My husband enjoyed and woofed down his salad, Flank Steak (marinated with chili-cola) cooked rare, and loaded baked potato.    I had to get to churos and ice cream combo.  WOW!  Warm churos and cold ice cream YUM!.  My husband had his 3rd or 4th Guinness as dessert.  Our bill came to a little over $60.  Not too bad for steaks, drinks, and dessert."}
{"text":"Two star was upgraded due to the atmosphere and live music. We started with the Texas chili Nachos - huge mistake - came out after about 15 minutes with severely burnt and at some points charred black chips. Yuk! I ordered the flank steak and it was actually very well prepared and quite tasty. My wife ordered new york strip steak and she enjoyed that as well but both our dishes took over 20 minutes to come out and we were so hungry at the time it could have added to the taste. What was the comeback killer for me was the mac and cheese. Seriously it was watery, and had plain planko bread crumbs just thrown on top right before it left the kitchen. I have never had mac n cheese as a side that I could not finish. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone unless you are coming just for a great steak and wait.... that's about it."}
{"text":"We were not expecting a lot since this was their opening weekend.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We had on of the best Rib-eye steaks, it was very tender and lots of flavor.  The service was great, and we loved the atmosphere with a live band.  This side of town was needing a place like this.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was pretty cool, I got invited to come here for a company xmas party after being employed for a couple of days.  The atmosphere was good and the live band sounded really good.  I got the filet and it was pretty good,  but the steamed veggies tasted like they were of the frozen variety.  The aparagus was cooked perfect and tasted like it was fresh not frozen.  To me, I would probably come out here again more for the hanging out listening to live music other than just for the food."}
{"text":"This is the third restaurant to occupy this space since we moved to this part of town 7 years ago, so when a new one opens up we always give them a try. We went in the middle of the afternoon on Sunday, no wait, seated promptly, the waitress was friendly and provided great service, we ordered a pizza and a tenderloin with a baked mac n cheese, which arrived without much delay, food was tasty and the atmosphere was nice. Not sure if I would enjoy a loud band on Friday or Saturday nights, I perfer a quiet dining experience. People who expect too much from a freshly opened restaurant need to wait a month or two to let the crew settle in to their positions and then give it a try. I hope this one can stay alive........give 'em a go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been driving by this restaurant as it sat vacant for over a year now.  When I saw the sign that a new place was finally going to be there, I was pretty excited.  I couldn't wait to find out what kind of place it was (praying it wasn't a Mexican joint - my stomach refuses to behave after eating at them!), and felt pretty neutral when we learned it was going to be a steakhouse.  Meh.  Okay.  We'd give it a shot.  We ended up going to Cowgirls last night (the second Friday they were open, I believe).  For two of us, there was a projected 20 minute wait, but we actually got seated in about 10 minutes.  My boyfriend was freaking out about the booth to table space.  If you are a larger person, he's convinced that there is no way you are going to fit in the booths, and he's probably right.  We saw a few larger women with their bossoms resting on the table, they were wedged so tightly into their booth.  Oh my.  However, he also pointed out that most of the bigger people were seated at the tables, and I didn't really find the booths to be an issue.  Just tighter than normal.  I ordered a filet tenderloin with a baked potato and side caesar salad.  Though the side caesar is not on the menu as a choice, they were happy to substitute it in.  My boyfriend ordered a full rack of ribs with fries and asparagus.  We waited about 15 minutes for my salad to arrive, but it was a very busy night and the waitress was very attentive.  About 5 minutes after my salad, our food arrived.  It was great.  We both enjoyed our main courses (and my steak was cooked perfectly - rare) and the sides were also very tasty.  The waitress was prompt about delivering refills and handed us our check in a timely manner.  Friendly, fast service, good food for a reasonable price, and hopefully a fun place to go for the nightlife out in the West Valley in the near future.  I hear they are going to have live bands and push back the tables for dancing.  Sweet.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Beer was cold they seated us fast! Service was sub par! But when I go out to eat its for the food! They don't have a big menu and it doesn't matter cause they don't get it right anyways! Food was horrible!!! Gave us ribs just with BBQ sauce smothered in it and not hot!!!!! Didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked came out raw in center. They were polite but overall we for sure will not be back there!!!!"}
{"text":"We were invited here with some friends for dinner. The service was poor to start with but the live music was nice so we weren't too bothered at first. Once we were able to order it took forever to get out food and our appetizer came after we were finished eating our meal and it was wrong. Long nights story short  after complaining the Assistant General  Manager who came across drunk brought our waitress and proceeded to have our table criticize her to her face in front of him. We had already spoken to him privately and so refused to insult her in public in front of him. I changed my mind about her poor service and was no longer irritated with her and quickly decided he needed to be let go of his position at the least and totally for the best interest of the establishment. I have never had such a poor show of leadership and what was supposed to be correction of a problem in my life. I was so embarrassed for her and really put on the spot as a customer.  I will NEVER go back here for any reason. The story is much longer and a waste of my time to repeat. The food was just O.K. but liked it a whole lot better than the customer service. Oh and lastly he offered to take of the appetizer from the bill as a courtesy, Oh hey Mr. GM we never actually got the appetizer it was wrong and they took it away."}
