{"text":"This is located inside Greenland supermarket. Went there to try their samgyetang or chicken ginseng soup. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I felt it was a bit long since food court is supposed to be selling items that are quick to serve. The taste and freshness of the side dishes could be better. The chicken ginseng soup was decent. I felt I was getting healthier and stronger. It is one of the Korean dishes that boosts your stamina."}
{"text":"Greenland Market Food Court Woori House. It was best place to eat. delicious, reasonable price . You can find assorted korean Food  that you like"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch before shopping at Greenland Market.  Got the spicy mackaral and the spicy nangmyun.  The mackaral was ok but a bit pricey for the number of pieces you got.  The nangmyun was a miss. Noodles should be a nice al dente but was over cooked and the the sauce was lackluster there was very little veg.  The side dishes were decent."}
{"text":"The combo with cold spicy noodles and galbi was spot on. It came with three sides that were equally delicious!"}
{"text":"I love a good sweat when I eat.  Especially when I'm cold! Was shopping at the market and figured I'd just grab something.  Quick glance around and I notice this red and soupy bowl was being delivered to a couple.  Great, I'll have the same!

The Spicy Beef Soup (Yukaejang) had a good mount of kick in it.  Phenomenal flavor with that amount of heat.  I must have been really hungry because i was still eating the soup with the accompany rice, and they gave me a generous amount of fixings.

2nd time around my bowl was less filled with the usual green onions, gosari, brisket, glass noodles, and eggs.  It's ok since i had a rough start earlier at a neighboring food vendor.  Soup was still kickass though.

A-OK in my book. 3.5/5"}
