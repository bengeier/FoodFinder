{"text":"The super friendly staff is half the reason I keeping back to this place. Always good when your in a hurry and on a budget. You can not beat their prices. It doesn't hurt they are open super late either."}
{"text":"Real good Mexican food. Fair price for dinner for 2, byob, sat outside, good service again quick to bring out food. Not 1 thing I could critique"}
{"text":"Pretty under-whelmed by this place and surprised by the reviews.  Ordered the fish tacos and a combo plate with .  Both dishes were pretty overpriced, in our opinion.  

The fish in the fish taco was pretty dinky sized and mostly fried breading.  You can't really mess up fish tacos though, so taste wise it was fine.  Shredded cabbage and a lot of sauce.

Combo plate again was on the small side and just ok.

Chips were pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the salsa.  It was pretty thin and a little bit tangy/sweet?  I couldn't quite place the taste, but i wasn't a huge fan.

It wasn't horrible.  It was just kind of disappointing and kind of overpriced.  Perhaps we ordered wrong.  If we ever give it another try, I think we'll go with the Carne Asada fries and burrito."}
{"text":"The Burrito was very very dry with only Rice and Beans in it. No Guacamole no Sour Cream or Lettuce or any other veggies. There were a few onions and capsicum pieces sprinkled on the burrito but it was very very dry from inside. We then requested for some salsa so that we can dip it in and swallow it."}
{"text":"This place is great.

Reminds me of all the mexican places I went to while I was living in Vegas.  The chile relleno was amazing.  Great flavor and good balance.  Wasn't as impressed with the super nachos.  Don't know if it was a one time thing or not but the chips seemed to be on the stale side.  

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are excellent. Burritos generous and full of flavor. Chips & guacamole are excellent as well. A regular stop."}
{"text":"Los Cabos is definitely one of the better places to get Mexican food in Pittsburgh. I used to go there at least twice a week when they originally opened. The prices were very reasonable, the service was great, and the food was incredible. Recently, I go there with some caution. I've had a few instances where the owners/managers and regular cooks were not there, and the service and food was noticeably worse. I believe that I once waited about 20 minutes for a burrito, which I found to be really strange. However, other times that I go the food comes out extremely fast and tastes amazing. The menu is extensive, which is great. They recently raised their prices though, so you can end up paying up to about $9 for a burrito FYI. I would recommend this place, but go there knowing that there's a small chance you will be disappointed (although I hope not!)."}
{"text":"I would go for the 4.5 star as well. Went there with 2 other people and all of our food was good. I am guessing it was the owner who checked up on us a few times and chatted it up. He was a really nice guy. We had their special pork, cali burrito, and shrimp casadia. All very delicious.  

When I asked for some hot sauce, he said \"oh you want the real hot sauce\". He then brought me some habanero and some really good cilantro sauce. 

It's not the best Mexican I have ever had but probably the best I have had in Pittsburgh. It's not a glamorous fancy place either. The decor and atmosphere is what you would expect from a standard Mexican joint in Chicago or La or something.

Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Chili relenos is the worst I've ever had. It was soggy, and had no flavor. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"They were out of tamales the night we went, which was a disappointment. Vey casual dining, seat yourself and pour your own drinks. Most people seemed to get carry out. Tostadas were lacking flavor, with too much lettuce on top and runny beans. Fish taco was good."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills, great value Mexican restaurant within walking distance for most Bloomfielders.  Prices are excellent and portion sizes are generous. This place has definitely become a regular spot for me -- Veggie Burrito."}
{"text":"Super great fish taco.  Near Children's Hospital.  Friendly service.  Beef tacos were just ok, nothing special.  Beans and rice with dinner didn't wow, but were typical Mexican restaurant fare for Pittsburgh.  I would highly recommend the fish tacos, and it gets high marks for quick orders to get back to the hospital."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place, but the cheaply priced and quality food will keep you coming back. Fantastic California burrito (with fries) makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been religiously coming here for months...simply stated everything is delicious.  

Ever since moving to Pittsburgh three years ago, I've been dying for a good Mexican place.  I've had to sustain my Mexican food craving on Chipotle, but then Los Cabos popped up and it's like a whole new world. The people working there are super friendly, it is byob with a six pack shop just down the street, and if that's not enough the food is phenomenal. The menu is exactly like what you would find in San Diego, down to the horchata and carne asada fires.  If you dont know what to get, start with the California burrito.  You cant go wrong with meat and potatoes.  Also, I highly recommend any burrito with fries in it, the chimichanga, and shrimp ceviche.  Come hungry though, the portions are substantial and you will inhale the free chips and salsa they give you while you're waiting for food."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here tonight...and am sad I've waited so long.  The fish tacos are perhaps the only authentic California-style fish tacos I've had outside of California -- and boy, how I've tried to find them.  My boyfriend had a combo platter, and was similarly impressed.  I'm so happy to have a great Mexican place so close to home.  And the service was super friendly as well.... Aces, all around."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place!!  Fantastic food!  Very filling!  As a matter of fact, I am still full after 3 shredded chicken soft tacos and a carne asada burrito.  I went to lunch 8 hours ago!  Food is served very prompt and is absolutely delicious!  Taco bell, Mad Mex and other \"authentic mexican\" establishments are like puke compared to this place.  You order at the counter and then your're seated.  Before your meal, you are served tortilla chips and the best organic salsa this side of the border!  The interior is bright, yet not too overwhelming.  A nice blend of deep reds and black.  I always love to find new places to call my own.  Please include this place as a precursor to your daily siesta!"}
{"text":"a worthy compliment to ritter's on the other side of bloomfield.  a two word (three with contraction?) summation: it's open"}
{"text":"California Surfing Burrito. Awesome stuff. Very close to what you'd find in Southern California ."}
{"text":"Carnitas Burrito- Good God- It is delicious!

I concur!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am from California. I grew up in NorCal and spent my college and post college years in SoCal...and I miss Mexican food.

First of all, I read a review stating \"Socal, Tex it's all the same to me for the most part.\" They are very different styles of food and I think its important to go into Los Cabos knowing that

Now to the meat of the matter (yes that word choice was on purpose). This is not your Northern California Mexican food; no nicely grilled chicken with rice and black beans in a whole wheat tortilla. This is a burrito that consists of only large amounts of meat, cheese and guacamole wrapped in an amazingly tasty (and likely fatty) flour tortilla. While not quite the same as what I ate regularly in Cali, it is still very good. I would probably give it a 4/5 stars if it were in San Diego, but I'd still eat there regularly especially because their California burrito is actually better than the ones I used to eat. 

If you've never had a California burrito, you should. It has the usual meat, cheese and guac, but also has fries. The reason why Los Cabos' California burrito is so amazing is that they make sure their fries are crispy which add more texture and flavor to this awesome burrito. I have yet to try their carne asada fries, but I can only imagine they will be amazing. 

You must try Los Cabos. They are by far the best Pittsburgh has to offer for Mexican food that I have found so far."}
{"text":"Disappointed! They were out of Diet Coke  and carnitas. The guacamole was tasteless as was the salsa. Service was also slow. We will not return."}
{"text":"Am not from here in Pittsburgh but let me tell ya this lil place home town feeling restaurant is absolutely amazing and truly authentic and best of all it's easy on your wallet five stars all the way around from food to the service !"}

1.0 / 5 - Carnitas: Dry
1.5 / 5 - Carne Asada: Decent
0.5 / 5 - pollo asada: Tasteless"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. I ordered the fish tacos and my gf ordered a beef taco and cheese quesadilla. Just didn't think anything had much flavor. She said the beef taco was good. Was all edible but nothing was above average or great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Los Cabos.  Both the food and atmosphere are a mixture of SoCal (i assume) and Pittsburgh, which is a lot cooler than it sounds.  It is almost like a melting pot of freshness, cheaposity, and choice.  Liberawesome! 

I have had the shredded chicken burrito, the bean tostada, the quesadilla, and the California Burrito. So far California Burrito is my absolute favorite. Carne asada, fries, and a sour cream sauce make a super-filling and super-tasty dinner.  Since sizes are so huge, i usually cut it in half and have my lunch for the next day.  I am looking forward to trying the Pittsburgh Burrito which has fries and coleslaw! 

Service is fast and friendly and in the case of the hostess, SUPER CUTE.  They never rush you to place your order and are willing to make substitutions. I always leave a nice tip because i enjoy eating there.  

I plan to come here even more often once i wean the husband off of Qdoba and Chipotle!  I LUVZ U, LOS CABOS!"}
{"text":"A simple environment with incredibly delicious food. Los Cabos is an utterly unpretentious establishment with a great value for money. The staff seems to genuinely care about their patrons, and the food is authentic and wholly enjoyable. This is not a Michelin starred, tablecloth-ed fine dining experience, but for what it is, a good, economical neighborhood place, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos! Everyone here is super nice and very accommodating. The breakfast burritos are huge and well worth the price. We've asked for them with no meat and added veggies, and always get an assortment of fresh veggies, which is delicious."}
{"text":"As an update, the bean and cheese burritos are still very good but the prices have gone up so that it is no longer a budget choice compared to chain restaurants.   Today, I branched out and had the chicken burrito and it had no flavor.  To the restaurant- Please revisit the way you cook meat or consult with someone."}
{"text":"It's okay. I don't usually eat Tex-Mex so my opinions on it when I do are probably pretty weak. I liked the salsa and chips, and the carne asada was really good. The churros tasted like churros. For some reason, the other person I was with thought it was horrible, though. They like Tex-Mex more than me, so maybe they know something I don't."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I was not blown away.  My husband really liked his burrito though.   The girl serving at the counter was very nice.  I would try it again."}
{"text":"You blink, and you'll miss it. Tiny place in the middle of a block of different stores. Don't let that deter you from trying it out!
Enchilada - fairly plain but I thought the sauce was mixed well with the spices; nice mini kick.
California burrito - humongous and full of flavor! Definitely a stuffed burrito.
Surf n Turf taco - YUMMY!! Balanced perfectly with toppings to meat.
Fish taco - I wasn't 100% sure about the hype surrounding this taco; while good, it didn't \"wow\" me enough to talk about it. I think the Surf n Turf blew the fish out of the water! (ha)
Carne Asade fries - dang good! I have never had anything of the sort (usually it'd be chips, not fries underneath all the goodies). Definitely recommend. 
You do get a basket of chips and a small thing of salsa while you wait for your food. (Surprisingly good salsa)."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to stop in here as I ride my bike past here more than drive in the area, why does that mean that I can't stop in on my bike??? I don't know, but anyhow I came for my first time today with my special lady. I don't know why but I was slightly agro that I couldn't find parking, I have to say it was sort of tight. 

We came in right before the lunch rush and were greated by a nice lady and she was kind enough to answer my barrage of questions. The menu is extensive and I really didn't know what to get so we both went with combos which I think are a pretty good deal for what you get quantity wise. 

To sum up everything we tried: tostadas and chicken enchilada combo, I thought that the tostada was pretty good but the enchilada was definitely lacking. Why was the enchilada lacking? red sauce was pretty weak, almost as if it was straight out of the can. The rice was ehhh and beans were slightly bland. You might ask what do I want out of my rice and beans? Ahhh For them not to be ehhh, the rice to not be super dry and the beans to be flavorful. Also the chips and salsa???? What's up with that, they were cold,really cold. If you are going to have fresh chips, serve them fresh... not sitting in the ambient air of the cold entry area soaking up staleness. we also tried the beef taco which was good,extremely juicey. and Chile Relleno which was also tasty.  

I will come back and give it another whirl maybe I'm not ordering the right stuff or coming at the right time. I wish this place would have blown me away. Any suggestions????"}
{"text":"A quick, good deal if you order the right stuff. It's a casual spot with very fast service. I think my meal came out in like 5 min. 

I ordered the cheese enchilada combo platter with 2x beans substituted for rice. The presentation was nice. They serve decent free chips and salsa which - always appreciated. I love Mexican food but this tasted kind of bland. It wasn't cheap, greasy Mexican food. My enchiladas didn't seem cooked enough and the beans were not well-flavored. I've heard that the tostada salad is an excellent deal with a lot of food and a fine flavor. However, as a vegetarian, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Really love the carnitas torta & the carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"I love Los Cabos! I usually get their burritos and they are all fantastic. When you eat in they bring you freshly made chips and salsa. The only downfalls to this place are that: 1. Service is terrible on Fridays, seriously you will wait for a while (still worth it) and 2. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Los Cabos was pretty good. We stopped in for dinner, not really knowing what to expect. I had hoped for sit down service, but you order at the counter and then grab a seat if you so desire, which is fine. The workers are extra friendly and very helpful. It was a good dinner, I'd come back. I think next time I would just grab takeout for lunch/dinner.

The menu is your standard authentic Mexican dishes. And it comes out extra fast, and warm and delicious. I did an enchilada combo and it was so yummy. I also had a hard taco on the side, but I would pass on that next time. It was shredded beef, but honestly, I prefer a low-end taco bell-esque ground beef concoction.To each their own. We also received complimentary chips and salsa for eating in, so don't bother ordering it. 

It was amusing that they don't play Spanish music, but instead just play Discovery Channel shows in Spanish. Counting Cars is great with a Spanish voiceover while chowing down on some refried beans. Dream life at Los Cabos."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed.   The Carne Asado burrito was full of beef that was waayyyy too salty and hardly any guac or pico in it.   I kept trying to tone down the salt by piling sour cream and extra guac (I ordered an extra side) but it was just so bad.   I gave up and threw the burrito away.  The side of refried beans was watery and gross - the kind you can get out of a can is better.   I ended up layering the beans, guac, sour cream and salsa and eating it as a dip with chips.  Mixed together it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good.   With all the great reviews on here, I'm really surprised that this is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten (Sorry :-( but it's true)  If you want good Mexican, go to Patron, Emiliano's, Cuzamil, Mad Mex, El Burro, pretty much anywhere else."}
{"text":"Last night was my second attempt at enjoying Los Cabos. Sadly, like my first visit, I was disappointed. My food was mediocre (not terrible, but nothing special) and overpriced. I'm glad they lost the Styrofoam plates since the last time I visited, but they still use Styrofoam cups which is kind of a turn off for me as far as restaurants go. 

However, as others have noted, their service is great and the employees are very friendly. And they offer free chips. Unfortunately, their great service is not enough to make me want to go back. Unless, of course, it's late on a Friday or Saturday night and I'm looking for some greasy food to satisfy my drunken appetite."}
{"text":"This place is certainly three stars in my book, but I plan on coming back.

The first time I got the carne asada chips/nachos.  I was pretty excited about the concept of steak and melted cheese served on chips.  Unfortunately, the blandness of the beans canceled out the delicious marinade of the carne asada; leaving me with a pretty bland dish since there wasn't anything else on the enormous platter to kick things up a notch.

They did a decent job on the quesadilla--so far the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  They actually put some flavor in there and crisped up the tortilla.

Most recently I got the chimichanga, which was a big step up in flavor compared to the carne asada chips.  It wasn't quite as crispy or overflowing with cheese like I'm used to with my TexMex favorite, but it was pretty respectable.  Peppers, delicious marinated beef, and pico made this a worth while adventure.

In the end, the food is good enough that I would come back--maybe during lunch hour--but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to take an out of town guest there.

And Yelp, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD COMMON MEXICAN FOOD TERMS TO YOUR SPELL CHECK?"}
{"text":"Wohoo, this was good.

I have no taco background that would validate (or invalidate) if this place is authentic or what style the tacos were...but here is what I'll tell you.

I had a fish taco and it was awesome.  Then I had a carnitas taco, this was even more awesome.  Then I had some of my byobeer, and I loved it all even more.

Chips and Salsa and Guacamole all solid.

They are very nice and great service.

and AND they are open till after the bars close on Saturday nights.  This wasn't when I visited, but I can only imagine that when I eat a taco at 2am there after a night at the Brillobox I will reach a transcendental state of enlightenment.  At least that's my plan."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in the city.  Burritos are great, and the salsa is beyond Amazing.  I will come back again and again and again and again...."}
{"text":"We just had take out from Los Cabos.  Delicious.  I had  beef tamale wrapped in corn husk, chili relleno, and chicken enchilada.  All the dishes had the \"authentic\" taste I haven't had since I lived in Colorado (although there is/was a great place in Johnstown, Montoya's?).  We were going to get the food at Round Corner but they don't take credit cards and we had no cash. However, you won't need much cash (or credit) at Los Cabos, very reasonable.  Like Mexican?  This is a Must Try.  It was very busy with take out orders when we were there. I'll get beef tamales again next time."}
{"text":"The chorizo breakfast burrito is amazing, delicious, and filling. This place never disappoints. The service always comes with a smile, too!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is definitely not well known for its Mexican cuisine.  However, Los Cabos is one of the best and is certainly worth your visit. I've been back in Pittsburgh for a few months now, but tonight was the first time I had heard of, noticed, and tried Los Cabos.  Will I go back?  Absolutely.

At a friend's suggestions, I ordered the beef Chimichanga.  And a soda.  I was told that the Chimichanga was going to be huge, so no appetizers for me.  The staff was very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be on the job.  Once we ordered and sat down, we were given chips and salsa to munch on while we waiting.  That  was a nice perk.  

Food arrived a plate or two at a time (there were 6 of us), but that wasn't a huge issue.  My food was last to arrive and when it did come, I was shocked at how huge my $7.95 Chimichanga was.  And man was it tasty.  I couldn't finish it, although it was begging me to finish.  Now I'm not only completely full and satisfied, but I also have lunch for tomorrow.  

Go try Los Cabos.  And order the Chimichanga.  Do it."}
{"text":"I grew up in Escondido, CA and this is by far the best San Diego style Mexico food in PA.

Get the Carne Asada burrito and Chile Relleno"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.  They were so damn friendly today, they gave us free shots because it was Mexcian's  Independence Day and gave my buddy a free desert because it was his B-day.  Not to mention, the burritos are the best in Pittsburgh.  Really is no competition. California, let's go."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot in Lawrenceville - I got a combo with 3 rolled beef tacos, a chicken enchilada, rice, beans, lettuce, pico, and guac and it was all delicious. I got the food to-go, and I think I waited all of 6 minutes. The staff was super nice and helpful. It's BYOB, so I'll definitely be back! Thanks, Los Cabos!"}
{"text":"Flavorless meat, salsa was just tomato sauce, rice was rubbery, bottled Jarrotos was warm out of the fridge among a few other things"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place. I was here about a year ago and had the chile rellano plate and it was amazing. I ordered it on my last visit and it was so way off I couldn't eat it. It was mushy and tasted like it was freezer burned. The beans were soup consistency and my plate looked a mess. The other item with my combo was rolled tacos. It was just meat rolled in a tortilla. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either and could have used some seasoning or something. My daughter had the shrimp burrito and after I took a bite I realized my choice was a huge mistake. 

I gave 2 stars and I really did want to give more but the food (besides my 1 bite of a burrito) just wasn't good. Parking is a challenge here so it would take more than one menu item to be good for me to want to come back. Sorry, not sorry."}
{"text":"This place is always fine.  Not great, not bad.  Just kind of fine.  For some reason it always annoys me that there is not a website with the menu posted online - you have to just look at low resolution photograph on Yelp..."}
{"text":"4.5 Star! This place deserves a 4.5 star with the price, quantity and quality of the food combined.
Although the place looks like one of those Chinese take-out places, but the food content is pretty amazing. When you first walk in, you have to place your order at the counter. They'll then delivery it to your table. Although my fiance didn't get the nice cozy sit down place that he was expecting, the food made up for all the difference! 
We tried their Pittsburgh burrito and the chicken house special (i think it was Carne Asada with Chicken). While we waited, they served us a bowl of chips/salsa, it was nothing special, but it was free food!!  We were shocked by the portion of the food when it came out - they were very generous!
As for the taste, granted it's not the same as a fancy/expensive restaurant, but it was still pretty tasty/yummie for the price. I definitely consider as some good comfort food, especially on a SUPER COLD winter day. The burrito was made Pittsburgh style (with fries)! With the sauce they added, it was very delicious. As for the chicken, they used white meat, but it was also surprisingly tasty and it wasn't dry! Wrapping it in a tortilla shell, I was able to make my own tortilla! 
If you want some fast but good tasting Mexican food, go give this place a try IF you're looking for a romantic date, then this is not the right place for you."}
{"text":"Wanted to go somewhere for some authentic Mexican cuisine. I love BYOB places so when I discovered this spot in Lawrenceville, I just knew that eating here was meant to be. 

My friends and I grab a table--the place is pretty small, which I like. Very cozy. You have to go up to the counter and order and the cooks bring your food out. 

Be prepared to wait. People were coming in picking up takeout and there were only 2 people working that night, the cook and the guy at the register. I waited about 10 minutes in line to order my food. 

I chose to get the enchiladas, 1 chicken and one cheese, combo plate. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come after all of my friends ordered there's. 

I give the food three stars. The enchiladas were ok. I also had rice on my plate but it wasn't cooked thoroughly. The chips and salsa that they gave us was extremely cold. I never realized how much I liked room temperature salsa before now. 

If you are looking for an inexpensive outing, where you can bring friends and get some tacos, be sure to check it out. I just wouldn't recommend my dish."}
{"text":"Los Cabos is a great restaurant and very reliable for a good bite. I live right around the corner and eat here about two times a month. 

You order at the counter when you walk in and get your drinks and then choose a table where they bring you your food. The menu is expansive and they have jarritos, which is always my drink of choice with Mexican food -- the mandarin flavor is the best. 

When dining in they promptly bring free chips and salsa which are always tasty...salsa is sometimes spicier than others but that tells me it's fresh and I like spicy anyway. 

I've never had a bad meal. I usually get the soft tacos with either carne asada or chicken. Portions are plentiful and three tacos is more than enough to to fill me up. The guac is really good. 

All the people who work here are friendly and helpful, if quiet -- which is fine by me!

I'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Easily the worst enchiladas I've ever had. So bad, in fact, that I'm writing this review as they sit in front of me. The verde sauce is watery and tastes sour, the enchiladas themselves almost seem like they were frozen and microwaved (which would explain why they arrived at my table 2 minutes after I ordered them and there wasn't a soul in the kitchen), and the tortilla chips are cold and stale. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent Mexican meal."}
{"text":"I love Mexican so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I had four different soft tacos and rice/beans.  I had a ground beef taco, garlic shrimp, shredded pork, and carne asada.  The shredded pork was by far my favorite and that Is not my favorite style, but it was very tasty.  I enjoyed the garlic shrimp with the exception of the creamy sauce that was poured on top.  Without the sauce it may have had a lot of potential.  The ground beef and carne asada were OK.  The same goes for the rice and beans.  Chips and salsa were slightly above average.  The young lady behind the counter was very courteous.  This is not a must go to place, but not bad if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers, I am also from Southern California and it has changed my view of Mexican food forever. I've tried quite a few Mexican food places since I've been in Pittsburgh and Los Cabos is one of my favorites. The people who work there are always friendly, and they offer free chips and salsa when you dine-in. The fish tacos are AWESOME and the enchiladas, quesadillas, and all other tacos are great as well. I'm sure I could recommend more, but I usually get the fish tacos and only occasionally try other food options."}
{"text":"The food looked much better than it tasted. The salsa tasted like plain tomatoes, and the chicken in my quesadilla was brown and tasteless. Prices are average. I paid about 9 bucks for a medium sized quesadilla and a small drink. My order was also forgotten. The only positive I can think of is the complimentary chips and salsa (despite the average quality of the salsa). Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Delivered quickly excellent food very please definitely do it again
Have the shredded beef tacos and The State tacos they were so flavorful we really enjoyed them"}
{"text":"A very solid fast-food Mexican establishment.  Los Cabos serves up quick Mexican food at a very reasonable price.  During my visit here I tried the cheese enchilada combo.  The meal came out hot; however, I noticed that the tortillas used for the enchiladas were somewhat stale at the edges.  Serving sizes were generous and overall service at the restaurant is fantastic.  Chips come complementary with your meal.  While the actual tortilla chips are solid, the salsa is a standard watery roja-type concoction used in many other Mexican restaurants.  Overall my initial impression is that Los Cabos is a quick, cheap and solid establishment, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I will be sure to give this place another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"I left Los Cabos 4 hours ago.  Four.  And I can't stop thinking about the salad.  What's WRONG with me?

The salad in question is the Surf Salad - a combination of grilled mahi mahi, shrimp, avocados and so much deliciousness.  Each bite was better than the last.  Get the dressing on the side - fifty bucks says you won't even touch it; the salad is that good alone.  My mum ordered the fajita salad with steak and was equally impressed with hers. 

So - BYOB, amazing food and delightful/fast service.  I'm not sure what else to say. Can I become an investor in Los Cabos? Can I marry the cook? Can I move in upstairs?  Eh, I guess I'll just settle for dining here as often as humanly possible.  Da-a-a-mn."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and at first I was very hopeful. The decor is reminiscent of taquerias out west, and the service was friendly and prompt. Still, I mostly rate a place on the quality of the food and it was decidedly subpar. I tried three different tacos here: chicken, pulled chicken, and carnitas. They were all certainly edible, but the tortillas ruined the experience - they were tough and greasy.

On the plus side, the complementary chips and salsa were decent although the salsa wasn't very hot.

If I try this place again, I will probably avoid the tacos and try something else."}
{"text":"California Burrito keeps me coming back. not every dish is made the same way every time but it is always good. Would be 5 stars but sometimes service is inexplicably slow. 

please add chorizo hash to menu!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada with fries.  It is listed, I believe, on the board as an appetizer.  However it is HUGE. HUGE!  It's served on a large oval dish/platter, with french fries at the bottom (which is, I understand a mexican socal thing) and oodles to yumminess on top: minced grilled/cooked steak, onion, lots of cheese, guac, salsa, and crema.  Maybe some lettuce?  Anyway, it's one of those dishes you eat and eat and eat and don't make a dent in.  I have yet to finish one, and I always go in with an appetite.  So it's really a lunch for today and a meal for later.

For $8.25 it is a steal.  You still get those homemade chips and salsa (the leftover I spooned onto the carne asada) and with a drink it's about 12 bucks with a tip.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was great. Host was weird and walked away without asking us to fallow. 
The food was amazing. Other staff members were very nice."}
{"text":"5 stars for service. They treat you like gold here. The price is fantastic. I LOVE the salsa and you get it free with a nice set of perfectly salted chips. Great options for vegetarians which always scores brownie points in my book. Los Cabos is a formidable addition to a block that already includes greats like Brillo Box and Taste of India."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and it's about as close to California mexican as I'm gonna get here in pittsburgh. HOWEVER. Their carne asada fries are always a disappointment and I've pinpointed why! They just need to use thinner cut fries! That's it! If they fixed that I would come EVERYDAY"}
{"text":"Not a fan and i don't really think my meal fit a SoCal trendy description.  Many of the chips were limp, stale and chewy.  I've read that the salsa was to die for and I'd like to call that bluff.  The relleno burrito was flavorless even in its thin sea of watery sauce.  Seeing Frank's Red Hot sauce on a table instead of some great Mexican hot sauce or something homemade was disappointing.  Plus not an agua fresca in sight.

My search for great Mexican food in the burgh will continue."}

{"text":"I've been here a couple times and hafta say, I like Los Cabos. 

The restaurant is cheerfully decorated. Service is relatively and the staff is very friendly. I even stopped in one night just as it appeared as they were closing up. However, they very happily took my takeout order and I was on my way.

As for the food, it's pretty good. I've had a number of their burritos and soft tacos. I like quesadillas and theirs are no exception. Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand all the rave reviews of this place.  We have been searching for a good Tex-Mex place and based on the reviews, thought we'd try Los Cabos.  Unfortunately, the salsa tastes as though it came from a jar, the chips were greasy and barely crisp, and the rice and beans had little to no taste.  The burrito even tasted like it had been pre-wrapped, frozen, and then re-heated.  Granted, the burrito was huge, but a small delicious burrito would top a giant, bland one any day.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Los Cabos is great! Definitely one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have been eating at Los Cabos for years and they never disappoint. Their food is true authentic mexican food, always delicious and never greasy. Service is always good and food comes out fast. And their prices are very reasonable. 
Some of my favorite dishes are the tilapia fish tacos, the potato taco which comes in a hard shell taco, the fish burrito, chips and salsa (salsa is a bit spicy), and their rice and beans are the best I've had. 
Great for dining in or taking out. They also have outside seating which I go to a lot with my dogs in the summer. 
If you haven't eaten at Los Cabos you're definitely missing out."}
{"text":"Very casual, very good food. Authentic so-cal-mex chile rellenos, excellent fish tacos.  BYOB."}
{"text":"Okay so Los Cabos is amazing for staying open as late as it does #1.

I came in at around 1:45 with my friend hoping that they wouldn't have started locking up as most places do when its starts to drag toward the end of the night. I waved in at the guy inside he said the were open (YAY)

The menu is a little overwhelming but there are tons of options to choose from. I don't even remember what I had because I told him to surprise me and then I covered my ears when my friend ordered the same thing. 

Ill post a picture of that monstrous delicious burrito. With C.A. written on in sour cream.

It was soooooo good.

Definitely stop by if you're a late night person like me or just hungry from a long night of bar hopping."}
{"text":"Moved here from San Diego a couple of months ago and this is the best Mexican food I've had in Pittsburgh. Check it out!"}
{"text":"How great it is to finally have a Southern Californian style Mexican restaurant here in Pittsburgh. The food is everything in flavor and stands true to a M-experience. Their house made hot sauce is fantastic, ask for it if you want to add to your mexperience. Service was an A-Plus; I see someone reviewed it as having no wait-staff, but, they deliver your food to table and will bus the table as well. This is a place I can't wait to eat my way through the menu. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Tried Los Cabos tonight for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered out, and the experience was overall very pleasant. The food was great, but certainly nothing amazing. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla, which was very good. It came with guac, sour cream, and salsa. The guac and salsa weren't good. Overall, a decent place to go for good priced Mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm from Houston, Texas and Los Cabos is about as good as any Mexican food you would get here in Pittsburgh. Now, its no Tex-Mex, but it is darn good compared to the other mexican fares in and around the 'burgh.
I live down the street from Cabos and have been frequenting the restaurant since it opened. The staff are wonderfully nice and recognize me and my friends when we come in.
Great place all around!!!"}
{"text":"Free chips, pretty cheap, right next to Brillobox, and open until 3am friday and saturday(Tacos and burritos only)? How could you not love this place? The food is decent, my friend raved about his pork, but my Pittsburgh burrito with veggies instead of meat was a bit dry - but with the combination of food how could it not be. Some Tapatio fixed the problem. Also, fries and tartar sauce, a \"pittsburgh\" burrito does not make. The place claims to be so-cal mexican food, and indeed the waitress's truck had a california plate on it - so they seem to be doing alright. 

They also have Carne Asada fries, which was something I thought was cool on the west coast that I hadn't seen here. My girlfriend coerced a meatless version off of the late-night menu which was really delicious - if they fix the sacrilegious pittsburgh burrito and  the yinzers ever find out about nacho fries then Los Cabos will be the mexican Primanti's in no time... In the best way possible"}
{"text":"There's not much in the way of Mexican food in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Cabo is hit or miss. When it's \"hit\" the food is actually pretty decent (although recently I've noticed they've cut down on their portions). When it's \"miss\" you'd think Montezuma himself was in the kitchen. Try your luck. But don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"As a big fan of authentic Mexican food, I was surprised that I haven't been to any in the 'Burgh. Yelp recommended Los Cabos and we set out on a Friday evening to get dinner before drinks. 

You have to order at the counter and they will come serve you where you are seated. The staff were very warm and extremely polite. I was very happy to see they have tamales as an option. We ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was fresh, with a fine blend of tomatoes and shredded cheese on it. It was a big portion and tasted reasonable, but definitely not one of those -will die for it- guac. We ordered the combination meals and I got the enchilada and chille releno. The enchilada was perfect, and the sauce was fresh and flavorful. The chille releno was good too! We also got the tamale and oh man, it was great! Having become a recent fan of tamales, I was so happy to find good tamales in Pittsburgh.

Will definitely come back here to get dinner/take out again."}
{"text":"For a reasonably priced casual place the food is great. Beef tamale was solid.

When you get a combo, you can add another item for a buck."}
{"text":"Darren and I came here last week, and I loved their taco platter. The interiors are modern, ethnic, and hip. I could see this becoming a go-to place for us since Darren works in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

The menu is pretty close to one you'd find in a Southern California Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa and tacos were good, but overall the food was a bit bland. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it. 

It's really cool that they're BYOB! Paid and non-paid street parking available."}
{"text":"Stopped for a Latin Lunch. I think this is primarily Mexican- American food. Socal, Tex it's all the same to me for the most part. I decided on the chiliquiles because with the egg, it's a healthier type of meal. It's a newer reastaurant too. 

I opened the container and there was this kind of oily pile of tortilla mush with some sauce and lot's of seasonings. I was so hungry so I started eating but it was not the good spice I look for. It just seemed that they added too much heat to the dish, it was all I could taste. As for the egg?? I didn't see any. I ate enough to lose my hunger pangs but would not order that item again. 

My lunch partners ordered tacos, a fish salad, and a taco salad that all looked better than my choice. I know the office will order from there again so next time I will try the fish salad."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that I love tacos so much that I embroidered one onto the back of my hoodie that I wear all the time. I emblazoned an item of my clothing with a taco... a hand stitched taco... yeah.

When I heard that a new Mexican restaurant was opening in my neighborhood I was so stoked I did a little dance. (Just as an fyi: the dance usually involves me shaking my butt and jumping up and down from one leg to the other. If you want to picture it please enjoy yourself at my expense.)

My first experience with them wasn't so stellar though. I stopped on my way home and picked up two shredded chicken burritos and a single beef taco. I walk everywhere and by the time I got home with my food purchases: 1. The awful giant styrofoam containers were all broken and sauce like liquid was leaking out of them. & 2. The burritos were sort of... squishy? I don't know if that's the right word. They were... mushy. That's it. They had just been too drenched with sauce. They still tasted great though and both my boyfriend and I loved it. Not to mention they're so big they're two meals for me.

My second/third/fourth (you get the idea) trips have been great. We've been trying different burritos and I'm about ready to move onto some combo plates, horchata, and tacos.

The girl working the front is (beautiful) always incredibly friendly and the interior is cheerful, bright, and clean. My only disappointment is that they're not open Sundays for my Mexican brunch fix."}
{"text":"I met the original owner, Joel, who would not ever have served watery re-fried beans.  Aside from that George (Jorge) the new owner has worked hard to own this piece of an authentic Mexicali  franchise.  My personal recommendation is the combo \"with one extra\" -- cheese enchilada, rolled tacos and the tamale.  Also, don't overlook the pollo floutas!!  A special request, but it's my favorite at a restaurant such as this.  Great salsa.  Mix the hot and mild for a real treat!  Make sure to eat in, rather than take out, as you get free chips + salsa."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican? Check out this tasty spot in Lawrenceville for reasonably-priced, quick, high-quality grub. You order at the counter and then sit down at any table and they'll bring your food when it's ready. They'll also bring you complimentary chips and salsa....and their salsa is awesome! It actually has flavor and spiciness (imagine that!), unlike a lot of other Mexican restaurants that serve watery tomato chunks and call it salsa. 

For my meal on a recent visit, I got a combo plate with two enchiladas (one chicken and one cheese), rice, and beans. My husband opted for a California burrito, which has fries in the middle (apparently this is a style of burrito popular in San Diego...who knew that putting fries in random foodstuffs was NOT just a Pittsburgh thing?!)  Anyway, the food came out quickly and was stellar. No complaints from either of us. Everything was fresh, had a lot of flavor, and the portions were generous. I think I've found my new go-to when I'm looking for quick Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food lover. My boyfriend is not. It's quite upsetting to me because it limits the restaurants we go to. With that being said, I have found a place that he is willing to visit! We've been to Los Cabos about two or three times now and were left impressed after each visit. 

It's not a traditional sit down restaurant. You order at the front counter and they will bring you the food. The dining room is decent size, but nothing special. Their is Spanish/Mexican decor and they have Univision playing on the TV. There was only one of other table dining during our last visit. I have a feeling more people get their orders to go. However, if you eat-in, you get chips and salsa for free! Yippie!

The food and value here is unbeatable! I always get the combo meal. For around $10 you get your choice of two items (like a tamale and enchilada), beans and rice. It is a huge dish for a great price! Everything tastes authentic and delicious! I think my favorite dish is their cheese enchilada. My boyfriend likes their chimichangas. We usually end each meal with fried ice cream (because why wouldn't we?). Yummy! I'm getting hungry just typing this. Once again, the portion is huge and well worth the $5. 

Service is always very friendly and you can tell they truly appreciate the business. During our last visit, the cook accidentally made me a cheese enchilada instead of the beef one I asked for. Rather than throwing the cheese one out, they let me keep both! It's things like that, that patrons remember and keep us coming back for more. 

Only reason I'm not giving them the full five stars, is because their hours are sort of weird. On Yelp, they are listed as staying open till 10PM on weekdays. However, we've tried to go between 9PM-10AM only to find that the doors are locked and lights were off. I don't know if Yelp has incorrect information or they're one of those businesses that shuts down at a different time every night depending on business."}
{"text":"This was a good week for food.

Great Mexican food, I think I'm swayed by free salsa and chips. For a place that isn't really conducive to sitting down and eating (seems less like a restaurant and more like a takeout) I was surprised by the presentation of the food as well as the pleasant service.  It had all the benefits of being a quick to go restaurant and a proper sit down. 

+Speedy 
+Cheap
+Huge portions to last for days
+Pleasant staff 
+Complementary chips and salsa (really got me) 
+Relatively Clean and Quiet 
+Convenient 

Nothing to hate."}
{"text":"I try not to make concrete judgments about restaurants in their first year of operation; the learning curve in the industry is steep and lots of things will be changing in those first 365 days (I also try to visit a place more than twice before reviewing it-we all have bad days). With that in mind, Los Cabos, which has been around for a month or two, hasn't blown me away. But that doesn't mean they won't someday.

For now though, my friend nailed it when he said, \"They aren't solving any of the problems with the Mexican food scene in Pittsburgh,\" after having a \"meh\" burrito there.*   

Two thing at Los Cabos make it feel slightly more authentic than other popular Mexican restaurants like Round Corner Cantina or Mad Mex; free chips and salsa (always nice) and horchata (a deceptively simple rice milk drink with cinnamon and sugar--otherwise known as heaven on earth in its best versions, which isn't to be found here). 

Do chips and a tasty aqua fresca elevate this place to a level of authenticity thus unparalleled in the Iron City? Hardly, but their tacos are pretty good.

One pork belly taco will run you around $3, which is kind of crazy considering that's more expensive than the ones you get in the touristier Strip at Reynas, but these ones are way better. The pork belly was a little more belly fat than pork, but the flavoring was knock-out, as was the seasoning on the pollo, and carne asada. And they were mostly meat. Yay!

The walls are a disorienting mix of deep purple, bubble-gum pink and sunshine yellow. I usually like the way over-saturated colors kind of automatically lift my serotonin, but bad lighting make the restaurant feel dim overall. There's not much in the way of decorations, but the wall as you walk in features a big ass menu that's so expansive it would make Lewis and Clark think twice. So, again, although tacos are the litmus test for Mexican restaurants in my mind, I'm not going to pretend like Los Cabos and I won't be meeting again, and again, and again.

*Let it be known that I think there are plenty of awesome Mexican restaurants in PGH, but that there's also lots of room for improvement: restaurateurs, are you listening?!"}
{"text":"They say hunger is the best chef... That may be true, however I was starving and this place was still terrible. The salsa tasted like watered down Prego.    I will say that the people working were so nice I would maybe go back."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place saved my life. CARNE ASADA FRIES!!!!!!!! Do you want authentic SoCal Mexican food? Then eat at Los Cabos! When I moved away from Riverside, I thought I'd never get Carne Asada Fries again. I'm SO glad I'm wrong. (By the way, you wanna question my creds on this? Go through my reviews and you'll see years old reviews about my favorite carne asada fries joints. Seriously, trust me on this one.)

You know how Mad Mex says they're \"CaliMex\"? Psht NO. THIS is what mexican food in SoCal tastes like. I was so happy and impressed that I asked to meet the owners. They were so sweet and happy to talk with me. 

Also, their Chile Relleno is legit. I always judge my Mexican restaurants by their Chile Rellenos. It should be a poblano pepper stuffed with gooey hot cheese, battered and fried in a fluffy coating, covered again with cheese, and smothered in red sauce. Los Cabos hits this on every point.

Expect authenticity, expect a lot of spice, expect a divey feel (bc that is authentic and best), and expect yummy greasy food.

Also, BYOB!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food!

I was in the neighborhood and decided to give this one a go. The California Burrito was really yummy! I had a less exciting chicken one but it was still pretty good. The price was fair and the place was clean. 

I think I will go here again."}
{"text":"Los Cabos is amazing. A-MAZING. Everything I've had there is good, and I try to order a different menu item every time I go (the menu is huge). The bean and cheese burritos are the best standby and insanely cheap at $2.99. The food is wonderful, but the people who work here knock it up to 5 stars. My friends and I have a tendency to forget what time it is and stay past closing, and they are always so great about it. We once shot a champagne cork into the kitchen by accident and they could not have been more gracious (it probably didn't hurt that we gave them some of the champagne). Even if you don't like the food, take a group and a six pack to Los Cabos and I guarantee you'll have a good time. 

Oh, and please tip well! You tip at the counter when you order, so don't forget to drop these ladies and gents a little love on your way out, they definitely earn it."}
{"text":"Great place in Lawrenceville - just across the street from Children's!

Menu is a bit overwhelming, but nothing different from most mexican places - there are infinite ways you can mix it up with different proteins and sides here! Food has always been awesome whenever I've been here - proper portions (not too big, but not too small either...) served at the correct temperature, and full of wonderful flavor. My personal favorite - carnitas burrito. Good GOD, it is delicious!

Chips and salsa or guac are great - I've always liked chatting with the owners about their business; it's clear they have a passion for this, and I am always happy to do my part to keep their dream alive by enjoying their awesome food.

I know everyone loves BYOB, but I will say this - having Corona, Negra Modelo, or Simpatico in the fridge would bump you up a star in my book!

Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"When anyone asks about Mexican food in the city and someone starts to say Mad M--smack them (unless you're just trying to get a bigazz marg!). And then bring them here.

This place is that So-Cal Mex done perfectly, filling my rather pathetic size self with a burrito larger than any (and have been doing so for at least the last five years). I used to even trek here from the South Hills for my shredded chicken before moving to the East End. A pilgrimage from a south 'burgher is rare. Between the family running the place that is constantly here with sincere, friendly service, and the enchilada sauce (yes, seriously, just this sauce by itself), you can't get better.

Enchilada sauce. I could live off this stuff. I've had enchiladas elsewhere and been like, cool, tomatoes. But this! Red gold. It covers the huge, tender shredded chicken burrito that shares its huge shell with corn, lil' peps, rice, green beans, and is totally finished by me every time.. and these are massive. Those shredded burritos are under the radar it seems.  Everyone else gets the beefy Pittsburgh burrito, which I have to salute if only for the use of french fries.

You also get to begin your meal with their salsa and chips, and while free, are also some of the best. I do think they make everything themselves and will not believe any word otherwise. My only draw back is trying to stop by for late night, and they are often already closed before the listed hour. Maybe I just like the chase.. The elusive burrito. Good to note a few of the local food delivery services will also drop off your puppy sized lunch to the surrounding neighborhoods.

I can't compare it to others anywhere in the area (maybe a joint or two while living in AZ, but that's a given). Not saying Western PA is a hot spot for Mexi, but we hit a gold mine here. This is a Penn Ave sauce covered gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night since I was in a mood for some good Mexican food. The location is very close to Children's Hospital so maybe this is why the food seemed to be bland. Nothing bad but I was expecting more depth of flavor."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good. The burritos are incredible. The quesadillas are delicious. I honestly don't know why the reading is so mediocre. I've never had any poor experiences and always love the food. The prices are a little high in my opinion, but still worth the deliciousness in my mouth. The California Surfin burrito is amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I realize that doesn't necessarily say much, but this is the closest I've had to West coast style Mexican food since moving here in November. It's no wonder,  the owner is from California. 

Great burritos. Especially the chorizo con huevos, which I've yet to find anywhere else in the Steel City."}
{"text":"I've found, to my disappointment, that Pittsburgh and Mexican food generally don't mix. Let me give you a heads up and say that I did recently move from TX, so make of my comment what you will. However, having moved from TX, I feel like my opinion should count for something, right? ; ) 

I always order a chicken quesadilla from all the new Mexican restaurants I try. It's my go to dish for determining whether I'll be back. While other Mexican(y) restaurants here have failed to deliver on the quesadilla front, Los Cabos has not. Their chicken quesadilla was nicely flavored and had a crispy tortilla shell....just the way they served it in TX! Granted, it's probably not the best tasting quesadilla I've ever had, but it's definitely the best I've tried in Pittsburgh! I also appreciate that they throw in a free basket of chips and salsa with your order (what's with the whole charging for a basket of chips? I've never seen that until I moved here!). I've tried their queso and while it wasn't bad tasting, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was more of a salsa/cheese mix than a creamy, thick, cheese sauce. I think I'll pass on the queso next time I'm there and try their guac instead. 

If you go, just keep in mind this place is more of a order at the front, seat yourself, grab your own drink kind of place (think Panera) instead of an actual sit down restaurant with a bar. So while I'm still in search of a great tasting Margarita here in the 'Burgh, I at least know exactly where to go to get my fill of Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food ranges between good and just OK. I like it as a wheel deliver option except that the consistency is terrible. Sometimes you'll pay for a side of fries and get about 10, other times a nice-sized container. Same with the side of sour cream. It'll be $0.50 for a teaspoon half the time. Food quality is similarly inconsistent I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if they learned to be consistent."}
{"text":"Saw them scoop their guac out of a container, so guess they don't do much in house. Which was awkward considering it was grey and brown, soooo guess because it was a to-go item, they gave us the old stuff.   I got the carne Asada burrito... Is this a steakum?  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A gem of this city. If you understand and appreciate southwest-style Mexican food, you'd wanna give this place 6 stars. Honestly, I have not had a better burrito outside of Southern California or Arizona than what I get at Los Cabos. (And I've lived in Chicago, Texas and all over the east coast). With that said, if you're looking for a trendy date night/ hot spot, this is probably not it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already, and I really enjoy it. First of all,the staff is friendly. I appreciate that a lot more than quality of food even. Their system of ordering at the counter and sitting is also enjoyable to me. 

I've tried their quesadilla and Veggie tacos as well as Veggie burrito. It's all pretty basic but delicious. I think they taste even better as leftovers. Their food is very affordable and the portions are generous. I always have leftovers. 

I would say their food is pretty authentic too, but it lacks the spice and complexity I'm used to. That's probably because they are catering to a certain kind of demographic in Pittsburgh and not a reflection of their cooking skills. 

I'll be going here a lot more in the future!"}
{"text":"There food was sub-par for authentic Mexican food. My veggie burrito was not what I expected it to be and it lacked any real flavor or seasoning."}
{"text":"Decent burritos and tacos, but nothing to write home about.  One of the better mexican places in Pittsburgh (in terms of both taste and value), but there's not much competition...

The staff is always super friendly.  Great for post-brillo late-night snacking (the food tastes AWESOME if you have a few drinks in you...)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through them from Wheel Delivery, so I can't attest to the atmosphere of the actual restaurant, but the food was decent. I moved here from San Diego a few months ago and it's been hard to find Mexican food that's been up to par. That being said, that's the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me- I'm conditioned to knowing what authentic Mexican food tastes like, and it wasn't quite at that level.

BUT ...I think it's a good substitute and the best I've had in Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely be ordering from them again.

Pros:
Fresh tortillas
Great salsa
Big menu with west coast options

Cons:
Fish tacos pretty much fall apart in your hands (although they're delicious)
Carne asada in the California burrito was a bit too much like ground beef
Bacon in breakfast burrito was undercooked and fatty"}
{"text":"One night last week, Kay napped too late and forgot to make dinner. When she picked me up from work, she impatiently said, \"We need to eat out! Pick a place! Hurry! I have a starvation migraine!\"

I had suddenly been put on the spot! I did remember that a Mexican restaurant had recently opened across from where St. Francis Hospital (my former employer) used to be, and I hadn't been there yet (blame Yelp!), so to Penn Avenue we drove. 

After finding a safe spot on the street, we walked over to find something that came off as a Taco Bell given a massive, upmarket upgrade. 

They've also crafted the zenith of taco salads in what they call the Los Cabos Supreme Tostada. 

It is everything SoCal Mexican inside a flaxen and flaky tostada basket, just like many a chain makes, and not a single component, from the guacamole, crema, and shrimp to the ground beef skipped a beat or was wasted. If you are short on dough, split this with someone, and you'll both come away from it stuffed as well as gratified. I needed nothing else to go with it. 

With such south-of-the-border fare in Pittsburgh, I must say to Taco Bell...well, I'll just let James and his pals push the clapper at the top of the cathedral for me...

{"text":"At first when I heard about Los Cabos, I was so excited to see a new Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. After 2+ years of being open, the \"Now Open\" sign is STILL on the front of the restaurant. You would think they'd invest in a neon sign if they have any plans to stick around.

Their food quality has gone down significantly since they first opened, and their hours have been cut - this eliminates a lot of business that comes from the late-night Brillo crowd. 

In terms of their food, eat vegetarian there. Anything with pollo asado is dry and flavorless. The carne asada usually full of gristle and fat. The carnitas are alright. Funny enough, the chorizo is the only meat I would trust, since it doesn't come from Sysco. Even if you avoid meat dishes here, the veggie burrito can be hit or miss. When it's good, it's got tons of colorful sliced veggies. When they're hitting the bottom of the veggie pile, the veggies are really on their way out. Can't be serving rotten food to paying customers, no matter how drunk they are.

That said, the fish tacos are pretty great. Slather it up with Tapatio, and you've got some serious flavor! 

Eduardo is the best. He el salvador and el patron of Los Cabos."}
{"text":"How hard is it to make Mexican Food filled with flavor?  Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult - rice, beans, tortilla shells...but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands.
I tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos.  Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries...maybe  a little cheese.  No Guac, no salsa to be seen.  I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1/2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice.  The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch.
My friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department - he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans.
So no matter how late or drunk you are - pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos."}
{"text":"As a native San Diegan I had to rush over to this restaurant when I heard the owners were from my old stomping grounds.  Unfortunately, the food was not as great as I was hoping for.  It seemed to lack basic seasoning.  The rice was okay until I added salt then WOW it was delicious.  

I ordered the rolled tacos and was disappointed with the guacamole that came on top.  It seems they decided to use the avocados that are more commonly found here on the East Coast (I guess?) where they generally lack flavor and are a lot cheaper than Haas avocados.  Tsk-tsk.  Don't give up flavor for money!  

Also ordered carne asada tacos which were pretty darn tasty.  I would recommend ordering anything with carne asada as they clearly know how to cook their meat. 

The cost was a little pricier than I would expect in California but right around what taco shops seem to charge here.  

I would come back and give the carnitas a try.

Vegetarians/Vegans: The rice and beans are all vegetarian.  They also have a veggie burrito which comes with rice, beans, and some vegetable medly which includes carrots and zucchini.  I didn't try it but it sounded interesting.

For the owners: Maybe you should consider staying open until 2am.  It's right next to brillobox and I would love to one night stumble out of brillobox and stuff my face with a burrito."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  I had pretty high expectations based on reviews and was sadly let down.  I really don't understand the hype of the older reviews.  Something must have changed.  

For what it's worth, Taco Bell has better food and this place makes chipotle look like fine dining. There is a major lack of flavor.  Everything was dry and bland.  I asked for a side of rice and beans and they put it inside the burrito.  The $12 overpriced overfilled burrito looked so sad all alone on the plate.   Seriously who charges $12 for a burrito with no sides?

It's also worth noting they don't serve alcohol, and Mexican without beer should be a crime.  My co worker ordered a combo platter and although it looked good he also complained of a lack of taste.  

I know I'll never return here and I'd suggest you pass as well."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican-American food at a decent price.  Not the best I've had, but not the worst.

The service is excellent (as it typically is at Mexican restaurants), all of the employees are very nice and attentive.

Not much more to say..."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good \"Mex\" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. 
First, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the \"California Surfing\" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. 
The only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. 
It's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. 
I have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now."}
{"text":"No. Just no. I make better Mexican food in my own white girl kitchen. 

I ordered the chicken hard tacos and the chicken cubes were just boiled and had zero flavor. The pico di gallo was also pretty tasteless since the tomatoes were a whitish-pink color. 

The guacamole wasn't too bad, bit it had the under-ripe tomatoes from the pico in it. 

Mr. J's carnitas taco looked like it was all fat and the soft tortilla was soaked in grease."}
{"text":"Whenever I get the hankering for Mexican, I'm always left disappointed wherever I venture in Pittsburgh. BUT BUT BUT that will no longer be the case now that I've found Los Cabos. 

I happened upon Los Cabos by accident. The first time I went I ordered the shredded chicken burrito -- SO SO SO GOOD. I've also got an exceptional bean tostada. there. (I've also had an underwhelming chicken taco, but, five stars nonetheless for service and for the excitement of finally finding good mexican). 

Also, reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"With my deep love of Mexican food, I'm surprised I hadn't made it here yet.  Glad I finally made the trip because it was well worth it!

The menu is huge with lots of your favorites peppered in with some very Americanized accents (burrito's with fries inside, holy American batman!).  I choose the shrimp burrito.  Here's the key to a fantastic shrimp burrito, and it's a simple one.  Don't scrimp on the shrimp!

Good thing they know me (they don't) because it was PACKED with big juicy shrimp!  Not even those puny frozen kind, the real deal!  I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with the shrimp, plus rice, beans and cheese.  Delicious!  

But I must admit the star of the show for me was the guacamole.  Gauc seems like it would be so simple to make yet it's so easy to mess up.  Too mushy, no taste, etc.  This gauc was the real deal!  It was probably the best gauc I've sampled at a Mexi restaurant in the city!  There, I said it!  I'd come here just to sample some chips and gauc if I was craving it (or not craving it and just loving it!).  

I'm also currently in love with the Jarritos Pineapple Mexican soda drink, which they carry.  So I'll be grabbing me a soda and gauc here in the near future, don't you worry!!"}
{"text":"My first gross burrito.  :( rice tasted over cooked,  and sure enough i ended up taking a bite of congealed rice and tomato paste. Lots of lettuce,  not enough beans. The guac tasted like extra soft avocado: no tomato,  onion, jalepeno nor lime. Nor any pico."}
{"text":"My always happy to see a new Mexican Restaurant in town. The service was fast and friendly and the guacamole was good. Unfortunately, the chile rellenos were small and covered in way too much breading. I'll probably stop back if in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I do like the shrimp burrito and was happy they carried Jarritos Tamarindo, which is my favorite. The price makes this place and the quick service make this  a well made fast food place. As much as I liked it I didn't really love it and would just as easily go to Qdoba or Chipotle."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. The tacos are to die for as well as the chips and salsa. The service was fast albeit a little weird where you order at the counter then your food is brought out to you. I loved the tamale so very much, one of the best in the city hands down. The only thing I didn't like was the beans, they were just too bland and soupy for me. I would definitely visit again and again."}
{"text":"The carne asada fries are pretty good. So I do go every now and then for them. Last time I went I decided to try to the fried ice cream.
It was not fried ice cream... they tricked us. they used CEREAL to give it that \"crunchy-fried\" feel but it wasn't fried, which was super disappointing. 

Also, there's no salsa bar which is freakin strange.
How is there no salsa bar?"}
{"text":"I stopped in today because I was tired of the hospital food across the way and had been eyeing up their food on here.  It's a very intimate place without any hint of intimacy.   Saying it is tiny and lacks atmosphere is a more accurate representation.   I got my food to go so maybe the real flair is in the presentation of the meals.  I ordered the fish tacos, the carne asada fries and an order of churros for a total of 23.00 and change.  The carne asada fries looked great with the exception of the guacamole.   I'm not a huge fan of guacamole but at times I'll try it when it looks fresh and chunky.  This stuff was thin and watery which made it very tough to remove from the meal.  The remainder was good but nothing spectacular.  The fish tacos got mixed reviews but I found them to be better than expected.  I would certainly have them again.  The refried beans and rice that came with them were also very good.  The highlight of the meal was the churros.   It's just a shame that an order is only 3 pieces because I would of bought a second order if I had known.  Don't judge me for that.  I'm sure this place has a few highlight dishes and if it was closer to my home I'd be tempted to try a few more items and see what gems they have to offer."}
