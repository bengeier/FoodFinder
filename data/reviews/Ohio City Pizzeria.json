{"text":"I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, and pepper rings. It was excellent and was delivered hot and on time. I love me some Ohio City Pizza."}
{"text":"The three cheese pizza with black olives and onions from Ohio City Pizza is my favorite Cleveland pizza. Even better if you add bacon to the order.  I recommend ordering for pick up for two reasons. 1. you get to talk to Birdie who is often the one making you pizza. Even though another reviewer referred to her as a pirate, I have always found her to be friendly and fun. 2. sometimes they overcook pizzas but that doesn't seem to happen when you pick it up on time."}
{"text":"Note: The only poor rating should be taken with a large grain of salt....  Been coming here ever since I moved from NY. The woman that worked there full time was diagnosed with cancer and is recovering I found out. Her name is Birdy or Bertie. This is the woman who is accused of being too \"stoned\" to cook pizza. She was definitely a personality but is a good hearted person.   The young girls covering her shifts indefinitely do an amazing job and it's like the pizza gets better every time I go.      They had a hiccup on an order and gave me a free pizza for having to wait longer than was said when I went in for a pickup order. The Two Mediums for 10 bucks is my favorite deal they offer. They also have some creative and delicious combination. Check em out and support local business in Ohio City!  P.S they only overcook pizzas when you call in for an order right before close. They usually have to turn everything back on and turn the oven up high so they can go home just like anyone wants to go home after working long hours I'm sure."}
{"text":"Average pizza in a great location! The affordable price goes hand in hand with low quality ingredients. The size and amount of toppings are very generous on the pizzas, and the garlic bread is perfect.    My favorite aspect is the delivery, however the last three times I ordered it took over an hour for the delivery, and the pizza was cold."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and the quick delivery! The girl who answers the phone is the rudest person I have ever spoke to. She must be related to someone....it's the only explanation as to why she still has a job!"}
{"text":"I wanted some pizza on my way home, and not some chain pizza. A quick search for a local pizza place landed me at Ohio City Pizzeria.   Now I'll admit the outside of this place was not the most inviting, but the people were pleasant. They were happy for the business and very polite.   The two medium pizzas for $10 is a great deal. Way better than two Little Caesars pizzas would be for the same price. I ordered my pizzas and less than 15 minutes later was walking out the door with some hot amazing food.   If I lived closer this would be my pizza place of choice. As it stands if I'm in the area I'll be picking up a pie."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Looks like a hole in the wall but if deserves a chance. This is the best pizza I've found in Cleveland yet.  Good prices for the pies and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My long time favorite pizza place!!! I have been getting pizza from Ohio City for years and never disappointed!!! My favorite is double ground beef, double cheese, mushrooms and jalape√±o peppers. It is awesome! Not many places offer ground beef as a topping. They do and they do it well!!"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the first time, got their Ohio City Favorite which consists of provolone, romano & cheddar cheese, bacon and onions with red sauce, large pizza and was $18.50. It does seem a bit expensive but the pizza was delicious. We picked up the pizza, it's a small place, you can eat there but it seems like the majority of their business is carry out or delivery. Will definitely eat this pizza again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. The sauce is savory and the cheese is thick. Great crispy crust. Amazing price."}
{"text":"no thanks, cardboard is too high in fiber for me.  too much fiber.    ...you see where i'm going with this?  ....yep."}
{"text":"The pizza there is decent but the customer service is what left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought it was just me, but after reading some of these reviews, a patten of disrespect and a lack of appreciation for ones customer base is clear! Was a customer hear for years but will never again return and would not recommend putting up with the attitude in exchange for mediocre pizza"}
{"text":"On approaching the entrance to this place, I was initially unimpressed by the fact that the screen door to enter was locked and one has to ring the bell to have someone let you in.  In order to give the place a fair shake and also to use my day off from being supervegan, I ordered a little bit of everything.   The wings: Great! Breaded but just the right size and breaded and cooked just right  The salad: It's just salad but the cheese used was great. Got a over-ripe tomato in the salad but otherwise it was fresh.  The meatball sub: YUMMMMM!!! Just the right amount of toasting on the bun. Cheese was ridiculous! Sauce had that hint of sweetness. Meatballs were good. Just a great overall experience there.   Pizza: It was ok and I think it would be more than ok if one orders extra sauce. Crust was just right (for me) and items seemed fresh."}
{"text":"The food here is actually a \"3\" but the service is a \"0\". I asked if they delivered to the Hampton Downtown and they didn't know where its located (how many can there possibly be?). I told them on 9th street but that wasn't good enough. Had to go online to get the address for them. Then I got a call from the driver, \"I'm here\" wouldn't bring it to my door, wouldn't even bring it inside. I had to walk out to the car parked at the curb to get my food. CRAZY. I'd probably try someone else if I were you."}
{"text":"*AMENDMENT*  Ok I am amending my review due to the fact that I've now been in Cleveland almost 3 years and our experience with OCP has gone completely downhill. The pizza is still \"ok\" but over time has gotten greasier and greasier. I think the fact that they put the 'za on wax paper, which doesn't absorb anything, causes the grease puddle - however, I'm not claiming to be a scientist.   The reason for the 1 star rating is as follows: Someone who works at OCP gave out our personal contact information to a delivery driver. My boyfriend started receiving text messages FROM THE PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER on a social level on nights that WE HAD NOT ORDERED A  PIZZA. Creepy as shit, right? Right. Needless to say we haven't ordered pizza from there again... (shudders).  ++++++++++++++++++++++  My boyfriend and I just moved from Chicago and have really become accustomed to thin crust pizzas. Actually I'd consider myself a pizza snob, so the task of finding a new pizza joint in my area seemed rather daunting. I was told to try Ohio City Pizzeria, so I figured we should start setting them up and knocking them down as quickly as possible.   The woman on the phone was extremely nice. When I asked if they made 'thin crust pizzas' she said she could make it as thin as possible, which was fine by me. I ordered my pizza and it was delivered to our apt in Tremont in 45 min. Everything went smoothly and the pizza was really good.   I'd also like to add that they have green olives as a topping option and apparently that isn't a standard topping in Cleveland, so they get brownie points for that as well.   I can't speak to the actual establishment because I've only had delivery.   We've been in Cleveland for 1 month and have ordered pizza from OCP 2x already. I'm definitely going call them again."}
{"text":"Get real if you think this is edible. That chick who makes the pizza with a bird name is always too stoned to even cook. THIS PIZZA IS ROTTEN."}
{"text":"Mmm...  Pizza and sweat.  THE UP-SIDE: The pizza here is pretty good.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  Questionable surroundings.  In the summer I've watched giant beads of glistening sweat roll off the male cook's head and nearly splash land on my pizza.  Thus, I never go in summer any longer.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Eh.  Not bad but a little gross at times.  Sorta like all of Ohio City.  (And I can say that 'cuz I'm from here.)"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had. I'd rather have pizza from pizza hut."}
{"text":"I'm giving this joint an extra star, since friggin Domino's won't deliver to Ohio City.  Went here on my first night as a resident of Ohio. The gal behind the counter was really sweet, she greeted us all warmly and ended up talking with my stepmother for about ten minutes.  The pizza was good. No problems. Not spectacular, but...after a while, spectacular pizza grows a bit tiresome. This is good pizza, will fill you up, and doesn't cost a ton. It's perfect for where it is (which is a 3-5 minute walk from my house...which is great).  Hopefully, the snobs on the other side of Lorain won't force them to change their name (I've been informed, quite snottily, that I don't live in Ohio City...folks North of Lorain Avenue almost have a stroke if you suggest that South of Lorain is also Ohio City).  Either way, they have pizza...it's not crappy NY Style, it's actually decent (yes, I've been to all the NY Pizza joints, tried it all). They have coca-cola. You don't need much else for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Come ON!   Maybe I'm not getting what Yelp is about. Is it supposed to be an \"experience\" rating or something? Or are you supposed to (attempt to) objectively evaluate the quality of the food we're reviewing? Cause this food is shit. I ordered it a few times when I first moved here and never again. I've had the pepperoni sheet pizza at a local bar and I'll only eat it cause it's Sunday night and I've probably been partying.   Doesn't free pizza usually taste the best? Not when it's from OCP.   Super salty or they put tons of onion powder in the sauce, I don't know what it is but it makes my stomach hurt, badly. Two pieces of this stuff has prematurely ended my evening more than once, I vow not to do it to myself anymore, even if its free.   I continue to lament the lack of an even passable pizza place that's actually in Ohio City. There are a few delivery options that are decent, but no real pizza joint.   There are a lot of urban hipsters on here who think that just cause you're independent, you deserve a higher rating. Just try to focus on the food. Do you understand that just blindly \"supporting local business\" often means that you're perpetuating mediocrity?"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so this is our go-to pizza place when we don't want to support a chain. The pizza looks just like the pictures that are posted, and has been delivered hot every time. The only complaint, is that one time we ordered a dozen wings (they are delicious, breaded and the sauce comes on the side) and there were only 8 in the box when we opened it at home."}
{"text":"I used to like their pizzas, but twice already I couldn't get in! First time, I get a rude employee saying that we aren't open! And tonight I rang the doorbell twice and I was ignored!  And another thing...why did you stop serving bacon on pizzas?"}
{"text":"I've said it once and I'll say it again: If you can deliver hot 'zza to my face without me moving off my ass, you're awesome in my book.   And if you take my credit card over the phone, you're even better!  They're only open late-ish, but they're super-friendly, local and, do I really need to go on? I can't say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's a hell-a-va lot better than chain-imo's and greasy hut. Plus you get the warm fuzzies of supporting local business.   I would stay away from the salad. It's huge, don't get me wrong, but it's a whole lot of what you don't want. For one, I don't like 3lbs of cheese on my salad and it's got to be fresh. And trust me, this thing weighs 3lbs. Also, lose the canned mushrooms. Is it really that much more expensive to have fresh ones? I can't handle those rubbery, soggy things on my 'zza.  Beyond that, they'll deliver you fresh, hot, cheesy pizza to your door and fast. Oh, and they have grape and orange pop!"}
{"text":"I had a mushroom and cheese pizza delivered.  The mushrooms were cannd, which I actually prefer, and there were lots of them.   The cheese was thick, not too greasy,  and not over seasoned.  The sauce was decent, meaning nothing that stuck out to me as exceptionally bad or good,  but that is where any goodness ends.  I'm from ny and I've only have one pizza in ohio that had a passable crust.   This was not it.  1.  Crust was covered in grease like PH 2.  There was not a lot on the edges of the pizza and what was was crispy or incredibly greasy. 2.  The crust below the pizza was thick and way too greasy.     Overall a very poor showing.  I will never go back"}
{"text":"Sad to have to update my review on this place... HUGE decline since this past Summer. No longer our favorite local pizza place. The pizza does not taste or look the same, even though they said it hasn't changed. My mouth and eyes tell me otherwise.   Also, the service has went dooooooown. Like, into the gutter. A few weeks ago, we stopped on the way home to get a pie. I rang the doorbell THREE times. I saw two people in the back, but no one came, so we left. This weekend, we thought we'd order, but they didn't answer their phone.   That was probably our last attempt for Ohio City Pizza. If you guys get it together over there, let us know."}
{"text":"Price: It's ridiculously expensive for small pizzas.   Taste: It was overloaded with cheese that the bread/crust could not handle. Much better pizza choices in the Cleveland area, whether you're thinking franchise or local.   Place: No redeeming features whatsoever. It looks sketchy on the inside so I can't imagine what it looks like in the kitchen. While waiting at the counter you'll notice the notes they wrote for themselves based on people who've called in and swore them out or did not pick up their order (understandable that it needs to be tracked, just not sure why it has to be out in the open for new customers). You have to be buzzed in because the surrounding area is full of homeless people."}
{"text":"I've had OCP about 4-5 times at meetings where I volunteer and it's mostly a mixed bag. Most of the time, it's nothing memorable, once or twice, it was very greasy for me, although last week, it was great and the best that I've had from there: plenty fresh veggies on the veggie pizza, more veggies than cheese covering the pizza."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try a new pizza spot for my during the Grammy's cuisine.  I place the order over the phone and was given a pick up time of 35 minutes.  I picked my pizza up and it was suppose to have extra sauce and be well done.  I had to use my own pizza sauce to make up for the dry pizza.  In a pinch the pizza is OK but if you are looking for something a little above average....skip it."}
{"text":"I've tried giving them a few chances every time  I'm just super disappointed. Bad pizza and bad customer service when I tried calling to complaint"}
{"text":"Second time with OCP - Saturday night 7pm - not busy at all other than some family members of someone who worked there having dinner. Ordered a calzone with pepperoni/mushroom and some garlic bread. The calzone had a thick edge which I found to be too much - had it been seasoned or swiped with some garlic butter, it may not have gone to waste. The mushrooms are canned - I prefer fresh, and there wasn't enough pepperoni. *shrug* The garlic bread though - was laughable. It was a hoagie roll, buttered with garlic powder. I probably could have made that at home eh?   We've had pizza from them before and it's meh... As other Yelp reviews have said, if you're just looking for bare bones basics, it'll do. If you want pizza with some flavor and personality, this probably isn't the best bet.   I do want to say regarding their screen door that locks (you have to be buzzed in) there is a VERY good reason for this: I live just around the corner from OCP, and can attest to the fact that there are transient and homeless persons to be watchful of most of the time. OCP is just down from a large social service agency and in fact attached to an interim shelter for women. To be clear, I'm in no way saying that homeless people are in general scary, bad or whatever... I'm saying that if I were a business in this area where there is often one employee working way in the back, I'd darn sure have a door that locked and a buzzer to let me know who's wanting in and why."}
{"text":"Great pizza...especially for the price!! The sauce is thick and a little bit on the sweeter side which is awesome! The crispy crust makes the pizza as well. Definitely will get again!   The pizza place itself looks questionable on the outside but I don't have anything bad to say about the food."}
{"text":"This pizza is so consistently GOOD! For specialty pizza, I go to Edisons in Tremont. But when I want a good pizza without the extra bells and whistles this is easily my favorite spot in CLE. They never fail!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in OC for what, 10 years and for some reason I had a bad impression of OCP.  Stopped there today to pick up a pie and am delighted!  It's got a nice tasting sauce, it's loaded with cheese and the crust is crispy buttery goodness!   We ordered a large sausage, mushroom and when I went to pick it up (30m), it was ready for me and I thought to myself I need to check them out for some other menu items."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I called to talk about my order that was delivered at least an hour and a half late and not completed correctly and the woman hung up on me. I called back and she did the same thing again. Clearly they do not value the repeat customers they have. Will never return and will suggest new customers to never purchase low grade pizza from them."}
