{"text":"Last week, at my buddy's request we hooked up at Fat Cat's for a quick match on Silver Strike. I of course took him to the wood shed (sorry Wes).  First time visiting this place and I gotta say it was very comfortable. Good staff, welcoming and eager to point us in the right direction for our snack selection. Cold beers, reasonable pricing. So I'm thinking were are gonna be good to go.  We tried their grilled shrimp and blacked shrimp. I say...hold the phones, I am a shrimp eater, but really never had a hankering for the dark side (blacken shrimp). Well, blackened shrimp at Fat Cats is well worth it. Wholly cow, what have I been missing! At any rate, the grilled shrimp and blackened were both great, perfectly prepared and oh so good. Off the beaten path this place was, but a great stop for a quick bite to eat. Very comfortable.   Summers look like fun here, corn hole courts out back, enclosed patio with a stage for live music and patio seating w/ umbrellas. Sure to be a good time in Summer 2015!"}
{"text":"We were told that it was once the best place in town......we will try again but not too soon......we hope they will make some changes.  Less than 6 customers the whole time we were there....and we had to wait for the waitress...wait staff very friendly with other people but too busy with conversations to take our order and the wait was not worth the trip.... Cole slaw-plenty of vinegar and salt, but no flavor. Blackened seafood...tasted like it was blackened seasoning NOT blackened on the grill. Wish they would have some broiled fish on the menu....."}
{"text":"I heard good things about the seafood here, but was disappointed at the menu that mainly featured sandwiches and burgers.  The prices seemed a little high for the area as well.  The Bar staff was also very inattentive and talking with friends most of my visit."}
