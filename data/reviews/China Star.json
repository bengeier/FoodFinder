{"text":"Awesome dan dan noodles and spicy beef tendon appetizers. Chongqing chicken is good, though I like sichuan's gourmet's a little bit more. Braised pork belly with eggplant is excellent. A definite place to eat at in north hills!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong for the price. Their food was decent.  A lot of the selections were redundant. If you like shrimp, you will like this place. I can't get enough of their Crab Rangoons!!!! They are huge!  Super good. And oh, don't order coffee, if you like a good cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Cheap place to stop by and grab something to eat. Food is whatever. Stir fry was nasty.  Sushi was great. Workers are nice and don't neglect you.  But the short Asian lady messed up my drink order then got an attitude when I requested the right drink. But for 6.49$ can't beat it"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to takeout. The last 3 times it has been dreadful. The egg rolls were rotten. I mean they were spoiled and black on the inside. The vegetables are also no longer fresh. They used to just put whatever was fresh into the dish but now noting is fresh. We are now in search of good takeout."}
{"text":"Usually get the Hunan Chicken and Hunan Beef. The food is always pretty good for the price and this is my go-to local Chinese food place in the area. The owners are also very friendly!"}
{"text":"This buffet has got to be the most disgusting place in Las Vegas. The restrooms were nasty, the food was cold, the food was mis labeled. The Asian workers didnt seem to care when I told them that food was cold.... I will never visit this nasty buffet again unless I hear that they have cleaned it up and improved the temperature of the food. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kung Bo Dish (chicken), vegetable soup, and a soda. It was AMAZING! Their delivery service is superb!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looked kind of dirty except the tables...not astetically pleasing...Walls were dirty lighting really funky...Not much variety in foods either....some of it not labled at all. ...Couldn't find the cocktail sause for the fried shrimp. ... And who in the right mind boils shrimp then stir fries it with the shell on it? That's complete laziness...you don't eat the shell stupid . The soft serve ice cream had a nasty taste to it like the machine hasn't been cleaned. Never got refills on drinks...they never asked"}
{"text":"Worst chinese buffet I've ever been to. Staff is rude...food is disgusting. They were all out of meet at the Mongolian bbq section... The food they did had was old and after I ate there my stomach was hurting for two days. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Only thing I can say is that it's cheap....there's a reason why!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent for the price, wings are always crispy and rice is fluffy. Good selection, never stale when I've been there. They also have frequent visitor card buy so many of lunch and dinner get one free. How can you beat that?!"}
{"text":"Got the General Tso's here-- Something I get at every Chinese takeout place to gauge the place.  Meat quality is very good with a crunchy but not-too-thick breading. Sauce was thick and had a tang to it, a flavor unexpected in General Tso's but not entirely unwelcome.  I may try this place again, but I don't think it will be a staple in the family."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed in this place. I read some good reviews and thought they would have good food. But from the start, it was a bad experience.   I ordered the Chow Gei Kew and lettuce wrapped chicken.  My husband got the Butterfly shrimp with extra shrimp and crab ragoons.   First we get a call from the place saying that they can't put in extra shrimp because there is no room for them. The shrimp were \"too big\" to fit more in, even though we already paid for it. Since I did it online, I couldn't get a refund for the extra shrimp. The lady said I could call a number to get a refund but I declined. Whatever, $3 is $3.  Why they didn't specify you couldn't get extra in a regular order, I don't know. That should be something they tell you before you order.  The lettuce wrapped chicken was okay, not what I expected but tasted fine. The chicken came separate from the lettuce, so you had to put the two together. The sauce was good though.   My Chow Gei Kew was not as good. As soon as I opened the container I got a very weird smell from it. It wasn't a rotten smell but it was very unpleasant and didn't seem right at all. The chicken tasted fine but the smell was so off putting that I couldn't eat any of it with out smelling it. I don't know if the sauce was rotten or the chicken or vegetables were, but I did not want to eat it anymore after that.   My husbands was fine though. His was pretty much shrimp, bacon and fried egg in a brown sauce. Not very Chinese but he said it was good. Crab Ragoons were okay, nothing special.  He did say that there definitely looked like enough room to put more shrimp in.   Only reason why I gave it two stars not one was because at least my husband liked his food. I don't think we will be ordering from here again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is your typical family run, greasy spoon type Chinese takeout establishment. It is quick and located on my way home from work, so I often stop in if I'm in a hurry for something to take home and eat. I've found the food to be pretty decent and consistent with what I expect from these walk-up takeout counter style restaurants. There are a few tables, but this is really a takeout place.   I'm not sure how well they do in this location given that Pearl of the Orient is about 300 yards away, directly across Van Aken. If they delivered they would probably do a very good business."}
{"text":"China Star has lightly breaded and crispy fried tofu with General Tso sauce, and they will use that tofu style with other sauces if asked to. The Kung Pao tofu is also great, and not too sweet. The vegetables they use are very fresh and seem to be seasonal.   We always order for pick up, and it never takes more than 10-15 minutes. The owner recognizes us by our order and is always very friendly. The restaurant is small and clean, and has a few chairs to wait for you food if needed."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and I wasn't impressed with the food. The atmosphere was typical, clean and the staff were friendly. I looked under the hoods (as advised from previous posts) and there were still a couple mildew spots. Tried a smidgen of everything and nothing tasted fresh. Safe to say I didn't go back for seconds on anything and I'm probably not going to be returning unless of course another free meal is being offered. But even then I'll have to really like the person I'm going for!"}
{"text":"I was told about china star from a fiend of mine who is Chinese, it is where his parents and family go for authentic Chinese food. They have your basic Chinese food and then a separate menu with unique authentic dishes. He always decides to order food I've never tried before. Fish in a hot broth sauce was simply amazing it was almost like a soup. I forget the name. Anyways the food is amazing, the best Chinese joint in Pittsburgh! Now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Just got delivery and didn't love any of the meal.  It was on time (50 minutes) and warm but the rolls are kind of mushy and not super flavorful (I got summer and spider rolls). The wontons were good, but how do you screw up deep fat fried foods? The portions were very large, but I tried both and will be throwing them out, so it doesn't matter and hopefully I'll find another sushi delivery place."}
{"text":"My first review and it's bad. God, I didn't think it was possible to mess Chinese food up but I was in fact wrong. I ordered off Grubhub & they were an hour late. I get the bag and my buffalo sauce is dripping on my egg roll and near my general tsos. Also, the wonton soup is starting to leak as well. I ignore it and decide to dig in. The wonton soup was meh - noodles were skimpy. The egg roll was ok but I felt like they used shrimps you buy at Walmart. The wings were ok if you wanna ignore they weren't spicy at all & the meat was dark.   I now open my general tsos hoping it's good. WRONG. There were 7 pieces of chicken floating in sauce but the sauce had absolutely no taste to it. It wasn't hot or spicy - just bland. The fried rice was the only redeeming part of the meal. I have never thrown away General tsos but today, I did.  Never ordering from here again. 0/5."}
{"text":"As is with most chinese buffet places, it was a zoo and rundown looking inside. The food was mediocre at best with a small sprinkling of highlights...but, not enough to mention. I can't or wouldn't recommend this place at all! I only gave 2 stars because my waitress was friendly, attentive and cute."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot, and plenty of it for the price. Nothing fancy but rock solid on the flavor and quality of the veggies, noodles, rice, and tofu dishes. I'd recommend this place again in a heartbeat. By the way, nobody was actually eating in the restaurant, which was disconcerting, but I figure that everybody was just ordering delivery."}
{"text":"Ill come straight. The food was ok, but the upkeep was horrible. The walls are chipped, there is nasty gunk on the tables and counters, and the bathroom was the worst. It smelled putrid,  the toilets were not flushed, and graffiti was everywhere. The best one was the anarchy symbol on the wall. I know I said the food was fine, all except tge desserts. Dont get the little croissant chocolate thingys. They aee filled with stale whip cream. Eat here if you can deal with sub-par health conditions."}
{"text":"As far as chinese restaurant  are concerned, I would say that China Star is pretty good. Their tofu is always done perfectly. The prices are fair and the delivery is usually reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting first off my son found a hair in his food then we saw a bug when I left the restaurant I lost my lunch never eat here"}
{"text":"Very authentic Sichuan food. Reminds me of my hometown. Friendly staff, always good service . Also a Good choice for family dinner or friends gatherings."}
{"text":"One of my Chinese friends recommended me to China Star. It was fantastic!  The staff was kind and efficient (as Chinese waitstaff tend to be) and the service was relatively fast.  The clientele that day was a nice mix of English-speakers and Chinese-speakers, so that's always a good sign.   I visited China not too long ago, so I decided to order dishes I had eaten there. We ordered it NOT SPICY and they easily accomodated us without sacrificing any flavor!  Don't be afraid to ask.  I decided it was best to eat Chinese-style where all the dishes are shared. As people have said, forgo the American menu and go straight for the Chinese menu. Even better, check out the website and decide what you want beforehand.  I enjoyed all of the food.  We started out with Cold Sesame Noodles, which were swimming in the uniquely-flavored sesame sauce. Note: it doesn't taste like Sesame Chicken, people!    For our main dishes, I ordered us the Dry Sautéed String Beans, Kung Pao Chicken, and Squirrel Fish. The string beans were garlicky and flavorful, probably my favorite dish. The Kung Pao Chicken was a little spicy but delicious (and also had peanuts in it, so people with allergies be aware.)   And finally, the Squirrel Fish. I'm actually not entirely sure what it is on the menu, but in Chinese, it is called \"S?ng Sh Yú\" (\"song shoe you\").  It's a boneless WHOLE fish is fried, smothered in a sauce akin to the American sweet and sour sauce, and pieces are pulled off with chopsticks (or forks).   Overall, China Star is definitely recommended for someone looking for something a little different, those adventurous eater-types, or anyone who enjoys good, authentic Chinese cooking."}
{"text":"Lady who took our order completely memorized our order. I order something special and every time I go she remembers it. I've never had a probably and the place is really nice. I totally recommend going to China Star. If you go I recommend the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Great concept for Sichuan, but very poor execution. Like the vast majority of Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh and in the US,  they have fallen into the trap of serving greasy, highly sweetened food drowned in soy sauce base. If they just drop the greasy horrid common entrees like General Tso, moo goo gai pan, etc, then Chinese cuisine has a chance to be truly enjoyable outside the Chinatowns of SF, NYC, or LA. Their Peking Duck is close to one I savored in Beijing. The Green Tea Smoked Duck and Braised Rabbit are excellent. Hence, this  is a restaurant with great potential that could truly highlight the delicate tastes of China."}
{"text":"Total fan. Cute, clean little place. Not busy in the evenings at all - so the food comes quick. I stopped in for takeout and the woman who took my order was very nice. Ordered the General Tso's Chicken - was FANTASTIC and got a HUGE portion. The crab wontons were also delicious and extra crispy. I'm a fan. This is now my go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I love China Star! My food always arrives hot, I usually get delivery. I have done a pick up before also and the service is always great! They are my go-to when I order Chinese. I will continue to order from them of course!.   My favorites include Beef Lo-Mein, Chicken Fried Rice, Cashew Yok Ding (new fave!) and their egg rolls! The steamed dumplings are great too!"}
{"text":"I was at the shopping center and it was late so I decided to eat here. I asked the lady at the counter when entering what the total cost was. She pointed to the wall. but she didn't tell me that my drink was extra. The guy serving my table made it seem like my drink was included and refilled my drink. Anyway, upon leaving my checkout bill was at $12.00 which is laughable. I have no problem paying for what I owe. But this place is a cesspool of bacteria. The place needs to be cleaned. Also, the lady at the counter had no customer service skills and the guy who said his uncle owned the place was just as rude. So I wont be going here again. They need to close down and get the place cleaned. I don't expect a bargain place to be decorated like the strip hotels, but water goes a long way. Clean up the filth guys. A dinning room needs to be sanitary and the food need to be the right temperature. Ewww  bugs wouldn't eat here. It just seems that everything was out of cans. And loaded with salt and oil. The fruit didn't even seem fresh. Clean UP This Mess ! and be nice or get out of the service industry."}
{"text":"This one is not the one at Ross park mall, although they have the same name. This one only has American Chinese food. Don't expect more. But really cheap. We ordered four entrees and four soup, that's only about $25 plus tips."}
{"text":"Food prices are very competitive. Very large portions for lunch for under $6.  Everything comes out fresh and is delicious.  I really like the chicken chow mein. The soups are great, egg drop is my favorite. The food may be a bit on the saltier/greasier side, but then again I don't eat  McDonald's every day either for that reason. Overall, a very solid Chinese-American restaurant.  For people comparing it to PFChang, it's like comparing a local pizza joint to pizza hut, totally different experience."}
{"text":"Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.  I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway. Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of \"hot\" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad \"Mongolian BBQ\" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.   Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city."}
{"text":"One look in the men's room and it appears that everyone relieved themselves everywhere EXCEPT the toilets."}
{"text":"First the good:  the food is fairly  decent, especially for the price. They are quick to make your order.  You essentially get what you pay for.    I would give it a solid 3 or on a good day maybe 3.5 for food.  but service knocks it down to 1 star.  They used to have a younger girl/woman who worked the counter, seated you, and took your order, but she either left or they couldn't keep her.    Currently, the older woman who now works the register and seats folks is shrewish at best.  And it does not appear to be the result of any cultural divide or a desire to be \"efficient,\" as a previous reviewer suggested.  I have multiple times tried to engage her with a smile and make eye contact, but she--without fail--comes across apathetic and even angry.   Last 3 times, she drops food at our table without acknowledging us (today in such a hurry that today she swapped our drinks and our food--last time it was just the drinks).  She then turns without making eye contact.  I actually thought one or both of us had irritated her, but my buddy from work said she is always that way.  He would characterize her as rude as well.  I won't go back--if this is a cultural issue, they really need to bring the younger wait staff back.  I really do think it has to be impacting their business.  That's just not cool."}
{"text":"Excellent! If you're looking for a serious Sichuah/Chinese dinner, MAKE SURE you order from the \"real\" Chinese menu, not the Americanized menu. Best bets are the pickled vegetables in red oil, cold sesame noodles, tea smoked duck, mapo tofu, whole fish in spicy sauce, and eggplant with garlic sauce. Service was competent and friendly, atmosphere was pleasant and \"homey.\" Prices moderate/reasonable."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Pittsburgh that serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the \"fake\" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!"}
{"text":"I would just like to point out that there are two different China Star restaurants on Murray Ave.  The one across from the Giant Eagle is the good one.  They just opened a few month ago.  This is their second restaurant, so you know they're pretty good.  Their first restaurant's on McKnight Road in McIntyre Square.  I recommend reading a few of the review for their other restaurant if you want get an idea of what they're about.   The good China Star serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the \"fake\" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!  So, if you don't know which China Star to go to, pick this one.  It's just a few minutes away and the food is much MUCH better.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because the serves could have been better (not to say it was bad).  I've actually tried the other China Star too.  No authentic food there, but their \"fake\" Chinese food wasn't bad...it wasn't very good either.  It's kind of funny but I think the non-authentic Chinese food from the other China Star is better.  In short, if I feel like some good old general tso's, I'd rather go somewhere else.  I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars because the food is edible but nothing special at all."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Small selection of what I like to have amd overall just a gloomy environment."}
{"text":"This buffet has ok tasting food until one frightfull day when my friend and I went there for lunch and the entire place was being invaded by cockroaches the size of a Bull Mastiff.  The entry inside the restaurant was full of their dead bodies.  The inside was never very clean looking and I often questioned the looks of the kitchen.   Needless to say, I've never been back nor did my appetite get restored that day.  It made me wonder if I was a star on that show \"Bizzare Foods with Andrew Zimmern\".  God help me.  The staff was never very friendly or clean looking and the carpet was full of grease stains and if you weren't carefull, you would slip on the floor covered in grease.  So as soon as we discovered the millions of dead cockroaches, we made an about face and left.  We went to Applebees next door but I didn't end up eating lunch that day.  Everything on the menu looked like a cockroach to me.  China Star needs a serious overhaul to make that place up to snuff.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a rodent problem as well.  Very unclean."}
{"text":"The food is consistenly well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Thanks to a yelp review below I was able to order some traditional chinese dishes and the owner seemed to be impressed by that."}
{"text":"So this is a cheap fast Chinese buffet but you get what you pay for! !   Last couple of times I was on the toilet for days after I ate here never going again! !"}
{"text":"For the price, the food is fair. First time here and the guy server is really nice. Has such a pleasant demeanor. I didn't eat too much, but I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"Worst food ever... It was cold. The crab was verrrry small, fried. They did not even offer butter for it.  I don't recommend this place and will NEVER go back there!"}
{"text":"Me and my kids were looking for a new place to eat we were hungry and on the area... We decided to stop n try china star we honestly thought it was going to be bad we didn't have high expectations... We stopped by around 2pm we had the lunch special for $5.99 and for kids is like $3.75 or so... To be honest this place looked kinda old but the food is Fabulous!! Oh god we ate so much!!! We couldn't stop eating and our bill was only like $15 I was shocked!!! I left $5 tip and my bill was still like 20$ for good food! I'll come back again! Great place if you have a large family!!"}
{"text":"Well, this was my go-to Chinese restaurant up until today. I have ordered from China Star for several years, told people how great it was, always had great food and great service. What I dealt with today broke my heart. I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and they sent me some seafood soup concoction. When I had my fiance call to tell them that they sent the wrong order, they told him it was correct. I tried to eat this mess, got severely aggravated and called them again. The man on the phone stated that it was how the shrimp with lobster sauce was always made. He defended the incorrect meal that was sent to me. The dish has ALWAYS been delivered in a rectangle plastic container. What I got was the cylinder soup container. There was no \"sauce\" to be found in this container. Just a watery version of the dish I normally love. I told them what kind of customer I was, and they didn't care. Keep defending disappointing dishes like this, and you'll have nobody coming to your establishment."}
{"text":"I must be the only person to  have eaten in the restaurant. They served us water in Styrofoam cups and food in take out plastic dishes.  The food was not edible."}
{"text":"This place is simply disgusting!  The food was cold and the place smells like rotting fish."}
{"text":"takeout is fast! sat in to eat before and they were friendly, we ordered the lunch specials and it came with a can of pop. fast and cheap! you might have to ring the bell a few times to get noticed though :P"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend eating here. It's cheap and the service was okay, but the food wasn't that good and you might end up on the toilet for a while afterwards like I did. Steer clear of this place.."}
{"text":"Wow, what HAPPENED to this place?  Used to frequent it a lot.  Wife and I ate lunch there today for the first time in a long time. Impressions? -it's turned into a dump:  ceiling tiles are all spotted, carpet is dirty, no decorations on the walls (which need repainted).  Your average McDonald's has more ambiance than this place. -we were the only people in there eating at lunch hour -General Tso's sauce was bland, no flavor  China Star needs a MAJOR facelift.  Unless/until that happens, I will not return.  If you're in the area, you'd be better off going to Sesame Inn or Empire Szechuan.  Better yet, go to Lin's Garden on Route 8."}
{"text":"I will absolutely never eat there again! I did not get the full order that I made. The food is not fully cooked and could possibly be cause food poisoning. They are in no way accommodating and awful people. Never order from there."}
{"text":"I'm all for an all you can eat buffet for 8.99 lunch deals!  The decor was nice and the service was very courteous.  The food was pretty good too.  I was actually expecting not so good food, but they're bound to have at least a few good dishes that will fill me up hahaha.  The baked stuffed crab was bomb!  Fried chicken wings..... mmm... finger lick'n good!  The teriyaki chicken on a stick was scrumptious!!!!   So if you're on the strip and need a quick good bite for lunch, this will definitely fill you up & put you to sleep after hehehe  The only not so good thing is the rice.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant ever. Everything was bland and tasteless, the entire facility looked dirty and I won't even discuss the bathrooms lest the night terrors return. When I complained to a waiter that I had seen a cockroach near the food he shushed me and told me not to discuss such things. That was the last straw and I walked out of there with my family firmly in tow. Unfortunately I had already eaten some of the food and when I got home I spent 4 hours on the toilet. I will never return to this establishment and I am in fact going to call the health board in hopes of getting it shutdown."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special you get lots of food for a small price. Very nice staff. Little jem tucked away I wish more people knew about it. One of my favorite places to eat. Really recommend the spicy beef noodle soup my partner is chinese and she says it reminds her of the soup her dad used to make when she was little."}
{"text":"Terrible place. The food is simple, the price expensive, the place is dirty and employees careless. It is my opinion. Terrible lugar. LA comida es simple, caro, el lugar   sucio,  a Los empleados parece que no les interesa mucho dar mejor servicio. Es mi opinion."}
{"text":"We had our first experience here March 1st and were very pleased with the quality and flavor of the food.  The hot and sour soup was both spicy and sour, as it should be. We enjoyed the best pork egg foo yung we've had in a long time. Perhaps it was beginners' luck, but China Star is at the top of our list of Avon Lake Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here quite a few times. We used to go to the one on Charleston but that one looks a little too dirty in my opinion. This one on Craig is nice and clean compared to the one on Charleston. Lots of shrimp dishes"}
{"text":"Worse restaurant ever food was bad the waiters hardly ever showed and when I Went to the restroom an employee used the restroom and never bothered to wash his hands WOW.. Then went right back to work with FOOD! To make it worse i brought it up to the managers attention and  He said \"OK.\""}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I haven't had such a horrible buffett in my entire life!!!! Everything was old and hard!! And the sushi was worse then frozen sushi at Walmart. We all feel very ill now. I would never!!! Recommend this place to my worst enemy!!!"}
{"text":"The service was... terrible, and it's not because of the waiter. We ordered, among other things, 1/2 peking duck. It came with (only) 4 small pancakes to use as wrappers, sort of. It is not even close to enough to wrap the food. We asked for a couple more. Another waiter and the owner (probably) started badmouthing us in Chinese, which we understood, about how we ate too much, and a couple of other unpleasant things that I would not bother you with. The 2 pancake didnt cost that much (we know the street price for these, having had them many times before), and we dont mind paying for this (and we did pay) but trashing us behind our back while we were still there, assuming that we didnt understand, is just low. Me and my brother will NEVER visit this place again. Too bad the last time I visited, the male owner (her husband?) was very nice."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice,  tons of choices everything tasted fine, good price, recommend it."}
{"text":"I have ordered from China star numerous times and I never had an issue, but this last time was a nightmare! They sold me uncooked rice.... the rice was raw. Even the vegetables in the rice were raw and crunchy. Then when I called back, one of the employees told me to \"put it in the microwave.\" They refused to refund me! If you want to order food here, order at your own risk; I just wouldn't try the pork fried rice. :("}
{"text":".This spot is cool. We got seated quick. Food was good servers were good. Good clams. Good mussels. Good soft shell crab. Good ice cream. Good lemonade. Bathrooms could be cleaner"}
{"text":"Very impressed by this place great sushi and very tasty crawfish. They also have a good selection of food for the price I definitely will be back. I recommend this place it's a budget friendly buffet!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I give this place a star is because they had fried tilapia. This has to be the worst Chinese buffet ever. Not only was the food bland and not at correct temperatures (cold fries, really?!), there weren't any labels to let you know what you were looking at. MY GUESS IS AS GOOD AS YOURS game got real old, real quick. The presentation (i.e. personal rice cooker) gave me the impression they didn't even try. And the over all cleanliness was just plain pathetic. Their bathrooms are disgusting. How much rust are you really going to allow to sit there till it's taken care of? The trash in the woman's bathroom was well over filled and the stench was beginning to take on a life of it's own. The staff was.... present. I highly recommend this place to people who have never eaten at a good Chinese restaurant so that way they have no expectations and won't be disappointed. Everyone else, take my advise and look the other way."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas 30 years, and out of the many chinese restaurants in town,  this is absolutely the best.  There are many variety of dishes to choose from, the food is always fresh. On sundays it is very busy, but  the  staff  will  go the extra mile to find you a table, the most you will wait is 30 minutes in comparison to over an hour  elsewhere. The staff is consistent and always get to know the local  customers as well as  the tourists who arrive by bus. It is located in a locals area, but has attracted tourists as well. This place deserves 5 plus stars, excellent food and excellent service. I love it here and you will too.  Chris & Venera"}
{"text":"Went by reviews on Yelp and this place was not good at all.  The lunch special had no different price and two of the buffet table were empty!  Food was bland and not much variety!  Try something else before going here."}
{"text":"I go here about once every 2 weeks since I work in the area. The lunch specials are great and it is what you would expect from typical chinese food. The lady that is always at the cash register is really friendly. It's also a nice quiet place if you want to eat in, or about 10 mins for takeout.  Had to give the 5 stars because I finally found the BEST CRAB RANGOON (cheese wontons) so far in Pittsburgh. I have been looking for 6 years, and this is what one should look like/ taste like! YUM! If anything just go order them!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best looking places and the food was just OK. Crab rangoons were disgusting, I couldn't even eat them and the chicken and broccoli was weird tasting, the gravy was really thick and the rice wasn't the best i've ever had. It took five minutes to be greeted and to order my food. Will I go back, NO!"}
{"text":"I thought they were friendly and quick! The fried rice was delicious as was the hot n sour soup with some siracha, of course! I'll def go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just went to this buffet for the first time.  The food was cold and not very good.  The restaurant is dirty but I was really surprised when a roach on the table tried to hide under my straw.  My wife killed him.  I would have complained but no one ever came by the table in fact there were four tables inquiring about how to get the check so they could pay and leave.  This place definitely needs a visit by the health department and NO we won't be returning!"}
{"text":"This is so disgusting me and my parents went to go eat and my mom was going to start eating her shrimp. When she lift up the fork with shrimp on it she let out a little yelp and we all turned to see that there was a cockroach if I could I wouldn't even give a star but I need to give something to be able to comment here. So whatever you do don't go eat at China star."}
{"text":"We like this place.  It's not fancy or exotic, but it's pretty good food.  It's not the cheapest Chinese take-out, but it's far better than cheap Chinese at the food court.    Most recently, I had the garlic chicken with hot and sour soup. The soup was pretty strong, but quite good.  The entree was very tasty, though not quite as garlic-y as I might like.  So, probably about the right amount of garlic for most people.  We've never had a bad meal from there, though we've never had them deliver to us."}
{"text":"Descent buffet but really cheap price. If you lost all your money in the casinos and don't like the usual fast food joints, go here.  Dropped to 1 star because my mom went to restroom 3 times after the buffet."}
{"text":"Love the tan tan noodles, west lake beef soup, sauteed green beans. When I go here with other people, I usually get a shrimp and fish dish too because they are family style, though I love leftovers. My kids like it here too especially the dumplings and scallion pancakes. Make sure to order from the Chinese menu or from their specials board if you want something authentic. Some dishes are very spicy so make sure to tell them what level you would like. Service is slow but I'm a regular so I know not to be in a hurry when I visit."}
{"text":"Aus meiner Erfahrung heraus wußte ich ja das China Buffets in den USA immer gut und reichhaltig sindallerdings dies hier in Vegas kann ich auf keinen Fall empfehlendreckig, schlechte Auswahl und auch die Frische des Essens ließ zu wünschen übriglaßt es lieber auch wenn der niedrige Preis verlockend istdann lieber ein Buffet in den Casino-Hotels wählenz.b. MGM-Hotel, erstklassig wie auch wohl in den anderen Hotels"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service/food my family and myself have ever had! Took 1 1/2 hours for the food and called the place to complain offered a 10% discount. The food was old and cold the driver and manger very rude! Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly inedible - two dishes ordered one chicken one seafood.  Straight to the garbage can with both."}
{"text":"Wrong place to eat !!!!! Nasty food and dirty  place really need close this restaurant !!!!!!!!!!!!! NASTY FOOD !!! Bathroom dirty never. Back again"}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for Chinese takeout. The food always tasty and arrives well before the estimated delivery time.  The people are also awesome.  This past time, there was a mistake in the PayPal account charged. While it was not China Stars fault, the worker worked with us on the phone to right the situation. We have always ordered from this place because we like the food, but they have a made a lifetime customer with their service."}
{"text":"1.5x price than before after they move to Murray. It is still a mess there. Waiters seems don't have a clue yet. It might take time."}
{"text":"Our family has been here several times. It is a hit or miss. This past visit was okay. We ate dinner, cost is $9ish for adults, less for younger kids. Drinks are not included in the cost. Nice selection of food although staff is not very attentive at filling up trays of food that are practically empty. At one point, I had asked the server if a new tray of cake can be brought out because the existing tray was a mess with a few pieces of cake that were basically crumbs. The server was prompt in bringing the new tray and even alerted our table.  The staff needs to work on replacing empty trays, cleanliness and organization. I like the mussels, egg drop soup, jin dui, and shrimp with mushrooms. Selection on cold items are okay, like salad and fruit."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the area. It's a little further from home for me, but worth every minute of the drive. It's great that they deliver and their service is superior. I love their chicken and broccoli, and am eager to try more of their menu!   Update: Make sure to have small bills handy if ordering delivery. I had a bill for $13, gave him a $20 and wanted $3 back, and the delivery driver didn't have any change."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh food. The best egg foo yung I've ever had. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Strategically located in a walmart shopping center this place really lives up to its name. I give China star one star for food quality. But wait....I paid what for this?  In that case I'm getting what I paid for, this is how cheap food should look like so I might as well get my money's worth, and one serving of something that you like would put you there. Just like when you go to the Salvation Army  store, you just have to look around before you find something you like  and that is how I ended up with that sweet walnut shrimp that it was to die for. (not literally, I hope)    Although they have a decent selection most of the stuff looked like it had been sitting there for too long, life had been taken out of it  more than once, I could even guess they get all their sea food all the way from the Dead Sea and nothing was ever really alive.  There's nothing special about the decor of the place, just the basic booths tables and chairs to keep up with the theme of  cheap and tasteless. If nice and modern is what you looking for, Panda Express does it better ..but is more expensive of course.   At the end I think this place is ok. You get what you pay for and is a good alternative for when you're broke or want to take a date that you don't really want to see again. I have a feeling I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Very delicious!! Sooooooo tasty and the dish is so local in Taiwanese perspective. The cuisine is even better than the five star restaurant in Taiwan!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever my family and I visit Las Vegas we always have to stop at this Chinese buffet at least once during our stay. We highly enjoyed the food and the prices are reasonable. There is a variety of desserts and a variety of food entrées and sides. They have a lot of games out front for the children to play we have not use them though. Their different prices throughout the day there's lunch and dinner prices both are reasonable. The tables have always been clean you pay extra for drinks and the food places are refills as they go down. I've also use the bathrooms there rather clean. There is always plenty of parking out front and some handicap parking right up front. I would recommend this place to others as I do and I would recommend everyone to go for themselves. I know there are some low reviews but I think everybody has an opinion of their own. Go try it!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful either. The fruits and fresh foods could have been, well fresher i guess.   The issue i had with my experience was the bathrooms. I hate going into a restaurant with filthy restrooms because it makes me wonder what the rest of the rest of the place looks like. There was feces on the walls in the bathroom stalls of the women's restroom, overflowing wastebin and the supplies were not stocked, so obviously that means no one had been in there to tidy up in a while.   I am not sad to say I wont be going back, the staff was sort of lazy, and it took me twenty minutes to get a drink refill even though it wasn't particularly a busy time of the afternoon. I'm pretty sure my cheese wonton was rancid. Meh, I've experience better."}
{"text":"This place seems to be halfway through a name-change and was formerly Yen's Gourmet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/yens-gourmet-pittsburgh#hrid:jfHdFltRVZ3F82lYFiBZFQ).   This is cheap, neighborhood takeout at its best.  Lunches include an entree, rice, and soup or a soda, and most of them are under $5.  Most entrees are under $9 (except seafood entrees - the most expensive of which is $10.95).  The food is good and the restaurant is clean.  There is a big dining room with a cool circular doorway and the kind of typical Chinese knick-knacks you usually see, but it's fairly tastefully done.   As far as food goes, their vegetable fried rice includes more veggies than usual, and the sesame tofu is deliciously crispy.  It has 2 pieces of broccoli on the side, so you can pretend it's good for you.  The vegetable spring rolls are really tiny, but you get 2 for $1.50 so you can't really complain.  The hot & sour soup appears to have no beef - good news for vegetarians.  They also have some cool combination dinners where you get soup, a spring roll, a chicken wing, rice, an entree and a cookie for $10.50.  How this place makes any money is beyond me.  The only thing I haven't liked so far was the vegetables in yu-shang garlic sauce, but everything else has been good.  If you live in the neighborhood, definitely check out China Star.  You get a lot of bang for your buck, it's fast and it's never crowded."}
{"text":"Full disclosure. I actually come here all the time. BUT having said that, the food here sucks. ahahahha. I actually just come because it's close to work and convenient. Food is overall a C-. But it's insta-food. Interesting fact, there is not a single delicious dish here. I find this to be fascinating at a place that serves 30+ types of dishes. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Really like this place especially if your on a budget the selections decent and some of the dishes are better than others.  It's define try not bachanal but it's also 1/10 the price.  Did I mention this is cheaper than McDonald's and much more satisfying."}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice tasted rice a roni... ALL OF THE SHRIMP HAD SHIT IN THEM. NEVER GOING BACK. I would have given negative stars...but it's not an option."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered veggie fried rice.  Cashier took my $5 and gave me change.  He then proceeds to go to the kitchen and grab ingredients to cut up for the fried rice.  I yelled back to him that he shouldn't be touching food after handling money without washing his hands.  He walks back and washes his hands and then starts cutting the veggies.  I grabbed he change and told him to give me my $5 back.  He did and I left.  Kitchen full of other workers and nobody said anything.  The people in this establishment don't even have the basic common sense to keep their hands clean.  Avoid this place if you have any standards."}
{"text":"This place is great. Second time there on Tuesday night. Came in around 10:30 PM & they close at 11. $14.99 per person I believe & I think it was the manager in blue was SO nice. Gave us free drinks! The bus boy on the other hand was so rude. Threw the straws for our drinks on the table & went off. Never once did he crack a smile. The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away. Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt  for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !"}
{"text":"They continue to improve and impress me. The chicken in the lo mein was juicier this time and I can order online now at grubhub.com! They are short staffed though right now so keep that in mind when yelping about deliveries. I picked mine up and it was ready early. Super hot, steamy and flavorful! My order was exactly how I asked for it to be. I love how nice they are here and want them to stay in business!"}
{"text":"This is the only place my wife and I order Chinese from. We usually get some sort of fried rice, a combo meal, egg drop soup, and crab ragoon. We have never been disappointed and always have leftovers. We always order from Grubhub and our food arrives within 20 min every single time. You really can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Well priced, really good. My daughter and I love sharing the lo mein. The family meal packages are a great price with a nice selection to feed the whole family. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice little buffet. Quiet sit down restaurant with Chinese food. The Pros: very good food, lots of choices, and excellent service. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and friendly. Cons: not as clean as I would have liked it. I would definitely come back and do recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Pretty great while searching for a buffet. The food is stocked constantly. The Mongolian grill was a nice surprise and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is solid. It's your typical Americanized Chinese food, but they do a great job of it! My favorite is the homestyle tofu (I think on the menu it's called tofu with chinese vegetables or something). The chef even read my mind and asked if I would mind if I made the tofu spicy. The hot & sour soup is also good and they'll leave the pork out if you'd like it to be vegetarian.  Another thing that really stands out... this place is cheap. And you get a pile of good food for not very much money. It's perfect for a cold snowy night."}
{"text":"Food was ok but people eating there were rude! Two different families kept putting their empty plates & trash on our table!"}
{"text":"Ever drive past a dirt road a thousand times and wonder to yourself where does it go? Then one day...you say F'it and decide to answer the question? The is the restaurant equivalent of something like that.    My partner and I despite having brought our lunches, thought we would venture out.  Never in our wildest dreams thinking we would drive done this culinary road to finally answer the questions, or better yet MEET the CHALLENGE off a totally random, off road lunch adventure.  With our first, second, and third choices socked in with the middle of the week lunch crowd, we ended up in the parking lot of China Star.  After breaching the front door, we were received happily enough.  I immediately took in the rows of standard Chinese buffet fare that lay before me.  Looked tasty enough......cheap enough.  We were seated next to a real life looking equivalent of some Marvel comic super villain, as he devoured his plate.  Many a dead plate lay before him, slaughtered and empty.    While waiting for our drink order, it was then we decided to check-in on yelp and begin reading the reviews.  Some terrifying, others raving...it seemed the odds of not contracting an intestinal virus were in our favor.  With drink order made (Pepsi products) even though I ordered a Coke, we were off to see what awaited us.  Initially, all but a few trays were either full or half full. My first plate was full of coconut chicken, chicken skewers, General Tso chicken, Dynamite, Crab Rangoon, Lo Mein, and a few pizza slices thrown in for good measure.  While dining my partner and I constantly evaluated every entree and eventually settled on a solid Three Star Experience........This would eventually change.  Heading off for the second plate, I immediately noticed all but a few trays were totally empty.  I wandered around waiting and hoping they would be filled again soon.  But alas, this was not to be.  Every employee I locked eyes with attempting to plea for the trays refill, went ignored.  I picked through whatever I could find, resenting I was...as was everyone else......CUT OFF.  AFTER ONE PLATE!?  The partner and I thought this was absolutely a one star reduction.  All I can say, is what I did consume, I found tasty and it did not hold me hostage for the remainder of the day in the restroom.  I also felt a sense of satisfaction knowing what is at the end of the unknown road, I have passed a thousand times.  There is no need to go down it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today about 5:00pm for dinner. The selection was good, but the overall experience was disappointing. Most of the choices I made, were either barely warm or cold in temperature. Taste was ok at best. Service was good and the place was clean. Otherwise I would have give only 2 Stars. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for dinner take out.. we usually just get noodles and meat off the grill that they have (you pick they stir fry). We don't eat the other stuff they serve on the buffet because it's all nasty and when you think about everything there is nasty. If your restroom smells like bad urine (disgusting) and it's next to the kitchen you would think they can try and have it cleaned  or even spray air freshener maybe even crack the back door open But that just tells you they don't care. Slice mushrooms for the grill are not wash guaranteed if you go just look at it.. it never fails lol. I will never be going here again also due to the little lady that has a mouth piece I felt she was being really rude talking in her language something bout Togo box and 2 soup cups make sure they get soup I'm guessing lol they had the nerves to come to me and touch my Togo box I had already paid for and explained to me that the box needs to closed. No sh*t! This is not my first rodeo.. she seen me plenty of times I'm not no greedy b*#%h.  But in front of customers you want to make a scene and embarrass me with your loud fob talking.. FYI I don't tolerate bs I know how I am and how I get.. So I decided to get back my hard earned money and left. Something told me to calm down and walk out nicely (I was going to act a fool) lucky I did because as I was coming out police roll thru parking lot... I was really trying hard not to slap the s&@? out of her I can see the fear in her eyes she got me f@&ked up. Went to Buffet Asia paid a little more which was fine food was great and I had better choices fresh and clean worth my $20 all day! Oh And customer service was on point! Every staff there was happy and smiling.. best of luck to who ever likes china star thumbs down.. don't spend your hard earn money at this bs place and people who don't appreciate there customers and be littles a person.... spend your money wisely just please not here. We of all people should not support this business! If you have a few extra bucks is wise to spend it else where that appreciates your business! Customers makes a business successful but if it's not the business goal to strive and have professional  employees that treat customers respectfully than I don't know.. they shouldn't be in business anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered around 3pm on a Friday. Overall, I will not be visiting this place again, and can not recommend it.  Pros: The lady spoke excellent English and was very polite. It took about 20 min to finish the takeaway order, so fairly quickly. After I called about my messed up ordered, the lady was very quick to tell me I can get another item whenever I liked.  Cons: They messed up my order, even though it was marked correctly on the menu.  Food: 5/5 Crab Rangoon- very good, crispy, filling was very nice and flavorful 2/5 Teriyaki beef- good portion size, zero flavor, chewey 3/5 Egg drop soup- nice texture, no gooey chunks of egg, but very bland 2/5 Shrimp fried rice- good amount of shrimp, but oh so bland 2/5 general tso's chicken- good portion of very bland chicken. So so bland. ?/5 chicken lo mein- I don't know because I didn't receive this item."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food, not the worst.  The crab rangoon is phenomenal. What is notable is the sauce that comes with it. I think it is supposed to be duck sauce, but it has a sweet cherry-like flavor to it. It makes the sky open and the heavens sing.  Everything else is mediocre, really. Unfortunately, the specials seem to be hit or miss. Chow mein and egg foo young is meh, but the dragon special and general tso's is okay and good portioned.   I have never eaten inside the restaurant. The smell is slightly off-putting and I am usually in the mood for take-out. The decor is stereotypical Pan-Asian food joint.  Most people go here out of convenience and that the price is good. If you  can bare the hill walk up to Zaw's, I'd go there for my meal and pick up my crab rangoon on the way back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese take out always fresh and ready when they say it will be !! Love it"}
{"text":"Boyfriend was feeling Panda, but I'm trying not to go there, so we tried this place instead :)   For what you pay for, you can definitely eat your money's worth. Lunch ends at 4pm!!  It's a buffet so don't expect much service since everything is self serve. Plenty of seating and they have everything from fruits to dessert. The food overall was decent, there were plenty of protein to pick from, but not sure how often I'll be making my way back. I'd say it's a great alternative to Panda since you'll be paying the same price anyways."}
{"text":"Lots of variety. Large seating area. Reasonable lunch and dinner prices for a Chinese buffet. Run by an Indonesian family, so I was surprised that the food was mild flavored, as Southeast-Asian cuisine tends to be more spicy and strong flavored.  Food was good, although the crab legs was not very meaty or fresh looking. Employees were personable however. Located in a shopping mall, so they had ample parking."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and cold. It was cold because it took an hour and a half for it to come although they indicated it would arrive in 35 minutes. I will never order food from this place again."}
{"text":"The food is dirty, there is hair in the food inside, and then give some discount that nothing, we do not eat. Should let the Health Bureau come to check."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Compared to what I think are 4 star buffets like in North Las Vegas, like at Aliante casino, China Star doesn't quite have the variety or quality. China Star's lunch buffet, thoughis a decent value at $6.00 or so for adults. Dinner is $9. I'd rather go to a sit down place, and have less but better food and better service. But we deeiced to try this hugely popular place in North Vegas.  My nephews, who are half Samoan, love this place.  They are 10 and 14 but are built like they are 14 and 18 year olds and eat that way, too.  The older one LOVES one of their dinner-only entrees: the fresh water crawfish from the same muddy waters you'd find catfish. They're boiled, so simple and delicious.  It  takes a lot of them to make you full because only the tail of this mini lobster is typically eaten.  He piles them on his plate along with rice, fried chicken, and veggies (because his uncle (ME) says he needs too!).  But all that food and he's still hungry. Thankfully, it's all you can eat so  he just gets another plateful...just like everyone else here. I swear some people get three or four plates..  They have OK tasking siu mai, potstickers, and egg rolls, several types of veggies, and several chicken  dishes such as General Tso's, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, as well as boiled shrimp, various noodles, BBQ pork and beef with veggies and more. They have some egg drop and won ton soup which isn't so great. Even good soup gets blah if they sit too long. They have a lot of people going through the doors, so they continuously make small batches of the 30 something dishes. Dessert had some fresh fruit, almond cookies, fortune cookies, and jello.     There really isn't an atmosphere. - it's a buffet, after all The lighting is bright and the tables are close together.  There are people who remove plates as you go up to get another plateful, and fill your soda glass. I am stuffed when I leave here and my nephews are too, until they get home and watch TV and start in on popcorn."}
{"text":"Talk about bang for your buck. This place gives you so much food for seven bucks. Fried rice, egg roll, soup, and your main course. It lasts me for four meals. The main course has always been great, highly recommend the sesame chicken and beef with broccoli. However, I have got to say, the fried nice is NOT the best, but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"It was closed for a bit but they've been open again for quite a while now. And yes I understand it's not the best food, but for 6.99 it's an amazing deal! There are some certain foods that are good !  I've been there like 4 times now and I like it. Of course they should make some improvements, but none the less, it's all good with me."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed the food here.  The General Tso is delicious.   The food came quickly and the service was great!"}
{"text":"This place went from good to gross! From friendly waiters to rude bitches.. Today I went trying to have a chill meal when the waitress kept bugging me over the littlest thing.  I just wanted to eat peacefully without you hovering over me. Geez! Then she talks her shit cause i didnt tip her. No shit. I'd tip her if she left me the fuck alone. And as i walk out.. guess what i found? A rat! Runs to the parking lot and chills there.."}
{"text":"The $6.49 linch lured is in...The chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was bad. As in not good for human consumption at this point. The coconut chicken although cheaper than the usual coconut shrimp was yummy. Fried rice was good. Egg rolls were beyond horrible & no duck sauce. Service was poor since we never got a refill until after we got our check and still had to ask for it. Nothing remarkable beyond the price."}
{"text":"A note to the people who gave this place 4 or 5 stars. Have you ever been to a restaurant before? Was this the first time you ever eaten food?   This place is bad from top to bottom. The food is not good, and the dining room area smells terrible. There are no signs that can be seen from the north, so anyone coming from 90 would miss it completely."}
{"text":"This place is great if you know what to order. I wouldn't say that they are 100% authentic, but there are enough to satisfy most Chinese."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You get good bang for your buck. I like the build it your self bar in the back. Good place to eat if your on a carb diet. Lots of meat and vegetables. It may smell funky in the back area but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood Chinese buffet. Lunch is just over $6, dinner is just under $10. If you don't like the options here, Jumbo Buffet is just around the corner. If you really want seafood, shell out the extra $3 and drive another mile up to Buffet At Asia.  Standard Chinese options, four soups, limited sushi selection, and Mongolian grill available- several shrimp and crab dishes during dinner hours. Service actually exists here and will clear your table and refresh your drinks frequently. Hits the spot when you're craving takeout Chinese but can't decide what to order."}
{"text":"Having lived all over the us, I have been to many crappy Chinese buffets. I did read the review on this one and thought it was worth a try... Mistake I made...lunch buffet was 13.00 for the worse quality food known to man. For the first time in my life I am worried about getting sick... Stay away..."}
{"text":"Fucken nasty food don't ever eat here   Shitty smells like shit  rude manager   Don't come here  trust me"}
{"text":"I thought because the price was $8.99, we were going to get what we paid for... was I wrong. The food was absolutely delicious! Our waitress was extremely courteous. It was a bit crowded and the crab went pretty fast....had to wait on certain food items but it was worth it. If you go here... try the fried crab and spicy shrimp. I would've gave them a five star review but the cashier wasn't very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is one of my top places to go whether I'm feeling down or just want a good bite to eat. The staff is great the lunch prices are amazing for what you get. Don't come here expecting the cheap stereotypical Chinese chain restaurant food not going to be that price what is going to be all that much better. My favorite dish here is the sesame chicken it isn't heavily breaded like a lot of other places in the sauce isn't thick as molasses. But back to lunch, you can get a decent amount of food often times will bring out a small cup of soup with those little crispy noodle things, then with your main dish you get a generous helping of fried rice along with your entree and an egg roll. If you like spicy things be sure and ask for the hot mustard I'm not sure if they switched to using packets or if they still have their house made hot mustard but it's really good with egg rolls. So after all that your total comes to under or around $10. This is the best Chinese place in Madison hands down, I've actually used it as my basis of judging every other place I've eaten and hardly anything comes close."}
{"text":"Low-priced chinese buffet - I definitely like this place better than Jane V. (the previous reviewer). I think the food is very good. Restaurant not dirty at all, though it is on Charleston - not the greatest area, but not terrible either. The shrimp in coconut sauce is my fave and all the other selections are tasty and filling. Good barbecued pork and a sushi bar (which I am not personally into); no complaints about the food, but sometimes the patrons are a bit seedy... still a solid buffet - I recommend it!"}
{"text":"3.5, but rounding up!  Pros: - They know how to make healthy fare... aka steamed chicken and veggies w/ brown rice! (who knew you could steam chicken???) - Crab wontons w/ cheese - Friendly staff  Cons: - The chow mein tasted like soy sauce, straight up - Restaurant was empty... I'd probably never stop in to eat. It's more of a takeout/delivery joint."}
{"text":"I've been to this place before the service is usually good and the food is usually fresh and good, but today the food was cold and service was bad. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"One star doesn't do this place justice. They deserve less.  We ordered a delivery of food for dinner. Upon opening the fried rice that we ordered we discovered that a bug had gotten into the food. It appeared to have been fried along with the rice. Needless to say we were displeased. We called them back and asked them to come pick up the food as we weren't going to eat it, and to bring back a reciept for the credit card cancellation of the order.  Half an hour later a man with a flashlight showed up at our door. We gave him the food back, as we'd packed it back in the bag. He proceeded to unpack the food on our patio and start digging through the fried rice with the flashlight to look for the bug. Then he started going through the rest of the food - on our patio. Making a mess with BBQ rib sauce... when asked to leave he started arguing with us. We had to threaten to call the police before he would leave the porch.  When we called and asked to speak to the manager, we were told that the man with the flashlight who had been on our porch WAS the manager.  Needless to say, I am never ordering from there again. Completely inappropriate behavior from them.  Zero stars if I could give it."}
{"text":"Why do I even eat this stuff anymore, is what I asked myself after eating take out from this place today. I mean as far as Chinese food goes, China Star is as good as any other Chinese food joint. But it's crazy fuckin unhealthy food when you right down to the brass tacks of it. You can actually feel it killing you as you ingest it. I think I continue to eat it because, if I am to be truthful, I want to die and so I am just choosing to commit suicide slowly by General Tso's chicken and wonton soup because I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself with a gun or by hanging myself. This past winter I drove out to the woods and I had a bottle with me and I walked deep into the woods and I drank until I blacked out and I made sure I had taken my coat of and thrown it in the creek and my hope was that I'd pass out and get hypothermia or just freeze like jack Nicholson in the shining but I ended up in my black out just making my way back to my car and passing out with the engine running and the heat on and when I woke up I felt embarrassed and ashamed of myself. So now just for extra measure I put ten packets of soy sauce all over the pork fried rice and six packets of duck sauce on my egg roll. I don't know what's in soy sauce or duck sauce but I know the more I eat of the stuff the sooner I'll die. And that makes me want to eat it more and more because I just want to hurry up and die already and I'm too much of pussy to do it any other way. This world is so terrible and life is so pointless and everyone I've ever cared about has either left me or died so that I too now just want to join them. I'd leave myself if I could but that has proven impossible. Believe me, I've tried to with cocaine and gay sex and heroin and bad art and music and I even became a born again Christian but they kicked me out because the pastor of the church was a closet fag and wanted me and so one day a couple of guys from the choir caught me and him fucking in the the confessional and kicked me out. I'm so tired of myself. I'm so tired of everything. And I hate all of it. This whole god-damn terrible world, I just hope everyone and everything drowns in HIV infested semen. Every night I retire to miserable and sad dreams. Dreams I wake up crying and feeling utterly desperate and shocked and alone from. Not even sleep provides me a reprieve. I dream of my dear mother, how she died so young and how beautiful she was and how she wanted me to come see her in the hospital but I couldn't and so she died alone. I dream of her telling me that I was a horrible son and that after I die I'm going to burn in hell. But I know it's just my poisoned brain manifesting my mother to say those things in my dreams because I'm sick and I hate myself and I know my poor mom loved me, maybe the only one, and she'd love me even through the most horrible parts of my life and he fact I wasn't there when she left and was alone in that cold room in that hospital kills me every night. And now there is just me. And, yes, there was someone else, once, a long time ago, who might've cared for me, and I really did care for them too. But I pushed them away. And then I heard they'd committed suicide years later. If my heart wasn't utterly unrepairable, and I was healthy again, I wouldn't touch Chinese food. As it stands, unfortunately, this is how my life's turned out. Life, with all its abundant early promises, has become nothing but an arduous vomit soaked chore. And so I eat Chinese food. And as Chinese food goes, china star serves up the crap as good as any of the others. I used to live in New York City. The Chinese food there was a lasting high water mark to compare all other Chinese food to but there, the restaurants serve the real stuff, not just this crazy indistinguishable breaded meat with this crazy artery corrosive red sauce caked all over it and everything crammed with so much sodium that minutes after the first bite you can feel salt crystals forming and clogging all your pores. As for me, let death come. Let me feel the Chinese food slowly suffocating my body's ability to live. Let every cell in my body drown in MSG. Let me have my death by Chinese food. I recommend the sweet and sour Pork!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but the prices are cheap and delivery isn't the worst (it was under an hour for 3 miles away and friendly service). I had the Szechuan and Kung Pao, and both dishes were identical (battered fried chicken in a sesame-like sauce, the sesame had sesame seeds on top). The egg rolls are huge and you get soup with every entree, and the food was on par with Panda Express with more generous portion sizes, so I'm a fan."}
{"text":"It's a heartwarming family restaurant with quick service, hole-in-the-wall interiors and eager owners.  Unfortunately, while the setting is endearing in a \"Les Miserables\" sort of fashion, I'm not sure the food is up to snuff.  This is Americanized chinese food, without any of the fanfare of Panda Express or PF Chang's.  Indiscriminate \"brown sauce\" reigns supreme here, and covers many different meats and vegetables.    I'm strongly biased against this kind of food, so please read this review with that bias.  It's not particularly bad for this class of food though it is a bit salty for my tastes.  Mediocre for carry out Americanized C-food."}
{"text":"This Sichuan restaurant is hidden away in the McIntyre mall on McKnight road. They indeed have authentic Chinese food, similiar to what How Lee and Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill has to offer. However, when we went they were extremely short on staffing, thus the service was super slow. As long as you have the patience, this place is worth trying. But if you already live in the Squirrel Hill area, I would not make a trip all the way out here just for the food. However, they do offer hot pot, which I am not sure if How Lee or Sichuan Gourmet offers. But if you go during times they're short on staffing, do not expect to be served with hotpot anytime soon. I forgot exactly what we ordered, but they had a spicy hot pot casserole with all kinds of mushrooms that was pretty good. And I also enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles as well. Overall, yes it's a good restaurant that's worth trying and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the first and most definitely the last time we are ordering from this place. We ordered from grubhub so we thought that our order would be pretty clear. We both got the general tso's combo meal that was supposed to come with your choice of rice and soup. After an exceedingly long amount of time (close to an hour and a half) we got our food and low and behold they got our order wrong! No soup. Just subpar, overly-greasy egg rolls with one measly piece of shrimp! Where the heck is my wonton soup?! Awfully ticked...."}
{"text":"China Star is what it is, as far as traditional \"American\" chinese goes.  We've been twice now and both times we've been more than pleased.  Food: Both times the same.., egg rolls, wonton soup, pork Lo Mein, shrimp egg foo young.  It is all delicious (which is why we duplicated).  Staff: Not friendly, no smiles, all business  Appeal: Basic and simple.  Not dirty but, not spotless either... We prefer take out"}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad, this little Chinese restaurant next to the Johnson Bank building does the trick if you want some average Chinese food for a good price. Also, I have to admit that I was surprised at how OK their sushi was -- I was definitely expecting to die from it, but actually sort of enjoyed it (don't make fun of me for admitting to that).  There are coupons printed right in the menu for free stuff depending on the cost of your bill, so the wife and I were able to get free spring rolls with our meal."}
{"text":"Lots of seafood, for the seafood lovers. Other than that terribly bland and just cheaply made food. Seemed like they put no effort and no spice to the food."}
{"text":"this rating is based on an $8 lunch buffet, just what you'd expect and was happy stopped by"}
{"text":"Good basic Asian style cuisine, close to my house and they deliver...what more could I ask?"}
{"text":"Good food, cheapest and the staff was really polite and gave us a lot attention. I recommend it if you aren't critical food."}
{"text":"This was the WORST Chinese food I've ever had in my life!!! Greasy- terrible quality- disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap hole in the wall Chinese buffet that I visit about one a month because it's near my office. For the price, you really can't beat it - $6.50 for lunch and about 9 bucks for dinner. Same foods you'd find at any other Chinese buffet plus a ton more suspicious characters...Probably attributed to the super low price! Sometimes you'll see people that look like hobos and other times you'll see large tour groups here being dropped off by a coach bus. So hey, the food couldn't be too bad right?  I usually get the same few things here - chicken wings, BBQ pork, bourbon chicken, roasted chicken and wonton soup. All decent quality especially when taking the sub $7 lunch price into account!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a affordable small buffet. Consistently busy and staff run around with their heads cut off, so don't rely on them much. But for the price and mainly good food, it's a great place to stop by for lunch with the family. Kids like the selection, and I like the price :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I moved to Vegas, around 6 years already. They have good food, all you can eat for a good price. When you go often you know what's the best time to get there, when they have fresh food. I love that some of the servers they already know what you drink. And they are capable to remember your face."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my shrimp with broccoli.  It was bland which is odd for Chinese food. Also, the waitress did not know if they had unsweetened iced tea and did not want to check to see if they did."}
{"text":"The food tends to be overly greasy but we have been faithful to our local Chinese restaurant because they deliver, are fast and well priced  - but tonight we have placed our last order.   They forgot to include a few sauces and noodles, no big deal, but when we called to request what was missing the women was uncooperative and would not acknowledge the missing items and ultimately we never received our full order even after she finally agreed to bring  them.   Everyone makes mistakes but when you don't make corrections and then treat the customer like an annoyance and your food is only so-so, it's time to find a new Chinese Restaurant.  Goodbye China Star!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. It's one of the better buffets I've been to! Four of us went and our total bill was $55, so it wasn't too bad of a price."}
{"text":"Small.  Family-owned.  At lunch you'll be greeted by Angela (4 years old and still learning English).  The food is not gourmet, but it's good, honest Chinese food. Lunch specials are a bargain, and the giant bowls of soup are five bucks.  I wouldn't eat the fried appetizers too much, but I think they're pretty bad at any Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. I wouldn't say it's gross, but I wouldn't say it's high quality either. It's satisfying nonetheless. I enjoyed the Beijing beef, cream cheese wontons, egg drop soup, sweet rolls, spring rolls and their tapioca pudding. The price was fair and of course as a buffet you're bound to eat until you can't eat anymore. Service was great!! Don't set high expectations, but you can enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Sichuan food?   This is your place in Pittsburgh.  I'm wondering how soon is too soon to go back.  There are two menus.  One has Americanized Chinese food like cashew chicken.  Do yourself a favor and just look at the other menu -- the one in Chinese with subtitles.    Some of the dishes we tried -- Appetizers:   Won tons in red oil (just ok),  Tan tan noodles (a must get...lo mein noodles in spicy sauce) Scallion pancake - ok, a little greasy but not bad.  Entrees: Salt 'n Pepper Shrimp - I thought they were great.  A little under seasoned. Twice cooked pork belly with leeks - Outstanding Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce - If you like eggplant, it's great. Sichuan fried green beans - Perfectly cooked and very tasty.  The service was friendly and prompt and they were willing to accomodate our requests (e.g. peeling the shrimp before cooking).  The prices were reasonable, and I can't wait to go back.  p.s. - you can also allegedly bring your own wine and pay a small corkage fee."}
{"text":"If you're the Sesame Chicken and Crab Rangoon type, I can't speak to that.  Stop reading.  If you're looking for 'authentic' Sichuan cuisine (as far as this white guy knows, but my Chinese friends agree), this is your place.  Appetizer:  Tan tan noodles.  Best in Pittsburgh, and head and shoulders over New How Lee.  The noodles were just right, the sauce had a kick, we could have eaten bowl after bowl.  Entrees:  Double cooked sauteed sliced pork belly with leeks -- very good.  Could have used a bit more oil and the portion wasn't overly generous, but we'll get it again.  Chonqing (dry fried) chicken was the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  Where How Lee's was covered in oil, China Star's was spot on.    That's all I've tried so far, hopefully the review will be updated soon with more.    THAT SAID...The prices do seem higher (?) than the McIntyre Square location, and you do need to deal with the Squirrel Hill parking scene.  We were also there on a Sunday afternoon, so I can't speak to how the service is when they're busy.  For us, it was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"Despite apprehensions of the 1st review here I decided to try this place for somewhere different after talking to a Co-Worker about this place.   Upon entering, the atmosphere was nothing like the China Star on Maryland and not very inviting at all. I cant put a finger on it exactly and am in no mood to disect it at this time.  As usual, I arrived around 3pm still making it for lunch. The kitchen is visible through open glass & while I didnt inspect it or pay much attention to it, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. However, when I went to get some sushi, which is adjacent to the kitchen, the girl making it was giving me this look. I just looked back at her and said \"DAMAGE INCORPORATED\" taking a big plate of rolls. The \"seafood salad\" that I accompay my sushi with looked like it was opened from its container and placed in the bowl = no mayo and no attempt at all to cut it up or add ingredients to it. In hindsight THIS sets off some alarm bells for me.  The sushi was nothing special and the wasabi had a soup-like consistency to it. In addition to this, they offer your normal chinese fare and the stand out was the Coconut Chicken which instead of being all batter was \"all chicken\" in a light to medium batter and very good. The spicy chicken was just plain weird = orange, dry & not spicey at all. Everything else seemed normal and standard.   As far as the service goes, they seemed freindly enough & I realize I get to these places when the help is having thier lunch and they have to eat too, but I still had to get up and ask for a water refill and that is NBD to me at all under the circumstances.  Overall it was what it is for the &6.50 price & that would have been the end of it and I wish it was. I would have done this review ending it here saying: \"It was ok but I wont go out of my way to return there as there are way better places as far as quality and more offerings like shrimp etc. for the same price\" and given it  2 stars.  But THAT wasnt the end of it as something followed me home and \"sat\" on my stomach giving me a queezy feeling all night. Then in the morning I woke with a fever and not feeling good at all and after trying to swallow a sip of my morning coffee began to puke my guts out. I was GLAD to get whatever it was that was making me sick out of my body!! I barely made it into work and the whole day I was lethargic and C0-workers could tell I was under the weather and not my normal self (which they all probably enjoyed!! LOL). I didnt eat anything until late in the day & it was a small yogurt and forced at that.  My guess is that somewhere along the line, as presented with the seafood salad, someone cut corners and compromised some raw food or something. All I can say is based on my own experience is \"BEWARE eating at this place\". I'm writing this 2 days after the fact & I still have no appitite due to the above outlined experience.  If anything positive I can take away from this and pass on to the reader is:   STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW & DONT BE SO ADVENTUROUS!!\" uhhhhh ............word to the wise"}
{"text":"When I first arrived we were seated pretty quickly and our drinks came right away the place wasn't busy we came around 3pm the atmosphere was ok mind the girl that was in front of us with her ass cheeks  out.  The Buffett line didn't have that much Chinese food out it wasn't a variety of Chinese food to choose from the fried rice was dry they needed to refill it  the white rice was gummy the salmon didn't look so appetizing.  I tried to coconut chicken and the teriyaki chicken it was very mediocre. Honestly me and my boyfriend could of went to Panda Expresss. Would I come here again probably not. I think Buffet Asia is way better."}
{"text":"I recommend the peppery chicken or the sweet n sour pork.  The hot n sour soup is amazing as well.  Friendly staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"There was a lot of food, but it was absolutely rancid. The environment was hideous not to mention the \"clean\" dishes still had food on them! The servers hardly spoke English and where very rude. I wouldn't suggest this to my worst enemy. You're better off eating at the Burger King right next door."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food! Mapo Tofu is fantastic with spicy flower peppercorn. Lots of great dishes from the Chinese menu. Ask the owner to suggest a few dishes! They deliver also if you live near by. :)"}
{"text":"Went here the other day. Literally the most disgusting place I've ever been. Food is cold and gross. I've been to way better places then this. The restrooms very very smelly. Seriously could not even eat my first plate. Never coming here again. You guys seriously need a change in management!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the reopening of this place because I have had some good food from here. I stopped to eat lunch and ordered General Tso's Chicken (my usual, as my family says). It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I remember it being better prior to the reopening. So, 3 stars is my rating because I hope it will get better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever. Love the soups. Love the hot pots. The spice is like no other spice i have ever had."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. They told us the food would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived there in about 20 minutes to which I was told it would be ready in couple minutes. 10 minutes later I ask about how long and am told a couple more minutes. 20 minutes later the same thing. Finally 10 minutes after that I said I wanted a refund if it wasn't finished. Our food comes out at that point. We leave and get home to find half of our food is missing. What we did have was completely cold. When my fiancé and I called them to express my displeasure the woman on the phone said its not her problem and hung up on me. When I called back and demanded a manager we were hung up on again. Will be filing dispute with bank tomorrow."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month, price 10.99 ok, food always tastes fresh , lots of variety, 4-5 diff kinds of shrimp, dumplings and crab rangoon are awesome, service was good, people are friendly too."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times. My parents love this place the food is always fresh. I like it what i dont like is that sometimes their customer service sucks. I feel like the are always rushing you to eat and leave they always bring our check right when we are in the middle of having our meal. To me thats just plain rude yes im gonna pay but please let me finish eating! Other than that i like this place is economic and the food is good."}
{"text":"This is your best choice for authentic Sichuan cuisine.  The Chinese delegation for the G20 had all their food catered from the China Star, and that's because this restaurant is the real deal.    Be advised that there are 3 menus, so try to get the most authentic Chinese menu.  You are best going with someone who is knowledgeable about Sichuan food your first time there.  I highly recommend the Tan Tan Noodles, it's a traditional dish and a great way to start your meal.   I also enjoy the Flaming Pan Chicken.  The decor is not fancy...but the draw is the fabulous food."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had!!! Never again will I order from this place tried to place an order the guy was extremely rude & very unprofessional honestly he seemed racist & he hung up on me I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is pretty okay. The food is good. Nothing out of the ordinary. I did notice that it's an old place. I read reviews about the cleanliness and I agree with it to an extent. The place just needs to be remodeled with a deep clean tbh. The gentleman that gave us our table was rude but the wait staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"China Star is a solid choice for take-out Chinese food (which is all that I have done about 8-10  times so far). I am not a Chinese food \"snob\" but I am choosey when it comes to the dish I like which is General Tso's chicken.  Theirs is very tasty, has a nice kick (though I do order extra spicy as a preference) and it comes with white rice. Their lunch price is $5.25 and it is a generous serving for a lunch size.  The chicken is good quality (I have not noticed any bad pieces like some restaurants use)."}
{"text":"What a great secret this place is. Tucked away in McIntyre square you would never expect it to be a bastion of authentic Chinese dishes!   When you walk in the door, you're met with very typical Chinese Restaurant style decor. But then you notice that the whiteboard menu over the entry way counter is all in Chinese. You look around and the place is filled with Chinese. The auspices are good. There are two menus: one that is more focused at the American palate and one that is pretty much as authentic as you can get.  Having been to China, and having pined for the food since I left, I always order off the second menu.   My favorite appetizer is the tripe and tongue. It's tender and delicious and you can totally forget what you're eating.   Entree wise I have had their special fish in chili sauce which was serviced beautifully whole and was sublime. I have also had their Dragon Tongue Duck (not sure about that name....I couldn't really understand the gentleman's accent completely.) It was duck in a spicy sauce with vegetables and    . I also have had and highly recommend their cumin flavored beef and lamb.  Both are incredibly good.   The owner will come to your table if you order something out of the ordinary for Americans and make sure you know what you're getting. I just wish that he wouldn't act so surprised that Americans would be willing to venture outside of the strict General Tsos chicken arena. Still, who can blame him. Not many of us will. If you're one who wants to, go to the China Star and make sure they give you BOTH menus. It'll be a great experience!"}
{"text":"I dont know how places like this stay in business???? It was awful!!!! I mean how can you mess up brocolli? It was like they opened up a jar of brown gravy and poured it over top. Gross!!! I will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were travelling late through town last night on our way to Minneapolis. My friend ordered dumplings and paid nearly $10. When the order arrived, they were extremely greasy, burned, and looked like and tasted nothing like pork!  (The meat inside the dumplings was extremely dark and looked more like cooked, burnt beef!)  They looked NOTHING like the little picture on the counter.  The manager there refused to cooperate by providing any substitution, even though they were minutes away from closing.  She was extremely rude and condescending.    The little restaurant was also very dirty and cheap-looking.  Needless to say, we will never step foot in there again and advise anyone else to avoid it as well."}
{"text":"As others described this place, standard and reliable.  Ordered with coworkers for dinner tonight and was satisfied and underwhelmed all in one, if that's possible.    For the satisfied part, I was surprised by the amount of food I received.  I order the General Tso's (old reliable) combination plate.  Unlike other places when you order and combo plate you get soup and an egg roll on top of the entree.  To me, soup from a Chinese restaurant is nothing more than a tea with food in it.  The egg roll was surprisingly good.  I think they may have mistakenly gave me a shrimp egg roll instead of the run of the mill regular egg roll (not complaining there).  As for the entree, their \"small portion\" was that of any other place; read - not small.  As for the underwhelming aspect of the food, the fried rice may have been fried a bit too much.  Some of the chicken pieces were a bit dry.  For being General Tso's, it wasn't nearly spicy enough for me.    In a pinch, this place sure can fill the void when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"My son and I came here looking for a local Chinese food spot. The place was clean, but the food was horrible. Tasteless, and what kind of Chinese buffet serves pizza? Very disatisfied"}
{"text":"Man this place gets some pretty harsh reviews! I lived in North Las Vegas from 08-12 and, during that time, would enjoy China Star from time to time. Earlier today we decided to have it just for old times sake.  So here is my take of China Star and why I feel it is worthy of a 3 star review..  (+) Lunch Special was $7.99 per person/all you can eat buffet. Seriously, what can you reasonably expect? Two of us had a buffet each with 1 soft dink and 1 water and the total bill came to less than $20. Good Luck finding that at a lot of other places! (+) Plentiful selection of food! Today I enjoyed pot stickers, fried rice, orange chicken, pepper steak, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, among other things! I can say I easily got my $7.99 worth. (+) Service here was actually pretty good. We were seated promptly and hooked up with drinks while we loaded our first plates. Refills were handled in a timely fashion and while settling the bill the gentlemen who took my card was friendly and joking around. All good. :)  (+/-) Food quality varies by the dish. Some were a little cold, some were a little dry. If you can catch a desired dish just as they are switching the pans out, that is the ideal time to get your ass back there and load up! lol Teriyaki Chicken was juicy and tender and easily my favorite item from the meal. Pot Stickers were tasty but a little cold.I could go on, but basically it is a hit or miss situation.  (-) No peanut butter chicken! Boo! Back in the day that was my favorite dish here. I don't know if I caught them on  day they didn't prepare it or if its off the menu completely but that stuff was freakin' awesome! (-) avoid the bathrooms if you can help it. Nuff said.  All that being said, it would be crazy to 5 star this place. Even 4 stars is coming on a bit strong. But I would definitely come back here again! For the price point, you definitely get your moneys worth!  This place is A-Ok with me!  3 stars."}
{"text":"Updating my review here a little bit.  I stopped in here for lunch because I was working at our North Hills office.  And I can safely say that China Star is still a great little place.  And their $5.95 lunch special still can't be beat.  I tried their garlic beef and hoo-boy!  Strong!  Almost cleared my sinuses.  But o-so good."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Elyria not too long ago, and noticed China Star was the closest Chinese restaurant to us. We found their menu online and placed an order. Everything went okay. But after we got the food, the first thing we noticed was the portions; I ordered chicken on a stick, and BOY was it small, tiny pieces on a stick. The fried rice that came with it wasn't a whole lot. My wife on the other hand got Sweet N Sour chicken and her portion was far more than mine. We both ordered the dinner combination consisting of the entree with fried rice and an eggroll. So naturally, we expected at the very least to have the same amount of rice. Not even close. Either way, I decided to at least try to enjoy the food. The chicken looked like they took a blowtorch to it. It was beyond burnt to a crisp. The rice was okay. It tasted like normal rice, but again a small quantity compared to my wife's. Then the eggroll...Eck. It tasted like they had just put it through water. In other words, it had a disgusting aftertaste. Honestly made me want to bleach my mouth. I took one bite and that was it. My wife noticed and didn't bother having hers.   Definitley not worth the money, and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't expect Strip quality/style buffet. This is a local spot for locals.  This place is a favorite buffet for my parents who look for local and less expensive than the casinos nearby.  Service is good as expected when they serve a packed house. The food is decent and flavorful. It really reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall type Chinese restaurant with really discounted lunch specials.  On this occasion, I stuck with the fried shrimp, mussels, and their version of sushi. Again, discounted Chinese food in a buffet style.   No frills. Nothing special. Nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Normal, what-you'd-expect for Chinese takeout. My roommate & I always order from here. You get a lot of food for cheap. Egg rolls are delicious! Fried rice is mediocre but the rest of the food makes up for it.   Sesame chicken is delicious. General Tsos was spicier than expected.  If you want cheap & quick take out--I would definitely recommend China Star!"}
{"text":"surprising delicious and generous entrees. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have ordered China Star countless times and every order was on point,  fast, and delicious!  Especially their general tsos and chicken with garlic sauce with a nice side of crab wontons and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"The food is fast, the service is good, and the price is right. The General Tso's chicken was bit over done and lacking veggies. It will serve work in a pinch, but my open additions for a local Chinese takeout place will continue."}
{"text":"This place is a cut above your usual Chinese takeout.  The chicken seems like real chicken -- not that too-soft variety you've probably had before.  Most of the dishes we've had have been decent to pretty good.  One plus is that they have Szechuan Cold Noodles, which don't seem to be available at many restaurants in the Cleveland area -- and they're really tasty too.  Very friendly husband and wife, who own the place and work all hours."}
{"text":"Horrible my sister found a cockroach in her drink and they didn't give her it free they let her pay it all"}
{"text":"Oh, man, did I ever order from the wrong China Star! I should have read Meghan C's review first, for the correct location, but the food is also uninspired and mediocre at best.   I call in a delivery order, and she tells me that it's an hour for delivery. Could I pick up? Yeah, sure, whatever. I place my order, and then she calls back to say they have no duck, and that I need to pick another entree. OK... After I drive to the wrong (an bustling) China Star in Squirrel Hill, I make my way to the correct (and completely empty) China Star in Greenfield. Boy, this food sure is disgusting.   Hot and sour soup: inedible; vegetable spring rolls: stone cold, pale, and inedible; Double delight: chicken was stone cold, and the white sauce was a gloppy mess. The menu is already in the recycling, and maybe I'll try the other China Star next time."}
{"text":"Just awful. We gave this place another chance. It's gross. The entry is full of dirty walls, cobwebs, filth, the interior looks like a prison . Everything we ordered was gross. The won ton soup is dark brown with hard thick tasteless dumplings .  This place should close down. Only one other table of customers on a Saturday night   You'd have to have low low standards to appreciate this dive"}
{"text":"Price was $11 per person, kids under 9 were $6. As soon as we approached the food you could tell the quality was poor. The counters were dirty and had been that way a while because it was dried and baked on the counter. The food was all mixed in with old, I'll just stop it was terrible. The flavor was terrible. The best part of this place was the soda with its taste of dirty tap water. Should have just gone to panda! I feel ripped off. Oh drinks are extra. I'm about to leave, I hope I don't get food poisoning, some seafood tasted off."}
{"text":"This is some good ass authentic Chinese food! Everything we ordered was fresh and fantastic! Now don't let the old run down dusty dirty decor effect your opinion of the food and the quality of the meal. I just wish the owners took a bit more pride in the atmosphere, it was dirty and had a dive feel. But that won't stop me from eating here again next time I visit Pittsburgh, PA."}
{"text":"Great meal today. Everything was great.Service was somewhat slow. Miriam & David"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of some of the typical buffet style Chop Suey houses we had in Honolulu back in 1980's. Though, the style of traditional Chinese menu items have change and become more Americanized since.  From the aroma as you walk in, the noise of all the restaurant patrons present, to the hustling servers, the atmosphere altogether is chaotic and amusing at the same time, and I like a little chaos.  The food encompasses many popular asian particulars and a wonderful selection of seafood fare. There is also a made to order stir fry chef for those who would like exclusive specialty dishes.  The dessert bar is simple maintaining a variety of ethnic pastries, cookies, fruit and jello molds.  For you soup lovers, there's a vareity of four options,  focusing on the more popular ones often typical in any American Chinese menu.  Good food, perfect for family or friends to gather and enjoy some easy ready chinese or American fare, definitely stop by.  If I was to recommend anything from the buffet line-here are my fave picks:  Char Sui Roasted Pork Chicken Wings Mongolian beef, Pan fried pot stickers (Gyoza)  Take advantage of the stir fry specialties where the chefs will cook it on the spot!  Aloha - NJoy your Ono GrindZ!"}
{"text":"This was the worse Chinese food ever...the food had no flavor!...I had the cold shrimp...it was watery like they've had the shrimp in cold water for days. It tasted mushy...never saw crab ragoons made like triangles but they were good..the low mein noodle were mushy. No taste either...anything shrimp in it was awful...The soft serve ice cream was good...Only sodas they have are Pepsi and Sprite...The place was clean"}
{"text":"I come to vegas every 3 months and have tried a lot of buffets  This is authentic Chinese food and omg price is great and the chow mein n fried rice is better than any expensive place . I prefer this place than the Wynn buffet  Great"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my friend. The staff repeatedly laughed after leaving our table exclaiming the number of plates they had taken. The food was undercooked and either bland or just bad. The majority of the restaurant was dirty and there were visible dirty rags on bottles of cleaner next to the filthy ice cream machine.  Please don't do yourself the disservice of coming here, it's just terrible and you will regret it."}
{"text":"I have been bugging a buddy to hit this place up for lunch for quite some time now. We wound up here after the wait at another spot was much too long. For less than seven bucks you can't go wrong. It is what it is. Low cost, mediocre food in enormous quantities is what you are anticipating, right?  There was literally no wait and we were seated immediately. That's about where three stars ends and two stars begins. There was no broccoli beef, but a small amount of broccoli chicken. They did offer both egg rolls and spring rolls with some of the hottest mustard I've ever had. The cheese wontons were surprisingly good, as were the BBQ pork skewers. Well, the one skewer that was left anyway. We never saw another skewer and were there close to an hour.  I wasn't expecting top shelf dining at a Chinese buffet.  However, I was expecting to eat as much as I wanted. How can you when they don't have any food out? It was as if they were getting ready to close and didn't want to put out more food. This was 12:30 in the afternoon. It's lunch time for crying out loud and we are hungry.   The service was decent, as was the food we could actually get ahold of. I have to go with two stars for the simple fact that a buffet should have food or at least make an effort to fill it up when it runs empty. Save yourself the two dollars and drink water, as the price does not include a beverage. I will probably give it another shot and update the review if it warrants a different rating."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the modest appearance and low price: China Star is absolutely hands-down the best Chinese food for twice the money in Las Vegas. Here's why:  * Cooked to order stir-fry bar. Not just for dinner, but for lunch. Beef, pork, fresh vegetables. Find that for $6.49.  * A handful of superb dishes: coconut chicken, seafood rockefeller, fried chicken, all of the soups, black pepper chicken.  * Solid support dishes: Fried rice and chow mein are both above par.  Not everything is a home run; you'll find better General Tso's chicken and mongolian beef elsewhere. But most items are on point and the service is fast and attentive. Mega-like!"}
{"text":"Totally gross and dirt. Our waiter was not even decently dressed and smelled of sweat BO. The food seems dirty and is not tasty at all.  Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill is much better."}
{"text":"Not a fan. First, let's start with the fact that they watch over you as you choose your food and then stare at you while you eat it. So uncomfortable. Our seats in the booth were coming apart and torn and we had to adjust the cushion each time we got up. The food wasn't great either. Nothing was fresh and many of the dishes weren't labeled so it was a guess when choosing some. We also didn't get refills on our drinks at all. We came here a few years ago and it wasn't this bad, service and quality of food has definitely declined. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Within the last month or so, I have been in this restaurant probably five times. For the price, I think is a very good deal. I'm quite impressed with the food; so much so that I have taken three friends there with me.  If at all possible, I would recommend visiting throughout the week. I have been twice on the weekend and it is just too packed for my own taste. The staff are friendly, the food is good, the price is right. This one gets a five star rating from me!"}
{"text":"I came in from out of town on business on 6/20/16 for a late dinner. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was hard to chew and probably had freezer burns. This was the worst Moo Goo I ever had. The only thing edible was the white rice.  Phil"}
{"text":"We tried this place last night and are so very glad we did! Nice, clean place with a relaxed atmosphere. The waitress was good and didn't hover. I ordered the sesame chicken combo platter. Portions were good-sized and plated very prettily. That was one thing that surprised me, actually. Most Chinese places just mound it on a Styrofoam plate and call it good enough. Here, someone actually put some thought into it; I wish I would have taken a picture, but I was too hungry. :) The only complaint I have is the egg rolls were a little tough and chewy. We were given a small plate of quartered oranges for dessert, which was a nice palate cleanser, not to mention just plain tasty! I'm even more happy that they deliver to us in Verona-yay! We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"As far as cheap buffets go, this is the best one I've ever been to. Great tasting food, friendly staff, and excellence in cleanliness, specially given that it's an inexpensive buffet. Everything I tried was good. If you're on a budget and want to eat at a buffet,  this is the place to go. By the way, I've eaten at the Rio and the Monte Carlo buffets and by comparison this deserves 5 starts for it's level difference."}
{"text":"I'm going to settle this once and for all, since everyone seems beyond confused about the three China Stars in town. I drive past both of the Murray Ave China Stars every day (both located across the street from a Giant Eagle, presumably just to puzzle us more) and based on the addresses have confirmed the following--  THIS CHINA STAR: -4219 Murray Ave, in Greenfield -At the old location of Yen's Gourmet -No affiliation with the China Star in the North Hills -Standard American-Chinese food  THE OTHER CHINA STAR (http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-pittsburgh-3): -1900 Murray Ave, in Squirrel Hill -At the old location of Pacific Ring -Affiliated with the China Star in the North Hills -Traditional Chinese food  So, there you have it. A guide to the China Stars of Murray Avenue. I, personally, have only ordered from this China Star and cannot comment on the other.  For Chinese takeout--and I mean cheap, greasy, fried \"Chinese\" food--China Star is awesome. I mean, yeah, every Chinese takeout place with the infamous red menu is pretty much the same, and I feel stupid even writing a review of one on Yelp. But I get a craving for General Tso's Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Cold Sesame Noodles, and Fried Dumplings about once a month, and now having tried several of Pittsburgh's Chinese options based on price and convenience, I gotta say China Star is my number one choice. Everything just tastes GOOD. I totally can't justify giving a Chinese restaurant more than 3 stars, but next time you feel the need to pig out on greasy takeout food, I'd highly recommend China Star."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch yesterday because I had a craving for szechuan and this is about the only place in the Burgh to get it.  My friend and I had three dishes--Tan Tan (Dan-Dan) noodles, asparagus and crab soup and double cooked pork belly.  On the whole, the dishes were good.  The noodles in the tan-tan noodles appeared to be like regular linguine noodles that you get at a supermarket and they were a little overcooked.  I would have expected \"lo mein\" style noodles--thick and round.  The sauce was tasty but not a spicy as I would have liked or expected.  The asparagus and crab soup was good with big chunks of crab and pieces of asparagus that I mistook for scallions and lots of egg ribbons--could have used a little more seasoning - very good but filling.  The double cooked pork belly was the highlight of the meal. Large pieces of sautéed pork belly with szechuan peppercorn flakes (I really did experience the mouth numbing spice).  The leeks were wonderful--tender and lightly sautéed.  I could have eaten a lot more of them.  I was surprised by the use of jalapeño peppers in the dish.  The peppers were fresh and large.  I highly recommend this dish which is filling but not heavy.    The service was ok--a little slow at times despite the fact that the restaurant was not crowded.    A still have a lot of other dished to try here.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Reliable Chinese delivery at a good price.  Once you learn what they do well (General Tso's chicken, the duck dishes, lo mein, teriyaki chicken, shrimp egg rolls, steamed and fried dumplings) and what they do not-so-well (won ton soup, fried rice, regular egg rolls)*, you can have a pretty consistently good experience with them.  Online ordering makes things a lot easier, the delivery folks are polite and arrive within the estimated time, and the food is pretty good.  Also, one night we ordered a little close to closing time and arrived a few minutes late to pick it up, and they were very nice about sticking around for us.    I wish I could give it a less lukewarm endorsement, but going from the Asian food of San Francisco, CA to that of Swissvale, PA has been a little bit jarring.  All in all, no major complaints; it's great to have a dependable Saturday-night-in staple for the fiance and I.   *The won ton soup and regular egg rolls are so-so, but passable; the fried rice is just abysmal.  If you want fried rice, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The people there are very accomadating.  I asked for a specail sauce and they made it for me without hesitation.  I enjoy the jalepeno chicken, chicken wings, sfuffed shrimp, fried rice, soup (hot and sour) fish.  They add fried shrimp and so other dishes on Sat. & Sun but charge a little more.  If you tell the people what you want, they will happily do their best to get it to you.  I think this place deserves to be given a try.  The desert bar is decent and they give you a card for a free meal after 10 visits, that's like a dollar off each meal."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was great. There's some stuff lying around the inside and looks like they are doing some renovation. No complaints"}
{"text":"This is delicious chinese take out! For meat eaters, they have this great dinner deal where you get a soup, an eggroll, some sort of entree like cashew chicken and a cookie for under $10! They also deliver, don't have a minimum on credit cards and are overall great."}
{"text":"Man there was a lot of food here! The wait staff was nice and prompt. It is a buffet, and there were all ages here from babys to grandparents, so family friendly I would say yes.. The food was pretty darn good for the price! I don't know if I will be a regular here (mainly cuz I don't care for small humans, they tend to be loud) But for the price the food was better than most fast food options out there and a good mix to choose from.."}
{"text":"Warning: This place used to be called Ruby's Oriental.  One of the worst of the worst kind of Chinese restaurants-in-a-box.  The idea that this place calls itself a \"Chinese\" restaurant in a city which boasts several authentic Chinese places (the best of which, Ichiban, is not to be missed!) is a joke.  The food is tasteless and full of veggie filler.  The sesame chicken was, quite literally, inedible.  It tasted like old socks.  Nasty food brought to your door is still nasty food.  Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"When we select two stars, we see the sentence \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" will appear. Sadly I have experienced better. From the same place! My wife and I first tried China Star several years ago and we absolutely loved it.  Upon entering you will find the host station to your right. IF you make a u-turn to your immediate right that is.  The staff was polite, I think. Most of the staff mumbled towards me wife and myself.  Food was okay depending on what you had. I love mongolian bbq and this time it didn't disapoint. Except for the order I put the hot asian sauce on. Just a tad too much. But that is my fault.  I also tried what was labled as \"black pepper chicken\". I took a few bites and the few that I took, each one was of cold food.   What really is the cause for my low number of stars for this place is the cleanliness.   The wife noticed \"dust bunnies\" along the ceiling fans. The kitchen had different style and patterened floor tiles. But what I type next is what really bothered my wife.  Near the kitchen, is a door frame with a \"blanket\" of sorts hanging in place of a proper door. The \"blanket\" looked to be quite dirty. Made my wife wonder when the last time it was properly washed.  Two people who work for China Star, were seen seated at a dining room table near the kitchen. The folks were seen snapping what appeared to be green beans without gloves on their hands. These two same people were seen serving guests, taking orders and such. Never were they seen leaving the dining room area to wash their hands.  Sorry China Star but I must say, in closing, what my wife and I once thought as a bright and shinning star, has becoming a falling star."}
{"text":"I was kind of skeptical about this buffet because of all the reviews but decided to try it out anyway and I wasn't disappointed! Had a lot of chicken options but I'm not complaining. China Star is your usual decent Chinese buffet. Can't ask for more with their prices and their customer service was great. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's Labor Day. So I guess I expected the price to go up a little bit, it's 9.99. But wouldn't the food be better today as well? There's no crawfish like usual and none of my vermicelli rice noodles that I like so much here, I usually put that into my soup. My teriyaki chicken was cold as well and I didn't bother trying the sushi, it didn't look very fresh. All the times I've been here the food has been pretty good. Very disappointed in this trip. We came around 5pm. Two stars for the friendly service and always getting our drinks refilled.   After we ate, my boyfriend and I came to the conclusion that their shrimp ceviche made up for them not having crawfish or my favorite noodles. That fish was deeelish!"}
{"text":"This used to be an OK buffet for the money it is now the worst tasting Chinese food I have never had and the rudest waitresses I've ever seen I will never and I mean never eat here again"}
{"text":"The best and authentic chinese restaurant in pittsburgh. Traditional Shichun dishes, some are spicy but really good. Roast dock and deep fry intestines are my favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Wanted delivery which they list as available on the website- not the case though. I had to pick it up. This place is really dingy. I would not eat in. Though I was able to call my order in when I arrived I was told the phone didn't work and I would not be able to use a credit card. Weird. But it worked out.   Onto the food! Vegetable lo mein and fried pork dumplings were the stars of the show- would order both again. The general tsos chicken, veggie dumplings, and egg roll left much to be desired and I would not order again. The beef with broccoli and chicken with broccoli were fine."}
{"text":"Located just past the Home Depot on West Craig Road, this is my favorite non-casino buffet option in town.  It's not too far away from home so it's always very easy to get to and the variety and quality of the food is consistently good. I should mention that I invariably come here for lunch - never been here for dinner - which I believe also gives you the most bang for the approximately $8.00 cost.  There have been many Chinese or  Asian-style buffets like this that have closed during the past few years; this one has staying power and has now been around for 11 years and counting.  My father was always very partial to their small Chinese dumplings usually stuffed with pork - quite happily piling them high on  his plate.  Service is quick and the experience is always stress-free which makes for good digestion and a most enjoyable experience overall."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a cheap buffet. $6.95 plus drink lunch special buffet. It looks like any other Chinese buffet. The food is in the center and the tables/ booths are around.   The food is your typical American style Chinese buffet spread. You have egg rolls, cream cheese wontons, chow mien, rice, BBQ pork, chicken on a stick, clams, broccoli chicken, Kung pow chicken, etc. There is a grill for you to make your own food.   To me the food was lousy. Everything was really sweet. Too sweet to my tastes. But for the price and the amount it just filled me up. I couldn't find anything spicy or flavorful. So I guess it's perfect for bland tastes."}
{"text":"It should it should be called china trash for the absolutely disgusting food.. Nothing but a whole bunch of Mexicans fighting over crabs  and shrimp will never come back hopefully I wont diarrhea warning stay away!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there and had delivery...both options were great. Food was fresh, delicious and lots of it ! Could tell they make it up at the time of ordering and used fresh ingredients. Our favorite place for Chinese."}
{"text":"Reasonable.   Had the Hunan Trio with black bean sauce which had shrimp, beef and chicken (although the beef was supposed to be scallops). I would say it was quite tasty for Pittsburgh Chinese food. There was an fair amount of food with a decent amount of meat in it. A bit greasy, but what American Chinese places aren't, right?  The interior looks like hell and the lady who must own the place didn't have the best Engrish skills, but the taste of the food made up for the losses.  Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars Relative Price = 3 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 1 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"I heard that China Star catered the Chinese delegates when G20 was here and I could totally believe it!   The hubby and I were in the mood for Chinese, but real Chinese not that fake American take out stuff that people pretend is Chinese. So we hit up China Star. That was 7 visits ago. We are in love. We always order the Tan Tan noodles and Mapo Tofu because it's amazing. We also like to rotate the second dish around and have tried a variety of different dishes. All of which have been amazing.   If you are in the mood for real Chinese check this place out and make sure you order from the correct menu (there are 3!)"}
{"text":"There was a rumbly in my tumbly.  And thank goodness it wasn't food poisoning!  I must have been super hungry on the day I went into this China Star.  I'm doing what I can for this place here, but it just wasn't up to par.  Yes, it's a super cheap lunch for around $5-6 but remember...you get what you pay for sometimes.  At this China Star it's not much.  The food is decent and you won't have any problems if you've got a strong stomach like I do.  There are your usual dishes like the fried rice, noodles, fried chicken wings, beef and broccoli, and won ton soup.  But I just feel it's all on lower standards.  A lot of the stuff on the day I went was definitely sitting under the heat lamp for a bit, causing a lot of items to be surrounded by a pool of grease.  Ever see coconut chicken after a long bath under a heat lamp?  Trust me you don't want to.  Things tasted rubbery and lackluster.  Soup was cold and the faux sushi was warm.  Wow, and I'm not usually very picky when it comes to eating!  Sad food make me a sad boy.  I'm not usually too critical of the atmosphere either since I've been to dives that were dingy but had good food.  But this China Star over here on Charleston?  It is a bit dirtier than I can accept.  Food bits stuck here and there on the floor, having to clear particles off your seat before you sit down, and sneeze guards looking a little bit questionable?  Aw, come on!  I like my beats fast and my bass down low, but the only thing I like dirty (occasionally) is my lady!  Going to the bathroom is a great gauge on how to tell if a place is clean.  Trust me, going to the bathroom here (which I did) may make you queasy!  There was a roach running around in there.  I tried to ignore it....but yeah, it was still there.  I said hello to it, but it just scurried along its way...probably going back to the kitchen to grab a smoke.  Ack!  I really feel sorry for the ladies that have to actually sit on the seat in the women's restroom.     There's not much else I can say about this place for now, I'm getting a bit light-headed thinking about it.  Please, please, please China Star...clean your act up!  This is coming from the guy who loves a cheap buffet and can live with a little bit of uncleanliness.  Live up to your 'A' rating!"}
{"text":"This place isn't much to see.  I really would have never known it was there until a former roommate ate here.  They have great lunch special prices.  I really only go here when I want Black Pepper chicken and Crab Cheese Wontons.  It is one of the best of these that I have ever tasted.  The prices are decent and the service ok.  I've only had takeout though.  I guess if you're looking for takeout in the Greenfield/Squirrel Hill area, give them a try."}
{"text":"Don't ignore the signs in a drity place! You'll Regret it I promise you! A little bit of Diarrhea should not happen if you don't get Diarrhea at home you shouldn't here either! Just stating the facts nasty!  This place is so gross and dirty the sneeze guard was dripped with water from it being so steamy. than black green yellowish brown crap more like shit dripped on my plate and the food on the line. I told the manager out loud and showed all the customers what was on my hand on my plate.  I told everyone to get up and leave and I told the manager nobody is paying. I told him I'm reporting him t the health department an he played the we will looooose are jobs, its not our fault, what do you want?  Also the I never get sick don't do this to a small business owner. everyone got up and left. I will never go there again an the other customers wont either. Manager said \" I NEVER GET SICK FROM THIS FOOD\"! NASTY NASTY NASTY!  I took pictures check it out. thanks for reading =*.*= DON'T BE BLIND! CHEAP IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD IT CAN MAKE YOU SICK OPEN UP YOUR PURSE STINGS COME ON! SPEND A COUPLE MORE BUCKS ON FOOD THAT IS CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Let's get a couple of things straight first, this is a buffet style Chinese restaurant with a very affordable price tag (around $20 for two).  That means...don't expect 5 Star food.  Let's be honest, when was the last time you spent $10 on any buffet and thought the food was \"as good as it gets\"? That's what I thought.  But if you know of a place, hit me up.  China Star Buffet is located in North Las Vegas off Craig Rd.  I've been here about 3 times in the last 2 years and each time was because one of my team members wanted to eat here.  I take my team out for lunch just as a reward every once in awhile.  I give them the choice where to eat and they usually pick something cheap.  I'm not complaining, that just means less expenses for me.  I still think they select something cheap so that I don't expect more from them, lol.  Anyways, China Star Buffet seems to be their favorite.   This restaurant has your basic Chinese buffet food like wontons, egg drop soup, sweet/sour chicken, wannabe sushi, fish, skewers, crispy noodles, fried rice, and even pieces of pizza.  Everything listed happens to be everything I've tried and the food is just okay.  But again, I don't expect too much from establishments like this.    The service is A+.  This might be because I have a Chinese last name.  Yeah I'm one of those that flashes my ID at places like this to get superior service, joke only.  But seriously, the service has always been great from being seated quickly, drinks kept full, table cleaned, and check provided when needed.   Overall, I cannot give this place no less than 3 stars because you get what you pay for and the food quality is what they strive for.    PS:  On my last visit, my fortune cookie read \"Learn Chinese\".  Rosetta Stone here I come."}
{"text":"I used to work in the OfficeMax, two doors down. Perhaps I was sick of Subway every day, but I LOVED ordering here! The hot and sour soup is the best BY FAR I have ever had. I first ordered General Tso's chicken (my qualifier dish when trying a new spot), and you know what? I keep ordering it!   Ask for extra spicy and no one will try stealing bites!"}
{"text":"I order from China Star all the time, mostly because it is two minutes from my house.  Their food is pretty good, and for $7.50 you get a dinner that includes soup, an egg roll, fried or steamed rice and a large (although they call it \"small\") portion of entree.  I make two or three meals out of a General Tso's combo dinner.  My favorites here are the crab rangoon and wonton soup.  Deelish!"}
{"text":"I ate here a little while ago for dinner with my girlfriend.  Originally I had been turned onto this place and their Sichuan style cooking by a couple of grad school friends from China and wanted my girlfriend to experience it as well.  We decided to start off our meals with the pickled vegetables in red oil.  Whenever our dish was served a man who I am assuming to be the owner stopped over and explained the many spices in the oil.  Even before he had mentioned it we could easily taste the complexity of the dish and really enjoyed it.  For our entrees we both ordered off the Sichuan menu with my girlfriend getting the salt and pepper squid while I got the extremely spicy Chongquing chicken.  My girlfriends dish was good while not being spicy at all.  The entree I had was a different story although I had been aware of that when ordering.  My chicken was fried nicely and cooked with some spicy dried peppers and prickly ash ( Sichuan pepper) added in.  If you have never had it before the pepper can be described as giving a numbing taste.  I ended up thoroughly enjoying my entree between all of the flavors.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here again.  They have all of your normal Chinese food in addition to being one of a few places to have an authentic Sichuan menu which is sure to take your tastebuds for a wild ride."}
{"text":"In one word YUCK!  There isn't a very big selection to choose from. The walls are disgusting. There is grease and nastiness oozing from the walls. The top of the saracha bottles are caked in black goop. We never got a refill on our drinks. Our \"waitress\" was too busy chatting it up with the other employees to even check on us. We definitely will not be back and I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a god experience dining here food was good and service was pleasant"}
{"text":"I ordered combo #11, General Tso's Chicken with steamed rice and Hot & Sour soup. The delivery was fast, the driver was polite and personable and the food was yummy. I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid.  These people seem to have a thing for bringing their kids into work, and one of the little bastards tried to drop kick me as I walked in the door. I should've left then. The place was filthy; they must have friends in high places that keep them from being shut down. I was in a big hurry because I was on a break from work, so I took a chance and ordered chicken lo mein. It was edible. The young guy working behind the counter was very polite, but that doesn't make up for the filth, and the attempted drop kick. Try Springgarden or King Fong instead."}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and good hospitality."}
{"text":"While I was in the soup area I grabbed a bowl, and what i saw was a little bug looked like a cockroach wandering all over the soup bowls. I told the lady that was working there and immediately showed her the bug. She replaced the bowls, but didn't say anything. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I just order some food from here it was HOT AND FRESH YUMMY"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick,  inexpensive,  and delicious flavorful lunch.  It is a modest building with old decor, however the spread of the varieties of Chinese food is quite impressive from simple steam rice to baked salmon. Mongolian style meals are available. The service was attentive, prompt, and courteous."}
{"text":"LOVE this place (if only for the music lol). Lunch - $7, Dinner - $9.69 is a solid value for this medium to large sized local buffet. They have CRAWFISH!!! Now unfortunately the cleanliness of the men's restroom leaves something to be desired but you don't go to a place for the restrooms unless its Seamless strip club.  Try the egg flower soup, eggrolls, peanut butter chicken, CRAWFISH, broccoli beef, siu mai, won tons, baked mussels and scallops.  STAY AWAY - sushi, pizza"}
{"text":"We Americans like the Chinese buffet.  We know its not authentic.  We know its not healthy.  But, it satisfies some sinful desire.  Pizza, burgers, Mexican food, Chinese buffet.  It is part of the American culinary fabric.  If this sounds like you then this is your place.  It is always busy, so you know the food has not been sitting around long.  The patrons appear to be lower income.  The location is great.  Parking in the front and side are usually pretty full, so expect to park around back.  The employees are friendly, but don't expect much English.  The lunch buffet is $7.99.  What a bargain!  FYI: Bus loads of Chinese tourists arrive often, so beware because they will clean that place out.  I'll admit, this place is one of my guilty pleasures, just don't expect quality from a $7.99 buffet.  And, don't tell my foodie friends that I eat here.       ; - )"}
{"text":"?????????????????"}
{"text":"We had a good lunch here today.  Wontons in red oil were pretty good, though the wonton wrappers were very heavy.  Scallion pancake was tasty but a little greasy and lacking the satisfying crunch of my homemade ones.  The chicken with spicy peppers was fabulous, with dried red chiles, pieces of fresh green chile and a punch of Sichuan peppercorns.  Salt and pepper shrimp was very good, if slightly less assertive than my favorite.  The sauteed snow pea leaf was lovely, with delicate flavorings of garlic and maybe ginger that let the greens' flavor shine through.  This is definitely the only place I have had authentic Sichuan food in the city.  Definitely get the Chinese menu."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, good food, great prices and polite staff.    I highly recommend the Dim Sum, Egg Drop soup (with the fried noodles, of course!) and their Chow Mein Noodles.    There were a couple of dishes that we didn't care for, but all in all it was a good restaurant for the price!"}
{"text":"This is your cookie-cutter, Americanized, Ma & Pa on-a-budget Chinese cafe.  Parking was good.  Dining experience was not.  I had the shrimp with bean sauce and white rice.  I thought the portions were small for what I paid.  The shrimp were small and the veges were hard to find.  Service is very casual.  In the evening we dined at Happy Wok (Northeast location) which was superior."}
{"text":"I love it here, I come all the time with my mom. A most everyone has a great attitude and they're really friendly. Plus, their food is really good."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviews, stay away! Bathroom are disgustingly dirty and the food isn't much better. I had half of plate of what i believe was to be beef and broccoli and 3 chicken wings. Way to much unappealing looking seafood, it killed my whole spirit after paying and walking out thank god pollo campers next door was still open. I know there's better options in Vegas"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this buffet style setting but a few years back. Does anyone know if this place is still open?  My friends and I would come here and enjoy the food. Very popular place, every time I had been here it was boomin with business"}
{"text":"Used to be Yen's...we love this place.  The service has always been friendly and quick.  They have accommodated us with menu changes whenever we've asked.  They do have a small dining area, but there never seems to be too many people there.  It's basic \"chinese\" take out, good amount of food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yucky to the max!!!!! My husband actually LIKED eating here until I found a roach in the bathroom and a gnat in my coconut chicken. He loves this place mostly because of the stir fry station.    But other then that all the food is below temp and no I don't even NEED a thermometer to tell me this! There is no doubt about it. I can see why people can be lured by the $5.99 lunch special but I personally don't like paying for bugs! It's gone way down hill since we first started going. And as soon as I saw bugs I quit eating here. My sister in law then got a job at a DIFFERENT Chinese buffet and after what she's seen she will never eat at any of these cheap \"Chinese\" buffets again. If employees won't eat the food who should??  Every time we eat here the managers/owners are eating completely different food. I've never seen them eat the buffets food. So this should be a sign right!?! Okay so I guess ill explain a little about the crappy food. Pizza-super rubbery cheese almost always under cooked  All if the \"Chinese\" food-BLAND  The stir fry has ok choices but the meat looks funny. If your going to eat here I'd stick with this to be safe. My husband always had to use the bathroom a ton after he ate here.  Speaking if the bathrooms they stink like someone pooped on the floor. And if you DARE look up the vents have an inch of dust stuck to them.  Save your money and lots of time on the toilet and eat somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Since Orient House changed management, I have been looking for a good chinese place. To this day, I continue to search but will give China Star the benefit of the doubt.  I tried China Star off a limb. I ordered a combination platter - sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. It comes with an eggroll. I asked if the eggroll had pork in it and was told yes. Since I do not eat pork, I wanted to sub it out for a veggie spring roll and was told it was an upcharge. So I kept the basic egg roll and gave my eggroll to my boyfriend who said it was filled with nothing but cabbage. I still ordered a side of spring rolls. My good, they were the size of my pinky finger! No exaggeration. I actually measured them. Very small and filled with nothing but grease. Hardly what I would call to be a spring roll. Two bites is all it takes to finish them. ( you get two per order)   I must say however, the fried rice was better than I expected. It had bean sprouts in it which is a plus. To me, Chinese food is not complete without the sprouts. The entire meal (entree) was good. They could have left out the pineapple chunks but it wasn't a big deal  My boyfriend had an order of potstickers and egg drop soup. According to him, it was very good. Again, since I do not eat pork ( potstickers) and do not care for egg drop soup, I didn't bother to try either.  Lastly, I love crab ragoon. For me, this makes or breaks a Chinese restaurant. I was extremely disappointed with China Star ragoon. Absolutely the worst ragoon I've ever eaten and trust me, I've had my share including brands you can buy at the store. Very bland, no flavor and hardly any filling. Basically just cream cheese filled in an extremely oily, deep fried and hard pastry shell. Plus, they are the size of a 3 year old hand. For the price you pay to get 6 ragoons, they should be larger in size and taste better. Yuck!  Overall, I China Star is decent but they could be so much better. My quest for a good Chinese restaurant in Madison continues on. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to Chinese restaurant, especially since I lived right down the street. Unfortunately, they have raised their prices at least twice in the past couple of months, which has resulted in me taking my business elsewhere. The food remains delicious as always, but it shouldn't cost me $30 for appetizers. I'd rather eat a pizza and appetizer for $20 instead."}
{"text":"We order in from here about once a month.  It's typical \"red menu\" Chinese but tastes very good.  We always get takeout.  They have yet to mess up an order.  If you are nearby this is the best Chinese in Greenfield Sq. Hill."}
{"text":"Fried rice is the best ive ever had and all there food is super fresh. I loved the pepper steak and chop suey. Only complaint i wish they had roasted duck. Will keep going back again and again."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad. I used to call and get delivery from them often because it was very convenient. That is, until I received the wrong order. When I called them the owner was extremely rude and nasty to me and blamed me for their mistake. That was about 6 months ago. Today I was craving Chinese but  didn't want to leave the house, I decided to give them another chance. I called about 4 times and got absolutely no answer. Such horrible, bad business. Now no matter how bad my cravings and laziness are.... I will never ever get food from this dump again!!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at China Star for a few years now. The Hot & Sour soup is the best in Madison. Their fried rice (Shrimp, specifically), the house specialty noodles & the crab rangoon are also good. I wouldn't say China Star is the best Chinese food I've ever had, but I have tried various places around the city and it's definitely the best I have had in Madison."}
{"text":"Will not go back again, the food looked slimey, lack of choice in selection, food was not hot, just kind of warm.  Families with kids running around buffet area being loud and annoying.  Sat in the back and waiter for that section just stood by our table looking at everyone all weird,  no thanks china star"}
{"text":"The waiter was kind. The food was actually better than the last BUT that evening and the next day I felt horrible! I got all the symptoms of food poisoning going on day 3 today. I had the same food as my mother only difference is I had seafood. Honestly I wouldn't go to back here. I've gone to other buffets and had the fortune of not getting sick. I probably won't have chinese food in Vegas. I've never felt this sh*tty. Litterally."}
{"text":"China Star serves decent Chinese food at a good price. They stopped lunch delivery on weekends, which sucks, but beside that and the occasional missing egg roll, this place is great, and my workplace orders here about once a week.   Their General Tso's is super yummy, as is the Amazing chicken."}
{"text":"I seriously hate trying new places, especially for chinese food cause you never know if it's gonna be the same as ones you tried before. So anyways I was out of luck because the other close by was closed or at least wasn't answering and I'm super hungry. So I decided to order a pint of Sweet and Sour Chicken for 5.25 served with a side of rice, and fried dumplings. I got a huge portion of chicken and a huge pool to dip my chicken in which was amazing to say the least. And the dumplings, they weren't as I've had before, they were really full of flavor, the sauce it was served with was a little thicker, which I really enjoyed because it didn't drip all over me and it was so flavorful. The dumplings were really big compared to the ones I've had at other places. Anyways, long story short I love this place! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I have been to several china star buffets throughout las vegas. This buffet was by far the worst in terms of customer service, presentation of food , and taste. We came during lunch hour and the cashier insisted on charging dinner prices even though dinner items werent even out yet. We proceeded to start eating and seen food looked old, like it had been sitting hours. Im usally pretty easy about stuff but was disgusted. My suspicions were confirmed once i opened the white rice steemer which has a lid over it. The rice was browning on top and was crisp. Also nobody came to see how we were doing or if we needed anything . it was just pour your drinks and go, we had plates stacking up the table. I will never ever come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We showed up at 10:30 yesterday and was told to leave because they don't open until 11, which i didn't mind but don't be rude about it. We wait outside in the heat only to find that the people who came in right after us had already been seated and had gotten their food. I don't know why we were sent away. Finally got to sit down and eat and the food, even though freshly made was awful. I almost vomited when i smelled the clam cakes. I had half a plate because that's all i could stomach. My husband and i are both suffering from a very upset stomach today. I don't recommend going. Big waste of money and you will be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Totally got sick from eating here. Everything taste like grease. No flavor and they literally have cleaning supplies and floor calking supplies on shelves under the food trays. I left and didn't pay."}
{"text":"We've only taken food home from here. It doesn't seem like the cleanest place. Why would I eat here? I think the heat in the cooking process kills anything that might be bad and the food tastes good. I like this place."}
{"text":"Cheap price to begin with and the kids were STILL discounted! Nothing to complain about. There is an acceptable variety of items for a reasonable price. The staff was friendly and kept up our table and drinks exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience 1st time here. I don't if it was because it was Saturday 1030am but i beat the crowd it got crowded after i arrived lol.  I walked in & was greeted quickly by the host I'll assume very nice looking & approachable if i just had a question so it looked... My server also very polite & attentive my glass was refilled right as i was bout to run out lol great service. Food was fantastic & yummy! Service was good I'll be back.  This stop i was by myself because I was waiting for my cars oil change nearby at Wal-Mart  Not too bad at all 9.00 total  I don't know if they accept tips. I'm sure they do so i left 15.00 $6 tip :) thank you again China Star is a Five (5) Star"}
{"text":"I am perplexed by all of the great reviews.  I ordered Kung Bao Chicken and it has to be the worst I have ever had.  The egg roll and crab Rangoon were good but I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food - especially after no lunch and a martini for dinner, however, your dollars are best spent elsewhere than here, at least when it comes to delivery.   My favorite \"Chinese\" dish is that of general tso's tofu - I was delighted to see they offered it. The tofu I received was a small (by comparison to other local establishments) portion with 6 pieces of semi-cooked, dry, broccoli. These things I can move beyond, what I cannot look past is the sickly sweet orange sauce the tofu was marinating in. It was closer to duck sauce than anything to the garlic & spicy mix I was expecting, simply awful and inedible.  I also ordered some hot and sour soup. This was middle of the road and nothing I would seek out considering the higher price point. The soup did not come with 'crispies' and the rice that was served was FAR from fresh steamed...  My fella had the pepper steak and onion which he said was great, however, the onions were really undercooked...he also ordered chicken wings with buffalo sauce. This dish arrived totally dry - no sauce.  We pre-ordered delivery with a scheduled time of 8:30p. The driver arrived just before 8p and even though he had been generously tipped with the online payment the driver still lingered and pressed for an additional tip...very bizarre...  To top it all off the dishes were relatively cold and no sauces, napkins, or silverware were included...nor any fortune cookie! Yeah, it's dumb but I like it! I have no intention of ordering from here again...sad as I was really hoping this spot would step it up..."}
{"text":"Worst delivery service ever. Driver shoved the food in my hand and told me he wouldn't deliver to me again  because it was too far. I'm fairly certain that should have been decided when I placed my order. I called to see what the issue was and no one could help because they didn't speak English. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"So my brother was really craving asian food, and thought it would be best to just eat here again since it's been a while and he wanted a buffet because of the AYCE, plus it was the closest to us at the time.  We went to their dinner time for the first time, and I was EXTREMELY disappointed!! They basically only had two different foods compared to their lunch time! Buffets are suppose to have alot more variety/different foods served from lunch time compared to dinner time. So we paid more for something that should be the same cost as their lunch time. That really ticked me off. Going at dinner time was a complete waste of money. If you liked their food during their dinner time, just go to their lunch time and your basically get everything the same, with a cheaper price.  Also, their fried rice wasn't exactly fried. It was still white rice with vegetables added to it. Their crab legs that they added to their dinner had a very bad soup/sauce added to it. The legs weren't even big enough to get enough meat to satisfy someone.  Still loved their service. My waiters were amazingly nice. However, that alone does not compensate for their food and how they run things.  I'm chinese and have eaten at a ton of asian buffets! And trust me when i say, if you know your asian food like a pro, your definitely not going to like this place!"}
{"text":"Most disgusting experience of my life.  Came here one afternoon because the reviews on Yelp were all good....what in the world are you people talking about?!?  Service was awful.  Asked for drinks three times, never got them.  Got up and asked for them, cashier actually pointed to the fridge behind the counter so I had to get them myself.  Food came out....ew.  Chicken and vegetables..the chicken looked like some sort of gelatin. Fried rice was a huge softball sized clump of cold, crunchy rice. Then, as I was poking at my food looking for any reason not to eat it...I found it:   a nice, loooong, wiry strand of black hair wrapped around my veggies and staring at me like a water moccasin.    The gentleman REFUSED to take the entree off of my check.  Then, he refused to give us the check altogether until I ordered something else to replace my chicken entree.  FAT CHANCE, DUDE.  I actually had to throw a ten on a table, grab my stuff, and get the hell outta there, never to look back.  Please, stay far, far away from this place.  I  am surprised we haven't gotten sick yet!  (Not to mention the delivery guy that was sitting on the hood of my car out front of the restaurant).  Yea...not good.  Not good at all."}
{"text":"Great prices great portions! The lo mien dishes are delicious however I would not recommend the egg rolls (bland). Family owned restaurant and they are super friendly! Whenever we want an inexpensive, quick Chinese meal we pick up our food from here."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Attentive waiters, delicious food, inexpensive. Yummy chicken wings and coconut chicken,  good beef and broccoli with the broccoli cooked just right. They even have duck sauce."}
{"text":"Price is cheap but still not worth it. Food trays' expiration times were labeled 3pm. It was 4:30. Food was dried out and in some cases undercooked. Everyone in our party suffered gastric distress with an hour of eating there...even though we didn't eat much. (I would have left immediately but members of our party wanted the \"cheap-fast\" route because the children were hungry.) The table was caked with food sauce and other unrecognizable clumps of goo...disgusting!"}
{"text":"the price is undefeated. it is your usual walk in chinese place. don't expect any high quality interior.   now for the food selection, it is your standard chinese buffet. i personally am very selective in my eating and only had cooked shrimp, fried shrimp covered in flour and breadcrumbs, beef broccoli, and fried chicken wings. the red wings that almost all chinese buffets have.  now let me tell u that beff broccoli was some of the best i tasted. for pretty much $10 that beef broccoli cant really be beat. the meat was tender and the sauce delicious.   everything else tasted standard but that is not a bad thing. i pooed after this and it was not diareah so this is already a great sign.   so why not 5 stars? no crab legs! crab legs are a MUST and worth it even if it increases prices. again u get ur VALUE's worth and some if u just want a cheap eat and a buffet"}
{"text":"This place is real good now! Used to be bland and greasy, guess they did some improvements! Everything is very good, not racist at all. Some places in China Town are not very friendly with people not they're race? Great service, fresh food. Very tasty. This is my go to, the other China Star locations are eh eh/kind of okay! This ones got it going.  Very clean..even the restrooms are clean. Good management and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended I give China Star a try, and after hearing how authentic it was, I was really excited.  I am the last person who could tell you whether Chinese food is authentic or not...I judge Chinese food by whether it is gross, greasy and wilted, vs. fresh, tasty and well seasoned.  I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered an Egg Roll and Home Style Tofu.    The Egg Roll arrived first.  I can honestly say that this is the first time that I have eaten one that didn't seem like it was prepackaged.  The cabbage was fresh, and the bites of meat quality.  The Home Style Tofu arrived about 5 mins later and was a good size serving.  The tofu was sauteed and slightly crisp on the outside, and tender in the middle.  The black mushrooms and snow peas were done just right.  I also liked the spicy brown sauce it was served with, on my rice.  I didn't even have to add soy sauce.  The service was good, but one thing really stood out to me during my visit.  I had arrived quite late, probably only about an hour and 15 mins before closing.  As my dinner was wrapping up, all of the employees pulled up chairs around a table towards the back of the dining area, and started eating dinner together, laughing, and having what seemed to be an enjoyable time.  They all took turns serving the remaining tables.  The owner came over to ask how the food was, and we engaged him in brief conversation.  I know that might turn some people off, but it really left me with a nice impression on the way out the door.    My takeaway:  If the employees eat the food, then its good enough for me.  Well done, I will be back."}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered from this China Star online thinking that it was the one up in Squirrel Hill.  Huge difference.  No flavor at all!  The fried rice doesn't have anything in it except rice in some kind of bland brown sauce, no sprouts, no egg, nothing.  I truly have never tasted something that I would describe as cardboard until I bit into a spring roll.  My eggplant tasted like  nothing, not even eggplant!  I absolutely do not know how a restaurant can make food that is WORSE than what you would microwave out of the cheap frozen section of the grocery store!  Steer clear of this place!  No taste whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Was craving some shrimp fried rice on the to Cleveland. This place is nestled in a strip mall and seemed clean enough to take a chance. Overall, prices were very cheap for shrimp fried rice with a quart being about $7. I guess that cheapness reflects the taste. Pretty flavorless overall and very few shrimp to enjoy"}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch/dinner when i do shopping in ross park mall. Otherwise it would be too far away.  This restaurant is the best authentic szechuan restaurant in pittsburgh. The boss is talkative and nice. (He is always in his restaurant) Group-friendly round tables and comfortable square tables are all available."}
{"text":"if i could give this place no stars i would i served myself and here comes a cockroach out my plate !!! so please save your time and money do not do not bother coming here i was disgusted and disappointed they still came and doubted what i said so we all just walked out we were a decent sized party so sucks that theyve lost our business"}
{"text":"Positively, absolutely terrible food!  My husband and I were sick for several days after eating there.  Bathrooms were horrible, floors dirty, and employees very unfriendly!  Unless you are in the mood to lose a little weight the hard way, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the green vegetable entree and it was very bland. The broccoli seemed less than fresh and the asparagus was woody. This used to be my go to place for Chinese but I haven't ordered in a while and I won't be ordering again. The delivery driver also refused to leave me a receipt."}
{"text":"Great food, good price, nice people. Got general Tsp chicken was great super polite people."}
{"text":"It was surprising good! $6.49 lunch buffet, I really enjoyed everything. The service was very good too. I will be back many times"}
{"text":"Well we went here instead of sunset station buffet. The dinner price went up to 12 dollars. And I remember this place being packed even with the casino buffet across the street. Well the quality of the food is ok. It used to be better. The sushi was fresh. Didn't have Mongolian off the grill this time but previous visits it was good. I guess it's called lucky star out front but Yelp pulls up China star buffet. The ice cream machine was out of order. The fried rice and chow mein was on Saran wrap in the hot tray. The chicken skewers were decent. Same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken. Nothing stood out and was memorable. The donuts had been out forever and were hard as a rock. I'm surprised its still hanging on. I'd pass on this one."}
{"text":"I really like going to this place whenever I go I always have Raymond as my server he's really nice he always make sure my drink is full and keeps my table cleaned off of dirty dishes and that for me is a nice plus"}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order for chicken and broccoli dinner special over the phone. The lady was very polite and pleasant. The food was prepared fast and it was tasty. Would recommend for fast food."}
{"text":"This is a local restaurant for locals, but it lacks in hygiene the sneeze guards are very filthy. And some of the plates and forks are dirty as well. I suspect the food has alot of Msg, since it leaves a gross feeling afterwards.   The staff is also a little brittle and cold, and they don't refill drinks. Sometimes very brusque and almost rude attitude.  The food is on the okay side, it's either good or really bad. My personal favorite that is always a hit it's the shrimp and mushroom stir fry. Other than that it's either good or gross."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Yes. Really. I think. First order, I liked it. Second one, I likes. I wanted to taste their food again. Third order. I want Dragon Phoenix. Forth order.  At this point. I think I am settling in with this place for Chinese delivery.  The only two I've tried is Dragon Phoenix and General Tso's chicken. I like them both. The best General Tso's in Pittsburgh so far.  Update: I don't like them as much as I did before."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese spot, not the best but not the worst. I've had better experiences. This place just gets the job done."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Our waitress never came back throughout our whole meal to refill our drinks so we sat with empty cups through the last half of the time. Before leaving i went to use the mens restroom and was immediately repulsed. It appeared uncleaned for days. Trash was overflowing, the toilets were covered in waste, there was graffitti everywhere and the stalls were half ripped out of the wall. My girlfriend said the womens bathroom was spotless. We will never return to this location which sucks as we live right around the corner.  If the bathrom is that filthy how clean is the food and kitchen? Get it together china star. Massive fail."}
{"text":"Love this location. The food is always amazing. The employees are nice. But their bathrooms aren't kept very clean."}
{"text":"China Star is a little restaurant with a big history, having cycled through at least two names and two addresses. In terms of cuisine, it's adequate, though not outstanding. The Mongolian beef was pleasantly spicy, as were several of the other dishes. The veggies pretty clearly came out of a bag in the freezer, which was disappointing. The service was great. All things considered, I'd go back if I happened to be in the neighborhood, but probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Nicest staff and good food. Always go in for lunch because you can't beat the price. We like the coconut chicken and egg rolls which aren't always available for dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great and cheap and the service was quick. I would definitely recommend the place for delivery over carry-out or dine-in. It's not in the best of neighborhoods and there's only two tables inside. Other than that, it's everything you could want from Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is the last time I will order from here...ever!  Tonight my husband and I ordered dinner from here.  We proceeded to begin eating at which time I found a crispy fried fly in my rice.  We called the restaurant and asked them to come and get the uneaten food and to refund our money because we were not going to be eating it.  At this point a man came with a flashlight and began going through the food on our porch, would not leave, and did not give us our refund.  He did not leave until I threatened to call the police.  we called the restaurant again at which point they informed us that he was the manager.  Never Again"}
{"text":"Definitely a diamond in the rough. Or maybe a lab created diamond. :/  The restaurant itself is a creature of its surroundings. When we drove up, we thought it was closed! The front door had a wood panel covering up a glass panel that was broken. The windows were dirty and needed to be wiped down. Its appears to be one of the original buildings in the strip mall.  The staff was efficient and courteous. More than any other Chinese restaurants in the city. They filled the drink cups quickly. Cleared dirty dishes quickly. Plates and Bowls were well stocked.   As for the food. It was edible. We didn't get sick. I had salt and pepper crab, steamed mussels and clams, teriyaki chicken, chicken wings, watermelon, cookies, fried bananas... And I can go on and on.   For the price and location, this works."}
{"text":"Another unusually decent Chinese buffet...specially for the price...sure its not Caesars Palace and its a bit run down but the food is good and most of it is fresh and not dry, what else do you want for the $?"}
{"text":"Came to this place a few weeks back and had the worst experience of my life. To start of the service was horrendous, the sanitation issues in both the buffet line and the bathrooms was just ridiculous. The food is a culinary disaster, I mean I know it's nothing expensive or wonderful but for the same prices I could of gone somewhere way better. I was so stomach sick that I had to be placed on IV due to severe dehydration from the amount of things that came out of both ends of my body. And to just top it off, my debit card was copied from one of the employees and my account got robbed. Someone decided to go on a shopping spree and take $300 out of there. Luckily my bank notified me of an odd transaction, so both the health department and a police report has been filled for this horrible place. If you value your health and money please don't come to this place. I rather go hungry than come to this place.   Ps management does not care about your complaints"}
{"text":"Don't even know hot to start,me and my wife used to order from this place many times,as usual I got Mei fun with vegetables and my wife duck with vegetables all was take out,when I got home with order there was no duck in duck with vegetables dish,only chicken beef and duck skin on top to cover it,which is just ridiculous we came back to the restaurant and explained everything to cashier which seemed to understand but then this crazy woman came from the back and start yelling at us that we took this food home ate all the duck and brought the skin back,this is just so crazy I would not recommend anyone to go only if you want to fight over some stupid shit with old crazy lady,I will never go there again and tell my friend and everyone I know to do the same."}
{"text":"we went pretty late, but come on it was right on the strip over half the food was gone..empty trays, not being refilled what was there was from like 53 BC and starting to crust over asked waitress 3 times for a refill of my drink and she said okay  3 times but just continued talking to another waiter, never even got  it, i had to get up and go to the front counter and ask someone to do it myself....waitress was seriously wow. chop sticks? not a chance  i'm an easy rater on here, and i like cheap buffets but this shit was WACK"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on Grub hub and the store charged me tip, tax, and delivery online and then charged them again once again when the person delivered arrived. So I paid an extra $5. The food was also very oily, unhealthy and bland in flavor. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I am surprised that China Star only has three stars for its rating! It's our favorite inexpensive Chinese food place near Central Pittsburgh. I do mainly judge a Chinese place by their hot and sour soup, and there's is terrific. But their chicken and eggplant is also great and we generally find that we enjoy other things we get. Plus, delivery is always friendly and convenient."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the place needs a remodel. It's old & dirty. While I was attempting to have a relaxing dinner the staff was FIGHTING LOUDLY & would not stop. I had enough & walked out. VERY unprofessional. I WILL NOT go back."}
