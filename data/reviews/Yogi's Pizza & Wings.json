{"text":"I was skeptical when my cousin's suggested we try this place, because before opening as Yogi's, the location was previously home to two failed pizza joints.  I know there are several other pizza places in the area, but Yogi's is just so much better.  If you prefer eating cardboard texture pizza or sloppy greasy messes that make you feel sick to your stomach, go ahead and try those other joints.  Yogi's pizza was just so flavourful and I kept trying to eat more even though I was stuffed.  And the wings are very large well-cooked pieces, and the place does not skimp on the sauce. Just be warned, when this place labels something 'spicy' or 'hot', they mean it.  I can handle it but my cousin's were sweating bullets and gulping drinks.  Great spot.  Wish I'd known about it sooner."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Although I didn't have any of their pizza or wings, I am basing my review on the Mutton Poutine. This poutine along goes to show that the quality of the food provided here is top notch! 

I was recommended to come here by a few of my co-workers whom are Tamil, I was a little skeptical at first because I never had Tamil-style curry or Tamil food for that matter. (Other than samosas LOL). I'm glad I did come though! The poutine was lit. A small is $8 and a large is $10, for the extra $2 the size difference is a big difference. I would recommend the large. Comes with a generous serving of spicy mutton (I got mild but still broke a sweat) curry, fries and cheese. I enjoyed every bite but by the end I was ready to home and pass out. 4.5/5

The service was quick and its transparent that the owners appreciate all the business they get as their customer service is on point. 4.5/5

The environment was just average pizza joint-like but who cares about that when the food is soooo good! 3/5 

A fair warning I'm going to give is if you're not used to very spiced food such as Tamil cuisine you're going to have a bad time in the washroom. Btw they don't have a customer washroom so make sure you can make it home!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian and a pepperoni slice from them. Even after them putting it in the heating for a while, the dough felt really raw and since the sauce was over the raw dough, it literally felt like I was eating vomit. It was really gross, i threw the pizza out and didnt eat another bite.  The quality was not good and it is definitely not worth purchasing again."}
{"text":"100% halal, they say. 

Good food. Reasonable price except up-charges.

We ordered a pizza, wings, and mutton poutine.

To add an extra six wings on to the 12-wing deal, they charged us $5. They should round it up to 20 for $5 extra *smh. 

The wings are not that big. Double-Double on Rylander gives you bigger wings and its halaal there too.

Just to have half of the Wings in one sauce and the other half in another, they charged us an extra $2 which I thought was an unnecessary rip-off. It's not costing them any extra money to do this, so it's a shameless money grab in my opinion.

The large mutton poutine was $10 and could be shared by at least four people. Mutton poutine is made with some kind of Sri Lankan spices which I didn't particularly like. My family liked it though. Just know if you get it, it's going to have like Indian type spices in it. It was a little bit on the spicy side.

OH AND THE MILD BBQ WINGS WERE INCREDIBLY SPICY!!! SO SPICY THAT I STARTED COUGHING when I took a bite. 

No issues with the pizza  dough as the other reviewer noted. My family liked the pizza.

Overall, I would return for a pizza and BBQ wings.

They take Visa, MasterCard, debit and cash."}
{"text":"Mutton Poutine is definitely a must try! Spicy and delicious and flavourful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What to try: chicken wings.

What to avoid: pizza.

Ordered 10 chicken wings but ended up with maybe 12-15. No complaints here. Chicken \"wings\" were all variable size/shape. Some were simply sections of a single wing. Ordered honey garlic but was given BBQ. However the wings were crisp and not over sauced.

Pizza's crust is light but has a undercooked taste. Pepperoni slices are too large and thick; undercooked after a single pass through the oven."}
