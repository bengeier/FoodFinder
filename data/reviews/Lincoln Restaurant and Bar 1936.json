{"text":"We came here often when it was BLT...and we ate here in December (2016) for the first time since the transition. It was delicious! Sadly, a lot of the reviews on Open Table are negative. Don't let the negative reviews sway your decision-making. This place is worth checking out! The staff is attentive and friendly, the location is (still) beautiful. The food was wonderful! The shishito peppers are fantastic. The filet mignon is so tender and not over-seasoned. It's simple and good. They brought us little loafs of cornbread to start...and we were not charged for them (as some reviewers have suggested they were charged for bread). Like a friendly neighbor who moves away, we were sad to bid adieu to BLT...but there's a new neighbor now in Lincoln 1936, and we're looking forward to getting to know this restaurant better! Ps: the wine list is still amazing. :)"}
{"text":"First time having a Girls Night at Bar 1936.  Such a great idea! I can't believe it took us so long to try it. I love the ambiance and look of the new restaurant, Lincoln.  We just came for a few drinks, but we wound up ordering this amazing Seafood Tower and some champagne! I still can't believe it was only $85 for all of this seafood.  I'm completely stuffed!  This is a definitely a little known gem in the valley, but it shouldn't be... we will definitely be coming for dinner sometime very soon!!"}
{"text":"We were thrilled with this restaurant!  Nick made sure our experience was perfect from start to finish.  We had our daughter's wedding dinner here.  The food was fabulous and the staff made the celebration complete!  Katie Mae coordinated the wedding cake with the chef and it was superb...strawberry pistachio!! In fact we returned two nights later for Thanksgiving dinner!  They remembered us and celebrated the couple again with champagne!  That is a class act!  Thank you Lincoln Restaurant for the memories!"}
{"text":"I was with a party for 4. We were expecting a treat. The food was good, but that is only part of the dining experience. The service was terrible, just finding our server was difficult.The time from ordering to bringing to the table was inordinately long, even drinks and appetizers. The decor is cold with no noise absorbing features. The restaurant is like dining in a gymnasium. For the price of the dinners and the reputation of the resort, I expected a much finer experience. Save your money."}
{"text":"Hi my never-ending quest to find the best steakhouse in Phoenix Lincoln unfortunately wasn't one of them not even in the top 5 I do have to say it does have the best views of Camelback Mountain even though there was many tables open outside and not the windows they stuck this in the very back corner I guess they ain't like how I was dressed now for the food the popovers were pretty good that was pretty cool I haven't seen those in a long time start off with the shrimp cocktail love the size of the shrimp and the cocktail sauce was pretty good A little spicy like I like it now I have the steak which I didn't care for unfortunately it was like really chard and one side and not on the other cooked a little too much but that's okay didn't like the seasoning on it or lack of not sure which and their smashed potato was not at all was expecting it was just a baked potato push down put cheese on it she just got to the house the brussel sprouts were horrible not sure what can I say to you but he put on it but made my stomach and my wife stomach hurt and have weird aftertaste I said was okay but not what you expect from fine dining"}
{"text":"Meh. This was not the place to drop $250. We should've gotten an Uber off the property. (Staying here at hotel.) Mediocre at best. OK food. Strange atmosphere. Staff seemed disorganized and waitress was irritating. We won't be coming back again. You can't charge these kinds of prices and still make us feel like we're eating at an average hotel restaurant. (Oh and please get rid of the cheap office binders from Staples that house your upscale wine and cocktail list. Invest in some nice folders or something to hand to your guests dropping money on wine. Seriously. Let's get professional.)"}
{"text":"Chef Neff and Chef Millest have a winner in this location. Amazing food with subtle twists. We had the black cod that was by far one of the best pieces of seafood I have had in years, in the desert no less. I have had 4 different meals here and can say without a doubt this is going to be one of the new hot spots for food in the valley. I also appreciate the creative cocktail menu without breaking the bank. The yorkies are light and delicious as well as the fried chicken which has some deep roots in the south for sure. For me this is rare as I am not a sweets person but their desserts are beautiful and tasty. Side note the beef cheeks are amazing but super rich, do not be like me and order them for just yourself. I filled up on them and could not eat all of my perfectly cooked Ribeye and creamed street corn."}
{"text":"We were guests at the hotel and had just checked in. Around 6 PM.  We were referred to the bar for Happy Hour by another guest. Service was excellent.  We were waited on immediately and our 3 appetizers arrive quickly.   The food was not all that great, just ok.    Again great service! Our bartender recommend a couple of local places that he liked.    We would go back again for drinks."}
{"text":"What a treat for our Christmas Eve dinner!! The food was out of this world as well as the service. Everyone was in a festive and fun mood for the holiday. Serving sizes were just right and the menu selections offered the perfect variety to choose from. Bartender made our drinks perfectly as well. Yummy gluten free options. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant in The Camelback Inn. The service was ok, but not great. (I have to mention that we were there on Thanksgiving night and it was very busy. )Our steaks were good, done properly, tasty and crisp on the outside. The baked potato was excellent as well as the mushrooms. The crab cake and tuna tartare appetizers were also very good. All in all a pleasant experience, but not top notch."}
{"text":"Not the first steak house that one thinks of but still a very pleasant experience  We were four couples; nicely seated in a large corner table where we could converse and actually hear each other   We mostly had steaks; my Kansas City slab of beef was perfectly medium rare - and so large that half of it came home. Sides are adequate for sharing and served so they can be easily shared. Desert - of course - for sharing. The service was good; a little slow st times - but they definitely did not rush us. 
M and I plan to return during the day to enjoy the grounds - Marriott maintains that property beautifully."}
{"text":"Views of Camelback and visions of surf n turf.

It's steak and seafood all the way. I'm not even sure if there is chicken on the menu! But why search when what they do well is at hand?! Try the crab cakes, they are plump and delicious. We shared the hanger steak because we are cheep... and this restaurant is not!!

Expensive, but lovely. The service was friendly and knew the menu. 

The only regret was loading up on desert... didn't need the second scoop of ice-cream! But hey, big desert portions isn't a bad thing!

Sit outside under the lights, because we have all sat in a dark room to eat expensive steak before."}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks this week to check out what had taken over the BLT Steak space.  Honestly, we were underwhelmed by the new restaurant and bar...seems just like another hotel restaurant that doesn't have anything special to offer.  We both ordered glasses of wine and when we received the bill we were drastically overcharged and luckily caught it.  My wine was $9 and it rang up as $15 and my husband's wine was $10 and it rang up as $17...seems like a scam to me!  The bartender was very nice about it when we brought it to her attention and she made it right, but I wonder how many other people weren't as lucky."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse ever! The char on my perfectly cooked steak was phenomenal! The asparagus was sweet and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with friends. The food was good but portions were very skimpy. The filet consisted of 2 slices of beef. The menu said it came with potato purée and  brussel sprouts.  The purée wasn't even a spoonful. The brussel sprout leaves weren't t equivalent to one sprout.  If you want a meal consider the entrees and order a la carte.  There are much better restaurants in the city than this one.  I was disappointed as we just had a wedding at this hotel in February and the food and service then were exemplary."}
{"text":"Our family got the seafood tower....it really wasn't very good. The meatball appetizer just plain sucked. I'd give this place one or two stars, but the waiter was really good. They just need to up their food game."}
{"text":"Five stars for my drink, and one for the food equals a 3.  Came in here around 8pm on a Monday just as they were closing.  This used to be BLT steak and I had not been back since the changeover.  I was staying at the hotel and saw they had some interesting drinks, so stopped in for a drink and snack before dinner.  

I ordered a Sazerac, which was done right, and was perfect.

I also had some \"fried\" cauliflower to munch on.  Fried or not (don't think it was) it was soft and mushy, not crisp.  It was supposedly served with \"smoked yogurt sauce.\"  It was served with plain yogurt--very boring.  The entire dish was boring, aside from a couple of house-made pickle chips that were served alongside as a garnish.  This was kind of a test, if the appetizer was good, I was going to order more food.  Of course, I didn't.  I'm just amazed time and again at expensive restaurants some of the stuff they serve to people.  Does anyone taste this stuff?

Also really liked the interior at BLT--not sure why they redid the interior.  It has a cheap-modern, almost temporary feel to it.

Anyway, won't be back, and agree with other reviews it's subpar."}
{"text":"We are just leaving the restaurant. We had great service by Katie. The service and food were outstanding.  The drinks and appetizers she picked were all so great."}
{"text":"Lincoln went into the spot that BLT used to be in at the Camelback Inn.  I headed over one night last weekend to check it out along with my husband and another couple, and we sat outside on the patio for appetizers and drinks.  We were pretty underwhelmed with the entire experience, and ended up heading elsewhere for entrees and dessert as a result.

Of the things we tried, I liked the cauliflower appetizer best.  Service was decent, and the Chef came out to greet us, but nothing else was super memorable aside from my glass of Bella Glos and the company.  The restaurant still serves popovers upon request (which was one of the things that BLT was known for), and we had some, but they didn't taste quite as amazing as we remembered, so not sure if perhaps they changed the recipe?!

Lincoln is on the pricey side, and I'm sure it's a perfectly fine option for a meal for hotel guests, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. You think with the prices they charge they should be able to cook your steak right, WRONG!"}
{"text":"Great variety of options! The kitchen is very accommodating. The butternut squash filet with chimcurie was delightful! My husband and I split the wedge salad, perfect to share. My husband had the 18 hour cooked  short ribs, it melted off the bone and very tasty. Highly recommend this restaurant to all in the area. David our server was pleasant, engaged and helpful. We finished the night off with the German chocolate cake! Right portion, moist and  perfect!"}
{"text":"We love the updated menu at the Lincoln.   It is back to comparable food to the BLT.   As always Sam took care of us and even remembered our favorite foods.    She is personable and makes recommendations and if you do not like something - they are always willing to take feedback.   The view outside is fabulous in the cooler weather.   We had happy hour and then ate.   Easy transition from the bar to our table.   Love the people atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. We had the Dover Sole, Short Rib Stroganoff and Flat Iron Steak. For sides, the Creamed Spinach, Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes AuGratin. Everything tasted great and exceeded our expectations. The service was outstanding and attentive. 
This is the place to go for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Went for their new menu launch.  
Drinks - superb has Manhattan and cowboy killer both excellent and down to $8 for HH for next time
Food - seafood tower, KC strip and short rib.  Steak could have used some more seasoning but can't fault the quality.  Largest and best tasting short rib we've ever had. Desserts were excellent as well
Service - busy night, but the service was great.  Ask for Matt.

We'll be back, good luck on the new menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a meal at this restaurant recently and was very pleased. They also have a nice kids menu if you need one. Beautiful decor, prompt service and on beautiful grounds. Enjoy an after dinner cocktail at the bar or outside by the fire enjoying the gorgeous mountain views."}
{"text":"Review based just on drinks.....Do yourself a favor and go to Rita's for a cocktail....you would think given the bar 1936 name they would have an amazing bartender.....not the case"}
{"text":"We used to go to BLT, but after having a few BAD experiences there, we were happy to see a new replacement. We were staying at the JW Marriott Camelback for our \"staycation\" 28th anniversary and had made anniversary dinner reservations else where, but were enticed to try the Lincoln instead. We had made reservation on Open Table on a Saturday for 2 at 7:00 p.m. and stating that we were celebrating an Anniversary.

When we arrived the restaurant was fairly empty considering it was a Saturday night. When asked if we wanted to sit outside or in, we choice outside. We asked if we could sit at an outer table that was getting cleared off for us. Apparently the couple was not finished and they came back for there dessert. The Manager came over to apologize, so I asked for a round of comped drinks for my inconvenience. Service was good. We ordered cocktails while perusing the new menu. My Cosmopolitan needed a lot of work and at that price, a bar tender should know how to make a perfect Cosmo. We ordered the Gem Caesar Salad (White Anchovy / Arizona Cheddar / Roasted Garlic Dressing), Seared Divers Scallops (Tepary Bean Ragout / Brussels Sprouts / Speck Ham Crisp) and the USDA Prime Bone-in Ribeye (30-Day Dry-Aged Ribeye / Crispy Potato Shishito Pepper / Bone Marrow Butter).

My Cosmo. cocktail needed a lot of work. The Brioche was excellent but I miss the popovers. The Caesar Salad was OK, the Cheddar which replaced traditional Parmesan Cheese was lacking a bite along with the missing lemon juice which would of added a nice tang. The Scallops were very good. The steak was done perfectly, looked great, but lacked taste. I was also disappointed that not an Anniversary dessert was given to us, considering we had started it to our hostess and on the reservations.

Great Atmosphere, convenient if you don't want to leave the resort. Service good, food OK, frankly we should of stayed with our original restaurant  reservation choice: Elements restaurant at the Sanctuary Camelback."}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews are so bad... their happy hour is epic (wings, shishito peppers and truffle fries are on point) and their whiskey and scotch selection is pro. The servers are super attentive. My ribeye was cooked to perfection and my husbands salmon was almost enviable. Great starters, sides wine list... I don't know what ppl are looking for but the Lincoln is a winner in my eyes."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last week with a friend. The service was outstanding and is some of the best service we have ever had anywhere. The food was ok, but very overpriced for what it was. It was what I would expect out of any bar and grill type restaurant, but with 4 star prices. I mean potato wedges for $9, I can get some just as tasty from KFC for $1. The $16 burger with what is supposed to be bacon jam, I have had equally good burgers at Red Robin that comes with fries. Don't get me wrong the food did not taste bad or even come out bad, it just wasn't wow and for the prices the food and the menu options need to be be totally revamped. The absolute best thing we had was the desert and they were elegant and very tasty. The deserts were the only thing that were worth the price."}
{"text":"Talk about a disappointment in dinner dining. Bar was packed with happy hour. No separation from restaurant and lousy acoustics to boot. Struggle for 4 of us to hear each other until bar wound down. Service a bit spotty, not sharply done and they were 80% empty at 6pm. Nice server though. Setting sun through windows even with light shades not good. One of our $50+ steaks was well past the ordered medium. Sides were set in the middle of table with no serving spoons. We asked and they said use your teaspoons. We told them that's a poor answer and said they don't have serving spoons. Came back with a soup spoon. When your spending $300 on dinner you can find a wealth of local restaurants that are head and shoulders better. And if you look at my overall reviews you see I usually am not a negative guy."}
{"text":"Lincoln's Restaurant replaced one of my favorites BLT and it did not disappoint. Stopped in for Happy Hour, the bacon wrapped meatball with cheese was fabulous. The wine selection was very good. The staff was very informative when asked about the menu. The property is beautiful and you can't beat the view."}
{"text":"Came here with a rather large group for dinner on a Sunday night. Everything started off pretty well, drinks all around. The waiter seemed eager to help and was super attentive in the beginning. 

We tried to be patient but we were left a LONG time without an order being taken. So much so, that I finally snagged a waiter and begged for bread. They offered me the $5 rolls that were in the appetizer menu, but when I just asked for regular table bread, the waiter came around with two Kings Hawaiian style rolls just for me. None for anyone else!! 

FINALLY our main order was taken. We waited over an hour for our food. It wasn't just the extraordinary wait, but it was the fact that our waiter completely abandoned us that left us feeling so hangry. Our wine glasses and water glasses were empty. We were hungry, thirsty, and angry... a lethal combination. Even more frustrating was that we were spending hundreds of dollars for this dinner between the wine and food, and no one seemed to care that we were even there. Multiple people from our party went up to the hostess stand to find out what was going on. 

Eventually, the food came and only then did the manager come out and \"apologize\". I feel strongly that it was not a genuine apology, but rather an outright \"there are no excuses, it was completely the kitchens fault.\"  Yikes. 

The food was fine. Not great. Not hot. I had the scallops. Meh. We were all just too famished to bother to complain. We'd be waiting another hour for the replacement! 

To make it up to us, they gave is a couple of bottles of wine on the house. Dessert was just ok too.. Maybe we were just too tired and upset to care at that point.

Will pass on giving this place another try the next time I'm in the area. It's really too bad!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing but I don't want anyone to know. I like coming here not needing reservations. Don't tell anybody, the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great place love Dave Kent! He made our experience awesome and this is why we came back a second time! True front of the house pro!"}
{"text":"What a great replacement for BLT steak that was there before.  Elegantly composed dishes, casual but refined service with stunning views of Camelback Mountain.  We had the chicken and dumpings, filet, scallops and they exceeded our expectations!  Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"the food is ok.  the service is very bad. had to ask for water,, ask for plates to be cleaned away.  and it was our anniversary manager kept walking by like we were  never there.  capital grill has nothing to worry about.
