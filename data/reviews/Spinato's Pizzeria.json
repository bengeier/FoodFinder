{"text":"Great food, horrible service.  For the 3rd time in 5 visits my pick up order was 10 minutes late.  No apologies no drink no discount t"}
{"text":"I had \"The Greek\" pizza, its delicious. Here on a Saturday night lots of people and great service. I find the brick ceiling to be interesting at the bar. Beer was priced good they don't have Bud light on draft which is my usual."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Maybe it was the fact that we didn't order pizza, but when your kids are disappointed-that's not good. Portions are extremely small.   Stick with the pizza because the kids meals are sized for four year olds. The kids ordered spaghetti and got less than a cup each. The waitress suggested we BUY another meal for them. The free scoop of gelato that came with the kids meal was smaller than the tablespoon they gave them to eat the dessert.   My wife and friends ordered the pizza which was ok. I ordered a cup of soup and sandwich because I'm a little tired of eating pizza every week. For nearly $4 I got a double shot of flavorless minestrone. The sandwich was good but not for the prices we paid.   The new location is nice. But the ambiance didn't make up for the portions, the wait, or the lackluster waitING staff and service."}
{"text":"I had been looking for this place for YEARS after my friend had taken me here. Finally my mom and I randomly came here and I realized it was the restaurant I had been trying to come back to for almost 5 years! Their pizzas and delicious, and well as their beef sandwiches. Love this place. No other pizza place is as good as Spinatos!"}
{"text":"Spinatos has one of the best Pizzas that my wife and I like in Scottsdale. The Vegetarian pizza as well as the Da Greek pizza are our favorites. Yesterday was my wife's birthday and the whole family had another wonderful experience celebrating at Spinatos! We highly recommend everyone giving Spinatos a try!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley. Get there early if you want a seat this place fills up fast."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. Unfortunately the pizza was awful. It was super soggy. I'm not sure if it was because there was a delay getting here but no one in our party could handle more than 2 small square slices. I don't think we will be ordering there again."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. We drive a ways to get here but loved it. They have gluten free pizza, too. The one up north has good food and service but not the expanded menu and new building and decor you find here."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza in Arizona! The sauce is sweet, the cheese is yummy, and they have the BEST thin crust pizza!  The staff is super sweet. I would highly recommend coming here!!!  The staff is really sweet."}
{"text":"Came with the family. Had a great time. Food was ok. The marinara was sweet. The bread was good though. The caprese salad was good. They don't serve apple juice for the kids anymore. Gave them a bottle of fruit drink....10% juice ......"}
{"text":"Allyson was great. Food was very good and semi reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend going there"}
{"text":"- Wait staff more genuinely interested in us having a good meal that just about anywhere else I've ever been -Drinks came the moment they were low - Perfect level of affordability and class (Why yes, I would like a 22-inch \"Da Greek\" Pizza, please) - Great coffee; came with a frigggin biscotti like it's supposed to - Full dinner for four with booze and dessert for less than $100 plus tip -Volume level of music just high enough to let you know that you're supposed to have loud, raucous conversation - No age discrimination in the wait staff; spicy younger ones and older folks all working hard and having a good time doing it - got our order 100% right (no onions on one half, they even did a sauce lined down the middle to divide it properly) - Last but not least, the food itself was very, very good; and I'm from New York so I'm kind of a d*** when it comes to pizza  Seriously, the worst part of the meal here was that the wait staff couldn't have some."}
{"text":"I'm a little familiar with Spinato's as I've visited their Tempe location a few times. Pizza has always been great, so when Spinato's opened in Ahwatukee I couldn't wait to visit and try some of their other items.   I was pretty underwhelmed by the whole experience. Italian bread is $1.99 for something that really should be complimentary. I guess this is a sign of the times, though, so I wouldn't hold that against them if the bread was tasty. But unfortunately, it was nothing special, so please don't waste your money. There was zero flavor and nothing \"Italian\" about it.  I personally had basic spaghetti with marinara sauce. The sauce was good, but the portion was small for the price ($7.49). Again, not very surprising. What I was surprised about was the amount of time two simple plates of spaghetti took to come out. I'm usually not one to compare the speed of my food to others in the restaurant, because I know food takes different times to prepare and all, but I have do it this time. While we were waiting I had time to observe a table of five that were ordering at the table next to us. They spent quite some time giving all of their picky special requests, yet they still received their food before us. All of that before two simple plates of spaghetti?  I was very disappointed with the service we received. There were employees everywhere, and everyone was very pleasant, but I do feel like our server ignored us to pay more attention to the table next to us. I don't think it was a coincidence that this other table had four servings of alcohol. I guess he didn't want to waste time on us when he thought he'd be getting a bigger tip from them. Again, while waiting for our food I had time to look around and I saw another one of his tables (also without alcohol) being ignored as well. The only time he seemed to make us a priority was when a manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  Then he rushed right over to clear our plates and ask if we needed dessert.   I'll still give them another shot and pick up a pizza in the future, but I'll stay away from dining in."}
{"text":"The kid that took my order on the phone screwed it up so badly that it had to be remade.   30 minutes later, I walked away with a half baked, bad pizza.   The staff in the to go area is rude, and the hostess was talking loudly about her high school drama.   I'm shocked that it was so busy here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We Go here for lunch a couple of times a month.  Great pizza, Great Service, what more can you ask for!  Just wish i lived closer..."}
{"text":"OMG, I am totally in love with Spinato's Pizza. I went there for a colleague's birthday lunch and have fallen in love with their Italian food. I had the most amazing calzone which was stuffed with steak, peppers, spinach,  sweet peppers, ricotta and mozzarella.  It had a side of ajus sauce and their house made marinara sauce. I want to go back for happy hour and enjoy that calzone all over again but this time with one of the yummy beers that they have on tap. Also, the service was awesome although we were about 14 people deep!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love This Place!  The staff is super friendly and the pizza is awesome  ...just wear your loose pants because they're gonna stuff you!"}
{"text":"Well, had to try this pizza since everyone on here and ON DA STREET has been raving about it. I gotta say, the pizza's not living up to the cred; oh, it's pretty good, but it's good in the way Pepsi is \"better\" than Coke i.e. it has more sugar.  Yeah, so they do they sweet sauce gimmick. While it makes your mouth want more, in my case my head was asking why I was eating a pizza doused in ketchup. Okay, so it wasn't that bad (in fact it was highly tasty), but y'know. I just wonder how it would've tasted with normal sauce.  Anyway, what I really want to comment on here is the customer service: I was impressed! I like when I go to a place and you can tell the people really give a damn about your experience and aren't flashing the fake \"Scottsdale\" smiles that have been rigorously trained into them by some customer service guru or whoever it is who thinks anybody likes that junk. The guys there were all about my needs, cool, and didn't try upselling me a bunch of junk. Just a breath of fresh air in this (and really any) city.  I'm a big Chicago pizza guy, so maybe I'll give them another chance; next time with what I call the \"real\" Chicago pizza experience. (Stuffed pie)  BYE"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, wings, salads. Awesome Happy Hour Specials. Just wish they would drop the Candoni Pinot Noir, and bring back Schug Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"In the number of times we have been here, we have had a variety of food - from pizza to the fabulous meatballs to salads and the garlic cheese bread which is to die for - and EVERYthing has been absolutely top quality, extremely tasty, and the best Italian we have ever had in our 60+ years on earth!!!   The servers are great, and the place is comfortable.....yeah, not the biggest inside, but certainly adequate and you aren't on top of the next party.  We haven't ever had a problem with noise, even on a Friday after work!  LOVE IT!!!!  Oh yeah, and specials every day from 2-6!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite nearby places. I've gotten really fast delivery and they have gluten free options for everyone to enjoy. The staff has been generally friendly and addressed any questions/complaints quickly with appropriate response."}
{"text":"This location has terrible customer service the last 5+ times I've been here. I love their pizza but it is hard to continue to overlook the service. We called an order in a to go and  we ended up waiting an additional 45 mins over the hour we were told it would take to be ready. Nearly two hours for a pizza???? There was no compensation for the wait.  I would say it is mismanaged. I used to bring my small dog and sit with her on the patio at lunch but the last time I was here the manager was so rude when he came up to tell us that they were not a pet friendly patio. There were no signs. I thought he was kidding at first.  We got our order to go and the manager was just sitting at the bar enjoying his lunch. That does not look good to a customer. Employees should be a little more private about eating in front of customers.  This was the last straw combined with the poor customer service. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Q. How do you fix a broken pizza? A. With tomato paste!  Ok, that sucked.  Spin-at-O's pizza is actually how it's pronounced as the owner learned to make pizza in Baltimore MD home of the Orioles or O's for short. Ok, I just made ALL that stuff up but it would have been cool. Right?  Spinato\"s pizza and calzones are amazing. Very heavy and sauce rich. If you're on a diet STAY AWAY. If you're not calorie counting-COME HERE. Their thin pizza is very thin and very good! We got the baked spaghetti w/meatballs calzone and it was what you'd expect but wow was it great.   Only downside after eating here: FOOD COMA ZZZZZzzzzzzZzzzzz :)"}
{"text":"Ok so this place has the worst customer service and communication skills ever! I Had called in to Spinato's Pizza for a delivery and ordered a non-Gluten pizza which is really good tasting pizza My son has celiac. Anyhow, When I called in to order Sunday Night (6:05) and I specifically made sure I gave them the exact address so there wouldn't be any mix up because of the sense of urgency having dinner on time etc...  I called back (6:35)to see what the eta was on the pizza and asked for manager Jeff and he tells me that the pizza had not left yet because the driver had a question on my address  So I said ok put them on the phone or ask them what they need and I'll hold. He comes back to the phone and says \"Oh it must be all ok because the driver already left  \" Ummm so the pizza was there but then disappeared in 2 minutes..OK so obviously Jeff is NOT running a tight ship. So I proceeded to wait 45minutes now at this point I called again and Jeff answers the phone and tells me that the driver came back because they could not reach me on the phone and they had the wrong number? And didnt have an APT number. Ok first he tells me it hadn't left yet then within minutes he says it did Jeff has to get his story straight I made sure in the first call that they had my apt number so somebody over there is either getting things mixed up or lying. So I called on Tuesday July 17th and talked with Jennell Little GM manager and told her everything that had happened and she said she was informed about this by jeff already. I told her that I was not happy what so ever especially when at the last minute without notice I had to run to the store and get dinner for a hungry teenager since the pizza never showed up to my door.  Anyhow, Jennell was nice on the phone but not very helpful. She didn't even apologize She started to questioned me about my name and made it seem like it was my fault this happened. I gave her the benefit to fix it. So she proceeded to tell me she needed to talk with jeff again before making any decision and to call me back...Really? Why because you think Im lying about this whole thing, you don't think I have better things to do? I called the pizza shop 2 times after the order just to make sure this sort of thing wouldn't happen.. So why was I informed of some supposed wrong address and then it was correct anyway?? It looks like the customer in this case did the following up not Spinato's Pizza And not having my correct phone number and address in the system is not my doing its obviously the the girls who answer the phones,.,maybe there texting during work and getting confused IDK but its to weird. Also what's really weird is they ask for my last name when ordering the pizza. Really? Im not paying with a credit card or buying a car. Im just ordering a simple pizza or at least I thought I was anyway. Anyhow, Overall I never had a pizza delivered as promised and really, this pizza place needs to fix their customer service and give the customers the benefit of doubt because we are the ones paying for your rent,payroll, etc...I'm a former small business owner in the service industry and I can tell you that I had my employees worship my customers at all times! I would definitely caution everyone ordering a delivery from Spinato's Pizza you just might not get a pizza."}
{"text":"Spinato's has not typically been one of our regular stops for pizza in the past, but after our visit last night, it will definitely be our go-to place from now on, thanks to the unexpected superb customer service we received. My husband and I ordered dinner salads and one pizza to share. We enjoyed our salads, as they were sizable and very fresh! Then the pizza arrived, and alongside the waiter was the General Manager, Jenell. She explained that the pizza was not up to their usual standard, as it was lacking the correct amount of cheese, and to compensate for that, they would be providing us with another pizza to take home. We were floored and thanked her profusely! We ate our pizza that we ordered, which was truly delicious, and happily left with another one to freeze at home and enjoy at a later date. Thank you Jenell--you demonstrated such a high level of integrity and commitment to quality and customer satisfaction that we had never before experienced. You now have two new customers for life!"}
{"text":"Last minute dinner plans for 11 and Spinato's was the destination.. Greeted promptly and sat right away.. Mike our server was excellent! He was On top of all of our needs and the food was fantastic! In my group complaints about something is not unusual... Surprisingly everyone loved there food and was beyond stuffed! Was able to do separate checks and made it for a sick Monday night dinner! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Big mistake ordering delivery from this place and the pizza was not good. Costco or Pizza Heaven has better tasting pizza and for a whole lot less. Never again!"}
{"text":"If I were a tasting judge for the best pizza in town, this one would be one of my top picks. I've eaten pizza in New York, and Chicago. This pie, bar none, is up there with some of the best I've ever had.  This sauce! OMG, tastes like home. I've found my go to pizza place! Please go and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love this place but the first time I went my experience was HORRIBLE! The kids pizza took 1 hour, the food was cold my order was wrong twice and the manager had the nerve to think I was going to pay for food I didn't get to eat. This experience was when they first opened. Glad I went back because I had twins for waiters and they were awesome! Totally changed my view of Spinatos. The chicken Marsala is great, bread sticks are the best and the atmosphere is hip and trendy."}
{"text":"the best pizza in the valley, their sauce is epic, and the wait staff as well as management are awesome!"}
{"text":"Although they don't have the best food in town, it's not the worst by any means.  it seems to be a bit healthier of an option if you're REALLY needing pizza, too.  My vegetarian friend appreciated the veggie options here.  I will put this out there though... their breaksticks must be sprinkled with love (or crack) because when they're on the table, I just cannot control myself!"}
{"text":"Went into Spinato's because I heard it was started in Chicago and I was looking for a good place to go since I am from the greater Chicago area. Can without a doubt say I had an amazing experience! The pizza was to die for! The service exceeded my expectations! I learned a lot about the Spinato family and how it all got started. I also really liked the idea that it is still a family restaurant and they have decided to not join the corporate way. Loved Spinato's so much that I applied for a job!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a pizza lover. Aficionado is way too pretentious, but I enjoy sampling \"gourmet\" pizza as much as possible. I don't think Spinatos bills themselves in the gourmet category, but they should. The quality of ingredients is always top-shelf, their secret sauce is magical. They must purchase their sausage directly from Anteros, the Italian god of love and passion.  Our family always gets the same round (all personal sized, although my \"person\" ends up with a medium)...  - Mama Spinato's Signature (spinach, secret spices and LOTS of garlic) - The Chicago (Italian sausage, onions, peppers) - Good ole plain cheese (usually plus olives)  Sometimes, we'll go crazy and put some pepperoni in there somewhere.   DId you hear, they have a baked spaghetti calzone!! Yeah, it's crazy!  It's very good, but their pizza is just amazing, it's hard to jump off to try something different.  My wife turned me on to them back in 2007 and I've NEVER had anything better. She's been coming since they were partnered with Aurelio's way back in the day.  It's not the fastest pie in the West, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"When I moved into the neighborhood, one of my friends said I had to try Spinato's.  So I ordered a few pies for everyone who helped me move.  They are not near as cheap as fast food pizza joints, but it's worth the price.  While the crust is a little thicker and lacks the crispness of traditional Chicago thin crust, it is fantastic pizza! (For more traditional Chicago thin crust, try Johnnie's on Cave Creek)  Sauce is nice and sweet, and they have a large variety of fresh toppings.  This place gets busy most nights, and delivery can be an hour or longer during prime pizza hours, so plan ahead.  (I haven't had any calzone or pasta dishes, and always gotten delivery or pick-up)"}
{"text":"Just love this place. My family is hooked ;) Someone FINALLY brought Chicago to Arizona. Dream come true. Fabulous food!"}
{"text":"Spinato's catered our wedding, and we cannot express how wonderful it was.  Not only was the food ridiculous (one guest said he had 6 slices of pizza!) but the staff was just the best!  From the tasting to tearing down, they were great!  We even decided that is where we are going to have our anniversary dinner!!  :)"}
{"text":"If I could I would give Spinato's 10 stars! We love this place...basically we are addicted. I am in love with the Nicole's new favorite . The flavors are perfectly infused. The thing is the food is just the half of it. The service is amazing...it makes the dining experience perfect. We have been there about 6 times over the past 4 months and not once have had bad service.   Everyone is so friendly. Tonight we had a new waitress we had never had before. She suggested a wine that I fell in love with. Also the waiter we had the last time we were there stopped by said hi and made sure we were being taken care of. They really are great at what they do, Other restaurants need to take tips from them.  The food is so good you want to run in the kitchen and yell \"you guys are awesome.\""}
{"text":"This place has gotten better over time actually! Of course it us known for its pizzas and they became better, especially the crust. Pastas are good enough, and salads are clean and fresh. The red sauce, in fact, on the sweet side so you need to keep that in mind (you can try the pesto ones to stay away the sweetness, for example)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty, noisy though.  Bar area is nice.  Food was very good served very hot. But had to wait a ling time for drinks ( they weren't that busy to warrant that). Then after food was served had to wait for plates server forgot for eating Calzone. The servers were all very pleasant but inept. I ordered a pasta dish, $10.95.  I asked if it came with bread or salad, was told it did not that i would have to order bread separately, I did, and then when my pasta came it did include one piece of garlic toast. Spinatos has always had great pizza.  In the future I probably won't go to dine in, but just get take out pizza.  Then I don't have to tip for service I didn't get. I would just as soon go to Babbos for pasta and their unlimited yummy bread if I want to eat in."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The food was delicious. We were greeted promptly by the professionally polite hostess, Camden. The service was excellent, thank you Emerald. We will definitely return for sure."}
{"text":"We got one each of the thick crust and the thin crust. The thicker crust was very thick and bready not at all chewy, had way too much sauce and we counted 10 pepperonis on the entire large pizza. Also pepperonis were buried under everything so not crispy on the top. The sauce tasted like sugared tomato paste. The thin crust was very crackery, the toppings again were very sparse and the pizza overall was way too salty. Pizza was cold upon delivery but we are at the very end range of their delivery boundaries and it did come within the expected time. I don't think I would get this again. Friendly delivery and easy online ordering though."}
{"text":"Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach pizza = the best ever!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I just moved back to Arizona from New Mexico and was really excited to find a local pizza place. There is a perfect amount of garlic in their pizzas. Its just fantastic. I've never gotten a bad pizza ever.."}
{"text":"Great, fast service. The cheesy bread was perfect and the caesar salad is a must have with the crusty Parmesan. Had \"Nicole's new favorite\" and loved it. In and out in 45 minutes."}
{"text":"In search of The Valley's Best Calzone, my friends and I headed first to Spinato's. The bar is high for our \"Best\" being Ciro's in Mission Beach, CA. If I could give a !/2 star, I would give Spinato's a 4.5. My friends tried their calzones with pepperoni, and opted for the ricotta. I tried theirs and it was very good. The pepperoni was not quite as spicy or excellent as Ciro's, but still good. I opted for a meatball and jalepeno calzone with the ricotta. We all ordered an extra side of marinara as the calzones were not as \"saucy\" as we hoped. But all in all, very good! Great crust: not too overwhelming, the sauce was on the sweeter side but the jalepenos offset that sweetness on my varietal. Overall really tasty. We will go back to try the pizza but still in search of a Ciro's competitor. .... As my Grampa would say, \"Mangia, mangia\"!"}
{"text":"After having just taken a tour of Frank Lloyd Wright's summer home, Taliesin West, just down the street, we decided to stop by Spinato's for some pizza.  I was immediately surprised as I walked in the door... Chicago-themed posters and decorations everywhere! I turned to my brother and told him, \"Did I really just fly here from Chicago yesterday or am I still in Chicago?\" Apparently the family that started this chain is from Chicago.... nice.  So how does this place compare to actual pizza from Chicago? Well, first off, don't expect a deep dish or even a pan pizza, think more of a thin crust, party-cut (cut in squares) Chicago style, akin to Aurelio's. Well, that's what we got anyway. I think there is a thicker crust pizza as well.  Guess what? We got the \"Chicago\" pizza. It was really tasty! The crust was thin and crisp, the sauce was flavorful and somewhat sweet. Ingredients seemed to be decently fresh. I liked that they serve the pizza on a grate to keep the crust nice and crispy.  A great place to go for a little taste of some of Chicago!*   * The non-deep-dish variety of Chicago pizza"}
{"text":"Always good service, amazing pizzas with their sweet sauce and the Papago beer is a must!! The happy hour specials are definitely worth trying out. No complaints! :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza, different. We tried the Sicilian. Not like Sicilian I'm used to from back east ( it was round for one thing ) but we liked it. I'm not giving 5 stars because the service was not great. They seemed confused. Told us 45 minutes to pick up. Then when we got there they said another hour. Then oops no that was wrong it will be ready in 15. Should have been ready when we got there . Ended up waiting another 1/2 hour. Then they tried to give us someone else's pie. They need help or better trained staff."}
{"text":"My Brother and I went and ate here for lunch, the server was nice. But the food was very plain and had an awful flavor. We both got a different pastas but we only sent back one becasue we didnt want to look ungrateful. The sausage in the pasta was very good, same with hibiscus tea. My brother ordered a blue moon but it was flat, that was a little dissappointing as well."}
{"text":"I love the ravioli at Spinato's, the portion is amazing and the gluten free pizza is good."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found. Their sauce and chocolate chip cookies are incredible. The cookies have like six ingredients. Good quality, for sure."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed at this restaurant and want to show in detail why. I went there today around 2 pm and place looks great, has good environment. I ordered Mama Spinato's Signature Spinach Pizza that turned out to have more garlic than any other ingredient even though it looked great, I had to send it back the flavor was overwhelming. My husband lemonade that was super concentrated, we had to water it with other two glasses of plain water to be drinkable, and he also ordered Cajun Chicken Pasta which had too much oil and look like soup instead of pasta and was bland. Hanna, the waitress was exceptional in trying to make us feel comfortable but after speaking with the manager and ordering another calzone, we get the bill and we get charge $6 dollars more than original price. My husband and I, of course will never go back there, since the waitress seemed to be the only one who know how to do her job. I would not recommend this place at the moment for food, but I recognized it has all the potential to do much better."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times already and will continue to do so! Delicious pizza and good service every time so far. Can't go wrong with the Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach specialty pizza. We always order this every time we're here."}
{"text":"Really good food and great friendly Italian atmosphere. Very family friendly. In particular their pizza as fantastic. The scratch made sauce really makes it."}
{"text":"We love Spinatos! We have been to the Tempe, Scottsdale, and their previous Phoenix location before they relocated. We picked up a pizza to go tonight and it was as good as always. Their new location is beautiful and they were packed!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always good. Ive never had a bad pizza here. The meatball appetizer is delish and now that i know they serve Angry Orchard cider. This IS the PIZZA joint. The Gelato is always good on the way out too. Today, I'm just full and content with my drink and great pizza."}
{"text":"Some people like dessert with their meal. The marinara and pizza sauces (if they're not the same) at Spinatos have enough sugar in them to give you cavities after one meal. The environment was appealing but loud, until about 7:30 pm on the Saturday we went - looks like they mainly appeal to the early diners with a sweet tooth... Seriously, for good, soul comforting and Savory pizza go to Bianco, The Parlor, Oreganos, Grimaldi's, or even Ray's."}
{"text":"Always nice to come here after a long day of work.  The staff is friendly.  Wednesday's it's half off bottle of wine.  So,  that is a plus :).  I always enjoy a nice glass of wine with a salad and their trio meatballs.  Great place to come relax and sit at the bar.  The thin crust pizza great also."}
{"text":"Way over-rated.  This location used to be good.  Now its a gamble on what you get.  The Chicago Steak calzone lacks the key ingredient....STEAK.  For a small its a little over over 12.00 there should be an even amount of steak throughout the calzone not a thin layer in the middle and a bunch of veggies."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Arizona. Love the fresh ingredients. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Spinatos is awesome. I don't know this place slipped under my radar for so long. It's been here since the 80's. Went here for lunch 2 weeks ago and plan on making it a weekly habit since.  I went with 2 coworkers last time and we split a Chicago pizza, excellent, and less than $7 each with tip... Previous time to that was a spinach topped mini pie that hooked me.   So hungry now and it's almost lunch time, maybe we should make it a 2 times per week minimum stop."}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza in Phoenix! There is also one by Tempe Market place. Our favorite is the Homade Italian Sausage and Peperoni pizza!   When the Tempe location first opened it was like a hidden gem that no one knew about. Now the wait can be any where from 15 to 45 minutes! The deliver around the mall and you can always call in and pick up! The awesome thing is they know your name when you call in and they keep track of what you have ordered in the past!  BEST PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago-style thin crust pizza with the best pizza sauce in town--just the right hint of sweetness. Decent salads too. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Can't ask for much more from a neighborhood pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Beware when ordering online. I had placed an order through their app yesterday for a pizza and garlic bread. The store called back quickly to explain they did not have garlic bread available.  I told them the pizza would do and waited for my order. So when the driver arrived and my delivery fee had gone from 3.00 to 6.00 for a 2 mile drive I was concerned and the driver had no real explanation.  I  called back and because I had ordered online and then because they ran out of bread the order was processed as 2 separate orders and I was charged twice for the delivery fee. There was no talk of a refund of any sort. They had no remedy for the situation and explained it was an IT problem and they had a third party company controlling app orders. So much for a local establishment.  Food was good but I'm not paying 30 dollars plus tip for one pizza."}
{"text":"If you like really sweet sugary sauce then this is for you.  If you want something like you might enjoy in Italy, forget it.  These pizzas are sugar bombs.  Whether you like the taste is personal but I don't know anyone that wants to call in a pizza for pickup, be told it will be ready in 40 min only to get there on time and wait another 25 min.   At 10 minutes late, I asked how much longer.  They couldn't tell me.  Not a place I'm likely to visit again."}
{"text":"Their spinach pizza is to die for!  5 stars all the way.  Although I learned after the first time they put too much garlic on it for my taste so now I tell them easy on the garlic and it is perfection.  The sauce is so yummy and sweet.  The crust is thin and crispy.  Where they are lacking in is their appetizers.  This is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  The appetizer portions are small and overpriced for how much you get, which makes me sad.  The caprese \"salad\" is tiny and is missing something, I can't recal now.  And the Bruschetta is just weird.  I would love to see them step up this part of the menu.  I usually love caprese salad and bruschetta but I don't order it here.  It would be nice to enjoy one of those before the pizza.  The decor and ambiance is nice.  Haven't tried any desserts because I'm so full from the pizza.  I seriously can't stop eating it, it's that good."}
{"text":"Hands down the Best Pizza in town!  Best Sausage...Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Arizona!  IMHO. The Super-Six Pizza can't be beat. I've not tried the other dishes because the pizza is so good."}
{"text":"Just go and try their pizza and you'll see how good it is! Everything they serve is good but hands down best pizza I've ever had"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was jonesing for something Italian and this was the closest. I ended up getting the baked spaghetti calzone. Unlike the other reviewer, I thought it was fabulous. Very good. I got it to go, so the marinara was on the side, which I prefer. I've never had a baked spaghetti calzone and this was a great first experience. I'll definitely come back, maybe to sit and stay a bit."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Leaves you wanting more everything from the crust to the toppings and spices were perfect. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour in the bar area!  The staff is wonderful and the happy hour menu is very yummy! The meatball trio and signature pizzas are especially tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, friendly and cozy place! The pizza is delicious and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Everytime i have had take out.  Pizza is always good. Its well worth the extra money for a decent pie."}
{"text":"We tried Spinato's Pizza for the1st time tonight.  Four adults had an awesome antipasto salad and spinach, Roma tomatoes, and mozzarella pizza.  Go!"}
{"text":"This is a well thought of place and clearly one that puts care into their craft, but their sauce is too sweet for my tastes and detracts from what's otherwise a pretty good product.   If you like your pizza sauce sweet this place will be a home run for you, if you don't then it's probably going to be a miss."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place has good reviews at all. They're pizzas are gross and inconsistent, the pastas are not fresh and the chicken is like rubber. The service is hit or miss for speed but I have never had an unfriendly experience. This place could be so much better if they just made GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"SWEET SAUCE! The age old question about what makes pizza great, sauce or crust. While both are important, in my opinion, sauce is king. I tried Spinato's based on great word of mouth and the postings on yelp. I feel an obligation to write in and let all the sauce lovers of the world know that this sauce has more sugar than sweet tea in Georgia! I won't be returning and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Spinatos last week, despite the delivery charges. I've never had pizza from here before, so I gave it a whirl.  I ordered a large Chicago thin crust. It arrived when promised, 1 hour, and it was hot and they had included a lot of crushed red peppers and and parm in the box, without needing to be asked.  I was pleased, and the pizza was quite good.  I'll likely order from them again."}
{"text":"Very allergy-unfriendly. We asked to take an ingredient (that I'm allergic to) off a pizza and were charged an extra $5. Simply to remove an ingredient! General manager Dave, was spectacularly unhelpful. He even seemed embarrassed to discuss it with me. Honestly, this is the worst style of management; AKA \"the customer is always wrong.\" So many great dining experiences here, and one horrible one ruins it permanently. Thanks for the pizza Spinato's, but we won't be back, nor recommend your restaurant to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service every time. They have an awesome spaghetti calzone we all like. Our new Friday night family dinner go to."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I have never been disappointed at any of the 5 locations.  The pizza sauce takes a little getting use to and to be honest I was not a fan at first. After the third time though I acquired a taste for it. The freshness of all the other ingredients and the great customer service just put this local chain over the top.  The new Ahwatukee location took the place of Chili's on the NE corner of 48th St. and Chandler Blvd. This location has an extended menu from its four sister locations including additional appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. Spinatos take on a calzone is light (having significantly less bread than most calzones) fresh, and you can make any pizza or sandwich into a calzone. No gooey undercooked bread here. The crust is always thin and light but not to the point of feeling you are eating a cracker. The Brownie Bella Grande is simply amazing. I am not even a dessert guy but the warm brownie squares, gelato ice cream, and chocolate sauce is just too good to resist.   This is one of those local restaurants that just gets it. Great food, great prices, and great service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Spinatos. The pizzas are delicious and they have peroni on tap. There aren't many better ways to spend a hot Sunday afternoon in Phoenix. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA! First timer and was blown away. Get the \"Get Meaty\" pizza. Superb!!! Great service, nice warming environment, friendly staff, overall just a great place to eat and have a good time with family and friends."}
{"text":"Spinato's is by far the best pizza in Phoenix.  The sauce RULES!  THe crust is excellent too, as is the ambiance.  Service is always supurb.  It is especially nice to see a family-run restraurant; a rarity these days.  We have fond memories when the founder, Joe, would go table to table talking with the patrons, and sharing stories of the old days in Chicago.  We often take guests from out of town here, and they ask to go back, whenever they are in town!   Salads are great, and a very good portion, makes for sharing one with your guests possible.  This is THE PLACE to take anyone that you wish to impress with an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I love Spinatos, their pizzas never disappoint! I used to live close to this location but moved to the east valley where there is no Spinatos available.  I happened to be in the Ahwatukee area on Friday so I had to pickup a pizza to go. The pizza was ready for pick up in the time frame they said, and tasted just as good as I remembered.  My only recommendation would be to open a location in east chandler or gilbert area."}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome. I am such a critical pizza consumer and I can tell you that this is so good. Crust perfect, with just enough crisp balances with a warm softness, not a cracker, not mush. Sauce tastes like tomatoes (not too sweet, but great quality taste). I would drive an hour or more to eat there again."}
{"text":"We were in town for vacation - two families with 5 kids total. My husband is vegan and had the Greek salad - it was fine but overdressed with tangy dressing. I had the combination thin crust personal pizza. Tasty but could have been crispier.  Kids split large cheese and pepperoni- plenty for all of them and they liked the garlic bread, too.  Best part is kids' meals come with gelato - I got a kids scoop of pistachio and it was some of the best I've had, nutty texture and all.  Decent wine prices.  Server was nice but was overloaded and service was slow"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Spinato's previously & enjoyed my food & service, but my most recent visit was a disappointment to say the least. The waitress we had was a young lady with short red hair. Her poor customer service is what made the experience bad. She was extremely rude & the reason I will not be returning to this restaurant. It took her over 10 minutes to acknowledge us & to take our drink orders. We were almost done with our meal before she even bothered to check on us. I requested an additional breadstick & her response was to roll her eyes & state, \"Let me see if I can get you one.\" She never did bring the breadstick. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant/location."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great! Their sauce has a sweetness to it that most don't.  The staff is really friendly and the place is pretty quaint. My husbamd loves the Mamma' Calzone and their Get Meaty pizza is my favorite.  All in all its a great spot to try!!"}
{"text":"Finally! Good pizza in Phoenix. They understand what it means when you ask for a \"well done\" pizza.  No acidic taste to the sauce, big plus."}
{"text":"my wife and I absolutely love the food here, The meatball spaghetti calzone is our favorite, I highly recommend this meal!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Really good. however my experience with the pick up was terrible. I ordered ahead one gluten free pizza and one other regular pizza. I made sure the person taking my order knew it needed to be ready at 6 because I need to stop by on my way home from work get home quick and leave almost right away as I had to be somewhere by 730. I arrived at the restaurant a couple of minutes before six and my food was not yet ready. Which is fine. However after sitting there for more than 15 minutes I was told that my pizza had to be remade because it got lost. I was offered some cookies as an apology. however I cannot eat them because of my celiac. I looked at my receipt and it said in bold letters three separate times pick up at six in big bold letters. I'm very disappointed and sad I gave such a big tip as my requests were not followed.  Finally got my pizzas at 630. I will think twice before visiting again."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I finally had an excuse to go to Spinato's because everyone raves about it.  When I moved to Arizona from the east coast, I had a hard time finding a good pizza... always on the lookout for a good pizza.  Well, I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered a thin crust with cheese, as I like to just taste the basic pizza first.  I did not like their sauce at all.  It is too sweet for me and didn't taste fresh to me.  It didn't taste \"tomatoey\" either.  I thought, \"well it must be me,\" so I asked my husband.  He said, \"that's funny because I thought it was just me too.\"  I wasn't real impressed with the crust either.  The cheese was acceptable, I will give them two stars for that.    We brought some home for the kids, as we didn't eat but one slice each.  Our kids weren't that thrilled either.  Sorry Spinato's.  I know you have excellent fans, but your sauce didn't make me one.  I really wanted to like it too.  (Our family much prefers Barro's Pizza or Rush Street Pizza in Chandler.)"}
{"text":"This is a some what conflicted review.  Again, I wish Yelp would allow us to review multiple things. The staff was extremely friendly (maybe a tad too talkative), the location was nice and clean.  The food LOOKED great.  The pizza just wasn't that good. It's just way too sweet. And when I say sweet,  it's so extreme that it overshadows anything else about their pizza.  It's so different in taste, it makes it seem like the wrong sauce was used. (I know it wasn't)  If you don't like sweet sauce, then order something else as their was nothing else remotely wrong with the rest of my dinner. It's just I've had about 1000 other better pizzas."}
{"text":"My GF and I had an early dinner this evening! As expected the cocktails were good, food was mediocre but the service was disappointing. I worked in the business for many years and as a server I welcomed having people to serve. After all, isn't that's what I was hired for? It astounds me when we are treated as an intrusion versus a source of revenue to the business. This evening after ordering and served cocktails we were treated like we had some sort of contagious disease. The food was brought by another server. Our server did not ask us how our food was even though she checked on the table next to us 2-3 times without even once asking us how our meal was. Did not even glance at our table as she walked by us numerous times. Sneaky suspicion we were sitting at a table for four versus the two of us and she was upset she was not getting that early evening dinner rush. Felt like we were being ignored so we could leave and she can get four people at the table. Pretty damn rude! Well, needless to say, last time spending my hard earned money there. Plenty of other Italian places around with better food and after this place, much better service! At least I know my business will be appreciated."}
{"text":"A dissenting opinion... First timer & grabbed a calzone to go.  Eccck... halfway thru and made a pbj sandwich instead (and I'm a pizza nut).  Sauce... tasted tinny like the inside of a can, and super sweet with no real flavor profile.. Sausage... kind of tasted like the pre-cooked rabbit pellets little ceasars uses. Crust... thin & no 'bite' to it.  No, I wasn't expecting a deep dish crust, but this had no flavor and just crumbled as i ate.  Plus... great looking place, friendly staff, ready when promised. This wasn't a \"bad\" pizza because they did anything wrong.  If you like their flavors.. go for it.  Just compared to most local places of quality, it totally turned me off flavor wise.  Sorry folks, not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Order pizza for delivery at 8:30, 1hr delivery estimate.    9:52 I miss a call while I'm in the bathroom. 9:55 I return the call, no answer.  Try again, no answer.  Call main # at 9:58, no answer.  They close at 10..  Never got my pizza..  Great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm all in on Spinato's.  Best antipasto salad I have ever had.  The sauce is something else too, what is that sugar in it?  We have found our new local pizza place, I wish I found you 2 years ago when we move.  I have what you call an addictive personality and believe you me I want to be there daily."}
{"text":"Just stooped by the Chandler Blvd. location.  Bartender seemed annoyed that we were there.  Dirty counter and when we ordered a salad for there and pizza to go the pizza came before the salad.  Bartender seemed unconcerned but finally gave us a salad smashed into a container free of charge.  We have had great service on Thursday nights but apparently it depends on who's working.  Definitely felt unwelcome."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Spinato's, and we were in the mood for pizza, so we went the day we got the recommendation.  Our server was pleasant, made good recommendations and kept our drinks filled.  Upon seeing our difficulty making a decision on what specialty pizza to order, she suggested we do half & half...which worked out great...and we were pleased with both choices!  The salad was fine too...nothing special, but nothing to be embarrassed about either.  As others have mentioned, the sauce was sweet...which didn't bother us, but was a surprising difference from other pizza places we enjoy...although, I doubt it will become our preferred style of sauce, I'd certainly be up for in again in the not-too-distant future.  The thin crust was terrific and the toppings were high quality and plentiful.  We went on Sunday, and were surprised to learn that they close at 8pm, so be prepared...but, we noticed they were still seating people close to closing time. Seating was comfortable, especially considering they had a full house.  And, while it would be fair to say it was a bit noisy, it was nowhere near the volume one experiences at an Oregano's (in fact, as much as we like Oregano's food, we never dine in due to the volume level).  There are a number of good pizzas to be had in Chandler--probably the most well-represented category of above-average restaurant choices in our city---, in my opinion, Spinato's can hold it's own among them."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews about the pizza and having grown up in Brooklyn I was practically raised on pizza. I was very disappointed in the pie we had. We purchased the par cooked and finish at home pizza. We followed the instructions and found the pizza to not be up to what we had been expecting. The crust was not firm at all and the pizza had a overly strong oregano smell. I like oregano but this was overpowering. We might try it again but won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place!!  Very cool atmosphere, excellent pizza, and some pretty good wings.  Me likey!!  I brought my family here, and plan on being back soon!"}
{"text":"As far as customer service, they receive an A+. Wonderful staff.   Although, the food is not my cup of tea. I ordered a side caesar to begin and a pepperoni calzone. The caesar dressing was very fishy. The pizza sauce was way too sweet."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was pretty good.  I had the Wrigley sandwich ( Italian beef, sausage, peppers, onion and cheese) and my wife had the Chicago Penne pasta - all in all pretty good food and nice sized portions."}
{"text":"Spinato's adds 18 percent gratuity, in addition to a delivery charge, to delivered orders. No matter how good their product is, there is no justification for that, and they don't deserve your business."}
{"text":"Love...love...love Spinatos!  Honestly, one of the best pizzas in town.  I've been eating here since the mid 90's and it has consistently been great!  I usually get the Super Six.  It has everything on there except the kitchen sink!   The thin crust is never ever soggy and that sweet sauce is like crack to me!  The service is always great.  Do expect a wait on Fridays and Saturdays.  If you have more than 8 people in your party, prepare to wait atleast 1 hour or more on busy nights.  For an appetizer, totally go for the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Just had my first and last Spinatos pizza. I must say. ..it is NOTHING like Chicago pizza.  It was dripping with grease and the sauce was too sweet."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza we've had in years! Just moved here from CA and we will definitely be regulars here! Service by Diana was GREAT! The food was timely & correct despite our complicated order and tasted AMAZING from garlic bread appetizer, through pizza and all the way to dessert! Icing on the cake- they have a military discount! So glad we decided to try it out on a whim!"}
{"text":"This is s great Spinatos location as the newest location.  The is now a unique pumpkin desert and apple gelato that is very good.  Excellent service and our attentive server Michael even brought us a sample of the pumpkin gelato to try...also very good!   But we come for the pizza and we feel it is truly the best in the area. I used to never get any other pizza but I understand this means I pay a bit more for pizza. However,  it's money well spent when your taste buds thank you so enthusiastically!"}
{"text":"Serviceable as a general restraunt.  Nothing has officially impressed me nor upset me there.  The prices are reasonable for lunch and dinner however I do think their  calzones are on the smaller side especially for their price and amount of food you get.  In general I would recommend it for your average night out where you want a decent dinner without breaking the bank or even as a quick call in four lunch without frequenting the fast food arena.  Basicly it is your middle of the road restaurant of general applicability."}
{"text":"Great pizza, especially the thin crust spinach. Excellent pricing. I would recommend this to anybody."}
{"text":"I ate this pizza at work for the first time during a luncheon, I was hooked from the start. The family atmosphere, drink specials and old fashion customer service make it what it is... Special !! They take pride in providing a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff, great environment.   First you must understand that I don't like Italian food, nor am I a huge pizza fan, in my world Papa John's is good.  But I went to take my son, and because my best friend said it was great. When we got their the place was packed but no wait. (By the time we left they were lining up at the door)  As soon as we sat down our server got our drink order, and finding out it was out first time gave us some history of the place. I really enjoyed that.  We started off with their cheesy garlic bread with sauce on the side. My son who states hates garlic bread loved this, even stating he'd come back here just for that.  We followed up with each of is getting a personal pizza, mine was their \"Get Meaty\", my son had a pepperoni & pineapple, both on their version of thin crust. For the personal ones, to me this seems like standard hand tossed crust and it was divine.  We each ate half and brought the rest home. Totally stuffed!  With our two drinks, he a soda, me a tea, our bill was just over 20 bucks. Well worth it in my mind. Our glasses were never empty, never did plates lay around on our table but we also never felt rushed or bothered.  My new favorite place to eat near my house, as we walked out I got a glance at the pasta dished, I think they might be next on my list to try.  Another bonus, they not only have take out, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to stop for some pizza and wings. Thick pizza was OK but the wings were delicious!   The restaurant has a nice fancy theme and the bar was beautiful. ( I only glanced) The only thing that does not match is the employees!  For the restaurant looking very nice and elegant the hostess and servers were in jeans and running shoes?? One server even had a bandanna in her head! It just didn't go together. It made them look lazy and dirty."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here ,they do have Happy Hour which is great , they have outdoor seating , waiters are good , they sell the sauce and the salad dressing , I have made a wonderful lasagna with it they family loved it , we have been here many times and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Spinato's is great! So great, they need another location in central or Old Town Scottsdale as this location is quite small and always so busy!  Having lived in Chicago amongst great pizza, Spinato's is definitely up there. It's very similar to Lou Malnati's thin crust & Aurelio's. The Mamma Signature pizza is amazing. The garlic and spinach are always so fresh and the sauce has a subtle sweetness making it the perfect combination. I always get my pizza well-done and Spinato's always gets it right!  I would eat Spinato's more often if there was another Scottsdale location making less of a hassle. But... the wait is always worth it!"}
{"text":"checked out this place because its close to my house and Ive heard great things about it......My boyfriend and I ordered a pizza extra sauce and extra cheese kinda hard to mess that up but when we got home and opened the box it looked as tho they threw our pizza  up  against a wall or something sauce everywhere and hardly and cheese maybe it  was mixed in with the mess?To top it off the pizza wasn't even cut !!! I was so mad I threw it in the trash .My tip to people would be to make suew you open the box before leaving with your food maybe if I did that I would've been able to try this pizza my friends talk  so highly of."}
{"text":"We consider this our family's neighborhood pizzeria. We've been coming so long the staff recognize us and some know us by name. Our boys have grown up coming to this location at least once a month. Eat in or carry out its been a favorite, we take guests from out of town and bring it home for game time. The patio is very nice in the spring and autumn.  Try the baked spaghetti calzone, but be warned it is a lot of food. Maybe share for two."}
{"text":"The best service I've had in a long time. I've been a server/bartender for 8 years and I was very very impressed by the bar staff at spinato's on 7th St and Missouri.  They were prompt friendly and make some of the most well balanced and refreshing cocktails. Brody was our bartender and he made me a perfect jalapeño margarita. I don't often leave reviews but between the conversation and great food and drinks I was compelled to let the community know that if you're looking for friendly knowledgeable staff with great drinks and pizza you should stop by !! Thanks Brody me and my friend had a great time! !"}
{"text":"Slowwwwww service.   Extremely small kids portions (though they liked the spaghetti).  The calzone I had was ok - kind of weird for my meat calzone to not have pepperoni and sausage but steak.  And when I asked for marinara, they charged me for it.  Also, I was overcharged a few dollars for the kids meals and when I inquired, that was another 5 minutes just to get the correct amount."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a pizza to overthrow our beloved Grimaldi's pizza as the #1 pizza in Scottsdale. No one has come close; until Spinatos graced our plates. At the recommendation of a fellow nurse co-worker Spinatos was on our \"new things to try\" list. It sure did not disappoint. Their toppings are fresh. Their thin crust had a perfect balance of crispiness without the texture of a cardboard box. I didn't have to mop up a puddle of grease that so often comes with a pepperoni pizza. My only reservation: the sauce. The pizza sauce has a wonderful flavor, but does verge on being too sweet.  With all the pizza elements to take into consideration, one might ask did they beat out our beloved Grimaldis? No. But it's a damn close second."}
{"text":"Pizza was the best we have had since arriving in No Phoenix almost 4 years ago.  Caesar salad was great as well!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are tired of chain restaurants...you must try Spinatos. Incredible food...especially the pizza!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is my favorite pizza in the valley. The sauce is on the sweet side, but very good. I prefer the thin crust. The service has been above par every time I've been. They gave me a free second pizza once because they weren't satisfied that the first one had a bubble in the dough. I hadn't complained about it, they just weren't satisfied themselves. They gave me both for the price of one, and I happily ate both (with a little help from my daughter)."}
{"text":"Pros: The food is really good. Delivery is a nice touch. That is about where they greatness ends.  Cons: Long wait times can be a bit irritating. They are also not willing to substitute like for like items. They will willingly build your dish from the ground up ala carte style but that gets very pricey. All and all, this is not our go to anymore. Stick with a local place that is willing to cater to customers. I think their reputation is getting the best of them."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Was super busy so someone must like it. I had pizza and was not impressed. The take out people were very nice tho."}
{"text":"We have out of state family that we take here as the place to go and try. Everyone just LOVES this place.   My family loves it too.... thin crust to thick ..... doesnt matter what you order here it is always AMAZING! never had bad service   Very Happy!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and attentive, even when it's crowded. I like their pizzas. The only negative was the tomatoes on the Caprese salad weren't very good quality. They have good craft  beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Love Spinato's in Ahwatukee! Food is really yummy. We like to go on Wednesdays for half price bottles. My only insult is the restaurant side is always too hot. Probably has something to do with the kitchen location but I wish they'd keep it cooler in there! The bar is cute & cozy and is usually cooler."}
{"text":"Best sauce in town! Highly recommend the baked spaghetti calzone with extra mozzarella and the a la vodka sauce on the side...DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have been here a time or two. Each time my wife and I say ugh we need to remember not to come back here. The first time we came we thought it was awesome and were super excited to have a great place near by. Well if I remember we were drinking that night and have been disappointed EVERY time after that. Tonight our service was great but food not so much. I think we will finally throw in the towel on Spinatos. I say good day..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for family, friends or even date night! Each time I go, I'm treated like family.  Excellent service and excellent food at a great price.  My favorite is the Mama's Spinatos Signature Fresh Calzone with Ricotta.  It is out of this world good!"}
{"text":"Well, okeedokee - so the fam and I drove in from LA, and were going to hit Chino Bandido - 'cause, you know, EMERALD CHICKEN.  Anywhoo, we got in late and we'd already hit Panda Express in Palm Springs, so too much Chinese is no so fun, so we decided to hit some pizza instead.  I hit Yelp, and this place popped up - it was a little farther off where we were staying (Scottsdale Blvd), but worth the drive.  It's a hopping place on a Saturday night (keep in mind, it's 109 at 8:00, so the patio is sparsely populated), so we wait about 30 minutes (TIP:  ask to order your food while you wait, the food will hit you a lot faster).  We had the Margherita pizza which was just cheese, olive oil, basil, tomatoes and a TON of garlic, it was very good.  Nice crust with a crisp crackle, and the pizza had a ton of flavor.  Bruschetta was delish as well - crispy bread, yummy topping with gobs of garlic.  Would have like to have a little balsamic on there too to finish it off.  All and all, a good alternative to the chain monster restaurants that dot Scottsdale, and a nice local place to take the fam."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN ALL OF ARIZONA!!!!!!!! No need to drink a gallon of water after eating this"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I think that Spinatos makes the best pizza in the Valley.  But, the service at lunch today was crap at best.  Walked in for lunch at about 1:40 pm and stood around for five minutes before anyone came out from the back.  No help there so I sat myself after getting them to notice me.  It shouldn't have been too hard to be noticed since only three tables were occupied.  Two were finished and getting ready to check out and the other was just getting their food.  After finally taking my order for a small thin pizza, I sat at the table for the next 40 minutes.  I watched one pizza come out for take out and one addt'l pizza went to the table that had already been served.  I had been told my pizza would just be another two minutes.  After ten more minutes had gone by my lunch hour was over and I had to leave for work ( I was late getting back) so I just got up and left.  So thanks for contributing to what will be fun afternoon while I starve.  Although I usually go to Spinatos about once a week, I won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"definitely the best pizza I have EVER tasted! I just moved to Az from New Jersey in May and I am glad I found this place, however I will soon start a diet and will only be able to eat here once a week! :)"}
{"text":"We came to see Maria after not coming a few weeks. We were sad Maria was on vacation. She is the best!!  We were upset that the price of the meatballs went up $2 on happy hour. The savings is $.95 from regular menu......not much of a happy hour savings."}
{"text":"On August 25th I went to the Bell Location which is 16th St and Bell. I ordered a number of pizzas and a antipasto salad and I paid 87.00 dollars and after I checked out I asked if they put pepper in the dressing and I told her I am allergic to pepper , I asked if they had any dressing and the girl told me they had pomegranate  dressing. I was told after spending all that money they told me it would be 60 cents , I called the manager at that location and told me that was there policy shame on them. I will take my business else where . A customer should not be treated that way  when you spend that much money."}
{"text":"Wonderful new location!  Staff was amazing from our server Keiko to the wait staff assistants and Ken the owner came over to check in on us! We had the Salsicca Di pollo pizza and the Apple pecan salad.. Amazing"}
{"text":"After waiting to be seated for over an hour we were told it would be another 50 minutes for our pizza. Waiter said they had 50 pizzas in front of ours. What was so frustrating was there were take-out orders being taken and filled prior to the people being served in the restaurant. I don't care how good their pizza is POOR management doesn't make for good business."}
{"text":"First visit, and just eating at bar on my own.  Wanted a speciality pizza but no ham.  The bartender said that isn't allowed without \"creating your own\" pizza option, which would cost more.  I asked to talk to a manager.  A couple of minutes later, I suggested to the manager it doesn't make sense to have to pay more for just holding one item (I wasn't trying to substitute anything).  He agreed but said it is company policy set by the owner and that he is not allowed to override the policy.  This is bad policy.  I ended up ordering the pizza, had to dig out the ham, and then it got thrown away.  Such a waste.  The pizza was tasty. I would suggest to the owner to have some flexibility on common sense policy.  The manager suggested the possible reason for the policy is the kitchen chef is too busy to deal with these requests.  I would suggest that it only takes a split second to see the order \"no ham\" and would not slow the process down.  Not to mention then food would not be wasted.  I feel sorry for the employees who have to enforce and explain this excessive policy, as both the bartender and manager said they agreed with my logic.  The one star rating is solely for the company policy."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Spinato's for some time, but never found myself in the neighborhood to stop in and try it...until yesterday...WOW!! I can't comment on the dining-in service, but I definitely have something to say about the pizza!   Some say it's hard to mess up a pizza, and other say pizza preferences are personal. What I loved about the pizza here was that the sauce was not too salty, not too sweet, and not too tomatoe-y/out of a can tasting. It was perfect! The cheese also quality and aplenty. I haaaaate when places skimp on the cheese. The toppings were great and also not sparse. The pizza didn't have an inch of grease on it and didn't have that soggy middle bottom like some places leave their pizzas. The crust was thin enough so that you didn't feel like you might as well have ordered a bread basket, but not so thin that you felt like you were eating off a cracker.   As Chicagoans, we had the Chicago pizza...fantastic!!! I can't wait to come back here again and try their other pizzas and calzones. So happy I was introduced to the greatness that is Spinato's!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza you can get period!.  Pizza is hot, good quality and top notch ingredients!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place - delicious pizza and courteous staff!  We had the Large Veggie pizza and a family Greek salad.  Exceptional pie (crust, toppings).  The salad was loaded - pepperoncinis, fresh feta, red onions, crispy lettuce, kalamata olives, tomatoes...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We frequent Spinato's atleast once a month and the pizza is amazing. Customer service when you pick up is always top notch and they make sure you're satisfied with the product before you even leave! Both the thin crust and sicilian are great as well."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for pizza!  Their antipasta salad is wonderful with their house Italian.  Mama's Signature spinach, tomato and garlic pizza should not be missed.  The kids always get the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Spaghetti calzone sounds odd, I know, but if you're feeling adventurous, you should definitely try it.  They also have the best gluten free crust!  I order it even though I don't have any problem with gluten.  Their family recipe sauce is sweeter than most but still very good.  If you're looking for a local pizza place you can't find anywhere else, you don't want to miss this!"}
{"text":"Everything about this meal was great!!! Calzone and pizza we perfect and tasty. Even though the restaurant was busy the food came out in the perfect time and obviously came from the oven to our table.  For desert we had the Apple Serenata, it's a type of Apple desert that is specific to this restaurant and I'd come back just to have it again. If you're looking for a neighborhood restaurant with great food and friendly service stop here!"}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review, any misspelled words is due to my buzzness from the EtOh kikikikikikikikikiki.   Place is easy to find. Plenty of parking. Friendly service. My server was Anna. She was delightful.   Heard this place rivals one of my favorite pizza joints back in Cali (Grimaldi's) so Wats a guy gotta do? Go cheggit out of course !!!!  They have Peroni on tap which is a plus. A great Italian beer that I love. After 4 peroni's I'm writing this review so u all know the truth always comes out when u got a good buzz kakakakakaka.   Place is very clean. Service is excellent. Now for the nitty gritty. Ordered the meatball trio and garlic bread with mozzarella cheese on top. Both were pretty dammmmmmmm guuuuuuuuuud, I must say. I'm a sucka for meatballs n sausage n this place delivers on the meatballs lol.   Ordered the \"got meat\" thin crust pizza. Pizza came out great !!! However, too much meat on my thin crust pizza that it kinda weighed it down, but u know wat, who the buck cares lol. Pizza tasted great !!! The marinara sauce is a bit in the sweet side which I'm not used to but overall it was a good pizza.   Actually ordered a shietload of food that I cannot finish. But u know wat, I had to try a bit of as much as I could to write this review for u guys n gals.   All in all, pizza not as good as Grimaldi's (IMO) but they definitely hold their own. I would definitely return for the food, customer service, atmosphere anddddddddddddddddd I ran out of ideas LOL !!!!!! So come on by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I had heard how good Spinato's was in the past, but had never tried it until this past Friday night. We decided to have them deliver & ordered the following: their signature pizza (med), small dinner salad, garlic bread sticks (4) & apple serenata for dessert. The pizza was pretty good, but the sauce was a lil too sweet for us. Hubby liked his salad, it was pretty standard as far as salads go. The bread sticks were good & came with delish marinara sauce. The apple thingy was pretty good but they don't deliver ice cream (understandable), so I don't think I got the full effect. Overall, we might order from here again but we're not in any hurry.  P.S. I loved their family photo on the pizza box!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love the thin crust. The dining room is pretty loud, but for takeout, the pizza can't be beat."}
{"text":"I could have baked a frozen pizza better then what I ate today.  The server argued everything that we said, and literally wouldn't let us order thin crust.  Maybe if the server allowed us to order what we like instead of what he \"eats every Sunday\", it would have been a better experience.  I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Great food and service is good.  Try the Mamas signature spinach pizza- yumm!"}
{"text":"Tomato sauce here was quite tasty, as I was referred to this place for the sauce alone :-).  Pizza was more of a medium crust in my book, not really thin, and certainly not Chicago thin crust.  Whatever they call it, it is a bit too thick for me if it is meant to be in the thin category.  And it seems a little undercooked for the thickness.  Nonetheless, very good overall, both in flavor and in value and service for this restaurant.  I like it."}
{"text":"Spinato's. Where shall we begin? First of all my boyfriend and I were looking to try someplace new, and thanks to you Yelpers we found Spinato's! FANTASTIC PIZZA.  I feel ruined.  I could never eat from another pizza joint and feel okay about it...This place is in its own league. The only knock on this location is the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once a month. Food is amazing.  It gets busy from like 4-7 so we usually wait until after the rush so we can take our time.  Fridays they have $5 off a bottle of wine which is nice."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting. If I could give it a - 10 stars I would. Their Steak and Cheese Sandwich tasted like it had Zippo Lighter fluid sauce on it and their Chicken Marsalla with Pasta was even worse. Our waiter Joey was very rude and continuously messed up our order and we waited almost an hour for our food and another half hour for it to be fixed. Will never eat there again. Ever!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place and lucky me, super close to home! I always get it to take out, so I can't comment on decor, but the service is always fast and friendly. When a friend suggested it, I was not enthusiastic because I think of Chicago pizza as that gross deep dish mess. I was pleased to hear their thin crust pizza is super thin. I was suprised that they slice their round pizza into rectangles, but it works well. Now I find myself thinking about how good their pizza would taste... and how nice it would be not to cook. Oh, and when you get peppers and grated cheese they give you the nice fresh stuff in little cups rather than those nasty packets of dried up light brown stuff."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Phoenix! Typically I like a lot of toppings on my pizza but when I go to Spinato's I only have cheese pizza because they do a phenomenal job with seasoning and sauce. We also love their Artichoke Crostini appetizer, their spaghetti calzone (added ricotta cheese), and their beef calzone. This place is definitely worth trying! My family and I enjoy the interior of the 7th street location more than the Bell location, but that's just preference."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley!  Love to bake at home too!  Great service."}
{"text":"Visiting from Ca. We found Spinato's. The pizza was delicious the beer was cold and the service was great. A great atomsphere."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!!!! I had half Hawaiian half spicy Italian on thin crust & it was so good!! The cheese to sauce to toppings to bread ratio was perfect. It's going to be my new go to pizza place. Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh!  The thin crust on the pizza was great, the caprese appetizer very good, and the antipasto salad entree very large and good.   Service was good, friendly, helpful and not neglectful. Went on a very busy night and they still had room for us, waited only a couple of minutes.   Will go back if we ever go back to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Chicago style thin crust, cut into squares, very good sweet sauce and alot of great cheese. Spicy Italian is one of our fav's + mama's spinach pizza. Can't go wrong with this Pizza - you will crave it. For something different try the Spaghetti and meatball calzone. Couple of good beers on tap and nice canoli's if you still have room. Wish it was bigger on weekends expect a wait."}
{"text":"The pizza is always amazing. This was our first time dining in, we've always ordered out.. It was a steady Sunday night, we were seated right as we arrived.  Our server was attentive, checked on us throughout our meal. Best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Ted S. Somehow every time I have a take out order I can't get away from ordering their large GET MEATY pizza! I just stop eating it!!!!. My wife orders their custom calzones, and loves them!!!! The staff remembers you, and are always friendly. In the busy season, this place is very popular so paring can be an issue, but solved by ordering early....this is the the best pizza restaurant around!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a decent place but had a REALLY BAD experience recently - food poisoning.  We ordered a spinach pizza without cheese and four of us shared it.  All four were doubled over the next day with cramps and the rest of it.  Called the store and they promised to follow up and call back but never did.  Shows that they are not only careless but also seemingly willing to play fast and loose with customer loyalty.  Hope the City of Scottsdale gives their operations a careful look.  Will not be going there again ever."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous pre theatre dinner here. The stuffed mushrooms were wonderful and the meatballs were the best I have had anywhere and I lived in Chicago for 30 years. Great waitress as well."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Spinato's since the late 80's when they had one little store in Tempe.  Their expansion is well deserved due to hard work and great food.  As much as I love the expanded menu, we are still in love with the product that we made us such fans for 30 years...  Spinach calzone, extra spinach with garlic and tomatoes!!!  OMG!!!!!   Don't get wrong the pizza is great, but we love what we love!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today, and great service,  quite environment,  sweet yummy pizza! And the pizza didn't take long to make at all! If you like a sweeter sauce, I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I asked my server if they had any lunch specials and her reply was \"no, but good for you, everything here is special\". I like the confidence, well done, Diana.   I went the 11\" size Chicago pizza, since Diana felt that the 7\" wasn't enough for me, and that she probably heard my stomach growl. 11\" was just enough pizza for me. Supposedly, it serves 2-3, but I know what I'm about.   Now, it wasn't your traditional Chicago deep dish pizza, but it was still a pretty good pie. What was impressive was that even with all the toppings (sausage, peppers, onions, mozzarella), the crust had no flop.   The pizza had good crisp, and it came out piping hot, which Diana informed me that it would be. She also told me not to burn my taste buds. So I didn't. I instead burned the roof my mouth on the first slice. No big deal, I'm sure it'll heal quickly.   TL;DR awesome server, good pie, burnt roof of my mouth (so you know the food comes out hot)."}
{"text":"This place is great! A little on the small side if you're dining in, seating is limited,  but all in all they have pretty good pizza, decent service, and a cool small Italian family owned restaurant feel. The garlic cheesy bread appetizer is great too, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, awesome spaghetti calzones and friendly service. We always get our pizzas extra crispy and we love it. We're a fan of Spinato's!"}
{"text":"We drove in from Surprise. I called Spinatos on the road and tried to make a reservation for 6. I was on hold for 3 minutes. They eventually picked up and informed that they do not accept reservations. So I asked about the wait. I was put on hold again. They picked up and told me 20 minutes. I asked if I could put our name on the list. I was told they don't do that either. So when we walked in, we were dismayed to find that they now had a 35 minute wait.  A party of 6 is unusual enough that it should merit some consideration. I find this to be a weakness in their commitment to customer service.  We drove across the street to Stock and Stable and were seated immediately.  Our experience with their food had only been positive. But this was a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Ahh...Spinato's, Spinato's, I love you.  I've only been here a few times and every time our waitress has been Maria.  (I'm embarrassed if this is not her name because this is what I've called her).  This waitress ROCKS!  She makes you feel like you are part of the family and yes, she actually has a personality.  She makes you want to return just so you can be waited on by her!  - Aside from the very enthusiastic and bubbly Maria, the food is wonderful!  My niece and nephew pretty much only like Italian right now, so I eat at a lot of Italian places.  The kids, including me, very much enjoy the food and service.  (yes, I mentioned the service again because it's worth mentioning!)  My favorite here is the Marguerite Pizza.  Yum Yum!  Also, if you can, try the canola.  It's not the best I ever had, but it's still pretty good.  Oh, and there's outdoor seating as well.  It's good for a small group get together, but nothing too large."}
{"text":"Such a great pizza spot. Anyone from Chicago can compare this pizza and sauce to Aurelio's."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them a few times and the pizza is top notch. Nothing in a 5 five mile radius really compares. I had ordered delivery during the dinner rush and was ok with the 60 minute delivery time. As I was placing my order I noticed that they didn't have a text box for miscellaneous requests like peppers or plates like most pizza places, nor was there an option to pay for these additional items, which I don't mind doing. I picked up the phone and called the store and waited 10 minutes on hold. Again, I understand this was during the dinner rush. When the server returned to my call, I asked if he could make sure that there were additional peppers and cheese as we were having additional people over later that evening, and he said he would make  sure that additional cheese and peppers were in the box. Pizza finally gets here and it's delicious; I just wish there were condiments that I was promised that I could share with my friends."}
{"text":"Completely addicted to the Italian beef sandwich but that might be an understatement. I add mozz, mushrooms and order extra au ju. Now, I would normally give it 4 stars but the reason I gave an overall 3 is because they are ALWAYS screwing up my take-out orders! Luckily, I keep on hand ingredients at home but I shouldn't have to. Also, whoever makes the sandwiches needs to be more consistent on how much meet you put on a sandwich every time. Sometimes it's a nice fat sandwich and other times not so much meat :( If they improved on consistency and accuracy I would give it 4 maybe 5 stars. Oh, and the pizza is pretty good if you like sweet sauce. If you don't then you probably won't like there's. PLEASE Spinatos improve on the sandwich side!!!"}
{"text":"heard alot of great things about this place.  I was disappointed.   The place looks very nice, the staff is very friendly.   Customer service is great.   Canoli was very good.  Reason for the 2 star is the sauce it is very sugary.   In my opinion sauce should not taste like this.   I cant eat anything here that has sauce.   The pizza is very overated, highly disappointed.   For pizza rays, sardellas are better options."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! Absolutely love this place! The staff, food, beer! I recommend mama's signature pizza!!"}
{"text":"OMGthis pizza is the bomb that's all i gotta say!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  It costs a little more than some places but well worth it.  I reccomend the signature pizza."}
{"text":"This experience was amazing!! Great Chicago style pizza and delicious wine !! Great company and awesome scenery!"}
{"text":"Roach crawling down the wall behind my husbands head. We were seated in the booth right next to the kitchen.  Service was great we've been here before. We really like the food. Just really couldn't eat much this time kinda turns your stomach .  We ordered the gluten free garlic cheese bread with marina. It was yummy.  Before our entrees were brought out I saw the roach crawling down the wall. It went behind the picture and I thought good we don't have to deal with it. Then it crawled out and headed down the wall to my husbands head that's when I quietly handed him my napkin and said please turn around and take care of that. He was surprised but squished it. The waitress was walking by and saw him do it. We quickly handed it off. The manager came to my side and thanked us for being so nice about not making a scene. I just look at him and said thats just gross and not what you want to see. He said I will comp you a desert. I just smiled still feeling like what?  My husband got his calzone said it was good. I had the DaVinci sandwich. I forced down half . The waitress said her manger was giving us a free desert and we smiled and said no thank you. She later came back and apologized again and said he will be taking 25 % off the bill. Again we just smiled . We actually just wanted to leave. The lady in the next booth did ask why are they apologizing to you. We did tell her and she said oh oh and we're by the kitchen. We smiled paid our bill and left.  We won't be eating here again.  I do believe that if you watch someone kill a roach while eating at your restaurant and they do it discreetly you should  take care of the bill. Since it did ruin our meal."}
{"text":"Went with friends. Atmospere is very nice - cool and trendy - even as another poster stated. We enjoyed our food. There was pizza, calzona and a pasta dish. There reason why the four stars is because the pasta dish was lacking. Seafood was good but the noodles were not prepared well. Would go again for pizza or calzones and salad."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza my family & I have ever tasted. We had cheese bread, pizza and cheese ravioli and all of it was excellent.  We also tried the apple/cinnamon dessert which also was outstanding.  We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'll never forget their sauce. ITS OVER-THE-TOP ON SWEETNESS.  I'm sure, that for some ...... they can't get enough of it !  Well, for me .... once is enough."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!  We were recommended this place for pizza by someone that has been many times and thought we would try it out, As per usual we were too late for happy hour!  Lol We arrived and noticed the parking lot in front was full indicating it was popular. Greeted by super friendly host staff and some how managed to get a table !  We had artichoke appetizer. (Marinated artichokes, garlic, and cheese of fresh toasted baguette) . It was delicious.  We held back and didn't finish it as  we had ordered 2 small pizzas. (I know lots of food for 2, right?)  The app and the pizzas were delicious!  Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. I really relaxed and enjoyed ! House red was just fine and beer selection was good too!   The sauce on the pizza is on the sweet side and I believe it is house made.  We didn't have room for dessert but we will def be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered it this weekend. They cut the pizza into squares instead of slices and i really like crust :( the sauce was good though.  It tasted really good the next morning unmicrowaved so i appreciated that.  I usually order Barros so im forgiving of this place for not being better since Barros is pretty bomb.  I'd eat Spinato's again but only if there wasn't a Barros OR Venezia's close by."}
{"text":"Worth every penny and then some. The secret is in the sauce I am pretty sure. The pizza is thin crust and sliced into squares so each piece is easy to handle. Meats are great and fresh, spegetti calzone is amazing, and prices are really good for the quality you get. Be warned though...,once you have Spinato's pizza the other stuff just won't do."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.  The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only tried the pizza. Crispy, thin crust is the best part. The pizza is round, but they cut it in a grid. I don't understand that, and not really sure what all the hubbub is about this place. Sauce is way too sweet."}
{"text":"I have been to spinatos numerous times but this was the first time at this location. The food was excellent as expected. I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and was not disappointed. The service was very pleasant and timely. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I have always just gotten to-go but they are almost always packed inside so i assume the service is great too.  Everyone that caters to the pick-up side has always been wonderful.  Calzones are really good, though i feel like they changed their pepperoni in the past year as something seems to have changed.  Either way it's still really good."}
{"text":"Gotta say this place was pretty dam good. First I had an appetizer of Garlic Bread with cheese. Hands down...the best garlic bread I've ever eatin. From the crunch of the crust, the flavor of the cheese and the marinara sauce...wasn't too tomatoey(word?). It actually had a little sweetness to it.   Also tried a small order of wings with medium sauce. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice/heat...don't judge me...but they were juicy and well cooked. (Not pictured)  Pizza was thin crust. Half pepperoni and the other half was Hawaiian (pineapple w/ ham). Flavored were on point.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good pizza and garlic bread. Not to mention the atmosphere was very chill. Games were on the tube and the people looked good."}
{"text":"I live near this joint, so I've both eaten there at least a dozen times, and ordered delivery a few times.  Let me tell you something: this is both a pretty good pizza joint, and not a bad Italian joint in general!  First off, they have a sandwich which I believe is called the Grilled Da Vinci - it's awesome.  It's enough to fill up even a seriously hungry dude (like myself) and delicious from end to end.  The bread is perfect, the meat is fresh and tender, the italian dressing is fantastic (ask for some extra italian dressing to dip the sandwich into).  Ah!  Mamma Mia!  The pizza is pretty fantastic too.  All of the ingredients, fresh, plentiful - what else do you want?  The atmosphere in here is good.  It's not too classy that I feel like I have to dress up, but it's classy enough that you can take a date here or show up for a couple drinks and just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Given the improbable task of finding a restaurant for 22 people at 6pm on a Saturday night, I brought the extended family to Spinato's.  I'm so glad I did.  The manager went out of his way to make sure that we were accommodated quickly, the service was excellent and so was the food.  All 22 people left happy, thanking me for the suggestion and raving about how good the food and service were.  If being able to satisfy such a large group on short notice isn't a sign of a great restaurant where the management and staff really know what they are doing, then I don't know what is.  We will definitely be bringing our small family back again and again after the relatives head back out of town!"}
{"text":"I actually ate a slice and threw the rest away.  The thick crust was hard and not fresh and nothing was right about the rest of it either."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say except \"YUM\"!  They have the best pizza in the universe. The restaurant is very nice and service is very efficient and friendly. I love their thin crust -- not too crunchy, not soggy, not too much bread, just a lot of perfect. Their sauce is special -- flavorful and just a little sweet. My favorite is pepperoni and basil. Their Greek salad is also great.   Give yourself a treat and check this place out!"}
{"text":"New site at 7th st and Missouri looks spectacular. Can't ask for a better looking building. Food was great as usual from spinatos. We ordered a side salad each with the main course being the meat pizza. The side salad was a full bowl serving and if you are a light eater it is good to know that. Since I am not a light eater I was happy to see it. The pizza was very good but a little over sauced for my liking. The flavor of pizza from spinatos is always great and has a sweet tang to the sauce. This location is close to where my wife works and gives me another reason to travel down there. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Spenato's on our return home to Scottsdale.  We can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  I am a celiac and they knock themselves out for people like me.  Not only do they have gluten free pizza that is fresh and delicious, they have introduced gluten free garlic bread which was such an unexpected pleasure and very delicious.  Salad is reliably fresh.  My husband had his favorite, spaghetti and meatballs.  The staff is friendly and personable.  They make you feel like family.  Service is prompt and efficient.  in the rare instances where they make mistakes, for example, croutons on my salad, it is always whisked away and replaced with a sincere apology.  When either of us goes there alone, they go to extra trouble to make sure we don't feel isolated or lonely during dinner.  And, we are originally from New York and we love the pizza.  Ellen H"}
{"text":"Love this place! The super six pizza and Greek salad were amazing. The sweeter sauce on the pizza provides a refreshing change from all the other pizza places in the valley. Please please open a restaurant in north Peoria."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite Pizza Places!! The food is always great! Their marinara sauce is to die for! As well as their baked spaghetti calzone, pizza, and tiramisu. Honestly it's hard to pick what to eat every time because everything is so delicious!  Also, delivery is consistent and the service when dining in is always great! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I love their gluten free pizza. Is so good. I've tried so many GF pizza and I have to say that Spinato's is by far the best in taste! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We made a take-out order for 4 people based on a recommendation.  The food was sublime.  Easily if I had made this review then, I would have given them 5 stars.  We had 2 calzones with pesto sauce, anti-pasta salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and the Chicago pizza.  Everything was amazing.  Last week we made the same order but in larger portions, hoping for left over to eat the next day.  It was a completely different experience.  Everything was sub par.  Our hopes of finally finding a consistently amazing Italian restaurant had been shattered.  We didn't even finish our food and through what was left out.  I can't say we'll be back.  It's a long drive, and too expensive for the chance to be so badly disappointed again.  I would have given less stars if not for the first experience.  I at least know that they have the potential for excellence, if not the guarantee."}
{"text":"The place is decorated amazingly but the food isn't all that great. The food takes forever to make and they messed up twice on our order. Shannon our server was very polite and nice except she never introduced herself , we read her name on her name tag. Their ice cream isnt all that great but brownie is delicious"}
{"text":"The 4-star rating is because of the taste.  Price:  150% of what you'd expect to pay  Service:  Excellent.  the service staff is friendly, smiley, and seem glad you're there.  Taste:  absolutely wonderful.  The sauce is sweeter than most.  I've only gone to the location south of Tempe Marketplace, and it seems kind of industrial.  I can EASILY overlook something like that for a lower price, so I'm ready for lower prices."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Tasty sauce and homemade Italian sausage! I usually get the spinach pizza and I add the homemade Italian sausage! I need to branch out next time I go any suggestions?"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the world.  There, I said it. It's the best pizza in the Phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Sever was slow Difnt offer drink refills it also took way to long to get our food very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not from New York....but I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express.  Pizza here is some of the best thin crust I've ever had.  I ordered  the Meaty pizza and it was absolutely delicious.  If I were from around the Chandler area I'd make thjs place my go to pizza.  Service was good and the milk stout beer was good too."}
{"text":"For a city saturated with Little Cesar's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's this place is a welcomed site. I've always had great service and really, really good pizza.  I'm not generally a spinach fan, but their spinach pizza (award winning) has to be the best around.  It would have to take a lot to dethrone this place as my favorite pizza joint.  Their cheesy garlic bread is also pretty good."}
{"text":"While their food is hands down the best in town, I also need to give their employees 5 stars.  Tonight I called in my typical pizza order but unfortunately, I was involved in a car accident on my way to pick it up.  When I called to let them know I couldn't make it they were more concerned for my personal safety then a pizza that didn't get picked up.  About 30 minutes later, I got a phone call from Spinatos asking if I still wanted my pizza because they were going to deliver it for free.  While I was already upset with the accident, their kindness overwhelmed me.  They had known I had a rough night and wanted to make it better.  This may sound dramatic, but in a fast paced city these guys restored my faith in humanity.  I will always buy and recommend their food, now I cannot stop raving about a family owned business where their employees take customer service seriously.  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"After we moved to Phoenix we searched for restaurants that had birthday deals. Spinato's sent us a birthday coupon so we figured we've give it a try. My husband and I fell in love with the pizza, environment and that wonderful vodka cream sauce! We loved that the owner walked around visiting with the customers, it is a very homely environment. They even gave our pregnant friend a baby onesie. We love going back for pizza and meatballs, and of course buying a jar of the vodka cream sauce to take home. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One word...delicious! Every time my food is awesome and service has been great! I would recommend to anyone, the pizza is mouth watering! I always buy a medium pizza for myself so I can have leftovers which taste amazing too!!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars on the pizza, 5 stars on the service and happy hour.   Started off with the artichoke crostini which even my 3 year old surprisingly loved.   Then had the spinach salad with candied pecans and Pomegranate Vinaigrette dressing which my wife loved.   Got two small pizzas.   One would have been enough for the four of us.    The sauce was heavy and super sweet which I like.   Was not the best pizza I ever had by no means but definitely was very good.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. Bartenders solid and attentive. Will definitely be back in the near future"}
{"text":"I have never had a pizza like this before.. It's definitely a unique family recipe!!!! It's like a sweet sauce kinda, to die for bread and cheese... Can't stop thinking about it truthfully. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza Heaven. I have yet to try something at this restaurant that isn't brag worthy. Salads are amazing. Spaghetti Calzone is out of this world. Their sauce is sweet. No need to order extra sauce extra cheese because it isn't meant that way. In my opinion, the sauce is made at this level of sweet so that extra sauce isn't required. Extra cheese and you are drowning out that sauce that is to die for. If you are an extra sauce kind of person, ask for it on the side. Truly, they have their menu down to a science. Another plus is that they have a take & bake option. As well as a jar of sauce for purchase to take home.   They have outside seating for when great weather emerges. Waiting area is a bit cramped but I suppose that is why the bar is right there.  They hire great staff - friendly and attentive. Highly recommended Spinato's."}
{"text":"Words don't do justice!  The best Phoenix pizza around & the bartender just said that they deliver anywhere in the US so I'll be ordering this from Texas!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great for takeout medium pizza.  Ordered online and they said it would be ready in 30 min.....we got there at 35 and waited another 30 min, but it was Sat night and they were crazy busy."}
{"text":"The food is good, I like the ravioli's, pizza and wings. The staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is casual, the music is relaxing. They have great happy hour specials. The patio is awesome to hang with friends when the weather permits."}
{"text":"My first time here after my husband and several friends talk about it all the time. Happened to come during Happy Hour. Ordered the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad, breadsticks with cheese, and small  Mama's Special pizza. My husband also got food. Everything was beyond amazing! Hot, delicious cheesebread. The pizza was large enough to fill me up eating half, but I also could've polished it off. For the price, there was no sence in sharing! The salad was entree size, but definitely added another level to the meal and was great for appetizer sharing.   The food will have me coming back, for sure,  but our waitress Maria will have me loyal to this location. Friendly, funny and full of life,  she sold us on the experience. There's no doubt she loves her job, jet employer, and most importantly, her customers. As we  enjoyed our meal several other patrons were seated and Maria wound up with table after table of regulars. Seriously felt like we could end up part of the Spinatos Family!"}
{"text":"I had an issue with my pasta dishes. The manager Gabby was so professional and helpful and made it right.  We have been going here since they opened and have ALWAYS loved the food. Since some of the pasta dishes are new I think they are trying to make them just right. Gabby did not make me feel uncomfortable about speaking up and was so disarming and friendly. The five stars for the review is given to Gabby...An excellent manager with excellent customer service.  It could have turned out bad...If not handled correctly Spinato's would have lost a very good customer.  Thank You GABBY!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great pizza.   Pizza was absolutely fantastic.  Service was friendly on the phone, delivery was on time and courteous and the price was very reasonable.  I'll want to try the restaurant now-- absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had here and definitely beat any other delivery.  Home run!"}
{"text":"At some distant time when Phoenix is all but ruins and covered over by the sands of the desert, the people who yet live will weep in anguish, not for the lost progress of science, or the greatness of our architecture, but for the fact they can no longer get Spinato's pizza.  Count yourselves incredibly fortunate to be living in The Age of Spinato's."}
{"text":"It's good pizza! just wouldn't trust this location.  I think I just got hung up on by the \"manager\" on duty.. Been going in there since I moved to Phoenix. Thought I would ask if they deliver?  Got hung up on!!! I have never written a review but totally unprofessional.  If you have another location within distance I suggest you go there. But the pizza is good!!"}
{"text":"They make a very good pizza! The sauce is probably the best part as it is slightly sweet and very tasty! They also have really good salads, which is hard to find at most delivery pizza places.   My only complaint about Spinato's (the reason I didn't give them 4 stars) is because the wait times for delivery are SO long. At minimum they are an hour, but usually they take 1.5-2+ hours. The most frustrating part about the long delivery times is that sometimes the pizza arrives cold after the long wait.   However, it definitely is worth trying Spinato's if you haven't!"}
{"text":"We'd been getting takeout pizzas from the Glendale location for a long time...the pizzas were great and service was always fantastic.  But we won't go into this location anymore.  I'm with other reviewers...the service is hands-down bad.  I'd been in a couple of times just after it opened, and the main dining room is really loud.  Knowing that my hard-of-hearing husband (who wasn't with me either time) would have a hard time, I asked about seating in the much quieter bar and was told twice that it was open seating.  So when I finally came in with my husband, there were two parties waiting, so I confirmed with the hostess stand that the bar was open seating and we sat down at a table.   After a couple of minutes, a young woman came over and asked if we checked with the hostess stand and I assured her that we did.  She then told us that we couldn't sit there, and I explained that we were told that it was open seating in the bar and it's much quieter and easier for my husband to hear in the bar.  Most bars have open seating, so I was a I little surprised when she snapped that it was open seating AT the bar, not IN the bar.  (I'm not sure how I missed the preposition three different times, but it's possible that I did.)  We got up to move, but even though there were several open tables around us and several in the dining room, she made no effort to apologize or to re-seat us.  The most appropriate response would have been:  \"I'm sorry, this table isn't available, but stay here and let me find an open table for you.\"  When that wasn't forthcoming, I said to my husband \"well, let's just go somewhere else.\"  At this point, she still could've saved the day, but she said the two words a customer never wants to hear at this point:  \"Oh, OK.\"  She clearly suffered from a lack of training, a lack of maturity, or a lack of experience (or all three)...and a boatload of apathy.    Needless to say, we haven't been back (this was 6 months ago)...which is too bad because we live within walking distance and figured we'd visit often.  Fortunately, it's not the only good pizza place in the area..."}
{"text":"Called and put on hold for five minutes. Called back and asked for help and told them how long I was on hold. They said - hold please. Another four minutes and I gave up. Sad because the pizza is good."}
{"text":"First, I must say I LOVE Spinato's!  My family has been going here for years and will continue to do so.  But, I am giving the new Spinato's on 7th St only 4 stars for a few reasons:  1.  The bar and patio are great but, the dining area lacks the charm of the old Spinato's. I feel it looks similar to seating in a Denny's or cafeteria-style restaurant, not cozy, no charm! 2.  The new bread on the DaVinci is not as good. It's on too much bread and the bread is harder, which makes the sandwich difficult to eat. I now ask for it to be lightly toasted so the bread isn't too hard.  3.  I picked up a pizza last night and asked for 2 ranch dressings. I was charged $1.01 and received 2 tiny containers, each about 1/2 full with approx. 3/4 of a tablespoon of ranch.... Really?!?!  I found this to be grossly overcharging and disappointing and told the waiter my feelings. If you are going to charge for ranch, at least fill the tiny containers.  4.  I miss to-go cups!  I get food to go a lot and would love to get an ice tea or Pepsi with your fabulous pellet ice to enjoy with my meal.   These things excluded, I would give Spinato's 5 stars!  The Mama's Spinach and Super Six pizzas are my favorites, the spaghetti, meatball and ricotta calzone is a yummy masterpiece, the antipasti salad with their house Italian is a perfect starter and I LOVE the pellet ice (although you must request it if you are at the bar).  If you go at peak times, prepare to wait but, it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"This is not NY pizza in any way, shape or form. This is Chicago style, thin crust pizza according to the menu. I am not a huge fan of Chicago pizza, deep dish or thin crust, for me, it is more of an acquired taste, but it is good in a pinch depending on who is making it. Sometimes they go completely overboard on the cheese, and it is almost overwhelming, and then other times it is made just right with just enough cheese. The sauce is good, and their spaghetti calzones are hearty. I haven't tried any of their Italian dinners, but I will continue  to eat here because everything seems to be made fresh."}
{"text":"A perfectly prepared pizza. Delightful & courteous teenage wait staff. Pizza sauce was much more to my taste... slightly sweet! The crust was property baked and not blistered.  Well worth the 20 min wait!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight.  My husband ordered the individual pizza and I ordered the roast beef sandwich.  We waited a very long time with no food.  Finally asked the server to check after people who had arrived after we did had food and were almost finished eating.  It turned out that our order had been lost.  I understand that  any place can make a mistake from time to time.  Finally got our food after waiting an hour and 20 minutes.  My roast beef was cold....not just room temperature, but actually refrigerator cold.  I had asked for onions on the sandwich.  There was one almost undetectable piece of onion.  I couldn't eat the cold beef.  I was told they couldn't warm it up but would make me a new sandwich.  I had already waited an hour and a half.  I asked to speak to manager.  I was told that he was busy in the back on the computer!   They did comp the meal but not a great help as I left hungry.  They didn't offer to wrap it up so that I could heat it up at home.  We won't go back.  Ever!"}
{"text":"Have not enjoyed a good pizza in phx for a long time, last time was at least a decade ago at their Tempe location on Smith. We moved to the far east valley and just never got over there, we will be bringing our kids to this location so that them can also enjoy some great pizza."}
{"text":"I am transplant from Chicago where we know pizza like no one else and this place has the best pizza on the entire West Coast.  One bite and I knew immediately no other pie can compare, 2 thumbs way up!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My favorite is the Garlic Spinach pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! Yes, even better then Bianco's"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and they have the best gluten free pizza I've had. The GF bruschetta with the heirloom tomatoes was also really good."}
{"text":"Went here tonight around 8/830 with my boyfriend for the first time to see what the rave was about. From what I remember this was voted the best pizza in town so we decided to give it a try. The location itself is beautiful and the menu has a variety of options to chose from. We got the garlic bread with the marinara which was excellent. We also ordered the combo pizza which was okay, but not anything special. This place sits right between oreganos and Olive Garden in my book. For such a nice building I was surprised to receive a plastic cup and a paper napkin. The place was good but not enough to bring me back.   Our server was nice but never once checked in on us or offered anything else to us. We asked for the box, check and dessert menu and had to request her to put our order in. This place didn't do anything for me but I can say I've tried it."}
{"text":"The food is good but it hard to have a good take out with the way you are treated at the counter.   Rude and uncaring. They forgot my salad so they blamed the kitchen (don't you all work together)  then made me wait another 25 minutes. I asked if they could remake the pizzas and got a response as if I was robbing the place. The worst part was they just left the pizza on the counter for the 25 minutes so everyone else picking up their pizza was using them as a leaning post.   I won't be going back - I can get treated like crap anywhere and not have to pay high prices for it."}
{"text":"We drive a bit from the office to come here for lunch but it is worth the trip.  Service is warm, friendly and efficient.  I can't say enough about the folks that work here.  The Margherita pizza has such a delicious flavor, the tomato and basil on top is fresh and the thin crust is crisp and tasty.  I tried the thick crust once and enjoyed it too but the thin is my favorite.  I've tried the Greek pizza too and thought it was really good.  Spaghetti calzone with ricotta and marinara sauce is pure carb heaven.  They top the calzone with their sauce and it is a little on the sweet side.  I normally prefer a tangy or spicy sauce but unless you absolutely hate a sweeter sauce, you won't be disappointed.   The small easily serves 2 people.  Portions are good, prices are great, parking is great, but the neighborhood is a little run down and sketchy.  If you enjoy and are open to different types of pizza, don't skip Spinato's."}
{"text":"Spinato's: Now better at nickel and dime-ing you than most airlines!  I was super excited that Spinato's had moved closer to my neighborhood and happily walked there a few weeks after their re-opening.  The new location is gorgeous and the outdoor seating area looks nice too.  Our food was fine, pretty good in fact.  The meatball appetizer is tasty and the pizza came out quickly.  The big problem came when we were presented our bill.  I ordered a regular pizza off of the menu but asked for the onions to be removed.  I was surprised to see that I had been charged for a custom \"make your own\" pizza, which cost three dollars more than the pizza I had ordered.    The waitress shrugged off our complaint as \"that's our policy\" so I had to escalate to a manager.  The manager was very polite and apologetic but insisted that this was the owner's policy: Any time a change is made to a pizza it has to be priced out at a higher per-ingredient price.  I argued that it was completely illogical to charge me more for something that actually had less ingredients but he suggested it was because the kitchen staff need consistency when something is ordered (evidently you can't  have it your way here without paying handsomely).  Naturally this fact is not printed anywhere on the menu.  After much arguing and a million excuses the price was resolved to our satisfaction but I left with a bad flavor in my house...and not from the pizza.  In closing.  Spinato's has good food but be careful of what you order.  With Oregano's and Pizza Heaven right around the corner there are plenty of better, safer choices and that's where I will be spending my money next time."}
{"text":"My family and I love Spinato's.  We have been going there for years- and it is affordable! They have Good pizza and good calzones.  The services is pretty good overall and the servers we have had are always so kind! Decor is nice as well.  The pizza/pasta sauce is very sweet- which I like.  Some others may not like that and may want to consider different menu items."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here about half an hour before they closed, and there was no issue in picking up my order just before closing--I was happy about that! My food was delicious and everything was ready when I got there. I'll definitely be back to eat in the actual restaurant again soon. I'm always a Spinato's fan!"}
{"text":"I still love Spinato's (see: my other Spinato's reviews!) but had a weird experience at this location (it ended up fine for me, though!). Ordered takeout here on the way to a friend's house but there was a mixup when I got there: the hostess at the takeout window couldn't find my order. It turns out she gave it to another person by accident, and instead of sorting it out with me at the front, she disappeared for about 5-6 minutes and eventually came back to tell me she had called the lady who had my order, and that lady was driving back with my food........yikes.   The manager that night ended up coming out to sort it all out with me and the woman who drove the food back (who, for good reason, was in a VERY bad mood about the whole situation). My takeout order was comped immediately--thank you!--and I ended up also taking back the food the lady had driven back, since she brought it with her and the kitchen had also remade my order? Super bizarre, and I just felt weird and bad about the lack of communication and long gaps in not getting updates throughout the whole thing (overall, I was waiting there about 20 minutes with only one update from the hostess herself that whole time).   Anyway, the food was amazing, as always--I got the antipasti salad, a Get Meaty pizza, and an order of garlic bread, and my friend and I ended up with double the order because of the whole mixup. I'm sure I'll be back again soon, regardless of the earlier situation with the takeout mixup!"}
{"text":"Loooove this place. I first came here while in town on vacation with a friend. I was dying for a GOOD pizza (I'm from NY, and was living in south Texas at the time--not a \"real\" pizza to be found in south Texas anywhere!) and I was not disappointed. Since my first visit, I've moved to Phoenix and have been back many times to this and other Spinato's locations with friends.  I love the atmosphere of this location, and the servers have always been super friendly, prompt, and personable. The food has always been delicious--I'm a fan of the stuffed mushrooms and the Get Meaty or Chicago pizza. The roasted fennel and italian sausage pizza is definitely my favorite, though. Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong.  I also love the friendliness of the service here, as I mentioned earlier. The first time I visited, I was with a friend who had never had a cannoli before. We mentioned this jokingly to our server, and she told us she'd bring us one on the house--so nice of her! They ended up running out of the filling for it before we got our dessert, though, and instead, she brought us a tortine (their version of a ding dong). It was a really nice gesture and definitely made us want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around town!!! Seriously though I'm Italian and I'm extremely picky. Their tomato sauce is sweet and amazing. I recommend the Italian sausage and the cannoils! Outstanding service, very attentive. I highly recommend this place whenever you get pizza! Plus they deliver :D"}
{"text":"Well, today is not my day. I decided to give Spinatos another try. Knowing how busy they are, I went to the bar to place a to go order. Waited 5 minutes to get served, no big deal.  Ordered a drink and let the bartender know I wanted to place a to go order.  He said great and went to the POS system to set the order up, he came half way back and asked for the order. I gave him a simple first pizza order, half with olives half with none and add sausage. He keys it in and then goes and starts talking to another customer, then served another. Big problem, I had 2 other pizzas and a salad to order. This place is the last place to visit on a Friday or Saturday evening. They are too busy to show simple respect to customers who are willing to pay their over inflated prices for a sweet style pizza. I talked to the manager who listened and wanted to comp something. They just don't get it, but they try. Avoid this place when it's busy, simple as that."}
{"text":"I was pumped to try Spinatos, I've been wanting to get there for years but just hadn't made it happen. Finally got there this past weekend.   Everything was great except one thing, hooolllllllyyyyy cow this sauce is sweet.  Now I must admit, I read plenty of reviews and knew it was going to be on the sweet side.  I very much prefer a salty, spicier sauce like Rosatis, Oreganos etc. but wanted to venture out a bit.  Well, it was just way too sweet, the only reason I kept eating was the fantastic crust and the quality of the toppings.  I cannot complain there at all.  Service was great, decor wonderful.  If you like sweet sauce, and I mean sugary sweet, this is your pizza!"}
{"text":"When I have a coupon or deal, I like to double check to make sure they'll still honor it. I had to ask three people here if they would honor it no one knew and no one offered to find out. Food was fine but the sauce is very sweet. Not what I expected. Booths were large enough to be comfortable."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza's I have ever had.    I loved it because it is different from the heavy red sauce and cheese.   The taste of the Roasted Fennel and Sausage came through with the awesome crusty crust!!!!  Our trips to the pizza restaurants are few and far between but this one came highly recommended by my brother in law who was playing in a softball tourney in Fountain Hills and a man on the team knew of the place. When we arrived they told us it would be a 25 minute wait but it did not take that long.   Employees are very friendly and attentive.   Our waitress didn't bring us the right change (she gave me more back that I should have) so when I asked her she said she rounded it up because she didn't have coins.   I loved that so gave the girl a big tip.     We will definitely be going back to this place when we are in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service here.  They are a key player on our take out rotation.  We like do do a half Lil' Italiana and a Half Get Meaty but sub the Canadian bacon with meatballs.  Omnom"}
{"text":"Guess who works here?!?!...Encyclopedia Brown!  Even more amazing, he hasn't aged one bit since the 80's, however, he is in disguise. So how'd I realize who he was?...  It was a Friday evening around 5:45pm, May 27, to be exact. After being on hold for 23 minutes...no exaggeration (I looked at my phone when I hung up and subtracted a couple of min)...I finally got a hold of a person. I simply asked, does your gluten free pizza have egg as an ingredient, and Mr. Brown's response was yes. To confirm I then asked again, so the gluten free pizza does have egg, to which Mr. Brown said yes! (With no hesitation..he does know everything).   By chance, my wife was getting frustrated with the wait and pulled up their gluten free menu online, and guess what?!  It said he gluten free pizza actually does NOT have egg as an ingredient. She called back, of course Mr. Brown answered, and he admitted he just said yes and didn't know whether the gluten free pizza had egg. It turns out the gluten free menu online was correct and there isn't egg in their gluten free pizza. Close one...we probably would have never gone then.   So we went and got a picture of Mr. Brown in action. Turns out, not only does he pretend to know everything, I believe he keeps people on hold for 20+ min for no reason (as they definitely weren't that busy). But that's just my opinion, and I wasn't there obviously when I called.   For everyone's reference if you are seeking an autograph, I've included a picture of Mr Encyclopedia Brown in this review.   PS ask about the egg in the gluten free pizza...ha!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service. They brought it right to our hotel and we're super friendly.  Loved the garlic bread too!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Pizza Ever!!!!! Only down fall is there service is really slow here but if you have celiacs disease or gluten intolerance this is the place to go! YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"For a place that puts such care into their pizza, i will never understand why they would lax on their quality when it comes to sandwiches.  Being from Chicago, i tend to be critical of Pizza, but i actually really enjoy Spinatos.  The crust is good, and they use fresh ingredients and creative combinations that make it very good.    Where i was greatly disappointed was in the quality of their sandwiches.  I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and was very surprised to see that the chicken was clearly from a freezer variety breast that we can all find at Costco or anywhere else.  This was disheartening, given the fact that the bread was soft on the inside and crusty on the outside, and all the other ingredients were spot on.  Why would they risk everything by cutting corners on their meats?  Made me wonder, how many other ingredients originate in a freezer box.    As Gordon Ramsey would say..... They probably spend more time and energy freezing, thawing, and recooking this chicken then they would with fresh product.    I am afraid to try the Italian Beef, as this is another Chicago Original that i would demand nothing less then perfection on. My recommendation to the owners is to ditch the freezer... Make all original, all fresh ingredients.  People can tell the difference."}
{"text":"Damn!  I have had it twice. It gets better each time.  Great sauce and crust.  Sausage and onion was the way to go.  Good hot and fresh, cold, or reheated the next day.  One of the best in Phoenix easily."}
{"text":"This place is very very pizza. Luckily for us we ordered takeout. They said about 30 minutes for the large pizza and bread sticks I ordered. We arrived at exactly 30 minutes (I was commuting from north scottsdale) and it was all ready and in their take out heating thing.   I likes the fact that there was a completely separate area for the take out patrons (you don't enter into the main dining entrance).   The large pizza is huge. I deep dish pizza is definitely a must try for all you bread lovers out there. We ordered Nicole's special and it was delicious.   Only 4 stars because it is a little spendy and expect a wait for about 30 minutes for any takeout."}
{"text":"This is top-notch pizza. Easily one of the three best pizza joints I've eaten at in my life.   The sauce has a sweet and unique flavor that perfectly compliments the rest of the pizza. I've been here at least 20 times, but I usually can only bring myself to order just a standard pepperoni pizza or the Mamma's Signature pizza (spinach,garlic, and cheese) because they are that good. Eventually I'll have enough courage to branch out and try something new on the menu.    The only disappointment I've ever experienced was when I ordered the margherita pizza a few months ago. Everything else is perfect. Also of note -- Spinato's is a little pricier than average, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The first time I took a bite of Spinato's pizza my life changed. The sauce is sweet and so good. We usually get a large 16-inch, 3 topping pie for takeout at just under $21. Pretty reasonable for ulta-super bomb pizza."}
{"text":"Wife and I visited Spinato's this past Sat. No doubt, the gluten-free pizza is probably the best in town. However, I was lured into the Calzone with the spaghetti inside. It was AWFUL unless, of course, you like a bunch of pizza crust with nothing but cold spaghetti inside. On the menu, it is graphically described \"with meatballs.\" In reality, there is a weighed-out portion of 1 oz of meat inside according to the manager who, incidentally, refunded my $ on the calzone. 1 oz of meat equals about 1/2 teaspoonful. Stay with their pizza which is great. Avoid the Calzone."}
{"text":"Not good.  We wanted to leave our leftovers on the table!  Sauce was way too sweet and crust was way too chewy. Definitely not going back!"}
{"text":"I rate three basic things in every restaurant: service, food and ambiance. I give Spinato's a full score under every category.  1. Service was very nice. Waitress was very knowledgable and give good suggestions.   2. Food was way better than what we expected. It was hands down the best pizza we have eaten in Phoenix.  And again it goes to waitress knowledge and help. She suggested what size pizza to order. We decided to order large pizza but she suggested two small pizzas as they were on a happy hour special price.  In that way we got more pizza for price and more variety as we ordered two different pizzas.  3. Ambiance was very nice. We decided to sit on their patio and it was perfect for an early spring evening in phoenix.   4.  Price not bad at all.  I recommend this restaurant in every way."}
{"text":"Very nice service, great locals spot!  Incredible bruschetta, delish spaghetti, and the house salad was excellent!  A great spot!"}
{"text":"We arrived a little after 6 on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  It was also very soon after this location opened.  Although we were told we had a 30 - 35 minute wait, we waited over an hour.  There were 7 of us, however.  We have long been fans of Spinato's pizzas.  They have been our go-to, locally-owned pizzeria.  The remodel of this outdated building is great.  They really did a fabulous job with the design.  The patio with fireplace is great.  We also enjoyed the expanded menu.  Prices are still reasonable, and the service was perfect."}
{"text":"Needed delivery, was recommended this place. We got 2 pepperoni & sausage pizzas and it was everything it should be. It took less than 45 min and the driver was friendly. It was around 40$ and we devoured them.  Thanks for making great pizza..."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!  We have been coming to this spinatos for over 6 years and we LOVE it!  Everything about Spinatos is incredible - food, staff, service, atmosphere, and did I say FOOD? The food is amazing, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The Chicago pizza is so delicious.  The prices are great and they do daily specials.  We go with our best friends on Wednesdays because it is 1/2 off a bottle of wine and they have some delicious choices - the cara Mia is a nice Pinot they have.  We love it when Rob is our server he is super fun and always makes us feel like family, very attentive and a great server all around, ask to be seated in robs section and you won't be disappointed. another great server is Maria but she is only there once a week I believe, very nice lady!    Spinatos has a sweet sauce unlike anything I've ever tasted it definitely makes the pizza.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, the food was great! They also have fast and very friendly service.. Not to mention the amazing prices !"}
{"text":"I know of you look at my stats, you'll say this guy must be getting paid to give 5 freaking stars..... But people this pizza joint will get you high like John Legend \"So High\".   The atmosphere is really nice, you have family's, friends, couples and folks who just want to hang at the bar; Spinato's takes em all.  The restaurant is very clean and the customer service is top notch. The have ample parking and outdoor seating that is misted very well.   The pizza is banging, every kind I've tried here is great and they serve the pizza up at the right temperature hot but not burn the roof of your mouth hot. I always go thin crust, but I'm sure the other stuff is good too. The have ample drinks to wash down your meal and quench your thirst. Your pockets won't hurt too bad coming here unless you like their drinks and you wild out on them."}
{"text":"I tried the Toasted Da Vinci sandwich yesterday and it was outstanding. One of the best sub sandwiches in town. Toasted bun, warm but not too hot, and delicious meat and cheese. I have many friends who worship Spinato's and now I know why.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Ate here over the weekend, we beat the dinner rush but we got very personal service, the pizza was delicious (I especially enjoyed the sauce). Our server even gave the baby a T-shirt for free! Definitely will be going back.  One Nibble, everyone knows the laws, we try them all until we've had them all! 6.8 in the score, big fan of the tangy sauce, not a fan of the way the pizza is sliced, and I like a New York style crust which this doesn't have. If you like thin crust, hit this place up, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place, we love the sauce that they use. They treat you like family, the service is always with a smile.  One Nibble, everyone knows the laws, we try them all until we've had them all! Grade on the pizza, unconventional cut, I like mine New York Style, big fan of the tangy sauce, crust is a bit thin for my liking (6.8)"}
{"text":"I eat here on occasion and consistently very good food and service. Be prepared to wait 30 or so minutes as this place is popular, and rightly so.  There's a new menu so if you haven't eaten here in a while check it out. Also, I bought a jar of sauce to take home so we'll see if its as good as the fresh."}
{"text":"I've had the Mamma's Calzone and a couple different pizzas at least 10 times. The pizzas are great! But the Calzone is absolutely AMAZING! I have never had such great food.  The service has always been decent. But in fact, the service could even be terrible and I would still probably give it 5 stars since the food is so amazing!  My kids like the spaghetti, but I've never tried it. (How can you mess up spaghetti anyway?). I've only tried the vegetarian pizza, spinach pizza and the Mamma's calazone... So I'm not sure how the rest of the food is, but the dishes above are absolutely incredible.  Oh, good price too!"}
{"text":"Went here with group of friends for dinner.  Waited for a long long time - 90 min.  (granted. my fault not making a reservation).  I cant say it for my friends, but I feel it was worth the wait.  I wanted to try this place because it says its the best pizza in arizona.  Two pizzas I enjoyed the most were Combo and Mama Spinato's pizza.  Right in the middle between soft and crunchy, just right amount of cheese, and savory taste.  Service was great even though we were eating at the balcony.  Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizza is great... Our favorites are the Spicy Italian (with jalapeños) and Nicole's New Favorite.  Their cannoli is also delicious!  So happy Spinatos made it to Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Ok we came here after going to the location in PHX 2 weeks ago. We had a cheese pizza for the kids and a chicken cheese pizza. The pizzas were just as good as our last experience! I am only giving 4 stars because they do not have chicken wings or the ding dongs!! Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. I went there with a friend, granted we went on a Friday, but we waited 45 minutes, when we were told it would be 25-35 minutes for a table, only to be told we should probably just order at the bar. I would hesitate to dine in again, and this was in the new location, which has easily triple the seating of the old one."}
{"text":"By far this is the best pizza around! From the first time we went we were hooked. Their gluten free pizza is the best in the state :) Ask for Brandon to serve you if he is around. Guaranteed good time!"}
{"text":"Jennifer was fantastic!! Great service and the best pizza we've ever had!! Love spinatos"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza place! We go here at least twice a month for our pizza fix.  They have gluten-free crust that doesn't taste like cardboard (win!) and reasonable prices.  I love their house dressing and tomato sauce. So much so that I often buy jars of the former to use when we make pasta or pizza at home!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Great Service.  We've been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new...this place was awesome!!!  We started with the cheese bread, slightly cold by awesome flavor!  Pizza sauce is slightly sweet and amazing!!  My sister got a dinner salad with their homemade garlic ranch, it was good.  My husband got the meatball sub --amazing!!  My sister and I tried the classic crust Chicago pizza with pepperoni added--omg delicious!!!  We ended the night with the special dessert, red velvet ding gong.  This thing had the hardest shell ever but again we were impressed!    I love pizza, this is one of the top fives for sure!!  We will be back again...if you haven't tried it you need to!!  This place does it right!"}
{"text":"Came at lunch time and it was super busy. The wait was 45 minutes but we got got seated sooner. When I first arrived one of the bathroom stalls had no toilet paper. I didn't say anything because usually places like these do bathroom checks every 45mins-a hour. I went to use the bathroom again over a hour the same stall still did not have any toilet paper. I told the host when we left. Now here we go with the drinks and food. I had the mojitos and they were yummy. We had order a salad and while eating the salad myself and my friend felt a big crunch and noticed there was small pieces of rock in the salad! We told the waiter and showed it to him and he left. We never got an apology and they even charged us for the salad! We found a manager and they comp the rock salad but we were surprised that when we originally showed our waiter the rocks we didn't get a simple apology. Now the pizza was BOMB!! We had the Greek and Six pizza. I would recommend this place for the pizza but not for the salad or slow service."}
{"text":"There was about a thirty minute wait when we went there Friday night around 7:30. But we weren't in a rush so we didn't mind. There's a little bar in the entrance in case you want to sip on a drink while waiting.   Once we were seated, we ordered the thick crust mama spinatos pizza and halved it with spicy Italian. We got the garlic cheesy bread. Both the appetizer and the pizza were delicious! We got the medium sized pizza which was really big for just the two of us so we had a lot to take home.   The waiter was wonderful. The food was wonderful. And the environment was great. Would def go back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Tried the thin crust Super Six and a create your own with meatballs; both were very good."}
{"text":"Service was just OK (slow to get our drinks and refills weren't offered), but the pizza was fabulous! We enjoyed a specialty  pizza (roasted fennel and italian sausage) - the balsamic glaze over the asiago and mozzarella cheese sent my taste buds over the top!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I was disappointed.  The pizza was mediocre at best and the atmosphere reminded me of an upscale McDonalds.  If you're a fan of Applebee's or Chili's then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place has great food and fast service. Want pizza come on over. Salad was better than most. Good beer selection. Will be back next time in town. Thank you for awsum service at a great price."}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute wait, so we decided to order from the to-go section next door. There was a table right out front, so our party of four just sat and waited there. They provided us with glasses of water while we waited. Our pizza was ready 30 minutes later and we just ate at the table out front. The pizza was delicious. All-in-all, not a bad 45 minute visit that would have taken much longer if we would have actually waited to sit and order from a waitress."}
{"text":"Awesome pie.... I ordered a medium pepp. and sausage..... Paid 16.46, and it was well worth it...Good thin crust....They don't skimp on items.......Sauce is a little sweet, but it works nice with all the sodium....:) Very tasty, and definitely in my top 3 pizza places for Az.........Good job Spinatos!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza delivery half Chicago and half Italiano, although it tooks in total 1 hour , they told us in advance so we were ready to wait. The delivery girl was friendly. The pizza was delicious, but a little pricey - its expensive when you add $5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza"}
{"text":"We were introduced to Spinato's a few months back and have visited several times.  Consistency is the key and they have it all.  Customer Service, Freshness, food quality, price, environment. We have so many favorites, but we always get the meatball appetizer, ceasar salad and thin crust pizza.  It's very hard to deviate from those items. We have had other items and all are fantastic. Visit today!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great warm and friendly service!  What really impressed my wife was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It was completely dust free, not on the fan blades, picture frames, etc.  This is a winning combination, great food and clean"}
{"text":"We love the food at Spinatos, especially the spaghetti calzone. However, we went here today to celebrate a birthday lunch and the service was absolutely terrible! I tried to secretly order a birthday treat for a birthday surprise. The naive hostess sent us a cannoli (we would have preferred cake.) Then the server announced it long before it arrived so it wasn't a surprise at all. To top it all off, I was charged for a cannoli which I never would have actually ordered! The other disaster, I ordered my spaghetti calzone with the sauce on the side and the server refused to accommodate this simple request! He insisted, \"that's how you get it to go.\" The serving is rather large so we ended up taking about 3/4 of it to go and now it's a soggy mess. Spinatos, while delicious, is hardly a bargain, so it's upsetting that we had such lousy service. Everyone was friendly but they should be considerably more accommodating to customer requests. Why would it have been such a big deal to bring the sauce on the side, like I wanted?"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner, about 10 minutes before happy Hour ended. Had to go to host to get service. Finally Got a server, food was wonderful, service so good. Had to ask a different server to refill our water glasses. The service put a damper on some great food. We shared a pizza and a friend had spaghetti."}
{"text":"I have been to and ordered from the Tempe Spinato's quite a few times, and I am a fan of the signature pizza. I visited this location today for an office baby shower. We had a group of about 10 and the service was excellent. Our server was fantastic she was very quick with our orders and to refill our drinks. She was very accommodating with our requests for sides of dressing, lemons and extra marinara. She even took the onions off a sandwich because the side salad was ordered without onions. The food was great; I went with the signature calzone, YUM! Everyone really enjoyed their food. Our servers brought extra plates and forks for our shower cake and even offered to wrap up the extra cake for us to take back! I wish I remember her name to give her kudos. She went above and beyond to accommodate and make our experience the best possible. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"They can get busy, so be ready for a bit of wait.  I've previously visited the Tempe location, and was pleased, so I came to try this one.  During my second visit, I ordered polenta fries and a small veggie pizza to share for two people. The polenta fries portion was huge! It paired nicely with the pesto dipping sauce. the veggie pizza was really good, but not as good as the chicken pesto pizza I had before.  I was pleasantly surprised with the bill. It came out to be $14, and we couldn't even finish all the food between 2 people!  Definitely worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley.  And their spaghetti and meatballs with their marinara are really top notch.  This location suffers from north Scottsdale snobbery from the customers and staff, but the food overcomes it.  If you want friendly service as well, visit their 16th street and bell location.  But just order takeout and be on your way.  So worth it."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food the service the ambience. Best pizza I've ever had and I've had a lot of pizza."}
{"text":"I was given a free pizza as a result of the pepper stems repeatedly being left on and horrible to bite in to.  So I get my pizza home and yes, they did exactly what they compensated me for,,, very frustrating!"}
{"text":"Wednesday, long day at work.  Wanted to relax,  Wife wanted to go to Spinatos.  Friendly people,  We ordered mamas Salid  and a Chicago pizza. Oh ya, half price on a  bottle wine night.  All I can say. BAM!  So good!  Now that's the way you end a long day!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in town. Sauce is a bit on the sweet side, which is delicious and unlike other pizzas you'll taste. Staff is always friendly and there's plenty of room in this place so wait times are not that bad. I'd recommend Spinato's to anyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Love the sauce. And those dang canolis!  Always come back for more. Great service great pies."}
{"text":"Good gluten free pizza and bread sticks. The take out section is separate from the main restaurant which made carry out easy"}
{"text":"Well this is the second time we have tried this restaurant.  The first we had a large group so we chalked up the fact that the service was slow ( they actually forgot our daughters meal all together.  They apologized and gave her a free dessert (cake) that was frozen solid. ) to that fact.   We decided to give it another try,  not much has changed a service was slow this time they remembered her meal but it was completely wrong.  I feel bad I really wanted to like this place but I just can't bring myself to do it again."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on Friday.  We were greeted warmly and seated quickly.  We had already looked at the menu earlier and we were ready to order right away.  We got a \"get meaty\" signature personal pizza, cheesy garlic bread and the trio of meat balls.  The garlic cheesy bread was good but I didn't taste any garlic at all. I specifically ordered this because I love garlic anything! I was really disappointed.  The meat balls were good.  When we got the pizza, I was expecting what was advertised. A Chicago style pizza. Yummy crust! The pizza was not what I expected. It was pretty much flat bread with sauce cheese and toppings. I would have been better off going to Barros.  One thing I can say is the service was polite, and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. I suggest rewording the descriptions of their items though. It should be cheesy bread and flat bread (no crust) pizza."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best pizza I've had since moving to Arizona in 2011. I'm telling you... this stuff is like crack. Trust me. Pay the extra couple bucks for for a large pie - it's about $20. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The hostess and waitress were extremely young, but efficient and personable. Kudos to them and their manager for teaching them the value of sincerity. I had the calzone while my four dinner friends each had the pizza. Overall we enjoyed the meals and the presentation. Being an aficionado of Italian food and recognizing the importance of a good marinara I found the sauce to be a little sweet. If you are using good tomatoes the sweetness is within. I always question the automatic addition of sugar. It was still a nice dinner with friends and I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to other Spinatos restaurants and never had this problem before no service for 15 minutes and the hostess ignored my party on several occasions"}
{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised!   After reading so many reviews we had some mixed feelings and we were caught off guard when the guests that sat next to us made a complaint about the pizza. They said some off putting remarks about the sauce and returned their pizza. The server quickly offered to address the problem and was beyond accommodating. Yes we were watching and eavesdropping lol.   Anyways it turned us off and instead of walking out we decided to try smaller portions of the menu items. We ordered a personal Chicago pizza, The Greek Salad and dessert. The Seasonal Seranata which is a Baked Crostata with Gelato.   I will say that the personal pizza is the cutest thing ever but not to share! It was great to have a taste and although the server warned us about the size and how sweet the sauce was we we're pleasantly surprised!   I had a slice and the sauce was perfect! Sweet but not overbearing and you could taste the herbal spices, almost necessary with the toppings and types of crust. After another slice, I really enjoyed it and wished we had ordered a bigger Pizza. Don't let the negative reviews fool you and just ask for a side of sauce to taste.   The salad portions are generous and the dessert was perfect. The homemade Crostata hit the spot since we had space for dessert. I will def be back to try their other specialties!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to for pizza.  Still love Barro's but they don't deliver to our area so we tried Spinato's.  VERY happy we did.  The pizza is really good, and deliveries are always quicker than they quote."}
{"text":"Two words. Spaghetti. Calzone. You'll thank me later! Opt for meatballs and ricotta! The pizza/spaghetti sauce is slightly sweet. Love it.  We also get the specialty spinach pizza-lots of garlic, lots of flavor. This place is small and gets busy. Kinda have to plan ahead when ordering for takeout at peak hours or when dinning too. One of the places we regular"}
{"text":"I thought I got the spicy italian pizza with pepperoni, red onions, Italian meatballs and mozzarella cheese  but it was so sweet it didn't taste like pizza and not very spicy, I did eat it all though but my wife hated it and made me drop it's rating to 2 stars. I thought it might push a 3 but we won't  be back ever!"}
{"text":"Great cozy environment. Loved the hot wings, and the portions were huge. I didn't love their thicker crust pizza, but willing to come back and give their thin crust a try. There was something off about the dough that I didn't love (it seemed a little undercooked), so I can imagine their thin crust might taste better."}
{"text":"I'm about to say something BIG!  I have found the best pizza ever! Yep, that's right...  *Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach Pizza*  (See Pic)  I literally dream about this damn thing. It is heavy on the garlic so plan ahead. I can't even describe the flavor, but it is out of this world. I have only had the personal size, but I'm sure the bigger sizes are just as good if not better.  I have come in here for lunch between meetings and sitting in the bar is a great spot to people watch. This location also has a great private room for meetings, its actually quiet and they are hooking up the appropriate media. I WILL be booking meetings here just so I can have this pizza.  Go try this pizza...TRUST ME!"}
{"text":"We have been going to and or getting delivery for a very long time. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs tonight. Horrible!!!  Dry and stuck together with little sauce. Bread stale and hard. Have noticed a decline of late in quality with pizzas ad well. This is the third time we have been disappointed and have given up ."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's rehearsal dinner here and everything was great. She was having a gender reveal party  Saturday so of course we decided to order pizza from Spinato's.  We originally ordered 8 pizzas to be delivered, but unfortunately several guests at the last minute called to cancel. Spinato's let me modify my order without any hassles.  Delivery was right on time and even though we went outside to help carry in the pizza, our delivery driver carried it all in for us and even set it up.  Fantastic customer service!  How was the pizza you are wondering - hot, fresh and absolutely DELICIOUS!  Thank you Spinato's for making our reveal such a success!  In case you are wondering, the baby is a girl - yeah!"}
{"text":"So so good. Favorite pizza place in town. Chicago style thin crust, square slices, sweet sauce. Delicious."}
{"text":"The good: The restaurant is still pretty new and looks fantastic.  They have a dedicated takeout area, so you don't get that awkward \"go to the bar\" issue with the hostess and bar tender.  Their chicken parm and baked spaghetti are good, as are their meatballs and pizza.  Be warned that the pizza is VERY heavy, and not the lighter, fluffy/chewy fare found at Sauce, North, or Federal.  I'd put it more along the lines of Pat's Sicilian, Uno's, or similar \"deep dish\" or \"pan\" pizzas that are fully loaded up with sauce, cheese, and toppings.  The bad: They removed their gigantic, delicious, affordable, perfectly toasted chicken parm sandwich.  That alone is taking them from 4 to 3 stars.  If you're looking for something lighter here, you really have very few options.  The ugly: The golden bbq wings were the most disgusting chicken I've ever tasted in my entire life.  I wish the description said they were basically mustard and nothing else.  Thankfully the server swapped them out for an order of meatballs.  The seafood pasta was also disappointing, with the vodka sauce being pretty weak and the noodles all sticking together in a giant clump.  I've also received good service here.  The chocolate chip cookies sold at the market/takeout area are pretty good, but a little bit too close to well-baked (not chewy/soft) Nestle Tollhouse for me to buy them for myself.  Oh, and the parking situation is FANTASTIC due to them sharing Bashas' huge lot!"}
{"text":"Probably my biggest mistake was going here and not eating their specialty, which is pizza, but went here for a work lunch. I got the lentil rosemary soup, which was flavorless and had hardly any lentils.  They tout themselves for making homemade soup, but I could have easily made a more flavorful and filling soup at home. For my entree I ordered the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad with added chicken.  The server forgot the chicken and when it was brought, it was not real chicken breast, but the formed chicken frozen from a bag.  Super salty and cold.    The service was not slow, but everyone at the table commented on how angry and rude the server behaved.  Clint seemed so unhappy to be there and it really showed.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"Spinato's ROCKS, it is the BEST!!  My first choice for over 30 thirty years.  Always the Super Six, LOVE the sweet sauce and sweet sausage in there.  This time, tried something new with my friend Sandra P.  Let me tell you, I have a new favorite and it is called NICOLE's NEW FAVORITE.  Piles of Pepperoni, mozza AND feta with fresh basil confetti-ed over it.  Masterpiece!!  If I could, I would marry it and I'm not the marrying kind.....back soon and can't wait to tell my whole dedicated, loyal Spinato's eating family about this great new taste sensation.  A++++++"}
{"text":"Crust, crust,crust was a bust.thin yes but no crunch to it. The cheese , sausage  and sauce was very tastey. Had a antipasta salad..just ok at best.. If you are looking for a crispy crust not here.."}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful.  The hostess folks were very confused about handling three couples and were not taking names. Can't imagine what it is like when it is crowded. The pizza was good and since they dropped some on the way to the table they made us a personal pizza to go to make up for it. Unfortunately when we went to eat the leftovers the next day we discovered they put the wrong toppings on it!   The stuffed mushrooms were not very good. Fortunately we only ordered the half order special. Salad was tasty but the serving bowl was taken away by the busboy before we finished it.  Not likely we will go back again unless someone we know is partial to them."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday lunch with some co-workers.  We had the trio of meatballs for an appetizer and they were delicious.  I got the spicy Italian pizza and it was good, but I honestly did not care of the pizza sauce.  It was very sweet and I was hoping for more traditional marinara.  I would be back but not to have pizza, maybe try a pasta."}
{"text":"Only pizza I will eat! Sauce is amazing and they are not skimpy on the toppings at all! Happy Hour has some great deals as well! Service is always great I highly recommend going out to eat there!"}
{"text":"OMG the greatest pizza ever! My favorite pizza spot for a custom thin crust perfecto pie! The facility is beautiful and the drinks are great . Too bad they have Pepsi and not Coke!"}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza and salads. All I can say is 'excellent'. You are really missing out if you don't try their pizza.  Love it."}
{"text":"Spinato's is one of my fav places. The service was excellent last week when we went with some friends from out of town, and they loved having our baby girl too and gave her a little shirt to wear. The food was vaporized in no time! I recommend trying their gluten free pizza. It really doesn't taste any different than other pizas I've had before. Really a top notch place. PLEASE check them out. Prices aren't too bad either and I can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Thrilled to have good pizza and calzones in the local area.  So far we have not been disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Most people come here for the pizza and most either like it or they don't because they think the sauce is too sweet.  Some of their other dishes are pretty good.  We've enjoyed their salads and sandwiches.    Sometimes the service could be better. We have had to wait a little too long for our food to come out.  And we have eaten in the bar area where its much too noisy.  Sound seems to echo off the walls.  Should children under 12 be eating in the bar area?"}
{"text":"We came in tonight for my daughter's birthday dinner and it was once again awesome! Our waiter was awesome but can't remember his name and my daughter even got a cannoli for her birthday. Will just have to keep coming back for this awesome food!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from Cali and wanted to try local pizza instead of the typical chains.  We called in and the wait for delivery was and hour and a half so we opted to pick up 45 min. I got the   MAMMA SPINATO'S \"SIGNATURE\" FRESH SPINACH fresh spinach, our secret spice blend, tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella  I read the menu and this looked good. I saw that spinach on build your own counted as two items so figured it would have tons, NOT It was chopped so small you could hardly find it. The garlic was there for sure but was quite bitter don't think it was cooked I prefer it at least sauteed a bit. The cheese like the spinach non existent and I don't like tons but please some would be nice. Now to the crust, I chose the Sicilian style a I am not a fan of thin. It was tough, dry and tasteless. The sauce was so sweet it gagged me. Sorry to say this will not be our place . On the hunt for something new."}
{"text":"this might be one of my new favorite pizza this place is just impressing walking in the front door love the decor the bar area is huge the bar itself has to be 15 feet long great selection of beers and wines had two pizzas the hand-tossed or thin crust and there Sicilian the thin crust was amazing we had the Mediterranean I think the name spinach peppercinis onions feta cheese butter sauce really good it was very sweet I like sauce on the sweeter side some people may not like it though now the Sicilian didn't really care tasted like a stale breadstick with ketchup on top also had a salad very tasteless definitely would not order again service was average our server though for some reason was in a big hurry seem like trying to push us out who was at 11 o'clock in the morning and no one was in there so I'm not sure why that was normally I would have gave this place a 4-star but since that pizza was so delicious they got the 5 definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Spaghetti & Meatball Calzone.  I know NOTHING else of what they have there.  We've been going there for years now and the ONLY thing I've ever had was the Spaghetti & Meatball Calzone.  SOOOOOOOOOO good!"}
{"text":"I HATE leaving 3 stars because our service was SOOOO exceptional!!  However I was not a fan of the sauce this evening...it seemed a little sweet but my wife and daughter thought everything was fine.  I know everyone has a different palate for pizza...I, myself, am a LITTLE biased coming from the NY area....HOWEVER, with that being said, I have enjoyed Spinato's in the past and tonight just seemed to be just a bit different.  My wife glared at me as I made my comments to our beautiful young waitress and she was VERY receptive and apologetic, offering a manager but we declined.  This will not deter us from coming back because it is a favorite of my wife's...and you know, a happy wife-happy life!  So give them a shot and probably prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"Just visited Spinatos in Phoenix for lunch.  Excellent personal pizza! Arrived in a timely fashion and it tasted fabulous! The place is clean and the patio is super cool.  Now this would not be a BR review without discussing my favorite topic....customer service.  This place didn't disappoint.  From the hostess to the waitress (Melanie), I was met with a smile and positive outlook. Can't rave enough about how pleasant these people were.  Thank you and I will be recommending this spot to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  Just ate dinner there on 04/25/15 for the appetizer we weren't sure what to order. The waitress recommended the medium wings she said they are her favorite. I beg to differ. Not the best wings I have had.   But let me tell you! \"Da'Greek\" pizza! Is so GOOD! I was very impressed. That best pizza I've had in awhile.  For the little ones I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with marinara & they loved it! Ate the whole dish! And they are somewhat picky of their food. The kids meal also came with a drink and gelato!   Our whole meal only cost us $23! Not too shabby! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from this location today for a team meeting at my home office.  The customer service was excellent!  I'm actually from out of town and unfamiliar with this area, but the young lady who answered the phone was able to pull up my office location (which I couldn't remember the address of) and even a previous order to assist me in placing my own order.  She also remembered to include things like plates, silverware and napkins.  It was an easy, streamlined process with a very friendly voice on the other end of the phone.  The delivery driver was on time, called as he was nearing the building and even relocated his car when I realized I'd sent him to the wrong door.  Again, super friendly and he made sure all of my lunch needs were met.  In addition, the pizza and salads were great!  I definitely recommend doing business with them."}
{"text":"I have been to Spinato's quite a few times.  The most recent was ordering take out pizza a few days ago.  I ordered a large pizza with Canadian bacon and pepperoni plus a side salad.  The small side salad was $3.50 for basically a small amount of lettuce but the pizza is so amazing that I won't even complain about the lame salad.  The pizza sauce is like no other. It is sweet and wonderful and I crave it. I even love how they cut the pizza into squares.  For some reason the squares make it even more appetizing.  The pizza is so rich and filling and I want to keep eating it just to taste the amazing sauce but I get too full, so I save it for the next day and it still tastes good. I forgot to say that I love the Spinato's balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing. I even went to buy it at Sprouts so I could use it at home. I would highly recommend this place.   It's one of my all time faves."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends and it wasn't all that busy. Sat down, got our drinks, and took a look at the menu. Everything in the menu sounded delicious! My friends both got the chicken parmesan and I got a chicken alfredo which was not on the menu but they were happy to make it. After a long wait about 45 min our food finally came out; I repeat the place wasn't very busy maybe about 3 other tables were occupied. Other than that I do have to say the food was worth the wait; pasta had great flavor and perfectly cooked chicken. It was kind of odd to me that the linguini they used for my dish was thin, almost like spaghetti thin, but still good in every way. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. I came for a networking event, and I as thoroughly impressed. The service was great, as well as the ambience, but what impressed me the most were all of the gluten free options. I have been gluten free for over 10 years, and this was the first time I had been in an Italian restaurant with gluten free bread!!!  I ended up ordering the baked artichoke crostini appetizer, and it was incredible. Way too much food for one person, so I boxed it up and ended up eating my left over for dinner.   My only complaint is that they do not offer a gf pizza crust option, nor do they offer gf pasta."}
{"text":"Spinatos has a seating section for every vibe you are looking for. They have a dimly lit dining hall, a seperate brightly lit dining area, and then a bar area with booths, tables, bar seating, and Tv's, as well as outdoor seating.  They have a menu that I would expect to find at a pizzeria: pizza (duh), salad, sandwiches, and appetizers. I opted for a glass of rosé, shared bruschetta, and shared a greek salad. My hunny had a personal size pizza. It's probably a good time to mention they have 4 different sized pizzas to choose from.  We came in at around 7:30pm on a Friday. We had good service and were seated immediately. The bruschetta was delicious. They were huge, crunchy pieces of bread. The Greek salad was amazing.  There was ample parking outside and it's hard to miss the restaurant on the corner of the intersection. And bonus - they have half price bottles of wine for Wine Wednesdays!!   They will probably see me again on Wednesday.."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 3 1/2 stars. This place is amazing!!! I got a recommendation because I'm from California. I wish this place was by my house. Highly recommended. We had the Chicken Pesto pizza and Chicken Masala."}
{"text":"I've given it a couple tries and service is worse and worse. Some good food but not worth it anymore"}
{"text":"First time trying out the new local pizza restaurant. My daughter is the pizza expert so we ordered a cheese and sausage pizza. We had been ordering from NYPD for years because we like thin crust. Overall the sausage was tasty. The sauce was light. The cheese was really good. They delivered in a timely friendly manner. Will go there again. Next time I will dine in. It looked nice inside when I peeked in once."}
{"text":"Love this place the pizza is excellent, the service is top notch. The employees also make me feel like family."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Wanted to have my birthday dinner tonight.   My folks got there at 6pm for seven of us, but they said it was 2 1/2 hot wait!   That's BS!   So here we are at humble pie!    One star because it's always BS when you arrive for dinner etc.   secondly my old friend George from Nellos help make their sauce and you can never get in for seating.   it's not like their Biancos?"}
{"text":"Cool, Italian Pizza Place. My husband loves the pizza here. The service is always 5 star. I wish they had more food choices, esp better salads."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've had since moving to the north valley in the last year and a half. I have finally found my pizza place. I've tried them all, and nothing even comes close. Everything about it was wonderful...especially the crust. It was PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Freaking good Pizza!  We got the \"New Nicoles Favorite\" which was basil, feta, and something else.  The pizza was deicious and fresh and paired perfectly with a glass of red wine.  They offer convenient online ordering options and though they are tucked away in a shopping center, their customer service is on point.  They had my order hot and ready at the promised time.  I guess my ONLY critique would be I wish they put a *little* more sauce on the pizza, but that is just my personal preference.  I will definitely be treating myself to Spinato's - glad to have found a good  local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast delivery. I personally prefer my thin crust crispier, but I can't knock them for that."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch after reading the raving reviews of this place. I had the Baked Spaghetti Calzone, the sauce was a bit sweet, but still a delicious dish. My boyfriend had the The Super Six pizza, and they accommodated switching Italian sausage for chicken sausage. The pizza had so much flavor and the crust was perfect.  The presentation was excellent, we dug in before I got a nice picture it. So these half eaten pictures will have to do"}
{"text":"I picked up pizza from here tonight so my review is regarding take out only.  Ordered a medium create your own pizza- thin crust with roasted peppers and red onion also ordered a gluten free with roasted peppers.  The pizza was not cooked evenly when I brought it home. Almost tasted like a frozen pizza that was baked halfway. Half the pizza was cooked well but the other half was barely cooked through. The sauce is too sweet for my liking. Overall these pizzas were nothing I would spend $30 for.  I can't believe I ordered from here and not Nello's...my usual pizza joint which never disappoints.  NEVER AGAIN. also, the staff were kind of rude on the phone when I placed the order. Lady sounded really rushed like she had a million things to do. When I picked up my order the lady helping me also seemed really rushed...but there wasn't anything she would have been doing. This place needs better customer service."}
{"text":"WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Yes, this place can be a little pricey. For my large vegetarian pizza with chicken and a family sized Greek Salad it hits about $40, but it easily and happily feeds 3 greedy people. The Take-out is efficient and they even have Take-out parking. Sometimes I dine-in and when I do the service is always friendly and prompt. They have a fairly decent happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Pizza was mediocre at best...dry cheese, tasteless crust and an oversweet sauce; maybe it had something to do with the fact that the pizza was stuck in their version of a heat lamp, warmer for 15 minutes while I waited for them to make the marginal, overpriced [strawberry gorgonzola spinach] salad I ordered with my pizza. Seriously, it takes 20 minutes to make a pizza and you can't have the salad ready? I've had better frozen pizza, and $30 for a large cheese pizza and salad, I felt violated for the quality of food they provided.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful staff.  Tera is our favorite.  She is always kind and helpful.  Very family friendly with great meals for kids.  My kids love the gelato!"}
{"text":"Not good. Service was not good. Waiter didn't listen to our order and the pizza sauce was way too sweet. Toasted divinci sandwich was good"}
{"text":"Wow explains it! Meatball trio was exceptional and the gluten free pizza was phenomenal. To top it off the service was a 10/10....This a must for return visits. Awesome Sauce Spinatos....in addition we came right at the end of happy hour 5:59 and the server still gave us the discount."}
{"text":"THE best pizza in town.  The SUPER SIX is a hit in my book.  I started going to Aurelios, now called Spinatos about 30 years ago.  Mr. Aurelio went back to Chicago and Ken stayed in Arizona to start Spinato's Lucky for us he decided to stay.  I discovered Aurelios back when I delivered the Sunday morning paper to Ken who lives in Fountain Hills.   EXCELLENT PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Excellent spaghetti for a first time here. A very traditional marinara recipe with outstanding meatballs. Good family feel too!  Service can be a little wobbly."}
{"text":"Best veggie thin crust of all time! This place is the best in phoenix and I am obsessed! Great service and just straight up tasty."}
{"text":"I'm moving them up to a 5 star review.  I had family in for Christmas and we all decided to go out for Lunch the day after christmas.  We had a group of 9 ( with 4 kids ) and the service was terrific and they all really enjoyed the Spinach Pizza.  The picky kids even enjoyed their wings, spaghetti and pizza.  This is a great pizza place.  I have gotten carry out, delivery and eaten in quite a few times.  The restaurant is very nice and above average for your normal pizza place around here.  They have two things that make it a cut above most pizza anywhere.  The first thing is the spinach pizzas. If you don't like spinach stay away, but if you do, it's a real treat. The other gut busting thing to try if you are really hungry is the Baked Spaghetti Calzone. If that sounds awesome to you then yes it's that amazing.  It's a carb overload, but so worth it.  Try: - Baked Spaghetti Calzone ( Add Ricotta ) - Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach Pizza - L'Italiana Pizza"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but not anymore ...kitchen is really really slow took us 50 min to get a simple cheese pizza .. Waiter was terrible and not smile no urgency .. Never going back this POS   Stay away from this pizza place there are plenty other good ones in phoenix to go to"}
{"text":"spinatos  got a great food  nice staff.this neighbor need  this kind a food like this!"}
{"text":"Moved to AZ. less than two years ago from western NY. I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza and wings. These guys are doing it right. Plus a great atmosphere and friendly workers. My goto spot when I'm craving a good pie."}
{"text":"Came in during happy hour on a Wednesday. Was immediately greeted by friendly staff. Informed it was half off wine bottles for happy hour and four dollar premium beers. We ordered the Italiana Mamas award winning other pizza which includes feta on top and have Get Meaty. We got our drinks within the first few minutes. We ordered a Lagunitas IPA and Nitro stout. The pizza was amazing! So flavorful and rich. The Get Meaty was a bit too much meat for me but my boyfriend loved it. This will be my new go to pizza place ! Best pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"Nice, mellow atmosphere. We had the pear and Pecan salad which was fresh and delicious. The pizza was great--fresh ingredients and arrived hot. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finally found a really good pizza in paradise valley and THEY DELIVER ! All the flavor you could ask for. I've only had a few different specialty pizza's here (chicken presto pesto & super six) but they were both excellent. Plenty of meat, great thin crust (amen) and all carried good flavor. Strawberry gorgonzola salad and dressing were spot on. Top spot in this area by far. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Below is my first review of this restaurant in which I raved about how good the Pizza was but after our second dining experience I have to give them 2 stars. Tonight the pizza crust was soggy and the flavors were only ok. The Chicago Meat Calzone was just nasty full of onions and again a soggy crust. What a shame as we were so excited to have found good pizza but if you cant be consistent you cant have my business. We wont go back and pay premium prices for anything less than perfection. This place offers no deals and sporadic quality.  MY FIRST REVIEW BELOW  We've had every type of crappy pizza you might imagine over the years so it was a great suprise when we ordered the spinach pizza and small calzone stuffed with spaghetti noodles, sausage and ricotta cheese. All of these items where bursting with flavor and for the first time since New York we could actually smell the garlic on the pizza. This pizza packs a flavor punch and I was out the door for under $25.00 with enough food to feed a family of four. I did take out for our first dining experience but now that they have set the hook we will return in short order for the in house treatment. So far highly recommended.  4/14/2012 THIRD REVIEW UPDATE- RAISED THEM FROM TWO BACK TO FOUR STARS.  My wife loves this Pizza otherwise I would have never went back to give them another chance but two visits later I am firmly convinced my bad experience was a fluke.  The Pizza has been excellent and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I always loved to come to Spinato's because of their phenomenal chicken sausage. I'm allergic to pork and this was close to Italian sausage, until now. Last week when we went to Spinato's they changed their chicken sausage. It used to be the ground chicken sausage which was just like the Italian sausage but now they went to a sliced chicken sausage, definitely not the same texture and not the same taste.  I guess I'll have to give Spinatos a pass unless the old chicken sausage returns"}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good, wings are good and overall, I like them. Don't get their \"insalata caprese\" because it is waaaaaaaaaaay overpriced and just ok. There are better pizza places, and better wing places, but over all, they are pretty good."}
{"text":"Well, this is why I can't trust Yelp anymore and don't use it. 4-5 stars for this place is ludicrous. Best pizza in the valley? Ugh! I'm being generous with 2. The meatballs are awful, the bread too soft, the pizza is average at best. It seems as though all the ingredients have been sitting out for ages. Nothing seems fresh. My coworkers order every Sunday so they must love it. When I'm too busy to go out I sometimes order (rarely) disappointed again."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, if I'm rating the food this place gets 5 out of 5 stars! Food is amazing!!!  However the service at this place, especially when it's NOT busy is just the worst. Last time we were here it was early and I had to go up to the hostess 3 times to get a waiter at all and she said this other guy was our server but that guy said she was so we got next to no service. Seriously, 15 minutes sitting before anyone came over!  Then tonight again, late, pretty dead and our waitress took 7-10 minutes before getting us and never came back after we got food. Some other guy had to pick up her slack.  I love the food here but I don't know if I can ever eat at this one again."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite pizza place anywhere!! There's not one anywhere close by (please build one in Mesa, Queen Creek, Gilbert area!!) so I always stop by if I'm ever in an area of one. The Mama's Signature is the most delicious thing you could ever eat. WOW!!!   The first time someone got this at the office I worked at in Phoenix I was a little hesitant with spinach on the pizza but this pizza is what made me start eating spinach in my life - because this was so good!!  Please - please - please build one out further East!!"}
{"text":"Quantity and value is not worth $$ charged. I ordered a to-go entree salad for $11.29 and the portion size was on the smaller end.   Considering this is not a high-end establishment, I was expecting a bigger portion size for the amount paid. I will definitely think twice about ordering from Spinato's in the future. Lots of other great places in the area that provide a reasonable quantity for the money."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza in the city... what the heck happened? Our appetizer came out after our pizza. Soggy salad. Underdone mushy pizza when we had asked for it extra crispy. Did the family sell this place to someone else?"}
{"text":"We LOVE LOVE LOVE Spinatos.  We are regulars there.  Every time were have company visit we go there.  They have amazing pizza and salads.  I am sure everything is amazing.  I am a creature of habit.  I always order the same thing and NEVER get tired of it.  I recommend the Signature pizza with spinach and garlic.  It is awesome.  My son loves the Hawaiian pizza.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Spinato's Pizzeria is so good that I honestly can't enjoy any other pizza place anymore because they've raised my standards. If you know a place that has better pizza and you've actually tried a few of Spinato's menu items, please message me."}
{"text":"Spaghetti meatball calzones!  Delicious!  My husband and I eat at this Spinatos way too often, but the food is just too yummy.  The strawberry spinach salad is amazing and the pizza and calzones are fantastic.  We definitely have stopped going to other pizza places as there are very little places comparable to Spinatos."}
{"text":"We like the food and the location/building is super nice. So that's a good review. But if you plan on needing ketchup - like my son when ordering chicken tenders from the kid's menu - you need to bring your own. They didn't have any ketchup at the restaurant so I went across the parking lot to Basha's to buy some Heinz. It was a bummer that I got caught in line behind a guy who wasn't familiar with using his debit card so the process took a while before I returned to my family to finish our meal. 4 stars for a restaurant that doesn't have ketchup when they offer a kid's menu. Clearly this condiment continues its decline in American culture."}
{"text":"Mama Spinato's Signature Pizza is the best pizza I've ever had, hands down!  My boyfriend and I have a monthly Spinato's date that started prior to their move to the new location and will continue as long as they stay open and we live in the valley.  YES, it's that good.  The crust is thin and perfect, the slightly sweet pizza sauce, the minced garlic, loads of spinach, diced tomatoes and cheese.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I've had other selections from the menu as well, including the Italian Beef sandwich, all have been excellent, but since trying the Mama Spinato's Signature I haven't been able to justify ordering anything else.  The staff is always friendly and the new location is nice.  I am originally from the Midwest and am familiar with their sister chain, Aurelio's, and I'm so glad I can come here and have a taste of home."}
{"text":"Went out w my fam for a birthday lunch for my bro. I've had spinatos before at the office courtesy of my coworkers.   The place was clean and we had a big party in the back room and a lot of traffic wasn't walking behind us so I didn't have to worry about anyone making me scoot my chair in as I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for PIZZA!   The pizza is awesome it never disappoints.  We had some pepperoni pizza, some meaty pizza w peppers and even a gluten free pizza and honestly I would eat that gluten free pizza all day. It was thin and crispy and held up the toppings well!  Per person we spent about $12-$15 total but my family are hearty eaters. Heck a child in our family can clear half a medium pizza and wings. Yes yes we're working on child obesity in the US don't worry.  I dabbled in everyone's food as I always do. I had artichoke stuffed mushrooms with pancetta on top. I really liked the saltiness of the pancetta cutting in with the mushrooms, cheese and artichoke. It was a good idea.  We also tried pasta. The spaghetti w marinara was ok the house sausage added was too done almost burnt - I suppose some may appreciate that & the noodles felt cold against the warm marinara. One thing I don't like about pasta is it being rolled in olive oil before served. That tells me it's not fresh and pre cooked and sat a while and it tasted like it. I will pass on any pasta dish in the future bc what others ordered didn't look impressive either.  Lastly the calzone. We got a Chicago steak calzone which is served with au jus n I added sweet peppers. It was so so. The crust was actually the best part whereas the filling was just meh. I will pass on the steak calzones but maybe I'd try a sandwich next time. I'm sure a diff combination would be good maybe pesto or something would have gave it that wow!   The service was great, our waiter attentive and I never complain when we come w more than 5 people bc I feel more sorry for the staff than us. He brought out a free cannoli for the birthday boy also which he enjoyed saying, \"it was good and it was sweet too.\"   Do I recommend spinatos? Of course their pizza is out of this world. My kids are very picky about their pizza (they didn't get that from me...maybe) but they loved spinatos pizza and devoured it like cavemen.   The only reason it didn't get my 5 star review was because of how some of our food turned out.  Parts were done extremely well and others were meh. I don't like feeling meh. I even took the pasta home to let the noodles soak up the sauce and you know how spaghetti is awesome the day after? I was still meh."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, the crust is thin and flaky. The green mango tea was delicious.Great sauce and fresh ingredients. The waitress we had didn't seem like she was having a good day, but nonetheless it was a great place to eat. The wait was long but the patio is comfortable and the food was well worth the 30min wait."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was great. Chairs were comfy. Price was good. Great lunch. Clint was great even helped me clean up my toddlers spilt drink. I will definitely be back. Glad the rain detoured us to this parking lot or we might have missed this place."}
{"text":"Food was great! Appetizers were mozzarella with tomatoes, very good. Meatballs, delish! And garlic bread, good but did lack the cheese on some pieces. Ordered the spaghetti calzone, all time favorite! Chicago style pizza, yummy! Ravioli was superb! Dessert yummy too! Highly recommend Spinato's! Service was average, no complaints."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Zero stars.  I'm sure somebody likes the food, I may have liked the food, I don't know. I don't know because I ordered for pickup, and when I came in to \"pick up\" there was no food. Not only that, but when they did find the order, it was 6 pizzas, not 1 Italian beef. I am from Chicago, I have never eaten here in my life. I have never called here in my life. I have had the same number for 10 years. The condescending manager, told me otherwise. I must have forgotten ordering from here, 1700 miles away from my home, last month. As for the food, I don't know. As for the management, horrendous. Find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant with quality pizza and pasta at good prices.  The wifey and I usually go here after church, and they have a small and quaint ambience.  The service is great while the pizza just tastes amazing.  We will definitely be back for my pizza cravings after church!"}
{"text":"The spaghetti was everything I wanted it to be! I'd been here once before & remembered liking it enough I was happy to go back. We were in a group of four & started off with 3 appetizers: Garlic Bread, Baked Artichoke Crostini & Stuffed Mushrooms. All were surprisingly delicious! You would kind of expect at least one thing to be average, but nope! I would go back just for the crostini & the mushrooms alone!! Now, I know they're a pizzeria but I was really craving just a classic pasta. So I went with the \"Create Your Own\" option & chose spaghetti, with marinara + meatballs. Like I said, it was exactly what I hoped! The sauce is tasty & they didn't skimp! I'm not normally a huge meat eater, but every so often the perfect meatball sounds like life, & these were! They were flavorful, tender, the kind you could eat without any sauce & they would still be great! Oh, & our waitress simply added to the nice experience! She was personable & pleasant! I know there's always a ton of other places to try, but I'm looking forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"We met at this restaurant to celebrate. I was excited about the gluten-free options and picked a gluten-free pizza. I loved the food, it was all really enjoyable. We had lots of fun. Service could've been a little more attentive (it was a busy day, I wasn't too mad about it). We still want to go eat there again."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. For starters, they have some good drink specials each night. On Tuesday, they have $5 glasses of wine and $3 beers. We ordered a pizza and it was really good. Lots of toppings and cheese and sauce and cooked to perfection! For dessert we shared a canollo (yes the Italian in me wants to use the proper term! lol. One conollo, two canolli!) Ok, I digress! The server found out it was a birthday and wrote on the plate in chocolate Happy Birthday and took the dessert off the bill. Very nice. She checked on us several times and kept our drinks full. The owner or maybe manager came over and he was very nice. Very genuine and you could tell that he really cared about what people thought and wanted everyone to have a great experience. Where I would have probably given this place 4 stars, his presence and personality easily put it at 5 stars. Service was impecable. Pizza and dessert was really good, and they made a new customer out of me!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves pizza and this place does it right! My favourite dishes to recommend are the spaghetti calzone and the bruschetta."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Pizza and salad. Check out their patio, and sit outside. Great staff, and fast service. The music and vibe was relaxing and made for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and often order delivery which is great because we don't have a lot of good delivery our this way. Very convenient. The food is always good and service is always excellent. We love the meatball trio and the Davinci sandwich. The anti pasto salad is also delicious with the house dressing. Every pizza we have tried has been amazing. Love their sauce and crust. The only thing we have had that is not great are the wings they are soggy, chewy, and kinda bland..."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me over 15 years living in the Valley to find Spinato's!  I've been coming for about 4 years now.   Hands down this is the best Chicago Style thin crust Pizza around. The sauce is one of a kind...I wish they would jar it for resale.   The pizza is consistent at each visit and across locations.  I typically get the sausage, jalapeño, extra sauce and request crispy.  DELICIOUS!!!  They do a pretty brisk carry-out business and there is a separate entry for this.   The employees tend to be the same which is great.  Sara at this location is amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to order take out. Ordered a pizza and a meatball appetizer. Person over the phone said my order would take 30-35 minutes. Showed up after 35 minutes to pick up my food and sat there and waited an additional 20 minutes before it came out.     The staff was friendly but the operation was sloppy. No one seemed to have a specific role, they were all just all over the place. I asked twice if my food was ready and both times they told me it was coming out. There was a few tables of families in the place but not enough to justify 55 minutes for a pizza.    Anyways... Got home with my food and was excited to try it out. Meatballs seemed like that sat for a while. The cheese had hardened and the meatballs were a little dry. The pizza I ordered had spinach, tomato, feta cheese, sausage & Italian beef. Way too much spinach. Barely any meat. The pizza dough was soggy, I couldn't hold a slice with my hands I had to use a fork. And it cost me $31. Don't mind paying for quality food but I would like the quality in paying for.     I wouldn't waste my time with this place."}
{"text":"Spinatos is my favorite pizza!  The sauce is the best and the toppings are amazing. I've been here probably a dozen times and have only had pizza. Well I went here yesterday for a late lunch and decided to try something else. I got the Italian beef sandwich with provolone and it was amazing! I don't think I've had a better sandwich! We got the meatballs for an appetizer and those were delicious as well. I also just found out that they have take and bake!  You can get a pie to take home either uncooked or 3/4 cooked. I love this!  I got one to have for dinner. You could even freeze it and save for that late night you want Spinatos but don't want to drive. Yay! My life is complete!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for take out Italian food. Although dinning in is excellent too. The staff is amazing and the offer a military discount for dine in and take out. Always remember to ask about specials for the day or week too when ordering. Although they have branched out to some of the local supermarkets. I still like the pizzas from the restaurant fresh. The spaghetti sauce seems to taste the same store or restaurant . A couple times things have taken longer than usual and they have always comp something on the bill. Red velvet ding dongs are wonderful desert with gelato."}
{"text":"After much fanfare at work about the famous garlic spinach pizza, the wife and I tried Spinato's for the first time.  We arrived just before 6 PM and our server told us the good news: Happy Hour prices were still on. We ordered two \"small\" pizzas for $8 each and also a half dozen boneless wings. We ordered one of the Spinach and Garlic and also the \"Super 6\" or something like that.  Wings get 4.5 Stars \"6\" pizza gets 4.5 Stars Spinach and Garlic pizza gets 3 stars from the wife and 5 from me. Service gets 5 Stars  My wife preferred the \"6\" pizza, but would have liked the peppers cut a bit smaller. I felt the Spinach pizza felt fresh and \"healthy\" but, also, that there was a tiny bit too much spinach on it.  Our server, Johnny, was an amazing server. He was attentive to drinks, brought food promptly and did great to explain to us the benefit of the \"Happy Hour\" menu option we had just made it for.  We enjoyed our overall experience."}
{"text":"We picked this place on a whim after searching for somewhere to eat dinner and this place just might be my new favorite pizza place! I love how they serve the pizza on top of a pizza rack so that the bottom of the pizza stays crispy and the pizza is cut into squares instead of triangles. I don't know why but the square cut pizza is easier to eat and the fact that the pizza was cut all the way through was a plus. Some pizza places I've been too they cut the pizza, but it's not cut all the way so when you are trying to get a slice, you need to get a knife to help cut the pizza out. We ordered a large Salsiccia Di Pollo, a medium The Combo, a family size Caesar salad, and Cheesy Garlic Bread with Marinara. With 7 people eating we had only 2 squares of pizza leftover. The Combo pizza had to be my favorite as the red sauce and all the cheese with the toppings made it perfection! And the Marinara from the garlic bread was so good, I kept it and was dipping my pizza into it! Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch for my friends birthday.  He has never been here before and loves it.  I know there are people from all over the country that have their own idea about pizza.  Well that idea and change can get you a ride on the light rail.  Pizza like other food is subjective.  I love spinato's pizza and will be a fan for life."}
{"text":"Phoenix metro has a lot of great pizza.  I was surprised HOW good this place was.  The garlic cheesebread was amazing. I had a sandwich, and the meat had to have been fresh cut.  The chips were okay.  Our pizzas were really good, they could have done with a little more time in the oven.  Great place.  Definitely returning."}
{"text":"We had a large group of about 30 people with only one server to serve us at lunch time. We did call ahead of time but they would not take reservations. People in our party didn't start getting their food until 1 hour later. One person didn't get their food until 90 minutes later and when they said that they didn't want it anymore the management did nothing to resolve the situation nor did the servers resolve the issue when it was brought up. I would not recommend this location to eat."}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER I'm a huge pizza lover and this place is the best. Their pizza is no comparison to any other pizza I've tasted. I also tried their appetizer it was bread with melted cheese idk what it was called but it was amazing!!!! And my awesome waiter convinced me to try their cannoli and man it was soooo good and I'm not a fan of chocolate (shocker, I know) but it was so good and I paired it with their vanilla gelato and I left their extremely satisfied. Not only was the food amazing but our server Brandon was phenomenal I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Tasty food! I could drink gallons of the red sauce!"}
{"text":"I go to Spinato's at least once a week. Usually get it to go. However on a Saturday afternoon we went by and ate. We had their pizza special . We were able to get 2 of the small specialty pizzas for $8 each. That means the Super Six for my boyfriend and I. His 10 year old got the all meat pizza. It s a very good deal and value. The wait staff is attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The place for a Saturday afternoon was quite busy but it still had a relaxed feel. Our pizza was delicious and we managed to have enough to take home from both of the pizzas. Spinatos is the best pizza in my book."}
{"text":"I never ordered from this place until one day my work ordered pizza for the shop meeting and let me tell ya, it was super good and delicious   Love it !!! Thank you Spinatos.   EA"}
{"text":"I came here last week for lunch and it was a good choice. i would recommended to anyone :) try take out it's awesome too.  EA"}
{"text":"Spinato's is a a decent sized restaurant. The food is very good. The staff there is super friendly. The waitress I had was very open and comfortable in making a conversation with you."}
{"text":"Hands down best calzone I've ever had! Got the spaghetti calzone, no meat for me, add ricotta cheese, like a dream come true! Next time I will try it with no cheese and maybe some peppercini and mushrooms. Also their signature marinara sauce is so good, I would swim in it if i could."}
{"text":"Having heard many great things about Spinatos and having had thier pizza for lunch at work, I decided to give the restaurant a try.  I went on Monday June 11,2012 around 6:30 in the evening and it was packed, so I thought, good sign, food must be good.   This place is awful.  It was extremely loud, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  Do not go here expecting authentic Italian food.  Its fast food italian quality at best, much like Fazolis was.    We waited an hour for our food and the server forgot to put in our order for our appetizer which was garlic breadsticks.  The Manager came over and tried to give me a free dessert for the mixup.  I passed on the dessert, I wanted breadsticks before my meal not a dessert after.  Also, the food quality is poor.  My meal came with a greek salad.  The only thing greek about the salad was the feta cheese.   Greek salad shouldnt come with italian dressing.    I have had thier pizzas and they are good.  Anything else on the menu is mediocre.  I would order thier pizza as take out and skip the insanely loud and slow dining experience."}
{"text":"Spinato's is an awesome place. The pizza is always fresh, and there's a ton of different pre-built options to choose from. My favorite thing, though, is that you can choose to build your own pizza. The only thing that somewhat annoys me about building your own is that they charge by number of toppings, and some of the options apparently \"count as two toppings.\" One of those happens to be bell peppers. I love bell peppers, and they're super cheap as pizza toppings, so why should I be getting charged double what they charge for pepperoni or tomatoes? I just don't get it.  Other than that, there's really nothing to complain about. The food is delish, the service is on-point, and they have a delectible cannoli! Mmmmm I love me some cannoli. I also like that they deliver now! At their original location I don't think delivery was an option (I could be wrong) but now, as long as you live close enough, delivery comin' atcha!"}
{"text":"I've been missing out!   The family and I went on a Tuesday night. I was wary as I've been disappointed in pretty much every pizza joint in Scottsdale. Getting there 45 minutes before close, we tried not the be \"those people\", but ended up staying 20 minutes past close by talking to our super friendly server.  We started with the bruschetta. It was different and delicious ($8). Very large portion of crispy bread with peppers and fresh tomatoes. Yum! The \"family style\" mixed salad wasn't a highlight, but all the dressings were great ($10)! We decided to try their large specialty spinach pizza. It was huge, fresh, garlic-y, and outright delicious.  We had lots of left overs even after the four of us indulged.   Our server was great. My Mom even suggested her and my brother get married. She wasn't opposed. Neither am I - discounted Spinato's. Yeah!"}
{"text":"5/5 for food and 4/5 for service. I'm glad we came to this location - Spinato's is the only pizza place that we have consistently seen on \"Best in Phoenix\" lists that doesn't have a hipster/indie vibe, which is sometimes nice to have a break from. This seems like a more family-oriented joint, and we enjoyed having enough space at our table, and between our table and the next (not always a perk you get at downtown restaurants).  Food: We shared a Caesar salad to start with, which was really good (they do homemade croutons and parmesan crisps). Nothing mind-blowing, but very yummy and a comforting classic. We also ordered two small pizzas - the L'Italiana and Chicken Presto Pesto. The L'Italiana featured the famous \"sweet sauce,\" which goes really well with the roasted red peppers, spinach, and feta. We couldn't get enough of this pizza. The sauce is very unique, and worth coming back for. The CPP was delicious, too - not quite as unique as the L'Italiana, but generous on the pesto, with big chicken chunks that didn't get burnt to a crisp in the oven. Together, they were plenty big enough for the two of us, and provided leftovers for dinner that night, too. We intended on getting dessert, but we were just too full after the pizza! Maybe next time.  Service: Nice, friendly, and helpful! Our server pointed out which things were most popular, didn't push us to order quickly, and was very kind. Drink refills came quickly and without prompting. We did wait a while for our pizzas, but we expected that from previous reviews.   Friendly, family-oriented pizza with delicious food, a fun backstory and super nice staff. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is some awesome pizza. It's all about the sauce. Spinato's does it right. I get a pie every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"You know how people say \"probably\" the best pizza place in town? Well I'm gonna say that this is BY FAR the best pizza in town. And I've had pizzas before.   My kids love it, my husband can have this everyday and even our St.Bernard goes crazy when he smells this pizza. Especially when a slice mistakenly drops und the table ;).  The service is awesome..!!   I def have to thank Sean for his service today. From the second he answered and greeted me, I was flooded with so much positive energy and a great sense of humor. I called for Pizza, and ended up getting Wings and a great recommendation for a dessert! Sean, this little red velvet bundle of HAPPINESS is exactly what we needed after pizza and wings!! Thank you for being you Sean! It's employees like you that make us greedy customers come back for more!   Thank Spinatos for making our movie night weekends so tasty and if I could give you guys 10 stars... I'd probably give you a million!!"}
{"text":"If your are looking for a great place to bring the family  and enjoy some amazing pizza. This is the place!!!! My family have been going to this place and some of their other locations for years. We go for birthdays and family gathering. The staff is great and very friendly. The best pizza I have ever had. I recommend this to everyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived on a lively Friday night and were seated well within the 10 minute wait time we were told. I've been here before and they never fail to serve a good meal with plenty of food and a fantastic staff. Spinato's really does strike that optimal balance between making you feel like family while still being a business. Last night I had pasta with meatballs, as always, a good, tasty, meatball spiced juuust right with the spaghetti cooked properly (neither over or under cooked). So much I took home half. I'm an especially fond of their Chicago- style thin crust pizza (love \"da Greek\"). I recommend it. Their Italian beef is the real deal, too. My only single note of caution is their red sauce (aka \"gravy\" where I come from), you had better like it Chicago-style, which is slightly sweeter than other regional styles (NY or NJ, for example). I've never been disappointed at Spinato's. Kudos to the family for keeping it both high quality & real."}
{"text":"Yelp, stop asking me about gender-neutral bathrooms. Great pizza. Would highly recommend. Soft drinks are pricey."}
{"text":"Great pizza!   Crispy crust with lots of toppings to try. Sauce is slightly sweet.  I had a small specialty, half spinach and half chicken pesto.  Loved it.  We were a group of 8, the night before Thanksgiving and the restaurant was packed!  Our terrific waiter was doing the best he could, but we never got our salads.   So we ate more pizza than we had planned but still had plenty to take home.  The small specialty can easily be shared by 2.   Also had good happy hour wine and beer prices."}
{"text":"It's the crust... This location is awesome. Although they all have the same taste, the service is best here. Their sauce is very robust and flavorful. The price is reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Good decor, average Italian food, lots of TVs.   I got the chicken parmigiana which was a hearty portion and good texture but very average flavor and skimpy amount of sauce. The pizzas looked very good, so I'd like to go back and try one."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight...this is not a pizzeria.  At a pizzeria you can get a slice, just a slice.  Here, you cannot.  You can get a personal pizza but we all know that doesn't compare. (I want a piece of pizza I have to fold in half)  Would you consider the California Pizza Kitchen a pizzeria?  No, you would not.   I'm giving it a three right now, out of kindness really, because I haven't tried the food.  I was just looking for a slice the other day and went in hoping to find one.  Much to my dismay they didn't offer it so I just drove up to Redendo's where I was able to get a lovely, yummy, single slice of pizza.    It reminds me of a place back home called Pizza and Brew, which is an Italian restaurant that serves pizza in a casual atmosphere.  A family place if you will."}
{"text":"Super tasty food, fair price and kind staff. Every time I got I have great service, my water is constantly filled and so is my belly AND my wallet :) rare combination."}
{"text":"No trip to Phoenix is complete for me unless I have Spinato's Pizza.  This is the first time I have been to this new location and it is just as good as the others with a really nice decor and great service.  We always get the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, and it's always good.  Also, we always start with the garlic cheese bread, seriously the best I have had anywhere!  The sauce on their pizza is different, a little sweet, but I love it.  If you are looking for good pizza in Phoenix, this would be not only my top, but my only recommendation!"}
{"text":"2nd only to Giordano's. Love the sweet pizza sauce. The waiter had me do the Mamas signature and i was pretty much blown away."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! I smelled it from the gas station across the street and 2 days later I was having a date night with my bf there. Short seating time, friendly service, and a simple menu. We ordered the cheese and artichoke crostini for an appetizer. It was basically cheesy artichoke dip on ciabatta bread. It came with 4 pieces and was easy to eat and saved us from using too little or too much dip ourselves. For pizza we ordered the small (11 in) chicken presto pesto and it was delicious! Chicken, artichokes, purple onions, alfredo sauce, and a pesto drizzle came together swimmingly. We finished all but 2 pieces due to the crostini. I'm typically very picky about my pizza crust but this was great. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried pretty much every specialty pizza and they are all delicious. I am picky with my pizza but I love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Just like the Tempe location!!! Pizza was perfect and the house Cab pairs perfectly :)"}
{"text":"I have to say the manager here and the staff are super friendly and understanding...not to mention trusting! I took my little sister here for dinner one evening and totally forgot my wallet at home!!! Who does that...it didn't even dawn on me until it was time to pay!?! I felt like such an idiot! Couldn't believe I did that. I sheepishly told my waitress the issue and she said she would let the manager know. To my surprise the manager said no problem! Just pay over the phone when I got home! Wow! And they didn't even make me feel bad about it or anything. That was extremely nice of them in my opinion! I was gonna leave my sister there to do dishes :)  Food was bomb per usual!"}
{"text":"I really haven't found much better pizza in the north Phoenix area. The thin crust is definitely the way to go. The toppings and cheese are plenty and the sauce is a good compliment (a bit sweet for my taste, but not enough to overpower the pizza).  We sat outside and let's be honest here, it's hard for an Arizona restaurant to have an outside patio and have anyone want to sit at it between May and October. But it was pleasant (if not a bit windy from the hurricane fans and misters).  The service was good and the total for both of us (1 medium pizza, 1 salad that we split and 2 iced teas) was $35.00.   I was really impressed that they had a separate gluten-free menu. I can eat wheat for days, but it is nice to go to a place that offers alternatives for those people who need them.  All in all, I'd recommend Spinato's. We will definitely be going back (mainly so my husband can try the spaghetti calzone)"}
{"text":"Where else can you go for true homemade Italian food and only pay $32 for two people?  My daughter and I had an appetizer, an entree salad, a small pizza, and dessert!  Everything was fresh and each plate was better than the one before!    Monday is all day happy hour, go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Spinato's but this place is always so packed that we just lose our patience most of the times. But when we have a chance to sit down, oh, it's on.  It's like...every item on their menu is good. We usually order a large pepperoni with thick crust for everyone. Kids love it, adults love it. The pizza sauce is a lot sweeter than other pizza places, that's why the kids LOVE it.   I personnally like thin crust and something else rather than just pepperoni. I've had many different things, I don't remember the names anymore. But like I said, everything has been delicious so far.   I also love their wine list. The moscato they carry is very tasty, and I think during Happy Hours it's 5 dollars a glass.  Gelato as dessert is also a perfect note to end a nice dinner. I wish the restaurant had more space, so all the fans can come in."}
{"text":"At a friends urging, I gave this place another shot and I'm glad I did! Pizza was great! We had a large group and ordered a number of different pizzas to share. They all were very good and service was excellent too. Sauce was still a bit sweet on a few pies but, overall much more even handed. I'm definitely stopping back for more!"}
{"text":"We found Spinatos the day we moved to the 16 St. And Bell  area. Amazing pizza! I was hooked the first time we ordered."}
{"text":"Poor customer experiance. We did an online order and ordered what we thought was going to be their thin crust pizza that we have had in the past many many times. After recieving our food we realize we were sent a Sicilian style pizza. Called to figure out a solution and was basically told \"you ordered it, its your fault\". The only problem with that is that due to how their site looks on a mobile phone the only option we saw was a small or large and apparently that was Sicilian. This review is not about their food its about a missed opportunity to assist your customers. Instead of putting the blame on me try to further understand the situation and provide options. Lastly for the manager that didnt even come to the phone I hope you take this feedback and further step into the leadership role and hop on the phone to speak to your customers instead hiding when there is an issue."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Spinato's! They have the best Italian food for the price! Their service has always been wonderful and accommodating. The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathrooms, which is something that is always concerning to me. So if you're looking to try some place new with great prices and service I would highly recommend Spinato's!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, perfect dining area! This lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places, the staff and waitress' are really friendly with along great customer service! (and I am picky with people who serve at restaurants!) this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat. I ordered the side \"Chef Eric's Caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni\" I highly recommend For GREAT pizza! However the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped it...but made it up by giving me Nicole's Notable Chocolate Chip cookies :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place...we probably go once a week and enjoy ourselves every single time. The pizza is AMAZING!! We always get the same thing,  a large (cause we always want to take some home!) thin crust pizza with green olives, feta and salami... and it is literally the best pizza we've ever had! Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good, chill option. Def dont pass up an opportunity to experience Spinatos!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a Chili's, then one day, it was Spinato's.  I'd never been to a Spinato's before, but I've been there numerous times since my first visit.  The pizzas are delicious, there is just something about them--I think it's the sweet tomato sauce that they use.  This is probably the best pizza in the valley, IMO.  My favorite is the Spicy Italian w/ Banana Peppers.  Calzones and sandwiches are also very delicious, I like the meatball and Italian sausage sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable for dinner, and for lunch if you are splitting a pizza with a friend or two.  Haven't been in for happy hour but the specials look good."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in Phoenix.  Their pizza sauce is amazing.  Eat in or take out but definitely don't pass this up for great pizza"}
{"text":"Very good Pizza. Delivered almost hot, but not cold--thank goodness. Not New York pizza, but certainly very good for Scottsdale. I like the sweet sauce, and not tons of cheese. Salad was fresh and good. The bill was high at $30 but its worth it --the meal was excellent. They did forget one of our items, so I need to call to deduct that from the bill."}
{"text":"Love this place! A real taste of Chicago. Awesome pizza and calzones! Servers are weird but who cares when I get such oh delicious italian food, oh and they have Peroni on tap! My kind of place!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Orange County the last 3 years and I'm so happy to be back so I can eat my favorite pizza again.  I never found anything close to Spinatos over there.   You won't be disappointed. The Spinach pizza and Spinach calzone is amazing!  Spicy Italian is awesome too!!  If you like salads you can't go wrong with the antipasto, Greek or the strawberry spinach Gorgonzola.  I guess I like spinach:)  It's definitely worth the drive if you like thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I love that they have so many varieties and I have yet to have had a bad one in the many years I have gone.  The staff is always top notch. The customer service is very good and the right mix of attentive and letting you enjoy your meal in peace.  Some people try too hard at trying to be best pals with you in the hopes of driving up their tip. This staff here is friendly, honest about their likes and dislikes, and seems to know that when you are out with your wife, it's her you want to talk to. They still manage to keep my water filled and smoothly take care of everything.  The food is very tasty and possibly the only reason I can't give out a 5 is its so hard to get a table because everyone else feels like me about the place. Please please please get a bigger place for your Tempe location! Other than that is 5 material for sure!"}
{"text":"By far the best place to get pizza in the Valley. They have so many speciality pizza and this restaurant is the only place where I go to try other things on the menu because I know I won't be disappointed. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is hands down the very best pizza place in Phoenix. As a former Chicagoan, I know Chicago style pizza, and Spinato's is CHICAGO STYLE. They offer excellent service, fast and friendly waiters and waitresses (can you still say that or are they really just waitpeople now?) The food is great -- all of their offerings. The atmosphere is homey, and family oriented. Their location on Bell and 16th is small -- so big parties plan ahead (they will put tables together for you). They do have a nice outdoor area, but it gets hot in the summer, and sometimes smoke drifts in from patrons at neighboring businesses. Overall, excellent food, good prices, and real Chicago Style pizza. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This pizza is very good and unique. The taste is great but there is a ton of grease or butter on the pie and in the crust (What doesn't taste good with butter?), The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is the price but aside from that it is excellent pizza but very rich and not the kind that you would order for delivery too often - more of a treat."}
{"text":"The pizza was dry and overcooked,  the flavor of the toppings was good had the pizza  been cooked better it might have tasted better. The cannoli was the best thing we ate. Wings were okay. I'd like to give them one more chance."}
{"text":"This is a really good place in a sort of crummy location... Its near nothing, unless you happen to live right there near that particular strip mall. Location aside, its OK dining there, nothing fancy at all. Staff is very friendly, and I like their menu. Had salad and thin crust pizza, very good. I've had delivery a few times as well and its still been pretty good even if lukewarm. Verging on great pizza, and all other food is way above average. I like this place!"}
{"text":"Would probably given this place 5 stars but the sweet sauce in the large  mama's signature calzone absolutely killed any temps to try to eat the thing so that was $18 down the drain...the down side of the experience. The sauce was so so sweet it just did not mesh with the spinach at all. Other than that the wings, garlic bread, and the large margherita pizza hold the tomatoes was pretty good (pricy pizza @ $20). For a bill that was  $55, a little more then what I would have expected to pay, this was my 1st time here so now I know. Service with Janet at the bar was excellent so I probably given another go and look at other options next time."}
{"text":"New building is nicely designed. It has nice Chicago feel to it. Check out the brick ceiling in the bar area! The waiter was very nice.  I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich for lunch. It come with potato chips for $10. Mtn Dew was $2.80. After a $2 tip my check was over $14. So while it is a little pricey, it was definitely worth it.  The sandwich was great with each half weighing about 1lb each with a lot of meat. They also had a perfect amount of sauce and mozzarella cheese. It also comes with a side of good potato chips.  Usually these sandwiches are too dry or just lacking flavor. This one was neither. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Everyone else's food also looked great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the world.... That special occasion pizza that you want to sit in the pizzeria to enjoy the whole experience. Discovered by my wife quite by accident. She and the girls had gone out for lunch and brought me leftovers. I said to myself, \"Self, this is truly wonderful and yet somehow quite familiar!\" As time passed it dawned on me... My favorite pizzeria from the 70's... \"Aurelio's is pizza\" which had been located on the south side of McDowell road just East of Galvin Parkway beck in the 70's to (early 80's?).  Well, Aurelios disappeared to my sadness and then came Spinato's... Born again! Talked to a number of employees and none of them could recall any connection to Aurelio's... then one day I was flogging the tired horse and our waitress (of my age group) says, \"We've always been Spinato's... unless you mean when it was owned by the people that owned Aurelio's...\" The riddle is solved and I have found the grail. It IS the sauce,primarily, along with quality ingredients. I'm sure like other reviewer's, it's a matter of taste of course. Anyway, just wanted to add a review, been a faithful patron since the epiphany but wanted too throw out the Aurelio's name in case any other long time Phoenix folk had given up finding that taste."}
{"text":"I drove by it so many times and finally went in with my daughter.  I am extremely picky about my pizza, being from New York, I prefer New York style brick oven of course, still do.  However, after putting my prejudices away, I ordered their thin crust margarita pizza and was blown away.  It was absolutely delicious.  I have ordered it many times since, brought my family in and they have being equally satisfied with their choices.  In my heart nothing beats my New York style pizza but this one is a very very close runner up!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Same great food just a new/better location. If you're used to the location near 12th St and Glendale this is definitely an upgrade. The restaurant is a lot bigger and can accommodate many more people. I went for the first time last night and yet again had a great experience. There was a lot of people so I had about a 20 minute wait. I would recommend calling ahead to make a reservation. Relaxed atmosphere huge bar and patio area. Also this location has it's own take out area so you want be cluttered in the host area like the smaller location."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Phoenix. Even better than the fancy pizza restaurants. The only problem is that I eat here too much and it's not cheap!"}
{"text":"Just out and about. Son wanted pasta, so looked up pasta place, Spinato's pop up so we took a chance. Pizza was great, salad was awesome and meatball appetizer was delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"OMG....there pizza is better than sex...lol. Never disappointed always heaven sent....No pizza place compares to them. Xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Very good pizza here. I usually don't go for the thin crust style ones but here it is great. I think its the sauce that makes it so yummy with it being slighty spicy. Seem to have good menu overall but I get pizza every time, they also have a decent beer selection.  More upscale restaurant feel to this place."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza every time! We would always pick this up on our way home! We always have a hard time figuring out which location we are ordering from via phone and we're wrong once, but they were able to transfer the order over, luckily!"}
{"text":"Maria was by far the best waitress I've ever had... Ever! She was very attentive to all of her tables and had the best attitude. Other than great service, the food of course was perfect. Real homemade Italian food! The salad was great and our pizza was called the Combo, sausage, sweet red and green bell peppers with mushroom and mozzarella on a thin crispy crust. Sooooo good! Desert not to mention was ideal! It was Maria's favorite and we decided to go with her suggestion. It was a warm apple pie that had vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was superb. I will defiantly be coming back with my family and friends. 3 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We always order out from here. I have not been a sit in customer yet, but their food is great. I am a huge fan of their pizza sauce."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Visited my sister who lives in PHX this past weekend and we tried out Spinato's after looking into a nice restaurant near her house in Ahwahtukee. This place had excellent reviews and was Italian which was what we were craving. We tried this out and was really happy with the food. They had an excellent children's menu that came with a gelato after which kept our children happy. They even gave us a toddler t-shirt for them both, it was really nice! Our server was very prompt and the service was great. The pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We will definitely be coming here more regular when we visit. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG... This place has THE BEST PIZZA...order the CHICAGO!  I'm a New York pizza snob, minimalist. The sauce has to stand on its own and this sweet San Marzano does. My husband is from Chicago and Phoenix now has so many Chicago eateries to choose from and they're all great, especially deep dish. Here we had a thin crust with their amazing sauce, great sausage, red onion with green and red peppers. Everything is really great quality...love the consistency of the crust that can hold up to the toppings with nice little crispy edges.  BUT NOTHING BEATS THEIR SAUCE!  Hubby and I both agree that SPINATO'S  PIZZA  is the VERY BEST!"}
{"text":"Immediately greeted with friendly people, we chose to sit in the bar instead of the dining area, but even the bar area was great. The pizza was amazing. The thin crust was damn good, bartenders were great. Even when we were leaving, the greeters were really friendly. Great food, great environment, will DEFINITELY be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Spinato's pizzeria is my go to place for pizza in AZ. I love this place and i love their pizzas they are awesome. I am not a good person when it comes to leftovers so i love that they have a personal pizza that serves exactly 1 person. This location is fancier than another one i went to, i just love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the establishments that my fiancé and I have been going to forever but I never reviewed. We LOVE this place! We just wish it was closer to our home so that they would deliver to us because it's about 35-40 minutes roundtrip driving. We've never eaten at the location - always takeout.   FYI - there is a separate door for takeout so it makes things easier. Also, get a extra side of marinara to dip your pizza in. Yum!   Our pizza order: Sicilian style spicy Italian pizza with peppercini's on half of the pizza. Get it - you won't regret it.   I'm a big fan of thin crust pizza but I won't get anything but the Sicilian style pizza here.    I've gotten the tiramisu here - like it but it's not my favorite. I can't say much about the other items on the menu because I stuff my face with the pizza and never want anything else."}
{"text":"This place was always a 5 star experience but the last two times it has been disappointing. We like the thin crust, extra crispy and these last two orders have proven that they either don't listen or they don't care.  Ill hit Grimaldi's the next few times and drive the extra 15 minutes.  Love the service, love the salads, love the pizza when it's extra crispy."}
{"text":"You better like your sauce sweet...  this sauce is a little too sweet.  Good thin crust good home made sausage.  Quality za.  Wish they added a bit of zest to the sauce.  Otherwise a real good pizza."}
{"text":"Their pizza is always so good! For some reason I can't get enough of the Greek salad. Thanks for a great dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to take my wife out for a date. The atmosphere was great, and the food was delicious. I had my best Hawaiian Pizza here that I had in a long time. The staff was very friendly and personal. The owner came by our table to check on us and even to small talk. Loved it, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my new Chicago style Pizza places in this area. Been driving past this restaurant for way too long and finally decided to stop in and give them a visit.  They have a pretty good selection of many of the Windy City's mouth watering favorites. Inside is cozy and decorated with a traditional pizza parlor theme. There is also a nice patio outside for when the weather is enjoyable. Perfect during the nicer times of the year.  Their menu here consist of Appetizers, Salads, Baked Sandwiches, Pastas and plenty of Pizzas and Calzones. If you leave here hungry you are in big trouble. We always have a good portion of leftover pizza to bring home. Great for a midnight snack or when you have those late night munchies.  Extremely friendly service. They will let you order your pizza and split it right down the middle. You can go crazy with two totally different kinds. They put a small line of sauce that shows you where it changes. Nice!  So far we have tried a 14\" Chicago on one side and the Combo version on the other. Came back a few weeks later and did a 14\" half Canadian with Nicole's Favorite on the other side. Great flavors with some really tasty ingredients. The pizza sauce here is a Chicago recipe and sweeter than what you would get at a NY pizza joint. So get ready and don't be surprised.  Can't wait to try out their Italian Beef Sandwich and maybe a Chicago Steak Calzone. They even have Dessert. Saw the Cannolis last time but had no more room and was ready to explode.  Bring the family and friends. They will make you feel right at home. Get the thin crust so you can eat more without getting filled up. They also have thick crust for you dough lovers out there. PIZZA TIME!  4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The service is friendly and competent.  The pizza is great.  This is a superior neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"This is going to be a dousey,  so stick with me for this... Nick and I really enjoy the food at Spinato's Pizzeria and figured it would be a nice treat to take our girls out for a nice dinner. We both understand that we have a good sized family, and we added 2 friends, which brought our dinner party to a nice 8 top. The staff at  Spinato's Pizzeria did not start out to a great start. They were busy, which was understandable, since it was 6ish, on a holiday weekend. I stood at the hostess stand for over 10 minutes, being completely ignored, by at least, 5 people, who stood directly in front of me, refusing to make eye contact, or even greet me. It wasn't until I  asked if I could be added to the list, that someone rudely obliged. They said our wait would be about 40 minutes. I was quite happy the wait was going to be under an hour since we have a 3, 5, 9, and 11 year old. It was super crowded and hot and one of the staff members even got us a few cups of water. We all patiently waited to be seated. The girls were great! They sang a few rounds of Spider Pig and were little angels. We were seated. It took us a few moments to get situated since we have more children than adults. The waitress approached our table with a giant stick up her ass. To be fair,  I get it. Sometimes I am even overwhelmed with our little family,  but, if you know my children,  they are extremely well behaved. I take great pride in being their parent. We placed our order. Nothing extravagant. It's pizza. It's what they do... Once again, our princesses patience, was being tested as we watched 2 family's place their orders after us, receive their food and leave. Our drinks were never offered to be refilled until we had to hunt the waitress down. We finally received our food and began to eat. Still no waitress... still no drinks. We had to get a busboy to hunt her down. She showed up to the table with an I don't have time for you attitude and rolled her eyes when we asked for refills. She then proceeded to put root beer in Pepsi and ignore one of the girls requests completely.  Again we had to hunt her down. She never apologized for her mistake and rolled her eyes again. She rudely asked if we needed boxes. By this time of the night, we are ready to go home. She brings the checks. She took my card and disappeared with it for quite some time and then ran around the restaurant without my card on her for quite some time. I'm not comfortable with waitstaff just leaving my card somewhere until she has time to deal with it. While I was waiting for the check to come back, Nick rounds up the kids and they all head to use the restroom before we leave. (This is the 6th time during our visit) The check comes back as Nick and the girls get back to the table. Nick gives me a weird look and says... No tip. We are NEVER coming back here again. I say ok and we head out the door. We said goodbye to our friends and start to walk to the car... Now this is where SHIT hits the fan... Nick knew best to get me out of the restaurant before he tells me this..   Nick is standing outside the girls bathroom, waiting for them to come out. At this time a MALE employee goes into the girls bathroom!  He never knocked. He never asked if anyone was using the restroom. He went into the woman's bathroom,  unannounced, and looked at my children weird, and didn't excuse him self and leave. This employee STAYED in the bathroom and began cleaning it!!!! While it was still occupied!  Nick was standing there the whole time trying not to lose his shit. The girls hightailed it out of the bathroom and were EXTREMELY uncomfortable!!!!   I went into Mama bear mode and started to walk back into Spinato's Pizza to bring the fear of God into these employees.  Luckily,  Nick was able to stop me. I  spoke with my girls and they are fine, just felt a little uncomfortable and knew to get of there. This is a MAJOR no no in my book. What if Nick wasn't standing there? Obviously we don't let the 3 and 5 year old go to the bathroom by themselves, and the older girls, 9 times out of 10 I have direct eyesight to the bathroom door and they never go alone. But why in the Hell does this employee think that this is acceptable!? If I was in the bathroom, shit would have hit the fan! Would he have even stayed in the bathroom if an adult was there?  One thing that I know for sure, we will NEVER be eating at this establishment again! I will be contacting management and corporate first thing in the morning, as well as many other agencies. This is not going to end well. I regret not going into the restaurant right when I found out, but this way I'll be more composed and able to see others colors, not just red. I know this didn't end horribly as the girls are safe. I just feel violated and vulnerable knowing that this even happened."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about eating GF pizza; the crust is the same no matter where you get it from and it's not that great.  Because of this, toppings are paramount. Spinato's has excellent sauce and high quality toppings. They make some of the best pizza in the valley.  They're also really consistent across all their locations; or at least the 3 I've tried (Tempe, Chandler, Phoenix)."}
{"text":"Nice smaller Resturant, staff was helpful and gracious. The Chicago calzone was really good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"As good a pizza as there is. Served piping hot and in good time Need a half order of garlic bread with mozzarella  so good . Service is great. One complaint sitting in bar the sun shining in is not good. Need outside canopies."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of another pizza joint that will remain nameless.  I have raved about how they have the best pizza I've ever had and was pretty sure that I'd never find another pizza that was as good.  Well, they've got stiff competition.  Spinato's has the best pizza I've ever had.  My husband is going to be so mad at me for that statement.    I've had the pleasure of eating the thin and thicker crust, both are good, but the thin is the best.    I'm a lucky gal to have them right across the street from my office..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love Spinato's...this location and all the others. I took my dad there and now he and I will ONLY go here for pizza. I've had tons of other pizza around the valley and the other places don't hold a candle to Spinato's. Whenever I have company in town, we go to Spinato's. I have yet to take someone there that is \"UNABLE\" to eat this pizza. And it's always busy...which says a lot, if the pizza was awful like some of the reviews I've read, it wouldn't be busy EVERY TIME that I've been there. I realize people have different taste buds but come on, Spinato's is not inedible by any means.   Thank you Spinato's for providing great pizza and great service! Keep up the great work and please don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, service not so much. I ordered take out at the bar and had a few beers while I waited.  When the time came to pay my bill, which was $50.30, I put out $60.30 consisting of three twenty dollar bills, expecting change. The bartender said thanks and walked away, never coming near my end of the bar again.  Guess it's still hard to find good help these days..."}
{"text":"I have Spinato's probably once a week. I live close by one of the locations. I've tried everything on the menu and I would give every dish 5 stars. The pizza, however, rises above the rest and is the best I have ever tried. The staff is very friendly and carry the attitude, or pride, that they own the restaurant. Never have I had a negative experience at Spinato's."}
{"text":"If I have an out-of-town guest visiting I always take them to Spinato's for the \"best pizza they will ever put in their mouth\". 9 out of 10 times they tell me \"this is the best pizza I have ever put in my mouth\". Oh, and the rest of the menu is just as good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Spinatos for over 20 years.  We've followed them all over town, to each location.  I would say with 100% certainty that this is the best pizza ever.  We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants.  They are great people.  We were excited to see the new Ahwatukee location open.  We were loyal to the Tempe location, but this new one is closer.  I love what they did with the old Chili's.  It is beautiful!  They really did a great job.   While my review of 5 stars is for the Company as a whole, I have to say that this new location is not my favorite and I probably won't return.   The food is amazing, that is not a problem.  I could eat Spinatos pizza and food everyday for the rest of my life.  But this location lacks the family feel that I'm used to.  On both occasions that I've gone here, I've received poor service.  The wait times for a table are grossly underestimated.  I was told 30 minutes (at an off peak time), and it was 65 minutes later that I got a table.  Our waters were never refilled and we didn't see our server until we flagged her down to get our check.    While this location is beautiful and I'm so happy for the family, I won't be back there.  I'll keep going to the \"hole in the wall\" Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family, and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years.    I"}
{"text":"Spinato's is definitely worth a try!  Especially if you are new to the area and looking for a midwest/Chicago style pizza.  Since moving here a month ago, the only other pizza we have had is Rustic Pizza.  It was very good, but falls into a different category as far as comparison goes.    Like lots of the other reviews, the sauce is on the sweet side.  But once you add in the cheese, seasonings, and toppings, the sauce doesn't stand out or seem overwhelming.  We kept our first visit simple with a thin crust medium (14 inch) pizza, an order of breadsticks (4), and a pitcher of beer.  That was more than enough food for 2 people and left us with a few pieces to take home too! I think that the total tab was around $30. (I think there is a special on pitcher of beers on Thursdays.)  Initially, we had planned on ordering for delivery, but some of the reviews said that the pizza was soggy by the time they received it.  When the pizza was served to us in the restaurant, it was placed on a baking rack to help keep the crispness of the thin crust.   Our server was great too.  Very polite and fast!    I can't comment on the wait because we arrived fairly early for dinner and there were maybe a few other diners there as well.  I could imagine that the place gets packed quickly though.  So glad that we decided to stop here and try it.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner at spinatos last night. Great, family style restaurant in a good indoor/outdoor location. Food was tasty and the service was good too. Thanks"}
{"text":"First let me say we LOVE Spinatos pizza. It is one of the best in the Valley. However, this particular location has continued to have slow service. People always seem stressed because they are understaffed. This has been going on for awhile. In fact we visited for lunch today and there was one waiter taking care of the whole restaurant. He seemed like a great waiter, just too much to do. If you want a great food and great service go to the Bell and 16th street or one of the other locations."}
{"text":"Spinato's just opened in Ahwatukee and you would think it was the first and only restaurant this side of South Mountain from all of the people there.  The place was packed!  However, it was our lucky day when our friends got there just in time to get us a prime spot at a bar table!  There were servers and staff everywhere, so even though the confusion of opening night was obvious, everyone was having a great time and there were plenty of people helping out so it didn't really matter.  We ordered a few appetizers and four personal (7\") pizzas.    The Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome!  Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce (that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust, so ask for a side) for only $3.99!  The BF had the \"Here's the Beef\" pizza which looked meaty and delicious.  I probably would have had a bite, but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings (feta, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, spinach, and tomatoes) that I didn't want anything to mess with the flavors.  Every day is a different daily drink special and $2 PBR all day, every day.  I would say that I can't wait for the place to calm down so I can go back, but to be honest, I don't really care.  I'll go back even if it is just as busy as opening night.  The food was wonderful, the service was great, and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of.    The only bad part about Spinato's opening in the Tuke is going to be deciding which of my favorite pizza joints I'm going to pick on any given night!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least a good 30-40 times in the last 2 years. Most of the time the service is great and fast. We had to wait or a bit neglected a few times. We have tried a lot of their items and they are mostly good or ok. The staff is very friendly, we can recognize most of them but they usually don't remember us, which is fine.  The reason we used to come often is because we live within walking distance and it's convenient.   We really like the mama spinach pizza or combo pizza, the salads are good too. There are a few items such some salad dressing, a couple of pizza and a couple  pasta dishes we tried that we did not like at all. We have only stuck to pizzas' then. The thin crust is the one to eat, not the thick one. They only have pepsi products which is fine but we like Coke best.   Their sweet sauce is great. Some items are really good but some taste like from a can. Their canoli was decent for the first 3 times then they started coming either empty (no filing inside) or just tasting like a sweet cheese. So we don't do canoli's anymore but I know they cookies are good.   Their Gluten Free pizza is not very good a bit too expensive. Buon Gusto down the street has the best GF pizza and very reasonably priced.  Some of their staff is not well informed on Gluten free items or items in their menu. It's important for the staff to be knowledgeable when it comes to food allergy and the contents of the menu they work in. I would not trust GF items here as I didn't feel confident that they understand it.    We think ourselves to be good clients as we sometimes eat here on a weekly basis.  But recently, I order a combo pizza with the thick crust (trying first time) and we did not like the crust at all. However, the main problem was that somehow there were two pieces of chicken bones about 2 inches long mixed in with the cheese and other veggies. My husband hurt his mouth with one of the hard chicken bone pieces.   We brought the entire pizza back (minus 2  1/2 slices) and they credited us the pizza and said a manager would call us next day. We never received a call or feedback. We never finished our lunch. We ended up after returning the pizza having to take the family to in-n-out as a fast solution since we had run out of lunch time. Very inconvenient to have to drive back to bring the pizza back and receive a half apology and then have to go find lunch somewhere else.   We haven't eaten there since then. :(   Pomo is the best pizza in Phoenix but way too far for us. So we are still looking for a decent place for our pizza fix.  We just wish spinatos would be less careless for its customers and food they serve."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I had been told that the pizza was great. But our pizza was very soggy and dripping with grease. I didn't particularly like that the sauce was so sweet but I could have forgiven that if the rest of the pizza had been good. There was also no crust and the pizza was cut into diagonal pieces so it was very hard to hold (the soggy slices didn't help). After this experience, I was told that their thick crust is better. I may give it another try since it's so close by."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places! We happened along this place by accident while enjoying a \"stay-cation\" at a local resort. We were starving and not looking to pay resort prices for dinner. A quick little drive and we saw a sign that said pizza. The best accident we had!  Location is in a strip mall and not terribly inviting, but go anyway because once you hit the front door it's like you walked into a friends house. Great smell from the kitchen and a small little bar with plenty of good beverages and cold beer.  So take a look at the menu, ask for suggestions. The sausage is homemade and fantastic. My favorite crust is the thinner \"crispier\" crust. and there is no expense spared on toppings smothering edge to edge. So if you like to actually enjoy your toppings & sauce not just get a mouthful of dough this is your place.   Word of warning, everything is big! The small salad easily feeds three & do try the garlic ranch dressing. The spaghetti is good, with homemade meatballs and the sauce...well let's just say the sauce is more of a sweet sauce full of taste and not just tomato paste. So our favorite pizza has quickly become the peperoni & sausage. We like to add sweet peppers too. But really you can go wrong. And even the Margarita pizza is outstanding.   We have dined in & they deliver. Just got to the website & place a web order. Pizza was here in no time.   I love taking out of town friends & family here because it is local owned & operated. A great family place and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pizza here. The meatballs are a must try as well. I can't believe it took me so long to find such a great pizza place. Staff was awesome and helpful and the food came out super fast. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of a local neighborhood mom-and-pop pizza place. Spinatos is where I go when I'm craving thin crust pizza! Their restaurant has a very cozy feel inside and small outdoor patio. It's always packed inside but I've never had to wait longer than a few minutes. Their pizza selection is awesome with a variety of size and topping combinations. I've actually only tried their thin crust but I'm sure their regular crust is just as delicious! I always get the chicago pizza with bell peppers and italian sausage. All the toppings and cheese are fresh and tasty. They have awesome deals for different days of the week. I like going on Wed for half off bottles of wine. They also have lunch club where they send you coupons every month! Service is also top notch and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Ok, we love their pizza but the customer experience for a to-go order is essentially like playing the slots in Vegas.  First time ever calling in a pizza order.  Started at 6:10pm, now it's 6:25 and I am on hold on both land line and cell.  Initially the automated system said I was #1 in the queue.  Then someone picked up the line and disconnected. Called back and now I am #5.  Waited and when answered asked for a manager. Janelle spoke to me and was attentive.  Advised her of the situation and she said they had just switched over to new phone system because previously customers would get buzy signal.  Told her 2x's when I had tried back it told me all lines buzy and sent me to voicemail.  After she advised the wait time for the order was 45min. we passed and opted for the competition.  Obviously they have enough customers."}
{"text":"Wonderful,  we had a crisp antipasto salad and a margarita and sausage/black olive pizza.  The crust has a crisp edge and thin ish middle.  The sauce is delish."}
{"text":"Really really thought this was going to be a shining five star review.  Ordered the cheese artichoke bread appetizer and it was freaking amazing.....so so good. Then a Greek side salad that was so big two people could split it.  It was awesome....best Greek salad ever.  The ordered pizza with all the meats. Came out all perfect, beautiful baked crust, elevated on a rack so it stays crispy.  First bite....so good but something wasn't right.  The sauce has so much sugar in it.  It was ridiculous.   Moved on to the spaghetti with vodka sauce with homemade sausage.  The sausage was great.  The sauce was so sweet it was unedible. So sweet it was almost sickening.  I really had high hopes after the ratings but it makes me realize people do not know what makes good Italian food.   My grandmother used to have a stock pot on the stove for the entire day or longer letting the sauce simmer and develop flavors and a body that would compliment the entree it was on.   Note to everyone: marinara does not have a 1 to 1 tomato and sugar ratio."}
{"text":"Well seems they were closed for some reason. But there was an older person inside that had no problem knocking on the window as we put down something on there door so we could pull out our phones and see where else we could go eat lunch.  We were going to trash it after (I was going to make sure of it). No talking other then to bitch about what we had done and make sure it was removed. No information or sorry they were closed. Shame as I'm a local and had 3 new co-workers who wanted to try this usually great  place. Great 1st image you created for yourself and for the Valley with this attitude!! Even I might think twice now before going to this location maybe even all locations. Time to hire people who know customer service even if you were closed a \"I'm sorry we are closed due to.... We hope to welcome you back soon\" would of been a nice touch. Not happy."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I'm always in search of good gluten free pizza. I have not found one until tonight. Not only was it very tasty, but reasonably priced as well. I loved the fact that the crust was thin and crispy. My boyfriend could not tell that it was gluten free, which he is quite the food critic. I will defiantly return here."}
{"text":"For an actual sit down pizza restaurant I don't think I've been to a better one in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love this place! My family and I have been going to this location for the past 3yrs. The food is so good, pasta, pizza and the variety of drinks. The best part is the happy hour menu from 2 to 6 which includes some of their specialty pizzas , meat balls (tasty, huge meatballs) and wings.The price is right for a family of 5. Let's go back to the pizza. Its thin and crispy and oooohh so tasty we usually get 2, Get Meaty and Mama's Spinato's. The Margherita pizza is awesome but not on the happy hour menu, it is a must have.  The service is great, we did have several hiccupes once the waiters said our order was not submitted, we caught it because the table next to us received their food before us and they were seated after we were. They were very apologetic about the situation. On another visit my husband found a piece glass in his beer. The manager did come to our table to apologize without us having to ask for him and then check on us a 2nd time. This impressed us since usually management doesn't get involved until they have to. The restaurant is very clean and well maintained and the food is awesome! This is a must try no matter how far away you are from the different locations. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The food is fabulous love love love the seafood basilico!! Jason is almost always our server he knows how much I love the food here and how much I love there ice tea today he brought me my own special iced tea!  Talk about knowing you customers!!!"}
{"text":"So after calling in 50 minutes ago and being quoted a 20 minute ready time, here I sit. Waiting on my pizza. I'm not sure why I continue to frustrate myself time after time by ordering Spinatos pizza. If this were a one time incident I could understand. Long waits happen every time!  I might be able to look past it if it weren't for the lack of customer service and non-friendly approach each time I come to this specific location. No one ever seems to be bothered that you've waited longer than quoted and no one takes responsibility.  Tonight I was told there's a new girl in the kitchen and she's not keeping them up on times. What about the last two times I've been in? Is there a new employee each time I call in an order?  I really enjoy the pizza here and it's convenient that I live five minutes away but today may be my final visit here."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than this pizza place. We've  been coming here for years and I can't get enough. Amazing pizza, salad, and appetizers. If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant that isn't an over-the-top this will be it.  They have the best pizza in Phoenix as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Ive only eaten here once but it was amazing!! The service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious. I will find my way back here for sure."}
{"text":"Spinatos has great pizza. We usually get the super 6 and it's great. Their sauce is sweet and overall the pizza can get a bit heavy because the ingredients can be salty with the sweet sauce. You crave it every once in a while but you can't have it too often.  I think it's gotten heavier through out the years but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza they put a nice family touch on there pies. The red sauce is a little to sweet but good. They have a awesome spinach style pizza which is great and a Italian beef calzone is worth a try"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the great state of Arizona! Enough said"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The service is always great, the gluten free options are plentiful."}
{"text":"OK, having just arrived back from NYC, and having just experienced Lombardi's there (which is supposedly world famous), it is NOT as good as Spinato's.  This is my third or fourth taste of heaven, as we often order pizza for our office crew, and each time it has been fantastic!  Granted, I stick with the plain old pepperoni or sausage pizza, so others may not be as tasty.  Doesn't matter 'cause I LOVE it!"}
{"text":"OSicilian style sausage, mushroom and onion with O'Dells IPA.  Pizza- meh! Envisioned canned tomato paste on yeasty focaccia.  Lucky to taste the onion, as sausage and mushroom was nil. Despite the mediocre pizza (at an inflated price at that) the vibe was pleasant for lunch meetings and after work wind-down.  The beers were frosty, micro, and cheap- and the service was excellent  we'll come back once more to try the thin crust.  I'll be sure to ask for extra mushrooms and sausage."}
{"text":"Spinatos has some of the best pizza in the valley. This location is always extremely busy so we almost always order carry out. We've tried almost all of their combinations and have never been disappointed. Some favorites include: get meaty and the roasted Fennel and Italian sausage. Salads are good, but nothing spectacular. Haven't tried any of the other dishes or deserts. If you are in the mood for pizza you won't be disappointed coming here!"}
{"text":"This has to be our family's favorite place for pizza hands down! Sauce and flavors are amazing. I love the meatball, spinach and garlic pizza the best. Staff always friendly too."}
{"text":"Visited this location of Spinato's yesterday for a late lunch. They say, \"The 3rd times a Charm.\" Apparently, whom ever came up with that statement never ate at this franchise. It was actually my intent to go to Pita Jungle, which is next to Spinato's. but, it was so Dayum hot outside, I ducked into Spinato's instead of walking the extra 50 yards to PJ. I should have sucked it up, dealt with the blazing sun and continued walking past Spinato's. This was my 3rd time in this joint, and I am certain now, that the food here is just NOT good. I ordered the penne pasta with Italian sausage. Although the penne pasta was only a tad bit over cooked, it was the thick paste like sauce that was sweet as candy, and the 4 or 5 day old Italian sausage sprinkled into the mix, that made me just want to pick all those little slices out, and toss them to the pigeons, (that made this dining experience my last one here). BUT, sitting inside at the bar, made that whim an impossibility. I could go on, but WHY! I will NEVER EVER, eat here again!"}
{"text":"As a former NYer, I am pretty biased.  But I have to say that it was pretty good (for AZ Pizza).  Haha.  No seriously, I would go back.  I had a calzone (you have to ask for Ricotta to be added to it, which I thought was a little weird) but it was actually really good.  Friends with me ordered a Pizza and it looked ok - not like NY Pizza, but everyone seemed happy.  We were there for lunch during work and the service was great.  Never a dirty plate or an empty glass.  Would def recommend this place again."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. The frustrating part is the hours. They close at 8pm on Sundays and 9pm on weekends. I guess that's they're business model. Seems they're leaving money on the table and hungry customers."}
{"text":"I did have a bad delivery experience (order taker put the wrong address in entirely, order was severely delayed). But the food itself is AMAZING. I now do take-away orders regularly bc my family doesn't like any other pizza!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after hearing/reading the rave reviews. Soggy crust, toppings were very sparse, and it was really greasy. For the price too, I expected more. Back to 25th Ave & Thunderbird Barro's for us!"}
{"text":"Someone suggested trying their pizza , we are new to the area so we thought we give it a try. Originally we were going to dine in but it was busy for a Sunday evening at 7, so we decided to go next door and order pizza to go. It was opening night of NFL football so it was busy. Pizza deliveries were running 1 hour 45 minutes. So we placed an order for 2 pizzas. Approx wait 45 minutes. So they said they put a rush, which was fine. It was well worth the wait we ordered a meaty meat and a cheese, they were delicious ! Very flavorful thin crust pizza .  The cheese was real! The box absorbed the grease but it was well worth the wait. Definitely  will go back. They also offer par baked pizza too, so you can finish cooking at home, but it was already late so we chose to have it fully cooked. Next time I may take home a jar of their sauce too. Very good pizza!"}
{"text":"Spinatos has the best pizza in Phoenix by far! The sauce is delicious and the mamas signature spinach pizza is amazing! I can't resist the canoli for dessert, yum!!!"}
{"text":"I really am surprised this restaurant doesn't have a better overall rating. Of all the \"non-gourmet\" pizza places in town, this is by far my favorite. The sauce is delicious and to me that makes the pizza. I also really enjoy their caprese salad which uses heirloom tomatoes and is dressed perfectly. Delivery fee is a reasonable $2.50. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Really really good pizza. I love how they cut it in little squares. Nicely sauced and cheesy. We had a Hawaiian pizza with cheesy bread and marinara. My daughter had the kids spaghetti (she's 15 but loves pasta!). Server was friendly and attentive. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that the dining room was a little cramped. But everyone had a smile on their face. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our early Saturday evening visit here.  Parking lot was packed when we pulled in.  Was told it would be 20 minute wait but it was only ten minutes before we were seated.  Promptly served drinks.  Iced tea went down smoothly.  Really good.    We ordered the 16 inch Super Six  \"Italian sausage, pepperoni, ham, mushrooms, mixed green & red sweet bell peppers, mozzarella\" and had pineapple added as an addition.  Absolutely delicious!!    Couldn't resist finishing our meal with the brownie desert.  OMG so good.  Service was prompt and courteous.  I highly recommend Spinato's for great pizza."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress. The wait was a bit long but the pizza was worth it! The sweet sauce is delicious and a welcomed difference compared to other pizza places. Try the vanilla bean gelato alone or on any of the desserts!"}
{"text":"Love love their spaghetti calzones...the sauce is not too tangy and they add just enough cheese and the dough/ crust is baked just right."}
{"text":"If you're searching for the perfect pizza, this is it! Spinato's has amazing thin crust and the best pizza sauce. It's definitely a Phoenix must. The only downside is that wait times can be long on weekend nights--but it's definitely a good sign of how delicious the food is!"}
{"text":"My husband has been bringing home a calzone from work to home in GoldCanyon for years from Spinato's and it's always been very tasty. Today we dined in and had a meatball mushroom calzone and was one of the best I've eaten. Just enough sauce to compliment the perfect crust. Rob our server was very attentive and helpful in recommending the best way to purchase and get a calzone to go when you have such a distance to go. I will continue to get them to go but definitely the best way to appreciate their calzone is to dine in."}
{"text":"I liked the  previous  location better . They had us wait for 20 minutes  when the restaurant  was only half full. We ordered their cheesy bread. Which was good but could have used more garlic. We ordered their pizza.  It was a little  salty. I do like the crust however I was eating  my salad first and it got a little  soggy. Salad was nice and large and I was able to share. The service was average . We had to ask for refills"}
{"text":"10/06/2017 1st time dining at that restaurant.Pizza sauce and dough has good flavor. Wings were Delicious and good size. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather and atmosphere. Server was kind of Slow but the food made up for it. We will be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best thin crust pizza in the Phoenix area, maybe all of Arizona! The sauce is sweeter than you'd expect, but it goes rather well.  We always order extra crispy.  They run the crust through once, then load the toppings and run it through again.  This results in a crispy crust all the way through.  Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6.24 and request  a table for three . There was a quoted 30 minute wait however  the restaurant  had empty tables. We were seated in 23 minutes  however  the host did not realize  that the ground  had water all on the ground  . We stood while  he mopped  the ground. We were hungry . They took our order after 5 minutes which was good . However  the pizza did not get to our table for 45 minutes  which was too long . They came and apologize  three times but offered nothing for our wait . We asked for take out boxes and this took another  7 minutes  all in all two hours  for dinner. The food was good  but we were very unhappy  with the wait.  I don't think we will  be  going back soon"}
{"text":"If you are looking for pizza on the sweeter side with friendly servers this place stays consistent in its tastyness!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat...wonderful happy hour! We've tried several items on the menu. GOOD STUFF!!!"}
{"text":"unreal Just went in tonight ....an hour before closing and waiting up front to be seated.  Was there for five minutes and just couldn't believe in that amount of time someone couldn't even acknowledge my existence.  I could understand if it were during a rush but there was not many there and two servers noticed us but didn't didn't say a word...sad"}
{"text":"I've visited a couple times with family and I'm not a fan of pizza. (Yeah, yeah, I know) I ordered a pasta which, for me, wasn't the best but my sister's pizza was awesome!  The sauce is a little on the sweet side, but it's really good.  If I knew about this pizza, I would've ordered from there sooner!"}
{"text":"I have never been here before. Was given a recommendation. Went out for dinner with friends who recommended this place. I got to say it was small but very good food. Loved the stuffed mushrooms. We never made dessert. Had pizza and salad was to die for. I will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Had an order to go . I had their beef Sandwich. They add a a lot of picked peppers on top of the beef the beef is so moist and portions so llarve that I can make two meals out of it . The last order had a little too mu h peppers and the. One car was o overwhelming"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but how do u screw up a simple pizza delivery? I even called back to CONFIRM the delivery address and my name , delivery address and phone number in case there was a single issue? How do u screw this up!!!! I called a third time to ask where our pizza was ...since we are opening a new optometry office and our kids are here hungry...while we unpack and organize.  When I called a third time asking where our orde was...I shockingly was told it was attempted and no one answered!!! Omg!!!! We have been here all night!!!!! I went with Spinnatos because their food is good...but I'm pretty sure papa Johns would have at least been here as promised...with food for our family and not made excuses for idiot staff manning the phones and screwing up orders...never ordering from here again.  Called a fourth time to ask where our food was...now an how and a half late....I'm now told its on way...yet girl who answered on my forth call to confirm delivery address gave me the wrong address yet again!!! This is rediculous and impressive..."}
{"text":"My kids certainly loved dinner 2 thumbs up! And my husband and I pleased! Good prices and great food and wonderful service from Ashly. It was our first time here and we will certainly be back. Awesome that we found this place. I ask myself, why did I take so long to visit this place? Lol"}
{"text":"Went back Saturday for lunch, Oh my... so good..Ordered the same as last time expect on our pizza our waitress recommended to put onions on it...she was right that was gooooooood.  Hubby and me fought over the leftovers that night...hehe...   so good.."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were greeted by the girls at the front - very friendly, nice atmosphere all around, though too many kids for my taste. So yes, this is a kid-friendly restaurant, which unfortunately translates to mediocre food at best. That is exactly what we got.  There are two elements that are crucial to making a good pizza and making a pizzeria stand out from the others: The sauce and the crust. Spinato's failed on both of these counts.  We ordered the pizza and when it was served it looked delicious. After the first bite is when everything went downhill. The sauce, as stated by many people, was sweet and plain - not a hint of Italian seasoning in it. I was prepared for this, and before the pizza was even served I asked the waiter for Italian seasoning. He looked confused. So I said, oregano. He brought a ramekin with a sparse amount (I guess they need to save those pennies).   This did not save the pizza because of crucial element no. 2: The crust that wasn't there. I am serious, the crust was pure air, nothing to it. Wonder Bread has more substance and heartiness to it than their crust had. I have never in my life, including any frozen pizza I've ever eaten, had a more tasteless, pathetic pizza crust than what was delivered. My friend, who doesn't have a keen sense for good food, said \"well maybe it wasn't in the oven long enough\".  Nonsense, the quality was cheap and anyone with taste buds can recognize it.   Shame on Spinato's for being so cheap to serve pizza with dough that isn't nearly half the quality of Pizza Hut ( I was dreaming of Pizza Hut the whole time I was eating their pizza)."}
{"text":"I was well pleased with the Chicken Parmesan, tender and just the right amount of sauce. I had the red velvet chocolate cake desert, it was delicious and satisfyingly perfect. My waitress was courteous, warm and friendly. She seemed genuinely happy to make my experience a excellent one. The ambiance and layout makes this restaurant ideal for all dining occasions large parties and intimate get togethers. The service puts this place over the top."}
{"text":"Great family dining location.  There were twelve family members (four children), and we were celebrating an adult birthday. There appeared to be two other large parties seated in the restaurant, but for some reason we didn't have clearly as much elbow room as them (they were seated at tables with benched seating.) Although, it was a bit crowded our server made us feel welcomed.   We ordered pizza, calzones and pasta; I had Shrimp Vino Blanco. The food was very good. And the mojito was perfect. They even brought our birthday boy (man) a calzone with a candle.  Thank you Spinato's!"}
{"text":"While I've never had a bad meal here, I just attempted to order delivery and what a fiasco. I think they are going to have to train the associates on this a bit more. Took me 15 mins and 2 calls to place an order for delivery. The Super Six is my fave and it's always hot and fresh. The dine-in customer service is also spotty, but the food makes up for it. Food 4 stars, Service 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! We thought we loved grimaldis (we still do!) and that was our go to pizza, then we went and had spinats (our nick name for it) and were blown away! It is the valleys BEST pizza, and for how often we get it, it never disappoints.. We usually get it to go since my boyfriend works in ahwatukee and can just grab it on his way home to chandler , but when we have date nights there we have never had a bad experience! Of course we have only sat in the bar area but I love it, the decor, comfy chairs and even booths just have a nice vibe for hanging out. Also their drinks are to die for! I love going and ordering drinks and just hanging out watching the football game on a Sunday afternoon.   Definitely a must go to place! Also you haven't had a real cannoli until you have had their cannoli!"}
{"text":"Our meetup group came here on a Saturday evening and in spite of our organizer coming way ahead of time as advised so the group could secure a table, it still took about an hour before we were seated. My friend and I went to the bar to get appetizers while the group waited outside. The bar atmosphere was good and we got served right away. When our group finally got seated it still took a while before we got the food that we ordered. The food was good as I had expected, having dined in the Tempe location and in this establishment's former Phoenix location. But I am surprised that there could be such a lack of coordination and organization in service, considering that the restaurant had opened in this location some time back."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I finally found yet another pizzeria that offers gluten-free options for pizza and other items. The gluten-free pizza crust is made by GFC (Gluten Free Creations, one of my fave GF establishments in the city). Tucked in a quiet commercial strip, the place has a very casual vibe and very friendly service. The sauce tends to lean a bit toward the sweet side, but pleasantly so, in my opinion. Nice to know that I have a cool place to reward myself after a hike at nearby Lookout Mountain."}
{"text":"The supreme pizza is packed with topping and very thin crust. Terrific pizza and around $15 for a large. Great combo"}
{"text":"This is our absolute go to pizza place.  Their cheesy garlic bread is absolutely the best, and a good appetizer before pizza! Their caprese salad comes with the most colorful tomatoes that it's almost a shame to eat it (almost!) If you like a good calzone - they have 3 good choices and my favorite is the beef and ricotta that you dip in au jus - yummo! Their pizza - oh man - they have tons of choices but we always go for the Get Meaty and Da Greek. Yum! And their sandwiches - the best hot sandwiches around if that is what you're looking for.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Spinato's is the favorite pizza spot for my wife and me in the entire Valley. We do occasionally get pizza elsewhere, but we spend most of our time at Spinato's for the genuine Chicago-style thin crust pizza and the amazing garlic cheese bread. Being from Chicago, I can be fussy when it comes to places that call their pizza \"Chicago style.\" Spinato's, which began in Chicago, does not disappoint. The rich, flavorful sauce is unique and oh so good. To my meat-loving friends like me: You will be amazed at how good the two specialty \"signature\" veggie pizzas are here. I have never eaten a pizza with nothing but vegetables on it that I thought tasted all that special. These are amazing, so if you are with someone who only wants to eat vegetables, come here, and you will not feel like you missed out on something. But if nothing but meat will do, you absolutely must try the meatball sandwich. Holy cow. It's usually huge and dripping with sauce and cheese. The tastiest meatball sandwich around. The best part? Spinato's has the best happy hour deal, with small specialty pizzas for only nine dollars, appetizers for only four dollars, and drink specials. My wife and I frequently get a small specialty pizza, two side salads, and the garlic cheese bread, and we leave with our stomachs full for less than $25 complete. Although we go to the 16th St. and Bell Road location most frequently because it is the closest location to us, we have also eaten at the Scottsdale location as well as the 7th Street and Missouri location. The quality of the food is exactly the same wherever you go, but the 7th St. and Missouri location is the largest with the best ambience."}
{"text":"Sadly, I am a pizza fanatic. The only reason to workout is to make room for pizza. Spinato's is my favorite in the Valley. I think its the slightly sweet sauce and the thin crust. I can't say much about anything else but the thin crust pizza. Never stayed to eat, and have never ordered anything else. Staff has always been friendly on the phone and in the door. Pizza has ALWAYS been consistent.  If they ever start making wings I am in real trouble."}
{"text":"My favorite sauce of Pizza in the Valley. It's a little pricey but definitely a great Pizzza."}
{"text":"FABULOUS Chicago-style authentic everything!!!  Tho the pizza and meatballs are wonderful, I also go for the antipasto salad, which is the best I've EVER had, and it's a total meal with food left over to take home!!  If there are two of you, get the large and share it - it's huge!   Garlic bread/sauce just doesn't get any better than this...and atmosphere is very friendly, family-like, and service is TOPS every time we go!"}
{"text":"Excellent sausage pizza and garlic cheese bread.  They use high quality ingredients and both items were perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be telling friends and business associates to eat here!!"}
{"text":"What is better than Spinato's delivery? The service & follow-up you get. When a mix-up occurred on an order, I called them to bring attention to the matter. On what had to be an incredibly busy night (Friday, Sweet 16 round), they re-delivered in about 15 minutes. I love their pizza almost as much as their service!"}
{"text":"Pretty inconsistent, you can flip a coin weather tonight will be great or subpar. Lots of new competitors in the area - they should spend some time tidying up. When the pizza is on its really good."}
{"text":"I give the pizza five stars .. I didn't get to try any of the other food .. but the atmosphere is warm and inviting . I'm letting my family friends and acquaintances know . if they want some place to eat..  it's like going to Nana Grandma's Kitchen"}
{"text":"Tried to call in an order for pickup after a family event tonight for dinner and was put on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up and called back to see if they forgot about me?  I was told \"we are too busy right now.\" This sucks because this is one of our favorite pizza places. We have family in town visiting and everyone was looking forward to eating pizza."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is good but get it to go. From the wait staff to the hostess and even at the to go counter I have found everyone to be less than friendly. I was picking up food to go once with my fiancé (around $40) and he noticed they sell vodka sauce. When asked if we could try some we were told we would have to buy a jar of it. I called to see if they take reservations because my uncle wanted to go there for his birthday. There was 12 in my party. But you can not make a reservation and as I asked a few more questions I kept having to repeat myself because her answer did not make sense. If she just would have listened to me rather than playing around with whoever was next to her, the phone call could have been much less frustrating."}
{"text":"OMG, the GF Mamma's Signature Pizza is to die for. I almost don't want to tell anyone. I add a couple pizza items to it. We are so hooked that if I could eat there 3 times a week and not get really big, I would."}
{"text":"Recently had take-out from this location. (2) orders of spaghetti Bolognese, garlic bread, and a house salad. EXCELLENT!! great portion size and wonderful flavor. Really nice staff who assisted me. No complaints. We will definitely be back, only this time to dine in!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Spinatos for years now. We have come to know most servers and have felt like family there until recently. Lately, the kids portions have been lessened to 18 noodles (which doesn't even cover the bottom of the bowl). Even though we've been told to order more noodles, which we have, the attitudes by the managers have really resulted from us NOT being a customer any longer. We were were told it may not be the place for us. I'm not sure what type of management says that to its frequent guests? We love Spinatos and it's servers, so for a manager to say this so abruptly really threw  my friends and I off.  Upper management got involved with no resolution except for to speak with the same woman who told us to leave. This is really sad because this is our place we always went to; however, we will not be cheated out of our money for small portions and disrespectful managers. This manager is new and will not see our business anymore. I am really disappointed on how the owners of Spinatos chose to handle this situation. I have owned a restaurant business before and the customer is always top priority."}
{"text":"I really liked this new location and enjoyed the pizza as much as always. I had the mushroom pizza and it was great, One my companions had a personal pizza and the consensus was that it had a digiorno like taste so stick with the medium pizza or larger. Their homemade cookies are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Used their take out services - pizza and spaghetti.  Both were terrible.  Took a few bites and threw the rest away.  What a waste of good money"}
{"text":"When we first walked in we were wowed by the look of the restaurant completely beautiful! We got greeted and seated right away our waitress was very attentive and nice. We started off with drinks which were very delicious then came the appetizer Cesar salad was alright but the wings and ranch were delicious. We ordered a large extra pepperoni pizza, it came out and looked so amazing I could not wait to eat it. This pizza did not taste as good as it looked. I felt like the sauce was way too sweet, I had to coat my pizza in pepper flakes to try and get that overwhelming sweet taste off of it. I don't think we'll ever return again. Complete fail, but the service was amazing. Thumbs down for the pizza."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, how haven't I been to Spinato's before?! I honestly didn't realize they were a local pizza place until just a few months ago. We ordered carry out and really loved their pizzas. We went for their thin and crispy crust and my favorite part was the sauce! I don't even know how to explain it - it is kind of more along the lines of tomato paste but in a good way and just so dang rich and tasty.   We ordered one of their Margherita pizzas that had tomato, mozzarella, EVOO, and fresh basil and the second one was their famous Mamma's signature fresh spinach that had red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, and garlic. Yum!!!   We'll definitely be back to try other varieties because I'm a fan of thin crust pizza and Spinato's didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. We drive quite a distance to get here BTW, open a store in Cave Creek ;) Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and garlic bread. The chicken alfredo is good also. Good happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Spinato's has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though.  This restaurant was a Chili's before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable.  Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu."}
{"text":"Recently had to sit through six days of software presentations at work, two days from each Supplier. Interesting albeit long days of technical jargon mixed with real world scenarios.  The upside was that each of the Suppliers provided lunch each day.  It's been said that the way to a mans heart is through his stomach and some of the Suppliers pulled out all of the stops.  Honestly, my heart sank when I heard we were having pizza the last day.  We'd been treated to some really tasty food the previous five days and my mind now imagined having to choke down some Hut or Dominos.  Boy was my world rocked!  I had heard about Spinatos but had never had it.  Welcome to the Top Five with a bullet!  ((Maybe top three). This pizza is absolutely some of the finest in Phoenix or anywhere for that matter (and Phoenix is becoming known for having some fo the best pizza in the country).  I couldn't stop eating this addictive pizza!  My colleagues probably thought I hadn't eaten in weeks the way I kept going back to get more.  The sauce and hand-tossed crust were perfect together and the toppings were varied from the standard meats to a fantastic veggie with feta cheese. In the week since this meal, I've honestly had dreams abut this pizza-it's that good!  I know pizza is highly personal but Spinatos is truly worth a shot if you love pizza."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm!  Gluten free pizza at its best. The sauce is delicious and the crust was tasty and had a nice texture.  We arrived early and were fortunate to order our food at happy hour prices. We had salad, pizza, garlic bread and a beer for $25!!!   (Before tip)."}
{"text":"The pizza calzone is amazing!!! Get it with ricotta. You can also get it with their vodka cream sauce! The pizza is delicious too!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday evening. It was packed, but we only waited for a minute before being seated. the service was fast. The staff was polite. The pizza was very good. I wouldnt say that it was the best that I ever had.... because Deluca's Pizza in Lansing, Michigan is the best.... but overall, we were very pleased with Spinatos. We will definately return."}
{"text":"Pizza is always amazing here- our favorite is the roasted fennel and sausage. Tonight we visited this location and unfortunately I left my wallet on the table that had $300 in it. When I went back for it within 30 minutes- only $100 was in my wallet. I asked to speak to the manager and he immediately defended his employees and basically called me a liar. As much as I can appreciate the manager sticking up for his employees- please convey this message to your staff the night of 7-1-17; I lost my job 5 weeks ago and felling depressed, my husband treated me to a night out. I hope the person (s) needed the money more than I did.  This customer is not a liar but a hard working person trying to hold on to what little she has left- thanks for the great pizza but can't support your organization for this awful and detrimental experience- the manager was such a jerk and made me feel like I was the criminal, great job on hiring non consumer centric leaders"}
{"text":"This is our very favorite pizza in the valley. We drive 30 minutes to pick it up, and it's always worth it. We've only tried the pizza so I can't attest to any other menu items, but the thin crust, sauce, to toppings ratio is always spot on. I can't say enough good things about the sauce...it's the best I've ever had! The pizza always tastes fresh and delicious. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The pizza itself is three star worthy. It wasn't bad, but certainly not my favorite around. The scope of the menu and the options for those with dietary restrictions is awesome! It's a pizza place where you can opt to eat in a somewhat healthy manner! (Or be as cheesy, meaty, carby naughty as you desire!) Two of us went in on a Tuesday night, relatively late for Phoenix dinner (I think we met around 8ish). The place was packed - and we were lucky to get a table in the bar with no wait. There's a drink special each day - Tuesday was cheap premium beer. The service was friendly and on point, food was delivered quickly - fresh and hot for the pizza, fresh and cold for the salad. The visit was definitely worthy of a four star review - and I know lots of people swear by the pizza - but it just wasn't stellar for me. Good, but not amazing. However - based on the comfort and cleanliness of the place, friendliness and competency of all the staff I encountered and overall quality and volume of options - I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in Phoenix. Great for delivery too. From boneless wings to pizza it's all great. Have not had a bad experience with over 10 visits"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had anywhere in Phoenix. Tried the thin crust, thick crust, and gluten-free crust and all were delicious, especially the gluten-free. Gluten-free crust normally has a weird taste and texture, but here I couldn't even tell it was gluten-free! Sauce is amazing. Great topping selection. Will definitely be eating here anytime I want pizza! One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Pizza and garlic bread.  They gave me the pizza and sause for the bread but no bread.  The sad thing was the cashier did a double take to make sure everything was there but forgot something important.  I take part of the blame since I should have looked it over.  My advise if you do take out is to open everything"}
{"text":"So this location is getting 5 starts from me for sure! I've been to the location on 7th street and Bethany. It may be fancier but this little location's food is much better! I like both but if you want the best meal... Go to this location! We got the Super 6 Sicilian style, small. (Happy hour 8 dollars. Everyday Happy Hour with great selections 2-6) and the Antipasto Salad. The salad was so crisp and fresh with tons of great, and quality  toppings. The pizza was hot, fresh, soooo crispy (even Sicilian style!) the toppings had tons of flavor and color. It was the best pizza I've had in years! I did not find that to be so at the 7th St. Location. And as usual...  Excited to come back sit on their patio when it cools down. It looks so cute! Interior is very cute as well, super small though. That's why Happy Hour was perfect for us. Avoided the rush and extra $$. All in all, I'm super happy I decided to give this location a try! We will be back soon! New favorite pizza!! (Sorry Pizzeria Bianco :( )"}
{"text":"The service here was good. Unfortunately, the food here, like other Spinato's locations I've been to over the years, was bland, bland, bland. In the area, the location was convenient for the time that we had to give. On this trip we tried a Sicilian pepperoni pizza (excessively oily) and a MaMa's signature calzone (wet and runny, not moist). While there are worse places to eat, there are certainly better."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Their sausage and mushroom and the spinach and tomato were amazing! I don't know how they make their sauce it's different but definitely very tasty, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Italian lottery...homemade sauce is a nice finishing touch on any entree"}
{"text":"Avoid online ordering. I love this place, however the online ordering is not quite there. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, they sent a half cheese half pep. I called to express my concern, mentioned I had an email receipt, they did nothing. I'm happy to pay for half the pizza, but wish they would have credited half back to my card since it was their error. Have screen shots and emails if anyone sees this and would like to fix the site."}
{"text":"A great stop for pizza and a few beers.  Pizzas were the big six & chicken presto pesto, two great choices. Beer was San Tan IPA's Sat at the bar, no waiting, bartender was great."}
{"text":"We still love our Spinatos....enjoy greeted by name and pizza is still outstanding as we love thin crust. The 3/4 baked option is awesome if you like to take pizza home and enjoy it fresher than just reheating an already fully cooked pizza. Mistakes happen and Spinatos ALWAYS makes it right...."}
{"text":"It's amazing! The spaghetti is the best I have had and the pizza is bomb too. This is a great spot for date night or take out."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving three stars is because we cannot sit outside. This is my first review here. I've been here many times. Conan is a great guy. Tonight our server, her name is Kieko, great server!Food is amazing but I want to sit outside. 5 stars for the food.   one star because we can't sit outside."}
{"text":"Top 3 pizza place in Phoenix. Thin crust, perfect cheese, sweet sauce so you're gonna need sausage and pepperoni.. This is the pizza all others are compared to."}
{"text":"In general, I think Spinatos is the best pizza in the world.  Specifically, however, the Spinnys on FLW is the worst of the lot. I've never had a \"spectacular \" pizza from this location.  I wrote the manager, and he simply ignored me. The pizza was limp, soggy and ..meh... Spinnys at 16th st and Bell iis a loooong hike from here...on special occasions I'll make the hike.  Otherwise, I see no reason to pay for premium pizza and get mediocrizza"}
{"text":"Great service & tasty food, but canned mushrooms is a deal breaker.  It tells me other ingredients may also be not fresh."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on the fact that my husband has had it and enjoyed it. We ordered bone in wings half hot the other half honey hot. The wings were ok size the hot were hot and I liked both flavors. Also ordered a medium meat lovers which gave us plenty of leftovers. The sauce was so sweet I did not enjoy the pizza, but I got through it. Plenty of leftovers for my husband to eat. My daughter had the kids pizza and ate it all and enjoyed it. I also ordered a summer drink that had Malibu and the first one was really good. Order another one and it was so strong my husband even agreed and had to finish it for me. So for me two stars for the wings and my family enjoying the food. Service was slow but the young lady was nice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Arizona!  I wish they would take over AZ by building more restaurants. We need one in Anthem, Avondale, Casa Grande, Peoria, etc. If you are in the area-must stop by and get a pizza from here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always looking for a new pizzeria restaurant with a difference. Make my own pizzas for years and always highly complimented from friends and guests back in NEW YORK/NEW JERSY. First visit around 4 pm chandler Blvd. Very Clean nicely decorated, friendly welcome and goodbye, booth comfortable seats cushy, TV, prompt service. Ordered for my wife and I. Ordered 2 speciality pizzas. We shared boneless chicken wings in a semi hot red sauce excellent. Shared a Mediterranean Greek salad very good ( not as good as GRIMALDI'S which is perfect), but very enjoyable would order both again. We did combo meats pies with all the meats each pie different combinations with the red sauce. Would definitely come back. Thoroughly enjoyed the lunch experience and it's just not the pizza. You can order off a varied menu. Took home about a whole pie half of one half of the other. Reheated a few days for lunch in a cuisinart pro convection oven 400 degrees about 5 minutes, very thin pizza, needs to be watched. Well it was even better reheated. SO NOW WE HAVE 2 different style pizza restaurants to eat in and always looking for another. Took 3 years to find 2."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.  We got pizza to go last night and found ourselves pleasantly surprised. We ordered a large thin crust with plain cheese and a large thin crust with onions and meatball. The two pizzas were over $40 but as a special treat they were worth it. We ordered just after 5 on a Friday night and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. The restaurant was packed when we got there and they were ready as they said they would be.  Their sauce has a hint of sweetness that I really enjoyed and they don't skimp on the toppings. The crust is soft and perfectly chewy. I realize that's not everyone favorite but that's how I like it."}
{"text":"It is all about the sauce! I had the Mamma Spinato's pizza and added Italian sausage and it was really good. The sausage gave me texture but not so much flavor, I really could have went without it. Everything else was fresh, and pizza was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to go back and try something else. It's not five stars because price is a factor, it was kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in all of Arizona. Locations in Ahwatukee, Tempe, N. Scottsdale and North and Central Phoenix you have NO EXUSE not to go. My only complaint about Spinato's is I eat way, way too much every time I go. God Bless the Spinato family!"}
{"text":"I love there pizza, pasta, and calzones. So does my bf. I only do pick up there I don't care to dine in much."}
{"text":"Went to go buy a car on Saturday and found this little hole in the wall what a great pizza place. Best pizza place I've found in the valley so far highly would recommend everyone going sometime at least this location the atmosphere is awesome they treat you as if you are family."}
{"text":"You got to check out Spinato's on 7th street & Missouri. Delicious food and great environment. Centrally located in the heart of Phoenix. We enjoyed so much!!! Our server Pedro rocked :)   Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"The four of us came here for lunch and had a great time.  Spinato's has a nice ambiance as you enter and you will notice a great many Chicago posters, such as Illinois Central, Chicago Worlds Fair and B&W photos of the bridges crossing the Chicago River. Nice!  The food is equally good. The four of us each ordered different pizzas but really enjoyed the flavor.  This not your classic Chicago deep dish place, so you might be surprised by the thin crust cut into squares.  We really enjoyed it, and reminded us of the Edwardo's chain.  http://www.edwardos.com/  The pizza also has that sweet tomato sauce they served in St. Louis.  My friend Marvin A. is right, \"it's over the top\" sweet.  And it will surprise you when you first try it, but it works well.  In St Louis, they use Provel cheese which has a more buttery and creamy taste.  But here the manager Tim assures me they use mozzarella.  Still, it was very good.    We enjoyed Spinato's and will be back.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here on many occasions (new location and old) and its consistent: pizza is really good, hostesses are terrible.  Hit or miss as far as the servers - seems like super high turnover since they are always different.  But we come back for the pizza."}
{"text":"I went to a pizza place for a sandwich and I am glad I did.  A coworker and I stopped by here today for a quick lunch and since we were in a rush we ordered sandwiches thinking it would be faster than pizza. It wasn't but that's ok. I had the turkey pesto sandwich on toasted bread with roasted peppers, greens and cheese. It was delicious! It was loaded with meat and and tasty! My coworker had the meatball sandwich which he said was delicious. Both came with potato chips which were ok but seemed to be leaning towards the stale side. I will definitely come back here for pizza.  The location is bright and beautiful. Everything was clean and the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Best spinach pizza ever. We've always done take-out until this afternoon when two friends and I decided to sit in for lunch. Our server, Ian, was very friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. I ordered a penne pasta dish while my friends each ordered sandwiches. Prices are fair and the portions are generous and we each walked out with to-go boxes. I'm so happy I've recently moved to Ahwatukee so I can be a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent... I will order carry out next time. My girlfriends and I arrived at 9:05 got sat right away, and greeted by our server right away. We got our drinks  and at about 915 we asked for 5-10 more minutes to decided. Our server never came back for about 20 mins. We had to go up to the host so he could get our server, she comes back puts our order in at about 940 or so.. they closed at 10. Well we didn't get our food until 10, because it took so long for our server to take our order, so we ate quickly (being servers we know how it is to have a table pass closing) 1015 she brings us boxes and says \"you guys aren't planning on staying for dessert right? the kitchen would be really upset\" then waits staring at us as we are trying to figure out our tab. ( we were not the only table left, there were at least 3-4 others still dinning in. Safe to say it was very uncomfortable the whole dinner, as we felt rushed and unwelcome. We left around 1020.. only 20 mins after close."}
{"text":"We just moved to 32nd street and deer valley. When we found out Spinato's delivered, it was as if we won the lottery!!  We love this place. Sweet Sauce Pizza, Fresh Ingredients, nice people on the phone and very nice delivery drivers.  This place Rocks!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem near FLW's Taliesin. Enjoyed house specialty spinach, thin-crust pizza!"}
{"text":"We moved to Scottsdale about a year ago, and this has gone from a place that we went to once in awhile, to now almost every Friday.  We love it and it's our favorite pizza place in the area.  Their pizzas are great, and their calzones are the best that I've ever had (the Baked Spaghetti Calzone is tremendous).  We usually get takeout, but it's even better if you stay there and have it fresh.  Also, just a tip...if you order takeout, the pizzas are always ready before they say they will be.  Usually they'll tell us they'll be ready in 35 minutes or so.  We usually get there in 20, and they're just coming out, or they're ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"AhMAZING pizza and sandwiches. Even if you are gluten free with Celiac. No cross contamination here!  Very savory in flavor with good cheese and excellent seasonings.  Have also ordered their to go pizza and they are excellent.   Well worth your visit."}
{"text":"The pizza was AMAZING! It is the kind of pizza that makes you rush home after your meal so that you can tear in to your left overs. The service was amazing as well. Maria was so friendly! This place feels like an old school pizzaria should. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"OMG- their spaghetti and meatball calzone is freakin amazing! I don't know what my obsession with meatballs means, but this thing was incredible! We got a medium and split it and wished there was more after it was gone. Well done!"}
{"text":"One of our family's favorite places! Consistently great service, recent functional expansion to get carry-out orders out of the way of dine-in guests. Bartender (i think Vicki) is fantastic, kiltlifter on tap, Wednesdays 1/2 priced wine bottles, good portions on salads, great pizza options and attentive staff. Despite the various locations in the phoenix valley, we could really use one further west =)"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place opened up within walking distance. The pizza is tasty and reasonably priced. Decor is great and service friendly and professional. It's a place we take out of towners when they feel like pizza."}
{"text":"Called in an pick-up order for a Sicilian cheese pie with extra cheese at 5:05 PM, and was told it would be ready by 5:50 PM. Arrived at 5:50 and was told it'll be another 10 minutes (6:00). At 6:10, was told 'It's in the oven - ready in 3 minutes. At 6:20 (1/2 hour after the original time), STILL not ready. FINALLY, after telling them they have 2 minutes to bring me my order or forget it, it came. BUT, it certainly didn't have extra cheese! LAST TIME I'll ever order from them!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner! Spinatos never disappoints. We've been coming here for 8 years now and still love it as much as the first time. Had the Mama's Signature pizza. Best sauce you'll ever have. Can't wait until our next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the stuffed mushrooms and meatball sandwich. I'm from Chicago and this is by far the best food in Arizona I've tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual.  Too bad they changed their happy hour, less choices and a grumpy bartender.  Ooh well, it's still very tasty."}
{"text":"Husband and I just had a thin crust 1/2 cheese & pepperoni and it was delish!!  The sauce is seriously amazing and the crust is like no other!  My husband who is from Wisconsin, said it reminded him of pizza he had there growing up.  So glad we found this place, we will be back and can't wait to have your pizza again!"}
{"text":"Good pizza sometimes. Horrible service every single time.   Note to the family that owns this business: Focus more on your core competency and less on selling sauces and gluten free stuff. You can't get a pizza out the door, on time and not burned. The guy that tried to pass off that latest burned pizza should be fired. Plus before I made you make another one you were ALREADY 20 minutes late on the burned one (maybe if you were on time I wouldn't have been burned!!!!!) At 5:00 on a Monday with an empty restaurant no less!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Spinato's this has become a regular date night location. We always come back for \"Da Greek\" thin crust pizza. It's always packed with all those yummy veggies and flavor! Always great and prompt service! Last time a big group ordered all of the ding dongs, so I HAVE to go back hahaha."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's! This is the only place in the valley I go to for pizza. I have visited all of the locations, and they are all consistently good. The quality of the food and service is always superb. I met the manager Mario at this location and he always takes time to speak with customers and you can tell that he genuinely cares about your experience. I always order \"Da Greek\" pizza which is super flavorful and is always packed with veggies. For dessert, I splurge and get the red velvet \"Ding Dong\". So delicious. You really get what you pay for here. Fresh and tasty pizza...keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!  The Mama's Special is insane.  They also have the most incredible meatball trio appetizer (get it with the vodka sauce).  Always fresh, hot and served with a smile.  Just keep in mind everything is cooked to order so it is not fast food."}
{"text":"We have come here several times, and we think it's wonderful.  They have very good pizza and a great meatball sandwich.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Having visited this restaurant many times when they were located on Glendale Road, I was glad to see them open their newly remodeled location. It is so much bigger, spacier, and upgraded. It did lose a little bit of that personal feel but the same great taste is there. Many of the crew from the old location came over and they are just as nice and friendly as before. One of my favorite things about this place is the sauce. I can't begin to describe it and you just have to taste it for yourself but it really brings something to their dishes.  This is apparent because they do sell it to go as well. There are many great pizzas to choose from here and all are delicious. One of my favorite things to try are their calzones that are stuffed with spaghetti and meatball and you will not be hungry the rest of the day!!  A must eat local pizzeria!  They have several locations in town and all are great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go to this location as well as the one on 7th street. No matter the location or time I go, I get amazing, friendly service. It feels more like eating with family at home then going out to eat. My favorite is their spinach pizza, but every dish I have had bursts with flavor. If you get a chance to go make sure to save room for dessert because holy cannoli!"}
{"text":"Great place with great staff. I had the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich and it was amazing, balanced flavors. They offer beer from our local brewery's and i had peach Ale. My server was Moe, very friendly and professional which made my experience even better. Definitely recommend this place especially we lack some good food around the area."}
{"text":"Gone here a hundred times, dine-in & carry-out. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the pizza, the service is good and best of all, it's family-owned and NOT A CHAIN!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, we loved it. When it comes to this sort of restaurant, I am a tough critic. Maybe because this is what I do!    Anywho, we just loved it! Nice setting, we sat outside in the sun, and if it had been cloudy our server would have put a shine on us. So nice, sincere and helpful. How do they find someone like this for such a casual eatery!    We had the mini calzone filled with pasta, odd, but tasty. We had two pizzas and the cheese sauce and toppings were loved. The crust, well, it's Chicago thin crust style. Can't say I am fan but it was true to the style.    Oh and I ordered the local brew, Scottish style named \"Kilt Lifter\", I mean really can you pass up a brew with a name like that! PS. Though we did not try they did also do Deep dish, they had the thin crust spot on for Chitown so I would guess the deep dish is a good Second City Copy!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings and pasta. Service is usually great too. Can be busy, but it's worth the wait. Love this new location."}
{"text":"Ive worked at two pizza joints in the valley and this is THE best pizza Ive ever had. I am in love with the sauce. Its slightly sweet and delicious. The Spinach and Garlic pizza is moving up on my list of last meal before I die."}
{"text":"Yum! I really love this pizza. I'm from Chicago, so I like to consider myself something of a pizza snob. Granted, it doesn't quite measure up to the real Chicago pizza, but it comes pretty close. I love that they have Italian beef as a topping! Seriously, so good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Out of all the Spinato's this one has the best pizza and Bloody Mary's. My all time favorite pizza place.  I am never disappointed.  Unfortunately, I never leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"From midwest have had such a hard time finding a pizza we liked. One order and we felt like home."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week.  The pizza isspectacular.  Mamas recipe is the most delicious pizza outside of NYC.  Their entrees are great too, weve ordered many of their pasta dishes and we are never disappointed.  Keep in mind if you are going to order delivery like we do they are very busy on the weekends so order early."}
{"text":"Always great pizza and fast service. This company makes a unique sweet pizza sauce that all of my customers I fed for lunch today really liked. The pizzas are nice sized for the price, and vegetables and meat are spread generously. My take out order was on time and Kimberly greeted me with a smile. I was told by the owner months before that the pizza sauce recipe has been passed down for generations. We'll Done!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food and service was over the top. Sampled several pizzas,  each of which was the best thin crust pizzas I have had since living in Arizona.  The Margarita was a favorite with the addition of Italian sausage.  Kids had Gelato and the rest of us passed on desert. As soon as our server, Bobby heard that it was our first visit he brought out a Cannoli for the rest to share. Even wrote \"First Timers\" in chocolate on the plate. This is service. Too bad we live 120 miles away, this would be a frequent stop for us."}
{"text":"Wings weren't as good as I remember them, but I do remember them, so i'll be back. Love the calzones and pizza!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and great service. I stopped in pretty late starving because I meant to eat earlier. Not only did they still seat me but I had my meal in no time. I ordered a small side Caesar salad and a personal sized pizza. Some of the best pizza I've had in a long time. The servers were friendly and fast. A pleasant experience for a late evening stop."}
{"text":"Great pizza especially for thin crust. Ordered the Chicken Presto Pesto-yum, yum, yum. Slices aren't cut like traditional triangles, but that's fine for me. Crust was thin & crunchy. Great Happy Hour specials-a must return to try."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and tried something different today. The Italian sausage sandwich is great in case you want to venture outside of their pizzas. I'm glad this is in my hood"}
{"text":"This location is by far the best pizza in North Phoenix. If they sold wings they'd make my life complete. As is, it still deserves five stars."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It's very rare I find a pizza place I would be willing to say had delicious pizza.   We had the \"Nicole's new favorite\" which was delicious.  It was super hot, just out  of the oven. The crust was perfect!  Even my Italian husband liked it.   The service was excellent also! I was a server for 10 years so I am a service snob. Our server, Jason, was awesome!  Quick, funny and very understanding when my husband accidentally spilled his beer. He even replaced it! Which I have never experienced anywhere.  We loved being able to watch the football game on the TV'S in the bar area!  We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Spinato's for the first time with some friends from work who had all been there before and swore by their pizza.  Decided to give it a go and see what all the fuss was about their pizza.  First off the new building they are in is really really nice.  nice and open with skylights galore giving a nice day time feel inside and extremely open.  We ended up splitting a large peperoni and sausage thin crust with a side Cesar.  The pizza came out and it looked awesome.  slightly greasy but being a professional fat guy I tend to get over something like that quite easily.  Their sauce has a great sweet quality about it and the thin crust wasn't too thin but there wasn't a lot of crunch to it which i'm ok with.  I know some thin crust purists would frown upon this but I don't care about them, this is my review!  all in all it was some damn fine pizza and I will for sure be back to here and try out a few other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The WORST service I have ever experience!!  I went here about a month ago and it took me and my friend over 20 minutes to get something to drink from the waiter.  Plus, while we were waiting for our orders to be filled, the waiter was helping other customers who got here AFTER us.  I have a feeling that the waiter was profiling us, maybe thinking that my friend and I were a couple (hes a guy, not a couple at all, but still no excuse).  Extremely disappointed, do not go here."}
{"text":"The pizza here, phenomenal! They have a sweeter marinara sauce, it's to die for. Their appetizer 3 meatballs in vodka cream sauce, ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time, and it was great! Service is always good. If it's busy, which it always is, food can take a little while to come out, but it's worth it!! Oh and you get a free canoli on your birthday :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Amazing food. Service is great. Vibe is classy yet fun. Management is present and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restraunt is a small little quaint pizzaria we waited abt 20 to 25 mins to get seated the service was great service Nick was our waiter and the manager was also great he was very friendly and helpful. Then to top it off we got the great six with hot peppers and garlic bread and a strawberry gorganzola salad . The pizza was by far the best pizza that I have ever had. It is a place I will be back to for sure."}
{"text":"After a ASU beat my Dad's once USC at home in the worst stadium ever, mind you..  My very happy ASU friends ordered up a Chicago style pizza from Spinatos.. THIS pizza rocks the valley; enuf said. It has a perfect crust texture.. and just the right amount of toppings & every week since then, I just crave it. Too bad I don't live closer. Oh well. That in itself probably keeps me thin! When I am with my friends out in N Phoenix watching games, this is the go-to pizza place!  Get your sauce for the side... and yum!"}
{"text":"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Again, this place has changed. Unhappy with the taste, texture and content. We complained to the mgr, Dave, when we were in there a month ago and he said no changes. Today we picked one up. Soggy and tasteless. Something has changed so we're done.  Dave"}
{"text":"Judging on pizza alone... I see no difference between this place and Domino's thin crust."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I could possibly say about this Spinato's is that it's just too far from my office. Any time I want to eat there for lunch, I have to get take out and come eat it at my desk. And let me tell you, driving back and smelling that pizza in the passenger seat next to me is pure torture. But maybe that's all a good thing... at least it keeps me from going there every day.  Apart from having the best pizza I've ever had the chance to nom on (and I've had quite a lot of pizza in my time,) the staff here is simply fantastic. They treat everybody like a friend or member of the family. All smiles, super pleasant, eager to do whatever they can to make sure that you are having a wonderful day. It's not even out of the ordinary to see the GM walking around, sweeping, making sure everybody is comfortable and being just ridiculously pleasant.  I really do love this place. That's all there is to it."}
{"text":"This is one place I would never be back to. All I will say is they need to keep a better eye on the bathroom upkeep. I also did not appreciate my server. Unable to recommend the one thing this restaurant is known for. You'd think is pizza but I have come to find out is their hero sandwiches. I also didn't get my ranch timely. The pizza was almost gone by then. My tip to you is don't let them sit you on one of the booths. Tell them you want the bar. They sit you faster & is actually much more comfortable and cool area. It looked remodeled. But even after that I would not be back... Nope."}
{"text":"A little bit out of the way, but this is definitely worth it. Their personal pizzas are available with thin or thick crust, but both are excellent, and priced right, starting at around 5 bucks. I'd go with the Spicy Italian, or maybe the Get Meaty, with 4 different meats.  For dessert, both the good old cannoli and the apple serenata with vanilla bean gelato are very good ways to end a great meal.  Service is always fast and friendly, and the place just seems very inviting.  The hours are a little weird, so check that out before going - it's caught me off guard more than once."}
{"text":"Hot , fresh AMAZING FLAVOR pizza! Simply delicious sauce ! On time delivery and very friendly service ! They serve One coconut water which is a great alternative to the normal sodas most places only offer. We had a medium extra cheese and Italian sausage! PERFECT! Can't wait to splurge on these carbs again! WORTH it!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!! It's so yummy and it's different type of Italian. It's one of my husbands and my favorite date spots! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I arrived pretty early on a Friday evening and it wasn't too crowded. I got seated right away.  I ordered a salad, some meatballs and a glass of wine on the happy hour menu. The salad was huge (enough leftovers for the next day) and the 3 meatballs were delicious!  My waitress was very helpful and made sure my experience was perfect."}
{"text":"So very disappointed with Spinatos pizzeria. It used to be one of my favorite spots until tonight. We had a large group of 12 with us and right off the back they didn't take reservations. The lady on the phone suggested that we get there 30 minutes prior to our scheduled meet up time to get a table for dinner. As soon as we got to the restaurant I spoke to the three hostesses who had to be at least 16 years old and talking about personal topics at the hostess stand, said that it would be and hour and forty five minutes wait.  I have never heard of such a long wait time. As we waited there, there were other people coming in after us with two groups of six, two groups of five and a group of four and all got seated right away. After about an hour wait and several annoying chats with the hostess, we asked to speak to a manager. The manager \"Ransom\" came to speak to us and we told him our issue. As soon as he responded, he clearly had a little attitude about how we felt. As soon as we called him out about the attitude he quickly denied it. He then told us he would work on getting us seated. It only took a few minutes for him to get us seats. I don't think the young hostess were properly trained. Walking through the dining room I noticed multiple tables available for seating, yet we were stuck outside standing and waiting for over and hour.   We sat down and right away got our drinks ordered. As soon as we got our drinks, we didn't see our waiter for several minutes. We noticed he was busy dealing with issues with other upset customers. One of our people had to wave down another waiter to take our order. With out hesitation Donna was kind enough to take on our group and get our orders in.  After serval attempts to get refills on our drinks. A friend had to get up and go to the bar and re fill a drink. After another long wait we finally got our food and all enjoyed the great pizza and calzones.  There were a few issues with the bills and all the split checks were wrong so Donna had to fix the checks several times which took even longer.   I have never been so happy to leave a place. Good food but horrible, unprofessional service and long wait times. We got there at 6:30pm didn't get seated till 8:00pm, didn't get food till after 9:30 pm and finally left around 10:15pm. Almost four hours of my life wasted.   Thank you to Donna for stepping up and taking care of us the best you could. Sadly I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Great drink specials.  Spinato's uses local olive oil from Queen Creek for one of their pizzas.  Makes it extra special.  Good for families.  Good for friends."}
{"text":"Great service !! Great pizza thin crest !!  Love it ! They have happy hour everyday 2-6 !!!"}
{"text":"Another go to pizzeria in mid town Phoenix, Az. This spot has a huge bar and great selection of authentic Italian food. Great take out service additionally."}
{"text":"I am updating my review after a few more visits. My first review only gave two stars because of horrible service I received at the bar. In the times I've returned since then, service in the restaurant has been better and the food is good. It is over-the-top amazing, but it's consistently good. Which goes along way in my book."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner the other night and were lucky enough to show up during happy hour.  We shared the $3 trio of meatballs and a $8 small specialty pizza...what a deal!  The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was great and the bar area was huge with plenty of TV's to watch the games.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thin crust Chicago Italian style pizza.  Italian beef sandwiches, Italian subs, antipasto salads.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  Who doesn't love a spaghetti calzone? Carb overload that will put you in a delightful carb coma!  The service is a little hit or miss, but overall a wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"My motto is keep your money in town!  So we met at Spinato's just to see what we could see.  I had (exact quantity redacted) glasses of the WildChild Red which comes from the Pillsbury Wine Company up in Jerome.  I want to driveup there to stock up!  GOOD RECOMMENDATION from our waiter Capn Jack Sparrow, thanks!  Caprese Skewers, Bruschetta & Meatball Trio were all hot, fresh & super tasty.  So was the Thin Crust pizza.  Fresh and flavorful.  Cut in Reasonable serving sizes - thanks!  Good Food - Good Service - Good Ambiance.  We thought the prices were great! No pressure to flip our table or keep our noise level down!"}
{"text":"Food was good but customer service was awful...won't be back....ever.  That's the mark of a good restaurant."}
{"text":"The ingredients were great, but tonight's experience was very average. I don't think the Sicilian crust is for me - it almost seemed stale. The sauce had great flavor, but it was too rich and overpowering. The breadsticks were awful - stale, not warm. I would try this place again because again, the flavors were good, but the texture was not."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the best pizza in the Phoenix area! I got the Mama Spinatos personal pizza. It was divine!   My husband ordered the Get Meaty and the smell alone had me wishing that he'd trade a slice with me.  My daughter ordered the kids cheese pizza and she loved it. Then they asked her what type of gelato she'd like and I thought her grin was going to take over her entire head. This wasn't just regular chocolate gelato, no it had a ribbon of the finest dark chocolate. It's the first time in my life that I've been jealous of a kid's meal!  We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Nicole's New Favorite pizza on thin crust is an amazing selection. The restaurant can get a little packed on the weekends with longer than expected waits.  I would also suggest the spaghetti and meatball calzone and almost any sandwich. You really cannot go wrong at Spinatos."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but this visit disappointed. Seemed like plenty of staff for Mother's Day but table turnover was slow. Over an our wait for our party of six was over an hour. Two of our family were in their 90's ans when we finally got a table we got beverages and order taken then never saw a waitress until our order came 30 minutes later! I finally went to the kitchen and asked  for bread.  We were in the restaurant over 2 1/2 hours. For a fine dining experience that's one thing but this is a family pizzeria. Open every table! Patio tables were closed and no one was being seated in the banquet room. This was our third visit of the week and the worst. Poor service far outweighed the goos food."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here. The pizzas are so good. The pasta tastes fresh and flavorful. We had chicken pesto pizza, spicy italian pizza and cheese ravioli. And all were beyond expectation. The staff was super friendly and genuine, they treated us like we are their family. Great service, great food, will be coming back here for many more times. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have had better. I think the menu is nice, the service was fine, but its pizza and for us to have a $100+ bill for five and two kids seems $$$ overpriced for pizza!"}
{"text":"Notes from Spinato's:  Meatball Trio - Even though the name of this appetizer suggests three different types of meatballs...it's just three meatballs. Nevertheless, get this! So good! We got the sauce on the side so we could try both options. Both sauces were good, but we liked the marinara the best.  Greek Salad - Wow, amazing! The dressing on this salad can't be beat...not even at a Greek restaurant.  Pizza - Meh. The crust wasn't bad (we got the thin), and the cheese was amazing, but the sauce was WAY too sweet. Tasted like ketchup (yuck!). Still, as bad as the sauce was, the crust and cheese made it edible. I think next time I'll try the Margherita Pizza and get a side of Marinara to dip the crust in.  Classic Submarine Sandwich - Pretty good. The insides were delicious, but the bread really took away from the flavor. The bread was a dry, flavorless, airy sub sandwich roll, not a fresh-baked baguette. Unfortunate too, because between the lifeless bread and the too-sweet pizza sauce, they lost a full star on what could have been a 5-star rating.  Overall, I really enjoyed Spinatos. The staff was great. The atmosphere was very nice. The food was mostly delicious. I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  New, great service, and excellent pizza!  I've been here many times and have yet to be let down.  Plus, it's close to where I live.  So kind of like me and this pizza place were meant to be!"}
{"text":"WOW!!  We couldn't decide where to have lunch so we based it on Yelp reviews and I'm happy to report, everyone was right!   We shared the greek salad and a pizza. First off a medium was too large for the two of us, especially getting it as a deep dish.   We will definitely be back ASAP!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the combo Chi style pizza. OMG! Yummy, yummy, yummy. I ate until I was full and then ate some more. I'm a definite fan. The sauce is a little sweet, but it works. I'm looking forward to trying the location in Scottsdale. I'm thinking about trying  a calzone."}
{"text":"Why mess up a good thing? I asked for extra tomato sauce and was grossed out when I discovered that they squeezed extra sauce all over the top of the pizza. For some reason this pizza tasted disgustingly sweet. This was my Spinato's pizza."}
{"text":"Shout out to the guy on Trip Advisor who said the L'Italiana here is the best pizza in Northern Phoenix...I don't live locally, but this was wonderful advice and was well worth going a few miles out of the way for.  Antipasto salad was good, if not standard.  But man, that pizza.  Really incredible."}
{"text":"This is the best thin crust Chicago pizza. The waitress however was busy at her boyfriends booth rubbing his ear. We had to ask another server for our drinks when the appetizer came and no drinks. She made it right. But that waitress went right back to the boyfriend to kiss him goodbye. Pizza perfect  the rest of the staff made up for her."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight, had a slight issue but the manager took care of it very well! Pizza and apps were great, we had the meatball trio with vodka cream, the artichoke crostini, and the meaty pizza. All were amazing! Loved the food and the service, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town! I am craving the pizza and its just been a few days! I got the thin crust \"Other Signature\" personal pizza and my husband got a create your own deep dish with mushrooms, onions, and pineapple and we were both very satisfied. The ranch dressing is AMAZING!   The waitress was super friendly and attentive.   I would recommend Spinatos Pizza to EVERYONE and I can't wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza maker in Phoenix. I eat at or take out at the Chandler or Tempe locations. My favorite is the Super Six. The Chandler location is larger with a bar than the Tempe warehouse location. Both make superior pizza. :)"}
{"text":"The food and service here are excellent. There is something truly magical about their marinara sauce!! Honestly, everything I've tried so far on the menu is wonderful."}
{"text":"So so so delicious!  The happy hour menu makes me happy!  Crustini is very good!  Server was fun and flexible as party grew and shrank during meal."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu makes me happy!  Crustini is so tasty.  The bartenders are personable and make quality drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down our FAVORITE pizza place. We love pizza but nothing compares to Spinato's in my opinion and go at least once a week. If you are a pizza lover try this place! Ps ask for Maria is the sweetest waitress!"}
{"text":"This is a very friendly little restaurant with excellent pizza.  We have become regulars on Wednesday nights because Wednesday's are half price wine day! (all bottles of wine are 50% off).  But beside the allure of half price wine the atmosphere is nice and the staff seems like a family that cares about the business.  Pizza is fantastic and they offer lots of different toppings.  My favorite when I am in a meat mood is sausage and fresh garlic.  My wife and I ordered individual sized pizzas for the first time yesterday so we could each get our own toppings.  Combined with their giant salads the lil' pizza as they call it was very filling.    Spinato's also offers to go and delivery service."}
{"text":"Retched pizza. Tastes like it was in the refrigerator or a week, microwaved and delivered to my home. \"Garden Salads\" were nothing but spinach and the garlic bread certainly isn't worth 6.19. For $52 I would have expected something edible. Shame on you Spinato's."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix. Any drive or wait is well worth it when you're craving a seriously delicious pizza. The tase remains the same at the other valley locations as I've always been impressed no matter which one I go to. I've never even gotten to anything else on their menu because this pizza is top shelf and I never miss a chance to devour some. The staff are friendly and I've never got bad service at this location whether eating in or taking out. After tasting their pizza, I've never been able to eat a chain pizza again. Thanks for the great pizza and great service."}
{"text":"Delicious Midwest pizza. If you're familiar with Aurelio's Pizza then you already know what Spinato's tastes like because it's practically identical. The sweet sauce is so delicious and toppings are high quality. This is truly one of the best pies in the valley. And I'm from Chicago and consider myself hard to please when it comes to delicious pizza. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Spinato's in Tempe and am SOOO glad there is one closer to me now.  I LOVE how they re-did the old Chilis interior with white tiles and brick on the ceiling. Very italian looking and cozy feeling.  They have a fantastic selection of food and the best pizza I have ever had. I'm pretty sure they add crack to their pizza sauce since it is highly addictive and sweet. We have sat in both the bar and restaurant and had the same courteous and quick wait staff attention in both areas.  My favorite item is the appetizer spaghetti baked calzone with ricotta and meatballs.  This is just big enough you can eat it as a meal yourself.  The salads are large in size and the dressings taste fresh. My favorite pizza is hard to say but the \"Get Meaty\" and \"Spicy Italian\" are both heaven in a thin crust. Check please and a wheel barrow! Oh and they have a nice selection of beers on tap.  I'm such a fan, I'm probably here at least once every other week."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's and so does my family! We love having get-togethers here. There is something for everyone: great salads and wine for my mom, savory pizzas for the guys and even the best GF pizza I have ever tried, for me. Their toppings are fresh and their service is always friendly. I love getting it to-go as well. All-around great place. Some say the sauce is too sweet but I think it's delicious! Can't beat their thin crust!!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype pizza wise. We ordered 2 and scarfed both of them down. They need to open one up in Gilbert!!!  I'd be there every night if there was one closer......OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Every pizza and pasta we have had is amazing.   The sweet sauce on the pizza is like nothing we have ever had.  Maria is one of the best waitress.  Spinatos is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I don't know what it is about this place but I just can't get enough. I think that the sauce they use on the pizzas is incredible and makes the pizza! The waitstaff are great and super nice. From the pizza to the calzones this place does it right!! Try everything because the sandwiches, pastas, salads, and everything else are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizza I've ever had. Fantastic salads and meatballs.  They have a quaint dining room but also have take out if you need it on the go. Great service with tremendous Italian food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I must admit I am addicted to this pizza. If I lived closer I would have more pizza in my life! Amazing sauce that makes you think about it and want more after you have left. I usually get the small peperoni, which is perfect for one person with enough to take home for later. I have had great service each time I have been here and come by when I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If Pizzeria is in your name you should do pizza really well, unfortunately Spinato's does not.  We walked in, friendly staff, newly remodeled dinning room, comfortable booths, and a large menu.  We opted for a Plain cheese pizza, and a small calzone with black olives, mushrooms and the \"optional\" ricotta.   The pizza, was sub par, the crust was like that of a frozen take home pizza, the sauce is sweet and that is the only flavor note no spices etc, the cheese was ok but overpowered by sweetness of the sauce. There are many better options.   The calzone, is really a Stromboli, I wonder why the ricotta is optinal as it would be empty without it. The sauce again was sweet, the ricota and cheese was lacking in volume and the crust was more of a pastry style. Again there are better options.  I can on and on why I don't like the food here but you get the point, the flavors and textures are not what I want from pizza.   Plus I like my pizza sliced not cut into squares."}
{"text":"i cannot say enough about Spinato's.  it is one of my favorite places to eat.  No food ever goes to waste!!  Love the sauce!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal pizza. This place has been right down the street from my home for years and I finally got around to trying it. I can't believe I waited so long. Spinato's pizza is very very good. I got delivery so I couldn't say anything about the dinning experience but their product is fantastic. After just one pizza (the Chicago), I can safely say Spinato's is now my go to pizza delivery joint in my neighborhood. I look forward to trying the dine-in experience as well."}
{"text":"If there was an option for negative stars, the Ahwatukee Spinatos would get it tonight. We ordered 3 pizzas for pick up and went to pick up, only 2 were made.   On the phone we had asked for tomato options on the 3rd pizza, so we were certain the order was placed.    After waiting nearly 5 minutes, spoke to athe FOH manager and he said he would gladly make the 3rd pizza and charge us for it leaving the others cold and soggy for 20 minutes while they made the 3rd pizza.   We decided to skip that option and will never spend the money for this over-priced under served pizza again.  Hard cost on re-making 3 pizzas (while we waited for them) was probably less than $10.   Hope that was worth it.  MANAGER FAIL."}
{"text":"Spinatos in Ahwahtukee is not the place if you want spaghetti with sauce. The spaghetti was cold and looked like it came from a box and the italian meatballs, were oversized chef boyardee meatballs  i am Italian and this is definitely not authentic. Yes, they offered me a refund which was kind but i heard from a few people how great the food is. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Like most of the other reviewers the pizza sauce here to me is on the sweeter side, but I liked it. I noticed a lot of people order their pizza extra crispy; we didn't and the crust was crisp but it didn't crunch, if you like that - ask for it. The hubby and I shared a small pizza and a pitcher of beer plus a side salad. Our Bill was $30 plus tip and we were plenty full.  Wed night is half off bottles of wine too; not that big of a selection but getting a $30 bottle for $15 is a great deal. The staff was nice and very attentive to our party of 10. Nothing to complain about at all from our visit. Great job."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo.. said it was gonna be 30 min and gave them 40 min. Still here and now has been hour. Would of preferred of been told it will take an hour for pick up than show up and sit around doing nothing. Bad management. Good pizza."}
{"text":"I have been the biggest Spinato's fan since the once small pizza parlor had one location in the valley. It has been exciting to see them grow. I guess what I like the most is the service is always the same no matter which lcoation you dine at. Even the food it consistanct.   I recently dined with my family this past Mother's Day. The whole crew my family, friends and I came in to dine at one big table. We ordered a variety of all the fixings so we can all have the pleasure to sampele each other's favorite entree. The portion size of our pizza, garlic toast, cheese toast and salads were reasonable. I tried something different this time. I went with the Gluten Free Pizza. Boy was it yumm!. I did not feel like I was missing out on anything. Matter fact it was so good not one person at the table had an opportunity to sample mine. It was gone in no time.   Everything is made fresh at Spinato's. They have some of the tastiest freshhome made sauces. Be sure to check out the website. You can order food to go."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Super clean new restaurant. Amazing sauce. Fantastic meatballs. Superb pizza. I love Spinatos!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to Spinato's for the first time on a Saturday, and the restaurant, although fairly large, was packed. No surprise there, because the food was good, but there was a wait time. Nevertheless, our server took good care of us when we were seated.   I got the combo on gluten free crust, which was really delicious. The crust was similar to the GF crust sold at Sauce: chewy and slightly crunchy at the same time. It's been a while since I've had good pizza. While I never got to try the \"Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach\" pizza that the rest of my family members got, they expressed that the pizza was cooked to perfection - even my mom, who doesn't like cheese, ate a few slices. My mom got the pear & pecan salad, which she expressed was good with a slightly \"sour\" taste to it (the good kind of \"sour\").   The only downside of Spinato's was the wait time for the food - we didn't really mind waiting to be seated but we were very hungry by the time the food came around. It took about 40 minutes for two pizzas and a salad, and it was a challenge to entertain my sister's two hungry and tired toddlers during that time. Although they were given kids' menus with crayons, they showed little interest... because they were hungry. My mom commented that it may have been better to order ahead for a pickup and eat at home, especially in consideration of the children. If you're hungry, I recommend getting an appetizer to munch on while you wait.   Bottom line: great pizza, yummy salad, lots of GF options. Good service. Wait time is long, though, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"If I could give this poor excuse for a pizza place an absolute zero I would. The last three times I've ordered takeout--and I have arrived on time, by the way--the pizza has been cold. In addition, the staff couldn't care less and is completely inept. When I arrived today to pick up my pre-ordered pizza, I waited 45 minutes and again, it was cold. They offered another, but by that point, I wasn't about to waste more time waiting. I finally had enough today and asked for a refund. It was granted, but you can bet I won't be back and will tell all my friends to spend their money elsewhere. Even Domino's gives a crap about their customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast service, average spirits selection, amd friendly waiters.  This place would have gotten 5 stars, but they tried to give us another tables food, then a second waiter tried to take our order again.  It was explained that they remodeled last month.  However, the staff had a month to learn new table assignments and this waiters innability to learn the change should not be accepted from management."}
{"text":"Carry out side is very busy on Friday night, but they have the right people working. Best customer service that I have seen in a long time!"}
{"text":"Ordered a thin crust sausage, tomato, onion, and green pepper pizza based on all the great Yelp reviews. A group of us all tried it, although there was just something wrong with the taste. In the end we couldn't pin it, wasn't that good. Ended up tossing it. The breadsticks were much better, although nothing exciting to write home about. Can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service!  Been going here for years, and won't stop.  I am always surety take friends and family.  The pizza is great, but I suggest the baked spaghetti calzone"}
{"text":"Got here at 7:43. It is now 8:40 and I still have yet to get my food. It is pretty slow here. Got some garlic bread, and it came with good old-fashion canned tomato sauce. This place sucks. Just go to Times Square and get the Pasta Giovani. That place is great."}
{"text":"Exactly like Aurelio's Pizza in the Chicago area with the sweeter tomato sauce on the pizzas.  Great service and good food. Efficient takeout service. A littler pricier than I'd prefer, however when I'm craving it, I'll cough up the extra couple bucks for it :-)"}
{"text":"When visiting Phoenix, Spinatos is always our guilty pleasure!  They have a wonderful selection of fresh veggies and meats to build the perfect pizza.  One nice feature is, they remember your previous order, and if you forgot what delicious pizza you made on your last trip there, they didn't!  Our son thinks the pizza is even more delicious cold, the next morning.  Problem is, there is hardly ever any left over!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, love Spinato's.   All of the locations are friendly, delicious & clean. The pizza is one-of-a-kind and is definitely worth a visit if you haven't been! Try The Chicago pizza. It's my favorite. And save room for a cannoli!"}
{"text":"Best Greek salad, best Greek pizza, best spinach pizza!  YUM-O!"}
{"text":"I have been to Spinato's three times now. Twice for takeout, once we ate in the dining room. I have three thoughts: - The pizza is good.  - The pizza is overpriced. - The service is craptastic. The first time they made me the wrong pizza and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes after everyone else had received their food. No discount was given on my order. The third time I called an order in and they told me it would 30-35 minutes. My wait was actually 57 minutes. When I complained the takeout person just looked at me with a blank stare. No apology, no discount.  The service is so bad it is enough to send me elsewhere, like Grimaldi's, if I am going to spend that kind of money on pizza."}
{"text":"Love Love this Pizzeria! They offer the best food and service in town. I can't think of anything on the menu that I have not tried. The calzones are amazing and a great size. All the Pizzas hands down are delicious. The salads are so fresh and full of flavor. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Great for families and couples. The customer service is phenomenal. The team is Kind and always attentive. They greet you with a warm smile and always ready to help you with any questions. Thank you for having this great location.   Sorry ate all the food! I would post pics, but didn't make it."}
{"text":"MAMMA MIA!!! Delicioso.. Found this gem pizza place when I just travel and cruising down chandler blvd. It does looks like a high end pizza place from the front but OMG! the food experience is totally beyond my expectation. If you love pizza so much, you definitely should come here. They made the pizza and pasta from scratch and it cooks to perfection. You can smell the charcoal from the edge of your pizza. And the customer service is so impressive!. I went there for Mother's Day and the waiter gave us Italy Connoli (the crispy crust pastry filled with cream and chocolate drip) cause we waited for our food due to the very crowded restaurant!.. Whoever served me - waiter in pink shirt - you got me hooked to this place! I definitely come swing by here again.."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!  Husband and I had pizza, while Mom tried the Italian beef sandwich.  Everything was delicious.  Coming from Chicago, it was pretty impressive to find a spot-on Italian beef sandwich down here in the desert.  The pizza was the best I've had in a while.  We are new to the area, and will definitely be back again! :)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the food here. Nothing but impressed with the consistency of the their mamas famous pizza!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I can find in Phoenix. The ingredients are top notch. The service is excellent. It is not the cheapest pizza joint but well worth it."}
{"text":"My only experiences with this restaurant have been limited to delivery, so that has colored my perspective. It's important to point out that their ingredients are fresh and authentic. They add oregano to their pizzas (lots of flavor) and load on the cheese. HOWEVER, their crust is super, super thin. That means that if you order their pizza as takeout or have it delivered, the cheese grease will quickly turn the already soft dough into a soggy cold mess. The pizza is also less than desirable when it's reheated the next day (even when it's reheated in the oven it's unappetizing). I also hate how they cut up the pie; it's divided into tiny little squares. I enjoy a good pizza crust and I want each slice to have a piece of chewy crust attached to it. The lack of crust also makes gripping the pizza a beast. Their high prices also irritated me; they are soooo much more expensive than the competition. A tiny little sandwich cost $9 and a medium pizza with three ingredients was $18. I was also in a state of disbelief over their delivery fee ($4.95!? And you are still expected to tip on top of the fee!) and that they up-charged me on a simple substitution. I would not have the pizza delivered--pick it up or eat in! The only thing that was reasonably priced was their cannoli ($3.49) and it was excellent; very good quality. I personally will not be ordering from here again due to the high cost of the food and having it delivered. I think they do provide a quality product, but as other reviewers have pointed out, you could probably go someplace else in the neighborhood where the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"Spinato's is a locally owned family ran pizza/restaurant chain. You can do take out service or you can get seated in the cozy dining room or patio. This location gets very busy around happy hour time and might be on a wait during all of happy hour.  The people we with highly recommended getting the Spinach Calzone with added Ricotta Cheese. We ordered and it took a very long time for the Calzones to come out of the kitchen but once they arrived our server was very attentive and brought us sauce with the calzones.  If you are very critical with your tasting you will notice that the sauce is very sweet and also very salty. If you are a normal taster and taste the sauce on the calzone you will see it as wildly flavorful.  I liked that the calzones had a thin crisp dough. The calzones were also very heavy with garlic and stuffed with lots of melty cheese and lots of fresh baby spinach. Overall it was tasty and service was good.   Prices are low and the food is very filling.  You'll leave stuffed like a calzone.  3.5 stars rounded up because for Phoenix Standards I feel the food I tasted and atmosphere seemed above what the average neighborhood pizza joint offers."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait, get here before 5 or after 8:30 on the weekend.  By 5:10 they were waiting outside the door!  I have to agree with Nicole on the pepperoni, feta, mozzarella ...it's a perfect combo. Thin crispy crust is their standard and I can see why. Also tried the Combo and loved it on the thin crust, but  my favorite item on the menu is the trio of meatballs-YUM!  They have the meatball making down pat.  I could go in there and just have the meatballs and bread....if I absolutely had to. The meatballs come in  marinara with hot bubbly cheese melted and just browned."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down thee best pizza and meatballs we've had in AZ. From the ingredients to the crust! Totally Awesome! Happy hour from 3-6 you can't beat."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in town! Sister said, she loved her Pasta! We will be back! Super clean and courteous facility! The server told me how they made their pizza and that they used new utensils etc. To make sure it was a gluten free as possible! My house wine was good too."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sauce has a sweet taste and a little different from the norm. They have pretty good salads but let's face it. You come here for the carbs. Love their pizza and also the spaghetti with homemade meatballs. Such great service consistently. My husband and I love to come here and definitely do at least once a week. Also, the Apple serenata is life. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We ordered an appetizer, garlic cheese bread (so, so, wouldn't order again), Pear and Pecan salad (good mix, excellent), Chicken Pesto Pizza (very disappointed with the crust, ate 3 pieces and left the rest, my daughter ordered pasta with vodka cream sauce with shrimp, (order arrived with no shrimp and marinara sauce; when new order arrived shrimp was almost raw and sauce was not vodka sauce.  On the plus side they had a good variety of beer on tap and it was nice and cold.  Service was below minimum standards.  The manager did take the pasta dish off of the bill and discounted the pizza even though we told them not to, so that was a nice gesture.    I won't be coming back.  If you want good pizza in Ahwatukee stick with Nello's (especially the wood fire) or Florencia!  They both have far superior pizza."}
{"text":"Spinatos is one of my favorite pizza restaurants! I am gluten free and it is hard to find great food, but they make a great pizza! And the gluten free garlic bread is to die for!!"}
{"text":"My husband had gone to a different location than Ahwatukee and said how great it was.  He stopped on the way home from work one night and got us a pizza.  I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest."}
{"text":"They refused to deliver to my location due to lost time to the driver, even though it was only two miles out from their arbitrary border zone. When I offered to compensate for the \"lost time\" to the driver for 2 miles, the manager refused in a very condescending and incendiary manner.   Their pizza is insanely delicious, but their rationale for refusing to go 2 miles beyond their border is pretty much nonsense. Uncompromising and unwilling to serve the customer's needs. But I guess when you are Spinatos, you don't have much incentive to treat customers as anything other than disposable. I mean, what is anyone going to do about it, boycott the best pizza in AZ? Eat Pizza Hut? Yeah, I probably wouldn't either..."}
{"text":"If I could give Spinato's 10 stars I would! That's how much we like this place. Their food is always delicious, the service is great and I'm oh so happy that they opened one closer to my house.   They have daily specials, a great kids menu and awesome desserts. Their pizza is amazing (you can order 1/2 and 1/2 for their toppings), their pasta is super yummy, but our fav is by far the calzones! Those are to die for! We came here a lot when I was pregnant and after our baby was born, we went back with him...they gave him his first Spinato's shirt!  If you go to the Tempe location, you won't be able to get pasta, just an FYI."}
{"text":"Best pizza and the worst service. They have a bunch of young girls working the front host station and they all have no clue how to smile and greet guests warmly. They are stone faced and only care about texting on their phones. The pizza...to die for. My suggestion, don't dine in, just do take out and skip the horrible service."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, and Spinatos is by far the best pizza in az.  Just like south side Chicago pizza, thin crust.  Amazing sauce like no other.  Delivery takes a bit but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Very attentive. Food was good, but a bit pricier than expected. Dinning area cramped."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love how family oriented the place has remained over the years. Always a fan. I even got my sisters hooked. It's our go to for happy hour. The small pizza is large enough to feed all 3 of us...If you add a cocktail, wings, and salad of course. But spilt 3 ways at $10 a piece, it's more than enough food."}
{"text":"YUCK! Why does everyone rave about this place? The pizza crust is TOO thin - it was SOGGY!  And they cut a ROUND pizza in SQUARES!!! WTF??? So I wound up with little weird-shaped outer pieces, and two large SQUARE center slices that were SO soggy that they just hung down when I tried to pick them up. Soggy and greasy.   The cheese and mushrooms were good, but the sauce was indeed WAY too sweet as others have noted, and the so-called 'crust' was nasty and mushy. This is NOT Chicago pizza! I've had pizza in Chicago, deep dish AND regular, and this was NOT like any of it."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite pizza places and let me tell you, I'm not a fan of pizza. Pizza is too basic and too greasy for me. But this place has been one of my favorites for the last several years. One of the first times I ever had this place I think I had blue ice cream. Or green. It was pistachio flavored and it was so good. SO GOOD. The prices are good. The pizzas are great. If I do get pizza I like to get bacon and pineapple or something more interesting. Like the Sicilian. That one is good too. Their cannolis are yummy as well. I can't believe I haven't been here in awhile. I'll have to come back here and mention if anything has changed. Oh and they have to go as well so that's good."}
{"text":"Spinato's makes the best pizza in Arizona. The sauce is amazing and the classic thin crust is the greatest ever. Service is always friendly and non intimidating. Everything is fresh and flavorful. Wings are absolutely delicious.  I recommend the Spinach, strawberry Gorgonzola salad. Big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is my jam. I like to go here when I want to take a break from the deep dish pizza from Oreganos and Lou Malnatis. I like the sweet sauce and I don't feel like a fat zombie after eating here. This is my favorite thin crust pizza around."}
{"text":"Right up there with Grimaldi's as my favorite pizza in Arizona.  Spinato's pizza is delicious.  The crust is thin and a little chewy, the toppings are fresh, but what sets their pizza apart is the sauce.  The sauce has this rich sweet flavor that is absolutely amazing.  My favorite: pepperoni, onion, and bell pepper"}
{"text":"How amazing is this place. New to the area and came in for happy hour with my daughter. The waitress was very welcoming and warm.   The chicken presto pesto pizza for 9 bucks was on point.  Flavors were perfect and amazing. Pizza was cooked perfectly, thin crispy crust but tender."}
{"text":"Love the place, good lord their pizza is mouth watering good. The signature spinach pizza is definitely to die for. Highly recommended.  Spinatos - Yummy in my tummy... mmmm !"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for a long time now, and I have never had a bad meal!  The food is great and so is the staff.  Try the spaghetti calzone, yup it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Only my first time but I like how I can customize calzone size. Didn't like the sauce on the inside.  I also didn't like that it doesn't come with sauce. I'm from back East and I've never seen that before... It tasted good, though. Not like a calzone, more like a rolled up pizza for $10. With that being said I stand by the 4 stars because the flavors were on point, fresh, well seasoned, beautiful, but the overall creation was a bit off..."}
{"text":"I ordered by phone and service was friendly, Pizza was a custom Large Pepperoni,  Onion and mushroom which was great and arrived hot, The garlic bread was good but I wish there was more for price. Delivery guy was professional and quick having plates and condiments. For your regular pizza fix Spinatos hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new restaurants!    I have been there 3 times now and everything I have ordered there has been really good!  They have such a variety of great foods (pizza, pasta, sandwiches, calzones, etc) and very high quality.  And I have never had an issue with their service.  I even went once with a group of 22 people from work and they did a great job handling our enormous party!  I can't wait to go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Let me just say, don't waste your time going elsewhere. I especially enjoy sausage, pepperoni with fresh basil."}
{"text":"Always the best pizza, hands down! Get your pizza with fresh basil. It is ummmm ummm melt in your mouth scrumptious.  Calzones are dough overload.  Can't say anything about service, I do takeout."}
{"text":"They really need to bring back the spinach and artichoke dip!! Lost a star from me because they recently took it off the menu."}
{"text":"First off, I will definitely be a repeat customer. I shared a spaghetti and meatball calzone and a super six pizza; Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  30 minutes for a personal pizza is not acceptable.  Bartender, we were at at bar with our kids, said 25-27 minute ticket times are their normal.  What???  Place has 11 tables and 6 people at the bar.  Management needs to step up.  We used to come here a lot...now I remember why we don't.  Not enough time....  Kids are done with food before we even got our.  This is sad....we used to love this place.  Manager confirmed 30 minute ticket time.  So....unless you have über amounts of time..."}
{"text":"I do not even want to give them a star. I had the worst food poisoning from this place. All I can say is I was in the bathroom for a day straight. I cautious you if you care about your stomach don't attempt to eat here."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Presto Pesto (the bomb!), the Margherita Pizza and the Going Greek Salad, everything was FANTASTIC! We are traveling and therefore ordered delivery to our hotel... quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried it once more since Lucky's closed I have to find a new pizza place. Sigh....  Service is excellent they knew immediately what we ordered last time. We tried the signature pizza this time since its the most popular. The delivery was very quick I admit but the pizza still leaves me looking for a new pizza place. The toppings were all good spinach nice and crispy and then the sauce is good but way too sweet for my taste! It makes me wonder if the secret seasonings have something to do with sugar? Oh well I really tried liking this since its so close but what can a girl do?"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh YUM!! I went in thinking I'd just have \"a small slice\"... well this turned into my cheat meal. We got \"Nicole's Favorite\" which had fresh basil, mozzarella, feta, and pepperoni. We asked to make half with sun dried tomatoes as I don't eat meat. The sun dried tomatoes were very good on it. The pizza was extremely fresh and the basil tasted like it was just picked off the vine. The pizza was piping hot and fresh out of the oven. Atmosphere is more of an upscale pizza joint with nice decor. It wasn't busy around the time we went, around 4:00 I believe? The kids working there were polite, not overly customer service oriented but I have no complaints. The pizza did take about 40 minutes to come out but that's only because of how fresh everything is, it's well worth the wait. If you are wanting to indulge in some fresh and greasy pizza here's your spot!"}
{"text":"A Great Pie.  I'm originally from NY, and it's always a challenge to find a great Italian Pie. I have eaten lots of pies at  lots of pizzerias, and I have  to say that Spinato's Pizzeria is one place that serves up a delicious  pies.  Spinato's is Not just another pizzeria; they have a full menu and a product line with sauces and salad dressings. Today, I was fortunate enough to have tried Spinato's for the first time at a Holiday Party and I can't praise the food enough.    I tend to be picky when it comes to pizza pie and Spinato's doesn't disappoint. The crust on Spinato's pizza pie is thin, and the sauce is perfectly sweet (no acidic taste). The toppings go completely to the edge of the pie and the pizza is cut into squares. These pies are the perfect combination of sauce, toppings, and crust.  In addition to Spinato's delicious pies, Spinato's offers great salads. I really enjoyed the Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad made with fresh baby spinach, strawberries, candied pecans, and gorgonzola.  The ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and chicken Alfredo,  were also delicious.  Spinato's will be added to my list of  favorite pizzerias."}
{"text":"The sauce is usually the under-appreciated element of pizza, but it's front and center at Spinato's.  One's opinion of Spinato's hinges almost totally on his opinion of the unusually sweet sauce.  After yesterday's experience, I've decided that I love Spinato's as on occasional treat, but it's a little rich to be my go-to pizza place.  Everything besides the sauce on the pizza was nearly beyond reproach.  The crust was thin and crisp, but not like a cracker.  It still had some chewiness.  The aforementioned sauce and cheese went nearly out to edges of the pie.  The pizza was cut into squares and toppings were carefully and evenly applied.  The mushrooms were outstanding because they're the canned mushrooms that remain plump and juicy when cooking.  The bell peppers and ricotta cheese were OK, although the ricotta added even more sweetness.  One renegade black olive somehow made it on my pizza, which I found endearing.  If you're not in a pizza mood, they have a full menu with sandwiches, salads, calzones, etc.  They actually have a calzone stuffed with spaghetti.  On a previous visit, we ordered it just as a conversation topic, leading to jokes like \"... so why are Americans getting fatter?\"  I have to admit that the little carbohydrate bomb was pretty tasty.  Nothing was special about the restaurant itself.  (After all, it's a converted Chili's.)  But the pizza is special.  It's high quality and definitely distinctive, which is rare to say about pizza."}
{"text":"My father and I come in almost every Tuesday to each lunch.  They staff here treats us like family.  At 86 my Dad sometimes repeats his stories, but the staff just goes along with it.  I want to thank all of you for making my Dad feel special.  The food is excellent, I recommend this location to everyone.  They are attentive, pay attention to all the details and treat their customers like royalty."}
{"text":"So-so pizza and the service was about the same... ok, but nothing to write home about, especially if you happen to be Itialian."}
{"text":"The food here has always been outstanding, regardless of location. One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the country . . .  The sauce is incredible and Nicole's New Favorite pizza is a must if you are in the mood for a departure from typical.  The new location is somewhat impressive, but I also miss the charm of the former, smaller spot on Glendale."}
{"text":"Still great tasting pizza.....don't think I've ever had a bad one there !!!  Best Chicago style pizza this side of the missisipi !!!  Happy hour pizza saves you a little cash......an ex employee......"}
{"text":"Would've been 5 stars had the service been a little faster. I believe we waited about 40-50 minutes for our entrees. However I was very impressed by their selection of gluten free items. I was even more impressed how they tasted, as anyone whose had gluten free bread products knows it can be a hit or a miss. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza gluten free with an olive oil base since I'm allergic to tomatoes. It was wonderful. Chicken was juicy, pesto tasted fresh, cheese was nice and chewy and not overly greasy. The gluten free crust was flaky and similar to a biscuit,  which was amazing compared to the other gluten free pizza doughs I've had that taste like cardboard. I also ordered the gluten free garlic cheesy bread, as I couldn't remember the last time I've gotten to have garlic bread since I'm gluten free. It was amazing, chewy and buttery and everything I'd want it to be. I will definitely be back since the food was wonderful and hopefully the service will be a little more prompt."}
{"text":"One of my familys favorite neighborhood spots. Great food and always friendly service! Thank you Spinatos!"}
{"text":"Used to love coming here. But management has changed and service is  not the same.   Beer glasses with lipstick stains on the glass.  Wait staff is not attentive as once previously was.  Pizza still tastes good, the only reason why the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Four of us just had dinner here and we will be back.   Very good pizza. We all had side salads and interestingly, two salads were Caesar, one great, the other soaked in dressing.  She only ate around the edges and left 3/4 of it.  I would have asked them to replace or add more romaine.  That was the only complaint."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. Maria was an awesome server. I highly recommend you make reservations, especially on the weekends. This place can accommodate groups, but the wait will be considerable on the weekends."}
{"text":"My favorite!  Just like Aurelios back home if you're from the South Side of Chicago or NW Indiana."}
{"text":"Add me to the Maria fan club. Seriously, I love that chick. Hand to God, if I ever had to fight in a trench, in a war, the first person I would want on my team would be Maria. She's a doll but she might kick your ass. \"For sure!\"  We started with the spaghetti calzone. Yeah, you heard me. They take spaghetti and they stuff it in a calzone. In. A. Cal. Zone. It reminded me of when I was a kind and we would make spaghetti sandwiches. No, I'm not kidding about that. It was delicious and I have dreams about it. They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good.   The sauce for the pizza and the calzone is a happy thing. Tangy but sweet, as well. I could eat with we a well bent spoon. The pizza was good but we only got a small due to the calzone. Next time, I want to go with more people and get a bigger one so I can love on the cheese and toppings.  Lastly, the sodas come with that really awesome crushed ice that looks like jagged little pellets. To me, that's a clear sign you're in a good pizza joint."}
{"text":"I tried \"the beef\" specialty pizza, and really enjoyed it.  It was almost like a philly cheese steak pizza.  Overall I thought that the pricing was pretty good, and I liked the portion sizes as well.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"If I gave this review in November of last year, it would have been 5 stars. Back then the service was nice, quick, and the pizza was delicious. However, the only thing that remains is the pizza, and that's it. The service is now awful. I went there with my family, and we were told 20-25 minutes. Nope. We were seated... 1 hour and 15 minutes later! We sat down and it took another 15 minutes for us to meet our waiter, and she didn't even introduce herself. In fact, we had to ask the servers at the front what her name was. I know it was busy, but she was only waiting us and one other table. She asked us what our drinks were with a look on her face that she did not want to be there. There was no \"Hi, how are you doing? What would you like to drink?\" It was just, \" what do you want.\" No clarity or anything. After a lengthy amount of time she brought our drinks... Well most of them. She forgot 3 of them. We had to tell her she forgot some and then she brought again some of them. It took me asking 3 times and 45 minutes to get a simple glass of water. She later came and took our order, still with an angered face. She then put in our order. Well most of our order. She forgot my sisters order. She said \"the kitchen forgot to make it.\" This was untrue, because of the receipt it said \"on the fly\" meaning she forgot to input the order. When it finally came out after we were all done eating, she said \"here.\" With an angry tone and dropped the pizza on the table while nearing hitting my sisters head with it. The only good part of the experience was the food and the staff up front (even though it took awhile it wasn't their fault). I have gone there 3 times this year. Hoping it would be better. It wasn't. This is compared to the like thirty times last year.   TL;DR (Too long; didn't read) The service sucked, pizza was good. All in all, bring back Bobby Carzoo. He was what made this place amazing. Sorry to say, but this place needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"THE ROASTED FENNEL AND ITALIAN SAUSAGE.  Comes with Sausage, Fennel, fontina, asiago mozzarella, balsamic glaze and fresh oregano. It's been a LONG time since I've had such a high quality and flavorful pizza. I personally prefer this pizza over oregano's.   Happy hour got me a small pizza for just $9 instead of the regular $13.29."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Spinato's the other day and had some thin crust pizza and a baked spaghetti calzone.  All the food was delicious, especially the baked spaghetti calzone, which was something unique. The pizza was a bit too greasy for us, but some people like it that way.  They also had a nice little outdoor patio area, but it was too windy at the time for us to sit there.  Plus, great beer on tap to boot! They carry New Belgium's Fat Tire and Four Peak's Kiltlifter on tap. Thank you!  They have a specific happy hour special for each day of the week, so check out their deals schedule before picking a night to dine there.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place smeels incredible when you first walk-in. The major plus was that when you ordered, and received your food, (which by the way was friendly service with a smile and not a lengthy wait) it actually tasted as good as it smelled!   We will definitely go back for another visit! I love the small, but family friendly environment as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs there and all of the customers were great, all interacting with perfect strangers. Just a really great vibe!   The only thing I would mention is that personally I prefer a more savory or herby flavor in my pizza sauce, and their is very sweet. My husband LOVED IT! I liked it too, but it got to be too sweet for my \"buds\" after a few bites.   AWESOME PLACE THOUGH! check it out."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. ALWAYS order your pizza extra crispy it makes it perfect and adds that extra crisp with all those fresh vegetables. I love da Greek it's the perfect pizza for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the raves for this place. We tried their pizza once in the past and it was totally forgettable, but we were so swayed by all the 5 star reviews we thought we'd try it again. We ordered the medium 14\" Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach. Menu price is $18 but with the $4 (!) delivery charge, tax and tip this medium pizza cost us almost $30.  We were told delivery would be 40-45 minutes but the pizza took almost 70 minutes to arrive. (Ordered at 5:20 pm on a thursday.) The pizza was barely lukewarm on arrival but we were so starved we each had a slice while the rest went into the oven to re-heat. The pizza isn't terrible, it just isn't great and certainly not worth the price. The sauce and spinach mixture on the Signature is sooooo very sweet and there is nothing else on this pie to break up that sweetness. It barely satisfied our craving for actual pizza.  Also, for some reason this round pizza is cut into squares, so you end up with edge pieces that have a nice crisp crust on them and then you have this whole section of soggy middle pieces with no crust at all. We ended up eating around the outside and I guess the middle will go into the trash.  All in all we are putting this on the \"never again\" list. We can get a delicious pizza from Aiello's that is nearly twice the size for the same cost and it will usually arrive on time.  I will say the person who answered the phone and the guy who delivered the pizza were both very nice."}
{"text":"New addiction, Spinato's Steak Calzone.  First off, I have never been a fan of Calzone's as they typically are heavy on dough and light on ingredients. This is quite the opposite at Spinato's.  The dough is light and flakey and fillings are full and flavorful.  The calzone also comes with a side of beef au Jus.  Warning, the small size at $9.00 can easily feed 2."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple veggie pizza, told 30 minutes. Have been waiting 45....Not happy with this place...."}
{"text":"After reading all of the rave reviews for Spinato's we decided to give it a try.  We get pizza for Friday dinner often and I was looking for something better and closer to home.  This location is a few blocks off of my normal route, so I put in an online order for two pizzas.  Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.   We had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical. At the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.   No such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \"I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\"  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.    KFC for dinner.  A half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \"We have your pizza waiting\".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.    Then to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.  Not done . . .  My daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.  OK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.  So I run 20 miles each way to pick-up the same order they had lost at the first store and picked it up from another location.   You can get better pizzas from the grocer's freezer.    The crust is flat, no edge, looks like it was runout on a sheeter (machine that rolls out dough).   The sauce is tasteless, and just that, canned tomato sauce.    The meats were also bland, who would expect that from a sausage and pepperoni pizza?  People, this is not good pizza. . ."}
{"text":"I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos!"}
{"text":"Spinato's how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. First, your delicious sauce. It's sweet goodness at its finest. In fact, the sauce is so delicious, we always ask for extra sauce on our order! Second, your soft and chewy crust, just perfectly cooked. Third, the toppings, especially the sweet sausage that goes perfectly with the sweet sauce.   As you can tell, I simply love Spinato's. It's one of my top go-to pizza parlors for either dine in or take out. This location is homey and very friendly. It reminds me of a family pizza parlor during my childhood days. The staff is welcoming, the service is top notch and the food, well the food is simply supreme. They also have a bar with some tvs, in case you want even more casual dining and the takeout is perfect. The takeout is fast and they keep your food warm in a heater while they wait for you to pick it up."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pizza eater but when I do, it has to be fabulous. Spinato's lives up to its reputation for having really good pies. I tried a large mushroom and antipasti salad. Both were very good and I would recommend this for someone looking for a good pizza spot. It's not the best I've ever had, so it gets 4 stars, but it's definitely yummy!!"}
{"text":"I had the antipasto salad. My kids had pasta and pizza and the sauce was delicious! Will definetly go back!"}
{"text":"I like trying new pizza joints, but by far, Spinatto's is the best pizza I've ever had. I've turned so many people onto Spinato's that I should get a kickback. Every time I come to Phoenix it's where I want to go eat. If you like thin crust pizza with a sweeter sauce, this is the pizza for you.  It's so good that it's hard to stop eating it.  I even took a pizza back to Tucson with me - how crazy is that?!  The service is always spectacular; the employees always come across as they love their job.  I've been to every Spinato's in the valley and have had the same great service in every store.  I even bought a jar of their pizza sauce - it was worth the price.  I've tried a few of the other appetizers and salads; they were good, but why waste stomach space?"}
{"text":"Service was great even though it's a Chicago Bar and we were on the last game of the World Series Aundria did a great job. Pizza was really good the secret is in the sauce... meatballs were okay salad with apples and pecans ok half priced bottles of wine on Wednesday are a winner.  That compensated for the Groupon I missed this week. Pass on the tiramisu but the cannolis were freshly filled. We will go back the Italian beef is next."}
{"text":"This is how pizza is suppose to taste, a direct quote from my son when we brought home left overs, so good, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st timer, definitely will be back. The Cesar Salad entree portion was enough for me, my hubby, and my 6yr old. BEST part is that they have HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY 2-6pm including weekends! !"}
{"text":"I love this place.. the pizza here tastes like it did when I was a kid.. back when pizza had a certain mystery and allure.. the smell of cooked pepperoni and not being able to see over the counter to tell what the smell was.   Every time I eat here it just takes me back to being the fat little kid I was and kind of still am."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this restaurant. Visited here for the first time recently and absolutely loved their Caesar salads + pizza. Amazing! Highly recommend. And affordable!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Best pizza ever!! The entire crew is always wonderful and they never disappoint with food"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my parents! Their thin crust pizza is heaven and it is all thanks to the SAUCE they use.  We will keep going back since it is so good and everyone is so nice there!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Chicago style....I'm a NY boy. So takes Some getting used to. And where I come from Calzone is filled with ricotta and mozzarella- here, not at all. White pizza doesn't exist. Takes getting used to but great staff and service. I wish people from Chicago could learn how to make pizza instead of just hot dogs....but it's definitely high quality once you get over your New York self."}
{"text":"i was really, really, really impressed and surprised at Spinatos pizza.  we ordered a large sweet pepper and onion at a friends place last night. it was over the top scrumptious.   plenty of cheese and a generous sprinkling of oregano on top lended an absolutely delicious pie! this one goes under my favorites....perhaps up there with Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Good experience at this place - great food and apps. I called ahead from 5 minutes away and there was no wait for a table of two. When we got there, it was a 45 minute wait, which was irritating, but that's what happens sometimes on a Friday night! We ended up sitting at the bar and still had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"This is what pizza tastes like in heaven. The pie is divine, calzones are outstanding and the staff make you feel like family. Spinato's is our go-to pizza joint and we have never been disappointed. Definitely want to get there early to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!  The absolute worst pizza I ever had.  Soggy, half the sausage you would expect.  Just a half ass mom and pop place that cuts corners"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Not sure what these haters are talking about. Pizza and chicken parm are amazing...bar area and patio are nice. Prices are very reasonable..service is always good."}
{"text":"I recommend eating the pizza at the restaurant, otherwise it gets really soggy and oily sitting in the takeout boxes.  My only bad experiences have been for takeout.  I think the quality of the ingredients is excellent and the sauce is delicious - sweet yet very flavorful!  They updated the menu and now feature tiramisu (finally!).  I recommend the Italian sausag and fennel, which comes with a balsamic drizzle.  Delish!  Excellent pizza in Ahwatukee - just eat it at the restaurant or either order it extra crispy.... unless you like soggy crust."}
{"text":"This pizza could be pretty good.  That being said, the sauce is way to sweet.  We're talkin ketchup type sweetness.  I know a lot of people like this type of sauce by the reviews I read, but it doesn't work for me at all.  I much prefer a simple sauce that stands out on its own.  Try Full House Pizza (Kyrene / Chandler) instead.  Their sauce is excellent and cheese grated fresh before it is put on the pie."}
{"text":"Took my wife out to this place for lunch, NOT impressed with the service at all... Didn't mine the wait for seating took about 20-25mins  and we were okay with it, till we got to our table a lot of crump under the table and the waiter that we got is a piece of work, she got us our drinks never come back to refill our drinks, she served us like we owned her something, the food was okay but it will make it all better if our waiter will smile for ones? We had to chase her down for our bill so we can get out off there...  I would not recommend this place for anybody due to lack of service, not friendly, they are rude and the cleanest don't keep up with there place....."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. My first time getting the personal size. Thin crust sausage and mushrooms.   Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time having Spinato's pizza and both times have been pickup orders from this location. I ordered \"Nicole's Favorite\" which is a specialty pizza the first time around. It was amazing. This time I created my own and it was slightly less enjoyable, but they was because I didn't order the same type of crust. I like very crisp crust and the first pizza achieved that because the crust was very thin. This pizza wasn't as crisp towards the middle of the pizza as the last. I also ordered the meatballs this time around. The meatballs were pretty great. This place has the best marinara sauce hands down. The meatball was cooked to near perfection. It was well done but it wasn't over cooked. I am a bit of a pizza whore and I think I just found a new go to pizza spot."}
{"text":"I love this place, and although sad that they moved further away from my house, I am really happy for these guys in their amazingly large by comparison new restaurant with the separate take out door...such a great improvement over the 12th street mob scene.  We usually order pick up here and although the pizzas are a little pricey, they NEVER disappoint.  I am fan of the plain ol cheese pizza and these guys knock it out of the park.  I crave Spinato's cheese pizza and I love the Chicago square cut slices.    Always order these guys pie during a special occasion and I must say that I am hooked for life!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Arizona, family owned, great for pizza.  The sauce has a unique flavor, a bit on the sweet side but rich, and paired with a classic pepperoni or something with a touch of spice rounds the flavor out for a great pizza!  My fiance took my dad here when he asked for his blessing and permission to marry me!"}
{"text":"I ablsolutely love Spinato's pizza. I moved here from the east coast and have been very disappointed by the pizza out here but Spinato's is delicious. My favorite part of the pizza is the sauce, it's very rich, savory, and sweet."}
{"text":"Chicago girl loving Chicago style pizza! Yummmmmmmy! That is all I can say. Probably one of the best pizzeria in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok the food is decent. Definitely not the best in PHX. I originally used this company because I support local businesses. I use spinatos also for my customers at my bar (we don't have a kitchen) but little did I know, they ONLY deliver from 4pm- 9, or 10pm. And the delivery time is ALWAYS an hour- 1:15min... I usually end up calling them back because they're late, yes it ends up being 1:30 min. Not super happy with the delivery service."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta and pizza entrees! We enjoyed our food and the customer service was awesome! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Scottsdale, hand down.   The sauce is what makes these pies delicious, never had anything like it before. The cheese and thin crust add to the flavor, makes it very easy to dip the pieces into a plate of olive oil.   I've always picked up the food, never have experienced the dinning room atmosphere, but if your in the neighbor hood, I would try it out. Don't waste another dollar on the big pizza chains, Spinato's is well worth the extra money.    When friends come  into town, here is my to-do list:  1. Introduce Spinato's into their life. 2. Everything else.   Maybe I just like pizza too much..."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Restaurant!!! We ordered the meatballs and Get Meaty pizza.   Excellent service from the minute we walked in.  The hostess even came to the door to hold it open for our entire party.   Our waitress was very attentive as we were dining with two little ones.   The food and drinks were excellent.  We ordered the red velvet cake covered with chocolate call tortein, amazing combination. Highly recommended.   We will definitely be back and enjoy the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I USED to love them when they were a 1 location restaurant off of Glendale. Maybe they had more, but I felt is was very hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop, with great quality and care.  Tonight we ordered from the Bell Rd location. We asked for light sauce, and the pizza came without sauce. There was way too much spinach overload on the pizza, and mounds of garlic that made every bite taste just like, well, garlic.   Their breadsticks with mozzarella was the equivalent to poor man homemade breadsticks. Melt the cheese on a slice of bread.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've been going to Spinato's Pizza for a few years now and it's one of my favorite places to come eat when I'm craving a pizza. My roommates and I always order a large pizza and the Antipasto Salad to share.  They cut the pizza into tiny slices so it's easy to eat and we always have leftovers."}
{"text":"I gave this place another try.  I ordered their Caesar salad with chicken, there was nothing to set it apart from a fast food type of salad.  My boyfriend and daughter were unable to finish even 1/3 of the large cheese pizza, so he is downgrading his previous experience of \"phenomenal\" to no need to eat here ever again.   Oh well."}
{"text":"Hosting... horrible. We were told 20 min didn't get seated until 1 hr and 30min. Manager did not apologize, instead responded with multiple excuses. Later after being seated in the bar, because there was no place else in the restaurant to seat us even though the manger said he opened a back room for us, one of the members of the party found a long piece of hair in their food... I think this place has definitely earned their 1 star from me."}
{"text":"Super greasy pizza is not my thing.  That perfect, just-the-right-amount-of- grease, well THAT is an entirely different story!  LOL!   Luckily, that is what Spinatos is....just the right amount of grease and Chicago Style Pizza!  Their Fresh \"Signature\" Spinach pizza is something that gives you CRAVINGS- even if you are not hormonal.  Honestly, if you like roasted garlic, you will LOVE this pizza.  They have another spinach one that everyone at our office went ga-ga over, but to me, the Fresh Signature Spinach is even more spectacular.   Yummy salads (HUGE portions- even the individual ones are enough for several people).  Good service- mostly friendly staff (the one unhappy older blond lady hasn't been there for awhile, so I am hopeful that the sole grump who worked there is gone!)    Good prices.  We like to order a pizza with half grown-up-ish, and half cheese (the kids like their traditional thin crust better than the kid's portion individual cheese pizza's which are a thicker crust).  Many pizza places charge you for the more expensive half, but Spinatos charges you the middle price (between the expensive and inexpensive halves).  Little things like this make you feel appreciated and not taken advantage of.  And it is just a plain ol' fair thing to do.    So if you like Chicago Style Pizza (what on earth is the difference between Chicago and New York style anyway?), then you will really like Spinatos.    Happy eating!  Warmly,  Kirin :)"}
{"text":"I know, I know, 3 stars only. Sorry folks I come from an Italian family... I believe that the sauce makes the meal. Sorry, but I could barley taste a hint of garlic in the sauce and even that could have been a piece lodged in my tooth from lunch. If you are a sweet sauce non-traditional, Ragu, Papa John's loving type of Americanized pizza type person.....you'll love it!!! But if you dare to go to to the dark side of good old fashioned Italian-American cusine, you'll find yourself, as I did searching for more out of your local pizza shop.  On the bright side the place was packed, the ingredients were fresh, and the service was good.  I don't want to be to negative or longwinded so I will say only this about the dough, it was average. So if you like sweet sauce, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Phoenix. I have never dined in, only take out, but it is always crowded. The pizzas have a very unique flavor, my guess is that it has to do with the sweet sauce and thin crust. The ingredients are fresh and I have never had a bad pizza. We always get half italian sausage for my mom and half basil for me. My mom will eat hers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews about this place before joining another couple for date night here.  It was a Friday night and the other couple chose this place - which was fine until we showed up and there was a 20 minute wait.  I understand places get busy, especially on a weekend.  That said, there are SO many options in this valley of the sun that I have avoided any wait these past few years, because, well, I don't like it.  We finally got seated, and I realized (this is the pre-food opinion) it was basically Olive Garden.  I have nothing against kids or families, but on date night I don't like having crayons thrown at me unless I can throw them back.  This isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault per se, but an ambiance that welcomes this type of behavior / parents who let their kids run wild isn't my idea of fun (yet).  The drinks were fine, the Greek salad was really tasty & the pizza was decent.  Service was so-so, I can remember nothing about our waitress other than we were helped more by passers by and busboys.  Let me be clear, I'm not trashing Olive Garden - it serves a purpose in the biz, but it's not an atmosphere / environment that I want when it's date night and I'm trying to have good conversation with friends.  It's possible that this review may change when I'm the dude with rowdy kids, but for now, until that day, there is no reason to rush out and experience this joint."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the world.  I live in Los Angeles now but make sure I get it every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Checked out this place cause it happened to be nearby and had happy hour.   They do hh from 2-6pm and we ordered the following from that menu:  - Baked Artichoke Crostini  - Piccola Wings  - Caesar Salad  - and a couple of beers   While the salad was passable, everything else besides the beer was lackluster. We felt full especially since the food is so heavy, but not in a satisfied way (which is the worst!)   Service was great though and if you are trying to watch any games, they do have a good amount of TVs around the bar area.   The only saving grace was the pizza. We actually ordered a small pizza to-go and did half and half of the Roasted Fennel & Italian Sausage and the Salsiccia Di Pollo. We took it back and tried it a few hours later and it was still yummy despite being cold. Very interesting flavors and toppings that do end up working well together.   Not sure if I would come back though since there are plenty of other pizza places I would prefer to go to. (And I generally like a simple margherita pizza any ways)."}
{"text":"I HATE when I have a preconceived review of a 5 star rating and I get disappointed. I just wish I tried this one for lunch not a full dinner.   Spinatos disappointed me big time.   The waitress was a ditz, seemed like she was busy thinking about drinking as soon as she got off work.   The pizza was OK... they did not ask what crust we preferred and we got the thin. (not my favorite)   The toppings were very sparse and not that fresh. (we got the 6 toppings on kinda like a \"everything\"   The sauce was so sweet I thought it was a frozen kid pizza.   The salad, while large, was brown wilted, bagged lettuce. The tomatoes were dry and colorless. We asked for garlic ranch and she gave us Italian. They do not have Blue Cheese dressing either   The ravioli was boring, the bread stick was hard and dried out.   She came by asked what type of gelato the kids wanted, came back 5 min later and had totally forgot she asked asked already.   I was not impressed at all by the entire meal."}
{"text":"So I actually love, love, love the food here BUT on multiple occasions they have failed in operations and service. Today was the last straw I had to write a review. I called to order a pizza they said a minimum of 2 hours for delivery, we said we'll pick it up, they said over an hour!! I asked what was going on, they said they RAN OUT OF PIZZA! On Sunday you managed to run out of product? This is not the first issue I've had with this location. On  another occasion they lost my order all together. After over an hour I called to follow up only to find out they couldn't locate it. They've been late on more then one occasion. I don't care how good your pizza might be, if you can't deliver it in a reasonable time or at all for that matter I'll have to take my business elsewhere. At the prices you charge, I'd expect more consistency in your operations. Let's at least figure out how to keep dough in stock, shall we?"}
{"text":"We ordered this in today at work for everyone and it was amazing. I love good pizza and this was good. The thick crust is awesome and the topping options are great. The prices are good for what you get and they even deliver."}
{"text":"The Very Best Pizza I have ever had, I'm 68 years old and have been around the world and country. The Super 6 is the one, but I sub black olives for the mushrooms yech. Outstanding food and service!"}
{"text":"A $50 meal, large calzone and large thin crust pizza. The calzone was a mess, it did not resemble a calzone, it looked like someone put topping on a pizza crust and folded it over like a quesadilla, and it was just about as thin... plus it was overcooked. We ordered two types of cheese on it and when we bit into it there was barely much cheese to be found. Also the calzone had an overly sweet marinara sauce. The thin crust pizza was hot when it got to our door and in our mouths, but yet again the sauce was overly sweet and the overall taste was semi palatable. So we both ate till we were physically full, but in the end we were far from satisfied and the price made the experience so much worse. We both agreed paying more than $20 for that meal would have been a ripoff. Lastly the guy who delivered it was so high that it was hard to understand him."}
{"text":"When I think thin crust, I expect it to be somewhat crispy.  This crust was definitely thin but was just sort of floppy with no crunch whatsoever.  It was disappointing.  The sauce is oddly sweet.  Sweet like someone accidentally dumped way too much sugar in the sauce.  I prefer a more acidic sauce to balance out the fatty meats.  For the same style pizza, Rosati's is WAY better.  Spinato's is not for me and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale, hands down! Friendly staff. Fast service... good salads as well. Take is out great. The reference your phone number and know what you ordered last... in case you'd just like to reorder the same thing. Very very convenient."}
{"text":"I'm like a Ninja Turtle -- Cowabunga! I can eat pizza everyday!  Master Splinter and I visited Spinato's, a Chicago style pizza joint.  Yum, definitely get the Nicole's Favorite cause it's mines too.  Sorry Nicole, it is now rename (Bo's Favorite) - onions, artichokes, salami, and a delictible pizza sauce -- mmmm.  Ambience was real chill, we sat at the bar area and I totally dig the posh chairs - Not Posh Spice, but I wouldn't mind :)  Our service was great, waitress was fun, knowledgable and helpful come decision time to order. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Simply, their pizza is off the hook!  We also ordered a gluten-free crust and liked it so much that we were concerned it wasn't really gluten-free.  In fact, we ordered the kids a regular pizza and after trying our gluten-free they cried when we told them they couldn't have any more of it.  Whether regular crust or gluten-free, this place is the real deal..."}
{"text":"Our first visit but not our last.....four of us ordered six items and they were all delicious.  Seth took care of us very well as my husband tends to be very picky and selective, he was very cool and helped us pick out our selections and they were all spot on... my husband loved his bolognese sauce over penne. Thanks Seth for a perfect fun dinner with friends!!!"}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to Spinatos.  When I first came here the service was abysmal, but lately they have really stepped up their game.  This place does a great job lately at being accommodating to customers and of course as always bringing out delicious food. My friends and I started coming here for the Chicago pizza, and no it is not the deep dish that city people know and love, but it is really good.  I promise. The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  They have some really good flavor combinations and a variety of pies to choose from.  Their sauce is sweet and tangy swirled over the top in a unique way.  The crust is buttery and spongy (I always get the \"deep dish\") with just the right amount of crunch.Also I got a cannoli on my birthday which was really tasty. I love Spinatos.  It is  great place to take my out of town visitors for great food."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices for drinks and food items but if you want to sit at the bar, you will have a wait most of the times due to it's  popularity but it's worth it.  Love the trio of meatballs, salads and pizzas.  OMG, the sauce is so delicious!  Bar staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"New to the Phoenix area we decided to give Spinato's a try - and so glad we did!  We ordered the large Calzone (it was great) and enjoyed this with a bottle of Meiomi red wine.  The server (Clint) was super friendly and did a superb job.  The manager (Matt) came out to check on us a well.  Overall it was a very nice dining experience and very reasonably priced.  The bar area is a much better ambience than the restaurant so ask for a table there.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is located at a perfect location for me and I normally call them as I walk to my car at work. By the time I drive from my office to here, they have my pizza ready for me.  I never dined in here but whenever I came to pick up pizza, service was always friendly, I am usually in and out very quick.  Pizza here is good, only problem is that drive home after I pick up pizza.  It smells so good, it is like a torture to drive to get home.  I tried different pizza so far and everything I had was good.  Someday I would like to come in to eat here to enjoy hot pizza. (warm, cold, next day pizza were all good but I am sure hot right out of the oven will be better!)"}
{"text":"I took my granddaughter there after the APS electric light parade.   I haven't been here for a while, and she likes spag and meatballs, therefore, we thought it would be perfect.     Yes, the children's menu does have spag and meatballs, and not just one but two large ones.  She ate so much, she said she was trying to move the food aside in her stomach to make room for more.   Alas, it didn't work.   Interesting phenomenon if it happened, though.  I ordered the chicken alfredo since I am a lover of cream sauces.   I wanted the pasta with the shrimp, but I understood from our server it was the small ones albeit they are called tiger shrimp on the menu.  My sweetie loved her spag and meatballs.   I tried it as well.  Not bad.   I don't care for the tomato-based sauces but the balls weren't bad.  I loved my chicken alfredo!   The pasta was not over cooked -- ughhh!! -- and the chicken was tasty and not rubbery.   The flavorings meshed just right with the ingredients included.    Gelato was included with the kids' meal.   My granddaughter asked for the chocolate.   She didn't care for it, but I did!   I was more than happy to relieve her of it.   Large pieces of chocolate that hit the spot.  I was glad I didn't overeat on the pasta!  Alexandra was our server, friendly and professional.   Yes, I'd return."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar last night.  The food was good and half price wine on Wednesdays was a nice surprise.  Service was OK but not great given there were only a few people at the bar.  Once we received our bill it appeared both entrees were mispriced.  We asked our server and she asked the manager.  Turns out my sandwich did not include cheese which was extra even though it was not presented this way and the menu makes no mention of it.  It also does not show as an add on the receipt.  Also turns out our server rang up a different but very similar pasta dish than what my wife ordered.  We got sorry both mistakes were my fault from the server and sorry the menu is confusing from the manager but no offer to take responsibility for it.  They basically said we screwed up but you are still paying for our mistakes.  Left a very bad taste for both my wife and I.  We eat out a lot and there are far too many good places to eat in Phoenix than to eat at one that is at best poorly trained and presented and at worst misleading and still refuses responsibility when they admit they have done wrong.  For $2, they have lost two customers for life.  Having now read a number of comments on Yelp, it appears there are more issues like this than you would expect and their misleading and aggressive pricing is a pattern.  If you do choose to eat here, be extra diligent about what you are ordering and ask if anything you have ordered is extra."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. The food is fresh. We had the strawberry gorgonzola salad and the spinach was so fresh, the salad dressing had so much flavor. We had pears instead of strawberries, but wish it had green apples instead, it still was an amazing salad.   I have been to the North Phoenix and Ahwatukee location and it was great both times. The north Phx location gets busy at night so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We came here one night for pizza and had an unpleasant surprise.  The pizza we had was so incredibly salty that after a piece I just couldn't eat anymore.  My mouth felt saturated with salt the entire evening.  The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I went there for a Saturday Lunch and ate at the bar. Bartender was busy but attentive and friendly. I'd like more Vegetarian and Vegan options but quality of service was top notch and it had a casual yet dressed up feel to it. I like that it is local. My only suggestion is some Vegan and Vegetarian and gluten free options, with more local variety, but besides that. I'd eat there again. :)"}
{"text":"Mama's Signature. Extra crispy. Eat the corners/crust pieces first.   and that is allllll you need to know to enjoy Spinatos.   The Bell Rd and Tempe locations are the best. Be prepared to wait a bit at this location; they do have great take-out service, which is quick and right next door to the dine in location. One of my fave Valley pizza places."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had!  We got delivery and it was only half the time they said it would take.  All toppings were fresh and delicious. The ends of the pizza were even crispy, just the way I love it.  Delivery guy was very sweet and even offered to go back to his car to get us paper plates. I appreciated that a lot."}
{"text":"** We were Pleasantly greeted at the door :) she even had the door opened for us as we approached. She held the door for us as we left as well. Sweet kid at door! She did a good job!  Food was just ok. It was affordable. Skip the artichoke app next time. The Apple pecan salad was fresh. I forgot to ask for dressing on the side!  Pizza was ok. I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"Love there pizza and great costumer service. I called in my order and walked up to the hostess and said \"I'm here to pickup my order\". She politely walked me to the delivery pickup area that I walked right by when I can in."}
{"text":"Okay, open for a month...still needs help. Short wait, beautiful decor...No light over our very loud bar table. Got food, but where is the appetizer?  Oh, it didn't get put in! Had seafood basilico, fresh seafood taste, not masked by the complete lack of spices. Seafood broth/sauce completely flavorless...Better with the table spices added. Wife had the vodka pasta Chicago style, she enjoyed it! Waiter offered a free dessert,  we declined. No discount,  no petks...not returning anytime soon.  As a Chicagoan,  always preferred Rosati's over Arullio's anyway!"}
{"text":"Delicious calzones! They are filling and tasty. It's my go to item on the menu. My husband loves the thin crust pepperoni pizza. Drinks are a little pricy but then they give you a gigantic cup so it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and calzones!  My daughters enjoy creating their own calzones when we go here.  You can have just about anything you like in them, even spaghetti!"}
{"text":"Nice large restaurant with a huge bar area.  Award winning pizza and great prices on pitchers of craft beer on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Always 5  with us!  Best darn pizza in Arizona. Thin crust meaty. Make sure to order it extra crispy."}
{"text":"Have been back for takeout a few times. I am trying some different sandwiches and personal size pizzas. All were delightfully delicious. Today was the turkey pesto on bruschetta with lemon aioli. The pizza was roasted fennel and Italian sausage. The crust thin and crispy. My husband has the get meaty and he gets that every time and loves it. They have some delicious sounding sandwiches and pizza combos. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately, our needs tended to consistently and the food was amazing! We had the meatball trio and the italian bread and butter as an appetizer followed by the BEST thin crust pizza i have ever had. The sauce has this sweetness about it that takes the pizza to the next level. This is for sure my new favorite pizza hands down!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had Spinato's in Uptown Phoenix. We got the Chicago pizza and Sweet Chili boneless wings. OMG. The flavors from the sweet peppers on the pizza were to die for. The wings had the same bountifulness of flavor. Larger portion than I would have expected as well. I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came by Spinato's while on a trip down to Phoenix by way of Yelp reviews. As I'm from Chicago I have a discerning palette for pizza (not a snob by any means I just like good pizza!) but it was a great choice! The Za was really tasty very similar to what I'd get in the Chi. Of course I opted for the thin crust Chicago (plus artichoke hearts), the toppings were fresh, sauce zesty, and the crust was buttery and soft yet semi-crispy (due to the amount of veg). As a result the only advice that I would offer up would be if you're getting a pie with veggies to get it a little well done to ensure a crispy crust (if that's your thing).   I had came to the restaurant at around 2:30 in the afternoon so it wasn't very busy but with that said Victoria (my server) was very attentive and offered me great customer service!  All in all I would say if you enjoy good thin crust pizza this spot will not let you down!"}
{"text":"More of a chain type place. Quality wasn't there for us. Sadly. The reviews make it sound like the Birthplace of Italian food in the USA."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch, just before the lunch rush. I was seated right away and my waiter was great! I decided on a personal size margherita pizza. It took about 15 minutes but was surprised by how small it was! I ate it in 3 minutes. If you're not super hungry, it's perfect but I was still hungry when I left! I have had other items on the menu before, I would highly recommend their stuffed mushrooms!!   Great pizza, clean restaurant, nice service. What more could I want?!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is always a solid choice, the pizza is good, but the highlight for me are the calzones always great and ridiculously large. Service can be inconsistent so that keeps me from the 5 Star review."}
{"text":"I sometimes come by in the afternoon to get a pizza for a staff meeting.  I have to say that the pizza is solidly good.  It is thoroughly cooked and adequately balanced with cheese and sauce.  Strangely enough the sauce tastes somewhat different each time I visit.  It is good, but sometimes are better than others.  This place definitely has issues with order taking.  I would say that the orders are outright wrong about 1 in 4 times.  A reasonable price for a reasonable pizza eating experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this location, great for a night out or a quick lunch with business partners."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here! Everything is fresh. It's our Chicago pizza place in the desert.  We usually sit at the bar with Sara the bartender. Sara is great! She always remembers our order!! Great local place"}
{"text":"Love Spinatos! It's my favorite pizza in the valley! The atmosphere is great! The patio is nice!"}
{"text":"Food is great!  Also the restaurant has an Awesome atmosphere. And to add you can make any pizza gluten free!! Very tasty"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town.  I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to stuff it all in mouth at once and risk suffocation.   It is true to the Chicago style thin crust... sweet sauce, gooey cheese and cut into squares.    Do yourself a favor the next time you want pizza....head here and grab a \"Get Meaty\" or \"Margherita\"."}
{"text":"Tasty!  Great thin crust pizza, love the bruschetta.  The sauce has a touch of sweetness which I really like and the servers are always good.  Sometimes there is a wait but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to Spinato's after hearing from everyone that it was an awesome place for pizza which I am proud to say is my favorite food. The sauce was super sweet which I didn't mind but the pizza just did not hold up to what I was expecting. The pizza that we got seemed like it was way overcooked to the point that it was almost burnt. The staff there was not the friendliest when we were there either which I was kind of surprised about."}
{"text":"I have gotten into the habit of ordering thin crust pizza from Spinato's on Friday afternoons on my way home so I don't have to cook. It is always delicious! The sauce is slightly sweet and the sausage is excellent. The food here is consistantly great and I will continue to go once a week!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizza in the valley by far. Multiple locations and to go desserts are fantastic."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to Spinatos on the evening of Saturday July 1st. I was extremely under the weather and worked a long day. We were seated at a table in the middle of a busy dining area. Our server Nick was so attentive and helpful. I even think he sensed I was under the weather. Nick went out of his way to make sure me and my mother were ok and kept our glasses filled and made sure our food was brought to us promptly. It is rare nowadays to have your waiter go above and beyond and give exceptional guest service. My mother and I had a wonderful meal. The calzones were brought out hot and tasted absolutely delicious! I would request to be seated in Nick's section as his service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice food and ambiance.  I appreciate the gluten free options.  The whole family enjoyed their food.  It's rough during weekend peak times.  I'm not a fan of waiting or crowds."}
{"text":"I've heard tons about Spinato's and my buddy insisted I needed to try it. Walking in, a hostess stand greets you directly to the front. To the right, a bar, to the left, the main dining room. We opted to sit on the covered patio.  Even though it was a warm day, the patio was shaded, and the mister system they had wasn't directly overhead which prevented you from feeling like you were getting rained on in the middle of dinner. We were greeted promptly by a server and our order was taken.  Food: The food was delicious. We ordered a Pepperoni, Jalepeno and Pineapple pizza. For all those who hate pineapple on pizza, grow some taste buds. When it's combined with heat, it's delicious! The sauce they use is a sweet sauce, which makes it pair with that combination especially well! The beers were good, and everything was served promptly.  Service: The service was great. We showed up, had a waiter at our table within five minutes of arriving and beers ordered. My personal benchmark is generally five minutes. Our food was ordered promptly thereafter, and when our beers were ready, a different waiter brought the beers.  I cannot exclaim how big of a fan I am of this method of service. I've run stores and understand how important it is to ensure your customer is number one, and this group treats service as a team, not as one person's job. When I ran stores, it was the same theory in place, and Spinato's has the methodology down solid.  Would I recommend Spinato's? Yes, the only downside is it is very pricey, but you are getting a great tasting product with it."}
{"text":"I live right across the street but for some reason this is the first time I've actually gone in and sat down and had dinner here. The atmosphere was very cozy and everyone was extremely friendly. You know how in some restaurants if you try to talk to anyone other than YOUR server you get dirty looks? Not here! Everyone was so nice and helped one another out. We got the spaghetti calzone and it was delicious. The cesar salad was very generic- made from iceberg lettuce instead of romaine and with bought in shredded parmesean cheese. I've had a take out sandwich from here before and wasn't impressed. Eating in was definitely better. We also had dessert. Sorbet was good. Canolis were very sweet. We got three (should have gotten one) and were a little shocked that the three canolis were the most expensive thing we ordered!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti Calzone - one of the best inventions ever! Combining a calzone crust with spaghetti is magic. The spaghetti sauce is a bit sweeter which I love.    The pizza is good though I still prefer Oregano's. I am a big fan of Spinato's sauce. They sell it and it's great to take home and put on your own food.  The place is a bit small and there can be a wait during peak hours but that's true for any good place in town. Molly was our wait person (not sure if she's still there) and she's friendly and provided great service."}
{"text":"Pretty neat spot to grab a slice. I had the pepperoni mushroom pizza on a Sicilian crust. The pizza was awesome!  The sauce is a little sweeter then I am used too, but it was delicious.  Staff was very friendly and overall it was a really great dinning experience."}
{"text":"Easy to find, Easy well lit parking, very nice looking building. Once inside, we were greeted and seated immediately...7:00 Sunday evening. We took a small table in the bar with stuffed chairs. Our server was there immediately with menus and for our drink order. A very personable and attractive young lady named Amanda...great attitude too. Prices on all items were rational and reasonable in my opinion.  We ordered wine and water, perused the menu and finally decided on a salad and sandwich for my wife and spaghetti marinara with sausage for me. Drinks came quickly as did her very well presented salad. The salad was shared a bit and was crisp, cold and fresh with a tasty homemade Italian style dressing. Within 10 minutes, we each had our entrees.  My wife's large turkey sandwich with chips was well made and well presented in a large basket. My pasta and excellent homemade sausage was in a good size pasta bowl and well dressed with marinara...lots of sausage just right on the sauce...the pasta was slightly al dente...just right...well cooked and firm.  Amanda was checking with us every 5 minutes or so and keeping drinks refilled. Very attentive but not overly so.  The bar area is filled with TV's and it was Sunday night football on all. No sound to interfere with our peaceful meal. The place is busy but not annoyingly so. As we were finishing our food, I engaged Amanda in a brief conversation about football in Phoenix and life in general. She was a bright and willing talker and our brief conversation was enjoyable. She brought us our check and cashiered for us as well.  The restaurant interior is nicely furnished, adequately lit and architecturally attractive...a very pleasant environment. Noise levels are low and there's sufficient aisle space so that there is no sense of congestion.  Overall, an enjoyable dining experience that I would happily repeat. I would recommend this to a friend.  $30 out the door with a tip for Amanda extra."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker at heart and it was difficult to find really good pizza out here.  Well say No more!!!! Spinato's is the best pizza I have had outside of NYC. I was pleasantly surprised when I was seated in a timely manner and the staff was extremely friendly. The aroma was ridiculous,...mozzarella cheese permeating the air. I was so hungry I didn't know what to order but we got the Mama's pie.  OMG... By far the best I have ever tasted.  Garlic, spinach and mozzarella cheese. This pizza gave me life and then some. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First off we LOVE Spinato's but the last 6-7 times we've called for delivery we've been given hour & 1/2 minimum wait times & frankly it's getting pretty tiresome. Tonight we were hungry for their renowned Spaghetti Calzone but were given AN HOUR & FORTY FIVE MINUTE delivery time AFTER we placed our order! Soooo frustrating! Looks like it's Papa Johns again tonight. Must be nice to have such a great business that you can continually turn down loyal & hungry customers. SMH!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in town. Service is great but the food is AWESOME. Try it once and you will be hooked my family loves it"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free pizza, by far!!! Super crispy and sauce is delicious. My favorite pizza in AZ,   gluten free pizza is better than the regular crust, trust me!"}
{"text":"We went here on the ravings of Brady Bogen on KUPD.  We have now been there twice in a month.  I get their Hawaiian (well, Canadian) pizza and am absolutely addicted to it.  My fiancé loves their calzones and my 13 year old son can eat an entire small cheese pizza in one sitting.  We will be back for his birthday in July.  By far my favorite pizza in town now."}
{"text":"We have been eating at these restaurants for over 20 years. The consistency is extraordinary for the amount of business they do. The pizza's are fabulous as are many of the other offerings. It should not have taken me so long to review them. Awesome!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza in town. Must try the mamma spinato pizza, its the best!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!   We got Nicole's favorite.  It was soooo good.   I love thin crust pizza and this pizza was among my favorites.  I only wished that the crust was crispier.   I would definitely eat here again next time we are in Scottsdale.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food. Tastes like they make their own Cesar dressing!  Our little vegetarian wanted cucumbers and tomatoes for lunch. Not on the menu...Mike, our server, made a lovely plate just for my 3 yr old granddaughter!  Great place!  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a sat afternoon and we were in the mood for pizza and he suggested Spinato's, mainly because it's his fav pizza joint and I'm willing to try new things, so why not.  We got their and the place wasn't very busy, and was seated right away. I ordered a salad, I didn't realize until after I ordered it how huge they are and split with my friend, it was very fresh and good! We ordered a med Super Six, let me tell you, best pizza crust ever!!! It was so delish! Look forward to another trip back and work my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to Spinatos for lunch with some friends,  and I didn't have pizza!! What you say??? Man my daughter works at a pizza joint and brings pizzas home and smells like pizza, let's just say I am pizza out!  So what did I have you ask??   I had the Michigan Ave sandwich,  it was a thin chicken breast with red peppers, arugula, some red onions & pesto mayo on a ciabatta bread with a caesar salad. The bread was prefect!  I didn't really care for the arugula, but that's just me, I should have asked for it without it and go heavy on the onions.   It was a good lunch, and I would go back again!"}
{"text":"I love the sauce at Spinato's!  They make a great pizza!  A must try in the Valley"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a medium size signature spinach pizza.  I think it might have been one of the best pizza I have ever had.  We had the pizza with thin crust as they had sold out of the Sicilian crust that evening."}
{"text":"Awesome environment! At every corner people were super welcoming and a young man was even at the door when we were entering and exiting holding the door for us! Our server was Taylor and she was super persistent and a pleasant waitress! She overheard it was my mothers birthday and surprised her with a cannoli at the end of our meal! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"We got thin crust cheese pizza and cheese garlic bread...... YUM!!!!  SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other location at 1219 E Glendale Ave, and the bell location is a lot less tucked away and has a nice patio too if you enjoy outdoor eating. The pizza is consistent with their Glendale Ave location. and if you've never had their pizza before I highly recommend  it  I could go on and on about growing up in Illinois and eating all the authentic Chicago pizza's. but I won't , because if there's one thing AZ is full of it's transplants bashing the local fare and raving about the food at home.  keep in mind they serve chicago style thin, which is a change of pace compared to the classic chicago style deep with the layer of sauce on top and the toppings stuffed in the middle. Typically with chicago style thin, some of the toppings will be under the cheese and it's generally a sweeter marinara than most are used to.  If you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time, I recommend ordering this with meatballs.  but personally I'm a sucker for the pizza, also the prices are pretty reasonable and expect to have leftovers unless you've got a real A-game appetite  If you don't know the story behind Spinato's originally it was under the name Aurelio's which if you've ever been in the chicagoland area is a local family owned favorite throughout the state. and my personal favorite, and one of my \"we have to eat here\" places when I go home to visit.  Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name, but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato. the pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL, but it's damn close, damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell.  I'm almost a little sad that I didn't discover Spinato's up until last year. My wife has in the past even looked into getting mail order frozen pizza from Aurelios dry ice and absorbinent fees and all. and the closest thing I could find was deno's which was made in  the same style but the flavors were different.  fortunately they like to order this pizza at work and one day I tasted some pizza and was immediately reminded, I looked at the box did some googling and was amazed that they were here all along.  I hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, the signature mama is so yummy!  I love that they deliver to my home too!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite pizza places. My father in law used to eat here in Chicago and insisted we try it, we rarely go anywhere else now."}
{"text":"Got delivery, got a medium pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and bell peppers.  My friend brought one of their pies by the other day and I loved it so much, I decided I'd have to order myself and see if the delish-ness would be duplicated.  The delivery was timely, and the PIZZA!! It's like a NYC style pizza cut into the cool Chicago-style pieces (which I've always loved). The pizza was easily the size of a typical large pizza found elsewhere.  Oh, I also ordered extra sauce cause I remembered loving it when my friend brought over her pie.  ALL the toppings were generous and even with the extra sauce the crust was perfect.  Unfortunately for the fat-distribution on my already ample belly, I've now found another addictive pizza place."}
{"text":"We tried Spinato's Pizza for the first time on Friday, Sept. 4th for dinner. We selected Spinato's because my adult daughter has Celiac Disease and Spinato's has gluten free dishes on their menu.  We were greeted by the friendly hostesses and seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and he answered questions we had about entrees and pizzas on the menu. He was very knowledgeable. We were served our ice teas and soda's right away. Our order was placed and our food came out fresh and hot. My daughter and I had the gluten free garlic bread for an appetizer, she ordered the gluten free  10\" pizza called Nicole's New Favorite, I had the turkey PLT and my husband ordered the Italian beef sandwich. Everything was fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend this establishment if you would like to eat authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband, son, daughter and I had an early dinner Monday evening at Spinato's.  My daughter has Celiac Disease and Spinato's is one of the few restaurants that takes precautions in the kitchen--keeping her food from cross contamination.  We were greeted immediately upon walking in by the hostess whom was busy seating another couple; she told us she would be right with us.   While we were waiting, another couple came in and asked us if Spinato's is the \"best in Phoenix\"? My daughter and I replied: Yes they are. I explained about my daughter's Celiac Disease. I added that Spinato's is careful with her food and that they have gluten free options on their menu.   Upon being seated, I went to use the restroom. The restroom is very clean and tidy--this is important in restaurants we dine at--it speaks volumes about the restaurant itself. Our waiter Jordan arrived as my husband, son and I joined my daughter at the table.  He took our drink order and quickly returned with them to the table. I ordered an ice tea, my husband-water and my daughter and son had Pepsi. My tea was perfect--again it tells me that the staff knows how to make ice tea, as some places I have visited have either really watered down tea or its too strong. After giving us time to peruse the menu, Jordan took our order. My husband and I ordered off the happy hour menu Jordan had given us. We decided on the chicken wings-bone in, mild buffalo sauce and a small two item pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My daughter ordered the turkey pesto sandwich on gluten free bread. It comes with kettle chips and a crispy pickle. My son ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.  We didn't have to wait very long before the food arrived. The hot wings (6) half-dozen, were hot, fresh and delicious with just the right amount of sauce and spice to them. On the side were crispy carrots and celery. We had blue cheese to dip them in. Our pizza was fabulous as usual. Spinato's has a unique sauce that has a little bit of sweet to it-yummy. The pizza was crispy and good. My son's spaghetti with meat sauce arrived in a bowl with a nice slice of garlic bread. He enjoyed every bite of it. My daughter's turkey pesto sandwich was flavorful. The turkey was tender and moist.   Jordan was very attentive. He checked on us often and made sure everything was OK. He refilled our drinks and he cleared away our dishes. I think he should be recognized because he works really hard for his customer's. I want to return and ask for him so we can be seated in his area of the restaurant. I could tell he likes his job and cares about his customers.   After Jordan had already cashed out our bill, I decided to order the cannoli for dessert. It had cream and chocolate chips inside of it. It was crispy on the outside. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.   We will definitely be returning in the near future. We love Spinato's. They make you feel welcome and like family when dining there."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Love it! Love it!  Even on a Thursday it was busy. We had no trouble getting seated though. The pizza is crazy good. Draft beer prices are amazing and the service was good. I highly recommend the Strawberry Gorganzola salad. It will blow your mind man! The bread they use for their sandwiches has to be made in house or delivered daily because it is perfect. Slight buttery crunch on the outside and soft warm goodness on the inside. The last bite of my Italian sandwich was as good as the first (I can't believe I ate the whole thing)! Go! Eat! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Been here for 40 minutes and here is what happened in that time. Took over 10 minutes to get two waters. I ordered mine with lemon and had to ask twice for the lemon and it took a long time to get it even after the 2nd time. My husbands water was empty before she came back to take our order and she never re-filled it. I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to fill it. 25 minutes into the visit and the waitress informs us that she forgot to put our order in. She apologized so I forgave. About 5 min later she brought out some cheesy garlic bread. My husband and I weren't sure but thought that maybe she was just trying to repair some damage with a nice gesture. I had ordered a side Greek salad and a personal margarita pizza and my hubby ordered a small get meaty pizza. At the 40 minute mark anther server brought out a large sausage and pepperoni pizza to outer table. They were not at all busy and there were no guests that came in after us. There were only 3 tables including ours in the section where we sat.  When I told the server that the pizza wasn't ours she was very confused. I just told her we are gonna go ahead and leave."}
{"text":"So usually we love Spinato's the service is usually amazing and food is usually great but this time it failed to deliver and made me rethink going in the future. We have frequented this location maybe 10-15 times in the last four months which I think should tell you how much we enjoy going but this time the service was DREADFUL!!! The waiter was nice and attentive at first but then became slightly rude and distant once we ordered I was not finished with the pizza we had ordered and he grabbed my plate and said oh you are done let me get you a box and whenever we frequent Spinato's we order chocalate chip cookies to go because well we love them but the waiter didnt bother asking about anything extra and just flopped the bill down and walked away.  Also the pizza was not at it's usual quality, so all in all a bad experience and we will not be back right away."}
{"text":"YUM.  I've always loved Spinato's pizza like no other but now they've surpassed all my expectations with their gluten free pizza.  Simply amazing.  I was told to try a gluten free diet and I thought, why not, I'll give it a whirl.  Who new gluten free could taste BETTER than regular pizza dough.  Delicious! :D"}
{"text":"Yum. Signature Mama all the way. This is a great place, no matter how you slice it."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night. Service is always on point. I've been here with my husband a few times and never had a bad experience. We always order the garlic cheesy bread as an appetizer and share a medium sized pizza. Today we ordered half pepperoni with sausage half garlic, basil, and ricotta. The sauce is a bit on the sweet side but it doesn't bother me. The pizza comes on a thin crust which is very tasty. The atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxing. We will definitely keep coming back for our date nights. Thank you to Seth for taking care of us today!"}
{"text":"Simply whoa. This place is my new Italian restaurant. Everything tastes top notch and worth every penny! The pizza was one of the greatest ive ever had. And I LOVE pizza. My wife got the pasta, which I would never buy eating out, but it was really delicious. Definitely a go back for very soon."}
{"text":"I have had the first worst calzone that I've ever had in my life. It's a shame because growing up in my father's pizzeria I would expect a family owned monstrosity such as this to be a little bit better.  The calzone came out flat and sliced. I'm not sure which part of Italy these people learned their technique, but you do not slice a calzone, I don't care how big it is. To dumb down the eating experience so that people can have convenient pieces for them to grab and eat is not tha way to serve this dish. The sauce taste like it just came out of the can with no flavoring and or spices whatsoever. Where you would expect a nice gooey pile of stuffing, such as ricotta and cheese and meat and spinach, I actually had to open it up to make sure there was what I ordered was in it.  My wifes butternut cauliflower Pene was tasty  And Citra our server was pleasant, that why it got 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pizza is out of this world! Ordered it several times for the office and it has quickly become everyone's favorite! Only done take out so can't comment on the actual place but can say dealing with their employee's is easy, quick and they always get the order right. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place smells amazing when you walk in. Friendly hostess and was offered a drink whilst waiting for my friends. My chicken sandwich was tasty with the right amount of pesto. My friends gluten free pizza had a big hair in it. No big deal it can happen in any restaurant. The reason they get five stars is when we showed to to the server a manger was out on less than a minute. They offered to make another pizza a comped the pizza. Great pizza and service."}
{"text":"My first time to Spinados!! Amazing service, amazing pizza. This is my favorite pizza place!! We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer with vodka sauce. The best vodka sauce and meatballs ever.. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Always great friendly service when dining in or taking out. They specialize in thin crust pizzas and The Get Meaty is my favorite. The menu is extensive and you can do half and half specialty pies to keep things interesting. I really enjoy the family owned vibe. Highly recommend and I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I'd rather have had DiGiorno!......and I hate DiGiorno.  After reading the reviews I figured there was no way we wouldn't like it and the bad reviews were the usual complainers.  Let be clear in saying I rarely write a bad review but this one warranted one.  We both ordered the personal pan pizza and it was barely enough for my appetite but I didn't want to spend over 10 dollars on a pizza for myself.  The sauce was horrible!  It was sweet and my taste buds were confused.  The server admitted that its a particular taste and the taste was not for her lol.  Go figure that the employees don't even like the pizza.  I never had a pizza with a sauce that was that sweet.  It was very strange.  The people who rated this 5 stars must have no taste in food.....sorry.  My fiance at one tiny slice and walked out hungry.  I finished mine and thought to myself..what the heck am I eating.  The one thing I can say is that they comped her meal at least.  We didn't ask but they did."}
{"text":"Spinato's used to be better when they were at Glendale location now service sucks. They have hired many dreamers as servers who are clueless. And they favor smokers. When asked to tell some folks who were smoking within a few feet of the front door server said \"I always feel awkward asking them to move\" are you kidding it's the law Spinato's!!! Anyway they didn't care so I am in the process of becoming a thorn in their side. I have pictures of the violation. So I come prepared. I am in contact with the folks that have teeth in this type of matter.  Get over feeling awkward you wimps. Anyway now you have a headache on your hands. Game on Spinato's!!!! U may want to get the help of your smoker friends. Folks there are better options trust me. Former customer who was dissed and used to spend quite a bit of money there. No longer.  Do the same people."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite pizza place in Arizona, my husband and our family have been coming here for a long time and \"da Greek\" pizza is a must have. It is so good, the ambiance of the restaurant is so cool and the staff is always friendly. The salads are good, the spaghetti Is good I just love this place. The cannolis are amazing also! Go here and try it you will not regret it. It should be everyone's must stop pizza shop."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I usually prefer true deep dish Chicago style pizza, but Spinato's is great. The pizza is fresh, not greasy and tastes superb. Try the gelatos they taste great too."}
{"text":"Thinking about Spinato's triggers a Pavlovian response... I immediately start drooling.  The sweetness of their pizza sauce is like none other and the crispness and flavor of the crust can't be beat.  We've only eaten inside this location once because we prefer to get a pizza for takeout, but the salad we had while dining in was also amazing.  If you have a hankering for thin crust, there is no better pizza in the Valley!!"}
{"text":"The crust is consistently great. The pizza is always hot and fresh the wings are amazing"}
{"text":"Triple play! The staff, the food, and the drinks are all outstanding. The food is consistently excellent. The staff is friendly, helpful and they know what customer service means.   I sat at the bar one afternoon when they were practicing and training on some of the more exotic drinks. Quality is important to them.   Atmosphere is great! If you don't drink or dine here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"If you think dealing with a foreign tech support rep is frustrating DON'T try to phone in a order for pick up from this place. The experience will leave you with a yearning to throat punch someone. This was my third attempt. If the pizza was not so good I would not have tried after the first experience. The auto attendant is annoying and does not shut up while you wait the customary 5-10 mins. Eventually someone will answer and most likely put you on hold for another 5-10 mins, unless they inadvertently disconnect your call when they attempt to put you on hold. When that happens, and it did 2 out of three attempts you really have to ask yourself why a simple task has to be so difficult. It's a shame because I like the food and the only way to enjoy it without enduring BS is to go down to the restaurant in person."}
{"text":"Originally from out east, it is hard to find good pizza in AZ. Here at Spinatos I found it. The hostess Megan was very helpful and our server Cathy was delightful and informative. I will definitely be back!! Also save room for the cobbler, it is to die for."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza, a lot of pizzerias say they have authentic Chicago Pizza, Spinato's thin crust makes me stop missing my hometown pizza!"}
{"text":"Love love love love! Their pizza is to die for. We got Nicole's New Favorite which rocked. I would not change a thing about it. I like to sit in the bar area because there is no wait and the feel is more intimate. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Tried out some pizza at Spinato's this afternoon with some coworkers. Chose the \"thick crust\" Mama Spinato's pizza. Absolutely delicious is the only phrase I can really utter haha.  Spinach, garlic, and a sweet sauce covered my pizza in just the right amount. The crust was crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside (just the way I like it). Literally no burnt areas at all or undercooked sections.  Service was great (the servers kept asking us if everything was ok, always a nice touch). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer for years and they never fail to exceed my expectations. I've tried most of their signature pizzas and all of them are absolutely delicious. Even the veggie pies are so scrumptious you don't miss the meat.Last night I ordered a medium pizza with half \"Nicole's new favorite\" and half \"da Greek\". When I went to pick it up, 2 pizzas came out! The employee told me they forgot onions on the Greek half (which I wouldn't have even noticed), so they made me a new pie! Definitely way too much pizza for one girl, but I am so appreciative of that kind of customer service. Spinato's, you have a customer for life."}
{"text":"Spinatos is excellent pizza!  I know that Chris Bianco is the Phoenix pizza champion.  Spinatos is right behind him in taste and presentation.  They also have some pasta dishes and salads.  The outdoor space is off street and cozy.  Try 'Da Greek' pizza yum!  Dine in or take away it's great pizza"}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in the valley. Only thing that compares is oregonoes."}
{"text":"1/2 price wine Wednesdays.  Life is good!  Food here is AMAZING!  By far best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Spinatos Pizza is hands down one of the best Pizza I have ever eaten. Our family always order the large Hawaiian extra pineapple extra crispy. What makes their Pizza taste so good is the sauce. The sauce is perfect where it's not too sour and got a little bit of sweetness to it. This is our go to Pizza when we crave for pizza."}
{"text":"We have been going to the 12th Street/Glendale Spinatos for about 10 years -- since well before it was still a BYOB pizza joint years ago.  We were eager to share the new location with family visiting from Boston and Oakland, along with my elderly parents on the eve of my Dad's 81st birthday.  I know, you shouldn't go to a new restaurant in the first few weeks.  But this is Spinatos -- they have 5 restaurants with a hundred years of experience.  Surely they will open a restaurant right.  Right?  Wrong.  We were there the same night as RD above, the Friday after Thanksgiving.  This was a first week nightmare at the new Spinatos.    4:30 Called to alert them we had a group of 12 coming in an hour.  They don't take reservations yet, but was told it would not be a problem since they have lots of room.  5:30  We were told wait would be 20-25 mins.  Hmmm.  OK. Went to the bar with our 12 (7 adults/5 kids) and had a drink.   6:10 40 minutes in.  Hostess said it'll be just more 10 minutes.  Just waiting for a party to pay. Said we could go next door to order ahead to save time.  We did (turned out to be a bad move, b/c then we were \"pot committed\" to stay there....)  6:20:  50 minutes in.  Hostess again promised our table was almost ready.  I checked where she planned to put us and all the tables were occupied with new customers.  6:30:  1 hour in.  We finally got to speak with a manager.  He apologized profusely for their inept hostess staff that kept promising us tables that weren't there...Said it would be another 25 minutes.  7:00 90 minutes in.  Finally seated at a mishmash of different sized tables cobbled together in the back room.  Food that we had pre-ordered almost an hour before we were seated still took another 15 minutes to arrive.  Half our party had to leave as soon as the food got there.  We packed up the rest and left shortly afterwords.  EXTREMELY disappointing.    The kicker:  a table of 14 that got there AFTER us was seated BEFORE us.   \"Why?\" I asked.  \"Well, they called ahead\" I was told.  Are you kidding me -- so did I, and you don't take reservations.  In the end, the manager's discounted our meal, and I tipped the servers well -- it wasn't their fault.  But mere money can't make up for a truly lousy experience -- on what was to be a big, happy, stress-free family dinner.  Spinatos:  Train your people to tell the truth and deal with mistakes quickly and honestly.  To paraphrase the Dread Pirate Roberts/Westley, \"We are people of action; lies do not become us.\""}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Hour to get our food after watching people come in-eat-and go...  Lame"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the valley! Great GF pizza options! They also serve their GF pizza with a a red  & white checker board paper just to verify its GF! They also serve Omission beer! Their antipasto salad is a MUST. I am here EVERY week and crave it until I return!"}
{"text":"Went in around the beginning of September, place was crowded and loud. Food was just ok, can't compare it to the best in Tukee, which is Florencia. We waited 45 minutes for our pizza before my husband went to get the manager. Woo hoo - given free dessert. Lame. This is one to skip."}
{"text":"Oh the flavor!! Mama Spinatos's Spinach pizza is the best! But if you don't like garlic it is not the pizza for you. Order the Get Meaty instead."}
{"text":"Just got done eating lunch here. Not my first time either! The pizza, the sandwhiches... the salads! There is nothing bad here! They greet you happily at the entrance and the service is nice. If you are lucky enough to get Adam as your server you will want for nothing. On a side note my mom wants me to post that Da Greek pizza is the best evah! Today I went for the veggie sandwhich with a side salad. They bake it on ciabatta bread. It is hands down one of the best veggie sandwhiches I have tried. I read where they have mutiple locations around the Phx area. Find yours and go! (FYI they also have daily meal and different wine deals)."}
{"text":"We are nothing but amazed and happy to find this pizza place so close to us!!!  so flavorful and tasty , crunchy  thin crust !!! great service , always packed so you have to be patient and have a nice craft beer pint while you wait.  take out also works and the pizza stays good cause they have a great packaging ."}
{"text":"I've been a little disappointed with Spinato's the last few times we've gone for Happy Hour.   It's important for people to know that they've changed that menu and taken off a lot of their customer's favorites. Disappointing, for sure. But the service has declined a bit.   I appreciate that their servers jump in and help one another, but because they do that, we never know who our actual server is. It's kind of hard to gauge the tip when you've seen so many faces! I hope they bring back the Spinato's it used to be, because I really miss the pizza. It was once well worth the drive out there."}
{"text":"After my last experience, I think I'm gonna have to delete Spinato's from my go-to pizza spot. I've frequented this place multiple times, maybe once a week even and I always seem to look past the bad service and just visit for the taste of the pizza alone because well, it was just that good!  After a long week, my bf and I along with his parents went over for happy hour/dinner tonight. We were seated at a booth and the server was nice.  I ordered the usual - gluten free combo with jalapenos along with HH wings.    We received our order of wings first.  The wings were being devoured and we were emptying our plates. As the server starts picking up the empty plates to make way for the pizza, he slips and the plates come crashing on our table.  Ranch and pizza sauce splatters everywhere including on our clothes!  My bf had ranch all over his pants and shirt. It was the most awkward moment!  We all fell silent, the server is apologizing profusely, and a few employees come by giving us napkins and club soda.  Why, thanks! The pizza gets to our table and the table is still messy with ranch sauce. The accident happened so fast and I felt like the employees just dropped things to help us clean up, but they didn't clean up the table for us!  We were wiping the table down ourselves.   We start eating our pizzas and things seem to simmer down. Then, here comes the aftermath. My bf's dad starts drinking his water and there is a chicken wing bone in his cup! Oh nasty. Then to make things worse, the mgr (I think) came over and said if I wanted, I can get my shirt drycleaned and they would reimburse me so she gave me a business card that was written, \"Good for drycleaning of one shirt\". My, that was a nice gesture (saying sarcastically).  That would mean that I would have to drive to a drycleaner to drop off my shirt, then pick it up, then go over to Spinato's to get reimbursed for $2!  The gas alone to get to and from the drycleaners and to head to Spinato's would be more than $2! Are you kidding?!  Thanks for inconveniencing me for reimbursement!  Nothing on our check was comp'd. As an \"exceptional service\" practice, comping a dinner for a restaurant's mistake/accident and the inconvenience of even going to a drycleaner would have been the best thing to do.   I used to love the pizza, but now - I just don't want to consider even coming back."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have passed this place dozens of times.  We finally gave it a try recently and I was very impressed.  We decided to order:  Garlic Bread (6 pieces), $5.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=X0elBleeHqR4TYo8otADEA#X0elBleeHqR4TYo8otADEA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=hYufDU5eRviC5i7Kmk-4uA#hYufDU5eRviC5i7Kmk-4uA  Large Pizza 16\" (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami), $19.90 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=ajmKmCG0ZEyQm8E1DVfcxw#ajmKmCG0ZEyQm8E1DVfcxw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=ZbAM6NvzetKt1ntc0PC7XQ#ZbAM6NvzetKt1ntc0PC7XQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=bauCN8FYXeUAzk1XEI-HZg#bauCN8FYXeUAzk1XEI-HZg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinatos-pizza-scottsdale?select=Ue2XLtSK9A3Yq1Ru7ZwgZA#Ue2XLtSK9A3Yq1Ru7ZwgZA  The Garlic Bread was pretty good and a nice sized portion.  It's light and fluffy, like a dinner roll.  The Pizza is a Chicago style thin Crust with a slightly sweet flavored Sauce.  We ordered it well done, and it came out perfect.  It's a legit Chicago style Pizza...the Pizza reminds me of a place called Fox's Restaurant and Pub in Beverly.  Very good indeed!  The servers here are very friendly and provided great service during our visit.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, it's hard to find good pizza..until Spinato's came to town! Been there about 10 times now and it's consistently YUMMY! The sauce has a slight sweetness to it, and the pizza...fuhgettaboutit!! Good service, they always get the order right.  Just ask for the pizza to be crispy as the dough could be a little mushy if you don't ask for it be crispy.  Must have!!"}
{"text":"When I entered the restaurant I automatically knew I wanted to come back for a second time! The patio & bar area are so nice and appealing that all you want to do is relax and have a glass of wine with your family and friends. I would skip the pizza though, the sauce is on the sweeter side and I was not a big fan of that. The wings were perfect although beware the hot flavor is REALLY HOT I could only eat one and normally I have a high tolerance for spicy food. The reason I am giving a lower rating is because I did not like the pizza very much and that was the main thing I ordered. Therefore, I would totally come back to try a pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The spaghetti calzone is awesome. Very friendly staff and a great bar. Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our first time last night. The service was quick and friendly. the restaurant was very small.  there is Iimited outdoor seating on the patio. if you order ahead you pick up on the right hand side of the front entrance. if you want to dine in you eat you enter on the left hand side of the entrance.  we were seated directly in view of the kitchen which did make for a very loud evening.  pizza was just okay.  there is a sweet taste to the sauce which I did not care for. Total bill was just over $27 for a large thin 2 topping pizza and 2 pop."}
{"text":"I discovered Spinatos at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival this year. Tonight the hubby had a pizza craving and lo and behold, this Spinatos is pretty close to us.  We ordered Mamma's special or favorite (I forget the exact name - the one with fresh spinach). It was delicious! I loved the thin crust and sweet sauce. Pizza was not greasy and was well seasoned. Probably one of the best pizzas I've had in the valley.  Service was friendly. A small gripe I have is that our food took very long to come out. A very long time. Before I got the chance to mention it, our server took the initiative to tell us that our food was taking longer than usual because a large party's order was backing up the kitchen. I appreciated that he explained and apologized, but he could have offered us some bread or crackers or some fruit or something. My 3 and 5 year olds were hungry and getting antsy. I had to ask for something (bread) to hold them over and he acted like he was going to charge us for it, which I thought was ridiculous.  As soon as he walked away, someone brought our food out, so I waived our server down to cancel the bread order. You would think he would have comp'd us something because we had to wait an unreasonably long time for our food. Still, he was friendly and attentive, albeit a little clueless.  I'll give this place another chance. The food was great (once we got it). Very family friendly too."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!!  Sweet sauce is delicious.  Agree with other reviews that takeout service can be problematic.  We often call in to go orders.  Many times we arrive at the designated time only to have to wait for our pizzas to be ready.  But, it is worth it.  Their pizza is the best in the valley.  I recently tried the ravioli with vodka sauce and it was also wonderful.  My sons are crazy for the spaghetti calzones, and my husband is a fan of the Italian sausage sandwich.  Very crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings, so be prepared.  Also, a little pricey for pizza, but you get what you pay for.  One last note - they do offer a gluten free pizza.  My daughter used to LOVE their GF pizza when the crust was from GF Creations, but they recently switched to a new crust and it is just okay - not any better than a frozen GF pizza from the grocery store."}
{"text":"On our way cross town. Yelp says Spinattis is great. We stopped for pizza and Yelp was right. Enjoyed the cool patio even tho temp is over 90. Also our service was fantastic. We prefer thin crust. This was perfect thin crust. Not wimpy and limp like some. Good there are other ones in the valley too. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is such a great date spot!  I love everything about their pizza and fresh toppings! This place has become 1 of my favorite pizza places nearby.   The only reason I give this a 4 star review is because the Golden BBQ Wings are just awful!...If you love mustard, than these wings are for you.  I expected it to be more of a honey BBQ flavor, but boy was I wrong! They should either rethink their sauce recipe or perhaps rename the wing.  It's too bad I got these ToGo or I would have returned them after the first bite."}
{"text":"Was looking for the best places to eat pizza in Scottsdale and this popped up as number 3 on the Yelp list. It did not disappoint. In fact, it was so good I couldn't stop eating it! Love that they cut the pizza in little squares, makes it go down even easier haha  We ordered The Spicy Italian, The Combo and The Margherita for take-away. My favorite was The Combo (Italian sausage, mushrooms, mixed green & red sweet bell peppers, mozzarella) but honestly they were all really good.  I really appreciate that they use the true Italian sausage with fennel and that slightly sweet sauce is the icing on the cake! Will for sure be back. I think we found our new \"go-to\" pizza place in Scottsdale. :-D"}
{"text":"this is By Far the worst pizza place in Chandler, it is greasy and the service sucks, they don't even wait for you to finish to take your plate, and you have to remind them to give you the bill, if I could I give -1 star, the pizza cutting sucks they cut squares out of a circle, how come you haven't learned how to cut a pizza in the US??  plus it is overpriced, for a pizza like that quality I can get the 5 dollar deals in other places, first and last time I go there, Grimaldi's is waaay better, even dominos is better"}
{"text":"We tried to find a good pizza place and we did! Everything here was great! Decent happy hour prices, phenomenal specialty pizzas, and pretty good appetizers. Atmosphere is a bit dressy but prices are pretty average. We will be back for sure to try some more of the specialty pizzas!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix. So far this is my favorite pizza place so far. I got the thin crust pepperoni and salami and it's pretty amazing. Matter a fact it's utterly awesome. Their pizza sauce is like the perfect pizza sauce and when it's on that thin crust it comes together very well. I also love their cheese and the amount they use. Major plus the pizza came out really fast so if ur in a hurry this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town that I know of. The salads are excellent as well. And every mployee we have met there has treated us like gold."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza and some of the cheese garlic bread, and had it delivered. The thin crust is not truly a thin crust to this Midwesterner, but the pizza was good. The tomato sauce was rich and nicely seasoned. No complaints on the delivery time, took about 25 minutes over the noon  hour when ordered on a Thursday. They don't have a wide variety of drinks for ordering- just Pepsi, diet, Sierra Mist and Mtn Dew. Maybe common here?"}
{"text":"Nice place for a work luncheon.  The pizzas and salads are pretty good and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"The super six is amazing! Sign up for the email club and you get $10 off on your birthday plus occasional discounts for different holidays."}
{"text":"WARNING: the marinara sauce is WAY too sweet. Completely ruined the experience. I get that the secrecy to a lot of sauces and even crust is a sweet component but this is too much. I asked for well done and it wasn't close but that's just bad on the kitchen tonight. The basil was fresh and the cheese was nice and gooey. The pepperoni was typical and greasy. I cheated on Grimaldi's and suffered. I hardly ever give a one star but the sauce earned it."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Thin crust with lots of toppings. I like that the waitress advertised the beer special without me having to ask. I'll be back."}
{"text":"staff is very brusk and unpleasant.... liked it better when they were a smaller location and cared more about their customers.... not to mention the inconvenient sunday hours at eight..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a teen. Decided to go to the newest location and wow its so big! Food was just as good as always. I took a friend for the first time who was equally impressed. Prices are great for quality and amount you get. Also excited this location has a new take and bake side which is great! Will continue to eat hear."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but somewhere along the way their pizza stopped tasting as good. Every time we got it the pizza would be a greasy mess and the ingredients would just taste cheap."}
{"text":"We got the signature pizza which consists of fresh spinach, tomatoes, and garlic and it was fantastic.  the sauce was flavorful, the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered, during the NBA playoffs, and it arrived in about 35 minutes, right at half time; so timing was perfect!!  It showed up hot and delicious which says a lot about their delivery service.  Well done, I def recommend to others."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch.  Not busy at all.  Food and service was excellent!  We ordered the bruschetta for our appetizer, one of the best in my book!  For main course, we split the Italian beef sandwich with au jus and a small 7\" pizza with pepperoni with banana peppers and onions.  The sandwich do die for!  We added provolone cheese but in all honesty I could've eaten it plain.  The beef was perfectly cooked and sliced super thin the way it should be!  The pizza was cooked perfectly as well, it tasted like homemade pizza with the freshest ingredients.  I can't say anything bad about this place except there's not a location close to my house.  Even the napkins were great!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at Spinato's in their original location. My first visit to the new location was lunch midweek; we were seated in less than 5 minutes despite a busy crowd. Service was excellent, appetizers came fast, and pizza was hot, fresh, and delicious. Recommend this pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"I was there tonight and I went in and I had to standup there was nobody at the hostess booth then I sat down and still nobody helped me so I told the bartender to get the manager and I walked out, The manager seems sincere and he explained to me that he's going to talk to the staff but my son works at a pizza place and  is a host If somebody sitting there on the bench or table you always want to ask him have you been helped that's the magic word of a long-time customer at spinatos but not anymore I want to another place 20 minutes later good service and excellent pizza, You lost my service my girlfriend service and my sons service believe me!!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing, and really well priced, I love their calzones! Their beer and wine selection is ok, though they have had a tendency of be out of their seasonal specialty wine when I've asked. They have indoor and outdoor seating, and great service. I love very close to here and out of all the restaurants around this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"I had my very first date with my boyfriend of 2 years here and we recently revisited the restaurant and couldn't be more pleased with the friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great 1st time at Spinato's!!!  We went late on a Tuesday night and it was like we had the whole place to ourselves.   Beautiful, clean & organized restaurant with a very nice staff.  The food is absolutely amazing, we loved the MEATY pizza, baked to perfection! I was mad I forgot to bring the leftovers to work for lunch the next day!  Highly recommend this place and look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this establishment.  Family owned and operated.  The Owner visits each table to welcome and thank for eating at the establishment.  From my understanding there are five locations and every evening he visits one.  Kristen was our server to start and gave great service and recommendations.  We ordered the meatball trio it was very delicious cheesy garlic bread and personal pizzas with our choice of toppings. Everything was super fresh and flavorful.  Our server change to Cole who just happened to be the owners grandson working his way through college and my i add he is a senior now. He was very nice and knowledgeable.  If you are in Phoenix you won't be disappointed this is authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Remarkably flavorless salad (the antipasto). Amazing pizza, however. We sat at a table that shared a wall with the dishwashing station and it sounded like there was an MMA cage fight going on behind the wall and in the ceiling space overhead. It was slightly jarring each time a dish bin was violently thrown on a counter. If you are going there for pizza, you will probably be very satisfied. They also serve Pepsi products, not Coke :("}
{"text":"New favorite pizza place in town!  As a cubby kid I like good pizza with all the bad stuff on it. And they know how I like it! Btw the cookies are yum too! I ordered by phone and picked up so this review is solely based on TAKE OUT.  The wait was a bit long when I got there but worth it! It's a popular place so a little wait isn't that big of a deal, esp. When it's good and a fair price! And don't the cookies."}
{"text":"This is a great place that's honestly, REALLY tucked away in Chandler. Even though it's off of Chandler Blvd...it's the opposite direction of a crowd. It's a few miles from the Chandler Fashion Square Mall, which why you won't find a SUPER packed restaurant. That's a rare gem if you ask me, especially on a weekend night.    There was not a wait, which was super suprising! I'm used to an Oreganos-like wait in order to get decent pizza or pasta. Everything seems to be advertised as homemade. It honestly tasted like it too. I got the sixth topping (forgot what it's called, something six) pizza. It was delicious.  It was paritucliary sweet. Not sure if all of pizza sauce is that sweet. Wasn't bad st all though. My gf got the turkey and pesto sandwich (I think), and that also was great. The bread was the  best part, and it didn't fill you up with calories either.   It was great pricing. The literal only the thing that could have been better...was the waiter. He was a bit awkward - not to throw anyone under the bus! I'll still be back, and could rate this place 5 stars afterwards..."}
{"text":"By far our favorite pizza in the valley!! Both my husband and I are from Chicago, and before Lou's, this was our only go to place. The thin crust is awesome. The sauce has the perfect amount of sweetness, and the specialty pizzas are unique and delicious. We go back again and again and are NEVER disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is just alright. The one thing that prevents us from going back is the fact that the pizza sauce is SO sweet. Once we were getting a subway and the guy making our sandwich told us that he worked there, and they put apple juice in their sauce to make it sweet. I don't know if that's true or not, but it certainly tastes like that can be true. My parents love it here and love the sweet sauce. I just don't like it very much."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place for a really long time. But honestly, I was not impressed. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The red sauce is also kinda sweet. But it was okay."}
{"text":"Above average, for us at least! We'd heard about them on PBS loooong time ago and I've had them on my Must Try list forever. Finally got down there. It was a Tuesday about 4:30ish. Pretty dead,  honestly. I would assume everyone is recovering from their 4th of July and laying low at home.   So, we didn't know it was happy hour, that was a nice surprise! There's a few pizzas that are on special, and there are drink specials and a few appetizer specials.  Hubby wanted the cheese bread (despite my trying to talk him into the meatballs) and it was better than expected for $3 bucks. The bread was a PERFECT blend of soft, but toasted, chewy crunchy deliciousness topped with a quality mozzarella, perfectly melted and sprinkled with Italian herbs. The marinara was sweet, which we weren't complaining about! You need sweet to cut the acidity in the tomatoes.   On to pizza. Hubs got the Canadian, which is pineapple and Canadian bacon. It was very good, although for some reason his crust wasn't as crispy as mine-not bad at all, just an observation. I think the flavors in the crust and sauce are pretty darn good. POSSIBLY too much sauce on the Canadian pineapple one... Only because the pineapple is sweet, then the sauce is sweet, I think it was literally just a hair oversweet. Just a hair! Still very very good!  I was feeling adventurous! So I tried the special, the sausage and fennel with balsamic glaze. DYNAMITE. sometimes you just get a menu item that is PERFECTLY balanced with several real strong flavors put together, and it works. The glaze really just finished it off with the bow-chicka-bow-wow factor. And my pizza was crisp, the slices did not bend when picked up. Come to think of it, there's no red sauce on that one... Which is probably why it was much more crisp. Perhaps we'll ask for light sauce next time we order the Canadian.  GO. EAT. BE HAPPY."}
{"text":"Umm I love this place!! The atmosphere, proxies, and above all else the food!! Wow my family & I stopped here for lunch before going shopping and I'm so glad we did. We will be long-time reoccurring customers for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I've had way better pizza personally.  Actually, Papa Murphy's take and bake spicy sausage and fennel pizza blows the version this place serves out of the water for the price."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service over the phone. They will up charge you if they can.... they tried to charge me more because I substituted one ingredient. Claimed they would build the pizza (which cost more) instead of substituting one ingredient at the speciality pizza rate (which is cheeper). When I quested terry (the guy taking the order), he argued with me says they don't substitute on speciality pizzas, which they did the only other time I've eaten here.  Think twice about this establishment they have terrible customer service, and they will up charge and argue with you..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the state. Thin crust pizza The sauce is great Always have had excellent service."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza yummmm yummy;))) I couldn't eat pizza in another place,,,,, sooooo goood pizza iever eaten"}
{"text":"Agree with previous poster, Stephanie M. I came here for the pizza, but I didn't care for it too much. The sauce was sweet and seemed pasty.  I ordered a personal cheese pizza. On the positive, the service was great and the personal size (added picture) is just right for one small person/someone not super hungry.  Based on the reviews, I would likely give it another try but would get something besides the pizza."}
{"text":"I love their pizzas, the best in Scottsdale! I'm not pizza person, but when my sister in law introduced me to this place, I fell in love with their pizza since.  The spinach & strawberry salad was delicious as well. I will definitely comeback to this place and try more pizzas...."}
{"text":"1st time going there tonight. Have lived in the area for 5 years. Great dinner, great service by Megan and Cathy.  Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Spinato's was our go to pizza place every Tuesday night. We left AZ in 2014. Came for a visit in Sept 2016. Outstanding pizza. Yup we're moving back and looking forward to Spinato's"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of the North Valley. THE PIZZA IS FANTASTIC - this is coming from a Chicago pizza snob, and yes, real Chicago Pizza is tavern, NOT deep dish. This is thin crust with a sweet sauce, unlike any I've ever had. I wish I lived closer, I'd be a regular. Great staff. TIP: Line out the door at peak times, for good reason, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza I have had in Phoenix, love the thin crust pizza here as well as the caprese salad.  Quick service, like the outdoor seating, even if it is a little crowded."}
{"text":"Last Saturday we had Spinato's cater our mothers 80th birthday party at this location and I wanted to write in to say what an WONDERFUL job that they did. 30 family members  and friends from 3 States attended and everyone had commented on what a great time they had.   The food was as delicious as always but  I really wanted to acknowledge the great service that we received from the crew,  Todd and Brandon (the men in charge of catering) the hostess ( regretfully I have forgotten her name) and Matt were very friendly and professional.  A special Thank you goes to our server Bobby, he was incredible, he took care of 30 people and stayed on top of everything with a friendly smile and a great personality. He really made this occasion perfect.  I highly recommend Spinato's if you want to have an exceptional experience. They treated us all like we were their family. Make sure that you request Bobby to provide the perfect service for your special event."}
{"text":"It's been awhile but still excellent, Nick our server was very nice . Had steak calzone good , 11 inch super six for $9 during happy hour can't go wrong , also had the combo pizza and a Chicago to take home, the location in Phoenix is a little nicer but we came for the pizza , forgot we had the capresse $9 a little much for that but it was good . If you guys want to open another don't forget us in the West valley(Avondale). Again thanks Nick and Spinatos."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza!  Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians!  Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza!  Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians!  Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza! Great pizza!  Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place, especially if you love Frank Sinatra! His music is often playing overhead and I love it!    The sauce they make has a bit of a sweet flavor to it, but it works! They also make their own italian sausage and it's wonderful. The ravioli is quite tasty and the thin crust pizza with spinach, sausage, garlic and mushrooms is to die for!  I'm a true pizza snob because I generally only like Deep dish, Chicago Style Pizza from The Windy City, but this is a pleasant place for pizza!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the pizza which was tasty. My friend's who ordered a sandwich said, \"You would never know this sandwich was on gluten-free bread!\" The only downfall on our visit is that they were out of the IPA on the menu - such a bummer when you want a good beer with your pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pizza. They make their own sauce and the quality/taste is out of this world. As others have said, they really deserve 10 stars."}
{"text":"We love Spinato's!!!  We go whenever our family comes to visit from Illinois!  We went tonight and has the best service ever!  Keiko was wonderful and gave us the perfect amount of attention. Food was GREAT as usual!!!  It's definitely worth the drive!  (Still waiting for a Spinato's in the NW valley!!!!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten gluten free pizza before but loved it here.  Excellent pizza, great family-style salads, attentive service, quick and easy.   I look forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Super sweet pizza sauce.  Definitely loaded with sugar. If you do not like a sweet sauce I would definitely avoid this place. As for the rest of the ingredients they are of a fine quality.  I myself prefer a more robust, spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite food is pizza. I would eat it 5 nights a week if my husband would let me. This is the best pizza place we have visited in the valley (trust me I have tried almost all of them). The staff is friendly and the pizza is always spot on. If you love crispy pizza ask for the double extra crispy crust. It only adds a few more minutes on the wait time but is worth it.  Every time we have visitors we always bring them here and everyone always loves it."}
{"text":"First time here brought my girl heard good things of this pizza.. we sit down and look at the menu and the server tells us what makers their pizza stand out the sweet sauce.. I'm kinda of scared to get a pizza at that moment then the table behind us says the pizza was horrible and then we get really scared so we order the smallest pizza. The Chicago pizza which has sausage red onions and also order a Greek salad. Gotta say the pizza was pretty good! Glad we tried something new!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Spinato's ever since I tried their restaurant location in Ahwatukee.  The crust is always perfectly cooked and very thin, so it's nice & crispy.  The service has been consistently great.  Tonight, I tried one of their cocktails, Sriracha Mary (basically a bloody mary with more kick & flavor) and it was garnished with pepperoni slices, pimento olive and cherry tomato.  It was a well balanced drink and I'm glad I tried it.  For dinner, we started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which is always a nice start.  The cheese is creamy and flavored well.  Then we had the Apple & Pecan salad, which is just right.  The tartness from the green apples & cranberries blends well with the bitter mix of field greens.  And for our pizza, we tried the Super Six combo and added Fresh garlic and feta cheese, a complete masterpiece full of flavor.  The only problem I had was the lighting in the bar area, it was a bit dark and took a minute to adjust my eyes to review the menu.  If you ever get a chance, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My guess is that the pizza is much better when you needed there then take it out.  Hi live only next-door in one of the communities. By the time I got the pizza home it was soggy and not good to eat  So my suggestion would be that you eat in. The taste of the pizza was very good  But the pizza is very overpriced. It is double that of Papa John's Domino's or others. Personally I don't think it was worth the double price.  I did not try any of the other food. But while I was sitting and waiting to take my pizza home I saw other dishes. Presentation is average and typical pizza restaurant food.  I give it three stars because it is very expensive for average pizza"}
{"text":"I read a Yelp review about this restaurant in Tempe and I really wanted to try it.  We happened to be starving and driving by the Phoenix location, so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived around 2:30 pm for a late lunch/early dinner.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  Our waiter was very attentive and good about refills.  We noticed that there was a happy hour for drinks and apps, so we got the cheesy garlic bread and dipping sauce.  Amazing and tasty!  I went with a calzone, which was reasonably priced and small (the waiter warned me), but it was the perfect size and I even brought half home for later.  This was fresh and delicious.  My husband enjoyed his chicken parm and ate every last bite.  We are from NY, so we are usually picky about Italian food, but we really enjoyed our meals.  I don't know if we will have a chance to come back, but I recommend this place.  We ordered 1 beer, 1 appetizer, personal sized calzone and chicken parm, total with tax was $27.  Fairly reasonable IMO."}
{"text":"It is the first time here. We ordered chicken presto pesto it was fabulous. Now it became favorite pizza place for me."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the City!  Real Authentic Italian pizza, not a bland rip off like most places or some lame \"gourmet\" attempt with Frog Legs and Sweet potato. Don't believe me, try it and find out."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident when someone brought in some pizza for lunch. Wow just had to go check it out for myself.  Walked into the take out section placed an order and they gave me a free fountain drink while I waited.  Very clean, friendly and attentive to customer service.   And oh yeah the reason I came in is that their pizza rocks!  Had the thin crust pep and Italian sausage. Amazing!  Yummy!  Just found a new fav!!!"}
{"text":"We had been referred to Spinato's by multiple friends over the last few months but hadn't made it over this way until now. It did not disappoint. The wait was about thirty minutes on a Friday night at 6:00pm but that was to be expected. We were seated in about 25 minutes.   My fiancé and I had heard rave reviews about the Mamma Spinato's Spinach Pizza beforehand so it was between this or a create your own. We settled on the Mamma Spinato's to try something different. It consisted of a thin crust with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella and I ordered half with jalapenos for a bit of a kick. It was fantastic! Great flavor. It was a little heavy on the spinach but it did not over power the pizza completely. The sauce here is fantastic and I would like to now try other flavors of pizza for comparison. We also had some hot boneless buffalo wings with ranch which were pretty good, not great but good.   I had ordered a \"Snakebite\" drink from the bar menu. It was a nitro milk dark beer combined with Crispin hard cider. It was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this. I am a dark brew kind of girl and this really hit the spot. It was the perfect combination of bitter and sweet. Really good. Also very good selection of beer on tap.  Overall very good experience. Service was a little slow but they were busy and I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner, just the two of us.  We arrived and were told it was going to be a 25 min wait, which on a Saturday night that was expected.  We sat at the bar and started to order a couple classes of wine from the bar tender Edward but they had just texted us for our table.  There was only a 5 minute wait, awesome! We were seated in the bar, where there were no children, awesome! We each had a pasta dish Chicago Penne Alla Vodka and Rosted Butternut squash & Brussels sprout penne, with cheesy garlic bread.  Glasses of wine for $5, awesome! Christopher ordered the tempting Red Velvet Ding Dong, it is exactly what you think. It is a square, not round, Red Velvet cake dipped in dark chocolate.  Holy crap it was good. I for one do not order dessert at restaurants unless they appear exception to me. I am often disappointed.  In this case my compliments to the pastry Chef, this cake was super moist and tasty without being too sweet.  I ordered the Trios Cabernet Sauvignon, which was super tasty.  Pops had the Chianti. The service was great and we simply enjoyed a great meal. As a bit of recommendation, if you have not eaten at Spinato's before you must give it a try. The sauce is has great flavor, the Pizzas are great and so is the pasta. If you have not been to the original locale in Tempe you should see where it all started. It is in an industrial area and they do not serve alcohol at this location. It opened in 1986. The Central or North Central Phoenix location opened in 1994, has since moved from the well know 12th St and Glendale location to the new building built where Manuel's Mexican food once stood, at the corner of 7th St. & Missouri. It is in my opinion a far better location. The new building is beautiful. It has increased the size of the restaurant and the parking is much better.  However, I do like the intimacy of the old location. As a local, it made me feel like it was my restaurant and not just another commercial space.  Spinato's has great pizza, pasta, salads, and appetizers. They still serve up authentic Chicago style Italian food even though they have been making pizza in the valley since 1974."}
{"text":"Great place!  We were recommended this place by a coworker, so we thought we'd give it a whirl. The owner, Ken has really created a gem. We had the Greek salad, mozzarella garlic bread, Chicago penne al a vodka substituted with Bolognese, and sausage Florentine with chicken instead of sausage. What a treat! The substitutions we ordered we easily handled with the  kitchen.  I would recommend this place to everyone! We'll be back for sure. The reason for the four star is the crostini served with each entre. It was extremely bland and oily. I know they are the 'thing' right now, but, flavor, please. Other than that... awesome!"}
{"text":"We had an okay experience here. The drinks were different. Not good, not bad. The food was fine, except for dessert. We ordered the brownie which tasted like they just thawed it for fifteen seconds in the microwave. Not fresh. I won't be coming back on my own accord."}
{"text":"Spinato's is my favorite pizza place in all of Phoenix.  The pizza is simply incredible!  The customer service is great too.  For example, for my birthday I had a party and invited some friends.  My birthday is July 5th, and Independence day was on Friday.  I had spoken to the manager previously, and she said that because I was ordering a number of pizzas that I should order them a day ahead of time.  I tried to call on July 4th, but the restaurant was closed.  I was in a bit of a panic, as I had already hyped up the pizza to my guests.  On the morning of my birthday, I went to the restaurant itself.  I knocked on the door a full half-hour before the restaurant was set to open.  I talked to a wonderful employee by the name of Gabby and explained the situation.  She let me in and took the order and promised that the pizzas would be delivered by 5:00 p.m.  There was not one hint of irritation, and I never felt like I was being a bother (although I probably was).  I went away feeling like my birthday had been saved.  At 5:00 almost to the minute, the pizzas arrived.  The delivery person was polite and friendly, and my guests loved the pizza.  I can't say enough great things about this place.  I highly recommend it.  I'm not sure what's going on with other reviews on here that say the service is horrible because I certainly didn't see that, and I never have any time I've been there."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky about sauce and usually opt for a olive oil sauce at most restaurants but I decided to give it a go here from the raving reviews of their sauce, and wow! It was delicious and the only pizza place I get sauce added on. The crust is cooked perfectly. My favorite item would have to be the spaghetti calzone- I get it with the vodka sauce & the meatballs added in. So delicious and always a good way to end a long day! It's my go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"New to the area & coworker mentioned Spinatos.  Had good reviews so gave it a try.  So glad I did! Called in my order (again, glad I did) it was busy.  Even their phone line was busy for 10 minutes.  Ordered the chicken pesto pizza....,one word- AMAZING! Price was reasonable. Got the 11\" perfect for 2 people. I was quoted about 30 minutes and it was ready when I got there.  Will definately go back to try the other delicious looking pizzas."}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizza joint/delivery in Phoenix, but expect delivery on weekend evenings to take 60-75 minutes.  Great flippin' pizza though."}
{"text":"This is really great pizza. Easy delivery and a great wait staff in the store.   Fresh ingredients and really nice people."}
{"text":"Hands down the best spaghetti calzone ever! And there pizza is absolutely amazing. The place could use a make over though"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza!  I ate the thin crust cheese with meatball.  And they deliver. Thank you."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Wrigley sandwich. Beef and Sausage Combo asked for AU JUS instead of marinara. Kids all like their meals.  Meatballs were very good."}
{"text":"Nothing new here - except to say the pizza was awesome. I'm a late convert to Spinato's - a neighbor told us of the gluten-free crusts they offer (courtesy of www.glutenfreecreations.com).  I eat regular crust but some in my family are wheat sensitive, so we hit Spinato's for their GF pizza. The wheat sensitive ones loved the gluten free pizza and this wheat eater loved the regular pizza.   If you love excellent pizza, hit Spinato's.  http://www.spinatospizza.com/"}
{"text":"I love Spinatos pizza. But their house wine is terrible. I would rather drink 3 buck Chuck. Get a new house wine! It reflects badly to have a house wine that is undrinkable."}
{"text":"Wow, I must be in the twilight zone.  I visit this Spinatos location regularly, for years. It has always been my favorite in Phoenix.  But this time I had my first bad experience.  It started out seating. It was a cool evening and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for inside seating.  No problem, except that there was a half dozen empty tables in the dining room. Yet, immediate seating outside? A table is a table?  Then the wine. We order the house wine which is usually pretty decent. Tonight it was terrible. Bad bottle or have they changed brands?  Next came our salads which were pathetic. A bowl of croutons with dressing.   Finally our pizza. Looked great, loaded with toppings, nicely cooked. But totally lacking in flavor. What?  Something has changed. It is as if the sauce had no taste.  I am hoping that this was an anomaly. That things will be back to normal next visit. It would be a terrible disappointment if they have changed the recipes that made this place great."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Pizza just like I remember back home in Illinois!!! Love it! Best ive had in AZ!"}
{"text":"I am constantly looking for the best Chicago thin crust pizza. The pictures and reviews drew me in to Spinatos. The salad and garlic bread was wonderful, but I didn't care for the pizza though. Spinatos has a very unique pizza sauce and it is quite sweet. My husband liked it and said it reminded him of a BBQ pizza. I didn't like it. Darn it!!  My quest continues."}
{"text":"Oh, Spinato's... how I love your pizza.  I love your dining room atmosphere, your customer service, and most importantly your amazing pizza.  I must admit, the first time I tried Spinato's the pizza sauce was much sweeter than I was used to and I was unsure about it.  It has grown on me though and when I'm in the mood for pizza that is a little different than the usual, I make the trip to Spinatos.   Great family place too!"}
{"text":"4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts\"romantic\" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.."}
{"text":"AMAZING garlic cheese bread, meatballs and pepperoni pizza. Pedro was our waiter and he was simply AWESOME. Seriously, I never write reviews but it was the best service I've had eating out in at least the last 6 months. His recommendations were spot on and was so genuinely friendly plus kept my drinks filled and checked in on us regularly. Food was fast and delicious for a great price. I'm from E Mesa and I would totally drive out to Phoenix and come again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my father, mother and son. We asked for a booth, but the waitress gave us a half booth. The problem with this is there were about 4 half booths along the same wall so the booth just ran all the way across the room. My son is three, so he kept crawling on the booths trying to get attention from the other people sitting near us. My son needs to be contained in a closed booth while in a restaurant.   My dad ordered the chicken pesto pasta which I was going to order, but changed my mind. I did taste some of it and it wasn't very good. It was very oily and hard to eat. The flavor wasn't very good either. I ordered a thick crust pepperoni pizza which as okay. I felt the sauce was a bit too sweet.   It was okay and nothing more."}
{"text":"They have the best gluten-free spinach pizza at this restaurant the prices are high on pizza $14 for a personal size pizza for two but certainly worth it"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I love their Sicilian style pizza. All I've had here are their pizzas, usually the super 6 or Hawaiian &  their house salad. I love a thick crust pizza so of course I love theirs. The sauce is a little sweeter than most, but not anything overwhelming or a turn off. I've picked I pizza & ate there & the quality is the same for both. This is going to run a little more than Barros or some other local spots, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good service and family friendly. Happy hour prices are good for pizza and salads. That's usually the time we go to avoid a crowd. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Turns out the manager only said he was going to remove my pizza from the bill. Never did. Class act, buddy. Never again. Ever."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's!  We usually get Nicole's NEW Favorite, it's pretty basic, but my husband is pretty picky, so....ya. Still, it is consistently delicious and well made. They also have a spinach salad that tastes amazing, and is a pretty good size portion. When we go with a group of 4, we get 1 salad and 1 large pizza and everyone leaves satisfied.  Their homemade sauce (which you can buy on it's own) is pretty fantastic. I think that's what makes their pizza taste better than most others.  Another pro- Diet Dr. Pepper. Not many places offer that option, so I have a special place in my heart for those that do.  The only downside I can find with Spinato's, is that they need a location closer to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I came here for a girls dinner and I was pretty sad when I heard about their BYOB policy being gone. :( Before you were able to bring your own bottle of wine and pay an uncorking fee but they did away with that. As far as pizza goes, I enjoyed the crispy and semi burnt pieces in my pizza. Just the way I like it.   The service was pretty good for it being dinner service. We only had to wait for 35 minutes for the next available booth. I paid just under $25.00 with tip for my meal. I ordered a personal pizza, a glass of wine, and a side salad. That wasn't too bad for the amount of food I received.   The location itself is fairly new and clean. The service was prompt and food was good, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite takeout pizza in town.  The Chicago or the Combo are my standbys and they always hit the spot.    Don't sleep on the happy hour either.  With cheap small pizzas and beer on special it's perfect for a snack or a whole meal."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Love to take out or dine in- if it's a weekend night it'll be packed. Love the Greek salad and thin pizza"}
{"text":"I can't even explain how amazing the pizza is here. Everyone in my family loved it! (We went as a group of 10.) Also, the ambiance was nice and the wait staff was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, Spinato's well done well done..  Okay since i am yelping this based off  my experience it has to be a 4 not a 5.   The food...amazing, got the signature mama...something something..pizza, the one on the top. We ordered it with some italian sausage, since it doesn't come with meat at all. Well the pizza came out and it was AMAZING...but no sausage :( imagine if it had sausage i would have been happy.  The dough was/is a garlic dough which makes it delicious. I really loved the strong garlic essence coming off the pizza. All the flavors mingled together perfectly to create a sensational bite. (um hog the corner pieces if you can, they be the best) The sauce was sweet, which turned it into a different beast of a pizza. Either way i loved it, but would have loved it more with italian sausage.  The waitress admitted she forgot to add that to our order and made up for it with a discount.. Awesome! she offered we didn't even say eww take it back or anything (because at this point we were too hungry to wait again)  The service was a little awkward at times, but it was great none the less.  Their desserts are really good as well, i am no canolli connoisseur, but this was delicious to me...  i would easily blow my paycheck here IF they had wings too...but the pizza is good enough for half my paycheck..."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's. Their gluten free sandwiches are to die for! Their pizza is really great too. The Wrigley sandwich is absolutely amazing...sausage with marinara, grilled onions and peppers on soft bread. I highly suggest you try it. My boyfriend is not gluten-free but always orders his sandwich (The Davinci) with the gluten free bread anyways because it is SO good. I am always torn between getting one of their pizzas or their sandwiches. They have a nice wine selection and the staff here is very friendly and professional. I do have to say that I have ate at some of their other locations and I think the food at this location is the best."}
{"text":"I ate at another location on W. Bell last August, and I can attest to the fact that both places pizza tastes the same:  slightly sweet.  So, if a somewhat sweet tomato sauce isn't your thang stay away from Spinato's.  However, it doesn't bother me, and I did love the meat pizza and the spinach one.  Which one was best would be like Sophie's Choice for me as I loved them both. This location is very pretty compared to the other, but both are good.  I like Spinato's myself.  Good service, decent pizza. AND the server even asked us what type of crust we liked, so you can get thick crust or thin or medium--whatever--which I never had before.   We had a Black guy who said he was an ex-Marine, but I didn't catch his name (Brandon? Bradley?), but he was excellent so the group tipped super well to him. It was a gooooooo, and now I'm even fatter than I was this morning...LOL!  And I ate it all without a care about even one calorie...yeah, that good!"}
{"text":"The crust is not exactly great but holy crap, the sauce on these pizzas is sooooooo good.  It's one of my most favorite pizzas in town.  Big fan."}
{"text":"Best in the Valley no matter which location. Happy Hour is awesome! I'm a big fan of the \"Chicago\" but Roasted Fennel and Italian Sausage is great."}
{"text":"Spinato's has lost my business forever. Yes the pizza is excellent, however something must be done about phone orders. I was bragging to my mother in law, who was visiting from out of town, how incredible their pizza is. I planned on picking up a couple pizzas on the way home from work. I call first at 6:45. An answering system says I'm 3rd in line. After 5 minutes it kicks me off and sends me to voice-mail. I tried again about 8 times within the next hour. Same thing. Except one of the times it said I was 2nd in line but I still got booted off after 5 minutes. Ridiculous! I totally understand that places get crazy busy. But they should have someone actually answer the frickin phone! Hire more people if they have to. I gave up around 7:45. I ordered from Isa's instead. Great pizza and they have the decency to answer their customers phone calls despite how busy they get."}
{"text":"Their signature pizza (I don't know the official name) is amazing. We got a medium half and half of their \"most popular\" pizza and \"da greek\" pizza. Both were amazing, but the \"signature\" pizza was a bit better. I had it for left overs the next day and it was just as good.  This place is starting to become my favorite pizza place that isn't delivery. Really good."}
{"text":"Where to start? We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and meatballs for appetizers, DELISH ! Got 1/2 Hawaiian and meat pizza, excellent! Their vodka sauce is very tasty and I will surely be getting some to take home. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Got here after happy hour.  Looks like a great deal, but we were here on Monday so we got all day happy hour prices.   Only complaint no PBR draft!!!All places that have PBR draft get 3 stars off the bat!!   Food was awesome, I bitched  out and had a salad but my girlfriend had the Wrigley and it was incredible.   Her son had some pizza and it was fantastic.   Service was spot on and it was a fun atmosphere!!   Oh my Antipasto salad was really good!!  Really liked this place and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Spinato's is our go-to pizza place, and with it being walking distance from us, we go there quite a bit.  They have gluten free options throughout the menu, which is a must for me. Second to that, the staff is educated on cross contamination and up front about their kitchen. The gluten free cheesy-garlic bread is *to die for* and the pizza is amazing, not soggy or limp like most gluten free pizza crusts.  The staff is always super friendly and the prices are reasonable for a family owned, quality pizza place.  Happy hour prices are great, and if you're just looking for some snacking/drinks, I would highly recommend going during that time."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town!!!  \"...so good you'll jump up and slap the person sitting next to you...\" Yes, it is really that good.  So much flavor; with a secret ingredient in the sauce that is so secret most don't know there is a secret.  There are two signature pies that are vegetarian, that can hold there own against the classic pepperoni & sausage.  Their \"regular crust\" is a thin crust, and they do offer a thick.  Every pizza comes cut in squares."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about \"Phoenix Pizza\" after growing up with NYC pizza. However, Spinato's didn't disappoint! We had the spinach/garlic/tomato (their house special) and it was delicious. Different for sure than a typical NYC pizza, but oh so good. If you are in Phoenix definitely try it out! Oh, and the wait staff was super friendly and the beer selection great!"}
{"text":"What a joke!   Their food is good. But the service I just had for lunch was atrocious.   Ordered my food with an iced tea.    Received the ice tea at the bar and then had to ask the bartender for sweetener.    As I looked around the place was nearly empty.   The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware.  Frankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.     I am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.   They at least check on their patrons."}
{"text":"ordered a large combo and took it home. opened up the box and it looked amazing. tasted great too. if you like thick and dougy you will love it. cant wait to try some of the other pizzas."}
{"text":"We love spinatos pizza! Their wings are delicious as well:)  But the service is a hit or a miss. Sometimes well get great service but other times... Well get someone whos more interested in talking to co workers than giving good service.  But overall i love spinatos"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Spinato's! This is the original location and they have the best service. We we always share the spaghetti calzone with meatballs. Their salads are delicious and they have gluten free pizza for the people with medical conditions. The place is affordable and original. Love the vibe at this location. We had our rehearsal dinner at the new location on 7th Street - much larger and less traditional, but still the same great food."}
{"text":"Came here with friends last night and the experience was awesome. I really enjoy how small Spinato's feels despite how popular they are. It did take us 30 minutes to get seated, but that is to be expected on a Friday night. service was friendly and prompt and the server even gave out preggo friend a t-shirt for her baby which was incredibly unexpected. Two appetizers and a pizza were enough to satisfy the appetite of four people. The food was great like we anticipated so there were no surprises there. On top of all that they had a selection of a few Arizona wines which we definitely took advantage of. In short Spinato's scored high for me in all areas."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here last night. We took it to go. Also got the brownie for desert.   Was ready on time and very hot when we got it home. Was tasty. Their sauce is on the sweet side but well proportioned on the pie. Overall I really liked it.  Next time I will see what I can do about a little crisper crust.   The brownie was a bit dry but came with Carmel and chocolate sauce to pour over it. It was very yummy."}
{"text":"We have a very nice happy hour meal. My wife had the artichoke burchetta and I had a small pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was priced at only $10 and the burchetta was $6. The portions were very filling and tasted great. We sat in the bar area and had excellent survice. A very good experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Heard all the talk about the great food and it was average. Pizza was ok and spagetti was bland with sweet sauce.  I'll try again but not right away."}
{"text":"This place is so good! My boyfriend brought it home for dinner one night and wow! We got a cheese pizza and a meat lovers of some sort and I've never once actually enjoyed a cheese pizza before Spinato's!  Also their home made sauce is sort of sweet  which I really enjoyed. When went back again on another occasion and they were all very friendly and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. This place has definitely become a date night go to for my boyfriend and I!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and place.  Occasionally the pizzas come out with too much garlic for my taste.  Very cool bar side.  My go-to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Glendale Ave location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no chese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian on thin crust.    We recently took my in-laws here and it was a hit with all! My nephew loved the cheese steak calzone. My mother and father in-law got a thick crust pizza, which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday night. It was a default restaurant, because the one I wanted to go to was no longer there. This place was packed and was an hour long wait. I grumbled and whined, because I thought it was going to be like the Olive Garden. Boy was i wrong! The service was awesome. While the crowd waited, they passed out pizza samples and made sure everyone that wanted one got one. Once seated our server Clint (shout out to Clint!) was the best waiter I have ever encountered. Even though the restaurant was packed, he sat down to explain all the good things to order. We ended getting a small greek salad, Half Mama spinato & The Combo pizza, and a small cheese pizza. Everything was delicious. Shockingly, the stand out was the Cheese pizza. Will definitley be back to this place. Don't let the long wait scare you away. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Perfect what can I say yummy .good service  and the best sauce"}
{"text":"We love everything about this place.  We can't believe we didn't discover it sooner.  Thanks to Nick and the crew for always taking care of us and our kids!  If you want great food and love to support local, this place is perfect for you!  Get the Super Six if you're not on the wagon.  Oh and start with the mozzarella cheese bread.  The gluten-free Greek pizza is awesome if you roll like that.  And go on Thursdays.  Trust me.  Half price pitchers.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza, calzones, Italian sandwiches, salad. And great desserts. Family owned and feel.  This location is a bit small and worn down. So 5 stars for the food, 3 for the location, 4 overall."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we have ever had. Wow!!! We had the meat pizza and the mozzarella garlic bread that they serve with quality marinara sauce. We will definitely be back when we come to Arizona again! The service was also great!"}
{"text":"I called in a delivery order from a hotel. I gave the wrong room number 3 times and the girl on the phone was super patient w/ me.  The caprese stack was kinda soggy on delivery, but still yummy.   Personal size Pesto chicken hit the spot.  They delivered in under an hour (as promised)   Delivery guy was nice. He complimented my cute baby. I had her in my arms when I answered the door. He was kind enough to set my food inside the room for me given my hands were full. Great staff, great food, Papa J..."}
{"text":"Finally had the time to try Spinatos for our 41st anniversary. Victoria was our waitress and she was great. Started off with a capese appetizers and it was very refreshing. Moved onto six meat pizza/meaty pizza and Chicago steak calzone. Every dish was delicious and portions were substantial. Party of three ate for less than 60.00 dollars with drinks (sodas and beer). Enjoyed dinner so much that we are planning a revisit."}
{"text":"The pizza was about a 6 out of 10. The girl working in the togo section was excellent, her name i believe was Jessica very nice young lady."}
{"text":"I'm normally a huge fan and the spicy Italian pizza is maybe my favorite pizza in the world.  But....service can kinda mess things up. There were very few people there so I can't explain the lack of service.  It was almost comical to watch our server walk by....not acknowledge us...and act surprised when we wanted more water.  Or pretty much anything. We told her once we were not ready to order and that was a mistake.  Took her 15 min to check back. Then we were served the wrong food.  Just a mess.  Hopefully management is paying attention to signed tickets with zero tip.  Problems.  Pizza great. Experience....horrible."}
{"text":"Thin crust, sweet sauce....absolutely divine Chicago style not EXACTLY like Aurelio's but close. Can't wait to go there again tonight."}
{"text":"Ok so why was I under the impression that Chicago style was deep dish?  This pizza lover was surprisingly delighted at finding out the opposite, as thin crust is my favorite.  Spinato's did not disappoint.  Their sauce is deliciously sweet and their pizza abundantly topped.  I only wish I lived closer to this location.  However, I am frequently in this area and I have a sneaky suspicious I'll be stopping in often.  Tried the pepperoni and sausage and loved it.  My 5 year old couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the spinach pizza it was delicious. The sauce is sweet next time it's the calzone for me"}
{"text":"Nice place, good taste and good cheese also. At least the specialty is not spicy."}
{"text":"Chicago steak calzone was delicious. Nice waitstaff. Small cozy place. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"I'm in love. I have finally found my new favorite pizza joint! I'm usually not into thin crust, but theirs is perfect. Their pizzas have really great, fresh flavors - dipping it in ranch or blue cheese dressing is a no-no :) They also have a unique line-up of mouthwatering options, or you can top your own. The kids really enjoy this place and their menu is priced just right. For a family of four with an appetizer, drinks, 16\" pizza and gratuity, I never top $50. I highly recommend giving this place a try! I eat here at least 2x a month."}
{"text":"I used to get take out pizza from the Glendale Ave location and always thought it was great. I ordered delivery from the new one on 7th St. It was terrible. Not hot, just barely warm. And I never would have realized how bad Spinato's pizza tastes when it arrives so off temperature.   The next day I went down to Bashas next door for some groceries and stopped in to Spinato's to mention how bad my delivery pizza tasted. The manager was very defensive. Refused to apologize or admit anything could have been wrong with it. As I was leaving with my groceries in hand, the manager walked outside with me. I think to profile me socio-economically based on my car. I'm never ordering pizza here again. It was really bad and the management didn't care."}
{"text":"I actually feel a little guilty giving Spinato's only three stars.  The pizza is pretty high quality and made with very fresh ingredients.  The sauce (a little too sweet for me) has a very unique taste and certainly did not come from out the the can that most places use.  The website is easy to navigate and awesome for online orders.  The girl at the pickup counter was as friendly as could be.  So why only three stars?  It's probably for the same reason I only gave the Tempe location three stars a couple years back when I lived down there.  Spinato's is one of those places that is so close, but feels so far.  I live just over four miles away, so they don't deliver to my house.  Not having the time to dine out, but able to spear a few minutes to drive over, my fiancé and I  decided to give the place a try.  During that drive I passed more pizza places than I could count which left me begging the question is it worth it?  To be honest, I didn't think so.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good pizza.  I did like the Mamma Spinato's signature fresh spinach.  We also had the traditional vegetarian, which was an enjoyable pie.  Perhaps if I had dined-in, I would have enjoyed my meal a whole lot more.  But unless you live really close, I don't think take out is the way to go."}
{"text":"Our waitress Maria was PHENOMENAL. The food was amazing. Great portions and fresh ingredients. Definitely somewhere I would take family when they visit.   Try to get seated with Maria!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing service.  We were in the mood for some pizza and salad so chose Spinatos on 7th St.  Upon walking in the front door during the noon hour on a Saturday there was no hostess to be found.   We waited a couple minutes and then dipped our head into the bar and the bartender looked at us and mumbled something but acted like he wasn't there to assist us either.   We started looking for a table in the bar area and then the waitress showed up mentioning that only the bar top was open seating.  Seeing as the bar side had 3 people at the bar top and literally no other patrons we picked a booth where it would be easy to sit our daughter in her car seat.  The hostess went out of her way to be snippy that it wasn't open seating.  Perhaps a better response would have been \"sorry I didn't see you when you came in, I saw you were looking at tables in there, if you want to pick a table in the bar area go ahead and I'll follow you with menus.\"    We got up and left and had a good experience down the street at Culinary Dropout/The Yard! I recommend you do the same if you read this."}
{"text":"Teetering between 3&4 stars.. So I really like the pizza here. No questions about that, everything about their ingredients and flavoring is top notch. And their cranberry Apple gorgonzola salad is the bomb dot com.   Pricing is a little weird - you can't order a specialty pizza without a certain topping. They come exactly as they are. If you want even just a slight variation from a specialty pizza you have to build your own and pay per topping. Not a good or a bad thing, just an FYI.   Service is just okay. The host was awesome but our waitress clearly went out for a cigarette break multiple times during out dinner. I'm not a health freak and sometimes even I'll have a drag when I'm feeling angsty and drinking a cold beer, but I do not like smelling cigarettes while I eat. It was like a little Marlboro cloud came around every time food and drinks were brought over or taken away. It took my back to my high school days working at TGI Fridays - we always had the pre shift meeting outside so the team could have a cig before the dinner rush. You're classier than that Spinato's."}
{"text":"I first tried Spinato's about a year and a half ago.  I really liked it and wanted to go back, but for some reason, the wife didn't want to go back.  Yesterday, I finally convinced her to go back (with an assist from her sister, who is a fan).  We arrived right around 6:00pm and the wait was 30-35 minutes for a table  (Note:  This was odd as they have a patio with 5-10 tables, yet it didn't appear that they were seating anyone out there...not sure if it was because it was so windy?).  We decided to put in a order to-go instead.  Twenty five minutes later, our order was ready.  We ordered the Mamma's Signature pizza, which comes with baby spinach, diced tomatoes and garlic.  On the way back, I  was worried that the pizza wasn't going to be as good as I remembered and that I had built it up too much in my mind.  Nope, it was still delicious.  The nice sweet sauce and the crispy crust on the outside, it was great.  (The middle pieces seemed to get a little soggy, but I blame that on the drive home, rather than anything Spinato's did...).  Even the wife said it was better than she remembered, so it looks like there may be more Spinato's in my future!  The only downside was that we did not order any of their delicious garlic bread (one battle at a time!).    I give Spinato's four stars due to the deliciousness of the pizza and the fact that I'll likely make return visits.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place had the calzone baked spaghetti awesome sauce and the spaghetti made it really tasty.  Also had the spicy Italian pizza. Perfectly cooked awesome crust crispy on the outside. Soft and chewy on the inside. Perfectly crispy yummy.  Ordered it with pepperchinis sliced on top."}
{"text":"Came here because I received a free appetizer card. Menu was a pricey. They had kiltlifter on tap, which was flat. My buddy is a picky eater so we got the bread sticks for an appetizer. They were surprisingly delicious. My side salad left much to be desired, maybe one or two cucumbers in it. The house dressing was ok, but nothing like Nello's House Italian dressing. We ordered a Spicy Italian Thin Crust pizza which was absolutely amazing, makes me feel better about spending so much for dinner. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came after reading reviews, but this place charges you for bread and butter.  They call it an appetizer,  rip off"}
{"text":"Love the gluten free pizzas. Taste almost as good as an original crust. Nicole's new favorite and the super six are incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Bumped them up a star - went back for lunch again. My problem last time was their HORRIBLE customer service. Horrible. Lunch yesterday was SO much better. We were greeted at the door, she even opened the door for us. The waitress was super friendly and attentive. Obviously they've had some training since my last visit. I am SO glad. As for food, I had a yummy salad with chicken (I want to say Strawberry Gorgonzola - but my memory is so bad). My lunch partner had a sandwich, which she was quite pleased with.  A quick note about their pizza..... My last review tells you that I love it. My tastes have changed a bit and I just cannot handle that sweet sweet sauce anymore. They load it with sugar. Some folks like that, I know I did. I just can't take that much sugar in my sauce anymore. NOT dining them on that with this grade, just mentioning it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and ambiance!!! Ask for Maria, she is by far their best server :)"}
{"text":"Bar server rude!    Was enjoying chicken wings and antipasto salad at bar with family  - clean - comfortable - excellent food.  Major miss was our waiter/bartender James C  who inexplicably changed sports game on bar TV.   We and the  people surrounding us were watching the game.   Another TV was showing  westminister dog show and another the emmy's.  We asked why and James C informed us that it was a \"management request\" without an apology or furher explanation.  We sat in his service area to watch the game.   James C then spent his time watching the TV that he changed.  By the way another TV in the bar had that same show playing that James was watching - it was obvious James didn't want to miss his show! (Spinatos  on 7th St and Missouri)."}
{"text":"We had a truly excellent experience tonight at our neighborhood Spinato's! It was our first time eating in the restaurant, and since it was an informal Sunday lunch we decided to sit at the bar. The bartenders were very attentive and super nice. It was happy hour by chance, and we ended up getting the small $8 pizzas (ummm amazing deal because their smalls are pretty much a medium) and they were both SO good. We ordered the fennel & sausage pizza, along with the chicken pesto. We also were brought out some garlic artichoke bread for free, since the kitchen had accidentally made 2 and they had an extra one. That was super good too. All in all, a really great experience with great food and great service. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just ordered Delivery tonight!  I ordered the bread sticks (4) and the l'italiana (personal pan thin crust). And all i can say is wow. the breadsticks are amazing. the garlic was perfect. the pizza was think crust- but not too thin. it was the perfect size and crust.   When the delivery man came to the door, he handed me bag with plates, silverware, and had parmesean cheese & red peppers!  I am just very impressed with the service and extras given and of course the taste of the pizza!"}
{"text":"This should be a lesson to many other restaurants in recovery after a fumble.  My friend and I came in for dinner and ordered an appetizer and dinner salad followed by two entrees. No issues with the garlic bread or dinner salad (good food and lovely pomegranate balsamic dressing).  Then my friends sausage Florentine comes out but no food for me . However, our awesome server Jennifer was quick to follow the food runner and explain that the kitchen lost the ticket for my food.  Sounds bad...but she nicely recovers by offering to have my friends food made again to come out with my calzone and leaves the one he has now for us to nibble on while we wait. Manager Jenell comes by to apologize and offer dessert as well. Both the Florentine and my steak calzone were fantastic, FYI.  Accidents happen anywhere, it's genuinely all about 3 things for me: communication (keeping me updated on what is happening), contrition (genuine apologies from both the manager and the server) and restitution. Above and beyond scores on all three of these for Team J&J!   Conclusion: I'll be back"}
{"text":"Mixed bag. Turns out, I HATE the taste of their pizza sauce.  First time ever we ordered pizza and I could not eat any after 3 bites. I tried my husbands calzone and that's  how I knew it was the sauce. No good to me.  Maybe to sweet? I'm not sure why I don't like it. I also didn't care for the thin crust.   I will say, I picked off a few bites of the Italian sausage- Tasty. Roasted fennel- Very good. We also ordered boneless wings mild. Those were pretty good.  I'm sure we won't go back. But this was just my preference. Spinato's din't do anything wrong, I just didn't  care for the pizza."}
{"text":"I have always had take out here and it was always great. I recently ate at the restaurant and it was even better than take out (obviously). We ordered a thin crust pizza with sausage and a gluten free pepperoni pizza. Look, I'm not on the gluten free wagon, but I would have to say that the gluten free pizza tasted better than the regular pizza!! It was crispy and so delicious. I definitely recommend it regardless if you are gluten free or not."}
{"text":"Dinner was great (meatballs, stuffed mushrooms, mama's canzone are delish - artichoke crostini the only disappointment).   Service staff was wonderful.  Newly designed restaurant is great.  It's a tad pricey for Italian or it would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time I had this pizza was at the culinary festival in Scottsdale and it was great.  The general manager was super nice and the pizza was top notch.  Great sauce and a nice thin crisp crust. Good price and the restaurant is great and friendly.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I did not have the best first impression when I tried Spinato's about 6 months ago. I came in last week for happy hour and was so glad I gave it another shot. The menu was very diverse and the portions were very generous for the cost. We ordered sweet asian and hot wings, cheesy bread, meatball trio, and the small pizza with pizza and sausage. I remember not caring for the sweetness of their red sauce but I really enjoyed the sauce this time. I am super picky about meatballs and really enjoyed these. Can't go wrong with cheesy bread, they are super garlicky so be prepared. Pizza was medium crust with plenty of toppings. We sat at the bar and had awesome service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything but excellent food here.  Been going to this, their Tempe, and their Scottsdale location for years.  Great pizzas. Sandwiches are good, but the only thing I dislike is that they come with potato chips.  I hate that, it feels like a total cop out as far as a side.  My sister really likes their calzones.  As far as pizzas, the Get Meaty, Nicole's New Favorite, and the Signature Fresh Spinach, are all solid choices, but really, they all are. The Da Vinci and Wrigley sandwiches are really good."}
{"text":"Spinatos is always a great place to get delivery or pick up pizza.  This is my go to place for sure when ordering pizza in central phoenix.    Out of the many times ordering from here I can say that I have never actually been in the dining room.  The pick up area is always crowded and spinatos is always attentive and manage the crowd very expeditiously.    Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Finally!! I've been trying to go here forever and I made it! This location definitely needs a makeover it's like stuck in the 80's. The bar had 4 stools and the place felt kinda sad. But I got carry out so didn't have to spend much time in there. The pizza was amazing sauce was a little sweet but I loved it. The thin crust isn't that thin and the cheese is not crappy Kraft."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza. The crust is thin, but not crispy or tasty at all. The sauce is overly sweet. The cheese tastes like government surplus cheese used in school cafeterias. The pepperoni is bland and tasteless. Overall very average, maybe even below average pizza. Maybe the calzones are better. Phoenix, this is what you call good pizza? The 3-star rating is being nice."}
{"text":"My first time here was a great experience and I am looking forward to going back to try a plain thin crust pizza. I tried the thin crust with Italian beef and fresh tomato and it was very good. However to me the test of a really great pizza is to have it with just cheese and sauce. I also plan to ask if they will cut it NY style! I just like the triangle slices!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza and I love the happy hour items. Half off bottles of wine on Wednesday and that is when I like to go."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Italian food in the Valley! Their pizza sauce is so yummy you could drink it. Service is great, the atmosphere is great. They even have a large gluten free selection for my friend. LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Not only the best pizza in the valley -- but my favorite place for food of any kind (they have delicious salads!), drinks and atmosphere. So happy they are grown & continue to grow! Will be a lifelong customer. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly welcome when I came in, we were acknowledged as we walked in. They seated us right away, our server was busy so the hosts quickly got us our drink. So far the service today has been fantastic. Finally a server that can keep my drink full, the pizza came out very quickly and was very good. The pizza cut has a slight butter taste to it, they were not stingy on the cheese, and the sauce was just right to the point where it was not dripping. Overall this place has great pizza at a fair price."}
{"text":"There should be a rule for when a restaurant can name themselves Italian.   Wine was horrible Ordered cheese ravioli that was drenched in nasty sauce from a jar. Then calzone sailing in nasty red sauce, we sent it all back.  Clearly the chef has never been to Itsly."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here since it opened.  Through that time we have seen a lot of changes in personnel, currently they have the rudest & unprofessional staff.  The last two times here the bartender is very unfriendly not even a hello (simply not Anna who always remember your name and had a bright smile)  and the manager that was on duty 12/8 brunette took the prize Friday night with her horrible attitude towards me as I waited over 1 hour for our pizza order she basically told me this was my fault. Being in the customer service industry you can imagine, where I come from the the customer is priority & handled with dignity and respect. My family will not be returning to Spinato's, you simply need to take a serious look at how this store is being managed."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza in the area hands down. No frills but just extremely tasty.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just arrived home from a dinner at Spinato's Pizzeria on East Bell Road and decided I had to write a review right away.  I called a couple of days ago to see if they took reservations for a party of 8 on their patio. No, no reservations.  I was told that I would have to come down 45 minutes to an hour before the time I wanted in order to get my name on a seating list. So, my husband and I drove down there an hour early this afternoon. Two other people in our party were already there as well. We saw that the patio was virtually empty.  We went in and requested seating for our party and were told that we could be on the patio but it would be more than an hour wait and there were 'no promises'.  We asked if the 4 of us could be seated while we waited for the others since there were empty tables and we were told that they would not seat us because if our other guests arrived they would have to 'stand around and wait' while the tables were moved.  So WE had to stand around and wait. A long time.  The bar is very tiny and we unintentionally blocked the doorway for people coming and going. Two more of our friends arrived soon and there were no seats at the bar area for them.   So now the SIX of us really were 'standing around.'  We ordered drinks - beer, wine or Pepsi products only - and your tab cannot be transferred to your table on the same bill... you have to close it out. The patio was totally empty except for two little old ladies at a small table. We were not allowed to go out there for another 15 minutes until they were finished even though there were other tables that could have been drug over to accommodate us.  The manager and seating hostess were very cold with glum faces and were not friendly or apologetic about our inconvenience at all. Their attitudes were take it or leave.   After we were finally seated, we were rushed into ordering even though none of us had ever been there before. Our waitress was very impatient and rushed around the table asking people if they were 'ready'. My husband and I were paying for the entire group as it was a small get together for our anniversary, but we barely could discuss with everyone what kind of pizzas to order.  I just quickly chose three and we ordered appetizers, salads, some vegetarian items, other sandwiches and calzones.  It was hard to get the waitress to refill our drinks. We had to ask for water several times. They did not bring bowls for us to serve the family salad. We had to ask two different waitresses before we finally got them.   Most of the the food was wonderful but they do NOT have any wings at this location!  I can't find anywhere on the website where it mentions that. The wings were one reason we wanted to try this pizzaria in the first place. They didn't have all the ingredients for the desserts so some of us had to change our orders.  The waitress brought our bill long before we were even finished eating.  She interrupted my husband just as he was finishing the punch line to a story he had just told. Very rude and unprofessional.    I liked the pizzas, but my brownie dessert was as hard as a rock and I could only eat about half of it.  With so many wonderful restaurants to choose from in this town, we will not be going to Spinato's again any time soon... maybe a take out pizza sometime, but I don't care to experience the very poor service again. There are many other places that are more than happy to welcome larger parties and their big checks."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free Pizza! I was a little upset to discover they do not make the gluten free crust. Nicole's New Favorite was fabulous! My husband had the spaghetti calzone with ricotta cheese and meatballs, which he said was great and like the crust too. Staff was warm and friendly. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"After many years of ordering Spinattos Tempe pizza I have to say I'm very disappointed in the quality has gone down hill. Spoke to the manager and he says they have to weigh all the ingredients before they put him on the pizza. $22 for a large two topping pizza is a bit extreme with barely any pepperoni and green peppers. I am from Chicago and I have to say this was the only decent pizza place in the valley and now I guess I have to give pizza up!"}
{"text":"There is no other Pizzeria in the valley that even comes close to Spinatos in taste and quality. Check out their newest location. Restaurant is beautiful. Everything from the pizzas to the calzones are amazing. I have lived all over the country and I would recommend Spinatos as one of the best family run pizzerias in the country."}
{"text":"When I am in the area I always go to Spinato's, Great Happy Hour .The staff is very friendly and also helpful.I wish the bar was a little bigger but oh well"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about Spinato's, I was highly disappointed. It was my first pizza I had in Arizona, so maybe I had too high of an expectation? I've come to learn that pizza isn't the same here as it is on the East coast. Their sauce is too sweet and the veggies that they chose to put on their veggie pizza was disappointing.  For what you get, it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"The dinner salad is wonderful, the pizza is delicious, and the spaghetti filled calzone is superb!"}
{"text":"Sorry Leo. I had to update my review. So this is the second time I have been to this location. The last time was over a year ago. The first time didn't go well but I gave them another shot. The first time the service sucked. I chalked it up to the server maybe just having a bad day. Over the weekend we tried to eat here again. Well this time the service was ok. Just ok. Nothing special. The server didn't really seem too happy to be serving us. I'm pretty picky about service because my fiancé and I seem to get a long really well and have a friendship with the employees of the restaurants we frequent the most. The server wasn't too friendly and made us feel like we inconvenienced him by asking for a tiny loaf of bread to go ten minutes before they close. So what. It's bread. Deal with it. Anyways onto the food. I got pizza and I would say their pizza is pretty unique. The sauce stood out which is rare for a pizza place. Even after eating the leftovers the next day I couldn't decide if I like the sauce being so sweet or if it handicaps the pizza. Overall though the pizza was really delicious and I tore it up. The house bread with butter is a good starter.  The restaurant is nice. Some of the other employees around were friendly just not our server so much. I will go back again though in hopes that we finally find a server who is friendly because the food is good enough to make me want to go back. Minus 1 star for the service."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza!  Would be 5 star if the rest of the menu was  as good as their pizza. I've been going here for 7 years or so and it's always great.  It has become more popular so you will likely have to wait for a table on the weekends...especially if the snowbirds are in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Really a great looking building for a pizza place! Good parking, nice seating inside in booths or tables, a great bar and beautiful patio with a fireplace for outdoor dining. This was the first time I have been and not ordered Pizza. None of us did. Our group had the Italian beef sandwich, Italian sausage pasta, and the brussels sprouts and butternut squash penne. All were great. Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is a classic red sauce italian/pizza joint. The cocktails are spot on, the wine list is pizza appropriate. The bruschetta is lovely, with tomatoes that actually taste like tomatoes. The pizza doesn't skimp on the toppings, the sauce is nicely savory, and the crust is neither too thick nor too thin. For flavor combos, I particularly recommend the Chicago for those who eat meat and the signature fresh spinach for the vegetarians. Oh, and if you're feeling indulgent start with the spaghetti calzone. Carbs on carbs doesn't always work, but here it feels entirely appropriate."}
{"text":"I had a huge salad with salami, cheese and lots of olives.  I really like the house dressing, but I would have liked more meat on the salad. The meatballs were the star of the show,  great sauce and I really wish I ordered more off them. They have gluten free pizza and I almost went that direction."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ native and am obsessed with this place! I have been coming to Spinato's for years. The pizza is an absolute MUST some of the best I have ever had and that is saying something. The tomato sauce is so sweet and the pizza dough is flaky and light! If you haven't been to Spinato's yet your missing out!!!"}
{"text":"This is legit pizza, and I am a real tough critic when it comes to pizza. We ordered two pizzas: Italian beef pizza and a sausage/mushroom/ black olive pizza. Their sauce is sweet, but not too sweet. Their Italian beef with giardiniera pizza is the best version I have had. It's clear that the Italian beef is made in-house.  The sweet sauce balances the spice in the giardiniera perfectly.  Thier sausage was good, but not the best I have had. I like fennel sausage with a little more flavor. Overall, the pizza was great. I will be going back to try an Italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Had the Sicilian crust.  Not the type of pizza i want to eat again.  The place was crowded, lots of families.  I would go to Grimaldi's next time."}
{"text":"Worth the wait.  The pizza is fabulous,  along with any other dish you may be in the mood for!"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic!  Absolutely go with the thin crust and not the thick, it is the best thin crust pizza in town and is their specialty.  Crunchy buttery crust packed high with toppings. If you go with the L'Italian (add caramelized onions) and the Super Six, you can't go wrong!   Just a cool observation - While we were waiting for our table in the bar on a busy Friday night we saw servers/hosts walking around to the packed waiting area with pizza for people to munch on while they waited for their pizza.  Genius!  This family owned business does it right.     We are very impressed so far with their pizza.  We will certainly be back for more.  If we can get ourselves to stray from the pizza one night, we hear the calzones are to die for!   I vote: \"Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom\" :D"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! The gluten free tastes almost identical to their regular crust! Great service and great food"}
{"text":"You know, when I first moved to Scottsdale on the far east end of town, we didn't know where to go for pizza. So we tried Spinatos. The pizza is different, a bit sweet, but a good different...for a while.  We got bored of it though and the menu is so limited that we finally stopped going. The service is fine, not great. They need to expand their menu to more pasta dishes or something."}
{"text":"All things being good, I really want to eat a place with good pizza. Staff from front to back have always been very friendly and helpful. The pizza and dishes are quality, making Spinatos one of those really good places in the area that is worthy of being in the regular rotation of dining out."}
{"text":"Dined in a few times, and I always enjoy them. Such a warm staff. We just ordered a half cheese-half veggie for delivery and enjoyed it a lot. Good amount of toppings. Don't fall off.   *Slightly* over their quoted delivery time, but what else do you expect on a weekend at dinner?  The girl on the phone was extremely friendly and answered all of our questions and the driver was charismatic as well.  Might start asking for a classic pie cut, however. They cut the pizza into squares which is nice for picking but we prefer the alternative for our dinner.   All in all, good pizza. Fills in the east coast gap, that some of us non-Arizonianborn may feel."}
{"text":"You guys are just awesome!! Thanks for the little half and half boundry on my pizza!! Such great pizza!"}
{"text":"Thanks again to my Yelpers. I live like a block from this place and never thought to try it because Pizza can just be pizza sometimes. I LOVE pizza too!. Its hard to find a good joint.   We went there on Friday night for some pie and maybe some dessert.   Good service. Good people. Good food. We had the Get meaty and the Spicy Italian. Not sure which one i liked better. Both were excellent. Fresh ingredients and it was hot too. The brownie dessert was pretty awesome too.   Ken stopped by our table and had a nice conversation with him about Yelp and how we found his restaurant and how I would go home and yelp about Spinato's."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! The place is always packed yet I always get fast, friendly service. I take every family member that visits me here and they have yet to disappoint and I doubt they ever will. Just like everyone else says, the sauce here is phenomenal. Keep it up Spinato's."}
{"text":"I really like this little place.  I'm a native New Yorker and never liked Chicago pizza.  I thought it was all deep dish, but this really-thin-crust pie cut into squares is just a lot of fun!  The cheese and toppings are really good (I have to try that spinach pie still).  Some folks complain that the sauce is sweet; I think it's good, without the oregano edge.  The people are nice, the salads are really good.   I go here every time I'm in the neighborhood.  Try it."}
{"text":"I came here for take out on a Monday at lunch and was helped by a wonderful hostess who after talking to me about some vegetarian menu items, directed me to the take out area which is a great idea! It has a separate door so you can quickly pick up your take out. Very nice and helpful staff :)  After so many of my friends raved about Spinato's food, I was not as easily swayed. I ordered the Mama's Spinach Pizza which was said to be their best seller. It had everything I love. My first impression was SUPER SALTY. Next I was overwhelmed with roasted garlic, like a garlic truck ran me over.  Don't get me wrong, I love garlic but it was called a spinach pizza and I did not taste any spinach although it was covered in it. I also didn't care for the overly sweet sauce. It wasn't disgusting or anything just not my favorite. Something about the sweetness of garlic when it is roasted and the sweet sauce = too much sweet  and didn't mesh well to me. I really want to give this place another star so I am looking forward to coming back and trying a different pizza. Maybe the Mama's Spinach one was just not for me. I will update my review when I do.  If I were to make one suggestion it would be to LAY OFF THE SALT!  That's what salt shakers are for. If we want salt we will put it on ourselves."}
{"text":"This should be 5 stars all around, especially when you compare it to the rest of the garbage pizza out here in AZ. This is by far the best thin crust pizza we've got, perfect combo of tasty sauce, crust and ingredients balanced out."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza!  Garlic bread was good too!  A little pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Went for pizza and order the meat pizza. Here are all the good things: the greeter was friendly; the server was friendly and attentive; the pizza crust was crispy, yet chewy; the meat and mozzarella were fresh and tasy.  The negative? The sauce was SWEET. Yuck. I've had sweet pizza sauces in other cities, but the sauces in Phoenix tend to be on the spicy side. It ruined the pizza for me that this sauce was sweet."}
{"text":"While I enjoy the pizza and the staff,  I was disappointed in my delivery . The pizza was terrific as usual . Ordered dessert which did not come as advertised . Ordered the Poundcake which was suppose to come with berries and Gelato. I got the poundcake without any of the toppings making the dessert a waste . When I called the response I got was disappointing . I ended up with a useless dessert which went into the garbage ."}
{"text":"Great food and nice setting. Love the pizza and the Chicken Caesar Salad!"}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE PIZZA.   If you have never had a Spinatos Pizza you need to try this place. You will be very impressed.   Great Service!   Great Food!   Great Desserts!   We have been coming here for a while now and cannot get enough of this place, They have a great tasting pie. We usually get a Hawaiian and once you put the first piece in your mouth you cant stop eating it. I highly recommend this place for your next stop. They have 4 locations and all family owned and operated. I have ate a lot of pizza over my time and this the best hands down.   Also try their desserts they were created by the owners wife and are a great compliment to the end of a great meal.   Once you eat at Spinato's you become like family. MMM GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian food in town!  Been coming here for years and have tried everything on the Eastside of town. We have taken out of town guests here and even they AGREE!    Every time we come here we always order a take and bake for home after we dine in. This place has got great service, good, atmosphere and great prices.   If you want the best, come try this place. Many yelpers agree. :)"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had. And I have worked at 2 pizza places. I recommend the thin crust basil pizza. It's good enough to not need more toppings than that! Also, the service is personal and they have a half-price wine happy hour. And we got a birthday cannoli!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the new location on 7th st. I liked the wings but thought they could of been crispier. My pizza was good as usual."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in uptown Phx.... The pizza is to die for as well as the pasta and salads... Only thing I would say could improve is their delivery. Every time we order from here they forget something. Other than that it's a great place."}
{"text":"Management and wait staff has changed and not quite as good as it once was. Been a Spinatos fan for 10+ years and Pizza at this location has been inconsistent. Tempe location has been the same great pizza for 10 years. Ahwatukee location seems to differ based on who's cooking. The biggest change in the last year is the bar staff isn't what it once was. Not quite the friendly attentive service and slot of standing around talking. Still one of my favorites but wish the service piece and consistency would improve to get even close to the TEMPE location."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the sauce on the pizza it's very sweet but the rest of the family loved it.  So if you like a really sweet sauce this is a good place for you."}
{"text":"I love pizza so much that at one time in my crazy life and opened and owned two pizza restaurants. Of course we all like our preferred style of pizza. New York, New Haven, Chicago, Sicilian....we could go on forever. Spinato's Pizza is perfect for my taste. Almost as good as Ledo's on the University of Maryland campus. First the crust was thin and perfect. (There are other crust options...but I ordered thin.) The sauces was sweet. The cheese had just the right amount of greasiness and the toppings were plentiful. This is NOT crispy crust brick oven pizza...this is great loaded with toppings pizza. I have now found my favorite pizza place in Phoenix (sorry Oregeno's!) and I will be back."}
{"text":"The spicy Italian pizza has changed my life. I can't even try anything else here and all other pizza is just ordinary. Unfortunately they are closed on Mondays but the pizza rocks. Yummy...change in review...they are now open on Monday. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! This location is older and more low-key than their others. I feel like it's my neighborhood pizza joint, but I can still get an elevated Italian dining experience here."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Spinato's by my coworkers. They knew that I was from Chicago and really wanted to take me here my first week on the job. I'm so glad that they did because this is the best pizza that I've had in Scottsdale so far. We usually do pizza Fridays and of course, Spinato's is a very popular one on the list.  Everyone always gets the Lil 7 which is the perfect size for 1 person. When you first get it you always think that it wont be enough. But trust me, for the the average person it is. The sauce to cheese ratio (super important) is perfect with just the right amount of seasoning. The crust is really good too, no need to not eat it to save room.  Oh, can't forget the rabbit pellet ice. I think it's a Midwest thing since a lot of people think I'm weird for calling it that. It's the same ice that they have at Sonic too if you're familiar. Some people are obsessed with it.   This is the perfect lunch place because it's fairly quick and a personal pizza starts as low as 5 bucks, can't beat that! I've never had their salad, apps, or desserts but they all look good."}
{"text":"This is got to be the best pizza I've ever had.. love the thin crust.. great salads too.. so good after having munch my first time Wednesday on Friday night had to order delivery.... will definitely recommend and be a regular customer.."}
{"text":"If you want to eat authentic Italian food, then Spinatos is just the place!!!! Family owned with a family friendly atmosphere!!!! The sauce is the boss for sure!!!!! I love, love, LOVE the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, where do I start?  OK, if I were just judging this place on food alone it would be 5 stars!  I had an italian beef dip sandwich and it was great!  So much flavor and very filling!  Unfortunately for this establishment we don't just rate on food alone.  Service: SLOW!  OMG it was slow.  We went around 130pm and it was totally dead.  Only a few people eating.  I know this is a time for the place to recover from the lunch rush but I feel it is a good time to see if they have really good service.  If they can still provide great service while doing their tasks then they have done it!  This place failed horribly.  Our waitress was very friendly...when she acutally was around.  Next, DO NOT ORDER A PITCHER OF DRINKS! Our waitress told us it would be enough for 4 people.  There were three of us so we thought it would be a good deal... it was $24 and we got two and half drinks out of it.  We problably should have complained about it.  Anyway, go for the food but just know your service will be crap.  As long as you go in with low expectations on the service you won't be dissattisfied."}
{"text":"Average take out pizza. Too salty and bad for your HTN. Still ranks better than your usual chains."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley! Forget that crap about hoyti toudi Pizza Bianco, it's crap compared this place.  Keep  up the good work, Oprah should feature Spinatos on her show Instead of that other dump, pizza bianco."}
{"text":"Quickie:  Boyfriend and I picked up a \"Mama Spinato's 'Signature' Fresh Spinach\" pie and a Greek salad on Friday.   As soon as we got home we opened the pizza box lid and each grabbed a slice. One bite in we each explained \"HOW HAVE WE NEVER EATEN THIS BEFORE?!?!?!\"  My car smelled like garlic for 3 days after. WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Service was timely (we sat at the bar) otherwise it would've been a 35 minute wait for a table... eekk.   Pizza: fair price for its size. The cheese may have been overcooked? otherwise. I ate that pie up.  Beer: must have been the end of the keg that might have been a bit old. The brew itself was in my opinion too chilly and took away from the already maybe flat beer.  Girlfriends pasta was not terrible or exciting. Kinda like watching the Macy's thanksgiving day parade...  Bartender was attentive and friendly. Definitely a plus.  All in all, I live across the street and wanted some ZA so we took a chance and were given a decent experience and may one day come back."}
{"text":"We live within walking distance and decided last evening to try for dinner (we had previously had take out pizza which we enjoyed).  The food was warm and looked appetizing, but was quite bland and the crustini that was 'still in the oven' when our meals were delivered, never appeared.  The restaurant was perhaps 50% full.  Our server barely served, after our check and credit card did not come back after 20 minutes when went to the hostess that was able to find our server.  She stated that she had returned the check and had thanked us.  After she realized her mistake she did at least have the integrity for her incorrect statement."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places by far! Their thin crust and pizza sauce is amazing...Great place to go with the family, you can't go wrong! I highly recommend trying it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"After a bad experience somewhere else I was really pleased to come here and find the staff to be very efficient and friendly. I had my baby with me and she was in the not having it mood so I opted to order my pizza to go. I was very appreciative of the quick service so I could get out before my baby had a total meltdown.  The pizza- I always order gluten free and it never disappoints. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but I always order savory toppings. Bonus: they don't skimp on the toppings! They also gave my baby a cute little spinatos tshirt :-)"}
{"text":"I agree with Yuck.  this is a boring loud terrible place to eat.  the food is below average and a waste of money.  Much better places to eat then here.  My dad had the meatball sub which was huge but nothing special about it just ordinary.  I ordered the Gluten free pizza - but it was not good - the sauce tasted like Hunt's tomatoe paste - maybe if they had a home cooked sauce it would have been better.  Plus there Gluten Free pizza is not really Gluten free because they make it in the same ovens as their wheat pizza.  and it was terrible, we sent items back and threw stuff away.  if you are looking for good NY Pizza try NYPD much better than this place by far."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!! Best pizza I have probably ever had. I got one of their specialty pizzas, which had feta, spinach, and bell peppers on it, and then I added pepperoni. I literally went to two locations in one week because it was so good! I have a friend who likes their gotten free pizza. There was a bit of a wait at this location on Saturday night, but we expected that."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended to us - so much so that if we did not like our meal he would reimburse us.  No need to...  We had a large pizza - pretty good toppings - I don't think the mushrooms were fresh though and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.  The service was very friendly and we also had a dessert - Apple Spendata (sp) very good.  We definitely go back and try something different.  We visited for lunch on 12/31/11 - not too busy  - yet......."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue as we eat here at least 4 times per month.  We drive from South Chandler to have this amazing food.  Wings are a super 5 star and the pizza to die for.  The sauce is one of a kind delish!  And we have never had anything but superb service!"}
{"text":"I went to Spinato's to pick up a couple of their delicious pizzas for carry-out. As I waited I decided to go over to the bar. The bartender was less than friendly--he did not make eye contact, he did not speak in complete sentences. It was as if my presence at his bar disturbed him.  After wiping the bar down in front of me with a filthy cloth, he placed some menus on the wet surface, and I told him I did not need I menu. He left me and returned to his register without giving me the opportunity to tell him what I wanted to drink. I only wanted a beer, and I was sitting right next to the tap. Shortly after he returned to his register,  a couple came in and took their seats right next to the register, and they received their drinks within a matter of seconds. I hate to pull a certain card, but it is the only thing that I can think of as to why the service I was provided was subpar. Spinato's, please train your people how to be courteous to all. I will avoid the bar and maybe even the food from this day forward."}
{"text":"This place has the Best Italian Beef Sandwiches, not to mention an awesome Pizza. And I love the Crushed Ice too. We sat in the bar and we're served by lovely \"Emerald\" truly a joy!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and they were great!  I had a dog with me and the restaurant patio was closed. So my mom and I ate on the to-go patio. Since we didn't have a waitress because we were getting the food from to-go, Marissa took it upon herself to still bring us our food, appetizer and wait on us with a smile and upbeat attitude. She was great!  And the food was yummy too! Give Marissa a raise, she was EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea it was possible to make a pizza so bad, well actually make 3 pizzas so bad that not a single person could finish it, or ever want another pizza that carries the name Spinato's, but they somehow managed it.  We had heard how wonderful this place was, how we just had to try it, how it has some of the best pizza in phx.  I can say without a single doubt that it was possibly the most horrible pizza I have ever put in my mouth.  The Service was ok, the restaurant was clean, and bright, atmosphere was good.  The Pizza itself was beautiful, visually the pizza made you want to eat the whole thing.  However, the first thing you taste when you put a piece of their pizza in your mouth is SUGAR.  Now I know people may like that, but I don't, pizza should not be sweet and this pizza, all three of them tasted like used a 25lb bag of sugar to make each one.    We usually try a place at least twice before saying never again... but given how horrible all three pizzas were, there is no way we will ever step foot back in Spinato's."}
{"text":"We used to live in the Chicago area so we love pizza and Spinatos is fabulous! The sauce is so yummy. Food is fresh and very tasty. Their pizzas are terrific but their sandwiches and pastas are also very, very good. We ate there again today and our server Ian was polite, friendly and attentive. Spinatos continues to be our family's favorite!"}
{"text":"My first time here at the new location. Garlic cheese bread, 2 pasta dishes and pizza. All excellent. Keiko was our server and did a great job. Spinato's has yet to disappoint and remains a family favorite."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, the sauce and crust were fantastic. I got the antipasto salad, thing was massive, loaded with cheese, salami, pepperoni, cheese and olives. It was a meal in itself, I ended up taking half of it home.  Sat at the bar and the service was great."}
{"text":"We had the cheesy garlic bread for an appetizer. It came out cold. So that was a nice start. The pizza looks amazing but the taste was mediocre. I can't remember what it was called but it had balsamic vinegar and sausage. It seemed very dry to me. Very little cheese."}
{"text":"I will be the first to say Italian is probably my least favorite food... But this place may have just changed my mind! I got the meatball trio with the vodka sauce. .DELICIOUS!! i now will go there and try other things!"}
{"text":"I've driven past here a million times to have coffee at True Brew; how have I not stopped in before?! It's smack in the middle of a strip mall-so you'd almost miss it if you didn't know it was there. We went on a Friday night and it was jam packed.  We sat out on the patio, which does a great job of disguising it's parking lot with black out shades. A great family vibe, and really tasty thin crust pizza (I had the marguerita pizza..so good)!! Definitely a new fave pizza spot for me."}
{"text":"I am a Chicagoan. Not the suburbs of Chicago, but the heart of the city. There are a number of things I miss about my city: Garrett's popcorn, neighbood festivals every weekend, Lou Malnati's pizza and of course my family.....not necessarily in that order. When someone says they have Chicago-style pizza I feel it is my duty to try it. There are a bunch of pizza places in Chicago that have amazing pizza and they all do it differently so there isn't just way one to make Chicago-style pizza, but Spinato's came pretty damn close.   We ordered the Chicago-style with 1/2 mushroom for my man. The mixture of yellow and red bell pepper was a nice touch, most places use green bell peppers. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, I'm not used to that. The pizza was not greasy, had the right amount of cheese and toppings and the cornmeal crust reminded me of home.   I'm happy to say that Spinato's lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"My friend had recommended Spinato's Pizza so I decided to try it out with her since I had never been and she had liked it. Spinato's is a locally owned family pizzeria that started in Phoenix in 1974. They now have 5 locations spread throughout the valley. Since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, I was more than excited to try this new pizzeria especially since it was Chicago style pizza. The best pizza I ever had was in fact in Chicago.  We arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening and the place was starting to getting crowded. The hostess seated us in the bar area since it seemed like a more ideal place to sit versus the dining room. She dropped off the menus and advised that our server would be with us momentarily. We waited about 15 minutes or so before our server acknowledged that we were in her section. She got our drink and food orders since we had more than enough time to make up our minds.  My friend opted to get the Going Greek salad (side $3.99) and the Tomato Basil Bruschetta ($7.29). I decided on the personal 7\" sized Baked Spaghetti Calzone w/meatballs ($5.49). I decided to not drink as I had to drive and I wanted to get dessert.  She got her salad and the bruschetta which she shared with me. When I think of bruschetta, I imagine it on a sturdy crispy piece of french bread or baguette  not on a piece of focaccia. Now don't get me wrong - I love focaccia as much as the next person, but focaccia isn't a sturdy piece of bread to pile on tomatoes drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bruschetta was good but did not blow me away by any means. It had good flavor but it's not something that sticks out in my mind.  Half way through the bruschetta, our server brought the baked spagetti calzone which was enormous and I got the smallest size! I can only imagine what the other sizes look like (out of control). It smelled delicious and had marinara sauce spilling over the top of it. I took my first bite and was absolutely horrified by what I tasted. The sauce was sweet?! Who on earth makes sweet marinara sauce? That should be a crime! It didn't even have the slight essence of Italian herbs that are a requirement in all marinara sauces and the sweetness was overbearing. I had to doctor it up by piling on the parmeasan and the red pepper flakes before I deemed it edible. I was able to eat half of it before I decided it was time for dessert.  The dessert was Spinato's only saving grace from getting one star from me. I'm partially lactose intolerant and can't eat ice cream, ranch or sour cream (I know my life sucks!) they had gelato which I can eat! My friend got two scoops of vanilla bean and chocolate and I decided to get pistachio, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla bean. The gelato was decadently smooth and creamy. I wasn't thrilled about the pistachio as I could sense the almond extract in it and I'm not a fan! The raspberry and vanilla bean made up for it. The raspberry sorbet was tart and sweet and mixed with the vanilla bean balanced each other out. We had to be wheeled out because we were so full...it was official - I had a spaghetti calazone baby! Overall, I was not impressed with Spinato's and there are better pizzerias in Phoenix that one can go to. I like that it's locally owned, a family owned business, and their gelato."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  It has a very home feel to it and everyone is super nice. Food is not stellar, but way above average and well worth the extra trip."}
{"text":"Great pizza (sauce was pretty special), meatball sub, and spaghetti calzone! Awesome service from Aaron. Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Good atmosphere.  I usually sit in the bar with several TV's with some form of sports playing, God forbid I have to keep up in a conversation.  Greek salad is my favorite.  The meatball trio from the appetizer section is great.  The cheese they use on top is quality.  I'm pretty sure I could eat a bowl of melted cheese with some sauce alone.  The sauce on the pizza was a bit on the sweet side but doable.  The sandwich was good.  The calzone was good enough to be revisited.    Their hot Italian sausage is awesome.  Pasta with vodka sauce was very good."}
{"text":"Spinato's deserves an A for effort, and might deserve more stars at some point, but they are just one of many pizza joints in N. Scotts so it's tough to stand out.  They sure are trying real hard, though.    First, they put some effort into the decor.  Still looks like a pizza joint, but does have some modern italian touches.  I also like it that they have a lot of booths and patio seating.    The help is super-de-duper happy and friendly.  I've only seen female servers so far, so on a busy all-hands-on-deck night it's a lot like walking into a sea of Stepford wives...or maybe cheer camp.  Or Fembots, all saying, \"Hello, Mr. Powers\" in unison.  I'm still trying to figure out if I like it, but that probably says more about me than them.  I can say I'd prefer they sacrifice a little of the cute factor in favor of more efficiency so the drink refills, timely food service and check are consistently on point.    Spinato's pizza sauce is like none I've ever had. In a good way.  That sauce, along with their thin crust and cheesey goodness, makes for some fairly unique pizza.  Their salads - even the side salads - are by far the best I've ever had in a pizza joint.  You have a choice of spinach, lettuce or combo of both.  They always taste fresh made, and have lots of good veggies that are in good shape (you know, haven't been sitting around a while).    Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Phoenix area, hands down. The secret is in the sauce. The sauce is sweet and savory and compliments any toppings you may like. The crust is also thin and crispy. Their restaurant is always packed, but they are worth the wait. We usually get take out, as they do not deliver."}
{"text":"by far the best pizza in the valley. Service could not be better. Madison and Canon cannot be beat for service. Highly recommend this restaurant Anything on the menu is superb. Cannot even think of going anywhere else for pizza"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in Phoenix!!  The ingredients are fresh, the staff is friendly and quick to recognize you, and the wine/beer selection is definitely satisfactory!!  My favorite is the Super 6... it's the best supreme pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this little gem of a restaurant down the street from my work. Service was great from the hostess to the server to the food runner. Food was amazing! My husband ordered a calzone and I had a turkey pesto sandwich. Even the salads were really fresh tasting and good. We had a small issue with one of our items and it was handled immediately. I'm looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Spinato's pizza was when my friend introduced me to it with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin crust pizza and I really enjoyed it. The next time I was in town I stopped in and tried the restaurant itself, and really had a good time.  I don't know what this place was before, but I swear it used to be a Chili's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well decorated.  Warm well decorated interior with a full bar and a great menu. Lots to choose from, and not just pizza (even though its their specialty.)  I really like the decor of this place. Not overstated, but classy enough that you can take your parents here and not have them freak out like mine do.  It feels like a great date spot too.  Service was great, and I really had a good time and the pizza and salad that I had were tasty.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. Check it out, worth the trip if you want something different and want to have a good time."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for years, but in the last 2 months something has changed in the kitchen. I say that since the wait staff and bartendesr are the same and have worked there for along time.  In the last couple of months I have been served the wrong pizza, gluten free pizza that I didnt order, Dining with 4 friends, half of us got our food, the other got theirs about 10 minutes later, they said the kitchen has a new manager so orders were mixed up.  Tonight called for Italian beef sandwich to go, order taker informed me that it would 45 min because the kitchen was backed up.  Told them forget it.   Hope they get this figured as they have been great in the past."}
{"text":"A absolute marvel, great food served fresh hot and with a smile. The ambiance of this place is like yourin italy visiting a italian family and you are welcomed in.   A new building tgat can seat 200 plus, vaulted ceilings, Comfortable plush seating ,lighting done just right. the pizza is crisp generous amoubts of cheese the sauce unrivaled .  a great place to start memories of great celebrations.  Plenty of parking also.  ENJOY"}
{"text":"So good you don't need cheese I'm a bit ashamed, as a tempe native, to say I didn't know about spinatos until a few years ago. But I'm so thankful that I know about it now.  I can't eat dairy- so pizza is usually right out. But the mama spinatos with its marinated spinach and the pizza sauce is so good I don't miss the cheese. The gluten free crust is also good, not as good as the regular, but good. My two year old will eat her weight in meatballs. And they're very family friendly.   The best pizza in the valley, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Third time coming to this pizza place, but first time at this location,  The pizza was good as always but this experience was a bit more full service then the smaller Tempe store, which I had been to before.  Having a full bar, having a much bigger restaurant and looked to be a bigger menu but I could be mistaken on that.  I came in at 5 on a Sunday and was surprised to find out it was happy hour ! A good happy hour to boot ! The bartender Clint gave me lots of different amazing sounding drink suggestions, and cool to see a pizza place that does freshly made cocktails, he mentioned they make their own fruit juices and simple syrups, not enough places do that now a days and it shows in drink quality. I tried a few of his suggestions and enjoyed them both!  It was also happy hour for their food so I got way more then I could possibly eat. A very generous portion of garlic cheese bread for 4 dollars ! That could have been enough but a small pizza for 9 bucks with like 4 different meats on it was to good to pass up !  The girl who dropped my food off was super nice and asked if I needed anything else and brought me out some extra sauce, just little things like that go a long way!  If your'e coming for a drink and some pizza and don't wanna spend crazy amounts for quality product come check this place out. I suggest sitting at the bar and ordering the old roy !  wont find better costumer service wont find better pizza.  only thing I could say would make this the perfect experience was if they had the game on."}
{"text":"Pricey for pizza but worth it every so often. Their thin crust is all I've had as far as pizza goes and I sub pesto for pizza sauce as it's my preference but my fam says the regular pizza sauce is good. The only time my daughter was disappointed was when she inadvertently ordered a pizza that had a balsamic drizzle. This was her fault though. Lesson learned: read the menu carefully. :/ I've also had the crimini stuffed mushrooms (awesome) and the chicken basil linguine with artichoke hearts. (delicious and it was carry out to boot) All in all great food and good service. Expect a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Very sweet sauce but extremely tasty! If you like sweet pizza, this is for you. The toppings are all awesome and plentiful. Pizza is cut into sections instead of slices. I'm getting hungry now."}
{"text":"Nice place to meet but honestly, I feel like they run their ingredients through a flavor removal machine.  So bland.  Even the \"spicy\" menu items are lame.  It's a cool name, nice place and I know many people who swear by the food there.  I don't get it.  I wish the pizza tasted as good as it looks."}
{"text":"Sooooo amazing. We had a veggie pizza, and a spagetti calzone. I cannot say how happy I am with the food.  We even got a pizza uncooked to go. The service was amazing.  Would return any time. I can say that if you do not like the regular pizza crust you won't like this. It is similar to a dense focaccia."}
{"text":"Spinatos has been my moms favorite restaurants to come to, to celebrate her birthday for years. Every single time we've come the food and service has been awesome. Sadly, this was not the case last night. We ordered garlic bread as an appetizer that never came out. Our waiter never came back to check on us in between the time we placed our order and the food arriving, which took over 40 minutes, our calzones were cold on the inside like they had been sitting out of the oven for quite some time and the majority of mushrooms inside them were still half raw... we have come here over a dozen times and every single time ordered the same calzones. They've always been too hot to even cut into immediately and steam just barrels out when we take our first bite. This time it was the complete opposite. So disappointed and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love Spinato's. The sauce is just lightly sweet which makes it unique and a little like Grandma's.  Oh and they have the best spinach pizza in AZ....  Thanks for never changing Spinato's!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I've ever eaten, and their salad was fantastic! We ordered the margarita pizza. The crust was amazing and the pizza wasn't all greasy and over cheese. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Would of rather ordered from Dominos. Everything was over cooked or burned. Sauce was lousy and needed a microscope to find the meat in the calzone. The service was good though."}
{"text":"Fellow employee suggested to stop in for happy hour. I sat down at the bar with 10 other patrons and 2 bartenders. I waited over 5 minutes to be acknowledged while the male bartender was 4 feet away flirting with the women next to me. I ordered stuffed mushrooms that were ok and 6 wing that came out quick but small. I had 2 miked drinks very light on the booze. I won't be back there is too much competition."}
{"text":"I've been back at least a handful of times since this experience and was told unfortunately it was their summer (high school) help and that he knew who the person was (sounds like I wasn't the only one unhappy with her). I was apologized to for the awful service and assured this person wasn't there anymore.  Every since this lousy worker has left the phone is answered promptly to take my order and when I pick it up someone has been at the pick-up counter or there shortly after I arrive. Pizza is terrific as always!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best in valley.  Sweet sauce. Flaky crust.  Outstanding!  Always lots of workers at cash register expecting tips for doing their job of handing pizza to customer for take out."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Will definitely be coming back!! Everything I've tried here has been amazing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the waitress seemed angry the entire dinner. She smirked once after asking how our gluten-free bread was, as if making fun of the choice. Hopefully it was just an off night for her!"}
{"text":"I adore Spinato's! I was introduced to them by a coworker and I have been hooked ever since. My personal favorite is the spaghetti calzone. The personal size is more then enough, but I can down the larger sizes like no body's business!   What seals the deal with the 5 stars is the service. I have NEVER had a bad experience. The staff is wonderful whether you dine-in or takeout. We were eating there just this weekend and I was amazed at how well they work together. If someone sees your drink empty, they will fill it up, even if it isn't there table or section. On your way out, so many people Thank you and wish you a good evening. The staff is amazing and it really shows!"}
{"text":"I really dig This place :))) I come in - sit @the bar and am so comfy and know things are about to be so good. This is one of my go to places when i need to forget my day and just relax. The food is yummy and there is no place like it i have found in the Valley. Is it traditional - No. Is it tasty and awesome YES.   I got introduced to spinato\"s through my bestie and have never turned back :) now first do not miss the cheesy garlic bread - usually cheesy bread is a filler - here with a trio of Meatballs in the Awesome Vodka Sauce it is a Meal! (both on the Happy Hr menu) it is THE BEST CHEESY BREAD IN TOWN!  With that said...  The Pizza is Great! I love the Traditional veggie or Nicole's special - BUT KNOW ALLLLL THE PIZZA IS AMAZING! now if your not a Thin Crust person - you just let them know and they can do your pizza Deep Dish Chicago Style - also AMAZING. I prefer the Vodka Sauce always FYI :)))  The Entire Menu is fun and tasty - so many not miss\"s  like the spaghetti calzone and the meatball sub - or the crazy fun salads and yummy cannoli\"s  - and do not miss WINE WEDNESDAY! So Yeah i really like this place :) so will you!  Why 4 stars not 5 - nothing to do with the food - i do wish they would deliver to my house :/ they will deliver to business by me but not my house. Second- they took away Diet Dr.pepper - not cool. WE ALL WANT IT BACK. :)"}
{"text":"A great family-owned and operated neighborhood pizza place, Spinato's has a really sweet sauce on their pies that I cant get enough of. Square cut pizza is always easier to share with the family too. Eat-in or takeout service is always top-notch."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place, not like but love!!!! I have been to Spinatos plenty of times an it is always so good. I decided to have my dads 55th birthday celebration here. As my family and I arrived we asked for a table to seat 12 since we were unable to make reservations. The wait was not long at all and to our surprise they seated in a separate room from all the commotion.   As we were greeted by our waitress she began to take our orders for drinks. The waitress was very nice and offered suggestions on what happy hour items they had available. We started with the boneless buffalo wings which were great. For our main dish we ordered the get meaty and a couple more orders of the wings and a calzone. Everyone in our party had a great time and the waitress was so nice and attentive.   If you are looking to have a party here make sure someone comes a little early to get a table because they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is absolutely amazing. One of the best pizzas or the best pizza I've ever tasted. I ate til I was miserable.."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to do it, I have to amend my original review and take a way a couple of stars from Spinato's.  I am very upset to learn that I have been mis-informed several times by their managers about certain items on the menu being gluten free.  Originally, I was told by their manager that all bone-in wings were gluten free because they had their own dedicated fryer.  Shortly after that, a delivery guy informed us my favorite wings, the spicey chili, were not gluten free.  The manager I spoke to about that informed me only certain sauces were gluten free, mild, medium and hot.  I ordered some pizza and wings this past weekend.  I was called & informed that none of their wings have ever been gluten free, that they have never had a dedicated fryer.  Shame on Spinato's for mis-informing me on several occasions and jeopardizing my health, and anyone else's with an allergy, in the process.  Some things I was told were completely false.  I immediately attempted to contact their corporate office about this & asked them to consider re-training for their staff and managers.  I have not received any response or apology from them.  I am removing them from my gluten free favorites list and will be giving it some serious thought as to whether or not I want to order from them in the future."}
{"text":"I had a hungry family of 12 visiting from out of town and decided to try this place based on their Yep (Yelp Rep). They delivered big time. The pizzas arrived at my door on time and hot. We ordered 'da greek' and it got rave reviews from everybody. I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite and go to pizza place!! I love their pizza so much that I have not branched out to try anything else yet, even though I want to, but my boyfriend loves their wings and says their hot wings are one of the best also!! I only had one \"bad\" experience, delivery, that they were running behind on and my pizza took way lknger than anticipated but the manager, Janelle, personally called me to apologize and let me know that she added money to my account for my next meal to be on them. I was very pleased with how she handled the situation and how nice and professional she was. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, super great calzone. I went with the baked spaghetti calzone which was a friends recommendation and it was really good. The 7' was the perfect size for me."}
{"text":"My second favorite pizza place to go to when I'm craving for pizza.. I got first introduced to it few years ago when I'll come visit my sister here in phx and she took me to spinatos with her room mates... one thing that I like living close to this location is that they deliver .. love their thin crust pizza... u can never go wrong with anything that u order from here"}
{"text":"This is where my husband and I go when neither of us want to cook and we want good food.  I love their la italliana pizza and my husband loves the meaty ones.  Their antipasto salad is also delish.  I love the service here too - a small town local kind of place tucked in a little shopping center.  We mostly get takeout here but we've eaten in a few times and the dining atmosphere is great.  Always very pleasant people here in great moods because the food is incredible.  I don't know what they put in their sauce but there must be some sort of crack in it because it's super addicting.  We always come back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is reminiscent of Pizano's Pizza in Chicago, my favorite pizza of all time. It's not quite at Pizano's level, but it beats flying back to Chicago for pizza, and it's really close, the closest I've ever had. If you love Pizano's, make a beeline to this establishment and get the thin crust, amazing."}
{"text":"First time there and was impressed. A couple craft beers on the menu and some decent wines. We were seated immediately on a Friday night. The staff is impeccable and attentive. The appetizer of bruschetta came quickly. Also had a few meatballs. At .89 cents a piece they are steal and very good. The bruschetta was fresh and perfect. It's a big plate. You can read a hundred reviews that says the pizza is excellent. It is. Loaded up on a semi-thin crust, it is delicious. The sauce is sweet but not overpowering. The pizza to try however is not on the menu. It is a creation by the bartender and a frequent patron. They call it \"The Super Dickey\" and it is incredible. We were offered a slice and seriously fought over the last morsel . It is a meatball/ ricotta/sweet pepper/onion pizza that with their homemade crust and sauce melts in you mouth. Ask for it.  My only complaint was that it was abnormally loud in the small place. Almost to the point we could not hear each other at times. Have plans to return soon. They do not serve any fried foods, no wings, no deep fried mushrooms. They focus on pizza and do an incredible job at it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been to Spinato's many many times and always sit at the bar.  Our last 2 experiences were not good.  One time, not the correct items on the pizza and a week ago, the pizza was so soggy and loaded with cheese, we told the bartender it was not good, but that we were going to eat pieces on the outside because we were starving.  Could not even take leftovers home because it was so disgusting.  Too inconsistent."}
{"text":"Best pizza that I have had in Arizona after living here for 3 years now. Solid happy hour and dope environment!"}
{"text":"The food is good--nothing special--however, the service is great and the 7th Street location is just a couple of blocks away from our home.  We have eaten there several times, and dined late on New Year's Eve the year it opened...very nice experience!"}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatball calzone was genius. Would have likes more sauce in the calzone but maybe I didn't order  it properly. The thin crust pizza was very good reminded me of Donato's back in Indy. Would definitely go again this was a pick up order will try in restaurant next time. ."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in AZ, hands down!  This location is the best of the bunch but can get crowded.  Has a nice bar area and is a lot more spacious than the Tempe location.  They also have the full menu here (unlike Tempe) even though we usually just stick with the pizza, it is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Spinato's makes me angry. Not because the food is bad. Not because the servers are bad.  Because they are never open!! Their hours are crazy! I just can't seem to get them down. They used to be open for lunch, now they're not. They used to be open on Mondays, now they're not.  I'm so confused.  Every time my friends and I get in the car to go have lunch at Spinato's, low and behold, they're closed! What the heck!  The times I have eaten there though, the pizza was really good. The salad was pretty tasty too and the ice was fabu. They have that really great crushed ice that no one has anymore.  If you're not sure what I'm talking about, order a soda. Trust me, you'll love that ice.  I've tried the pasta and wasn't impressed. It was bland and boring, but it came with garlic bread.  If you can catch Spinato's when they're open, definitely have a meal and see what you think!"}
{"text":"Food and staff always great! Dinner with a baby is not always easy but the staff were kind thoughtful and even gave our baby a cute baby spinatos tee! Love this place and love how they are family friendly!"}
{"text":"I have good and bad with this one. The food is good, but it can get very expensive for what you are getting. I find i get better service sitting in the bar area over the main dining area. The pizza is delicious! The bartenders personable and attentive."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza hands down! My top choice is Da Greek, and my second is Mama's Other Signature. Get the crust extra crispy and it won't get soggy, even if you take it to go. Just takes a few extra minutes to cook. It's a thin crust and the extra crunch makes it sooooo good.  Don't get the gluten free though - I tried that once and it was like chewy cardboard. They have a great happy hour from 3-6pm everyday. $9 small specialty pizzas and house wine for $4!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I don't engage in the debate of Chicago deep-dish v. New York slices, thin crust v. Sicilian, etc.  Pizza is just delicious, and when you find a good one, it's not worth splitting hairs to decide which is best - just enjoy what you got.  As for me, having a soft spot for Neopolitan and Chicago-style pizzas, coming here this last trip was my first pizza experience here, though not my first time here.  The dish that gets me going here I'll get to later.  Wife ordered the Mama Spinato's, thin crust.  Brought her here because I told her she HAD to try the sauce.  She has become a believer.  So this is a spinach and tomato pizza, pretty basic.  What makes it so delicious though, apart from the sauce, is the garlic.  Lots of it.  If you're garlic-averse, don't get this pizza, otherwise, wrap your arms around it and embrace.  I think it would do better with the thicker Sicilian crust, but that choice wasn't up to me.  The kick of the garlic, along with the sweet-saltiness of the sauce and the mellowness of the cheese and spinach made for great balance.  A solid pizza.  But here's why I really love this place, apart from the sauce.  It's the dish i get almost every time I come here.  Baked spaghetti calzone.  Carb heaven.  It is, simply, marinara sauced spaghetti baked inside a calzone shell, covered in more sauce.  The noodles come out super al dente from the extra baking and all that sauce brings flavor to the otherwise plain crust you get from the calzone shell.  You can opt to add ricotta, which I tend not to do - it tends to take away from he taste of the sauce.  But if that's what you're looking for, adding ricotta could be a good option for you.  Also have the option of adding sausage.  I also skip this typically.  The couple times I've ordered it before, it is really minimal sausage.  Crumbles, really.  And for the price, it's just not good value.  On a side note, I appreciate their attention to detail.  Both the calzone and thin crust pizza came out on wire racks to keep the crusts crispy.  Bonus points.  So come for the sauce, stay for the baked spaghetti calzone.  The pizza is solid too and if the Mama Spinato is any indication, then your pizza order should be in good hands."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the calzone vegan ized with spaghetti and marinara , we often dine in or often order curbside or a third party delivery service. Usually consists of the same order, a couple calzones and a large pizza. Whenever we dined in the last few times our large groups of 7 or more are provided complimentary bread while we wait for apps and food. We assume when placing orders for the same amount of people but for Togo that we'd be treated with the same courtesy on $60 orders.  Not the case and very disappointing as most places simply get this complimentary common courtesy especially when with large hungry groups spending a decent amount, a repetitive large hungry group at that.    Also was not offered my receipt for cash take out order."}
{"text":"Nice service, was seated fairly promptly. We had a pleasant waitress.  We ordered the Mamma's Signature Calzone, that is $18.00.   And it is supposed to feed 6 people.  Come on!!  No way is that feeding six.  Perhaps one very hungry person, or a couple, like we were.  It is a 16\" pizza, folded over, and cut into 8 pieces.  But it is a very thin crust pizza. Also, the fresh spinach, is frozen, and I was hoping for a lot more garlic, than the little bit that was tasted.  Sauce is too sweet, for my taste. Pomegranate tea (unsweetened) was ok, tasted watered down. This was our first time here."}
{"text":"Good pizza - if you like sickening sweet sauce.  Yelpers, you seriously are high to give this joint anything over 2 stars.  Family friendly and family owned gets one star, maybe another star for homemade sausage, but that's about it.  $23 later and I feel like I had a Tombstone pizza with Prego sauce.  The garlic was foodservice pre-minced crap?  How difficult is it to chop some garlic?    Do yourself a favor - avoid and have a real pie.  No need risking Type II Diabetes from dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location many, many times always being very satisfied and coming back for more.  Last night however was a different experience.  We started with two appetizers: stuffed mushrooms and artichoke toast both of which were lukewarm and extremely salty.  My husband and I for our entrees got two separate calzones both of switch were delicious.  We ended the meal with an apple cobbler for dessert that was also gross.  It was way different from the apple cobble we have had in the past, super dry, not tasty and overall just bad.  Our waiter to top it off was a dud.  The rest of the staff was excellent and helped more than our waiter himself.  It wasn't until he brought the dessert that he asked if we needed more drinks, rarely came to our table and was annoyed when he had to clean up a spill on the floor that I had already started to clean up myself."}
{"text":"We love Spinato's pizza and the service is usually good. This time we were seated at a table in the bar and it was quite noisy in that area. Our server could have been more attentive as well. I provided a detailed rating at https://www.serviceguru.com/business/spinatospizzeria  Our Greek salad had a lot of dressing on it compared to other visits as well. We let our server know and they said they'd alert the kitchen but we were not offered a new salad or a solution unfortunately."}
{"text":"Simply awesome food, great pizza and super friendly staff! Maria is awesome as well!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken pesto pizza. The crust has good texture and flavor. I like how they put the pizza on a cooling rack to keep the crust from getting soggy. The presto sauce and artichoke hearts lacked flavor. The service was not the greatest. We ordered some wings and put the bones on our plates. When our pizza came out the server didn't ask us if we needed new plates or take the plates with the bones on them."}
{"text":"The amazing customer service is always consistent. The customer service compliments the food, perfect! Definitely far from a chain restaurant, this place gives me reason to support local family owned businesses. I showed up with a party of 9 (on a sunday night 6pm) and was seated in less than 5 minutes. The only thing that was poor service was our server on refilling drinks. Other than that I had a place, the atmosphere is upscale without the expensive prices. They have a HUGE bar and patio."}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider this Chicago-style pizza, but it's good. We were impressed that they had gluten-free pizza which is great for those with allergies. Two times ago, there was too much garlic on the pizza and we told the manager. It was scraped off on the side of the plate in 6 large mounds. The sauce is sweeter than what we're used to, but it's good. We don't like the salads, in any way, shape, or form. They are plain and bland and costly for what you get. The staff welcomes you promptly and the bartenders are polite and helpful. This is a small place, and sometimes there is a wait. I agree with the other yelper that said the pizza can get soggy if you do takeout. It comes out nice and hot, so we open the boxes in the car to help keep moisture at a minimum. It's warm when we get home but that's better than soggy. We like it here a lot."}
{"text":"Visiting from Southern California and dropped in for a bite.  Had a few things from the Happy Hour menu, one of which was a garlic and mushroom pizza.  I have to say that this pizza was the BEST pizza I have ever tasted!  Thin crust and cheesy cheese, the kind that stretches for miles.  Wow, I wish I could find a Spinato's closer to home!!!"}
{"text":"Spinato's equals FABULOUS!  It is by far my favorite pizza in the valley.  It is a great place to go with the family or with a large group.  However, it is not your typical pizza.  The sauce tastes fresh and has something extra in it that gives it an almost addicting flavor.  I prefer the \"thin crust\" which is still on the thick side.  We always order extra for a tasty leftover treat the next day.  For a pizza place, Spinato's did not ignore the importance of having a full bar with great glassware.  Our favorite waiter is by far, BOBBY C.!!!  He is a character and a half and always makes our Spinato's dining experience entertaining and fun!  He also knows a thing or two about wine too!.   They do not take reservations and the wait can be quite long on a weekend night.  However, the pizza is worth the wait and will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great salads and great service.  Wanted pizza and someplace close to the hotel, so we chose Spinato's over several hipster pizza joints.  We made the right choice.  They have a ton of toppings to choose from.  We went with \"Nicole's New Favorite\" and added sausage. It was excellent, great crust and cooked to perfection.  We got there an hour before closing and got great service from our waitress, Alex."}
{"text":"The service was great, and it's a hip/happening place. I am always looking for a great Gluten Free pizza option. Their GF crust was ok, but not the best I've had. I will return, as it's easy to order take away and friendly people."}
{"text":"Walking inside you see a bar that you can eat at, but upon further inspection the restaurant is very quaint. The smell of the food hits you in the face as you walk inside and it smells amazing. I happened to get Diana as a waitress and she was awesome very friendly and professional. I got the stuffed mushrooms and they were to die for, a must get appetizer before you start the meal. It comes with seven good size mushrooms enough for two, eating them I just wanted the whole plate to myself. I ordered the baked spaghetti calzone with the vodka cream sauce and my significant other ordered the mama signature calzone. We split both of the halves and the baked spaghetti with the sauce was delicious, it was more savory and very heartwarming. The mamas signature is a must of you are a garlic lover, it is absolutely refreshing and sweet and easy on the taste buds and not over filling. Overall dinner was very tasteful. They also do military discounts for any of you military folks out there. Definitely coming back again next time i'll try and save room for desert"}
{"text":"I held my 30th birthday celebration at Spinato's, based in large part on the fact that they have seating adequate for 12 people, and because I've dined here before and enjoy the food. Sadly, this experience was not acceptable and I won't soon forget about it.  I called Spinato's early in the week attempting to make a reservation, which they do not accept. They said it is first come, first served. I attempted to give them my plans and timing by phone when I called to serve as a warning to be prepared for a large group, and they refused to write anything down.   I arrived at 12:45pm on Sunday, and told the hostess Maria that I have a party of 12. She asked for 20 minutes to have the seating ready. Sounds good so far! Well, it took nearly 90 minutes before we were seated. The manager on duty, Bobby, came to apologize for the wait and say we would be seated within 10 minutes, and that they were opening up the extended seating in the private room. Those 10 minutes passed and we still weren't seated. My two friends were having drinks in the bar area, and noticed lots of table space available that we could have been seated at, but the tables were not clean. My friends intervened and asked the staff to clean their tables and please seat us. So the private dining area never happened, and we were seated in the bar area.  Then there was the service. The restaurant was by no means packed. And I think our server was simply overwhelmed; perhaps she was covering too many tables.  Refill service on beverages was virtually non-existent. Our table was not being well monitored. Then one of my guests had a huge hair in her pasta dish. Food was brought out in three waves - so it was at least 10 minutes before everyone had their food. Attention to detail was not an area of concern at the restaurant, this time.  My food was fine, and Bobby comped my meal due to the bad experience (without me asking for a comp). I'm not a chronic complainer - I was going to keep my mouth shut. He was apologetic but said \"we were just slammed\". Instead of blaming this terrible experience on being slammed (which visually was not the case), why not just admit we failed to meet your expectations and we are genuinely sorry? I don't want to hear why you think this all went downhill - just be accountable and don't assign fault to any single cause. Because this was a failure on every front.   I'm deeply saddened by this experience. I went here to have a great time to celebrate 30 years of life, and now I'm left with memories of a really bad dining experience. I live right around the corner, but I think I'm done with Spinato's.  You've significantly failed to meet the expectations of your guests. It's a shame you were clearly ill prepared and didn't seem to care a great deal. Apologies are easy to give verbally, but the service never improved after they were made. Actions speak far louder than words.  Suggestions: 1. Reconsider your policy on reservations - it will help you plan for large groups and not be in disarray when a dozen people show up. 2. Staff appropriately. Don't stretch your servers too thin. 3. Hair nets and hats in the kitchen for all staff handling food. 4. Pay attention to detail. Entrees should all arrive simultaneously (or close to it). 5. When things go terribly wrong, take ultimate accountability. Don't cite the reasons why everything went poorly - just accept responsibility for failing to meet expectations. Your guests aren't concerned with rationale. They just want a good experience."}
{"text":"We had the Sicilian pizza and spaghetti calzone. Good stuff! Their cannoli was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! I love the sauce and thin crust! Had the stuffed mushroom appetizer which was good.  Great service!  Clint was fantastic!  Love coming to Spinatos when we are visiting family in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try a new pizza joint tonight, and we picked Spinato's based on the raving reviews. We ordered the small cheese pizza (thin crust), gluten free garlic bread, and the Italian beef sandwich for take-out.  The bill came to about $30. When we got home, we opened the box with the $5 garlic bread... It was literally half of a hot dog bun! The sandwich was also incredibly small. While flavorful, it wasn't worth $8.99. The pizza was mediocre at best, soggy crust and the sauce was too sweet for my taste.  Overall, the food was less than average but for a higher than average price. I'll stick with Ray's and Redendo's from now on for my pizza. I added a star because of the girl who took our order, who was pleasant and polite and provided good customer service."}
{"text":"Such a poor experience ... seated in the bar at a small table that was so awkward ... the servers brushed my chair every couple of minutes on one side on the other side the view of 3 very loud very drunk men's butts ... our server Clint was difficult to understand and breezed by sliding soda on the table ... apparently his other tables were more important that he couldn't take a second to place the glass on the table.  The Wrigley sandwich was bland ... and disappointing"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA!!!  WE LOVE COMING HERE! They definitely have the best Bloody Marys great pizza sauce and super friendly staff!  Definitely my favorite pizza in town!"}
{"text":"The Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is the most amazing pizza I have ever had.  I don't even put it in the same catagory as regular pizza.  We can order peperoni pizza or what ever from any place.  But the Mama Spinato's Signiture pizza is speacial, it's like hambergers vs steak.  I love pizza but this place takes it to a whole new level.  Lucky me there is one by the house and by my work."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! I love \"mama's spinach pizza\" and I never would order something like this usually. But everything about it is exactly right. One thing unique about their pizza is their sauce. It's got some sweetness to it--nothing overpowering, just an undertone, but I think some people might not like it. Some other things to try are the meatball appetizer, the Greek salad, and the spaghetti calzone.   Note that there are several locations and they are not created equally. The one is Tempe is really small with only a handful of tables. The one in Phoenix on 7th is huge but it's really missing the \"family pizzeria\" feel. This location on Bell is the best. Plenty of tables, including a great patio, friendly staff, and consistent food you can count on"}

{"text":"Spinatos is one of my favorite pizza places. The mama's signature is the best. We frequently add sausage and various meats to it!   Their Cesar salad is good. The dressing isn't too overwhelming.   I haven't tried many other things on the menu, except a few appetizers. But everything has always been great.   The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Got there right at opening time and seated at the bar area where the bartender was our waiter .  He was so distracted he forgot to place our order.  One hour later the pizza came out. You have to eat it with A fork because it's soupy. Not an enjoyable experience"}

{"text":"Worst pizza ever !!!!!  The crust is pale and soft WHY WHY WHY!!!   Crust should have some color please God what are they thinking ???? The sauce oh so horrrible and sweet SUGAR DOES NOT GO IN THE PIZZA SAUCE , do you people know anything ???? And back to the crust it really is that bad there's supposed to be an outer ridge of crunchy and chewy dough I think you guys cut off the edge just to fuck with me like everyone else get a normal pizza but you gave me the pie the retarded dishwasher made .......I have no idea how you are still in business"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Great food and beer options. I don't eat pizza often but if I do it's usually from here. Or there sandwiches as well. Sandwiches are really good."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and it is consistently great. The trio of meatballs is delicious. The calzones are ooey gooey cheesy perfection. The normal order is a pepperoni and cheese pizza. My wife is from the Midwest and loves Donato's, which also does square cut slices, and she has now found a new love out here! Spinatos the magnificent!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a 'decent' pizza as we had recently been to Organ Stop pizza with our NOMADS group.  (The pizza there is [I think] frozen and then just run through the oven).  I had a personal size thin crust with sausage and pineapple which was pretty decent.  My wife had the Italian sausage Florentine with a garlic Alfredo sauce which was quite tasty.  It was still during 'Happy Hour' so I had a glass of the House red wine (a red blend of Northern AZ).  Nice blend of grapes, tannins and a great finish.  Jean ordered a Margarita but had to send it back as she did not care for the flavor at all.  I took a sip and agreed with her.  Not attractive at all.  We had a bit of a wait (about 30 minutes) but not too bad for a Sat night.  Seems they may have been a bit short handed as there was a company Christmas party going on just as we arrived.  So I can only surmise that added to the slow service as well.  All in all, it was a pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"Great service/great food!!!! Did I mention the pie???? Manager Tim stopped by to make sure everything was great. Don't forget the pie! Btw: don't forget the pie."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill this use to be the goto place for the neighborhood for pizzas and sandwiches now it's basically a take out counter. If there is no service and attention to the customer what is the point might as well call in an order and do take out  I went in for lunch and it was a ghost town i had to request the check when my food came so i didn't have to go into the kitchen and wave someone down to get service and my check"}
{"text":"My husband just picked up his favorite pizza, sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce with his birthday discount, thank you. But we wanted to know if you changed your cheese? The pizza was missing its extra sauce and cheese seemed different. Please don't change the formula, it was much better before."}
{"text":"If you want a great family restaurant when you visit Phoenix offering superior pizza and salad, visit Spinatos. Great sauce, Great atmosphere, and very economical for a family. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Spinato's since my son was in a high chair. He has loved their pizza and we love the salads.  The best pizza is the \"Get Meaty\" and the Greek Salad is really delicious. We do family style and share it all. Madison has been working at Spinatos since we started eating there (at the old location) and she is always a breath of fresh air. I love her warm greetings and sincere interest in our lives. She represents everything that is good about Spinato's - a family first restaurant with wonderful food and service."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Amazing food, friendly and fast service, and a really great menu with lots of fantastic Italian favorites. Also, they have Pepsi products!!!! Hooray! I got the Italian sub sandwich and the hubs for a little personal pizza, both of which were cooked perfectly! Gooey cheese, crispy bread, and yummy, warm Italian cured meats!"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing...especially Phil, their asst. manager!"}
{"text":"I have heard the name Spinato's for a very long time, so on a whim I checked it out.  All in all I have no complaints of the place. The service was quick and friendly, meals were delicious and decently priced, and the atmosphere and overall experience was on point.  I ordered the Mama's Signature pizza, cause that what the menu told me to do, and it was not a disappointment. It was hard for me to say wether I was super hungry on this day or it was that delicious, but I could have killed this large pizza on my own, sadly I had to share with the family.  Oh, I also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip appetizer, fully expecting it to be a bowl of dip and some chips, but it came with, what I believe was pizza dough chips. Definitely a great addition to an already good appetizer.  Great place, family friendly, an all around enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town! We have only been here once but we will definitely be back for our next pizza fix.   Whatever pizza you choose, I recommend the thin crust. We got a Super Six thin crust and a Sicilian pepperoni. The Sicilian was good but it was a bit too much bread for my liking (I prefer more toppings in a bite than bread). The Super Six was omg delish and their pepperoni was executed better than any pepperoni pizza I've seen with a drizzle of delicious marinara on top.   We are definitely sold on this hot spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I love the pizza at Spinato's. That said, I find it difficult to return to the restaurant. They have been understaffed the last three times I went in the evening and once at lunchtime. We are kept waiting for a seat, \"so the servers can catch up\". The place had four tables occupied, the last time we were there. I understand people calling in, and  not showing up, but this is to the point of being suspicious. They need to get their act together. Not the way to run a business."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences that we have had.  Came in hungry, left very hungry!! We waited several minutes to even be acknowledged by our server.  In fact another server came by to ask if we had been acknowledged and he got our drink order. Then our server showed up, she asked to take drink order told her that it had been taken and she walks away. Server brings back drinks, takes our order( very nice while taking order), ordered appetizer and salad and they came out fairly quickly. Strawberry Gorgonzola salad was good size and tasted good!  Spinach artichoke was just warm but tasted good.  We waited another 20 minutes for another personal pizza to come out. Again just warm. In this time we chomped on ice as our drinks were empty. Our calzone came out after our daughter was completely done with her pizza. While bringing our calzone, Server asks our daughter If she wants dessert, what??? Calzone, was cold inside, we couldn't believe it!  We waited 50 minutes for cold food.  We told our server to please take it away, and spoke with the manager. Unfortunately, experience was complete ruined by this time.  Such a shame!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've found since migrating from Chicago 17 years ago! The staff is amazing - Quality is consistent and prices are fairly reasonable!  The Bell Road Location has the best service and is so convenient - as we live in New River - close to NOTHING! LOL  Truly recommend this place for Chicago transplants!  - THIS is what good food is all about!!!"}
{"text":"Good location, exceptional service and food. Maria was our waiter and was helpful with quick. She also has a great sense of humor. The food was excellent. The stuffed mushrooms were cooked well and the cheese blended perfectly. The bread with mozzarella was great as was the Sicilian crust pizza my girl and I shared. My girl's mom got the 4 cheese ravioli topped with vodka sauce and she said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in town. The dough is perfection for both the Sicilian and thin crust varieties. The sauce is the key ingredient as it has a delicious sweet side to it. You need to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service. Location isn't bad either. The store is clean and the staff is accommodating. The only reason for me not rating with 5 stars is because the salad was soggy. I will come back though because of the melt in your mouth pizza, and awesome service."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Sunday. I got the gluten free pizza and it was absolutely the best GF crust I've tasted. They get it from the Gluten Free Creations Bakery which is local. It is seasoned with rosemary and so delicious! Prices were reasonable, staff was very friendly and I would certainly recommend it and will definitely become a regular customer."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. The food here is pretty consistent (never terrible) and the service is where sometimes it's lacking. I wouldn't say it's do to bad servers but moreso due to having so many tables, the servers are overworked. My go to is the chicken parmesan with all it's caloric goodness. Their drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best bang for your buck at happy hour...the $3 meatball trio is a must. On Mondays they have happy hour drink prices all day.  Their pizza is, hands down, the best I've had in the Valley. I hail from Chicago, so I know a thing or two about pie.  We've been to various locations...all with nice decor and the same excellent food!"}
{"text":"I've been to about every pizza parlor in town and for me, Spinato's has the best pizza in town.    Nice thin crisp crust, a sweet sauce which i prefer, great tasting pepperoni, cold cold beer, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Our Da Greek pizza was among the best pizza I've had. We dined outside at lunch time on a recent Tuesday.  We had the outdoor patio to ourselves, while another party dined inside."}
{"text":"Pizza is still good but has gotten greasy(ier) over the recent past.  Sauce is great."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. 90% consistent. Ken a great host when he's there. Their other menu items excellent too."}
{"text":"First time here, it was loud inside so we asked for the patio. I faced the restaurant it was nice, however my son faced the parking lot and mentioned he felt like we were sitting in the lot.  Service was quick and professional.  Kept our drinks/water full.  I ordered the spinach calzone added sausage. It was delicious.  My son ordered the shrimp pasta.  He ate every bit.  Portion size was perfect. Brownie desert wasn't anything to brag about.  We will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Pizza. Spinach and mushroom with extra marinara.  I had this exact same pizza at one of their other locations that was one of the best pizza's I have ever had. This one was bad. Very bland and the quality just seemed subpar. Service was ok. Causal attire nice Italian ambience."}
{"text":"You know you are at a great restaurant when your appetizer salad is amazing and when there is a mistake on your food the management comes over to apologize. I loved this place and with amazing food and excellent service very much recommend this restaurant.  If you are gluten free and love Italian food this might be heaven."}
{"text":"Love Spinato's! Eat it all the time. If you think it's not good you probably ordered wrong. :-) We always order the thick crust with garlic, feta, salami, italian beef and basil. Toppings are ALWAYS plentiful. If you think the sauce is too sweet (which I don't) try adding garlic, feta, even a little sprinkle of salt. This pizza is to die for! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm a NY-style pizza lover, so this super-sweet sauce freaked me out.  Nothing else about the pizza was good enough to come back. I'm not getting all the hype."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town IMO (I'm not a fan of the Grimaldis chain). My faovrite dish is the ham and salami calzone. And like another reviewer said, great crushed iced - it really does make a difference. Food did take a long time and usually when I'm in the area I don't have that much time top stop in - really need to remember to call ahead to order take out."}
{"text":"This place is great!  My girlfriend and I came here for the first time to check it out since we had a gift card.  We came in later on a Friday and were seated right away.  Our server, Bri, was awesome and very attentive.  Being in the service industry myself, I appreciated the good service.  We tried a couple of the appetizers.  The meatball trio was delicious and the caprese stack was excellent.  We then built our own thin crust pizza which was amazing.  They have daily specials and I tried one of the expresso after dinner drinks that was pretty good.  Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely go back again soon.  i recommend checking this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Not sure about some of the reveiws that talk about bad service or mediocre pizza...... We were seated after a short wait on a Saturday evening and our waiter checked on us every few minutes without being intrusive...... We ordered two different kinds of Pizza and one Calzone and all three were excellent........  The biggest negative was that I ate WAY more than I should have!!!!"}
{"text":"Spinato's pizza is like crack pizza: super addictive, delicious, and hard to put down. What makes Spinato's pizza the best in the Valley is that it addresses the common complaints of pizza lovers everywhere, and just kills it: - Man I wish there was more sauce on this pizza! - Spinato's puts a loving extra drizzle of sauce on top of it's pizza. - Man this pizza is too thin, it's like I'm eating cardboard - Spinato's creates a deep dish pizza, not as thick as Chicago style, but hefty enough to be filling and doughy. - Man these pizza toppings are overcooked, not fresh - Spinato's takes the time to put in quality ingredients, with the right amount of tasty proportions.  Spinato's combination of doing everything well ultimately results in some of the best pizza out there. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Spinato's on Bell but wanted to try this one out to compare. I love Spinato's pizza because the sauce is sweet and plentiful, and the slices are thick and hearty. I can always count on dining on delicious pizza and this one did not disappoint.  Besides the pizza we ordered the artichokes and stuffed mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms are absolutely divine and it is like having mouth watering cheesy bits of heaven in your mouth! I recommend ordering both but if you order a large pizza be sure you will have leftovers to make into midnight pizza snacks!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is the gluten free pizza. They also have a very yummy gluten free garlic bread. The house salad is tasty and dressing is gluten free as well. I love coming here because of the gluten free options and they are delicious! They also have a lot of other tasty options such as pasta and calzones(which I cannot eat, but for those of you that do eat gluten). I've been happy every time I've come here and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The strawberry spinach salad and pizza were fantastic, but the really star of the 5 star review was our server Moe. She was absolutely *heroic* helping us today.  My four year old had to urgently go potty while my 2 year old was eating her pizza... Moe jumped in like a ninja and kept my daughter happily entertained while my son completed his nature call with daddy.  Awesome.  That's service above-and-beyond!"}
{"text":"Overall the best pizza I've had my life! Apizza Scholls in Portland, which claims to be the best, has nothing on this place. We got one of the meat pizzas and one of the pizzas with pesto as a base. It's thin crust but still completely worth it! The flavors are just magnificent! I remember tasting the artichokes and the chicken in the pesto and all of the meat, and all of the goodness! It is just thoroughly worth it to try this place out. They have a couple of very nondescript locations but definitely worth it! Phoenix is overrun with pizza places but this one is definitely the best in my opinion! I can't stress that enough!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a neighborhood pizza joint? Have no fear... the decision is clear! Spinatos is the place to go for great pizza. I order take out here once every two weeks at least.   I usually order a personal size pepperoni pizza with extra sauce. What makes Spinatos unique? It's all in the sauce, they have a very distinct sweet sauce. I haven't had any pizza like it. On lighter nights I will order the entree Caesar Salad. I personally think they should lower the price on the salad for what you get, but I'm not complaining. This time around I got adventurous and ordered the Butternut Squash and Brussel Sprout Penne. I thought it was good and lived up to the name, but it needed a little acid to tie the dish together.   Overall, this place has been my go to pizza spot for 5 years and will continue to be for many years. :0)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good quick service this place is not for you. I went to this location with a group of co-workers today for lunch and had the worse service I have ever had. We ordered 2 salads 2 personal pizzas 2 small pizzas and a medium pizza with drinks and it took us forever. There were several issues that came up while we were there. The first was when our waitress Michelle took our drink order and it took 20 minutes to get our drinks and they were delivered by someone else. Then we had our orders taken and we waited another 20 minutes and still got nothing. Our waitress finally came over and told us there was some sort of mix up and re-took a couple of orders. As we sat there people came in ordered and got food and we still had no food. When the food finally came out everyone got theirs except for me. A few minutes later the waitress came out with a pizza and said \"sorry the cook is struggling and put the wrong toppings on your pizza because its his birthday\" So because it was the cooks \"birthday\" our food took an hour and my pizza was made wrong, I couldn't believe it. I told her I didn't want the pizza that she brought that had only Jalapeno's on it and that I would wait for mine. My coworkers took the Jalapeno pizza and I continued to wait. As everyone else ate their food I sat and waited and waited some more. Long story short the pizza came out I immediately got a box and told her we needed to leave. It still took her a long time to get our checks for us (mine was free because of the issue). When getting our checks our waitress said that she was bringing them to us because I let her know that we needed to leave and one of my co-workers replied that we needed to leave an hour ago. She was very sassy and said because its Christmas time they are very busy. Instead of just apologizing and being nice she used another excuse. After all was said and done we wasted 2 hours of our time, we had no drink refills, and the pizza was just OK.  My co-workers and I will not come to this Spinato's again."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that I love the Spinatos at 7th st and Missouri. I have been ordering pizzas there since 2005. Started when they were at 12th st and Glendale. I happened to be up further north this weekend and raved about Spinatos for an hour before my friends decided to order from there and go pick it up.  I was severely disappointed with what we got.  If you could throw a hunk of bread, smear it with sauce and meat... then over cook it... that is what we got. When I went to pick it up, I noticed that there were several people also in there picking up, so maybe they were just really busy.  I was told that my pizza was going to be about ten more minutes.  It could have spared the ten minutes. It was dry, and basically burnt.  I felt so bad for my friends because I had talked up Spinatos for so long and they were severely disappointed.  I will go back to 7th and Missouri, but unfortunately the one on Bell is simply not the same.  I give it two stars for the customer service and courtesy I was given when picking up."}
{"text":"Been to other Spinatos and this one is awful.  Ordered online, easy.  Says pick up in 45 minutes.  Get to Spinatos to pick up and girl can't find online order.  Was looking in wrong spot.  Get Pizza home within 5 minutes and it is COLD.  Wings are COLD.  No Ranch that I ordered.    Open the box and it has plastic on it from a plastic bag.  Because everything is cold I look at the pizza more closely.  It was a full inch smaller than I order.  Yes I measured it, seems like they enjoy mediocrity.  Cheese seems to be lacking, I mean most people won't notice a couple ounces missing, but I do.  I would guesstimate 6 ounces on the 15\" pizza.  And I made only 40-50 pies 6 days a week in high school.  Boss was cheap some employees lackadaisical and it apears to be the same ethics at this Spinatos.  If plastic is on my pizza what kind of quality control is in the kitchen??  Sorely Disappointed and left hungry."}
{"text":"The pizza is quite good, though why they consider it Chicago pizza is a mystery.  Service, however, is rather bad; the servers all seem to be young, earnest, and utterly without management or training.  Someone bring in a professional to manage this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my God this place is so good. A bit pricey but well worth it. Their sauce has changed how I feel about pizza, it took my relationship with this delicacy to the next level lol. When I come here with friends or family I alway get EXCELLENT service, people that work here genuinely like where they work and are very attentive. You can't beat great food and awesome staff."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's! You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorites list goes on... absolute favorites would be garlic bread with cheese (I don't know what they put on it that makes it so amazing), the Da Vinci sandwich, meatball and ricotta spaghetti calzone, super 6 pizza, and any of the pastas! We have been going to this place since I was a kid and it has just gotten bigger and better. Must try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best delivery we have found in this area. Sometimes it takes closer to an hour and a half to deliver. That tells you how awesome they are. Never had a bad pie from these guys!"}
{"text":"Very good Chicago-style thin crust pizza. This was almost 100% the way to true Chicago style bar or tavern style pizza. Flavor of cheese and toppings was authentic and it's square cut with toppings reaching the edge of the pizza crust. The crust itself was the only thing a little lacking. It should be crispy (this was a little soft) and a bit thinner than what they serve here, but that's being picky."}
{"text":"My team and I went here for lunch! Huge space and friendly staff. We shared a large pizza with half Mama Spinato's and half Get Meaty. Excellent pizza served with ranch because we are chubby wubbies. The large pizza was devoured by the 3 of us. I have only been to the one in Tempe and that was years ago so glad there is one in the Chandler/Phx area."}
{"text":"I am a pizza FANATIC - always looking for a good pie. Spinato's is definitely on my list. A friend had given me rave reviews of Spinato's and I finally gave it a try. She had told me not to go with anything fancy - that their best pizza is plain cheese.... PLAIN? \"But what about all the delicious toppings???\" I whined. I'm so glad I listened. We tried half cheese, half pepperoni and everyone agreed that the plain cheese was the best. It allows you to really savor their great crust and signature sauce that has a touch of sweetness to it.   This isn't the place to go if you're looking for a fancy, \"frou frou\" pizza. If you're in the mood for good, solid pizza and a side salad, Spinato's will definitely satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service and hosts! I called at least 2 hours ahead to reserve a table for 10, and I still had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table. After dealing with the unorganised, sassy hosts, We finally sat down and ordered our food. The food took a long time, I do understand that they were busy and we had a large party but almost and hour for a pizza is too long. The pizza was alright, quite soggy and after waiting for almost an hour they got the order wrong! Our waitress was nice but overall it was not a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing! One of our regular places -we come couple times a month, at least.  They've made some changes to the menu in the last couple years but all for the good. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I have no complaints. But I have to say those meatballs are delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent. I ordered the mama Spinato's \"signature\" fresh spinach pizza, the individual sized one. To be completely honest, it was awesome. The flavors worked well together it was a good tasty pizza and I only payed like 8$ or so. It was a great deal and I enjoyed myself.   good pizza, good people, good times."}
{"text":"Great pizza! They never disappoint. If you ever feel like a pizza that goes beyond Pizza Hut, Poppa John's or Costco, then Spinato's is your place. Fresh, hot & good! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Is this Chicago pizza that looks like New York? Or is this New York pizza that claims to hail from Chicago?   Don't get me wrong, the pizza is delicious. I just think it's having a bit of an identity crisis.   There's no traditional Chicago pan pizza here, just thin and thick crust. I've had the thin crust on several occasions and it's outstanding. My favorite pizza is the Super Six: homemade Italian sausage, mozzarella, pepperoni, ham, mushrooms, and mixed green and red sweet bell peppers. Spinato's serves other Italian specialties, but the pizza is the real star.   Another thing (and I realize this might sound silly) is their soft drinks. They are huge and have lots of finely crushed ice. I love that, plus, they are generous with refills.   This place is locally owned with several locations. The owners are from Chicago and use an old family recipe. The staff is incredibly friendly and considerate. Once, when they noticed I was heading back to my car to grab a sweater, they offered to turn off the ceiling fans for me."}
{"text":"I love this place! The caprese is so good! We've been here a few times and the food has always been delicious. The service is great too. Today our server was John. He was very nice. He made sure our kids got their food first. Our 2 year old and 8yr old love it here. Specially since they get Gelato with their kids meal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Impressed with the thin crust style pizza! we ordered the the servers suggestion of mama Spinato Signature fresh spinach, half chicken on left and sausage on right of the pizza.  The hubster and I shared the boneless wings, half hot and sweet. I enjoyed the sweet best. everything was so fresh and delicious and not overly salty. It was a little heavy but very much worth it when your treating yourself. I liked the modern feel of the restaurant.. The service was pleasant and a nice relaxed atmosphere. On tap they have the seasonal san tan mr. pineapple beer, which was unique and I would love to try again. I really don't have more to add except it was amazing pizza."}
{"text":"A NJ girl has a hard time finding great pizza in AZ.  This place is Chicago style but not deep dish like pizzeria UNO.  The sauce is sweet just like i make at home.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful without being to much.  The bruschetta is fantastic!  No reservations so be prepared to wait but it is worth it!  The take and bake option provides a great product without all the standing around."}
{"text":"Love this place. Seriously good pizza! Came with a large party and they seated us right away. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. Had a large spicy Italian pizza, pepperoni, sausage, onions, and fennel seed. The pizza wasn't too spicy, it had just the right kick. Our table also shared a family sized antipasto, it was big enough for a party of 9 to share! The wings were prepared just right as well, not too soggy and drenched with sauce. This will be our go to place for Italian when coming to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Got a Togo order and maybe it's better at the restaurant but the pizza dough was soft and under cooked and the bread sticks were wrapped in this huge tin foil which maybe the very soggy and wet.not worth 26 bucks but like I said it could be better eating there"}
{"text":"We got sat less than an hour before closing. We didn't know they closed at 8pm on Sundays so our bad. Luckily service was still good and food was good. Pizza sauce is definitely on the sweet side so that made them unique. But having toppings like sweet peppers just made it too sweet. We also had the meat lovers and chicken pesto. Pesto was strong and garlicky. I liked it the best. Their antipasti salad was really good too. Overall everything was good. Not sure if I cared for the pizza sauce but everything was good and can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is so crowded, my nephew and I waited for 20 minutes. But it was worth the wait :)) I like the layout to this place. Great vibe and my nephew had a blast here.  He said he liked how there's tv here. Haha fyi, he's ten.  We ordered the basil and tomato bruschetta, as a appetizer.  It was delicious.. my nephew doesn't like tomatoes, but....He sure does now. :) Our entrée, we ordered the mama SIGNATURE with mushroom pizza.  OMGGGG. Oh yes. the sauce on this bad boy was phenomenal, and the baby spinach on top was so goooood. Anddddd the crust. Whoooooooo. Goood job. It was heaven.    the holy cannoli and the cappuccino is a mustttt.  Service was okay. :)  I shall be coming back"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that last night i got delivery from here, and it was an absolute disappointment. Had some friends over to celebrate my promotion, having a few beers.. when i come up with the bright idea to order Spinato's. I feel as if i will pay the extra price to eat there, because as far as quality ingredients.. they have it in the bag.(compared to dominoes or wherever delivers)  Called at exactly 5:55. Didn't end up arriving until 7:43. Which i was a little Hangry about.. Total was $53.00, gave the driver $70. Keep the change.  Open up the pizza, first thing i notice is its terribly smashed to the top on the box. (well at least it's hot) NOT. Like it had been sitting around for quite some time. Open the bruschetta..just some bread, and tomato bits strewn about in some tinfoil. (maybe the mozzarella sticks will be great) Cold. Just like the Super 6 i ordered. Sad day in pizza eating history. I am not sure if regular management was away.. Or they had new management? But i was incredibly disappointed in the feedback i received when i called to complain that i just spent $70 on some Cold,Smashed pizza to be delivered to my house. AND tipped quite well. Bottom line is, if you are thinking about getting a delivery from here, THINK TWICE."}
{"text":"Semi fancy Italian restaurant with sweet pizza sauce. Literally it was sweet. Not a huge fan of it. However they do offer gluten free. You have a choice from thin crust or Sicilian. They have a few signature pizzas and the option to build your own. Plus salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes and more.  Happy hour they offer $3 Coors light in an iced mug , 4 wine, $9 personal pizza and a few other items.  The place was clean the waiters are friendly and attentive.  My son loved the Italian Beef so for him I may return but for me it's all in the sauce and the sauce isn't all that sooooo maybe I'll try a salad."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best pizza I have EVER had. My husband is from back east, and he says this is the best pie he's had out west. Canollis are also GREAT, very authentic and taste just like my grandmother's. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"text":"What a lucky find! We stopped in for supper on Friday night. It didn't look like anything special from the outside, but don't let that fool you!   We had a salami and mushroom calzone, which was amazing! It was just the right ratio of crust to filling, made with quality ingredients, and perfectly cooked! One of those meals that, even though you're super full, you're still sad when you take your last bite!  The staff was very friendly and took wonderful care of us! I would definitely return if I'm ever in the area again!!"}
{"text":"We were there for a party, so i don't know prices.  The servers serving drinks were great and really attentive.  Salad was good.  i didn't think the pizzas were really that great.  For something that was buffet style, it was odd that the tables were positioned so that everyone had to slide in and out of seats (making a row of people move).   Originally they escorted us back past the bathrooms to a really small room, that they later moved a partition so that there was enough room for people to sit down.  It was still really hot, even once we weren't sardined together."}
{"text":"To really appreciate Spinatos, try other places and then get a Mama Gina's Signature Spinach.  Nothing better!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Az, no doubt. I've been dining at Spinatos for year's starting at the 16st n bell location. Now that I'm living in central phx I go to the 7st location. Service and food is ALWAYS on point. If you like Chicago style pizza do yourself a favor and check out Spinatos."}
{"text":"\"The only thing better than carbs, is more carbs.\"?John D  While en route home from the Grand Canyon we were all getting pretty famished, and wanted to pick-up some grub to eat at home. My Sis recommended we give Spinato's Pizzeria (SP) a call because what's better after a long day of sitting on our asses but to carb-load before bed, right? She suggested the Baked Spaghetti Calzone and my BIL wanted his favorite Italian Beef Sandwich. So, I looked them up on my handy-dandy Yelp app, made the call, picked it up and off we went to Piggy Town!  Italian Beef Sandwich- This comes served pretty plain with just some slices of Roasted Italian Beef and Mozzarella melted on top; it also comes with a hot Giardeniera pepper mix and au jus on the side. I wasn't too impressed with this, as I feel I've had better. The baguette was a bit dry, and the meat seemed overcooked. Maybe it's one of those things better eaten-in and might've suffered from the 20 minute ride home?? Either way the au jus and Giardeniera mix helped salvage it. 3*  Baked Spaghetti Calzone- When my sister first suggested this I did the proverbial double-take! You mean they take pizza dough and wrap it around spaghetti, marinara, cheese and sausage?!? This is either genius?or THIS! IS! SPARTA!!!????!! *Ahem* Well, it turns out it's pure genius. Who knew that the best way to serve up carbs was to envelop them in more carbs! Pure carboholics delight, folks... You need this in your life! 5*  Service & Ambiance- I didn't actually go into the restaurant, as this SP has a separate area for pick-up order but the décor seemed to be slightly upscale for a Pizza joint. Service was friendly and the food was being put together as I arrived, so no complaints here. 4*  Value- I actually had to go to their website to look as i don't really remember the prices but it seems to be pretty typical for quality Italian food. Not expensive, but not a bargain. 3.5*   SP provided us with the nice full bellies that we needed at the end of a long week on the road and subpar food. Highly recommended for the Carbaholic inside all of us, and definitely give their Spaghetti Calzone a shot! I wish I was in town longer to give SP's Pizza a shot, as I see it seems to be pretty popular. Next time, Gadget..."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is really yummy. I always get the Nicole's New Favorite. Great flavor and the pizza sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"My roommate and his family are from Chicago and are huge fans of Spinato's, that's how I was introduced. We used to always get the Hawaiian pizza until we discovered the spaghetti calzone. If you're a fan of carbs and the idea of a pasta-filled calzone sounds appealing, you'll love it! You have to ask for ricotta to be added (in addition to the standard mozzarella) and can add meatballs if you wish. It comes with extra sauce on the side. Very simple, but so delicious! I also like their cannoli, but they reduced the size to about half what they were and didn't reduce the price. I would order them all the time if they were big enough to warrant the higher than normal cost."}
{"text":"This location is not very close by, as I live in Tempe, but when it's a Monday and you're craving Spinato's one will make the longer drive! For some reason, I feel that once the pizza was a little underdone coming from the Chandler store, but none-the-less it's still delicious. So why are the other's closed on Monday's?   After camping for four days with only freeze-dried food to eat, my boyfriend and I were CRAVING some Italian goodness from Spinato's. We dreamed about it for days. Well it happened to be a Monday, and we still got what our little hearts desired, but our exhausted camper selves had to drive for it!   I can barely even eat Papa Johns style of \"fast food\" pizza anymore. I'm becoming a Spinato's snob. Sorry. Not that sorry!   My faves: Pizza- 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 Super Six, hot wings with ranch and a Greek Salad without olives"}
{"text":"I have eaten at four different Spinato's Pizza across the valley.  I am a big fan of their food and was excited for them when they opened on 7th Street because the building is prettier than their old 12th and Glendale location.    Yelp read my mind when it said, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"    I ordered the Mama's signature pizza via delivery.  It is not my first time getting a delivery order from them, so I was shocked when I felt the bottom of the box dripping with oil.  I'm not exaggerating when I say the box looked like it had been floating on a pile of water before arriving at my house.  I took a bite of the pizza and was even more disappointed.  The crust was crumbling because it was loaded with grease.  If I knew their quality would go down this badly after the change in location, I would have written to the owners everyday to convince them to stay where they were."}
{"text":"We (the husband, a toddler, a baby, and myself) decided to try out Spinato's Pizzeria for lunch on Black Friday after a quick search on yelp for pizza. I'm glad to say we had a pleasant experience and will definitely be coming back. We started off with an order of Chicken Wings while we tried to figure out what we wanted on our pizza. My husband suggested we order a few personal sized pizzas so we could enjoy a variety. We ended up trying a Get Meaty, a Salsicca Di Pollo, a Canadian, and of course a cheese pizza. Unfortunately, they were out of their Sicilian Crust; which is the only reason I gave them 4/5 stars. However, our waitress did let us know that thin crust was their specialty. Everything came out nice and hot and DELICIOUS! We actually ended up taking leftovers home which didn't make it through the night :)"}
{"text":"It was our 5th Anniversary and we were all set to go to Grimaldis in Peoria.  We got there and found out that there was an hour and a half wait.  Forget that!  I talked my wife into coming down here to Spinatos.  I had gotten a pizza from here a week or so ago and it was pretty delicious.  We drove down here and decided to eat here.  We walked in and were seated outside on the patio right away.  We went with a Greek Salad and a medium pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  Pepsi products to drink.  Here is how the food tasted...................  Greek Salad-  We got the \"entree\" sized salad and it was plenty for the two of us.  This thing was packed with lettuce, feta, tons of split olives, pepperocinis, onions etc.  We each had about 2 plate fulls worth.  Their dressing is delicious.  Creamy but not layered on heavy.  It was a great salad.  Pepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  My last pizza from here was for pickup.  It was a bit soggy when I got it.  When you eat in, it turned out to be much better.  Still a tiny bit greasy, but still delicious.  Our pizza was cooked proper with a little brown on the cheese.  Their sauce is fantastic and the pepperoni and garlic was a great combo.  Their sauce is a tad sweet but not too much so.  A medium pizza is perfect for two people.  Its a great Chicago thin crust.  I definitely want to try out some of their other offerings.   The reason I am giving this 5 stars though is because of the service!  The hostess was great, our waitress was on point and when we were leaving, everyone wished us a great evening and thanked us for our business.  Speaking of that..........while we were waiting for our check, an older gentleman came walking around asking tables how everything was.  It turns out that it was the OG himself...Ken Spinato!   The guy who started this place back in the 70s.  We chatted for awhile and got into a good conversation about our move from San Diego and how we were going to go to Grimaldis but came here instead.  He was impressed that we had driven from Surprise to come here.  We had a great conversation about pizza, their sauce, Phoenix in general etc.  It was a great way to end the night.  I'll be honest...Grimaldis is still my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area, but Spinatos is definitely creeping up the ladder.  Definitely the best Chicago style thin crust I have ever had, plus the service and overall friendliness of ALL the employees I have encountered will keep me and the family coming back!  I can definitely see why they are a Phoenix institution and why people love them so much.  It was a great 5th anniversary and I'm glad we spent it eating dinner here at Spinatos!"}
{"text":"A great pizza, I admit.  We have been regular customers for some time.  When out of towns guests come, especially from the Chicago area, we always take them to Spinato's which is really the old Aurelio's Pizza from Homewood, IL.  They are so busy, they don't need my business, but they lost me last night.  They were moderately busy when we asked for s table for 5.  \"There's another 5 in front of you.  A 45 minute wait.\"  That turned into an hour an 5 minute wait...waiting for the first five to show up...who didn't.  We left after all that time...insult to injury. Spinato's takes no reservations. And obviously doesn't need to.  I guess we were the fools and somebody like the manager is just as dense.  Somebody does not know much about customer relations, even for s small place. He could have added an extra chair at the end of a table, forgot about the first five, maybe offered a drink or an apology.  All that would have worked for us.  And, as for us...there is a pizza place everywhere...even Vito's right across the street."}
{"text":"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues."}
{"text":"One of my students moms raved about this place so we tried it. Now their pizza is my favorite! It's sweet and a delightful change from the corporate pizza out there."}
{"text":"I love Spinato's!  I have only gotten the Mama's Special, but it is always delicious.  We did a take out order, and the staff was friendly.  The pizza was ready when they said it would be."}
{"text":"I love Spinatos, and I'm  happy this location is near me. I always get the mama special, it's delicious. they have a nice little entrance for takeout orders at this location. I picked up my to go order and the service was excellent. Great quality pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent , my lady wouldn't let me add onions , which would of been even better ,next time I'm ordering w out her chicken sausage red sauce n Italian beef is a good combination."}
{"text":"During my mom's visit we decided to get pizza and chose Spinato's. We called and placed an order for a Sicilian pizza, half her toppings choice and half mine. We were quoted 50 minutes and were floored by the wait time, but figured if it was good that it'd be worth the wait. When we got there it was 55 minutes from the time of the call. We were told it'd be another 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes more and still no pizza, but then a nice guy went and got it from the back for my mom. We were starving when we got home and couldn't wait to try this great smelling pizza. The first thing I noticed was that it was round, traditional Sicilians are rectangular. The next thing I noticed was that the toppings were actually 1/3 and 2/3, leaving me with less pizza and my mom with more than she wanted. How does that even happen? As for taste, the pizza was only ok. The sauce was very sweet and for someone who likes most pizza sauces, this was off putting. Not sure if I'd go back given the flavor of the sauce, absurdly long wait and the higher than average cost. Our large Sicilian with 2 toppings was $22. I'll let you be the judge."}
{"text":"Spinatos is not your normal pizza - its heaven on a plate. You must get the Mama's Original Spinach... sooooo good. The sauce has a sweet flavor to it. Unlike any other pizza I've had. For sure filling.   The other thing my husband and I love about this place is that it's very obviously family run. The teenage kids work the front and act as servers - we love the vibe. I think its BYOB, too - bonus.   Unique pizza that's great to mix up the usual slice routine once in a while."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, have never had a bad experience.  Staff is friendly, and enthusiastic.  Always taken care of, we really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the east valley and are accustomed to getting some great pizza in downtown Phoenix at federal, pizza Bianco, chibo or the parlor. The move east has caused us to look a bit and outside of buddyz in queen creek we haven't found one that we love.  That may have changed tonight when we landed at spinatos. We had a delicious large thing crust.  Next trip we would ask for extra crispy but the crust was nice and light and the red sauce is amazing! The service in the bar by Janet was on point and the margarita was delicious! One cocktail, one soda and a side Cesar salad with a large 4 topping care in around 40.00 not bad! We will return!!!"}
{"text":"Spinato's is my GO TO place for pizza.  Their pizza, calzones...   well really just about anything on the menu is fabulous. Their homemade sauce is to die for and unique to itself.  I have dined in and the ambiance is great.  Taken out, when frankly, I just want to get home and relax, with my favorite comfort food.    I have tried most things on the menu and never had a bad taste experience.   I appreciate the fact, that even though they have multiple locations, they are locally owned so I am supporting MY local business' economy.   After enjoying Spinatos' for the past 14 years, this is the only pizza WORTHY of eating cold the next day."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! But I guess Spinato's finds it way too difficult to take the seeds and stems out of the pepperocinis. I always order mine that way with \"deseeded pepperocinis\".  Last time it came with long hard stems and seeds that were too hard to bite through. Now a true restaurateur would understand if their pepperocinis arrive that way to (1) Take a few minutes to get the seeds and stems out or (2) change vendors for the pepperocinis.   By the way, I've gotten many, many pizzas from Spinato's the correct way with clean pepperocinis.  First time I complained they tried doing the right thing. They gave us a free pizza -- but the pizza arrived with stems and hard seeds on the pepperocinis!!  In order for me to try to get the hard pieces out, I have to spit out the pepperocini. We didn't call again because we wanted it simply done correctly, not another free pizza.   So needless to say, we waited till we ordered again. I explained the situation to the employee and she asked me to wait while she gets the manager. So Emily gets on the phone and in a perfunctory manner tells my husband they can't control their supplier. He asked that they at least remove the stems. Emily responded \"Sir, that's the best we can do.\"  My husband continued to explain how there should be nothing that we get from a restaurant that we would have to spit out.  She kept responding the same way over and over. \"I can't promise you anything, sir, we're doing the best we can.\" Then she told him if he was still unhappy to go write it on their website. It's so ridiculously frustrating!  The definition of good service  -- \"To be well served, you first serve others well.\""}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service!  I was with my husband and we had finished eating.  We were talking about my rough week as a close friend had been involved in an accident and was fighting for his life.  I teared up and immediately Alexandria was at our table asking if I was OK or if I needed anything.  So many people would have just ignored my emotions.  Thank you to her for checking on me!  We will be back for both the food and the service!!"}
{"text":"We were those awful people that show up right before closing. We were celebrating for a bachelorette party. Our waitress was really amazing and gave us honest recommendations.  The mixed drinks were really good. Pizza was amazing. The strawberry salad was delicious! I would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and are never disappointed. The pizza and calzone are superb. I always leave over full as I can't get enough. Wait staff are friendly. My only recommendation is to improve the wine list."}
{"text":"Sone of the best pizza in Arizona.  I'm from NY so I can't say best ever. .. Haha,  but very good and won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in first experience, ordered Pizza to go, was vastly overcooked, dry, disappointing. I've had better frozen Pizza, won't give them,a second chance after all."}
{"text":"This pizza was ordered at my job. Their pizzas are on point. The fennel thin crust pizza was the best pizza I ever have eaten."}
{"text":"Get a calzone stuffed with spaghetti & meatballs & your life will forever be changed. Oh, and the pizza is awesome here too. It's quickly becoming my favorite date night location with my wife."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Wonderful service - tastes like true Chicago explosion in your mouth! We will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"To keep it simple...  I live in LA and am in the process of coming up with a master plan to have their pizza delivered to me on a weekly basis. I'm talkin that dayum good!  GO. RUN. NOW."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed growing up here I have many great memories of eating at this location and it's always been the best pizza out there in my opinion . But things have changed, Now with that being said I think part of the problem is that the ovens they use for take out are completely separate than the ones in dine  in ,which I can tell the difference in the pizza in the dine in area is alway amazing !!!! Take out from here is just so so. I really think the Glendale location is best now they are always 100% consistent in flavor of their special sweet sauce oh that is the best part after all of this place :) I have not tried their dessert in all the years I have been one here but they look really good . If you are looking for something tasty and different than a normal pizza this is the place to try."}
{"text":"This will be a review only of their online take-out experience. The pizza itself was fabulous, but I've reviewed it at another location. This was my first time trying their online ordering system and their new location.   Perfect. I ordered from the comfort of my home, and promptly (within 1 minute) received confirmation of my order, which said 45 minutes. I showed up after 35 because I like to get my pizza hot, and sometimes those wait times are sandbagged.   The place was hopping, and I don't just mean the restaurant. Even their take-out side was packed. I was still greeted warmly when I entered, and waited upon promptly. It wasn't ready yet, but she went back tithe kitchen and told me it would be no longer than 9 minutes. Pretty specific, but it was absolutely correct. The nice girl helping me even opened the pizza box to double check everything was in order. They did this for everyone. I appreciate that, because I hate getting home to find a mistaken pizza. So do they.   The place was immaculate. They just opened a month ago, sure, but the place was looking pristine. The goodies in their bakery display looked pretty delicious as well.   I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing. Amazing is not even good enough to explain it. Just try it. The wings are hot, but the flavor is worth it. If you are on a diet do not even bother, because one slice us not good enough. However, the salads are awesome too."}
{"text":"New restaurant, good pizza, nice atmosphere! I like their patio! You can order individual pizza what is really convenient! Huge Variety in menu!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM, the greatest pizza in phoenix Forsure! I stick with the classic pepperoni and cheese, but the ingredients are fresh and the sauce is out of this world! I can't find anything like it. I've never eaten on location, always had delivery. You know this place is good when there usually is a 45-1:30 minute wait.  Now that I've finally read other reviews on this place...it looks like I'm going to have to be stopping in!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is still fantastic however the service continues to go down hill every visit in the last few months. Most recently ordered $150 worth of pizza for my employees, asked for a side of ranch from the manager who stated it would be 50¢ extra. Even after ordering that much food an extra ranch apparently is going to put them out of business if it's given away. The managers response was \"its a business, I'm sure you understand\". I hope that manager understands how business really works because he will now loose an additional $150 of orders a month. Last time I'll be treating my employees to this restaurant unfortunately."}
{"text":"This used to be me and my boyfriends favorite place for pizza hands down. The last so many times we have eaten there or had it delivered the pizza doigh has been under cooked and multiple times recieved the wrong toppings. The quality has really come down. I really hate leaving these kind of reviews but I hope it helps Spinatos with their quality control."}
{"text":"Here is a great example of a good restaurant formula! Short and sweet menu, well-trained staff, good prices.  Do l need to say more or why don't you try it for yourself and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Spinato's is my absolute favorite pizza place!! All of their locations are great, however, this one and some of the others are even better because they have wings! I always get their spaghetti calzone with vodka sauce and their sweet chili or honey bbq wings! Their pizza is really good too! I also love that you can get a \"personal\" size pizza or calzone, because I don't eat a ton and even still that is enough for left overs usually."}
{"text":"I've had Spinato's pizza numerous times and each time it is great. This time was not any different. The trio of meatballs was delicious and great amount of ooey melty cheese. Their pizzas are always great!  The reason for my rating only being 3 stars during this particular visit is for the service. We got to the restaurant around 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday and the place had only a handful of people, but we still waiting about 15 minutes. Maybe they were getting ready for the dinner rush, so it wasn't that big of a deal. Once we finally got seated our waiter greeted us and took drink orders right away. After bringing our drinks we put in our order for appetizers and salads while we still made decisions on the types of pizzas we wanted. As we sat there waiting for our appetizers, the restaurant slowly started filling up. The waiter would constantly walk past us to greet and take orders from his other tables, so it was difficult to get his attention to place our pizza orders. When we finally got our appetizers and salads, the waiter was nowhere really to be found. We started eating the salads and appetizers, but slowly since we hadn't even had a chance to place our pizza orders and we knew that would take awhile. The waiter finally came by to take the pizza orders about 10-15 minutes after we had gotten our appetizers and salads. I've never been to a restaurant that took quite this long to place main entree orders.  We ordered two kids pizzas, two medium pizzas, and two small pizzas for our group of 6. We knew the food would take some time since it was quite a bit of food and the restaurant was filling up for the dinner rush. About 20 minutes later all the pizzas came out. They had messed up on the kids pizzas, so they brought out extras which was very nice of them. Again, we didn't see our waiter  for a little bit after our pizzas had arrived, so we had to ask another staff member for plates. Like I said in the beginning, the food was great!  We saved some room for dessert, so once the waiter came back we ordered some gelato and a cannoli. The first set of desserts (one cannoli, one chocolate gelato, and one pistachio gelato) came out, without any utensils and one of the gelatos was in a weird clear bowl. I didn't think too much of it since the chocolate gelato came with the kids menu, so I thought that's why it came in the nice white dish. However, once the second set of desserts came out (one chocolate gelato, one pistachio gelato, one raspberry gelato) all in the same nice white dish I found it even more odd that the other pistachio was in a clear dish. The dish was clean, so we let it slide. When the second set of desserts came out, they all came with spoons and ready to go so the other half of our party was able to eat them right away. As for the other half (first set of desserts), we had to look around and wait for our waiter or another staff member for spoons. We finally got the attention of another staff member who brought us out spoons. As soon as she brought those spoons out our waiter showed up.   To recap: The food was great. I liked everything that we had to eat. It was really the service, inconsistencies, and wait time that was lacking.   I've waitressed before so I know first hand that when it gets busy it is difficult to give every table 100% of your time and attention. I don't expect that of any wait staff, but I would appreciate a check in every once in awhile. Especially, when we hadn't placed food orders yet and you're really focusing only on one or two of your tables. I watched a couple of other tables become a little irritated in waiting for the same waiter."}
{"text":"Have eaten here for years and have always had excellent pizza but this most recent time the crust was soft and the sauce was overly sweet. Hope this was just an off day"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhh, it was just ok.  The pizza sauce is not to my liking, it's too sweet for me.  They have a limited number of deep dish crust's so we ordered a large because that was all they had left, the pizza was big and served hot, I ordered half with pepperoni and it was a little skimpy on the topping but overall the pizza was good if you like sweeter sauce.    I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the stuffing was good but they were way way to salty, I like salt but this was over the top, I only ate a couple.   I also had a Chicken Caesar and it was really good.  I'd order that again. Overall three stars for me, service at the bar was slow, friendly but slow to refill drinks, bring us our check, and the server didn't really check in on us at all during the meal."}
{"text":"If you have a chance you definately need to try this place!! Ravioli with vodka sauce is the best!! Service is great they are always extremely friendly and food comes out fast!! Don't pass this place by."}
{"text":"Wow...strongly rivals Crust as the best pizza in Phx/Scottsdale.  Sauce is a bit sweet, but crust and cheese make it an incredible combination.   Extra crispy is the way to go.  This is a must have!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from Spinato's.  we  were specific about the toppings.  When we went to pick it up, the pizza was wrong.  Spinato's said they would remake the pizza ( a good 30 minute wait) or take as is.  We took it as is, but were disappointed in such a response.  We should have been offered a discount.    The pizza itself was fine, but not outstanding.  It was not greasy, and was rather tasty.   However, I would think twice about Spinato's given they way they handled their error."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the valley.  My parents always want to go to Spinato's every time they come to visit. The Mama's signature is amazing. Best gluten free pizza I've had for sure! Sometimes there can be a long wait for delivery or even pick up so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Service is Horrible luckily there lack of service does not have anything to do with the food the food was great I sat for an hour to get my dish when the couples on my left and right got their appetizers and entrees"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here Sunday and I must say that I wasn't wowed. Hubby ordered the pasta with seafood- which he loved. I ordered the meat pizza Sicilian style and I just didn't like it at all.  The sauce is way too sweet and too much of it on pizza. There was so much oregano on top that it over powered the flavors of the meats and cheese. I wasn't impressed with the pizza crust.  It tasted like cardboard.  I gave 4 stars because of the pasta ,ambience & good service"}
{"text":"Long time customer here.   About a month ago, I ordered a small, thick crust pizza. Went to go pick it up and they informed me that they ran out of thick crust and someone should have called me. Unfortunately no one did so I took the thin crust one home, a little grumpy. Instead of running onto yelp or social media, I gave them a chance to fix it! I feel no one does this anymore and just runs and complains. I emailed them personally, explained the situation just to bring it to their attention. Wasn't expecting anything more.   The sweetest manager reached out to me personally, apologized deeply and credited my account for another pie on the house.   So tonight, I went and picked up my thick crust pizza on the house and it was amazing as always.   I appreciate the company reaching out and fixing a small issue to a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  The service was decent.  We sat outside and encountered some weirdos who looked like they just got done with taping an episode of Jerry Springer.  Sort of killed the \"romantic\" ambience we had going with the candlelit dinner but that's not the restaurant's fault.  As for the pizza, the sauce is a bit sweeter like everyone says.  It's not bad, but not really super good either."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the employees here are great and do a great job. Now, the food just isn't very exciting. I came with a group and some of the group got kid pizzas... these things were so tiny, they could fit on an appetizer sized plate. The kids were still hungry. Also, the sauce is sweet, I know that's their thing at Spinato's, but I have to be in a certain mood to want this. I got a calzone here and was surprised when it came out with no ricotta cheese... apparently you have to request it special because when I got the bill it specifically said 'no ricotta'.... I thought ricotta was standard in a calzone... it was really disappointing. The prices here are fair and the food is ok, but it isn't anything special."}
{"text":"This location is certainly a step above their old location on Glendale. I went here with a large party (about 10 people) and they were very accommodating. They had a table ready for us on a Thurs night in about 10 minutes. In the meantime, the husband and I checked out their (very large) bar. He had a snakebite, which was prepared incorrectly (the cider and porter were mixed together instead of layered, but at least it was reasonably priced at 5$), I had the Shandy, which was unusually made with porter and lemonade (most shandys I have tried are with a lighter beer). I really enjoyed my drink! I felt like the lemonade lightened the otherwise heavy porter. Anyway, the service was good for our large party and the food didn't take too long to come out. We had several pizzas, a spaghetti and meatballs, a couple small calzones, wings, cheesy bread, and a couple salads. The sweet chili wings were maybe the best item... just enough heat and falling off the bone... really good wings. The cheese bread was good, but come on, it's melted cheese on bread (can't really be bad). The meatballs were good, but could have had a bit more sauce. The caesar salad was a little too fishy tasting, but their italian dressing was good. I had the 'mama's special' personal calzone add basil and ricotta. This thing was very tasty with garlic, tomato, and spinach.... and at just over 5$, it was a great price for the amount of food you get (fairly large). I would come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Very good ... We had a thin crust with Roma tomatoes and fresh basil!  Service a lil'l slow but they were very busy!"}
{"text":"Great food, the service at this location is really bad :(  I recommend the NE Phoenix location or delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza here is one of the best in town. They use the best ingredients. The pizza sauce is sweet and it takes you right back to Chicago!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in AZ. Have been coming here for years and thought it was time to finally do a yelp review. This place is the best!  Special shout out to Sara who always takes such great care of us at the bar.  Best pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"Once again, you rocked it! Best pizza ever! Fresh ingredients, excellent sauces. Yum!"}
{"text":"After my initial review I was contacted by Morgan of Spinato's. Despite my feelings towards this place Morgan was kind enough to invite my family and I back to show us how it is supposed to be done. My last experience, I will just hash up to a bad day at the restaurant. Everyone has them, people and businesses, and second chances are in order. I am glad I did.   The food is great, it was the first time and it was exciting to come back to the second time. We love this pizza. My kids love it because they get their own pizza, drink and desert for about $6. Great deal. The quality of these pies are insane. Great crust, the sauce is delicious, toppings are fresh and flavorful. Very happy with the food. Service was outstanding this time. Our waitress was kind and thoughtful and even engaged our 5 year old and asked her what she wanted, great job!   Thank you for having us back Morgan and righting our wrong ideas about Spinato's. Can't wait to come again and again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Spinato's!  I highly recommend the Baked Spaghetti Calzone -- It's fantastic! They have the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted. Their staff is always upbeat & positive. And they deliver -- Woo Hoo!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza! It's absolutely worth the price and wait- just a couple side notes.. I did get really sick from their ranch dressing and the other is that we ordered take out and unfortunately they made our pizza wrong when we arrived and had to remake it which did make us wait another 45 minutes. Other than that it's amazing and I would really recommend."}
{"text":"So this place has great garlic Parmesan bread and  great pizza! My issue with this place is when one of the servers brought out our wings, we asked Her which were mild and which were hot? She said she didn't know and was looking at them Trying to figure it out, then it happened (appeared to be in slow motion) she smelt our wings to try and tell the two apart! As If we weren't already appalled enough, her hair grazed the wings! I wanted to puke! I'm sure her hair is clean, but idc, that was absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"This Spinato's is EXCELLENT. The restaurant itself is so nice, and the food is terrific. Amazing pizza and sauce. Full bar too. Bobby was fantastic as our bartender, kudos to him! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love me some Spinato's pizza. The sauce is unique, with a very sweet twinge to it. It's not for everybody, but it works for me. Good toppings & crust too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've tasted amazing pizza from here before, but I was a little disappointed with their service tonight. I tried to order online for a pickup and it said they were closed. So I had to call them and order over the phone and ordered the Gorgonzola salad with strawberries and a side of chicken and a brownie. There was a bit of a line with the pickup, but I was able to get my order without a problem. Just a bit disappointed that I paid for the chicken with my salad and didn't get any. The salad and the brownie were both amazing. As soon as they get the kinks worked out with their online ordering and work on those those small details, I have no doubt, I will be able to give a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"The reason this restaurant gets 4 stars is for the gluten free selection. Being from NJ, it's easier now to find gluten free pizza, but here I can also get gluten free garlic bread and caesar salad which is a huge plus! I agree with another reviewer that it has the pizza hut vibe, but when you have a gluten allergy, sometimes the greasy manufactured pizza taste is urned for. The service was excellent during rush hour and I would go back!"}
{"text":"First time - one of my sisters suggested our family meet here for lunch as it accomadte our group of 9 and it is kid friendly.  We got there right at 12pm today - on a Sunday so there was no wait, the place was clean, and had a good vibe.  I ordered a Bloddy Mary - good presentation, but there seemed to be no alcohol in it, and it tasted like tomato juice.  I let the server know, and asked her to correct it.  She let me know that there may be a change to add alcohol. I told her if they feel that is fair, than I am ok with that - their call.  She came back with the same drink, unchanged, explaining that the lack of vodka taste was siracha vodka.  I just sent it back -  it was a special occasion so I thought I would treat myself, now it's not worth it.  Moving on -   The server was nice, but slow. I had to ask her name / no name tag, or introduction.  I had to ask for refills (empty for OVER 10 mins), wrong size calzone was brought out (they did make that right) and they never brought the chicken wings, so we reminded them and canceled.. The food was OK, but I doubt I will return. There are many other places around here with better customer service that I will go to."}
{"text":"I am self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur and no one can tell me otherwise, so do yourself a favor and try out Spinato's Pizzeria! I was visiting my sister from out of town and she had recommended Spinato's for our last meal out in town. I trust her opinion on the matter since we both inherited our father's appetite for pizza.   We came in on Sunday afternoon and happy hour was available; Can't go wrong with weekend happy hour! We ordered wings in mild and hot sauce and the meatball trio as appetizers. Wings came out perfectly crispy and hot. The mild sauce had a perfect kick, but the hot sauce was a tad too much heat for me, but DUH! it's in the name. We were off to a great start... We debated about getting a medium or large pizza (3 of us), but decided on large so that we would have leftovers for later that night. Our pie came out fast and hot! First bite into the cheesy goodness and i was hooked! The sauce is different than anything I have ever tasted, it was tangy and sweet and perfectly balanced. Remember the \"leftovers\" i briefly mentioned. Well forget I ever mentioned it because there was none at the end of our meal.  A+ for the food!   To top it off the service was awesome! The manager on duty on Sunday 5/27 was on point with making us feel welcomed and ensuring we had a great experience. I wish I caught his name, but I think it was Kelvin or Kevin. It was my first time at Spinato's, but it definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. This was my favorite place to get Chicago pizza, just like back home. I have visited every location Spinato's has to offer. I was never disappointed until this evening. I ordered a Large \"Chicago\" pizza and an order of meatballs for pickup. I was told 30 minutes. I left my home 30 minutes later thinking it will give them an extra 10-15 minutes since I live that far away. I arrived and was greeted kindly, but nothing was ready. I was told it would be another 10 minutes until the food was ready. Meanwhile a young lady walked in and was told the same. We both waited while pizza after pizza kept coming out and put in the warmer. The kid, sorry gentleman behind the counter never once seemed to turn around to see that. I knew my order was one of them. A girl came out to ask me if I wanted to wait for my bread, which surprised me because all I ordered was pizza and meatballs and none of which came with any bread. I told her that I didn't want bread. The order for the young lady then came out and guess what?? They didn't give her the bread that they asked me about. They didn't know who's order was who's? She seemed disappointed when the gentleman behind the counter told her that they asked me if I wanted the bread. Confusing, right? A girl came from the back asking what number my order was, to which I replied, \"268\". She then opened the warmer to pull out my order, which was sitting there another 10 minutes. I came home and the pizza was just completely soggy, not even edible. The meatballs were the size of golf balls with enough sauce to only cover one of them. Ridiculous. This place used to be awesome, now it's just your basic run of the mill pizza joint. I can not believe how far they have fallen. The customer service at pickup is just teenage kids who cannot concentrate enough to figure out the orders. I won't waste my time with this place. I'll stick to other places in the area. Get your act together!"}
{"text":"In town from Charlotte and we were lucky to find this place. It was so so delicious!  We got the Big 6 (or something like that) and it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place, and even more so, this exact location.  There are so many things I enjoy about this place, I am a little torn on where to start.  Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order, and then give details about what I love about this place:  Drink (Any Arizona Stronghold wine, I really like their reds - Dala specificly)  App (Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either, and then I tasted it WOW!)  Pizza (thin crust Spicy Italian (w/ Jalepanos) or (The Combo).  Dessert - (Pistachio Gelato)  Ok, start from the outside, work my way inside, and work from apps and drinks through dessert.  Outside:  GORGEOUS, one story brick building on Chandler Blvd between 48th and 50th Street (just west of the I-10 exit).  The parking lot is very crowded during the busier times (evenings, especially Friday and Saturday).    Inside: Once you are inside the building, there isn't a large waiting area, and once you get your seats, you will see why.  They maximum the space in the building for those sitting and enjoying their food/drinks.  Even in the areas where there are more tables (eastside of the building), it never feels too crowded to me.  The westside of the building is the bar, and smaller tables with really nice, fabric-covered seats (fancy). :)  Staff:  The hostesses, to the waitstaff, to the managers (who my wife and I met while dinning on a less busy Saturday afternoon) are fantastic at customer service.  I can't think of a single time we have been that we haven't really enjoyed ourselves, and part of that can be attributed to the wonderful people who wait on us.  Drinks:  Very good wine selection (whites and reds) and they do a respectable job making sure to work in good, quality local winieries (Arizona Stronghold and Pilsbury come to mind).  My only (slight) complaint, is I would like to see a wider craft beer selection (especially as many local brewers as possible, Four Peaks, Sun Up, to name a few).  Food: OMG! This food is always fantastic.  My wife and I always get the meatball trio in vodka sauce.  These are the most moist and flavorful meatballs I have eaten, and that doesn't even include the vodka sauce and cheese in which the meatballs are cooked.    Pizzas - Haven't had a bad one yet; the only one's I am not as in love with are any of the one's that come with spinich (I think because I don't love cooked spinich, not because they aren't doing something right).  Sandwiches - Haven't had one, so no opinion (although the ones to pass my table smelled great! :) ).  Pasta - My wife had the special, which was a seafood and pasta dish  which had scallops (cooked perfectly), baby clams, and shrimp (so tender) in a wonderful tomato sauce.  I don't like clams, but this all blended so nicely where no parts of the seafood or pasta, or sauce over-powered one another.  Dessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli (and this place does), I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it.  Until our last trip, when the waiter (playfully) made us order the gelato (Pistachio).  We are so glad he did!  We loved it!  With a large selection of food options, there is something for everone!"}
{"text":"Arrived as they just opened, super quick service of course. Nobody there! They server was super friendly and nice, she got my order in right away. Booths are a little un comfy to sit in, but at least they have booths! Ordered an iced tea and it is brewed perfectly, and served with a lemon. Music is a little loud... Maybe they forgot to turn it down cause they just opened up. But I like loud music so I'm not complaining, I think others might. They have a nice little bar seating about 10. Looks like they have a decent selection of wine, beer and Pepsi products.  They have 2 crappy flat screen tv's that you can't hear. This is probably my 3rd time here, and I have yet to try something other then the this crust pizza because it's so delicious I don't want to order something I may not like... But next time I will broaden my horizons and test something else out.   I got my pizza in about 10 minutes. Greasy and delicious! I love how they serve the pizza on a rack that sits on the pizza pan, that way it doesn't just soak all of its grease up and get soggy.   I highly recommend this place to pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!! What a waste of money! I cannot for the life of me comprehend why or how anyone can give this pizza a high rating. It's disgusting! It tasted like one of those $1 frozen pizzas you heat up in a microwave. Terrible textured crust, the sauce is lacking true flavor (more like jarred grocery store sauce) and the toppings taste old & rubbery. It was just so sloppy & generic. I also made the mistake of ordering the bruschetta. The bread was all wrong for it first of all and the topping for it wasn't nearly enough for each slice. The first time I've ever been so disappointed in that appetizer anywhere. People of Phoenix....have any of you ever actually had a good slice of REAL PIZZA PIE?? Because these raving reviews leave me feeling so so sorry for your lack of taste."}
{"text":"Very good.  We stumbled upon happy hour which features $5 wines by the glass and food specials.  The $4 wings was a huge hit and very good.  We also ordered several pizzas to share.  The sauce is sweet and delicious.  All around, a great place."}
{"text":"Another great location.  We had not been to this one before, but love other locations so wanted to give it a try.  They never disappoint.  Great pizza, wings and even house wine.  Head over for happy hour to get drinks, apps, salad and pizza at great prices.  The Get Meaty is my favorite specialty pizza on happy hour and it was awesome as always.  Also the sweet chili boneless wings are pretty great.  Never had wine at one of these before, but decided to try a $4 happy hour house cab sauv.  Excellent for being the house special!  About this location.  Really unique and modern.  They have a nice bar and out door setup that's very open and inviting.  And, when they got busy for dinner rush, they had an extra room inside that looks almost like a wins cellar.  Cool setup.  Also, the staff was real friendly and helpful.  This location will be on our list for Phoenix spots going forward!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place in Phoenix!  The sauce is so flavorful, and the crust is always perfect.  This is just an amazing, family-owned restaurant that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Our son just moved to PHX and lives just up the road. A friend of his recommended we give this place a try.  Holy cow, this place was good! We ordered a large pizza for 3 of us and split the toppings between 2 different ingredient combos. I was the one eating only the toppings because I'm low carbing. We barely finished this pie! Also had the antipasto, which was so fresh and delicious. Awesome dressing.   Guessing our son will be a regular. Not sure if that's a blessing or a curse!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is really lovely.  It feels modern, yet old-school Italian at the same time.  The pear and gorgonzola salad I got was really nice, I think it would've been perfect with the addition of some beets!  The only reason I give this place 3 stars and not 2 is because I liked the salad.  On the downside, the pizza wasn't great.  And for a place that is a pizzeria, that's pretty important.  The crust was thinner than I expected and didn't have a particularly nice texture.  It kind of felt like the crust on frozen pizzas.  Also the sauce was WAYYY too sweet.  Don't trust the reviewer who said the sauce is \"slightly\" sweet, it's SUPER sweet.  So much so that I wanted to eat more of my pizza, but also felt sick at the thought of trying to eat any more."}
{"text":"Sicilian pizza not good. Doesn't resemble the pictures posted. Ours is covered in a really sweet pizza sauce on top of cheese and under it. Toppings scarce. Maybe an off day there but the expectations were higher. 4 people and 4 pieces eaten with the rest headed for the trash."}
{"text":"The pizza here is the best. We love going to this place. The service is good and the food is even better."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings in the valley. No doubt about it. Try the mango, habanero sauce on the side."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Spinato's for Cinco de Mayo after a negative experience with another restaurant. We were seated immediately.  The server made sure we knew about their specials and offered recommendations.  Our drink and food orders were taken quickly.  The food tasted great.  The server was friendly and efficient.  Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Me and my brother and his family took my father and MOM here for Father's Day this is my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area and this location at 16th st and bell rd never disappoints I have eaten at other spinatos and they are all great but this one is heads and tails above the rest!! If you're looking for unique totally fantastic tasting pizza I highly recommend spinatos this is my favorite location we did have to wait a little bit because it was Father's Day and this is a smaller establishment but the wait is well worth it the pizza is absolutely unbelievable when we ordered it I always like to order well done and our server didn't just ask if we wanted well done she asked if we preferred the top to be crispier burned or the bottom or both never had anybody at a pizza place ask me that. We elected to go with well-done on top and bottom and let me tell you they did not disappoint pizza was absolutely perfect!!  unfortunately I live in Goodyear and I had to drive 45 minutes to get there let me tell you it's worth it if you read this review and you want a great pizza check this place out they will not disappoint you! Thank you spinatos team! I only wish Spinatos had a restaurant in Goodyear!! Maybe someday!"}
{"text":"This review goes out to all of the Yelpers out there who bash a restaurant after one bad visit AND to all the restaurants who don't try to make up for their mistakes--you know who you are.  As a preface, my great and friendly waiter confessed to me that in all his years as professional server, he has never had an order that got as messed up as mine, but I still am givng four stars.  How can this be, you ask?   1.  The food I did get was really good.   2.  The Server and the Manager both personally came over and sincerely apologized to me.  They also tried their best to try to improve my total experience by offering an extra serving of what I really did order (to go) and an extra glass of wine (both of which I did not accept). 3.  The restaurant comp'ed my entire meal 4.  My server even said he didn't expect any tip.  (I actually tipped him well)    I was in the Phoenix area for business, so I was dining alone.  Now, I hate eating out alone.  Luckily, I sat at one of the tables in the bar so I was entertained by the D-back's baseball game on all TVs.  I ordered a small Mamma's Signature Spinach Calzone with sausage added and a glass of wine.  I had been nursing my wine for quite a while (about 35-40 minutes) when my server approached and told me that he was really sorry about the long wait.  Something had gone wrong causing my order to be really delayed, but he said that the kitchen was finishing my calzone now.  Finally, he added that they'd be comp-ing my wine because of the delay. I said, OK and sure enough, a few moments later, a calzone appeared.  I was starving by then and dug right in.  One bite into it, I realized that there was no spinach in this calzone--only sausage.  Although a little disappointed that I didn't get the \"signature\" item, the calzone was really good.  Yes, the sauce is a little sweet, but it's not as dramatic as some other yelpers make it out to be.  The outer crust on the calzone is firm, but maintains some softer \"give\" on the inside.    When the server came around to check on me, I mentioned that there was no spinach in the calzone and he turned a little white.  I'm pretty sure that when he had re-entered my order he had forgotten that I had ordered the Singature spinach with Sausage.  Anyway, he immediately asked if I wanted it remade.  I declined since I was so hungry.    In the end, I was very happy with the efforts made to make up for the various mistakes.  I think the fact that I did not flip out made them work all the harder to make amends.  I would go back in a heartbeat if only to try that Mamma's Signature Spinach!"}
{"text":"I first tried Spinato's in 1997 when it was a hole in the wall in an industrial complex buried in Tempe. It really wasn't a restaurant at all. More like a secret pizza establishment that only the lucky few knew of...yet the line was always out the door around lunch time. Now year's later, I work right down the street from the Ahwatukee location and STILL remain a loyal, faithful customer who is convinced that you just can't order anything like it anywhere else. My first experience was the famous spinach pizza. I can honestly tell you, I had never eaten spinach before and had I not tried that slice, I may never have! Today I like to try different pizzas as well as their other dishes too. Tonight I ordered the Nicole's favorite but I get it with ricotta instead of feta cheese. Oh mah gah! So amazing! Calzones are huge and so soft and fresh. Salads are perfect. I can't think of anything this place can't make right! If you are looking for something south of Bianco and with a twist, check it out. It's even worth a drive I'd say.There's a reason their spinach pizza is \"famous\". Oh. Don't skip the chocolate chip cookies on your way out. Trust me on this."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The best sauce, if you like sweet or flavorful sauce this is your sauce. The servers were extremely kind and helpful, when I needed an adjustment to something, they took it like it was nothing! Also, my son accidentally spilled his drink and they were so nice about it. They just said no problem, and cleaned it right up. I would come here forever, they are the best!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go to. The best pizza we have found! Their sauce is different than most and is sweet and basily and soooo good. Their salads are really fresh and delicious and their pastas are very good. The service is really good and we love the casual atmosphere. We love Spinato's and it is a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Stopped here after signing up for a Birthday Coupon and we were pleasantly surprised. We sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon and Hannah, our server couldn't have been sweeter. We got a Hawaiian pizza with Canadian bacon, about $11.00, of which we would get $10 off with the above mentioned coupon. It was fantastic!  The sauce was so good. And I'm Swedish. What do I know from sauce? I had a Prosecco and my husband had a house red and the drinks were perfect. They have a wonderful happy hour, seven days a week!!  (7 days a week?  The holy grail for HH as far as I'm concerned ). We'll be back to try the stuffed mushrooms or meatballs for $4 and $5.  There are several locations but we tried the Bell and 16th spot.  And, icing on the cake, a free cannoli for my birthday!   It's tucked behind \"Codfather's\" (what?!?!). Give it a try."}
{"text":"Really cool place, nice vibe, wings were really really good but the pizza was different then what I expected. Sauce was sweet, the pizza was solid, but bit into it and was shocked the sauce was sweet. Depending on what you like, could go either way. I was t a huge fan of the sauce but I give them credit it was different.   I really liked everything else, plus they had peroni beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Have been a big fan of Spinato's since I was first introduced a few years back. I have been to the North Phx, Tempe, and Scottsdale locations and they're all very pleasant.  I would highly recommend their spaghetti calzone to a first-time diner.  I like it with or without the meatballs and ricotta cheese options.  You may be able to split the \"small\" size between two people.    Decent pricing for a date for two:   - They have nightly drink specials (1/2 off bottles of wine, ladie's night, guy's night, etc.) - Split the Small House salad & fresh bread to start (or indulge in the mozzarella cheesy garlic bread) - Get the Spaghetti Calzone (my favorite item on the menu) - Maybe add on a personal size pizza too - the flavor is great!  I go with the thin crust and about any combination of toppings will do the trick.  Also - take home any leftovers - they re-heat great for a couple days!"}
{"text":"PROS:   - Spaghetti and meatballs calzone!!! - Pizza is bomb - Their marinara sauce is on point! - Good portions - Decent prices  CONS:   - None"}
{"text":"This is a new location for them and, from the earlier reviews here, they had a few things to work out. Well, they have.   We stopped by at 6 and expected to have to wait, judging by the cars in the lot, but there were plenty of tables for 2-4 - hey, it can't be easy to put together seating for 14 but they did it that evening - twice while we were there. But I can't see there will be a problem for a couple or two.   Service was top notch. We wanted two plates. A pasta to share, Chicken Marsala, and a pizza as second plate. No problem! The pasta was out in a flash and truly delicious. As we finished the first plate our pizza arrived. Hot, perfectly baked, and wonderful.   I am rarely delighted by a restaurant but this night turned out perfectly. This is our new go-to pizza/pasta place and I can't wait to try their take out. You can get a pizza ready for the oven, or 3/4 baked for warming at home, or fully baked.   Go here. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I enjoy their pizza. I also like my crust extra crispy, so I ask them to run the crust through the oven twice. Perfection! Always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese ravioli to be delivered to work. It arrived fast, but as I ate I could not chew some parts. When I spit them out, I discovered shredded plastic- I'm thinking it was a bag of some sorts. Replacing it was not an option and I doubt I want to call again to use my \"credit\". Not sure how much I ate..."}
{"text":"Their dining room is really small. We were at a booth but the table in the middle was only about a foot and half away from us. It was loud.   The pizza was good. When we go back we will definitely sit outside or get it to go.   The bar only seemed to have wine and beer. No cocktails. :("}
{"text":"I have been eating Spinato's for years!  I ate at their new location on 7th St before the light parade last week.  The restaurant is fab, especially the bar. We sat outside and warmed ourselves by the fire. This place has the best sauce in town!"}
{"text":"I think the pizza here is pretty good. It's a nice value given how large a pizza is. The thin crust pizza is probably my favorite. Veggie pizza has a really nice assortment of different toppings. Cheese is always a good classic, and sausage is hearty and delish.  The Sicilian pizza is pretty good. The sauce is a bit sweet, but it's huge, and again, a good value for what you get. I think in the future I'll stick with the thin crust. Salads are large and very filling. You could easily split one with someone in addition to a small pizza and have a nice, filling meal.  If you're in the mood for pizza, especially if you have a group of kids, Spinato's is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The best part of this place is the sweet tomato sauce, and doing take-out/delivery instead of eating in. When you do take-out/delivery there is this corn meal stuff on the bottom of the pizza that I absolutely love. What do you order? Like I said, you need something where you get the sweet tomato sauce. I have learned to get the $10 small pizza during happy hour so I can customize my own with homemade Italian sausage and pepperoni. So delicious! I don't need all these overly creative specialty pizzas. Do not order the Roasted Fennel & Italian Sausage. It is god-awful."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had IN ARIZONA. PERIOD. HANDS DOWN.  As a girl born & raised in the Midwest, I'm accustomed to good pizza....good Chicago-style pizza that is: Hearty sauce and thick crust. So imagine my dismay upon relocating to AZ & being inundated with piddly thin crust pizza everywhere (like having pizza toppings on a Saltine cracker IMO) with weak sauce.  Luckily that's not the case with Spinatos! The Sicilian style pizza is exquisite. The crust is thick, the sauce is robust & sweet, and the cheese is pure perfection. They add spices on top and it really enhances the flavor!  Anytime I venture out & try a different pizza place I wind up disappointed & compare it (unfavorably) to Spinatos. Well, I'm DONE trying new/different pizza joints. Screw variety, Spinatos is the spice of life!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?  I ordered on line, once I hit submit I found out it was going to be over 100 minutes until the order was delivered. SERIOUSLY?!? I called and changed it to pick up. The personal pan pizza was microscopic. It was four tiny slices, maybe three bites each. The pizza was drowned in sauce! I ordered the meatballs as soon as I saw the size of the personal pizza. That was a horrible mistake - they were gross! On a positive note - my dog enjoyed the extra cheat meal.  I'm giving 2 stars because the service great. The gluten free pizza I ordered was also one of the better ones I've had. We will see how the cross contamination goes as the night progresses.   If I went back it would only be for the GF pizza. Highly over rated otherwise!"}
{"text":"Marinara sauce instead of pizza sauce did it for me.  Thin crust is Chicago-THIN style cut into squares, and very tasty as well.  Service was polite and food arrived piping hot.  Location seems small compared to other Spinatos in the valley."}
{"text":"Pizza was much better than I remembered.  Crust came out quite well with just enough crispness and golden color.  Cheese was flavorful, and diced tomatoes were sweet and delicious.  Side of sauce is necessary here because it is so good.  Don't forget to try the Calzones.  I had a small hiccup with service, but otherwise this was a great dining experience and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"The fam and I tried this place out on the recommendation of a coworker. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. The place was packed, and we were told there would be a 10 minute wait for the patio or 20 minutes for indoor. While I wasn't thrilled with sitting outside in Phoenix in the summer heat, there isn't a lot of space in the lobby to wait without being in somebody's way, so we opted for the patio just to have a place to go. Luckily they have a shade screen to protect from the afternoon glare and the misters were on full blast. Overall the place had a nice ambiance and it was not uncomfortable. The service was prompt and friendly. As for the food, we started with a caesar salad and the meatball trio. The salad was pretty typical but still worth it. Skip the meatballs; the sauce on them was exactly the same texture and taste as everyone's favorite eponymous canned pasta product we all grew up with.  Great when you are eight, not so much as a grown-ass adult. Skip it.  For the pizza, we did half Nicole's Old Favorite (red onion, salami, artichoke heart) and half Super Six which is basically a combo. Both were very good. The sauce is definitely sweeter than average, but we have since been able to try another location in Tempe and the sauce there was far less sweet, so be aware there is some variation apparently between sites. For dessert I had the apple pie/crisp type thing that was really good. My wife and daughter tried the tiramisu which they enjoyed. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Five-star customer service all the way... Just awarded best Italian food in Ahwatukee the New Times. People seem to love their pizza sauce but I find it a little sweet. I absolutely loved their garlic bread with cheese... Carryout door is a plus! Emails on your birthday and holidays with great discounts are nice too. The building materials used are top notch and it's an absolutely beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast lunch! Tastes WONDERFUL! So much better than Pizza Hut or Dominoes.  16$ for a med pie to split for three at lunch makes it a pretty good deal.  Don't have to go cups anymore, just bottles :( Overall, I'll be going back a lot!"}
{"text":"When you're not from the area and your toddler is having a meltdown in the car because she's hungry. You look up spots close by, call Spinato's and Ariana answers the phone. You ask her how long the wait is and she says there's wait. AWESOME! You pull into the parking lot 5 minutes later (no lie) and the entire lobby is full of people waiting. You walk up to the host and give her your name and she says, it's about a 25 minute wait. WHAT THE F*CK! I just called from down the street and was told there was no wait (obvious a lie). Morgan, the hostess say...oh, sorry. UGH so irritating!! Don't lie to the people on the phone! Not cool!! Had a feeling multiple people were told the same because as we waited, 3 separate parties asked the hostess how much longer and noted they had all passed their estimated wait time. Front desk needs to get it together for sure!  As a positive...food was good and our server was super nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  We held a surprise birthday lunch for one of our team members and the General Manager, food server Megan, and the rest of their team made sure it was a great success.  We were already fans.  MEB team members are now 'raving fans!'  Thanks Daniel and Team."}
{"text":"Called in, for take out.  Ordered a spaghetti and meatballs calzone, and spaghetti and sausage plate. Very convenient Park and pick up spot, order was ready, no hassle. Brought home to eat in front of the TV. Calzone like a big hunk of heaven! Sweet marinara sauce a perfect fit. Spaghetti just as it should be. No surprise, no problems, a real treat after a grinding work day!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Don't waste your time to pay high prices and get poor service. Skip this place. Only come here if you don't value your time or money."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service!  If you can go on a day that Maria is there you get a true \"Chicago\" experience.  Her attitude is infectious and makes the dining experience all the better for you.  She's only at the Tempe/Smith Rd location so beat it there for a baked spaghetti calzone in vodka sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been to now two locations and love it the same every time. We always order the Chicago and are always pleased. My family is from Chicago and have found our very own taste of home every time we go here.. service is great and quality needs no explaining.. I already miss the city, but know a memory is only around the corner.. try it yourself.. thank me later"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally found this place.  I'm from New Jersey/New York and go to ASU and came to the conclusion that Arizona has NO GOOD pizza places at all, let alone Tempe.  I stumbled upon this place by looking up places that made calzones out here.  That, and everything else tastes amazing here.  The pizza is amazing.  I think it's the sauce and cheese they use that gives it a unique taste that I don't get anywhere else.  The place is a little small and could have a better location (its tucked on a dead street), but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"So my first time here, greeted and seated right away. Waitress was nice, but service was a little slow, several times we waited on drinks, It didn't appear to be overwhelmingly  busy but it is Mother's Day so maybe she had little more tables than she could keep up with. Ordered the super 6 pizza and wings. The pizza was good, love thin crust and yes the pizza is flavorful but a tad sweet. The wings are big and flavorful, we ended up ordering a second order of wings and to our surprise they did not taste the same as the first round so it was inconsistent. We also ordered a brownie with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sorbet, brownie was warm with gooey chocolate, a chocolate lover will enjoy it. The raspberry sorbet was very light and flavorful, not sure if it's homemade but it did taste like it is. Overall it was decent... wouldn't come out of my way to come here but if I was in the neighborhood I might stop here. Idk wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"I kind of burnt out on Spinatos so I thought I would write an update to my review. Their sauce is very sweet and so after a while it is easy to get sick of it. Also, the abundance of sauce makes their pizza not very good leftover since it gets all soggy. Really, I still enjoy eating it once in a while but I am just not as hot for it as I was when I first found this place.  Also, even though they do deliver to our area my hubby and I dined in a couple of times over the last several months and experienced really bad service both times. The first time the waitress completely ignored us the entire time. We had to flag someone else down to get utensils and napkins. The second time we were waited on my a teenage boy who couldn't answer any questions about the pizza toppings or beer list... which I also find very lacking. My new pizza place of choice is Mellow Mushroom. Their pizza is nothing too unique but their beer taps are amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was great....The thin crusted pizza was kind of bland and plain"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints. Good service, sweet sauce and quality consistent pizza. That's all I want!"}
{"text":"If you like pizza with a TON of sugar in it, this is your place.  My husband and I found the pizza to be inedible.  When we complained, the woman behind the bar said that she's give us 10% off the next time we came in.  No thanks.  Worst pizza I've ever had.  If you really like pizza, try Oregano's, Grimaldi's or Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"The gluten-free pizza at this place is amazing. In fact, I'd say it's the best gluten-free pizza I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease seven years ago. Unfortunately, I don't live in Arizona, but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the Valley! We have been eating at Spinatos since I was a child and it is by Far the best Pizza I have had in AZ."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite of ours! There's rarely a wait, it's always clean & inviting, and the servers are friendly. The house-made sauce & Italian sausage are memorably delicious! Because we all have different tastes & dietary needs, the ability to do our own thing without breaking the bank is a great option! Daughter gets her ricotta & spinach, hubby gets his gluten-free crust, and I get lotsa veggies! Don't pass up the appetizers - we love the meatball trio in vodka cream sauce, stuffed mushrooms & garlic cheesebread."}
{"text":"I have got to say I don't know how I lived in Arizona a year without without trying this place! As a Chicago native I am quick to judge pizza because SERIOUSLY nothing compares to what I'm used to (Lou Malnatis and Giordano's). The pizza I had here had the similar buttery crispy crust that I'm used to and had a very good sweet sauce similar to Palermo's. I'm very excited and now I know where to go for pizza! It was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was good but ordered sorbet just got one small scoop next day I ordered the same got four scoops when I told them it was like an oh well and that was on Mother's Day . Waitress was like .. very ...could be better"}
{"text":"An absolute gem in N. Scottsdale.  The pizza is fantastic, the salads great, and the service always top notch.  I usually go thin crust sausage and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say, this is the pinnacle if pizza for me.  Thin crust, slightly sweet sauce....great sausage.  I can't express how good of a pie this is.  Order with confidence."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Spinato's. We usually have our pizza delivered, and each time the delivery has always been prompt and the delivery person friendly. We have eaten there as well, and we really enjoy the commeraderie with other patrons and with the servers. Maria is our favorite server.  We have been choosing the gluten-free pizza recently, and it is just as delicious as the regular crust pizza. We love Da Greek and the Chicago style pizzas."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Scottsdale. Their sauce is unforgettable.  i usually order take out, but the atmosphere is great and service is super.  If you're in this corner of the country and up for pizza this place is a don't miss."}
{"text":"Have been going to spinato's for quite some time and have never had a bad experience.   They have the best tasting crust around and generally my family leaves the crust for the dogs but with spinato's the dogs do not get any treats.  My favorite pizza is the \"Get Meaty\" which has sausage, pepperoni, ham and Italian beef. I good mix of meats and is loaded in total weight.   No matter what what pizza you order they will cook it to your liking. Have had the Italian bread which is good but don't get filled up on it before the pizza arrives.  Lime this location but generally have been going to the 7th street location on the way home from work.   Will be back again for more pizza.

{"text":"Simply one of the best pizzas in town!   Great new location with a huge dining area and separate take out area in a large parking shopping plaza.  Use to always go to the one on Glendale Rd before they moved here and fought for parking and elbow to elbow inside..  Now to the food, generally order the \"Get Meaty\" Pizza and Cheese or Margarita. Generally we don't eat the crust but it is so good and sweet hate to not eat the crust. The pizza is always cooked perfectly and generously piled with what ever you put in it. Love the sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.   Love the small business family owned business and will support them as much as possible rather than eat the big chain pizza places.   Have been to the one in Tempe, North Phoenix and Central Phoenix and will come back to all or whatever is closest."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The cheese ravioli is so incredibly creamy and the vodka sauce is on point. Pizza is always delicious and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best italian (pizza/calzones) that we've had.  Wife loves the spinach calzone...i love the get meaty pizza.  Great atmosphere for family, etc."}
{"text":"I cannot give 5 stars mostly for one reason. By restroom seeting. Put up a partition separating the restooms from the dinning area it is not hard...  Once you can get a table that is not in the restroom it is a very comfortable and nicely decorated environment.  This is also the first place that I've been to that did a wrong order right.  None of this \"Sorry we screwed up your order we'll make it right for you but we have to take the wrong one back\", and you'll just sit here getting more hungry as your dining party gets to finish their food. The server volenrarialy offered to let me keep the messed up order while waiting for the correct one, and didn't charge me for the meal. What else are you gonna do sell it to the next person that orders the same thing? I never understood that. But this location did it right. So yeah a couple of things went wrong but they properly corrected them. For that they get extra credit.  -- just noticed a typographic error while reviewing and corrected it."}
{"text":"I really do think servers can make or break the dining experience.  My last experience simply was horrible, but tonight, Monday, I was served by Anna, who is the bartender.  My food was hot and my order was correct.   Other server could learn from her in how to make the customer have a good experience.  The pizza was good tonight.  Thank you"}
