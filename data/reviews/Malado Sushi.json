{"text":"I searched online for a restaurant near by with great sushi at reasonable prices and came across this restaurant on yelp.

My significant other and I went out for dinner at Malado and were excited with the booth setting they have. We ordered our food and were really surprised with the low prices.

We got our dinner served and my significant other started to eat his order and noticed hair in his meal!!!!!!!

EW!

We were too shy to say anything about it and we ended up sharing the order I ate since it seemed \"ok\".

Due to the hair in the foods I have rated Malado low, but aside for that their prices are great and the atmosphere is a nice experience."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. The food is fantastic,portions are right and owners really cut. Fish in sushi were fresh, they give me a soup as starter and a little vegetable dessert without asking.I really appreciated that.Coming back soon"}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 3 times and I love eating here. I've tried a lot of the dishes on the menu, and I enjoyed them all. The moment you enter you get a Japanese/Korean vibe from the decor. Once you're inside you will most likely be greeted by one of the family members (usually the son or daughter).

The food is very authentic. It's beyond comfort Japanese and Korean food and there is a great consistency with the entire experience. If you get a chance, sit in one of the enclosed booths. Once you get all of your food they will unfurl the shades, enclosing your booth from the outside.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant!!! We have gone there many times lunch time!!
The owners are very nice and friendly
The food is the best...very fresh sushi, the kalbi is nice and chewy, tempura is light and flaky. They have lunch specials but even if you order from the regular menu it's still worth it as they give you so much food! We're always coming out of there full & happy!  :)  
Easy mall to find parking."}
{"text":"Great food, very good quality sushi. Staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable. Perfect little place that will ht the spot."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant. I have been there around five times. Servers are super nice. Food is great."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little Japanese/Korean eatery! The owners are very sweet, the seating is quaint (Especially if you can get the booth) but most importantly the food is excellent and well priced! all of the Maki rolls we had were great (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, yam, California, avocado, cucumber), the calamari for $6.50 was some of tastiest I've had and although portion was smaller it was right for the price. 

Next time I will try the Korean cuisine and if it's anything like the Japanese I'm already salivating!"}
{"text":"I was here 4/17/2018 Tuesday evening.  My work colleague searched this one out and was only 15 minutes from our hotel in Vaughan.  This little place is a gem.  I have been to Korea numerous times and knew what I like and don't.  Great Korean food and the condiments are top notch.  Typical Korean condiments and the daikon was my favorite.  I had the seafood pancake appetizer and it was HUGE with lots of seafood including generous squid.  I had dot sot bulgogi bibimbop and my colleague had a bossam jungsik.  All great and the staff was polite and attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.  At first I thought $15CDN was a lot for a seafood pancake it was big enough to justify.  

If you go to this small place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time checking out this restaurant and it'll now be our go-to for Japanese.  I was a bit worried at first as we were the first ones in for dinner but then within half an hour, about ten other patrons came, whew!

We enjoyed our teriyaki and tempura bento boxes; tried both salmon and beef.  First came a mini vermicelli soup and small fried fish bites; we thought this was unique.  Our bento boxes came with miso soup, salmon/beef, udon noodles, house salad, two pieces of California rolls, rice and five tempura pieces.  Food was tasty, no complaints, fast service and for $9.95, we were really amazed with the spread.  We've been to several other sushi restaurants on Dixon and Steeles and this place offers way better value.  I like having variety in my entrees and especially likes the nice variety in my bento boxes.  Took a look at the prices for their other offerings as well and they are very well-priced.  Will make it a point to try other items next time.  Glad we discovered this place!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came half an hour after they opened around 11 and were seated in their empty restaurant. However, as lunch time was approaching, many more customers began to come in. I got the pop combo which consisted of a can of pop, dukbukki, and tonkatsu (pork fried cutlet but I originally thought it was chicken) for $14.99. Initially, I thought it was a steal because dukbukki alone is around $10 and with tonkatsu, it should be a huge deal! But the dukbukki was in a smaller bowl than I've had last time when I ordered it separately. It was still delicious with the chewy and spicy rice cakes. The cutlet was on the dry side but it was still good. It was served with a side of saucy penne pasta, a side of lettuce and other veggies, and some radish to clean my palate. 

Overall, it was a pretty good deal considering they gave us some complimentary noodles and soup with an abundance of their 6 side dishes. Services was great, our waiter checked up on us 3-4 times (not annoying) asking if everything was okay or if we needed any side dishes."}
{"text":"I live at Yonge and Eglington but have to drive my son to soccer practice in Downsview. We found this tiny place in a strip mall off of Finch and decided to give it a go. We've had a lot of sushi since moving to Toronto but hands down this is the best sushi I've had in Toronto! Prices are very good especially for what you get. We ordered 4 rolls between the two of us because we couldn't narrow it down. The rolls were HUGE! I could barely fit one roll in my mouth! All four rolls tasted amazing! The fish was fresh and the interior of the rolls were rolled with an abundance of ingredients, not mostly rice like other places. Big portions of avocado or crab, cucumber etc. It was so good. My son who will opt for sushi any chance he gets said this was the best sushi he has ever had. 
The service was very friendly and they give you complimentary tea, miso soup and another kind of soup while you wait for them to make the rolls. 
We will definitely be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"The rating speaks the truth. Food was excellent prices were comparable and the atmosphere was perfect"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome customer service and great food! The owners are super sweet and generous. My family and I come here all the time for every event we manage to celebrate with each other."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Complimentary green tea. Ordered California rolls which were DELICIOUS! Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have tried this place if it weren't for my sister. I was craving Korean and rather than going to the typical Yonge/Finch area she suggested that we go here. 

The restaurant has Korean and Japanese food so we ordered a mixture of both. We ordered pork bone soup, takoyaki, and Malado roll. The ban chan here is pretty standard but what sets it apart from other restaurants is that we were given a small bowl of noodles in soup, which was perfect because it was cold outside that day.

The portions here are on the bigger side. My sister and I split everything and we weren't able to finish, we had to take the Malado roll home. All the dishes we ordered tasted good and as I've said before, generous portions. The service is here is okay, exactly what you would expect in a Korean restaurant. 

Overall my experience here was good and I'm definitely coming back to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Very kind family business. Love the decor. The Benton box comes with soup and is quite good. Area is weird but restaurant us great!"}
{"text":"I have been to Malado many times because it's so close to home. It's a small family owned restaurant that's got the feel of a mom and pop shop. They have a pretty extensive menu of Korean and Japanese dishes. Their Korean dishes are far superior to their Japanese choices (probably because the family is Korean). The sashimi/sushi are not high quality, however the price isn't too high so you do get what you pay for. 

I always get a pork/kimchi with tofu dish called tofu samkeapsal on the menu (I looked it up and it's called dubu kimchi, not sure why Malado calls it the other name). It comes with a serving of purple rice as well. During lunch they have daily special bento boxes that are a fantastic value. Most of the time I always end up taking food home, despite having quite a large appetite. 

After you order they'll give you a small complimentary noodle soup and then bring out the banchan consisting of kimchi, pickled daikon, beansprouts and some other things. It changes from time to time. 

Service is sometimes hit or miss. If you sit in one of the separate booths you'll have to constantly be peaking out to call them if you need anything. But, they are nice when you do call them so that's not really a big issue. 

Parking is easily found in the lot right outside."}
{"text":"This place is the best food. I live around the corner and go at lest once a week. I recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! You gotta try it. I eat here 2-3 times a month. 

Boyfriend and I really love the somen appetizer. Temperature of the somen soup is not consistent as they keep the soup base in the hot water dispenser and just pour over the noodles when they're ready to serve you. I really love the soup especially when I'm so hungry and need something before the main dish actually comes out so I don't mind cold warm or hot somen . 

Best gamjatang I've ever tried, never disappoints me. Just the right amount of flavour and spice to it. Every bowl I got only had 1 piece of potatoe though which is fine not a big deal. 

Owner and servers are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super good and fast service. Food was delicious. Beef sauté was just amazing. They even provided us with free miso soup. I recommand."}
{"text":"Cost is reasonable quality of food is horrible. The served my pork bone soup cold it felt like from
Fridge n pot in stove for few minute happen twice will not again.

Order a bento box sashimi one time the fish was still frozen with ice. Their tempura batter was still uncook from inside complaint and they did nothing.
Very unhappy with the woman waitress took her 30minutes to bring my rice with my food i have to remind her. Her service was bad"}
{"text":"My spouse decided to take me to Malado for an adventure for our usual Friday night outing, and I was really impressed with this place. Malado is located in the same plaza where we usually have our pho'.  The quality of the sashimi was worth the price. We also tried their beef soup( forgot the name) but we'd prefer to have it at our go- to tofu soup place in Mississauga next time.
Service was prompt, which was really good. We had a happy meal:)"}
{"text":"Really good bento boxes! I had the chicken katsu bento box and it came within ten minutes. You also get an extra complimentary soup with noodles and miso soup, all for $11.99. The plaza does get busy so it might be hard to find parking, but other than that I would go back to try more of the menu as they offer many Korean and Japanese dishes."}
{"text":"I tried Malado sushi yesterday evening. After looking at reviews on yelp I decided to try this restaurant. 

Service was quick and ordering was easy. The restaurant is cozy but clean. 

Sushi was fresh and although I ordered take out sashimi the presentation was nice. Hand rolls tasted good as well . I will definitely come back with my Family to dine in"}
{"text":"I'm confused how this place has so many great ratings. It's a hole-in-the-wall, which I'm fine with. Sometimes those places throw down, but in this case? The atmosphere matched the food. It was awful. Shumai were microwaved to an inedible temperature, when they cooled, were rock hard. The seaweed salad arrived partially frozen. The spicy tuna roll? I have no idea what it was. See the photo. It was a ton of breading? Mayo just on the top? Brown tuna? I left hungry and went to Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"I adore the gamjatang from this small momma papa place. It's small but personable and the food has never let me down! I've had many items and not a single disappointment here. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing value. Cozy setup and very friendly staff. Loved the sashimi and bento box selection."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look appealing on the outside. But it's gem, the food is so good, and the service was wonderful. I ordered the volcano sushi. It was really good."}
{"text":"I came here on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed.

Prices here for Korean or Japanese dish is well priced.  Portions are great.
I am always on a hunt for great JamJang and it is one of the tastiest for $10
My friend got the Salmon and Tempura bento box $12.  They have a great tempura dipping sauce and sides included miso soup, chap chae, salad and 2 nice (?) rolls.

Service was on point too!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and I recently decided to go there after work with my sister. The menu is extremely extensive, so many dishes to pick from. My sister got the bimbimbap and she liked it. I ordered the salmon sashimi bento box at a really good price. The fish tasted great and the quality of the tempura was just as delicious. I will for sure come back here again!!"}
{"text":"tried this new korean japanese restaurant. Octopus bibimbab and cold noodle were great"}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service when it's really busy. Needs more server help. They forgot my wife's food. By the time the dish came out. It was wrong and I had finish eating all my food. Ended up just canceling her order. Seriously need more servers."}
{"text":"Have been working in the area for 5.5 years but never try this Korean/ Japanese restaurant. So instead of going for Pho, I gave this restaurant a try. Went there around 3:15 and there is no one in the restaurant.  The menu is very extensive full of different types of Korean and Japanese, I've ordered Bibim Naeng Myun ( buckwheat cold noodles with spicy sauce) for take out. Aside from the noodle it came with 2 side dishes, kimchi and bean sprouts and soup.  Cold noodle is very yummy especially with this hot weather, noodles are cold and chewy, with pickled radish inside. Also have 4 pieces of beef brisket and hard boil egg. Soup that came with it taste good too. Will definitely buy take out from them again"}
