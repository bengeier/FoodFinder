{"text":"I had the beef stew with nshima, side of beans and side of sweet potatoes. The food was delicious and good sized portions, especially liked their homemade spicy sauce. The cooks were very sweet, highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place just opened at the Lincoln square in Urbana. Traditional African fresh made food by the owners. I will recommend to try this place. The sweet potatoes that came with the delicious chicken curry were amazing, the meat pies are fantastic , prices are reasonable, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING! I had the chicken curry and the chicken was so tender and juicy, the potatoes so perfectly soft and have absorbed the flavor from the curry sauce, the rice was the perfect texture and carried the chicken and potatoes well and the beans I ordered with it were so fucking good

My friend ordered the oxtail with nshima and green and plantains on the side. I can't stress enough how amazing it was, I got to try the oxtail with nshima and it was so juicy and tender and their plantains were PERFECT! I recommend coming here if you get the chance, try their food, and leave a big tip

I'm honestly going to be a regular here"}
