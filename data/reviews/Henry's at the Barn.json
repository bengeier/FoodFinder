{"text":"This is one of the outer West Side's best kept secrets. Every time I go to Henry's, I am amazed that there are not crowds lining up out the door. Maybe it's hard to find (turn in at the Avon Police Station lot and keep going!), but boy, is it good. Paul, the owner and chef, has a very finely tuned palate and a talent for hiring sincere, efficient and friendly staff. The menu is a little overwhelming when you first try to take it in, since you will want to try everything on your first visit. Of course, you won't be able to accomplish that. It all sounds so delicious, and it is. Try the onion soup. It is the perfect realization of the classic: not too thick nor too thin, beefy and oniony (with the onion cut into dice instead of those hard-to-eat slices!) the crouton isn't too thick, the cheese is just right and doesn't control the dish. This is the way Henry's does every dish they cook. Every element is well considered and thought out. The seafood is fresh and the meats are succulent. The vegetable sides are fascinating and different. Where can you get okra as a side dish? Collard greens? Brussels sprouts? Henry's. Where can you get lightly roasted plump oysters with a fresh Ohio sweet corn relish? Henry's. Where can you get the creamiest, yummiest grits subtly flavored in so many ways (bleu cheese, goat cheese, and on and on, all in tune with what they are served with)? Henry's. Where can you get an entree that is perfectly sized so that you can actually have soup, salad, main course and a bite of a great dessert (they may get their desserts from the gourmet shop/bakery next door) and not feel like Orca the whale? Henry's. In addition, Henry's doesn't rake you over the coals on the wine pricing. Here is an example of a special we had the other night: Huge sea scallops dusted with allspice, cinnamon and cloves, seared perfectly, on a bed of creamy bleu cheese grits and topped by a dollop of caramelized fresh pear. Unbelievably delicious. You owe it to yourself to make it there. Every person we've ever taken there loves it and goes back repeatedly. They have a really wonderful patio. There's lots of parking. Hurry, go to Henry's before you can't get in!"}
{"text":"Henry's at the Barn is an excellent restaurant featuring the cuising of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Located in Olde Avon Village, it is hidden off of Detroit, making it hard to find if you don't know the area. Just look out for Olde Avon Village and it's in there. The restaurant is housed inside an old barn that was transported and renovated to the beauty it is today. You walk inside and immediately, the wonderfully friendly nature of the service helps you. Reservations are recommended, which we were unaware of. They were just fine with that and we were seated in a nice table in the really nice bar. There is a large dining room, a lounge upstairs with a large TV and memorabilia on the walls, and a great outdoor patio with a fire pit, just to give you the other dining options. The patio is considered one of the best patio's on the West Side, according to Cleveland Magazine. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful, and the hostess came back to check on us often, just to show you the great service. Just a warning, your experience will drag on, so be prepared. It took us two hours from when we walked in to when we left, but it was well worth it, as you're about to see. First, I ordered peel & eat shrimp with an excellent, albeit hot, cocktail sauce. Just a tip, order the peel & eat shrimp instead of the shrimp cocktail, as you get more shrimp for less ($7 for cocktail, $5 for peel & eat). The only drawback is you have to peel your own shrimp, which is no big deal. They also provide you with bread with three excellent toppings, a spicy goat cheese, which I can't seem to remember the ingredient spicing it up, a spicy mango sauce, which the name I also can't remember, and a honey butter. I loved the goat cheese and the mango sauce, but I wasn't so hot about the honey butter. The sweet and salty cream thing just doesn't work for me. Then the main course came. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, which came with collards with tomatoes, black eyed peas, and blue cheese hushpuppies. Everything was great on that plate, with the exception of the collards. There was some sort of dressing or something on it that was too strong. For dessert, I ordered what I think was called a truffle (it wasn't a chocolate truffle). It was berries and cake with whipped cream. I don't get why it was called a truffle, but I digress. It was excellent. I really enjoyed it. Overall, this was a great meal that reminded me of Ohio's favorite vacation spot, Hilton Head, one of my favorite vacation spots. It is worth the drive from anywhere in Greater Cleveland, especially if you love the South Carolina Lowcountry. (Sorry about forgetting names of dishes, I usually remember those things)."}
{"text":"henry's is a beautiful restaurant with very attentive staff.  We had a reservation for 8.  When we got their the table ahead of us was running late.  We had a drink at the bar and soon we were seated.  Our waiter, Ed, was able to get them to go to the bar so we could get our table.  Ed was very helpful, as I am not an expert in southern low-country cuisine.  My husband went with the Kobe beef- the sweet potatoes that came on the side were delicious.  I had shellfish boil  with rice,  sausage  peppars and onions that was cooked to perfection and a cup of crab soup that had a nice kick to it!~
Everything looked and tasted devine!
It is hard to see off of Detroit road, unless you know what you are looking for."}

{"text":"Henry's at the Barn is actually a restaurant/ bar that incorporates a 100-150 year old barn.  The restaurant features an upscale version of Carolina Low Country cooking.  The bar features cozy, cozy cuddliness, especailly in the loft.

My BFF (best foodie friend) took me there for my birthday.  Such a present, that was!  The menu was recently updated for fall.  Such a menu!

THE FOOD: Carolina Low country cuisine is southern (South Carolinian) cooking infulenced by the proximity to astounding seafood.  Expect spicy and salty flavors, delicately battered and fried preparations and devistatingly good seafood.

On previous visits I.. enjoyed?... nearly fainted over?... grew entirely too passionate about? the shrimp/ andouille grits.  Perfectly tender shrimp, spicy slices of andouille, creamy grits and heavy cream.  Purrrrr.  I've had their cold bowls-- either raw or chilled seafood served with a medly of dipping sauces including a subtle mustard.  

Tonight BFF and I went all out.  We started with cocktails-- I had a whiskey sour that was NOT made with cheap-ass sour mix.  It was a true cocktail.  BFF had a Manhattan which he proclaimed perfect.  For apps, I had fried green tomatoes.  The batter was crisp and flaky and the tomatoes were tart.  I would have sliced the tomatoes a bit thinner-- they were not completely warmed.  BFF had the scallops seared with cinnamon.  That could so easily be awful.  It was perfect.  the scallops were egg white tender and the tiny mist of REAL cinnamon was slightly charred.  The sweet potato cake that came with it was sweet, but still had a bit of tooth to it.

I had the Frogmorton Stew-- a giant bowl of oysters, clams, shrimp, mussles and andouille in a spicy broth with a giant slab of insane garlic toast.  It was astounding.  All the seafood was done perfectly-- despite the different sizes of each piece, each was cooked to its individual perfect doneness.  The broth was peppery-- we had fun sopping it up with the giant crouton.

BFF had the strip steak-- an odd choice given the venue, but it turned out to be exquisite.  The steak must have been a good grass-fed, well aged bit o' cow.  It was tender and complex and buttery.  It was exactly medium rare (What do we want?  Steak!  How do we want it? Medium Rare!!!!)  The sauce was subtle and not overpowering.  The sides were a good mix of sweet and savory.

Dessert was disappointing.  The place buys them from a bakery.  Nothing is made in-house.  The red velvet cake was simply white cake colored red, instead of the rich, dense stuff it should be.  The icing was the proper boiled kind.  The tiramisu was not, in fact, tiramisu.  It was marscapone on top of some sort of ladyfinger, sprinkled with chocolate shavings.  Good in it's own way, but not tiramisu.

The wine list was excellent, including a 25 under $25 list that was grand!

THE ATMOSPHERE:  The bar portion of the building is the coolest place to get a drink ever.  it is built inside the old barn portion of the building-- with a river rock foundation and gothic revival wooden walls.  The loft is the place-- featuring giant, overstuffed leather couches and portraits of dogs!!!  Had I gone with a sweetie, I would have insisted on cuddling up there.  As I was not, we left the space to the sweeties.  These areas are super popular, so they fill up immediately on weekends.  You stand a better chance on a weekday.

The dining room has been improved.  Before, it was a drafty cold place covered in french-ish fabrics.  It looked like the grille room at a country club.  The space has been revised with the addition of rough hewn beams which separate the high loft-like ceiling space from the dining room.  It is much cozier now.  Still, I wish they would lose some of the toile and the bad art and let the place get a bit more Low Country.

THE SERVICE:  Eric, the waiter is the best waiter!!!  He had good and candid information about the menu.  When he didn't know an answer to our annoying foodie questions, he found out.  As we are a chatty bunch of foodies, we ended up talking and laughing with him all night.

I wish there was such a thing as 4.5 stars.  .5  off for the sad, sad  desserts.

 I love it anyways.  Wants me sommore grits!!!"}
