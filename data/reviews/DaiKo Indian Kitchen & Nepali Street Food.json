{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on Friday based on a friend's recommendation. Greeted by the friendly wait staff. They had a nice selection of local craft beer, and we enjoyed a couple with the _very_ spicy and delicious edamame appetizer along with the complimentary lobster butter popcorn. Mains were delicious. Servers were very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Made reservation for a party of 7 online. The restaurant is not even open. No one called or explained that they were not open even though I got an email confirming my reservation. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So happy to have stumbled across this place. Great service and excellent food. We ordered the lunch special for $6.99 and it was really delicious. Flavorful and filling!  Just the right amount of spice!  Highly highly suggest coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Came in the other night and I must say the food was amazing. I had the Cauliflower, Momos and Tacos which were delicious. The drinks were superb. I had their old fashion and cool story bro. For my third drink I couldn't decide so the bartender came over and asked me what I liked in flavors and came back with a personal cocktail just for me.  Service top notch! Food great! And the DJ was perfect! I was able to still have a conversation with my partner."}
{"text":"I looked around online tonight to find something interesting and new to try for dinner. We were originally looking for something Asian but then I came across Daiko. Both Yelp and Blog TO had favorable reviews so we headed to Queen West.

What an interesting and completely satisfying find!! It was early evening and the place wasn't busy. I'll start off by saying the service was fantastic! Andie (sp?) was great. Even though we found out she was very new to Daiko, she made some solid recommendations, stirred up some top-notch cocktails, and was perfectly attentive, relaxed and engaging.

We stared with a complimentary small bowl of popcorn with lobster butter. Subtle and yummy, a perfect appetite pique. I had the Cool Story Bro cocktail and my partner the #1 Love Parkdale. Delicious, especially the Dillon's rose gin in the Parkdale. 

They had a seafood platter special, which my partner ordered, and I had the tandoori fried chicken. The seafood platter was a beautiful flavour excursion. Some of the tastiest and most tender calamari, yummy crab cake, interesting tuna tartare, grilled spiced shrimp, asparagus and potato hash. So good!

But the chicken. Crunchy, juicy, mildly spicy, with an Indian-inspired salsa verde dipping sauce. I'll go back just for the fried chicken. Andie recommended the cauliflower as a side, rather than the fries. It was so good we ordered another side of it, even though it wasn't on the menu. Cheesy coconut milk cream sauce, toothsome cauliflower and crunchy breadcrumbs on top. Fantastic. 

Although we were comfortably stuffed, I noticed masala chai brûlée on the specials board. I'm a huge brûlée fan and just had to try this. What a revelation! The top could use a touch more sugar for that satisfying initial crack with a spoon, but otherwise this dessert was perfection!! Creamy and rich, but light and refreshing. The presentation was superb, in fact all of the food was beautifully presented. 

So happy to find this little gem on Queen West. We will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here on a Saturday for brunch. I was so impressed with the service and quality of food for the price they are offering. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it so much we came back the following evening for dinner. I highly recommend this for the atmosphere, service and price point. Very unique flavours, and we'll executed."}
{"text":"Great food and warm service.  Our host/server introduced us to a Nepalese dish that she always asks her family for, when she returns to Nepal.  We are so grateful she shared it with us.  All of their food was just dreamy, we can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered via just eat, they completely forgot one item and there was no recourse. They said they are too busy to deliver the missing item. Guy on the phone didnt seem too bothered about it.

Too busy? So they will rather provide shoddy service to more customers rather than good service to fewer?

Beware of ordering online from here, you may or may not get everything you paid for."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!

We ordered a few dishes on a Saturday night using delivery service. For four people, we ordered three dishes, Bhaigan Bhartha, Bhindi Masala, Saag Paneer plus naan and rice. 

Everything we tried was delicious and well-prepared. The stand-out of the night was the Bhaigan Bhartha, a classic Punjabi dish of roasted eggplant with spices and tomato. It was rich, spicy and slightly sweet. Sooo good! 

I can't wait to try their other dishes!!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. Service top notch,food pretty good. Outing one both I and my ccompanion and I arrived at the restaurant without our reading glasses. The server kindly offered to let us use his to peruse the menu which was in small font. Upon being seated we were offered a bowl of popcorn infused with lobster butter. There was no discernible taste of lobster. There was a lot of butter and Parmesan cheese and there was probably lobster but I could not taste it. Neither could my companion.
For an app I had water buffalo tartare and my companion had grilled sardine. The tartare came served in a circular portion topped with a mottled quail egg and surrounded by sliced pickles. You were also given a few prawn chips to scoop it up with. To my taste buds water buffalo tartare taste no different than regular beef tartare. Tasty though.

Our companion enjoyed her pan seared sardine which also came with polenta side. Her name was the cheezy lamb burger which was cooked well and came with pretty good fries.
My main was a Lamb shank and it was braised tenderly. Bill before tip was $92 for the two two appetizers, 2 mains, two glasses of wine, cosmopolitan.

On my second trip with a different companion we ordered the tandoori fried chicken to start, and we both had lamb burgers. The Tandoori fried chicken was cooked perfectly although there was no discernible taste of lemon in the marinade. Both or lamb burgers were cooked properly. My companion sweet potato fries were to her liking in my regular fries were fine also. The service, again, was excellent. 
I will return."}
{"text":"First time eating nepalese food. Mmm, very yummy!! Went here because of groupon (but the real reason is because of the restaurant's high rating). We ordered lamb and chicken. Flavor is very different (in a good way) & 'lighter' than indian food. Service was very good as well. Definitely will come back to try other food (even though it takes us 1.5hr by bus & subway to get there)."}
{"text":"I cannot not even describe the rotten food that I had gotten from here. I have tried almost every Indian restaurant in the GTA and never encountered food that is rotten and sour. I had ordered appetizers and two curries. I ordered the samosas and 2 paneer makhani curries. When the food arrived through delivery, I knew something was wrong.

ONE: samosa was soggy and tasted frozen

TWO: the curry container was 90 % gravy that I thought they forgot to put the paneer inside until I dug a spoon into the container to find 12 TINY cubes of paneer on the bottom. 

THREE: when I was eating the paneer curry with my friends, the butter and cream based paneer makhani gravy was SOUR. Like sour milk. It was disgusting. I have never had sour curry gravy.

Indian restaurants will make their cream and onion gravy's in large buckets and when they have less customers, the gravy will turn sour and clearly the restaurant did not want to throw it out and STILL give it to the customers.

I really hope the chef throws out those curry gravies that are turning rotten and sour. Please don't sabotage customer's health by stretching your revenues to cover the expenses.

There was no excuse why the restaurant gave customer sour curry when they knew it went bad. Especially when your restaurant barely have any customers on a regular basis and you have all this food sitting in your fridge.


DEFINITELY won't be ordering from Daiko again. The sour curry you have given me is unacceptable !!"}
{"text":"Update: Went back and really enjoyed our meal! They reworked the menu and it makes a lot more sense now - Indian and Nepali, less eclectic. Service was really friendly!"}
{"text":"Indian at its finest.  I took my girlfriend here because I had an un-redeemed Groupon voucher that I bought when I was drunk months ago and forgot to use. Thanks to this visit, we'll be back many times over I'm sure.

Location:  Parkdale.  Not my favourite part of the city to walk around in at night, but the food options here will drag me back.  

Ambience:  The interior of this place is rather rustic.  The painted walls have murals that are quite fine to look at and the tables are well spaced out.  It has a very authentic feel, though I've never been to India/Nepal, so I can't really gauge that, but it feels authentic.  Old-style worn decorations that have chipped paint makes me feel like I'm somewhere else.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and quiet, and the lighting is dim.  I love this.

Food:  I can say that this could in fact be the best Indian food I've had in Toronto.  Ever.  The sauces are complex yet subtle, and the meat was tender.  So tender that I had no trouble separating it with my spoon. I ordered the chicken karahi, and was warned that there was a level of spice, and while it did have me wiping my nose frequently and battling to quell the flames at times, the heat did nothing to rob me of taking in the complex mixture of spices, peppers, and onion that made up the sauce.  I highly recommend ordering a lemon soda (Nimbu Pani).  This is not something from a can or concentrate, rather they make it at the bar.  As far as I can tell, it's unflavoured and unsweetened soda mixed with black salt and raw lemon.  It's not full of sugar and is quite refreshing. 

Service:  I have no problems with the service here.  Our server was friendly, professional and happy to accommodate our questions about menu items.

Cons:  I couldn't find much about this place that left me unsatisfied.  The portion size, while not massive, is just enough to fill you up without impacting your ability to walk.  It would be great if rice or naan was included in the main, but this is common with most Indian restaurants I've been to.  The menu could be more descriptive in the Nepalese section, because \"Nepalese Style\" doesn't give the average customer much information. All of the above points add up to about %10 of a star rating, so a full five star is warranted.

I'll be back here.  I didn't try anything from the Nepalese options, which needs to be remedied.  The ambience alone makes this a place that I can visit and know I will be comfortable in, which is not common in this city.  It's hard to find a restaurant that isn't loud, with loud music, and bright lights - things I dislike in other words. And the food of course, is of high quality.  It's a shame that this place wasn't busy.  I'm writing this review in hopes that after reading it, more people will check out Daiko, because this type of attention to detail deserves to prosper."}
{"text":"I'm looking forward to returning to this new Parkdale spot. We had a delicious brunch today: the omelette special and the poutine hash with Peking duck. Poutine was decadent! Omelette was tasty. Good coffee. Fast and friendly service. I'll be back to try the daily specials and regular menu. There are a lot of different Asian inspired dishes to try!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here tonight. Tried the samosas and pakora, a warm Nepalese chicken salad, the muttar paneer, lamb saag, and eggplant. Delicious food, family-run, excellent friendly service. Good value for money. 
The restaurant is very clean and pleasantly decorated. 
I believe from other reviews that the menu has changed and there is new management? Whatever the changes, they seem to be only for the better. 
We're going to be back often!"}
{"text":"Ordered in last night and was appalled at the quality of the meat.  Chicken consisted of the cut off end of a chicken thigh with veins and fat. THATS IT. The lamb more chewy then gum. After trying to bite through it for a few minutes I finally had to spit it out. Tried a few more pieces no better.
I honestly haven't seen such terrible quality meat in a very long time. 
Will never order again. It could have been excellent. The sauces were spot on but the meat was a HUGE TURN OFF."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat if you are a Nepali/Indian food fanatic. Tried the food there when we went on a vacation in Toronto and we were not disappointed. 

Five Stars all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered daiko in, and didn't get half the order.   They brought part of the dinner order, and despite a promise to bring the rest it never came.   This is insulting for the money paid, and ONE SHOULD NEVER EAT HERE."}
{"text":"This is a very nice spot, by all measures. 
The atmosphere was nice, with low unobtrusive lighting and pleasantly painted walls (with a few feel-good cheesy sayings overlaid). 
The food was decent. I ordered the lamb karahi thali, which is a combo deal that got me a lamb karahi entree with a host of other sides for an eminently reasonable price (only $15, and less if you get a veggie entree). The main and sides were all tasty and pleasant, however the lamb of my main was pretty overcooked. Still, a fantastic deal, and a good meal. 
The best part of my experience was the service. The server was patient, attentive, and generous. I ordered the nimbu pani (a south Asian lemon soda), which I didn't realize would be salty, and I asked him if I could return it and order a mango lassi instead. He did me one better by getting me the lassi and only charging me for the (decidedly cheaper) soda. 
Overall, food/price ratio is great, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Happily visited this Indian/Nepalese restaurant on a weeknight recently. Filling the building that used to be home to the Geraldine, I'm happy to see something good come and put this lovely space to use.

And good news, the food is great!
From the samosas and mixed vegetable pakoras to start, to the chicken tikka masala and chicken madras mains, we really enjoyed the meal. The madras had a nice spice to it which is perfect for cold days like what we're dealing with currently.

The beer selection is pretty good with craft options on tap including a few High Park Brewing beers, and glasses of wine were reasonably priced too. 

Our server was attentive and seemed to really aim to please, which always bodes well for getting my return business. In the mean time, I'll give the place 4 stars and a full recommendation for you Yelp readers to go and have a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Lentil stew, and Samosas. Staff very friendly. Next time again...."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered take out (delivery) from here but I must say, it's the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Their Lamb Korma is to DIE for. I am addicted to it. Their lamb Vindaloo is also very good but that Korma ummm ummmm good - no GREAT! Their delivery is fast and efficient and the one time that they were a bit late the restaurant called me to let me know where they driver was. I shall one day go in person and dine there but their delivery comes hot and the portions are large so I always have lots left over for lunch the next day. Plenty of sauce to scoop up with their excellent naan too."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out twice and the food is delicious! Our server today was very friendly and helped us navigate the menu (my parents are new to Indian food). We ordered the chicken korma, the butter chicken, aloo ghobi, basmati, naan and mango lassis. While we waited, we were served water and delicious papadums. The food was piping hot, fresh and very tasty. 

The prices are reasonable and the ambiance is nice. I will update once I've had a chance to dine in. The place was empty while we were waiting but our server said they were very busy doing delivery orders (we waited about 20 minutes but didn't mind because we were treated well). Will definitely be back for dinner and their lunch special on weekdays."}
{"text":"Worst momos ever. Chicken or veggies never ever order from here ever plus waiting time is like 30 minutes worst experience ever. So far tried all the parkdale for momos . But this was worst"}
{"text":"This place is a gem on Queen Street east. After walking long Lake shore my partner and I stumbled upon daiko. The interior was fresh and spacious with lots of fresh air coming in from the patio. We ordered the pine apple sauced wings along with the lamb burgers. Let us tell you. It was amazing and flavourful. Definitely worth a taste if you're around the area. The food was really good so my partner and I ordered the taco duo which was a burst of flavour. 

Johney who was our server was great and very welcoming. Definitely worth a try and is a safe spot to go to if you're a local."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon which was $40 for food for four people, I think I paid around $25 for it but don't remember exactly and that particular deal is no longer available on the site. Anyway, I've been to other Indian restaurants purchasing a voucher for food for four people and only bringing one other person and it was never an issue. This time after ordering the food, the guy tells me he won't accept the voucher because 4 people aren't there. On the spot,  I had to buy the $12 for $20 deal for 2 in which each person only saves a measly $4. I wouldn't have gone if I had known beforehand. The waiter would not give 2 separate bills with $10 taken off each bill but said the whole $20 must only be taken off one person's bill. He had no customer service skills and couldn't care less about the quality of a customers dining experience. I am Indian and would say the food is average, nothing to justify the actual menu prices of the food. Quantity was on the small side. Luckily groupon gave me a credit for the $40 voucher. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway from here tonight and it was outstanding!! The butter chicken was sweet and spicy at the same time, the chicken tikka was tender and flavourful, and the naan was the best I've ever had in my entire life."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and I went to Yelp as my guide for some good to great food! I haven't had Indian food in about a year so when this place popped up I took a chance. When we arrived the place was empty (bad sign for anyone trying to eat good food)...however we still proceeded with dining here! The food was great! I had a big appetite so I had Chicken Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Piro Aloo, lentil soup, and of course Garlic Naan! Oh I forgot I also had Lamb Sekuwa...I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered today through Uber eats. First time eating Indian/Nepali food and dear God was it delicious!  Sauces that came with the order were amazing too. Everything was fresh and clearly prepared with great care. Looking forward to dining in and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Despite looking like a sushi restaurant from the outside, this place has great craft brews, really friendly staff, and excellent food (complimentary popcorn!). I hope they change up their outside appearance so they attract more customers, I also think the music needs to be more mellow. Overall, I recommend it and will be back to try their brunch this weekend"}
{"text":"Wowwwwww this food was so good!!!!! Nice environment and lovely staff! Blown away. My friends and I had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Great tasting & fresh. Super clean inside and really good service!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Himalayan/Nepalese foods!  Lucky for me Groupon had a voucher special for $12 for $30 worth of food for two people and that's how this journey began!

Although it is also and Indian restaurant, it is a great introduction to Himalayan/Nepalese .  A asked a fellow Yelp Elite to join me in this journey and she loved loved the experience as well.  I believe what made it really great were the staff and ofcourse the delicious foods.

We ordered: 
An exotic dish from the country of Himalayas, Khasi Ko Jhol (Goat stew on bone prepared in Nepali style), Chicken Momo (Typical Nepali style dumpling, steamed and served with tomato achar), Indian dish: Chicken Madras (Spicy chicken tempered with curry leaves, black pepper, and a touch of coconut cream), and an order famous Indian leavened bread with garlic and butter

The momos was something I always wanted to try, some people just think dumplings and yes it is but who does not like ???  I'll definitely be back!  The madras was nice, twinge of sweetness from the coconut.  The Ko Jhol was on the salty side but so good!  Lots of flavour!

If you have not tried Nepalese/Himalayan foods--do yourself a favour and GO!"}
{"text":"Ordered over an hour and a half ago and still no food. Have had to call the restaurant twice to ask when food will arrive. They have no idea. They are claiming that the driver is stuck in a traffic jam... at 9:45 pm on Sunday night. If the food does ever arrive, no matter how good it is (and I'm assuming it will be cold), will never order from here again."}
{"text":"This restuarant gets a \"0\" for service (or lack thereof) and I will not try again.

I called them to order delivery and although the gentleman on the phone came across as pleasant, he did not help me in any way.

Initially he said my food would arrive in 1 hour -fine.

1 hour later it did not come so I called the restaurant to inquire. He said it would arrive in about 15 more minutes or so - again fine.

Called the restaurant back at in 1 hour 15 minutes in and they said it will come, at this point I felt frustrated because it was not coming.

After 2 hours my food still had not arrived, no calls, nothing.

Will not order delivery from this place again. Their service sucks.

Good luck."}
