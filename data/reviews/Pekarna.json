{"text":"the quality of the coffee depends on the person who makes it..sometimes its amazing,other times i cant even go through my cup,they make the best redvelevet and strawberry cakes but every thing else i got wasn't good at all"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was first lured in this shop 8 years ago when I first moved to Montreal. Their cake display looked very attractive and I couldn't resist and not go in the store. I took a selection of deserts and went home to try them with my friend.. ALL DELICIOUS!! Since then I can say that I've tried pretty much everything they have on the menu! I was delighted to find out they make sandwiches too that I ended up loving even more than the sweets!  My alltime favorites are: their famous strawberry shortcake, the mango cheesecake, the mousse royale, the triple chocolate mousse and the red velvet cake. That 3 cheese delight sandwich they have along with the pasta mayo salad is simply to die for! Since then I started using their services for catering and the owners are very flexible with their menu and constantly adapt to our needs and come up with new suggestions... Real chefs!  Next time it's cold outside and they have chili soup... I suggest you try some, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I used to love the strawberry shortcakes and cheesecake there,they were both so amazing! But the last visit was a different story,the strawberry shortcake was dry and not fresh, the mango jello my friend ordered was fill with something weird ,not a good experience,my friend got refund after all with an attitude,er..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is so savory, flavorful and wonderful!!  I got an amazing iced mocha here!  I also got an unbelievably deelish sandwich.  They have beautiful looking desserts and gelato too.  There is one more pekarna location but this one is in with an AMC Theater if you are looking for a movie to go with your sandwich or dessert..."}
{"text":"Solid cake, pie and pastry selection. Decent italian style coffee. My favorite: euro soda and these little feta & ricotta puff pastry squares that are amazing!  Good for a post-dinner dessert and coffee in a sea of starbucks/tims in the area."}
{"text":"Pekarna kills me.  It had the potential to be amazing, but unfortunately, every single cake (except for the Strawberry Shortcake which is amazing) is horrible. And yes, I've tried them ALL. I keep having hope that I'll find something else that's good here, but it just keeps getting sadder and sadder.  The gelato isn't even good..Neither are the little pastries...  I've been here at least 20 times (work is nearby, and sometimes I pop in to buy a cake for an occasion or some pastries for breakfast), and unless I buy the strawberry shortcake, I always find myself really disappointed! *sad face*"}
{"text":"Awesome location.  Decent pastries but the humidity control seems a bit lacking in the display cases."}
{"text":"Place is ALWAYS crowded, service slow, almost impossible to get a table. Pastry average, but the only place around the Atwater metro area for this."}
{"text":"I used to love this place (the quality is very good but $2,00 for an inch wide cookie?) but today (and the previous time I visited as well) has me seeking other pastry shops for my cake fix. Bobby A. said service was kind of spotty - well today it was almost nonexistent. Another person and I both were waiting patiently at the pastry counter. A fellow behind the counter who had just finished serving someone else said that we had to go to the cash to get service. There is no sign to that effect anywhere - more on this later. The lines are not maintained (they ought to install a number system like almost all pastry shops have) and someone almost butted in ahead of us. While I am being served I suggest that a small sign might be a good idea. I get excuses and serious lip from the serving girl as to the fact that I should be the one to notice the lines at the cash and figure it out for myself. (WTF?) Pastries served and boxed it's back to the cash where I am told that I have to go to the other cash to swipe my card! The other cash was packed and I had to fight my way to the card reader. Then I get home to discover that she crammed 6 pastries into a box meant for 4 and one of the pastries was bone dry. So NOT going back."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and some great cakes and other pastries, but the service could be a bit better. I arrived mid-afternoon on a weekday, there were 5-6 customers and about a dozen empty tables, but every single empty table was littered with dirty dishes.   It's location is also less than desirable, it's right near the main entrance of the mall and doesn't have a wall/door separating it from the public areas of the mall."}
{"text":"I may have been full from a large dinner but how could I have passed up the strawberry cheese cake at Pekarna. This totally tantalizing cake and pastry cafe has all kinds of delicious sandwiches, desserts, platters, coffees, and teas. Their prices are reasonable especially for these great desserts. I completely recommend stopping in for a little bite."}
{"text":"The pastries in this place are amazing!! Don't know why it has such bad reviews. I thought their palmiers, croissants, cookies with jam and the Apple turnover were top notch. Would go back to this place just for that."}
{"text":"La pâtisserie, café où j'ai eu de si belle rencontres et de si bon avant film!    Endroit préféré de ma mère pour se gâter après son rendez-vous chez l'ophtalmologiste, elle aimait que je la retrouve là avec un bon strudel et un café.  Un des rares endroits à vous faire des affogato hors picola italia et leur café était à point!  Une étoile en moins pour un service souvent innégale entre les visites et certains gâteaux franchement trop sucré.   Mine de rien, mon deuil sera pénible.  12 ans de bonheur et un phare de l'ouest du centre-ville qui vient de partir."}
