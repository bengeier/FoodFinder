{"text":"The poutine is the saving grace. Wraps are passable but nothing special. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Great, clean place.  It's nestled in the back shops of Uptown. Choose your own ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Friendly owner made a delicious wrap of my daughter's choosing: chicken,  lettuce,  tomatoes,  olives, cucumbers,  and Tzatziki sauce. Pita was so fresh! Reasonably priced. Looking forward to going back with the entire family."}
{"text":"This place has been great every time I've dined. It's a yummy alternative to typical lunch foods found in the area, and pricing is really fair. My go-to when I need something serious to eat (and quick!) when Uptown."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place for lunch with some friends a few days ago.  I looked at the menu and was very excited to see the variety they had to offer.  I ordered a chicken wrap with vegetables.  The man who was taking my order was very incompetent. He kept yelling at his co-worker that the machine that heats the wraps wasn't working properly. He used several swear words and was very angry. He made my wrap after him and his co-worker figured out how to fix the problem. Now I understand that things break down on the job, but there is no reason for profanity in front of the customers.  The price of the wrap was very good., and so was the food itself. However. with so many other places to eat in the area where the employees don't use profanity in front of me available I won't be coming back here again. My advice to the owner would be to hire better workers who are more polite and maybe work along side them so they get the proper training and learn some manners. What a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Food is delicious for a good price, but the staff has the worst attitude I've ever seen. When asked to repeat his question, he intentionally read out the question very slowly, almost word by word, and I felt very disrespected. There were many actions that followed up being equally, if not more, annoying. I felt very embarrassed in front of my friend and would never go there again."}
{"text":"This place is a solid. Much better then the nearby Chipotle but with a different flavor. It's fast and the quality of the food is very good. It's not the best it have ever ate but it's tasty and all of the meat components are good. The spicy onions are my favorite part. The worst thing about this place is their nonstandard drink machine."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here it's been great. The service has been especially good- the people behind the counter make sure to clean off the tables regularly, and even when it's been crowded and there seemed to be nowhere to sit, someone (maybe the owner) managed to make a spot and produce chairs.   I've tasted the lamb gyro, chicken gyro, and poutine.  The poutine is satisfying, but the cheese curds don't squeak. It's so rare to find poutine where the cheese curds squeak though, I don't blame them! The lamb and chicken gyro were both good. You have to dress them well though. I relied on one of the counter people's suggestions but was happier with what my boyfriend had chosen for himself, so go with what you like for the toppings. I'm glad they opened up in University Circle, it's more affordable than its neighbor Panera, (which gets old so quickly... that's a particularly mediocre Panera) and more interesting than Chipotle. I will return!"}
{"text":"Wrapz was great.l! The staff was nice and very welcoming and the food was excellent! I had a gyro platter and it was really delicious stuff."}
{"text":"Poutine is off the chain, no matter what size you get! Basically this place is a Mediterranean subway when it comes to wraps. Courteous staff and a good place for a quick bite.  Wraps are a bit flimsy though."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The set-up for ordering and dining is similar to Qdoba, Subway, etc.  You order what you want, add toppings, pay, and grab a table.  We decided to try this place out because my husband used to live in Canada and was craving some legitimate Canadian poutine.  I had heard from one of my Canadian classmates that this was the place to go.  I got a chicken pita wrap, with regular hummus, some veggies, and garlic whip.  My husband, of course, ordered a big serving of poutine.  My wrap was amazing.  The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It tasted very similar to chicken shawarma, and the garlic whip condiment tasted exactly like Toum (garlic paste).  Delicious!  My husband said the poutine was by far the best he has had in the U.S.. However, he thought it needed more and bigger cheese curds, and the gravy was on the salty side.  But other than that he still really enjoyed it.  I tried the poutine and thought it was very good, but agree it was a bit salty.  The staff was very nice, and even came around to ask how everything tasted.  Will definitely be going back whenever I'm out that way."}
{"text":"Hidden in the middle of uptown University Circle, there is a new place called Wrapz that will wrap drunken students around their fingers at 2am at night.  Everyone I know always wants to snack after their night time adventures.  Well, now they have a chance to try a unique and enticing place at 230am after a night out on the town.  This place is great, I went for brunch and have stopped by for a late night snack.  My friends all rave about the poutine (fries, gravy and cheese curd), which I tried with out the cheese.  It was pretty good, I think the gravy could have had more flavor but it did hit my morning brunch craving.  I also got the beef wrap with spinach, cranberries (which I highly recommend), tomatoes, veggies, pickled radish, and a sesame tahini sauce. My boyfriend had the gyro and said the taste was just so so. Everything was pretty good with decent sized portions.  The taste was almost there, maybe i'll up it to five stars next time I try this place and it has more of a punch.  I think this is a great place, very clean with enthusiastic staff.  I would definitely suggest trying this place, especially after a late night.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Only complaint was the worker.  I've never been disrespected like this before.  All I asked was for fries when I was about to check out.  He gave me an annoyed/angry stare and said \"really?\". He continues to just look at me for a few more seconds. I just laugh it off at first because I thought he was kidding, but he obviously wasnt. He then mumbles something underneath his breath, rolls his eyes and tosses my credit card at me. The worker was there alone on 5/1/15 around 4pm. Hopefully the restaurant does something about him. I'll probably never go back."}
{"text":"This place is NOT open late! Came here on a Friday night walking around on my visit and it was not a late night food option :/"}
{"text":"When I went to CWRU for grad school this opened up. It is conveniently located right by the campus. It is something different for the area.   The food here is good. It's kind of like pita pit, but better ingredients. The garlic sauce is so good. The fries are also very good. The owner is usually there and he is very friendly.  Only con I have is the price is a little expensive for college students, but it is a nice treat."}
{"text":"This was my first time at paradise tavern.   We came to listen to band ,Jello Shots. The band was excellent, but food was also great. My husband ordered clam chowder and I ordered a burger. Both were excellent, in fact I've been having burgers at restaurants, trying to find a great one, and Paradise had it!! We were very happy with service and food, also their chips Are good. I would go there again."}
{"text":"To be honest my wrap was just ok. The real reason this place is amazing is the poutine! French fried topped with white cheddar cheese and gravy! I was a little hesitant at first because even though I love potatoes and cheese, I never had fries with gravy before. I almost skipped it if it wasn't for the awesome woman that worked there that encourage me to try it. I'm so thankful I listened to her. I got a small order and it was glorious!! 5 stars for great staff, clean dining, and great fries!"}
{"text":"This place has really tasty food and is a great deal. They give you a lot of food (much more meat than a typical sub, for comparison) for in a wrap for $6. I particularly enjoy their gyro meat. I tried their poutine for the first time today and was pleased."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since I pass it a lot during my commute to and from work.  When I first walked in, I was welcomed very warmly right away.  I also noticed how clean the restaurant was, which is always a plus.  I decided that I was going to get a gyro, but something else also caught my eye; poutine.  I had never heard of it.  The guys had told me that it was french fries with Cheddar cheese curds and brown gravy on it.  At first I didn't know what to think, but he convinced me to try it and so I did.  It was excellent, so was my gyro.  Not only that, the portion size was very decent.  I will be stopping back again and I highly recommend Wrapz Pita Bar."}
{"text":"Really solid new addition to uptown. Went there for the first time tonight. Had a wrap with chicken. It was great. They have nice sauces to add on. Next time I'll try the poutine! They're apparently open late too, which this area could use. They are tucked into the corner near where accent used to be. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the dining area clean. The food was good but not up to par with what's offered at other area Middle Eastern restaurants. Although covered with tahini sauce, the falafel was dry to the point of inducing minor gagging. It was no match for the falafel at Maha's Cafe in Ohio City. The fattoush salad was tasty, but other places, including Aladdin's and Nate's, do it much better. I wish this place well, but mediocre food and a location hidden from the street within the rather desolate (on this Saturday, at least) Uptown development may point to a troubled future. (Why bother making a trip to Uptown for a meal when you can find a Jimmy John's, a Panera or a Chipotle on practically every street corner throughout Greater Cleveland? And who wants to linger when pay parking in the Uptown lot is limited to two hours?)"}
{"text":"I've had their poutine, which was good but not near real Canadian poutine. It's really only good if it's either 1 AM or you're drunk. Leaves a heavy, disgusting feeling afterwards. However that can be expected. My issue with Wrapz is that they don't close at the time they say they do. On the weekends it says they close at 3 AM, however I have gone multiple times before 3 AM and they were either in the process of closing or already closed. Once we went at 1, which isn't even that close to 3. If you say you're closing at a certain time, then you should be consistent with that time. There's nothing more aggravating than making a late night trek in the harsh Cleveland weather and having to turn back without your late night poutine fix."}
