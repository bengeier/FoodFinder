{"text":"The food is great, the prices are great, BUT there's a serious ventilation issue.  I've been here twice and If you eat here prepare to launder / wash / dry clean everything you own because its going to smell like a deep fryer. And you wont be able to just air it out either, it's going to need a full wash.   Leave your suits and dresses at home people.  As always, when it comes to $1 oysters, expect many shell fragments =("}
{"text":"This review will focus specifically on Beast's \"happy hour\", Beast 120. Every Wednesday through Friday, between 5 and 7 pm, you can partake in one of the best deals going. There's a large menu of appetizers to choose from at $4 a piece, and a decent selection of VQA wines at $5 a glass.  When my friend Jen and I went to check it out, a couple of weeks ago and decided to make a tasting menu of it. By the end of the meal, hindsight proved this may have been overly ambitious. We were STUFFED.  Highlights for me included the house made bread and butter, the duck hearts, and radish salad (usually made with beets).  The pull-apart bread, by resident pastry chef Rachelle, is divine. Fluffy, warm, with a surprising amount of flavour, this can be enjoyed even without butter. I didn't expect to love the duck liver dish as much as I did, as I've not enjoyed farro in the past, but the richness of the organ meat matches very well with the rather bland grain.  I was also surprised by the radish salad, due to the element of pickled fennel. I like neither the licorice note of fennel, nor the overpowering vinegariness of most pickle brines. But this salad is a home run. As I mentioned, it's normally made with beets, which I'm also not fond of, but if you like it, I imagine the blood orange and pickle would go well with it.  The biggest disappointment for both Jen and I was the pig's head pasta. We had high hopes for this one, but it was very one-note, both to the eyes and on the palate. We agreed that all it would need to make this better would be the addition of a crunchy textural element. Perhaps finely diced red or yellow pepper, which would also add colour.  There were certainly enough items on the 120 menu to encourage me to revisit Beast for a regular dinner. I've also heard raves about the 120 lamb ribs, which, sadly, weren't on the menu when we ate there."}
{"text":"Two words. PORK HOCK.   I could write a 2-page review on the awesomeness of Beast. The after-work specials, amazing service and food that will make you weep tears of joy and embrace the chefs. I could write that review but really, you should just go and experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Only thing that I found I did not enjoy was the coffee. A bit too overpriced for its quality. Try the meat scrambled eggs! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Small portion sizes, the meat is not cooked well, very slow service, and the waiter reeked of alcohol. Their menu changes every week btw."}
{"text":"Literally just came here for brunch this morning and I just had to write this review now.  The food came out really slow and I am not sure why.  We literally waited for about 45 minutes for the food.  The server told us the kitchen can't handle fast enough when the restaurant is full.  I think the management really needs to step up the game and expand the kitchen.  Now onto the food, my sister ordered the veg scramble with salad.  The salad was really wilted down with the dressing and it didn't look fresh.  I ordered the beastwich and the chicken  has absolute no favour at all.  The potato tasted under cooked.  Would I come back again, probably not..."}
{"text":"Just left Beast New Year's Day and the 3 of us found it very hit and miss.  To start the coffee was $4 for a regular size mug of coffee, although the coffee was decent we found their way of serving coffee in a french press with a timer was an over the top attempt to be original.  Apparently serving a cup of coffee the traditional way is no longer trendy.  But the real annoying part is that they charge for refills?   2 of us had the Beastwich which was definitely delicious. I had the french toast with duck confit, cranberries and creme fraiche.  The duck was delicious and the French toast was also good.  I found the cranberries made this dish too sweet for me however no element on the dish was disappointing on its own.  The home fries were a different story. They had 100% been prepared much earlier then left in the oven on standby.  They were dehydrated, not hot, lacking in flavour and crispy texture.  I found a lot of things were done here to save on time for the staff and money for the establishment.  For example they don't split bills, the orange juice (freshly squeezed but by no means from great oranges) was a tiny portion filled to the brim with ice (literally 4 sips), the \"stand by\" home fries, zero coffee refills and they clearly don't want to pay to provide credit card service for their customers.  It's the little things right?!!!  To be fair they made decent brunch mains and the staff were friendly but they could go a few steps further to make you feel like they aren't so worried about their output especially when you've waited 45 minutes in the cold to eat there."}
{"text":"Two of us went here for dinner on a Friday night. We made a reservation for 6:30 pm. It was a nice night so we sat on the patio. It's a small, cozy place - the patio is in the front of the restaurant and probably seats less than 20 people. The plates are meant for sharing - I found that each plate was good for 2 people to share. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a happy hour between 5-7 pm with $5 drinks and plates.  What we ate: - curried chicken arancini (these were small, simple, and tasty) - crispy snails, quail eggs with greens (delicious) - horse short ribs (this was our least favourite as we found the meat to be stringy and a bit tough) - grilled prawns, foie & kaffir lime dressing (this was our absolute favourite - only 4 prawns and worth every penny) - poutine fried gnocci (hearty and delicious) - sticky toffee pudding (really sweet, rich, and yummy - 3 people could share this) - angel food cake, berries, mascarpone (simple and delicious - this dessert came first as we waited for the sticky toffee pudding, but I wish we ate this together with the toffee pudding to cut some of the sweetness)  Service was 5/5  We plan to come back during happy hour and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Adding Beast to my collection of great brunch spots! It was a super long wait and slow service (approx. 1.5 hours wait for table and food) but worth it in the end. I got a breakfast sandwich with grilled pork belly, fried egg, pickled onions, sweet & smokey mustard on an apple fritter bread. Definitely unique combination and very tasty! The only thing I would change is more sauce...but given they have their own homemade ketchup and hot sauces (which is another highlight btw our table must have consumed the whole bottle!), I didn't mind adding my own sauces. I will return earlier next time on a sunny day to sit at their lovely patio, avoid the line, and hopefully try some of their famous donuts (it was sold out by 1pm).  Love - Unique brunch combinations Hate - Long wait times"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite restaurant in the city so far. Incredible use of fresh ingredients. Servers are very knowledgable of the menu and attentive to guests needs. I wish I could pick a favourite dish but their menu changes so frequently which makes you want to keep coming back to try it all. One thing that consist on the menu is the buttery bread! They served it complimentary once but rest if the time we've had to order it. It's okay because I will pay any amount for that bread!! They have sizeable plates considering it's tapas/small plates. You will always leave satisfied and full !"}
{"text":"Amazing service... amazing crab cake eggs benedict. . Good biscuits... nice gravy... amazing press your own coffee... I got a side salad and even that was lime citrus. . Amazing... going back asap.. the beastwich is next on the agenda"}
{"text":"Unique dishes that are delicious. I've been for brunch and had several sandwich specials which were all exceptional. Most of all though, I go for the doughnuts which are the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"So I just realized I had not reviewed Beast.  I was thinking about what the best dining experience I had in all of 2013 and this was it, but for some reason I neglected to review it. There was a group of six of us eating and we paid for the chef to cook for us.  I think it was about $65 a head.  I don't remember specific dishes, but the tastes were fantastic and unique. I had to write this to give them the props they deserve, but I apologize for the lack of details."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Better brunches in Toronto with better service. Management attempts to price gouge you for reservations ( 9 people), and quotes you 5K to reserve the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"As a former server, and food lover, it takes a lot for a restaurant to impress me. Beast blew me away. I came with a friend for drinks and dinner. We arrived at 6:45 and were informed of the Beast 120 menu which is only applicable until 7. We wanted to take advantage of the $5 glasses of wine, and the server was kind enough to put in our order for 2 glasses each before 7, but kept the second glass at the bar until we were ready for it. Loved this touch, and we honestly ordered more and stayed longer because of it. The red wine was lovely - I don't remember the name, but it definitely did not taste like a $5 glass of wine. We started with the cheese plate and the scallop dish. I often find the cheese on cheese plates to be too strong for me, but this was not the case. Every single one was flavorful without being overpowering, even the blue cheese which I normally wouldn't touch! The scallops were large and perfectly cooked. We then ordered the gnocchi poutine with bbq boar and the striploin. The striploin melted in my mouth and the hoisin jus was phenomenal. The gnocchi poutine was my standout dish for the evening. Perfectly balanced, not too cheesy or meaty or saucy, soft gnocchi - drooling just thinking about it. The chocolate tart for dessert was average, although thinking back on it, it was probably just overpowered by the other AMAZING dishes. Service was impeccable throughout the evening; the candlelit patio was quiet and intimate. Beast is on a tree-lined residential street, so people were walking by with their dogs, families, etc. I got a really strong West Village vibe.  Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took a spur of the moment day trip to Toronto... with intentions of having brunch here after reading so many positive reviews. They don't take reservations but standing outside to wait in January was worth it. I had the huevos rancheros, and my only regret was that I was unable to finish it. The tastes were supreme, and I loved biting into real chunks of avocado (they don't skimp!). My husband had one of the breakfast sandwiches and polished his plate. A rarity with breakfast foods... especially eggs. We left happy and glowing."}
{"text":"Went for brunch recently.   I had a duck cassoulet made with duck gizzards and leg which came with an over easy duck egg. I was underwhelmed by this dish. It was... solid (good, not great). Just not that memorable to me (especially since I had a killer duck fish at Black Hoof the night before)  It probably didn't help that I was having a bout of burger envy for my friend who had ordered their burger. Beef cooked to medium, a slab (slices? who's ever heard of slicing it??) of peameal, with a fried egg, on an english muffin. It came with these delectable little tater tots that were amazing. Best tater tots. Ever.   I am so willing to go back just for their burger and those tots.  Another thing of note is that their coffee and tea list is just as long and twice as descriptive as their food (gotta love that Sam James made the picks). I had a very nice cup of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Every coffee is done in a french press and they come with those dollar store timers to let you know when it's done."}
{"text":"It is a small bar / restaurant.  Their food portion is very small and pricy.  People mainly go their for alcohol.   Their food is tasty but salty.  If you are looking for real meal, I highly recommend go somewhere else"}
{"text":"What a disappointment... I usually don't write reviews but I had to say something. We were very excited to try this restaurant we had heard some good reviews about. When we showed up, we were told we would have to wait 20 min for a table. There was one table available but we figured it was reserved for someone else. We ended up waiting outside 1h15min to finally be granted the same table which had been free all along!!!!  The coffee was weak, the food was bland... On the other hand, I found the concept of french toast with duck confit interesting. However, it was not enough to make up for this horrible experience. In the end they made a mistake with the bill and overcharged us 5$ but at this point we were just fed up and wanted to get out as fast as possible. Go at your own risks!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there afternoon my wife found it on the Internet. Small plates, the beet carpaccio, carrot tart, and the gnocchi poutine were creative and delicious. Service was excellent. Very high recommendation."}
{"text":"Beast is the type of brunch where you'll regret and enjoy at the same time. It's the type of brunch where you will leave super full and bloated. It's amazing. Love the French press coffee option and the duck French toast is a piece of indulgent heaven, comparable to the cheesy French toast at School. It's just a classic. This place has a nice, no-frills charm to it. Can't wait to go back and attempt one of their sandwiches next."}
{"text":"Loved it here - the pork was to die for but the octopus was disappointing, tough and grisly - biggest surprise was the leek and shiitake chips - delicious! Great service and knowledgable staff, already recommended Beast a number of times."}
{"text":"My husband and I drive up from Buffalo, NY on a regular basis to come enjoy this amazing place! We love the quaintness and charm. And of course the food! The menu is always amazing and we never leave without being completely stuffed!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place after watching it on the Food Network. I was excited to try it and had really high expectations. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and my partner order the beastwich.  The breakfast sandwich was meh and the potatoes were luke warm. I tried some of my partner's food and did enjoy the fried chicken and biscuit. If I do go back, I will most likely order the beastwich."}
{"text":"Well, this Saturday, my girlfriend and I planned a double-date dinner, because even though the boys are best friends, they would likely not see one another if it wasn't for our coordination. Knowing we had a 10 PM Second City show downtown made for a perfect excuse to get my Beast fix. Finally. Beast is hidden away on the corner of a neighbourhood street in a house that previously was home to restaurants like Amuse Bouche (Jason Innis) and Lotus (Susur Lee).  While the summer months tout a fair-sized patio, tonight, the cozy 35-40 seat room is the only option on offer (and rightfully so, at -5 F). On the walls hang unusual paintings of personified animals, assumably the \"Beasts\" representing the restaurants nose-to-tail approach.  It's quirky yet inviting, and makes me feel that I'm enjoying a casual meal at a close colleagues house.  The dining room itself is a mere few steps from the small bar and kitchen, the latter through which you practically walk through to find the ladies room at the back.  Understandably, with so little space and so many beast-digesting high -speed metabolisms going off, the room got a tiny bit hot.  This does not happen often to me, and for that reason, I can't even consider it much of a flaw since I would rather strip off one of my (many) layers, than shiver through a drafty dinner.  So just a little tip ladies, slap on an extra layer of ladies speed stick and see this as an excuse to show a little shoulder.  Now, thankfully, despite the tight quarters, the spacing allowed for adequate room between tables, and enough intimacy for our party. Speaking of intimacy, other than a brief roudy moment around the restaurant's climactic hour at 8 PM, and an eerily stint of silence around 9 PM, I was very pleased with the moderate noise level throughout the night. I could hear my server, and my friends, and didn't leave the restaurant sans voice. Miracle! Service was remarkably friendly, laid-back, and attentive.  The servers consistently replenished our table's communal water bottle, cleared our dishes in a timely pace, and ensured that the meal was spaced out appropriately.  I particularly appreciated the servers' enthusiasm each time a new plate came or left our table. I mean, it's not like I need a pep talk to get myself excited for STP but a positive attitude from restaurant staff always seems to enhance good flavours. Drinks at Beast include a good spread of local and international wines, artisanal beers and ciders, and about 6 house-made cocktails.  While most of our party stuck with beer (Beau's etc.), I went with the cocktail list which touted a good balance of classic stand-bys (ie. Caesar, Negroni, Manhattan), and unique recipes. Over the course of the night, we sampled their Caesar (standard recipe), French Martini (Grey Goose Vodka, Chambord Raspberry Liqeur, Pineapple Juice), and the Victorian Lady (Victoria Gin, St. Germain Edlerflower Liquer, Lemon Juice, Sparkling Wine).  The martini was very smooth with a good level of fruit and sweet, while the Lady had a really gorgeous floral note.  Being a sparkling wine bevvy, it wasn't the kind of thing I could order all night long, but certainly a great way to start.  The boys also got themselves into the Scotch and a little Sauternes, which turned out to be the perfect distraction so us girls could get a head start on dessert. The menu at Beast is broken into vegetables, fish and meat, all served as small plates with encouragement to share.  With nearly everything made in house, Beast aims to showcase the best of Ontario's ingredients with decadent and unapologetically hearty comfort food. While I was assured the menu changes seasonally, I was pleased (okay, so I was elated) to see that the menu item fueling my visit was still available (bring on that bowl of caramel).  Advised to select approximately 2-3 dishes were person, we ended up going with:  Parker House Rolls & Mini Baguette- Oh yum. I try not to fill up on bread in a restaurant, but when it looks as good as this, I have absolutely no shame.  The parker roll was buttery and fluffy, while the baguette had a gorgeous chewy crust.  Had there been more than one of each per person, we might not have made it to dessert (and what a massive shame that would have been!)    Fried Pickles & Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ($5)- While the pickle \"chip\" variety turned out to be easier to eat than the mini-pickle versions I always make, I missed getting that wicked burst of tangy pickle juice after I cracked through the batter shell.  Regardless, I still certainly found these pickles tasty, particularly since the ranch dressing stood in for the sour factor I was missing in the pickle itself.  Pickle Plate ($4) A really lovely selection of unique pickle flavours that included fennel, pumpkin, parsnip, celery and beet.  My personal favourite was..."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday evening for dinner, as a group of 4. We didn't have a reservation but was told that luckily there was a table available. Woohoo - what are the chances?!  Well, we were seated and waited round ten minutes before realizing no one had brought us menus, place settings or water. Finally, the host came back and told us that there was an error and the table we were at was actually for a reservation. He asked us if we wanted to sit outside. It was a fairly chilly evening and not what we had anticipated for out out of town guests. We were basically escorted out the restaurant and even then, there seemed to be no rush or intention to actually get us settled. The host's attitude did not seem sorry at all. We left and had an AMAZING meal at Lee, which is fairly close by.  I have heard amazing things about the food but hope our experience is better next time! A simple no at the beginning would have sufficed and a bit more empathy from the host would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and the food was delicious, although we had to wait almost an hour for our table.  We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the Poutine with fried gnocchi. The Huevos Rancheros was delicious and the tortillas were so crunchy when the dish first arrived. Everything in the dish just worked so well together. The Poutine was very good as well, an interesting take to replace the fries with delicious chewy gnocchi.  We want to come back again, but are a little hesitant given the wait time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this hidden gem because I was in the search for real-deal sausage gravy. I've ordered the beastwich every single time I visit. I find it really hard to venture out and order other things on the menu because the beastwich is just way too good. I'll keep coming back, their menu makes it difficult not to."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, mostly because my friends are in love with this place. Generally, I like it. But I don't love it as much as others do. The food is good, service is...it gets the job done. But after 5 meals here (3 brunches, 2 dinners) I don't think it's worthy of 5 stars. For brunch you will probably have to wait a very long time for a table (way longer than any other brunch place I've been to in Toronto) and while the food is good, I don't know that it's worth that wait. The doughnuts are amazing, and Beast 120 menu (5-7pm) is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago. The first thing that hits you when you walk in the door is very strong odour of burnt/old oil. The second I walked in I wanted to leave because it was that strong. They need better hoods/ventilation. Food wise this is tapas so expect small portions. The only good thing we had was the poutine, it was pretty good. However the price point of the food does not match the value. If you are going to come here, try to do patio to avoid the smell. Service was ok, but not the best"}
{"text":"Will not disappoint. Will surprise you. Will excited your tastebuds.   Whether it's for brunch or dinner, the menu is always fantastic.   Apart from their delicious cuisine, the restaurant is situated in a nice little house, tucked away on a cozy street. They have a nice little patio for the Sumer months too. Great date spot!   Must try."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, I got the poutine and the beastwich. Poutine gets 5/5, the sandwich 4/5. The poutine was flavorful with a little spice. The sandwich was good too but the biscuit was a little dry and I wish the chicken had a little more kick to it."}
{"text":"absolutely loved the brunch and donuts!  their take on brunch is very refreshing. servers were prompt and nice.  definitely need to find time to go back again.   be warned that weekends are busy, so go early and get in line!"}
{"text":"I came with a friend for brunch on Sunday. The patio was completely filled but there were empty tables inside where we were seated. I had the Bruce Leroy (fried chicken thigh with kimchi and egg in a buttermilk biscuit). The biscuit was a bit soggy and the sweet soy sauce was a bit overpowering, but otherwise a solid brunch. I also had the tea, which interestingly comes with a timer so you know exactly when to remove the teabag. They also have non-dairy milk available for those who are lactose-intolerant. When we left the place, there was a huge lineup outside, but that was just because they all wanted a patio table, so don't be intimated by the line if you don't mind sitting inside."}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH EVER!  Yes, we waited about an hour, but were smart about it and went to a nearby Irish pub to enjoy their $4 Caesar bar and pass the time.   Had the Brazilian roast coffee (which is served in a personal sized French press, complete with a timer for optimal brewing). Shared the fried gnocchi poutine (veal shank ragu that day) and then continued the gluttony with the beastwich. You better believe I ate every last bite of that deliciousness. And it was more than reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back and sample their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Beast was an awesome quaint little restaurant in Toronto. I went for brunch and was expecting a longer wait but a table for two took about five minutes. It was close quarters but that was expected. The service was fantastic as well. We wanted to start out with the maple bacon doughnuts but those were all sold out so we then ordered the poutine as an app. Unexpectedly the waitress brought us three little cupcakes to \"cure our sweet tooth.\" That was a great touch! So we got our poutine and it was incredible! The gravy was a venison gravy and was nice and rich and meaty. For our meals I got a pea meal bacon Benedict with house potatoes and my girlfriend got the crab cake Benedict with the house potatoes. Both of the Benedict's were phenomenal but the house potatoes fell short, they were very dry.  To get over the dryness I added some hot sauce but the stopper fell out and flooded my plate with hot sauce. But about a minute after that happened the waitress had come and replaced my meal with a fresh one and a new bottle of hot sauce. It made up for the dry potatoes! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, after receiving her OSAP thought it would be a sinfully irresponsible if she treated herself and me to a nice dinner to celebrate her semi-free money. I've just heard and read about Beast, it being another carnivore-centric resto in the city, and  decided it would be nice to spend this new cash on a meaty fest. I called to make a reservation and we happily set ourselves on our way to the restaurant.   Arriving on time, the place was humming. Its a small place with minimal decor, which aside from looking a little like a college bar, was charming. We stood at the entrance way taking it all in, and then nothing happened. We talked, and we stared at the two servers walking around. Not a single hello or i'll be with you. Nothing.  And finally one server, walked up to us with a dirty plate in hand and simply just looked at me as if asking with her eyes why i was standing there \"uh...we had a reservation for 2?\". With not even a word her eyes scanned the room and honed in at a table for two by the wall and pointed at it, like it was so obvious that it was our table. \"Thanks...\"  And then it started. Well not really it didn't start for a while actually. We waited for menus, and then water, again while staring at the two severs about. Finally without an apology menu were provided.  Having the money, and being hungry we quickly and simply decided on their $80 tasting menu with a bottle of wine. An amuse-bouche appeared, cornbread with cured meat and cornichon. We ate it, it tasted good. Then the waiting began again. it took another 30 min for the next course to arrive and then the rest and even then everything was all just OK. Sweetbreads, rabbit and lentils, beef tongue, dessert. We also had to ask what was put in front of us as well several times. It was all meager, even when eating fat with fat on fat and a sweet. Apparently \"Unleash the Beast\" is not really unleashing much at all. Left hungry and disappointed. Could've easily spent $160 on food and the $70 bottle of wine at the Black Hoof and been in a meat coma for 12 days."}
{"text":"Oh, the charcuterie plate--what an amazing assortment of yummy animals.  It was weird that the place was so empty; it felt kind of like we weren't supposed to be there, but by the end of Happy Hour there were plenty of people.  Get there at four to maximize your cheap-meat-eating time!  The staff were quick with taking orders and getting our drinks, but the portions weren't big so we were ordering more food until the last minute."}
{"text":"We went to Beast during their Ten Dollar Tuesday. The oysters were also $1 each which was great ( but they didn't have cocktail sauce) We ordered the bread that came with butter and a raspberry spread ($4). If feels so weird to pay for bread and butter at a restaurant.   For the entrees we picked the duck confit, beef tongue and the poutine. Everything was very good. Service was also great. We also tried the toffee dessert but it was too sweet for our taste.  We would go back again.  FYI, only street parking available."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday afternoon. Seated quickly and the server was very friendly and attentive. Great coffee and food but unfortunately they were sold out of their donuts (we came late in the afternoon so it was understandable). Highly recommend the beastwich!"}
{"text":"i've wanted to check out beast for a couple months, their initial reviews were decent and i was also interested in seeing the space where canadian culinary god susur lee opened his first restaurant lotus.  we arrived early, about 5:15 on a thursday night. beast hosts the \"beast 120\" from 5 to 7 wednesday to friday. Think of it as a trendy take on happy hour, they serve $4 beers (3 available right now, st. ambroise oatmeal stout, labatt 50 & flying monkeys pale ale), $5 glasses of wine, and $4 tasting plates.  after ordering a glass of pinot noir, we went straight into the tasting plates. started with a platter of three house-made charcuterie and rachel's bread & butter. the charcuterie available the day of our visit were: goat mortadella, elk & dehydrated blueberry terrine and duck liver with pistachio (i think). the platter came with pickled beets (my personal favourite), baby homemade gherkins, pickled olives and two types of mustard. all three were very tasty, the standout being the elk/blueberry. rachel's bread and butter was two types of mini-loaves, one was an egg bread (a bit dry) the other a multigrain mini baguette (delicious).  while finishing the platter, out came my order of lamb ribs. they were done in a traditional bbq way with a very good sauce and sided by cornbread and coleslaw. the ribs were much gamier than i anticipated, but were delicious. they had a nice crisp exterior, and a soft interior. the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  after ordering a second glass of wine our mains arrived, i went with the pig head's pasta whereas my dinner companion had the farmhouse burger. after taking one look at my pasta, she asked if we could share both items. pasta was pappardelle, long thick handmade noodles in a light meat sauce (no tomatoes here). it finished with an egg yolk, pea shoots and parmesan. the creaminess of the egg yolk & cheese counter balanced the acid in the sauce perfectly. it was the perfect dish, so much so that we ordered a second. the farmhouse burger was equally good, the meat was a good balance of chuck and fat, keeping the burger super moist and juicy. it was served medium rare on a hybrid biscuit/english muffin and topped with a flavoured mayo (i forgot to ask what it was but it tasted like it was spiked with truffle oil).  we rounded out dinner with two more plates, the fried green tomatoes and cauliflower pakoras. tomatoes were good, served with buttermilk ranch dressing but i felt like they were missing something. the pakoras were a good take on the indian staple but didn't wow us.  overall, a great meal at an even better price. beast 120 is a great way to sample the restaurant's menu, pick and choose your favourite items and then make plans for a return visit."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Was looking forward to it as it's a nice looking place and typically quite busy.  Our experience started with mediocre service. We came in and were told to wait outside. After waiting for a while, we were given a table....but before we got to it the waitress changed her mind as a group came in, which she thought would better suit the table. Not a smooth start...but we were still looking forward to a nice big breakfast.  When the food came we were not impressed. Small portions, pretentious food. Not what we expected from the vibe the place gives.  Won't come back for dinner unfortunately. Pretentious food and mediocre service isn't my thing."}
{"text":"Boar for brunch? Hells yes. Thank you Beast for changing my opinion on what type of meat is classified as suitable for brunch!  A gnocchi poutine topped with real curds and boar was the perfect appetizer, as were the dirty rice balls. Not sure what made them so dirty, but I guess I am no expert on dirty balls. :) Both were hefty portions and the two dishes were enough for me, along with my Labatt 50 and pickleback. Who knew pickle juice would calm the burn of whiskey?  I also tried the Beastwich and it was definitely beasty. Giant, open-face fried chicken on a biscuit, smothered in a sausage gravy and fried egg. Well worth the eating if you are hungry!   I would recommend coming early as a few of the brunch items were sold out by the time 1:30 rolled around. Certainly a sign that really good things just don't last :)"}
{"text":"I must say not very impressive first impression. To sum up the experience, 40-min wait to get seated , 40-min wait for the food arrival, 15-min to finish the food. I guess we waited so long and we devoured the meal like beasts!!! Weird part was the place wasn't packed when we were there for a Sunday brunch; but I don't think the kitchen could keep up with the orders. There were empty tables inside but they were just not taking ppl in. Beastwich was good but very heavy, made us wanna be on salad for the rest of the day; French toast with duck was just so so, very little duck for my taste.   With all being said, it is still a neat place to check out. Will I return again? Sure after I fully digested the beastwich and if the line isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Love the brunch! Favorite is the huevos rancheros. Gets busy, so would advise getting there early."}
{"text":"Great food and vibes. A positive atmosphere with great service. The Lamb Ribs are amazing and we chose a wonderful Clisson white wine to go with it. Prices are fair and our servant Anthony was very kind and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Had the \"beastwich\" at this restaurant. One of the most delicious and filling brunches ever! Staff is friendly and the ambience was great. It is however a very small spot (space wise) so expect to line up if you come after noon on a weekend especially during Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Found this little gem today and will definitely be coming back for the Beastwich. The breakfast potatoes were the best I've ever had. Coffee is French-pressed, delicious, but over-priced at $4 a pop. The vibe is relaxed and the decor is rustic and has a lot of character. Don't be in a rush if you plan on going though as you may be waiting a while to be seated and/or for your food to be prepared. It's all worth it though...your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats so this review is for the food only. As most reviews have pointed out, the portions are small. I only find this so disappointing because the picture on the Uber App showed a big full sandwich and a full size desert. Since it was only 10$ I didn't have super high hopes for quantity but I at least expected the sandwich bun to be full which it wasn't by a long shot. The leche cake also turned out to be only a wee morsel.That being said, the food tastes great! The meal came with a wee bean salad which I'm loving; the chorizo sandwich is very tasty as well although it is mostly bread. Overall I'd say this is about average for what 10$ can buy you in Toronto and based on the tasty food I'd be willing to try the restaurant."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with amazing service! Our server recommended several dishes based on our interests. We even ordered a couple dishes twice! Really delicious."}
{"text":"I came to Beast for breakfast whilst visiting Toronto and was not disappointed. To drink I tried their coffee. It comes in a French press and the server will give you a timer so you know when your coffee is done. To eat I had the chicken and biscuit and it was excellent. The atmosphere is fun and quirky and the staff were very friendly. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good quality food, but smaller then expected portions. I had to order an extra dish to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch and the donuts. Wow.   You have to get the donuts. I typically get there early so you can get your pick of the daily donut flavors. They typically have 3-5 flavors each day for you to choose from.   The breakfast sandwich is also pretty amazing. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed with anything on the menu. Although I've only been here for brunch I've heard the dinner is also great. Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Came on a Sat eve, with a group of 16 for a birthday.  Understandably the place is a little cramped with that size of a group, adding another birthday to the table beside of that equaled to another group of 10. The staff were quite polite and very helpful. The food was exceptional and quite eccentric. Great selections made from the chef. The portions could have been a little larger but the quality of the food was up to snuff.  The booze prices are a little high but for specialty cocktails they seemed pretty in line for what is to be expected in the area.  Definitely would go back with a smaller group, as the food was something to enjoy !"}
{"text":"Scott and Rachelle Vivian, a husband and wife duo, have taken over the quaint neighborhood space that was previously occupied by one of my prized secret gems - \"amuse bouche\", with a restaurant with a bold concept and a name to suit it- Beast.  With items like pig's head, duck feet, elk tenderloin, sweet breads and foie, this is definitely not a destination to take your vegetarian friends.  While the menu changes seasonally, it will always feature the main event - meat - (pork, beef, duck and elk, to name a few).  We opt for a few appetizers to start our dinner off - from the lamb ribs, salmon rillettes and foie gras of course.  Then we get the 'Beast' burger to share as we were sold that they came with home made tater tots! The beast burger came smiling at us with on an open faced English muffin literally with a lemon-mayo happy face which of course couldn't help but make you smile.  The burger cooked medium with peameal bacon, cheddar and a over easy egg! It was a burger mcMuffin! The mixture of it with the runny egg worked nicely however it was a huge bite."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic brunch. I ordered the beastwich and my friends ordered the maple chicken biscuit sandwich. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their meal. We also got an order of poutine with braised pork that was delicious as well. The wait was a little long but it was to be expected on a Sunday. They don't allow reservations so be sure to arrive early and have your whole party ready when it's time to be seated."}
{"text":"Great little place stashed away on Tecumseth between King and Queen. The Beastwich is by far my favourite, though the donuts are pretty special as well. Arrive around opening (10am) if you want to avoid waiting in lines. Their coffees are quite complex, served in a french press, and unfortunately FAR too weak for my liking. Very watery. I'd love to see them start serving drip or espresso instead."}
{"text":"Hipster twist on common breakfast foods. I had the Labatt 50 and it was good, but nothing special. I also had a chocolate doughnut covered in caramel and coconut, now that was the real winner! The waitress and staff were very nice and helpful with the menu. Prices were reasonable for what we ordered. I would definitely return for the doughnuts and to try another brunch item."}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros was a 4.5/5, probably the best I've had. Could have used more avocado, but really high quality and reasonable price. Great atmosphere, good tropical tunes, nice patio, and in a really calm, quiet part off the hecticness of King St."}
{"text":"The food was fine, definitely overpriced. Gnocchi poutine was the highlight, and probably the only thing that I would order again. The short ribs were literally entirely fat (even for short ribs) so we couldn't eat most of it.   Be warned: the place is small and apparently poorly ventilated, so you will leave and your coat will smell like fried stuff and you'll have to pay to get it dry cleaned.... so. There's that."}
{"text":"The food and service was terrible - I've never in my life experienced such poor service with disgusting food!!!! Such a shame since the chef is the owner supposedly! Do not recommend this place to anyone who is a foodie and enjoys good service."}
{"text":"We usually come to Beast on a Friday night, having made early reservations (6, 6:30). We've been here several times and we've always had a great meal. Pro-tip: $5 glasses of wine before 7PM, folks! A great start to the evening.  We've always had impeccable service that is neither too intrusive nor too aloof. Upon asking for clarification about the dishes that are gluten-free friendly, the chef usually marks down the items that are GF, that have soy (which is usually ok for us), or that can be made GF optional (like no bread on the side). The atmosphere is laid-back and intimate.  Favourite dishes shift with time as the menu changes every few weeks, but recent summer favourites included: - the crispy pig ears with chives: crispy, salty, flavourful; - ceviche on tostada: a great light dish with an almost creamy texture from the fish and avocado, balanced with the snap from the deep-fried corn tortilla; - bone marrow (!!!): this is almost always on the menu and is fan-tastico. We order it every time; - lamb ribs with feta: melt-in-your-mouth tender. If you like lamb do not miss this dish; - candied pork hocks with kimchi: this has peanuts in it so watch out if you're allergic, but otherwise this is another dish that we always order if it's on the menu. The flavour profile is sweet, spicy, and savoury. Awesome.  Since we've moved even closer to the area we look forward to coming more often! This is definitely one of our local favourites."}
{"text":"Went for a bro-brunch at Beast and I'll admit that I wasn't too happy with the outcome. (Pretty logo btw)  Keep in mind that this is just a review for brunch as I've heard great reviews on dinner and fully intend on going there again.  Décor:  Nice and homey.  It's a small space so at most, the biggest party you should go with is about 5-6 people.  There are 2 round tables to accommodate the larger groups and the rest of the tables are either for 2 or 4 (though I'm sure you could shove them all together). It wasn't busy when we arrived on a Sunday afternoon at 11am which was a surprise to me based on the hype that this restaurant was generating.  Food:  In general, I found that most of the brunch items as gourmet-ified items.  Sometimes, it's better to \"keep it simple stupid\" (KISS)  Gnocchi Poutine: This was probably the best dish we ordered.  The gnocchi was 'crisped' to be similar to fries but it also had the usual chewy tenderness that you would expect from the gnocchi itself.  Forgive me for forgetting the exact ingredients but there were some shredded wild boar, crème fraiche and some gourmet category items mixed in to give it that poutine feel but not overwhelm the senses.  I find that classic poutines tend to be a bit too much after a few bites and finishing it seems more like a chore than an experience.  Farmhouse Burger: This is where Beast no longer is \"winning\" for Brunch.  The meat was way too well done and the condiments weren't too spectacular.  I should have thought again before ordering it.  BLD:  This is a monstrosity.....because it's 20$! It's essentially an expensive triple-decker sandwich that uses more elaborate ingredients like Duck Confit, etc.  What it more horrendous was that they drenched it in a sauce (sorry I forget what it was but it was similar to gravy) which, though flavorful, made it impossible to actually hold the sandwich unless you wanted your hands and wrists to get messy.  To top it off, they used regular toast which compromised the structural integrity of the sandwich itself.  So I used a fork and knife and even with my precise modeling skills acquired through years of schooling, I was unable to cut proper pieces that would include each ingredient in a bite.  Taste-wise, it was ok but the sauce they used really masked any of the flavour from items in the sandwich.  Overall:  I probably should have ordered some different items and maybe my review would have been better.  That is always the problem when you try a restaurant once and then write a review.  I do still plan on going to Beast again for dinner and will update this review in the future.  I just didn't want to forget my experience here.  Food is always going to be subjective but this, as unfortunate as it is, was my brunch experience."}
{"text":"So the only reason i am leaving any stars at all is because the food is incredible and our server was a sweetheart. But to be honest I really dont think I'll be able to come back if I have to deal with that incredibly rude hostess!  Her job is not really THAT hard. I have been a hostess for some of Toronto's BUSIEST bars and restaurants. I accomplished seating all guests with a gracious attitude and smile on my face. The hostess here makes me feel guilty for approaching her, and gives me no hope that that there will ever be a table avaiable for me and my friends.   The worst part is, there was an empty table on the patio!!1 while there's a 45 minute wait??? I completely understand not being allowed to order because the kitchen is backed up (which the hostess just LOVES hearing herself say that over and over again) but seat a damn table so they can order some drinks and make the restaurant some money rather than have hundreds of people NOT drinking on the street.   I feel really bad for how much money these guys are missing out because of this horrible greeter who cant multitask or manaage a list of a mere 20 guests. Get it together."}
{"text":"A good long wait built up significant anticipation. Overall, a disappointment.  Service was just plain poor and inattentive. Its brunch for gawds sakes. Should I really need to send up a flare for more very expensive coffee? We waited for 45 minutes before the food came. Thats on top of waiting for a table.  The menu carries some very interesting food combinations. Points for creativity. The doughnut may have been the most delicious doughnut I have ever tasted. Tim Hortons doesn't stand a chance against this kind of baking. Ditto for the biscuits. Delicious.  The rest of the meal was just plain filler. BlogTO highlights their Huevos Rancheros as one of the best in the city.  This can only speak to sorry state of Huevos Rancheros as it is prepared in Toronto.  The chorizo was as bland as all get out and could have just as easily been sawdust. Potatoes were weather beaten. Nothing about this signature dish was worthy of praise. Just there. Even the hot sauce offered on the side was asleep. The 7 or 8 lettuce leaves on the plate were dressed with some sort of lemony oil concoction that was the strongest flavour on the plate.  The veggie egg dish was with snow peas which is just a plain bad idea. Like kissing your sister on the elbow.   the dinning room smelled like old fryer oil. Perhaps the kitchen could change it once in a while or improve the ventilation system?"}
{"text":"From Vancouver. We were thrilled to discover this little place tucked away on a quiet street. Had brunch on a Saturday and waited in line. It was well worth it! Beastwich and French Toast were amazing. The service was very good despite the crowd in a small place. Will definitely return on our next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! We went there for our anniversary and it was one of the best local restaurants I have ever been. Every dish we ordered was amazing, specially beef cheek dish!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because it lacks consistency. Some of the food deserved a 4 or 5 star rating, but other components brought it down.   We went for brunch and were SHOCKED that the coffee (french press at your table) was $4. For a french pressed coffee that is VERY expensive. And it only yields 1 cup. It turned out watery and disappointing. The bean selection had such promise but the coffee looked clear, like water with mud and all three of us agreed it was disappointing. Plus, no free refills with brunch is a no go.  The service was fine, the brunch was good but not the best we've ever had. Worst of all my bill came to $26 (for 1). I ended up leaving full but disappointed about what I got for the money.   Also, it's very cold inside because it's a small place and the door opens so frequently. On the plus side, the bathrooms are on the main floor and clean and cute."}
{"text":"Expected a lot. A little disappointed. Staff was nice, portions small and menu selection limited. $80 for a dinner for two (2 drinks, cheese plate and 2 small mains). Meh in flavour. Bought a hotdog poutine combo at the movies afterwards."}
{"text":"My girlfriend surprised me and took me here for brunch today. We got there at 10:10 (brunch starts at 10) and it was busy but we got seated right away. Atmosphere is cozy, very home like. Service was friendly and quick.   The food was delicious. We started with a curry boar poutine (the special of the day) and it was unique. Not your typical poutine with fries but made with gnocchi instead.   For our mains, I got the Beastwich and my girlfriend got the crab cake Benedict. both come with either potatoes or a salad as sides and we both got potatoes. Serving size was just right. definitely would recommend the Beastwich sandwich to anyone that asks"}
{"text":"I can only comment on brunch at Beast.  But considering I've had brunch here over a dozen times, it's just divine.   Split the gnocchi poutine with a friend (too much for one person - especially if you're ordering a main).  The fried, pillowy gnocchi is heavenly.  Try the crispy pork hocks, or any their featured meat scramble.  And their coffee is top-notch french press that comes with a timer for that perfect cup.  Be prepared to wait if you don't show up as soon as they open.  Service is always great."}
{"text":"Only been here for brunch, but have had great meals every time. The wait can be a bit long (40 min) but the food is worth the wait. Warning... Can be a heavy brunch."}
{"text":"First off, I love Chef Scott Vivian and his gorgeously casual approach to food. Secondly, I love that he and his wife have created such a warm, friendly food location.   Beast Restaurant has a wonderfully varied menu that nicely balances meat, fish, and veg. It also has a fantastic wine & beer menu that is chalk-full of local favorites. I was happy to be introduced to Beau's brews that night! My duck confit was a treat; crispy, flavourful meat cooked just right and carefully laid over pillow-soft ribbons of freshly-made tagliatelle. And the accompanying veg (an extra charge, but worth it) were lovely too -a meal in and of itself, with peas, prosciutto, and asparagus in one loving package. My mate's burger looked wonderful, and, judging from the number of people ordering the same, I'd say Beast's burgers are popular indeed!  Service was excellent, thorough, friendly, and fast. And I love the cozy interior and arty decor. One thing: I'll definitely have to save my pennies for a return visit -Beast is pricey for my budget -but for a treat, it's definitely a go-to spot."}
{"text":"Finally made it to beast , heres a quick review in point form:  -Menu was simple , with lots of offerings.   -most dishes were tasty, some were remarkably under seasoned or bland. a strong example is the gnocchi poutine, the gnocchi itself has literally no flavour at all. The steak was again not very flavourful and clearly carried by the sauce on the plate.   -the thing that bothered us the most were how ridiculously small the portions were. I understand they are small sharing plates, but as a party of 2 we ordered 10 dishes. the waitress was even very concerned about the amount and said \"you are getting ahead of yourselves\" and that she would be very impressed if we ate all that. honestly after clearing all 10 dishes and then ordering desert and coffee i could safely say i could have eaten our entire course by myself had we re ordered it ... most dishes are compromised of a few bites which brings me to the next point.  -Price is a bit much for some things, i dunno i guess im blessed to be well versed in the kitchen and thus understand value a bit more.   -Service was great , our waitresses were charming , and the atmosphere of the place is nice casual and cozy.   - Killer sparkling apple cider btw..    Really smart business model though i must admit, the nose to tail concept is very economical :) , just wish we could have left fuller after nearly a 200$ bill for 2 people and no booze included!  not for the really hungry diner imo.. its like one of those places you go to , to socialize over a drink and share plates i feel.."}
{"text":"Innovative, tasty comfort food.  The only real flaw is that, like many places in Toronto, they recommended way too much food - 4-5 plates between two people when 3 was already more than enough."}
{"text":"Had brunch here and their beast burger was top notch. It's definitely worth trying given brunch fare is usually pretty standard. Would recommend making the trek out for this spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, definitely one of the top restaurants Ive been to thus far in toronto.  Every dish on the menu was exellent, favorite had to be the pork.  While not cheap, usually for this quality I would have to pay considerably more.  In fact quite often Ive paid much more for dishes that werent nearly as good.  Only neg I can remember was the cocktails were just average.  Happy hour is also a great value with $5 apps and drinks. Im def coming back."}
{"text":"Staff is rude and unfriendly, like really rude. I won't even get into details, but they're the worst. Food wasn't as good as I keep hearing, nothing special really. Definitely won't go back and waste my money/time here, when there are obvious other amazing places in this city to eat."}
{"text":"I'm also super-late with this review (which should have been written the second week of June, but here goes) ...  So ... 6 days after my friend's birthday brunch, we decided to end her birthday week with - what else? - another brunch.   This was my first time at Beast. I've always considered myself proficient at brunch.  Apparently I've been doing it wrong.  I was a late arrival to our small group (which included my friend Fern H.), but I was right on time for some meal-time decadence!  I think I may have sampled a piece of the maple bacon donut Fern mentions in her post, but I can't quite remember.   For my main, I ordered the French toast (the bread they used was challah - holla!) with duck confit, topped with cranberry mostarda and whipped creme fraiche, with a side of maple syrup ($13).   Sweet. Fancy. Moses.   A lesser version of me would have rubbed that stuff all over my face, it was THAT good. I also ordered a mimosa to wash it down, just to keep it classy.  The establishment isn't huge, but given Beast's decadent menu, I liked the cozy feel to it. Service was decent, too.   I would recommend it to anyone - resident or visitor - and I hope I get a chance to return here, whether for another brunch or a different meal entirely."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend. Line up was supppppppper long. You have to put your name down then wait outside in the cold until they call your name! If you're not there when they call you then the table is given away! Good thing it's close to the Main Street so you can walk around and get a coffee while waiting.   Ambiance: small and cozy!  Food: Great but nothing too memorable. They have good twists.  Overall: Cozy place I'd go once to check it out :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service but if you like to have a split bill at the end of your meal don't even think about it because they refuse to do it and were kind of rude about it."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. It was about a 30min wait at 11am.  The food was average. The chicken pollo loco felt very heavy and didn't have a lot of complex flavours. The brown butter glazed and cinnamon doughnut were good, but no one at our table liked the raspberry hazelnut one.  While the servers were, on the whole, quite friendly, there were issues with coordination and organization. Even though people were waiting to get a table, two tables outside sat empty because they were in full sun. Also, it took several minutes for tables to turn over once customers left. The couple ahead of us had to ask if they could sit down at a table that had been empty and cleared for over 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times. Its Small, intimate, cozy with arty decor. Service was friendly and helpful. menu is too limited due to \"local and seasonal\" theme. Pangea does the same thing but are open to other items in order to keep menus balanced and interesting. What I recommend: duck hearts on toast mushroom ragout crises and hazelnut, tongue and scallops celery root sauerkraut pomegranate, braised rabbit lentil curry brinjal pickle raita, lamb ribs Carolina BBQ sauce coleslaw, duck confit romesco salsa verde fingerling potato, chocolate brownie and lime &lemongrass sorbet. I would definitely go back. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Beast is great. On Friday nights before 7 pm, you can get $5 glasses of whatever wine they have.  Their menu changes week to week, so even if you go often, they're always cooking up something new. Extra points for the tapa style menu, because pretty much everyone wants to try more, rather than scoffing down the same thing for an entire meal. It's less hip than Parts and Labour, and more intimate than Black Hoof.  Portion sizes are more manageable, but prices match, so you feel just as full after ordering more dishes."}
{"text":"If you're planning to go here, make sure you're not hungry when you arrive.  I've only ever left very positive reviews but this experience left my companion and I pretty dissatisfied, I wish we had eaten elsewhere and saved 2 hours of our time.  Came here for brunch - waited 40 minutes for a table even though we were told it would be a very short wait, the entire time we could see empty tables inside....?  Ordered as soon as we could, waited yet another 40 minutes for food to arrive. The table beside us even struck up conversation about how long everything was taking. There were a handful of staff but it was impossible to get anyone's attention for the first while. After almost an hour and a half of first arriving, our food arrived!   The food: a little cold and not super appetizing. Beast is trying too hard to be hip and interesting with its menu and not spending enough time on flavour or quality. Pork belly was chewy and overcooked. Fried Chicken soggy in sauce. Overall, mediocre with a side of insanely slow service. There are some great cafes and other brunch places around the area that I would much rather go to in the future.  Food - a little heavy on the grease and very heavy on the salt Service - slow - 40 min wait for a table, 40 min wait for food   Would we come again? No."}
{"text":"Fabulous servers, fabulous food, and a great atmosphere.  It would be great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!!  The menu is simple making it relatively easy to decide on what to order, and the quality of food is exquisitely unique, delicious and fresh.  The restaurant is family run and one of the owners (the chef) is friendly and can be found in the kitchen!!  Its a passionate operation.  :) :)"}
{"text":"I would never have guessed that \"Beast\" was a place to get brunch, not to mention amazing brunch!   They have your basic breakfast items, but accessorizes them with things like duck confit. I tried the Beastwich and I'd never ate anything like it! Buttermilk biscuit with fried chicken thighs, pimento cheese, covered in pork sausage gravy. Did I mention there's a fried egg tucked in between the chicken and buttermilk biscuit?   The maple bacon donuts were not as amazing as I thought, but donuts are always good in my books!   The coffee selection such as the Brazil + Indonesian mix consisted of cashew, peanut brittle, sweet pepper and sponge toffee. Delicious!   I definitely want to come back and try their dinner menu. The menu here is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas restaurant with a menu that changes weekly. The mussels and mackerel were my faves. Will definitely be going back to try the brunch and donuts!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I love the pork hocks. I keep going back every few weeks because they're constantly changing the menu. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on cold sunday at noon for brunch. I was told the wait time was about 15 minutes. They told me that I could wait outside and they'd call me when a table was ready.  Well that 15 minute or so was quite cold to be waiting outside in winter. The restaurant is really small and tables are crammed in. Weekend brunch gets really busy so maybe I'll try and make it in earlier next time. I was disappointed that the maple bacon donut was out but that was my fault for going late.  I got seated at a table and was served right away. I got the Brazil and Indonesian mix coffee, which they set a timer for 3 minutes until it's ready to be served. I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict which was delicious with potatoes and a side salad. Everything came in a timely manner although I was disappointed at my sad looking side salad. All it had was mixed greens and pickled onions that I do not wish to pay $6 for... If I knew what a rip off it was I wouldn't have ordered it. I would like to come back and try more dishes because I really did enjoy the tasty coffee and crab cake benedict but I took 1 star off for the sad side salad and the wait out in the cold."}
{"text":"Adding to the growing list of TO's tapas joints, be prepared to order about 3 plates per person at roughly $15 per plate to feel comfortably satiated.  Went here for a group dinner with friends and ordered almost everything on the menu, which seems to change from time to time or variances on their online menu - which could be a good thing, as the standout of the night for me were the grilled prawns with preserved lemons, I swear I could eat those til I turn pinker than a flamingo, but hey, I'm in front of *company*.   The rest of the night? S'ok. The pickerel escebeche was sprinkled with cured lamb heart powder, which I couldn't taste. Whelks were good, but the hakka sauce was meh. Friends loved the fried gnocchi \"poutine\" but I found it a bit dry. Pork hocks were another hit, but again I personally found the actual meat part a bit dry.  My honest opinion is that Beast tries to be like another head-to-tail type of eating with an Asian fusion twist, but somehow it misses the mark for me. If I want to get tapas, I'd go to another popular tapas joint with higher pricer tags but matchingly high quality. If I'm in the mood for offals, I'd go for that other head-to-tail place. Sad to say, with a name like \"Beast\" the food was more of a soft \"mew\" than the roaring flavour I'd expected.  Mew."}
{"text":"This place was EXCELLENT! you get your monies worth when it comes to taste and the portion. This place was second on our list we originally went to another place for brunch but they weren't taking anymore people for brunch so we caught the bus down the street to this place and it was a sign.   There was a little wait the hostess told us about 20 to 30 mins so we sat outside and took photos and what felt like 5 mins later our name was called for a seat. The drinks were great the food was great the people working were SOOO pleasant I would DEFINITELY go back. Also get the dessert (Sticky toffee pudding) we were back and forth on getting it but after tasting it we were happy we got it. It's hard to describe because there is so many favors that work and werent over powering the other, you will just have to taste it to understand"}
{"text":"After seeing so many good reviews of this place, including that from Bourdain, we decided to try this restaurant last weekend!  And to our dismay, it did not meet our expectations.  It is tapas style here where you order a couple dishes to share.  We had the duck confit dish, a raw tuna salad and some other app that I can't even remember because it was that unmemorable.  Portions were small, food was not good and each dish was expensive (12-20$ each!).  Service and decor was ok, but it did not make up for the below average food.  Needless to say, we left with a pretty big dent in our wallets but still hungry and had to fill our tummies elsewhere.  I will not be coming here again, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.  Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friends birthday.  We were served at least eight different dishes. With the first two servings there was a general sense at the table that this may be one of those places that we leave feeling hungry.  We were pleasantly surprised.  With subsequent orders the proportion sizes exponentially grew.  I really liked the gnocchi poutine and the fish--I think it was the Ontario smelt. Each dish was unique and prepared with care. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience was not on par with many other reviews.  The service was extremely slow and the food was average at best.  The donuts were the only redeeming part of the meal, and those were mostly gone within an hour of opening.  3 stars is generous."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about non-franchize restaurants is the creativity put in new dishes. Beast has outdone themselves  with a unique brunch and dinner menu. I wish we had the stomach to try everything !  For starter we ordered the gnocchi poutine  with chicken and peas. The gravy sauce was Devine.  I got the Polo Loco.  Which was pretty mind blowing. The avocado and the sauce was just amazing   my friend went for the Bruce leroy. Which was  very much Korean with the egg and Choi.   Would definitely recommend coming here !!"}
{"text":"Wrote a review 2 years ago and Id like to update it. Same 5 stars and its gotten better. Want a patio spot for brunch? Get there before they open.   Chef Scott, Rachelle and now Sous Chef Colin are all brilliant as ever and their Friday Beastwich lunches are a hit.   Love the intimacy, delicious food that I could never do at home and cozy feeling I get there.   Local everything is always a plus and cheers to the crew for going out of their way for this.   Always a treat."}
{"text":"I waited for over 1 hour after I ordered food. The wait time is just not worth it. Food is a little too salty. This brunch is overhyped."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night dinner, service on the phone was great and making reservations was very easy. Unfortunately the food was just mediocre to me, after reading great reviews I expected much more! The gnocchi poutine and venison was delicious but I would definitely not order the lamb ribs or squid. I will probably not be back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the single worst service I've ever encountered. We saw a server send an elderly couple to wait in the cold for a half hour, despite their effort to stand just inside the door, out of the way to keep warm. I'll never be back. All around bad vibes."}
{"text":"Beast was a last minute Friday reservation. We were a group of two, which unfortunately meant that we couldn't dig as deeply into the menu as I'd have liked. What we did have was fantastic. I'm still thinking about the escargots and sunchokes, the gnocchi was super satisfying, the trout with beet and quail eggs so fresh and yummy. The pork hocks were good, but it was the item I'd ditch of the four we ordered.   The wine pairing, a Spanish blend, was suggested by our waitress. It was interesting enough that we both paused and thought about the taste, really enjoyed it, and also found it a spot on pairing for a fish/meat selection of dishes.   The bread, baked in house, is worth a visit alone. Perfect. And the waitress happily brought us seconds. Nice.   The space is a little cramped/cozy, and the blast of cold air as people headed in/out on one of the coldest days of the year (decade?) wasn't ideal, but I'll be heading back to Beast, winter or summer."}
{"text":"Dinner (Overall Rating): 3.5/5  Breakdown-   Service: 4/5   Food: 3.5 - 3.75 We did the 45$ tasting menu as we were a group of 8. The chef customized the menu based on dietary restrictions that some had. We tasted a good number of the dishes from asparagus to beef heart & ribs. All tapas style (for 8). Everything was tasty, but none of the dishes gave us an OMG moment ;)  Value: 3.5 - 3.75  Ambience: 3.5 - 4 Cute cozy place had this very neighbourhood feel.   Repeat: Not in a hurry. Would I recommend others try it? Yes."}
{"text":"Frikkin finally got to try this place after bookmarking it for so long! Also attempted to come last Monday but they were closed!!! (Hence my close on mondays and tuesday tip).  I ordered the beastwich sandwich for lunch and it did not disappoint. It had the perfect amount of flavour in each bite and who can go wrong with deep fried anything?!   My only qualm is that the spicy sauce they offer as a condiment was not spicy at all! They need to take lessons from the hot sauce offered at rasta pasta. Then it would take it straight to BEASTMODE.  Great experience overall. Keep it up.   P.s. service was excellent."}
{"text":"Visited here for brunch,waited about a hour to get a table. Once we got our food, it made up for the long wait time.  I got the usual eggs benny  with added avocado and it was delish!  We shared the fried pig ears , which were quite different to try.  My favorite was the gnocchi duck poutine , I have never had anything like that, super delicious"}
{"text":"This place is raved about as one of the top 10 brunch places in Toronto. They are supposed to be known for their biscuit sandwiches.  From a wait time perspective, I suggest going early as this restaurant is small and it does not have a lot of tables.  Service is good. However, in regards to all the hype with their biscuit sandwiches, I was not impressed with their Beastwich. The gravy was just ok and nothing with their fried chicken stood out to me."}
{"text":"Came here when my mother was visiting from out of town. We tried around 6/7 different dishes each one as good as the next. We arrived on Wednesday so half price wine was a nice surprise. I'd recommend the pork hocks, fried gnocchi \"poutine\" and the duck ham w/ foie gras.   Thanks folks for giving my mother a memorable birthday!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the vibe of this place. Cute, small, twinkly, intimate. Great date spot. I was here for exactly that - a date. Must orders: bone marrow brulee, crispy pig ears. OH...MY...GOD. I'd like to come back for brunch! I hear it's awesome here. Any suggestions on what I should order when I make that happen? :)"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome 80's music and the staff was authentic and attentive. The pork hocks, duck breast and tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed. I thought the long lines and websites singing their praises would mean it was a secret foodie gen disguised in a hipster townhouse but I just left slightly sad (2 hours later).  First off it is TINY. It is literally the size of an apartment living room because it is ? The hostess/server estimated a 30 min wait but it actually took 55 before we were seated.   Service took forever after already waiting close to an hour outside. Took forever to order, get our food, bills, server never checked in. Food was okay, but I think they are trying too hard with some elements and can simplify. Venison poutine was super gamey, flavors didn't marry well. Donuts were cakey but in a flavorless way.   I don't recommend, there are far better options with far less wait time."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Saturday expecting to wait for a long time to be seated but got a table within 5 minutes. Ordered an earl grey tea and the huevos rancheros (super yummy and flavourful). The mister got a coffee (he loved it) and the breakfast sandwich which he really enjoyed. They have homemade sauce as well which I really like. Great atmosphere. Cozy little place. Would definitely come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Finally I get to yelping about this place.   Having lived in the area for a year it was only two months ago a group of friends and I went for food here. Firstly I have never been a fan of brunch, its the most pointless word and name for breakfast ever. Plus brunch is never that nice that it even deserves to be called anything but breakfast.  This place however needs a new name because their food is soooo good. My first experience was of their special beastwich, with a side of home made onion rings. Just happen to be the best onion rings I  have ever tasted.   The second time I went I tried their french toast with duck bits, again amazeballs! This is probably one of my favourite dishes here and I have been known to order it to go just so I know its there at home waiting for me after a long day.  They have a sweet patio outside and inside is kind of rustic but nice also. The staff are top notch and have never given me reason to fault them.  Definitely my favourite and number one choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"came here for a Sunday brunch with my cousins.  put our name down on the list and literally waited over an hour to be seated.  it had a nice homely feeling but because we were seated near the door, with it opening and closing constantly I was really cold. Because of how busy it was there was no room to be relocated anywhere else.  the place is very hipster - it's probably the size of my living room and dining room combined - it's small.   would I say it was worth the wait - no. it was cold outside and there was no where else to wait (street parking was hard to find so we had to park down king.)   I had my go-to which is always eggs benny - it was okay - I've been having it a lot lately that it didn't hit the \"spot\" especially for how long we had waited. I really wanted to try the bacon doughnut but they were sold out. my cousins enjoyed their meal. one got the French toast without the duck and the other got a Mexican breakfast dish.   the serving was a little too much for me but that's also because we waited so long to eat that my appetite was gone.   we also had the mimosas which were really strong!  overall a 3/5 because the ambiance and service was good, I wasn't sold on my meal."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a late Sunday morning. Gorgeous patio away from the hustle of King Street, with not a lot of tables, so it's quite quiet and intimate. The service was great, although the food was very slow as we arrived just after a major rush and the kitchen needed time to catch up. Our server explained that clearly though, and we were happy to slowly enjoy our coffees while we waited. We both has huevos rancheros, which was really good. Would love to go back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"We visited Beast for brunch, arriving right as they opened their doors.   Check this place out on Google street view (or equivalent) before you come or you could easily drive by it - it's a house in a residential neighbourhood that's been converted into a restaurant. They do not take reservtions, so get there early or you might be stuck standing outside waiting for a table. (And this past weekend that would have been a chilly situation.) Coming here with a group of more than four or five people might be tricky.  A very friendly server quickly sat us (giving us advice on which seats were warmest, which I appreciated as someone who's always cold) and brought us food and coffee menus.  Coffee at Beast is served very fresh - as in they bring a French press and timer to the table for you and you press it yourself - and the beans are nice, though not out of this world. We ordered our choice of coffees along with some doughnut appetizers - bacon maple doughnuts and apple fritters with brown butter glaze. Both doughtnuts were delicious.  The menu was very interesting looking, especially at this price point. If you're looking to have a nice brunch or dinner for less than you can (easily) drop in Toronto and have it served to you by hipsters (I say it with love... at least for these hipsters) this place is a great choice.  For brunch he had the beef short ribs and I had the breakfast tostadas. Both were tasty, but the flavours just didn't *quite* all go together. In my case there were some sort of inexplicable sweet potatoes (regular potatoes would have gone better... but more beans would have been even better!) and in his case he had a plate of individually delicious dishes that didn't mix well - that's a problem for us, we're food-mixers. It wasn't that anything wasn't good - it was all good - but it was just a tiny bit off in the flavour combinations. I feel like they might have gotten a little carried away with making things fancy (for instance, sweet potatoes are \"nicer\" than regular potatoes or no potatoes) and that's what resulted in this and is the only reason I can't bump Beast up to four stars.  That aside, we did enjoy ourselves. It's a cool little spot. You can book a \"whole animal dinner\" for a group where Beast will butcher and cook a whole animal for you, which would be really fun and is something we might try."}
{"text":"Apparently, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, making a weekend dinner reservation in the city last minute is silly. & apparentlyyy, trying to make a reservation for a group of 10 during this time is laughable - oops! But procrastinators of Toronto, it appears all hope is not lost. In trying to secure a rezzo for a Friday evening just a few days prior to, Beast was not only able to accommodate such a large group (and provide an extra spot at the last minute), but times were flexible too. I think Beast's tucked away location perhaps makes it lesser thought of but the dining room definitely filled up the night of. Servers were super friendly and didn't get frustrated at our indecisiveness, and they easily accommodated food allergies. But - annoyingly/understandably/forewarned, they don't do separate bills.  Once seated, our server advised that dishes are small and you'd need 2-3 to fill you up. So for groups larger than 6, they suggest the family style tasting menu (~$40/pp) of 12 or so courses of whatever the chef's heart desired that night. And man, Scott Vivian - your heart knows tasty food.   There were dishes on/off the menu, including:  - FRIED PICKLES - thinly sliced & served with a buttermilk dip; like hot salt & vinegar chips!  - MUSSELS - escabeche-style: chilled and vinegary; not bad, but nothing special - GNOCCHI POUTINE WITH TURTLE RAGU - crispy pillowy gnocchi as fries + cheese curds + turtle ragu as the gravy. every single person at the table thought we heard wrong but we ate turtle! yum - just like beef. - SMOKED TROUT WITH BEETS & QUAIL EGG - topped off w/ dollops of greek yogurt and a sprinkling of sunflower seeds; immensely satisfying on all levels of smell, taste, & texture - VENISON STRIPLOIN - so damn tender and not a hint of gaminess.  - SQUID W/ POMELO & VINAGRETTE - squid was cooked well but seasoned a bit too intensely with the vinaigrette; left my palate still burning as i dug into the next dish  - FRIED PORK CUBES - by now the meat was getting to my head a little, so i thiiiink it came with kimchi & peanuts (and a special plate for the individual with the peanut allergy). the perfectly cubed pork reminded me of Chinese roasted pork belly: crispy & fatty. - STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING - this was the show stopper grand finale when we were all droopy-eyed and so full. the first person who dug in literally shot up in excitement - it was that. good.   there were many more dishes but most were forgettable (i.e. the vegetables, ha). unfortunate that the bone marrow wasn't part of our tasting; the menu changes on a weekly basis, so no guarantees it'll be around on my next visit. the beast 120 happy hour intrigues me (who doesn't like good eats for cheap) and i'm looking forward to trying the brunch offerings.   Eating a zoo never tasted so good."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to be staying a block away when I was visiting Toronto.   The All Stars --Gnocchi Poutine: It's a a small app, but it was a perfect blend of crisp and fluffy. Yass.  --The Beastwhich: All my friends loved it and the chicken itself was really good.   The Mediocre --Pemeal Bacon Benedict: Kinda bland and I wish that though bacon on the outside was a little crispier.  --The Duck French Toast: The french toast itself was great, but the duck with it sounds better than it actually is.   Service was great and I would definitely come back again to try other things on the menu. I forgot my umbrella though, and when I returned a couple hours later, they told me that another patron had took it. Hold on to your belongings!"}
{"text":"Great no-fuss brunch spot! The frenchpress coffees are a delight. Definitely worth picking one of the \"sandwiches\" - no bread here, it's a scone / biscuit."}
{"text":"The Beast is located in a residential area, pretty much in a house.  The place is tiny, maybe 10 tables max.  There was a long lineup when we came and we had to wait in the freezing cold as they don't allow anyone to wait inside.  Makes sense as it is already small enough.  Once we got seated I got my eyes on the Beastwich - who can resist fried chicken with sausage, gravy, fried egg all between buttermilk biscuit. Omg the Beastwich was as advertised.  It was amazing.  Only dissapointment was the home-fries which wasn't crispy seem like they re-fried the one batch.We also got the Huevos Rancheros with Chorizo. It was okay but I prefer the Beastwich. We got a coffee too which was pretty cool.  They gave you a timer to let you know when you can prep it."}
{"text":"Beast was a very interesting place. The food was great the drinks were ok. The girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner after walking around town. The portions were a little small for the price but very tasty. I would try it again next time I'm in."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Went here for brunch on a short stay in Toronto and I was extremely satisfied! The wait to get a table was a bit long but worth it in the end. Everything from the fried gnocchi poutine to biscuits and gravy to breakfast sandwich was amazing! Great selection of small batch roasted coffee and fine teas for quenching your thirst.   A must try if visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've recently moved to the king west neighborhood and this place is rapidly becoming one of my favorite spots! Brunch was divine! I had the duck confit French toast and it was amazing.  We also went back for happy hour where they serve PEI oysters for $1 and it was just perfect with a glass of prosseco. Great for a hot Friday evening. I'll definitely go back again for more!"}
{"text":"Definitely going to be a regular here. They've changed things up recently with asian elements like scallions and kimchi in some of their more popular dishes. I'm definitely coming back to try to Pig Ears, but we ordered the House Special Sandwich (can't remember what it's called but it's smack in the middle of the menu and crazy delicious with egg, kimchi, and tons of other flavours). Also ordered the Boar Poutine. Now if you've never had boar, don't expect pulled pork flavor - it's more akin to beef. Fries are also more of the 'tator tot' variety, which was so nice to see, since as a brunch place, makes more sense to have those rather than full blown french fries.  Both dishes were very rich, full of flavour, and absolutely delicious. Staff are attentive, prompt and friendly.   Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Met up with friends and ended up dining here at the last minute. We had called at 9pm to make a reservation and they said that they only did walk-ins and that they were closing at 10pm. We were really close by, but we hustled over anyways. Food was great, server was friendly but definitely got the sense that the staff was ready to head home. Would recommend, but suggest you go well before closing time so you don't feel rushed."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving...  A thing to note was how little indication there was to the place being open.  Upon arrival, I thought this place was closed.  Standing right in front of it you can hardly tell.  I verified on Yelp, then tried the door. It was open! Good thing, because upon entering it smelled amazing. The waitress immediately noticed and told us what was cooking. Yum   Again, looks can be deceiving...  The portion I was served looked small but was very, very filling.  Had the crab cake with poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce.  When asked what kind of sides I wanted, the waitress offered to give me a little of both! Awesomesauce!   I'll be visiting here again to sample their other treats for sure"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. It's made in a house turned restaurant so not a lot of space and can get crowded. The breakfast here is good. Nice French toast and the huevos Spanish eggs were good. Will recommend the place to visit.."}
{"text":"HOLY $**T - I ATE A WHOLE BOAR!  Let me begin with the restaurant itself. It's small and cozy inside and has a nice warm feel to it. The staff are friendly and fun and well informed.  The Menu: There is the regular menu to order from....OOOOORRRRRRRR....you can do the 'whole animal' menu which is what we did. So you call in advance to reserve the date. If someone has already booked ahead of you that night and picked an animal, you have to eat the same animal. If you don't want to eat that animal, then go on a different date. The chef will prepare 5 courses for you plus a dessert, and you won't know what you're eating until it's brought to your table.  I had the wild boar.  First course: Pickled tongue with stracciatella, melon and fennel.  Second course: Grilled heart tostada with guacamole, herb salad. Third course: Face tasso 'poutine' with collard greens, gnocchi and curds. Fourth course: Grilled pork chop with chanterelle ragu. Fifth course: Pork shoulder with kimchi and peanuts. Dessert: Butter tart with bacon.  Okay....      Everything was delicious! I got a little nervous after the first course because it was so small...but by the end of the meal I was stuffed.  Everything was yummy and the flavours were good, however, nothing really blew my mind.  I would definitely go back. I loved the experience of eating all parts of the animal that I would never eat otherwise.   Be adventurous -check it out.  #beast"}
{"text":"If i have to wait 45 minutes for brunch, then it better be worth it. (side note: the brunch scene in Toronto is getting ridiculously annoying where everywhere requires you to wait forever to be seated. Maybe I'm getting old but dammit I'm getting tired of this! )   Beast is not.  After waiting 45 minutes to be seated, it took approximately another 45 minutes for us to order and get our food. The restaurant is tiny, with a very, very tiny kitchen. It seemed like they could only make one dish at a time. I ordered the pollo loco, my friend got the bruce leroy, and we ordered french toast to share. The donuts (which sounded good) were sold out.   I was ready to eat my arm when the food finally came out and it was... ho hum. The pollo loco had no lip smacking flavour - the chicken was slightly soggy, the ranchero sauce had no flavour and no kick. I ended up putting hot sauce on everything and even that was bland!   The french toast again was ho hum. It needed to be crispier - the best part was the whipped creme fraiche.   you get a little bodum of coffee - enough for two barely full mugs.   Overall, I wouldn't come back. Ever."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and quite simply the one of my most memorable brunch I've ever had. Got the breakfast plate with pork hocks and I highly recommended. The sweet and tangy sauce is reminiscence of asian flavours but it's very own. Eggs were excellent and season well and potatoes cooked to perfection. Partner had the challah bread duck confit french toast. Got two donuts and their sticky toffee pudding. All were great! The chefs really know what they are doing. Service was fine but they were a bit busy for be totally attentive but was prompt to get you whatever is needed (e.g. water and bill).  I would rank this restaurant to be in my Top 5 of all time.  Food 5/5 Atmosphere 4.5/5 Service 3.5/5  Would definitely come back again. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service was astoundingly bad. Server took 15 minutes to come to our table after we sat down. Our meal took over an hour to arrive. We watched another table who came in after we did finish their meal, pay and leave before we even got our food. We received coffee but no cream or sugar.  Then, after we finished our meal, we sat with the plates in front of us for at least 30 minutes. I walked up to the server to ask for our bill and she said yes, then proceeded to ignore us. We watched her clear empty tables while our plates were still sitting in front of us. She gave other people their bills and didn't look our way once. I finally had to stand and stop another waiter to get our bill. And all of this was going on while a long line of people was waiting outside for a table. Left angry and upset and would neither go back nor recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night after months and months of saying \" I really need to check out Beast\". I had high hopes for the place since I was a lover of it's predecessor in the same space, Amuse Bouche.   The space is as cozy as I remember it. Very intimate, homey setting. I find it very endearing to walk thru the kitchen to get to the bathrooms.   Here's the extensive list of the food that we had while we were there:  house pickles - just as one would hope pickled items would taste like  warm marinated olives  - who doesn't love a good warm olive  sheep's milk gnudi, brussels sprouts, dates, sage, walnuts - this was a very tasty dish. Well balanced  roasted kohlrabi, miso, kombu, bonito, sesame - I have never had Kohlrabi before but I think it might be a new favourite vegetable  canadian artisanal cheese plate  - the variety was very good   flat iron steak, black bean puree, cumin scented carrots, napa cabbage - probably  had the most flavour. Really enjoyed this dish  smoked drake breast, fall squash, wild mushroom, duck confit, apricot - again, very palette pleasing  \"poutine\", fried gnocchi, veal shank ragu, cheese curds - when I think comfort food, this is it. Incredible. Who doesn't love a pasta  / poutine combo?  The only cons I see with this space is that I found the ventilation poor so I ended up smelling like my entire meal when I left. Not that I minded but it did create some laundry when I didn't even spill on myself!. The other con is that I didn't find any of the service to be all that friendly. I will chalk that up to an off night though and try my luck again.   The food alone will have me returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!   Maple bacon donut - ah-may-ZING!! The breakfast sandwich... Even better!!  The portions are super filling.  They also have really interesting flavoured coffees which come out with a French press and a timer. When the timer goes off you press it down - making their coffee super fresh.   Totally drool worthy!   I'd totally come back and try other things."}
{"text":"This is the hidden gem of the city (well, not that hidden with 200+ reviews). We are here very often and love the ever-changing menus and tastes. The place may be small, but there is a whole lot of vibe both inside and outside. If you're with a toddler (like us), weekdays are perfect for visits. You may wait a bit, but nothing like the ridicilous waits of the hyped up spots.  The service is always excellent and servers are very well informed of the food.  I don't agree with any of the comments about portion size; I think the portion sizes are perfect for the taste they offer.  All menu items are perfectly priced."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times for brunch and it's been outstanding and well worth the wait required. The pork hocks alone are worth the trip: tender and juicy and fried into a beautiful, crisp cube, then served on kimchi. Just writing this makes me want to have more! Other dishes, like the Labbatt 50 breakfast or Beastwich, are equally satisfying. Staff are very friendly and know the dishes and their ingredients well. A big plus is that while this is a meat-forward place, they will serve a dish sans meat and charge a lesser price - something I wish more places did."}
{"text":"Oxford commas matter!!!  This food was really good. However, you might not get exactly what you are expecting. Many of the descriptions for the meals include lots of options, but the lack of Oxford commas means you may think you are getting eggs Benedict with avocado, bacon or smoked fish. However, you are really getting eggs Benedict with avocado, bacon, or smoked fish.  Its also way overpriced for what it is. We spent about $90 for three people including small portions and a $4 French press coffee that didn't end up filling much more than half of a regular mug. Its good, but probably not worth the wait."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM. This is a well deserved 5 star review.  I got the labatt breakfast which was 13 dollars and 15 if it came w a labatt blue. Everything was amazing and had great flavour!! The chorizo sausage was scrumptious!!!! And the eggs Were super fluffy and light! Service was slow but this place was packed because it definitely is a go to brunch spot.. The interior is lovely and it feels like your in a house having  breakfast!  Our server was super friendly and conversational, the interior experience was great and will return ( most likely on a not so popular brunch day since it was a bit of a wait- definitely come on a day you have time to kill and have no rush )."}
{"text":"I don't know . . . I think my non-Southeast Portland aversion to hipsters makes me despise this place from the get-go.  Oh.  Sorry.  I'm reviewing a restaurant in Toronto, not Portland (Oregon).  You see, Portland is more overrun with hipsters than anywhere else in the world.  Yes, I know you think you have more in Toronto or Seattle or New York or wherever you're from, but you don't.  We have billboards making fun of them.  The Foursquare badge for going to enough truly \"Portland\" spots is a drawing of a hipster.  We invented them.  We're sorry.  Beast is a page out of the Portland playbook.  The decor, the waitstaff, the food, all of it.  This isn't really a bad thing, but you have to do something special with your staff and/or food if you're going to truly win me over.  The breakfast sandwich was good, but it wasn't great.  In fact, it was pretty dry.  The overall idea and taste was pretty good, but it wasn't well balanced.  Same goes for the staff.  It was pretty dry.  There's nothing wrong with Beast, but I'm not buying a plane ticket to get back there and try it again.  For that matter, I'm not sure I'd invest in a bus ticket to get across town.  Maybe I'd pay for parking?"}
{"text":"They fixed the A/C. But of course, the weather was wonderful and we sat outside! Brunch #2 at Beast proved to be even better with a few exceptions. I really love this place and I think it will be come our new local for brunch etc...  The patio was comfortable and the service was excellent. We admired the fresh doughnuts that were being brought by the fabulous servers to neighbouring tables. I'm tempted, but I don't often do sweet-- especially for breakfast.   We had the \"poutine\" again, as my boyfriend had not tried it. Strangely, the meat on top was not the pulled beef from the week before, but a bolognese-type meat sauce. Not as good, but still pretty damn tasty.  I had the crispy pork hock with kimchee and I was in meat heaven. It was aptly described by our server as \"candied bacon\".  My boyfriend loved his Eggs Benedict and I'll admit that they were pretty damn good. I never order them because one of the chefs at my work makes what are, in my opinion, the best Benny in the city. These came pretty close.  The patio was lovely but I'm waiting for a cold winter afternoon to rock out with the fab music again. Upon my trip to the washroom, I noticed that it was nice and cool inside. Beast gets their 5th star for this as it was the only thing I could fault them for the last time.  I love this place for the lack of attitude, fantastic service, promotion of the boozy afternoon brunch and the amazing value. You can't have a brunch at Eggpectations for this price, and the food is really over the top delish!  LOVE."}
{"text":"Good food always comes from small places!  I had the Crispy Pork ears and The Beastwich sandwich and I was not disappointed!   The Crispy pork ears were great, well cooked but I found too much hot sauce on the ears themselves along with creme fresh and other toppings! It was a good combination but personally, I would have preferred a little less hot sauce ! IOverall great dish!  The sandwich was great! soft biscuit, gravy and my personal favorite, that they deep fried a THIGH! not a breast but a thigh! I think the sandwich was on-point ! Definitely need a fork and knife for this one!  PS: Great coffee as well!"}
{"text":"Happy to have finally tried this place; after tonight's meal, throwing up a solid 4/5. It smells delicious in there once you walk in. It's a casual place with rustic decor (think well worn tables).  We had a reservation for an early dinner. The entire restaurant seats approximately 15 people, so reservations are recommended. Our server was friendly and explained the tapas premise, suggesting 2-3 dishes per person. Everything was reasonably priced and there was a lengthy wine list which favoured bottles. I believe there was only 3 offerings for red, and 3-4 for white, so keep that in mind. I chose a 2012 Cab Franc/Sauv split, which had 5oz priced at $10.  We began with the house pickles (delicious), and the rapini which featured fermented black beans, chili, black vinegar, honey, and sesame. Both tasty.  I then had the mussels with celery root, crispy rice, and bacon. That dish was a bit understated for me. I also chose the poutine which delivered on its promise of cheese and braised pork.  My partner chose the prawn okonomiyaki, which featured tons of competing flavours, and I mean that in a very good way. We ended with the beef cheek, which melted in your mouth! So solid. The butternut squash underneath was also tasty enough to be eaten on its own.  I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I trusted the yelper's review and they didn't let me down! we went on Sun at 1pm. we waited for an hour and 15 min. The table for 2. it was too much waiting but we decided to wait and try this place. the fresh orange juice was great. the poutine came and we ate it with their spicy sauces. taste: HEAVEN. our sandwiches came. taste: you are in heaven! it did worth the wait. definitely going back."}
{"text":"We live in the heart of Queen West but had never tried Beast until Friday night.  We've definitely been missing out.  Reservations were easy through the website.  They also accommodated our request for patio seating, then when it was too cold moved us inside without any complaint.    Server was friendly and knowledgable.  He was awesome with our 4-yr-old son and more than made him feel welcome.    We had several dishes and every one was terrific.  We especially loved the gnocchi poutine dish and the lamb ribs."}
{"text":"Great place for a chicken sandwich! Got the beastwich - fried chicken was amazing. Place is a bit tiny, but cozy. We came on a Friday afternoon so it wasn't too busy or an issue for us. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch here one Saturday. There are no reservations for brunch - we waited about a half hour outside on their patio. Given the restaurant's unexpected location inside a house on a residential street, I guess we were really on their front yard.  The wild boar poutine is so good!! Easily the most memorable item for our visit. The 'fries' are these incredible, soft pillows of gnocchi that melt in your mouth. One order was enough for the three of us to enjoy a good tasting each. Any more of this rich dish would mean we wouldn't have had enough space for the rest of our yummy meal.  The duck confit challah French toast with cranberry sauce was excellent. The toast was luscious. However, personally, I think the duck would have been better on the side, rather than on top of the toast. All the elements were amazing on their own, but tasted strange as a combination.  The Sam James coffee was delicious and came in individual French presses. While unique in presentation and fresh in taste, it took longer than I'd like for my morning elixir to arrive.  Over all, a good experience!"}
{"text":"Did I eat at the same place as all these other high reviewers?! wow. went here for dinner and got some service with an attitude. No we've never eaten cod tongues and yes you don't have to be condescending while explaining the texture and size of tongues. Seemed to have an attitude every time they dropped off a plate, like really, if i'm clearly not done my dish then don't just pick it up, ASK to pick it up first. And enough about warning us about the fish sauce on these damn tongues, which weren't great, salty as fk. Even when packing the food, I said three times, just throw the left over tongues in there, I'm going to give them to my husband to ask what he thinks and each time the guys like no... I don't think you want to mix the taste with your other food, well guess what? offer me another takeaway box if you want to provide stellar service instead of discouraging me from taking home the food that I paid for! so much attitude! i've never been told i shouldnt take home food that i paid for... regardless of what it tastes like after being refrigerated, thats my right as a paying customer. the scallops were the most decent dish. A lot of the rest of the food was obscenely over salted. Lamb dish was just blah, mediocre. Hen seemed good but I was so stuffed that I barely had any - which btw, the server recommended 4-5 dishes between the two of us, we barely got through 3, talk about overselling. Would definitely not go back there."}
{"text":"New Year's Day: I've decided to start with a brunch in one of the best known restaurant in the west end in Toronto: Beast. The restaurant offers a Canadian menu focused on local meats & using the whole beast.  The menu offers a good variety of cured, smoked meats. Two items in particular caught our attention: - The breakfast sandwich: grilled pork belly, pickled onions, kozlik's sweet and smokey mustard, lettuce and fried egg on a biscuit served with potatoes.  - Crispy pork hocks, tossed in kecap manis and served with house kimchi, two eggs (choose over easy style), toast, potatoes and mix greens.   For drinks we chose to go with two of three blends of coffee offered on the menu: Ethiopian and Peruvian.   The food overall, despite its richness in flavour, combines the ingredients really well without having one ingredient overpowering the other, resulting in a well balanced sandwich that would leave you craving for more.   The service demonstrated to be attentive and well acknowledged, never invasive.   Washrooms are clean and in good state.   Overall, a great experience I highly recommend to anyone who wants to try something a little different than the usual burger/sandwich offered by the vast majority of places on the scene."}
{"text":"I really liked the unpretentious atmosphere at Beast. Needless to say, I was overdressed. So close to King West, this spot offers ultimate comfort and privacy, not to mention great brunch food.  I was hesitant at first because the menu was so meat heavy (What's wrong with me?!!) You can definitely smell the smokiness from a mile away--alas, people will be able to smell YOU from a mile away after you've dined there!   Disappointed after we learned that the maple bacon doughnuts were sold out--our pains were instantly soothed by our personal french presses & Sam James coffees. The mini timers that accompany the french presses are a nice little touch. If you must annoy your neighboring diners--let it ring for a while. My generous portion of challah french toast was delicious. The creme fraiche was sublime and the compote equally so. The extra side of bacon is highly recommended. They're like strips of magic.   Service was quick and pleasant. This is one brunch place I'd come back to over and over again--of course, with a mini febreze bottle hiding in my purse."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch while working in the neighborhood.  I ordered the beastwich.  While waiting the staff were great.  The place is quaint.  The order came to the table and it looked spectacular.  The gravy was awesome.  The moist biscuit, it all worked really well.  I liked the option of having the half salad half roasted potato.    An exceptional meal in a great place.  Don't miss this place it is a true gem.  Food 10/10 Ambience 9/10 Service 10/10  Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Small innovative menu. Ragu poutine very good, cod tongue salad was a nice light complimentary dish....  and staff was very accommodating when I didn't have a reservation"}
{"text":"First time there and it was awesome. Service was great and the venue was lively! I ordered their Eggs Benedict with French press coffee and it definitely lived up to the hype! I'm from California and this will definitely be a place I will go to again when I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Beast is my favourite local spot for half-price wine Wednesday's. Local farmers much supported here with a small-plate approach. Good place for conversation- snug inside, with patio."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in at Tecumseth between King W and Queen W. It's small with a few tables outside.  I would say that the tapas is more on the higher price end and well, of course tapa-sized. Also, the food is predominantly local, with wild meats. I should say that the menu isn't accommodating to those who don't eat pork... I'd say that 9/10 menu items contain pork. That leads me to say that the waitress wasn't very familiar with the menu which is somewhat concerning. I grew up in the family business so I know that it's important that the waitresses are knowledgeable of the menu items - fixed items as well as seasonal.   Service is okay. Food was good."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some tasty brunch, this is the place. The chicken club was really good. The tenderness of the meat worked well with the cheese. Also I would recommend the dark + stormy cocktail. It seemed really popular during brunch time, so be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Came back here again for a feast! Tried their bacon maple donut and popcorn caramel mmmmmmmm. Delicious. Came right at 10 and it started packing up around 11!! Their dishes are also pretty filling so be prepared to take an afternoon nap afterwards! Service was on point and loved the circle table seating by the window!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! My fiancé and I ordered the The Beastwich Sandwich. The biscuit was extremely good- I feel like it made the sandwich. The chicken was also excellent. I feel like they used corn flakes or something like that as the reading before frying it and it was so good. We got the maple bacon donut which was also very fresh. The mini French press coffee (we ordered the raspberry jam and peanut butter one) was good, but it wasn't very unique as I couldn't really taste that \"flavoring.\" Overall, phenomenal place would recommend anyone to go here for brunch."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait a while before writing a review to see if my feelings would change as I usually get caught up in everything when visiting a city. Four weeks later and I am still thinking about the food I had here. I came across Beast on several must-eat lists for Toronto, but what really cemented the choice was seeing it on Anthony Bourdain's list for the city as well.   The restaurant isn't very large so you get a comfortable and intimate feel while dining. The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic in helping us choose what to get as everything looked amazing. To be honest, everything outside of the food was a blur.   We ordered the brussel sprouts, poutine, pork hocks, beef cheek, mad maple sandwich, Bruce Leroy sandwich, and the beastwich. I don't remember a time I was so excited for every bite of my meal. Everything was cooked perfectly and lit up my taste buds in a way I will never forget. From start to finish every bite of every dish was exquisite and I was literally left speechless as we left. A friend in the group, who owns his own catering company and restaurant, was left in the same state.   I rarely go back to restaurants when I visit a city because there are so many options, but Beast is now a must if and when I go back to Toronto. My mouth is watering as I write this and I'm considering booking a trip just to eat here all weekend."}
{"text":"Despite the 30 minute wait (I suggest you just walk along queen street while you wait because there's so much to see in this neighbourhood), this place was delicious for brunch. We both got the Beastwiches with potatoes and salad as 50/50 sides. Absolutely amazing. Chicken was cooked perfectly (could've been a little hotter in temperature and seasoned a bit better) with a crisp outside and soft juicy inside. The biscuit and chicken were both covered in a smooth and yummy sausage gravy. Potatoes were seasoned well and salad had a great vinaigrette! Overall just a great first meal here. If I wasn't so stuffed from the sandwich I would've definitely gotten the daily special donuts they get delivered by Rochelle. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Holy crap! Today for late lunch, we started with deep fried pickles and the gnocchi beef cheek ragout poutine. Then we tied into a Beastwich.  Along the way we had a couple of beers.   And then we crawled back to work. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I hosted an Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE) at Beast as part of my mission to try all the restaurants listed in the Toronto Star's \"7 Meals in the GTA worth the wait.\"  I had made reservations 3 days prior, and they were able to accommodate our party of 10.  They call the day of to confirm your reservation.  Beast is tucked away on a side street at King and Bathurst and is easily overlooked unless you know its there.  We were provided 3 \"bottles\" of water for our group which was much appreciated because I don't think playing \"pass the dutch\" with such a huge group would've been fun and could've led to spilling accidents.  Beast is a house-converted restaurant with two pieces of interesting art on the wall.  Think Minotaur but more vulgar.  On one side you have a man with a rooster's head and feet and some foliage to cover up the private parts.  On the other side you have a woman lying on her belly with the head and feet of a doe.  I think the artist is trying to play up the phrase \"You are what you eat?\"  After a short while, the waitress came to take our orders.  Once all the orders were scribbled down, we got presented with bread.  One was a harder bread with poppy seed, and the other was much softer, almost like a brioche.  The butter was spreadable.  Bonus points!  We ordered several dishes to share: Duck Hearts - served on skewers with pickled radicchio & olives and eggs.  I don't think I cared much for the texture of the duck hearts as it was sort of rubbery and just didn't tickle my taste buds.  I am still trying to figure out what type of egg they used as it did not appear to be a chicken egg.  The radicchio mélange was quite tasty, although the olives were a tad bit salty. Farinata - wild speckled trout served on a naan-like bread.  It was also adorned with radish, pesto, and goat's cheese.  This was a very tasty item.  The trout was very savoury and the goat cheese was creamy.  Mmmm... Fried Chicken Livers- served with fennel, beet root, and ranch dressing  Its deep fried, its liver... need I say more?  Poutine - made with gnocchi, wild boar and creme fraicheWho says poutine has to be made with fries?  Gnocchi is also made with a potato base but is more commonly seen as a pasta.  Here, it is slightly floured and then pan-fried and topped with wild boar and creme fraiche.  This was one of my favourites of the evening because what Toronto doesn't need is another joint claiming to serve the best poutine;  sorry folks but we aren't in Montréal and none of you hold a flame. Charcuterie - pork terrine, foie gras, elk rissolo(sp?), wild boar mortadella and duck prosciutto served with a grainy mustard, olives and pickles.  This was my favourite dish of the evening.  There was not one item on this charcuterie board that was not good.  My favourite, however, would have to be the foie gras.  It was smooth like a baby's bottom and went extremely well with bread. Sweetbreads - served on a bed of collard greens  Again, anything deep fried always tastes better.  The collard greens were very flavourful.  Other items that were ordered but that I didn't sample: Crepes - chocolate crepes with a white chocolate buttercream served with oranges.Farmhouse Burger - served with peameal bacon, a fried egg, and tater tots.  Verdict:  Beast is a restaurant that will take you outside your culinary comfort zone.  It is a great place to order a variety of dishes and sample, sort of like dim sum.  The food is not for the faint of heart or for vegetarians.  While the food itself was interesting and savoury, the service was lacking.  The pace that the food went from kitchen to table varied and I had to ask twice for the server to bring me milk for my coffee."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a cold Saturday morning and waited 30 minutes for a table, which is typical of a good brunch place. We did not expect it to be a corner house, however based on the reviews, I was expecting a great brunch.   We ordered the gnocchi poutine to start, with Indian-spiced gravy. It was a small portion for the price. We ordered a beastwich and a duck confit French toast for our mains. The beastwich was good, however the chicken was fairly dry and also small in portion. Didn't find anything special there. The duck confit French toast was a weird combination and we could not even finish half the portion. The French toast was fluffy but would not recommend the duck confit on it - it has turned us away from duck ever since!"}
{"text":"DAWWWGGGG THE BEASTWICH is sooo solid. Although the place can be super busy, Beast is definitely the go to spot if you are looking for a filling breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group last week and had a good night out. It was -17 degrees and there was a full, cozy, packed house!   The complimentary bread that was served was nice and fresh. I savoured each sip of the delicious apple sparkling cider, which was served cold.   We sampled the bottomless bowl of olives. I prefer the green ones to the black. We also sampled the sweet potato dish, which was served with hazelnuts and feta. This dish was just mediocre for me. I had the poutine, which was served with fried gnocchi (instead of fries), braised pork, and cheese curds. I found this dish to be rather salty. The best was certainly saved for last. I am not at all fond of sticky toffee pudding, but I opted to try it for dessert, as I didn't care for the other choices available. Am I ever glad I had it! It was so deliciously moist and the caramel sauce was divine!    Our server, Jeff, was very accommodating, pleasant, and ensured we were taken care of. One thing I don't like is that the restaurant is not properly ventilated. My hair, clothes, and coat smelled of food. It was quite cold in the restaurant, as well. Otherwise, I had a good night out."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience, delicious French pressed coffee, great taste in music but not too loud to prevent conversation. Great natural lighting, awesome service, and to be honest the bathrooms were immaculate. Hand towels. I mean, COME ON.  Salmon Benedict and potatoes but wasn't too heavy for brunch, my girlfriends Mad Maple Sandwich is highly recommended. Also the dressing on her salad (I think it was some sort of lemon ginger dressing) went really well with it. Would definitely recommend coming here and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My expectations for Beast was quite high due to the strong reviews for it on Yelp. It's situated in a residential area so you might miss it and the inside is quite cozy and chill. I ordered the huevos rancheros and substituted the sheep's milk feta for any other cheese (they did cheddar). My boyfriend ordered the ace hill breakfast + sides of pork belly (2pc) and chorizo sausage (1pc).   The huevos rancheros was good, it had a spicy kick to it with the chorizo sausage. It was very dense and filling, and I felt like too much was going on in one bite so it was hard to tell what you were eating. The extra side of pork belly was okay, as I don't think I like it fried, and I really enjoyed the chorizo sausage. But they (esp the chorizo) was def not worth an extra $6 each.   Overall, the service was good and the food was decent but I think I've been to other places that I enjoyed more."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has a very unassuming exterior.   Food: food was amazing, very unique and delicious. Came in for a work lunch which lasted a tad longer than we liked but was worth every bite. The beast with was amazing but the real show stopper was the toffee pudding at the end.   Fair warning you're going to walk out of here smelling delicious."}
{"text":"Overview: good food,  a bit pricey for the portions,  nice atmosphere.  Would only go back out of curiosity of the changing menu.   Decided to try this place on a Friday night based on the reviews here and the feature on Food Network's  You Gotta Eat Here. I like that they promote sustainable and local foods.  Atompshere: The location is small and unassuming. Arriving around 830, there was no issue getting a table.  The atmosphere inside was quaint with eclectic taste in artwork. Due to the small size of the location it can get loud pretty quickly.  At one point I was shouting at my friend across the small table.   Food: They serve tapas style dishes so for the most part everything is shareable (which is nice if you're trying for the first time and an ever changing menu).  Between the three of us we ordered the potato tikka masala, scallops with rabbit meat,  \"poutine\" (gnocchi), boar sausage pasta (can't remember the actual dish name), and drake breast (duck). Fresh bread was served with butter as well.  Of the dishes we tried out favourite was the drake breast.  Flavourful duck breast with the vegetables cooked in bacon fat,  what more could one as for.  Second was the pasta,  the sausage had a good flavour and soft broken texture.  I found the pasta to be slightly firmer than al dente,  but they may have been the way the dish was intended (not sure).  Bread crumbs also added a good crunch to the dish.    All in all it was a good experience with flavourful food.  However with the price and size of the dishes,  I would only come back to try the changing menu out of curiosity."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Thursday morning. My friend had the eggs Benedict with pea-meal bacon and the home fries, while I had the eggs Benedict with smoked fish and half home fries half salad. I highly recommend the half home fries and half salad, the salad is so delicious (and with the half and half the plate looks more instagram worthy). My smoked fish was DELICIOUS. It looks like a fish salad, but the flavors are all there. The hollandaise is also amazing. Service was a bit slow considering it was a weekday, and not very busy. However, this restaurant doesn't mess around, they give you a timer for your drinks, my tea had a timer so I'd know when my tea was perfectly steeped! Great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"Short story: if you want to eat here for breakfast, get here early / when it opens. You might still have to wait a while for your grub, but it's worth it. Order a donut to tide yourself over. You can't order booze until 11:00 a.m. You cannot go wrong with the plain beastwich, it's a masterpiece. Choose salad, not potatoes.   Long story: We made a plan the night before to get here on time for brunch. We arrived at 10:15 and got the last table on the patio. We're lunchers, not brunchers, so this was a novelty. I decided to celebrate with a brunch drink -- there's a section on the menu called this. When I ordered, I found out you're not allowed to serve/order booze in Toronto before 11:00. Really?!   As hopes for breakfast bevvies were dashed all over the patio, the server tried to distract us with the house-made donuts. We shared the one everyone was raving about, the maple bacon. It was covered with real bacon shavings. Odd, and yummy, great texture.  People started squirming on the patio because service was super slow, as in no food was coming out. A bunch of plates were delivered to the patio en masse, an hour after we arrived, including our Beastwiches. We both got the signature one, with sausage gravy, fried egg and pimento cheese. This is an incredible sandwich, and a real killer. We didn't eat again that day.  The salad dressing is amazing, there's lemongrass in it!! It's perfectly refreshing interspersed with the rich, carby impact of the beastwich. I got half and half salad and potatoes, but next time I'll have 100% salad. Why? The potatoes are not that good (they tasted stale, edges like rubber), likely the only un-yummy thing at Beast."}
{"text":"How do they make all that great stuff in that tiny little kitchen?  The beastwich is the way to go. I was most surprised by how good the biscuit was. Obviously they nailed the chicken and gravy, but the biscuit was memorable.  Brisket was a little too smoky, almost tasted artificial. It was topped with a very good coleslaw, finely chopped and with not too much mayo. But I'd opt for a chicken dish over this in the future.  Service was very friendly, the wait wasn't bad, and Beast generally lived up to expectations. The sticky toffee pudding offered on the menu was a good touch, too - you don't see that too often. (It was -- surprise -- pretty good.)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning right when doors opened at 10am and the restaurant was already 80% full. Since this place doesn't take reservations and the event space itself isn't massive, the quick and efficient service made it easy for us to dine within an hour.   We ordered the maple bacon doughnut ($3/each), challah french toast and the beastwich. Needless to say, the food met all of our expectations, was tasty and filling, and I anticipate finding a time to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the US, stumbled upon this and so glad I did.  This is a neighborhood gem and you must visit! Its right off the King Street streetcar line if you don't want to drive. There's outdoor seating and service is quick even with a steady stream of customers.    CLASSIC: So the talk of the town is the Beastwich so of course I had to see what the rave was about. It was worth every calorie. :) Chicken, egg, gravy, on a biscuit - oh my!   POUTINE: is life!! No matter how big the Beastwich was I couldn't leave without trying their poutine.  And its always refreshing when the poutine is different. Today's delicious creation was pork chili with dressing. Amazeballs.  TIP: as others have said, the place is small and will fill up quick. Line starts forming for seating at around 940am for their 10am open. pack your patience if you happen to drop in during one of their busy moments. Its worth the wait.   RATING: Five stars because of excellent service and excellent food. Im sad I forgot to order my doughnut before I left - next time for sure."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here from all the great pics I saw on yelp. When my boyfriend and I arrived we asked to put our name on the list for two. We were told the wait would be 35 minutes. We noticed that people were being called in no particular order. When 45 minutes passed I went in to ask the hostess how much longer. She said oh let me circle that you're here - and then told me it would be an additional 15 minutes. It was frustrating to say the least to find that we were probably not even considered because our name hadn't been circled even though we were waiting outside as told the entire time. We looked at her list of names and there was no order whatsoever; no system at all. Sadly, this really tarnished our overall experience. While the food was tasty, the customer service was very poor and frankly that can totally ruin a customers experience - which was the case in this scenario."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago with some of my cousins on our little food tour of Toronto and this was on our \"must try\" list and it did not disappoint. The restaurant itself was pretty small so it's best if you make reservations and not go with a larger crowd. We went as a larger group (6 adults and 1 child) and that was about the limit on the one group size.   Service was excellent and pretty much everything we ordered was pretty amazing. We ordered about 10 items off the menu and each were flavorful and delicious (with a healthy serving of oils and grease).   It's also pretty expensive so if you're going there on a date, be prepared to drop at least $150 between two people.  Would definitely recommend.  If you're not a big meat eater, I would avoid this place (hence the minus one star because I wished they had a lighter, healthier dish but who am I kidding when the name of the restaurant is Beast?!).  Parking: Limited paid street parking Price: $$$ Wait: 5-15 mins between dishes"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere delicious coffee delivered in a French press, good food and excellent donuts."}
{"text":"A warm inviting dining room, eclectic artwork adorning the walls, Beast makes no bones (pun intended) about what is on the menu here.  Like other new restos that have picked up on the renewed interest in cooking with all parts of the animal, Beast distinguishes itself by offering interesting and well prepared dishes. For example, \"poutine\" emerges as fluffy nuggets of potato and cornmeal in a wonderfully rich savoury sauce, oozing with melted cheese and jus. My beet salad followed by A half filet of fish was delicious and flakey but not enough to fill me and so I had to have a 3rd dish.  That's when i decided to order the burger. A \"burger\" comes on a home-made English muffin, smiley face chipotle mayo and topped with a fried egg.  The meat patty is no mere ground beef and tastes distinctly of chopped steak.  Pick up the whole burger and let all that sexy yolk and sauce ooze as you bite into it.     If you manage to save a bit of the bun, use it to sop up all that wonderful yolk.  Great stuff I tell ya.  Dont worry, utensils are provided but eating with my hand seemed like right the thing to do.    Our waitress was wonderful - friendly and attentive.   Beast prepares made to order \"whole beast\" meals for which you must order a week in advance.   For this you get exactly what it says, different parts of the beast all in different dishes (on order this week, elk, wild boar, rabbit, duck).-- next time! Beast was most definitely a feast!"}
{"text":"Yummy Tapas style place in a great location. Will not be disappointed, better be a carnivore however. Weird wall art for sure."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood gem does not disappoint. Service is super fast and friendly. The food is delicious and portions are large. I like the beastwich, French toast and pork hocks. The fried pickles are delicious too."}
{"text":"Great spot. Got seated quickly. Good, fresh coffee options. The food was perfect- had the huevos and husband had the fried chicken on toast *forgot what it was called*, the multi-layered flavor was beautiful. That salad....had to stop the waitress to ask about the dressing...can't put my finger on what the ingredient was but it was the perfect blend of zesty, sweet and savory. You can tell the chef put care in their work and everything was fresh. Never write Yelp reviews, but this is one brunch spot that I walked out feeling like it was worth every single penny."}
{"text":"Beast has been on my list of restaurants for awhile, after seeing it featured on You Gotta Eat Here! It took some time convincing friends to check this place out. It's an unassuming restaurant tucked away in a side street, just off King & Bathurst, with a pretty sweet happy hour. $5 drinks and buck-a-shuck oysters? Yes, please!  The menu changes regularly, but the shining star is the Beastwich ($11). I've had my fair share of fried chicken and biscuits and gravy, but this combination was one of the best! We didn't get it with the fried egg, but it was already rich with the pool sausage gravy. The fried chicken was nice and crispy and the biscuits were moist. The beef heart tartare ($7) and albacure tuna ceviche ($5) were great value at that price. And we all really liked the grilled squid ($12), which we hope becomes a staple on the menu.  Looking forward to my next visit, and can't wait to see what other dishes they come up with on future menus!"}
{"text":"A Weary Traveler's Calming Comfort Food  My wife and I arrived in Toronto after fighting rush hour traffic and immediately went looking for someplace to eat dinner.  My wife had researched before the trip and suggested Beast.  I agreed that it sounded interesting and concurred.  So we walked across downtown to get there.  We caught their $10 Tuesdays special.  We ordered 3 different dishes to share, and they came one after another.  We started with the Bistro Greens with Chicharrones, Garlic Scapes, and Wild Ginger.  This highly flavorful salad was an excellent starter.  Then we were served the Duck Confit with Hoisin on Green Onion Pancake with Fermented Black Bean and Bonito Flakes.  I'd thought that the first dish was good.  This was wonderful!  The balance of the ingredients emphasized the duck and .... Yum!  And then the Piece de Resistance came.  The Gnocchi \"poutine\" with gravy of the day arrived.  I didn't think that they could top the duck, but WOW.  My new favorite dish.  I asked if they served a heaping mound of this on other days, and they said that there's always some sort of poutine on the menu, and they keep the gnocchi on hand.  Wow.  I will come back JUST for this.  I had a great wine that we're trying to find elsewhere - 2011 Stanners vineyard Straw House Red.  When I get back to Toronto, I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a birthday party and was told we had to go with set menu which cost $60 per person.   Definitely not worth the money.  When making the reservation, person I spoke to said that set menu would pretty much allow you to try everything on menu but it wasn't even close.   All we were served was a bunch of apps and bread.   Definitely not worth the money.   Considering that bill came up to $1800, was expecting at least a few main courses or at least some of the chicken sandwiches.  Avoid this place if you have a large party unless your ok with spending a lot of money but not getting much in return."}
{"text":"\"If you are in search of an original spot away from the beaten path, The Beast should be on your list. The food is very original, somewhat on a pricier side, but worth the experience.\"  This is just a bite of our review.."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, biscuits, and donuts for brunch? YES PLEASE.   I got here around noon for Saturday brunch and the place was packed. My friend and I put our names down and waited patiently outside (in the cold) for about 40 minutes. While you're waiting, there's a menu outside which you can use to decide what you want to order so you can order as soon as you get a table. I only wish they would start taking numbers so that you could roam around while you wait and they'll text you once your table is ready.   Apart from the standard French toast, and breakfast plates, they have their fried chicken sandwiches. My friend got the Beastwich and I got the Bruce Leroy. I actually preferred the Bruce Leroy over the Beastwich because the sweet soy sauce was a nice contrast to the biscuit and fried chicken. Their duck confit French toast also looks fantastic.   Also, you really can't leave without getting a donut. They have daily specials, so the flavours are always changing. The donuts are super doughy and a little chewy. A perfect way to end your meal and put you into a deep state of (food) comatose."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back again! The place is a bit small, so I recommend reserving ahead of time if you want to get a seat. It was around a 10 minute wait for two, but I thought it was well worth it!   I would definitely say their Huevos Rancheros was top-notch. The extra dollars are worth it for the chorizo meat. It's small and cozy, but it's definitely a place worth stopping by when you're in the city"}
{"text":"Wow. After a hiatus of Yelp reviewing, I just had to comment on how awesome our experience at Beast was. This review is specifically about weekend brunch. We came recently on a Saturday morning right at 10:00 AM. There were already patrons being seated when we arrived. By the time 10:20 AM rolled around, all the tables were full. If you don't want to wait, I'd come earlier than later.  Secondly, parking. If you're driving over on a Saturday morning, note that there's free street parking in the area.  Third, the food. We weren't terribly hungry and decided to split , a) the Beastwich and b) the 3 donut specials of the day (2 for $5, or one for $3.00). The Beastwich was very filling, and was so, so delicious. The biscuit was light and flaky, and the chicken was full of flavour. However, the highlight of the meal for me were the donuts. They weren't too heavy, the right level of sweetness or spice (depending on the type of donut), and had the perfect dough-y texture (definitely not starchy, or Tim Horton's donut-like).   The overall atmosphere, friendliness of the staff, and quirky menu offerings, made for a wonderful brunch experience and, while a bit pricier than a usual brunch, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. For a Beastwich, a Sam James coffee, and 3 donuts, with tax and tip, our brunch total was $35.09."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Saturday. Tried the Fried pickles, Beastwich and Mad Maple.  Food is superb! :)"}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour on Fridays with a few friends.  They have all sorts of fancy yet fun appetizers like tater tot poutine, duck hearts and charcuterie.     The staff was very friendly and on top of our drinks and let us order happy hour appetizers until the last minute.    For the price, selection, and cozy atmosphere, this is a great place for a few drinks after a long week."}
{"text":"Hip, fresh, but overpriced.  Needs a more affordable local wine list.  Tasting menu was an interesting experience, but some of the courses were disappointing - specifically a rabbit served with curried lentils - the curry completely overpowered the rabbit leaving no other taste discernible.  Our entire party agreed it simply could have been chicken, there was no way to know.      We had some sticker shock when we got the bill, especially considering we had ordered the cheapest wine on the menu.  For the $300 price of two people having tasting menus with a bottle of wine, we could have been in a far better restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing aroma and food as a brunch place. Had tried their beef tongue sandwich and crab cake benedict, both tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"We went there for a brunch. They have an awesome coffee choice, all made with a French press (and a timer to have it the perfect way!!!). We had the French toasts (with duck), the Benedict eggs and the fifty plate. Everything was very good! Potatoes are the best!"}
{"text":"Had dinner their last night and it was delicious experience.  Great snack menu before 7pm.  Favourite dish by far was the fried cod tongues, absolutely delicious.  Every dish was an experience and highly recommend Beast for dinner."}
{"text":"I had read enough good reviews for this place and decided \"why the heck not? \" I love brunch. Brunch and I...we're homies. So considering they had fried chicken I knew I had to take my bf here for surprise brunch date. Firstly, there isn't a lot of parking options there so be aware that you may want to try and go early to find a parking spot alone. Secondly, they do not take reservations for brunch. It's first come first serve. Thank goodness it was not very cold outside so I was prepared to wait. We got the 2nd last table for two. I have to say that the decor inside was very cozy and clean. The ambiance was warm, a nice flow of conversation all around but I never had to shout. I was able to speak in very low and comfortable tone. Our server was very prompt to have our utensils and water for us. We ordered their gnocchi poutine, the beastwich, the crab cakes benny , and the French press coffee in the decaf flavour (due to acid being lower in the decaf). Have to note that their washrooms are super nice and clean. They give you a little timer for when to press and drink your coffee. Coffee was very delicious (for $4 makes around 1.5 cups). The gnocchi was good featured a curry sauce (not overwhelming at all) the boar was very tender. It was nice to try something new however I don't think I'd order this again, not really worth the price or the flavour. The beastwich was very good can get salty but that's too be expected. Crab cakes Benny was good however didn't really get a big taste of the crab cakes. In my opinion, this is a very good place for brunch and I would definitely come back for the beastwich . Just know ahead of time that the coffee is a must try and the fried chicken on the menu is very good. The Benny's I would probably skip here... Can get pricey so know that too."}
{"text":"I have been here about a year ago and recently visited again. This has to one of the absolute best places in toronto. The food is excellent. I mean excellent. Flawless. So good. Portions are perfect. Price is affordable. Vibe is chill. The staff are OK. It's not a 5 star service type of place but the food is amazing. Brunch for 2 with alcohol, approx 47$. The crab cakes are heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Saturday brunch. We got super lucky that we arrived close to opening: 10:07 and there was already a 10 minute wait.  The food took quite a while,  but is absolutely worth the wait. BF got the daily scramble and I got the pork hocks. We also were seated long enough that we were able to try the Caesars after 11 am. In my opinion, the classic Caesar is spicier and a little bit tangier than the all-Ontario Caesar.  Depends what you like. The meal was perfect and the rest of the menu looks amazing as well.  I would 100% recommend this restaurant. If I had a chance to go back,  the poutine gnocci sounds fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing... I'm still drooling thinking about the fried chicken on biscuit I had for brunch two weeks ago. On top of that we had the venison on gnocchi poutine... never thought those words would ever exist in the same dish before BEAST!  No reservations for brunch and we came in the middle of the rush so it was over a half hour wait. It would have definitely been a longer wait if my friend and I didn't intervene with how they wanted to seat the 2 groups of 2 in front of our group of 4. None the less we got in and the food was well worth the wait.   We also had their caesars (really good, hits the spot but could use more pickled goodness on top besides a sliced pickle)  The servers were mostly friendly but they were just so busy we had to flag down different servers for different things.   So first the chicken and biscuit (pollo loco): Huge portions for a brunch item, the chicken was perfectly crispy and flavorful on the outside and moist on the inside. The biscuit wasn't the flakiest or most buttery I've had but it worked to soak up all the delicious flavors on the plate including avocado and the potatoes were seasoned so nicely. The hot sauce they provided was a nice touch!  My friend had the chorizo and eggs breakfast, she didn't like it very much because the chorizo was so meh. The poutine was delicious, lots of cheese curds and meat all on top of fried crispy gnocchi topped with a delicious gravy! Everyone else in the group got the chicken and biscuit and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'd love to come back for their dinner sometime soon, they really do meat well ^_^ Next time donuts before they run out!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch during a time when the sky was off and on opening up to downpours.   They had great reviews, so it makes sense that lots of other people wanted to experience the goodness that Beast had to offer.   I was a bit taken aback when we arrived to see a waiting list on the door and a crowd huddled outside to shield themselves from the rain, but we put our name on the list and waited.   An hour later......we were called for our seat. Once inside the food was amazing and the service was on point. They explained that they were short staff plus the crowd was a bit larger today and the rain was limiting the ability to use the tables outside so it was the perfect storm resulting in long wait times.   We got the maple chicken and biscuits.  So good, I mean absolutely delicious. We also started out with mimosas and then I decided I wanted to taste a Caesar. It seemed very Canadian and I needed to understand the difference between that and a Bloody Mary. To no fault of Beast, I didn't like the Caesar, but hey, I don't really like bloody Mary's either, so I'm certain this is no fault of Beast.   I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Honestly. This is a perfect case of how one bad employee can really tarnish an experience. The food here is amazing, NEXT LEVEL. I can't stress that enough. When it comes to the food, it is perfect.   The hostess on the other hand, is a different story. I guess she also serves? Because she is never at the front. There are empty tables and a wait list? She acts so frazzled, and I am sorry this place  seats less than 100 people. She goes on about how the kitchen won't let her seat... I worked at a much busier much bigger restaurant than this and that is not how you run a restaurant. If you want to stagger tables so the kitchen can keep up, great. It helps service. That doesn't mean not seating people and generally being rude.   So who ever owns beast, this chick is losing you customers everyday.   AMAZING food tho!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of the standard eggs benedict and big breakfast brunch offerings of other restaurants, Beast is a great place to check out. I went on a Sunday right at opening time (a line-up develops quickly) and had the Beastwich - a fried chicken thigh and pimento cheese on a buttermilk biscuit, with a side of 50/50 home fries and salad (nice of them to offer this option). The Beastwich was good, savoury and filling without being cloyingly greasy. I do feel that it could have benefited from another sauce, as the hot sauces provided either tasted too much like garlic or too much like vinegar.   Overall, it was a good experience but not especially noteworthy. However, I appreciated the creativity in the menu offerings and would recommend trying it if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. We had a large group of 7 people but they said it would only be a 15 minute wait. This turned out to be more like 30 minutes because they seemed to be understaffed that day. Our table was cleared within 15 minutes of waiting but there was no one free to clean it and set the table again for us.  After waiting half an hour to be seated, we immediately ordered. I was really craving their maple-bacon donuts but they were out that day! Apparently their baker was out of town. I was so disappointed but settled for the fried gnocchi poutine as a starter instead and split the challah French toast with a friend.  The fried gnocchi poutine was really good. I thought it would be an overload of carbs but it was actually a good portion and the sauce they covered it with tasted a lot like eating a sloppy joe. The challah French toast with duck confit was surprisingly delicious too. The sweet French toast mixed well with the savory duck confit and they topped it off with a huge spoonful of whipped cream.  Another friend ordered the beastwich, which she highly recommended. Their gravy was great and the whole sandwich is topped with a fried egg.  I'd come back again for their food and hopefully to try their maple-bacon donuts next time!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Poutine was alright and scallops were good.  Highlight was the sticky toffee pudding!"}
{"text":"Tried to walk in a few times but they never have a table unless you make a reservation! Super relaxed non-pretentious place, near King west but on a quieter street with a nice little patio in front perfect for the summer!  On weekdays from 5-7pm they have a great snacking menu $1 OYSTERS on the shell with a selection $5 DRINKS + plus a patio = doesnt get any better than this! We also got a amuse bouche to start of a little cornbread square, with fried cheese and some green strawberries.   After going through a few oysters, we got a squid tostada, which came with gauc, grapefruit and lots of different herbs, really refreshing. The mussels on toast was a bit tangy, there were lots of capers in it, but the serving size was good and came with a lot of mussels. I also got the duck breast which came with a mole sauce. The duck was cooked nicely and tender and the sauce was delicious (although a bit on the cold side). Overall though everything was delicious.  Inside was dark and cozy and the staff was friendly and helpful. We never felt rushed during the meal"}
{"text":"This review is for their brunch... I'd like to give 3.5 stars but since I can't I'll round up to 4.  We arrived at 10am because we were a party of 8 and we were glad we did. While no one else was there at 10am, by 11:00am there was a line out the door.  I liked the look of the place, small, intimate, cozy, just what you want for a feast of meat. :)  We started with coffees and teas which all came with little timers... sounds good in theory but when they started going off it was kind of annoying. I'm all about enjoying food (or beverages) at their best but no need to over complicate life.  For starters we ordered a few rounds of donuts, banoffee and maple bacon. The banoffee donuts were pretty good, the maple bacon were ok. Interesting but the bacon tasted a bit like bacon bits. I'm not saying they were bacon bits but they tasted a little like them.  We also tried the dirty rice balls, which were clearly homemade and the sauce was good but feel like it was more a good on you for effort than execution.  By far the star of the show was my main, McBeastwhich or however they spell it. Fried chicken thigh meat (dark meat is key) on a biscuit with white gravy. OMG so delicous! Salty, fried, chicken goodness, buttery, soft biscuit and gravy... what's not to love??  The fried egg on the side was a bit odd, it kinda felt like it was put their to make it a \"brunch\" menu item. They didn't even ask me how I'd like the egg but maybe because we were a larger party.  I tried a few other mains, the french toast was pretty good, the southern hash, smoked trout falafel benny, and breakfast tostada were all well received though i didn't try them. the labatt 50 was a bit of a disappointment, mostly because the bacon lacked flavour and mostly tasted like salt. And the breakfast sandwhich was also a disappointment though I didn't try it.   I guess overall I'd say 4 stars for effort, they definitely try to be innovative with their menu. But maybe 3.5 stars for execution."}
{"text":"Venue: Beast Restaurant Dinning Experience: Dinner Specialty: Canadian-Fusion Menu items: Smoked Mackerel, Grilled Octopus, Rainbow Trout Gravlax & Wild Boar Loin  Just shy of one \"a\" on his last name, Chef and restauranteur Scott Vivian of Beast could be considered my \"compadre\". Yet this pseudo compadre prides himself on bringing what he calls \"Ontario Soul Food\" to a city that longs for setting a higher bar in the food scene, as he more or less explained to Anthony Bourdain during a Toronto Layover episode.  Beast is the 4 year-old post by the Vivians. A restaurant that features nose-to-tail and farm-to-fork meals in a nonchalant way. The venue itself is decorated with intriguing art pieces that would make you second guess your meal, hopefully in a good way. The wooden tables and chairs are small and have a rusty look to them.  The menu is contentious with unapologetic descriptions that are meant to test your waiter's knowledge of the food. Items are meant to be shared and though they don't claim to be a \"tapas\" restaurant, they certainly make it a point to serve extremely small plates. Service is once again nonchalant, but nonetheless cordial.  The Smoked Mackerel is a 4 bite plate that comes served with rosti; in other words potatoe hash in the shape of a triangle. The smokiness of the fish is defiant, strong and tasty. The smoked fish sits on a bed of house-made sour cream and is topped with dill. Combining all ingredients into one bite is the perfect way to enjoy this dish.  The Rainbow Trout Gravlax is good but the least favourite from the menu items. Unfortunately the taste of the trout alone meant nothing, unless mixed with the outstanding kobeyaki vinagrette that was beautifully smothered all over the plate with sesame oil.  On the other hand, the Grilled Octopus stood out on it's own with or without the romesco sauce in which it sat. The tentacled squid was perfectly grilled and seasoned. Accompanied by roasted potatoes and pickled quail eggs, this dish hit all marks when it came to taste, seasoning and combination of ingredients.  The expertly cooked Wild Boar Loin sat on a bed of grilled cauliflower, topped with what potentially tasted like a sour plum sauce. The loin was tender and rich with a semi-burnt layer that allowed for the juiciness of the meat to be contained. The grilled cauliflowers were a perfect accompaniment to the dish balancing out the strong taste of the meat.  Foodie Tip: Head to Beast with an open mind but not an open stomach. The dishes are rather small and prices are steep, but they are definitely worth a try.   Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Menu constantly changes so you'll find some really cool, different dishes with flavors from all over. Everyone raves about the brunch, which I must try but the dinner is AMAZING. You can't go wrong with any dish. Lamb ribs, mussels, pappardelle, and the homemade rolls!!! Great for a quiet night out or a feast!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations and was let down a little.  I was here for brunch and the service was great as well as the vibe.  I had the pemeal bacon sandwich that looked great, but didn't taste the best.  The taste was all pork, and I couldn't taste the egg or anything else that was in this sandwich.  The home made donuts were amazing.  I will go back and try a different brunch item in hopes of rating Beast at least a 4 star."}
{"text":"Meat! And lots of it!  Remember to come to Beast early. Brunch would be ideal to have at 11:30, but if you come at that time, you will have to wait a LONG TIME to be seated. My party of two arrived at 10:09am and had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. It's that popular.  Speaking of the food, you really can't go wrong with anything in the menu (unless you happen to be vegetarian/vegan). Make sure to try the Beast Bacon and get the Challah if you get the choice! Those were the stand-outs of my meal.  If I can get myself out of bed on a Saturday early enough, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend found this place on yelp with good reviews so we decided to give this place a try. We didn't make reservation ahead of time, good thing when we got there, we were able to get the last free table, so we didn't have to wait. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I got the beastwich plus an egg. The sandwich itself was so flavorful, and I like the way they made their chicken, it was crispy and nice. The biscuit was also moist. We also ordered three appetizers to share between another couple. We got the fried mussels, pork hock, and the poutine. The poutine was really interesting, I never tasted something like this before. We're visiting from NY, so wanted to try some real Canadian food. There were gnocchi in it with a bit of chicken parm taste, interesting for me. The pork hock was really good, tasted like fried Korean chicken wings lol I loved it. The mussels tasted normal in my opinion. This store is hidden in residential area, kinda hard to find, but it's a hidden gem, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Beast is located at 96 Tecumseth Street in downtown Toronto.  This is a house-converted restaurant with some pretty neat wall art. A Rooster man nude with a leaf to obscure his junk.  On the other side there is Deer woman laying pronated on it's belly.  Three water receptacles for our group facilitated convenient  thirst satiation. Waitress eventually came & took our orders.  While waiting for our actual food we got some hard bread with poppy seeds, & something similar to brioche & some very soft butter.  Several dishes ordered to share:  Duck Hearts - served on skewers with olives & eggs.  Farinata - speckled trout served on flat bread of some sort.  It also had radish, pesto, & goat cheese.  Fried Chicken Livers- served with fennel, beet root, & ranch dressing   Poutine - made with gnocchi, wild boar & creme fraiche.  Charcuterie - pork terrine, foie gras, elk rissolo, wild boar mortadella & duck prosciutto.  Sweetbreads - served on a bed of collard greens  Beast offers food that is very tasty, savory & different in the sense that other eateries do not offer wild creatures on their menu.  Service less than impressive as food made it's way to the table at a lazy pace."}
{"text":"A small restaurant tucked away on King st but its one of the most cozy and rustic places Toronto has to offer! Its a small restaurant that likely seats no more than 30 people. It seems like you're over at a big family gathering waiting for the delicious meal that you are sure to get.  I came here for brunch at 10 am and there was already a line up waiting outside! and Beast wasn't even open yet! So after a good few minutes in the cold we finally managed to get in and it was definitely worth the wait!  I ordered their daily special in house made donuts, the maple bacon and bailey dip donuts which were delicious! But the highlight of the meal was the Beastwich!   A crispy fried boneless chicken thigh sandwiched between a butter biscuit, a fried egg, covered in sausage gravy and a side of home fries. This place gives Stockyard a run for its money!   Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a rustic brunch spot! But get here early, the line only got worse!"}
{"text":"Strolled into beast on a Saturday for brunch. The wait wasn't too bad.  I ordered the Beastwhich and the duck confit French toast to share.  The fried chicken was crispy and moist on the inside. It's so yummy! Highly recommended.  The creme fraiche of the French toast and the cranberry sauce complemented the salty duck so well. Only complaint is that there wasn't enough duck.  Sam James cut coffee came in a cute French press. I was given a timer to pour the coffee myself. It's a little gimmicky for me and the coffee was too watered down.  The highly raved about maple bacon donuts were unfortunately sold out so I definitely want to come back to try that out."}
{"text":"I really was wanting to try this place, especially after Bourdain came here. First, the beer menu. I looked online to see what they had, was happily surprised to see a few I had never tried but when I got there, nadda. Sold out. Regardless, their beer selection is a fair assortment of Ontario craft brews. Not a big selection, but a few.  Secondly, this is a tapas place, so it's better to come with a few people to try a few things. Here's what I tried:  0. Free bread - The hot loaf is very good. The one that has ends, not as great.  1. Fried Pickles - I've spent a lot of time in the South (read: South USA) and had a lot of fried pickles. These ones were cut thinly then fried. Many of them have a hole in the middle, not sure if it's cause the middle of the pickle melted away or they cored it. Anyways, I felt it'd be slightly better if they cut it just a tad thicker to get a better pickle flavor rather than just the fried-ness.  2. Zuchinni - This one had a lot of ingredients and was advertised as an explosion of flavor. I felt it was a little tough to eat because all the pieces were distinct and there wasn't anything to hold it together, and given a zuchinni isn't very stiff, you sometimes can't pick it all up.  3. Gnocchi Poutine - I quite liked this, though was expecting a few more gnocchi. Though for the price it's probably fair. The duck was generous, the gnocchi tasted like fried cheese. What I'd want out of the gnocchi poutine.  4. Brussel Sprouts - This was by far the best dish. The tahini on top was a nice addition to the already fried sprouts  5. rock crab and fregola - So fregola is this pasta that is basically pasta balls, very small balls. This was pretty good, a decent dish with some substance  6. The clams - the clams were kinda small, the sauce was decent. Wasn't anything to write home about  7.  Dirty rice balls - I'm still not sure what this is besides rice. Another pass.  8. Crispy pig ears - This is kinda like chips, but made of pig ears. It's pretty good for chips.  9. sticky toffee pudding - quite good and a lot of sticky toffee. It's sweet, but not like Indian dessert sweet.  10. Apple pot pie - a little hallow in my opinion, needs more apple.  The service though was great, the waiter was attentive enough, was so helpful with the food. And his enthusiasm to it really made me look forward to the food.  The ambiance was really cool though, located on a side street. It really has the feel of off the beaten path, even though it's downtown."}
{"text":"This review is only for their brunch menu.   Beast has definitely one of the best brunches in Toronto. I have been here several times, and was never disappointed. The must try item is their BEASTWICH - Fried chicken sandwiched between a biscuit, topped with a fried egg and smothered  in their housemade gravy, served with potatoes. It tastes so good we would drive downtown just for that. Their smoked trout eggs benedict is also very good. I would have never thought that smoked trout with eggs benny would taste good. But somehow the chefs at BEAST made it happen. I love this place and I would recommened it to everyone. It is quite small though, and they do not take reservations for brunch, so you better come early or expect to wait!"}
{"text":"Wait was over an hour for food (table of two)...they were very busy and kitchen is small so wasn't overly upset by this. However, when food finally came out it was warm, over cooked bacon, over cooked eggs. Disappointing. Server never came over to check on us or our food during the overall hour and a half experience. Place has tons of potential, needs improvement in service and ability to handle brunch rush."}
{"text":"Small brunch place in a quiet residential area, which is always a big plus in my book.  The wait at 12:30pm took about 30-35 minutes but they have benches around the corner to sit and soak up the sun while we wait.  Rachelle's Donuts -- we tried the coconut and chocolate ones.  While they were both flaky and soft, I liked the chocolate donut better.  They had already ran out of their famous maple bacon donuts.  Colombia Coffee -- arrived in a French Press with a timer, was very watery and weak, couldn't finish it  Labatt 50 breakfast -- pork belly with sunny side up eggs on toast and mixed greens.  Mediocre dish.  My friends got the Huevos Rancheros and chicken thigh sandwich (I forgot if it was beastwich or chicken club), which didn't look very appetizing either.  Service was great but food was just okay."}
{"text":"Brunch at Beast is Bomb.  Service was very friendly and attentive. We had our choice to sit inside or outdoors. If you sit inside, check out their beast-body artwork.  I had the:  --Dirty Rice Balls: Arancini made with pork, chicken liver and chicken broth. The outer layer was perfectly crisp and the interior rice and meat was so flavorful. It was crazy good with diablo's fuego hot sauce.  --Challah French Toast: Perfectly savory and sweet. The salty duck confit with the sweet whipped cream fraiche and the maple syrup was delicious. The challah toast was fluffy and the cranberry mostarda added extra sweetness and some tartness.   We took some of Rachelle's donuts to-go including the Maple-Bacon and Peanut Butter. Good donuts and my fav was the Peanut Butter."}
{"text":"Went here to dinner on a Saturday night. The place is small and packed by 7pm. If you are going with a group of people you need to make an early reservation. Food is served tapas style. You have an option of ordering a la carte or for $45 dollars each person the chef will cook you a sample of everything from the menu. Atmosphere is great. Very laid back. Great for group dinners.   As for food, most of it are very good and if you are an adventurous eater then all the better! They serve fried pig ears, bison tongue, crispy pork hocks and grilled sweetbreads  Some of the items on the menu that I love are the following: 1. Fried pickled with ranch dressing 2. fried gnocchi with braised beef (poutine!) 3. rainbow trout 4. Mackerel with artichokes  Also had an apple crumble dessert but this one has a kick to end as they made the apple pie a bit spicy and paired it with vanilla ice cream.   Overall, it was a good dining experience. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"This is a small cafe in a residential neighborhood; very charming. The food is excellent and the service is good too. We had the beastwich (definitely recommend splitting it with someone) and the sticky toffee pudding. The beastwich is as good as it sounds, and we highly recommend it. The dessert was probably the best dessert my husband and I have ever had! Ever. We are fifty years old, and have had a lot of desserts. Next time we are in town, we will be back. The only negative is that you have to walk through the tiny kitchen to get to the bathroom. That just doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"Heads up - there is no 120 happy hour during the winter... I had to learn the hard way by finding out at the restaurant, no biggie. I thought that this place was getting a lot of hype with an always changing menu so I booked a 530 reservation just in case.. But walked into an empty restaurant on a Friday afternoon. Situated in a small house, the dim lighting and music created a nice ambiance.  The place smelled like it had been cooking up a storm and my mouth was watering but I was only here to grab a drink and a small bite.  Not really a wine conniseure, I was in the mood for a glass of rose, and picked the only one that sold by the glass... It was called kasava.. I think... But it was described as it tasting like a rhubarb pie. Well I have to say that it was one of the best roses I have ever had. It was just the perfect amount of sweetness with a touch of tart...I loved every sip of it.  We were offered fresh bread, made in house but I could be wrong, with jalapeño butter..definitely added a nice kick to each bite.  My friend and I shared the sweet potato wedges that came with pecans and a maple sherry vinegrette. I wasn't sure if these were going to be fries, cut in thicker slices, but it came out similar to a huge sweet potato cut up into huge chunks. It was full of potato, not deep fried, I don't think, and coated nicely with the vinegrette. For 10 dollars it was a decent size and good for sharing.  I have to say that by the time we left around 7 the place was pretty much full. For one drink and one apple, it was almost 20 dollars so I thought it was a little pricey. However, I would definitely come back just to try the other plates and see what other new inventions they have in store."}
{"text":"Came here bright and early on a Sunday morning for brunch. They open at 10 am - we arrived at 9:50 am and there were already several groups waiting for the restaurant to open. Note that there are no reservations for brunch - first come, first serve only.  We started with the donuts ($5 for 2 full-sized donuts!) and they were absolutely delicious. They had about 6 flavours to choose from - we got the creamsicle and the brown-butter hazelnut to share. The donuts were soft and squishy with a slight chew to them. The creamsicle had a cream cheese icing with orange drizzle on top, and the brown-butter hazelnut was reminiscent of Ferrero Rocher (minus the chocolate). They were so yummy we even got some to-go.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo ($14). The chorizo was worth the extra $3. I opted for half home fried potatoes and half mixed green salad (with is served with a zingy lemongrass vinaigrette). Portions were quite good, and I was so stuffed at the end that I didn't even have space left for dessert!   They serve coffee in individual French Press with a timer, which was cute. I got a tea ($3, from David's Tea), which came in a generous size pot (good for about 4 cups of tea) but I don't think they added enough tea leaves to the bag, as it was quite weak even after steeping for a long time. Service was also slow - took about 1 hour for our mains to arrive, despite being the third table seated after the restaurant opened.  Would still come back because the food was fantastic and well-priced."}
{"text":"Very interesting place with great ambience and unique design. I didn't like the food much, though. I think it was very heavy and salty. My bf on the other hand loved it. So my review is gonna be from both of us. We did their tasting menu that included various meats and seafood dishes. His top choice was the fish, and mine was gnocchi. The service was pretty fast. The bill came up to a 100 per person.   Food me 2 stars/my bf 5 stars Service both 5 stars Ambience both 5stars Pricing 3 stars"}
{"text":"Now what trip wouldn't be complete with trying a restaurant that Anthony Bourdain mentions himself. Beast is located in a quite part of the Toronto neighbor. From the outside it almost looks like a coffee shop and on the inside looks like a coffee shop.  Our server was really nice and service was excellent. The food is unique with an Asian flair. All meant to be shared. We started with some appetizers and several courses with lots of the house cocktails which were quite good. Everything that came out was delicious and well flavored. The pork hock was a table favorite and dessert was the  sticky toffee pudding.  Another memorable meal and memorial trip. Thanks Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner finally, after wanting to for ages.  They have a cinq-a-sept menu which is really reasonably priced - everything $5. So, we started with oysters, crab cakes, and cava.   But the real treat is the meat.   They had lamb belly on the menu, which I was keen to try, never having seen it offered before. Terrific mix of flavours, rich and delicious. Also had the swordfish crudo with rhubarb foam, which was amazing. It is \"sustainably sourced,\" and we were joking amongst ourselves that maybe someone went out with an epée to take the swordfish on in a fencing match - almost correct, they are actually caught by spear-fishers!   The fried gnocchi poutine is also phenomenal. People should fry gnocchi all the time.  Didn't end up having dessert, too full after dinner! Which is really how it should be."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Toronto!   Fried chicken and biscuits are all you need in life. The main entree menu is a variety of fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches. I tried the Beastwich and the Bruce Leroy, both sandwiches were delicious but I think the Beastwich was just a bit better. The only problem with the Bruce Leroy was the kimchi, it was a bit saltier and more soy based than usual kimchi.   For appetizers, I sampled the pork hocks, fried mussels and chicken park poutine. All three were as amazing as I expected. Looking forward to trying the other appetizers and sandwiches on my next Toronto trip."}
{"text":"The word \"beast\" when it comes to food paints a very carnivorous image in my mind. It's raw, substantial, meaty, intense and perhaps even barbaric; words that best describes this place. You don't come here for fruits, salads, croissants and mini-cupcakes for breakfast. You come here for a post battle feast!   Fried chicken on buttery biscuits for breakfast? Check. Duck confit on Challah french toast?  Check and check. Maple glaze bacon doughnuts and sticky toffee pudding? Sure! Go ahead, have all that and wash it down with a great cup of joe from sir Sam James.  So yeah, come hungry like a pack of wolfs on a hunger strike. You deserve this one because you've just endured a grueling 8 hours of fasting the night before."}
{"text":"You'd never know this place was here. Just off King & Bathurst. As you walk about the residential street you wonder how there could be a restaurant nestled among the row houses. But sure enough it's there. The Beast. Lying in wait for you.  It's a small place. An intimate restaurant for meat lovers. There might be only one vegetarian friendly item on the menu but I'm sure it's so infused with meat fumes from the kitchen that you'd have to turn your head sideways and unfocus your eyes (how come we even have that ability?) to maintain the fiction you're staying true to your vegan (or whatever plant only eaters the hell call themselves these days) roots.  For such a small place they seem to have about 3 servers working the floor. Maybe we came on some casual friday but the servers are dressed like software workers. Jeans, golf shirts. I'd have liked to see a bit more of the white linen in terms of attire.  Service was slow but maybe that's part of the atmosphere. I don't know how long it takes to prepare bone marrow. The menu makes no distinction between appetizers and mains. Portion size is not apparent. You have to sort of go on pricing. Anything under about $16 is app. Anything $16+ is main. They seem to encourage you to buy a few dishes. I would concur. You might want to try 3 dishes per two people and share unless you're getting the burger.  The burger. Oh dear. It's like something out of The Homer J Simpsons Cookbook. An all beef patty layered with bacon, a fried egg, rich creamery butter... etc. It's a delicious albeit fully messy and sloppy bit of work. Bring your own wet naps. And watch where your tie dangles. If the burger was a little bigger I'd be back every Friday for one. Then again, maybe I'm looking in the wrong dimension. The thing is stacked high. Think luxury condo building, not plastic cookie cutter detached suburban home. The hush puppies side and bread starter were awesome.  Bathrooms seem to be unisex although they're pretty cool. Take either the alien woman bathroom or the attack of the 50 foot woman bathroom (gravity makes it impossible to simply scale up the human skeleton to 50 feet...your bones would break).   So what do we got? We got a funky ass place you can take your meat lover clan and they'll think you're some kind of genius in tune with the Toronto restaurant scene and know these little out of the way places. The food is flavorful. Pricing is not out of line with better dining in Toronto."}
{"text":"Previous review noted donuts made by Dough by Rachelle at Beast restaurant. Someone new is making the donuts there now, and they are not nearly as good. My original review mentioned Rachelle's cake donuts. The new donuts are raised only, very greasy, very poor texture. They rely heavily on glazes and gimmicks - the glazes are also very heavy. I'm not a fan. Dough by Rachelle, where are you?! So I guess Beast is still good for brunch, but sadly, not for donuts."}
{"text":"This place was on my list for for awhile. I ended up going on a very cold Wednesday night. I was very surprised when Google said \"You have arrived at your destination\". Beast is located on a street that I will never know how to pronounce, the closest intersection is King St and Tecumseth.   It is a very small restaurant, with a very very small kitchen. I sat down with a friend aka my soulmate and foodie partner Bubbles (my favorite person to eat with) and we already knew what we wanted.   We ordered the Fried Gnocchi Poutine, The Beastwich: fried chicken thigh, pimento cheese, pork sausage gravy and dessert which was some sort of Toffee Bread Pudding.   We told the server that we were hungry but she still suggested just one sandwich to split. If you eat like myself and my friend, please do yourself a favor and order one each.   The Fried Gnocci Poutine was interesting, I liked the Fried Gnocci aspect, but I didn't like the sauce. That evening it was a curry based sauce (not a fan of curry). It also wasn't what we expected, Poutine is supposed to be cheesy and covered in hot gravy. I gotta give the chef some points for creativity.   Next up, our Beastwich arrived. It was very small. Looking back now, the Chef should use a larger biscuit. We cut the sandwich in half but couldn't pick it up. The biscuit was falling apart. The fried chicken is MASSIVE, very  very crispy. I wish it had more flavor though.   Finally dessert! It was SO sweet, and we asked the waitress who explained how it was made with butter and caramel. It was like eating a bowl of melted werthers. Was way too sweet for our liking.   The service was great and I would come back for maybe brunch.  Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"This bad boy is worth the wait.  We got there just past noon-time and we didn't get seated and get our food until 1:30pm.  That said, we were dying of hunger, but Beast did not disappoint.    I got the beastwhich with salad and potatoes on the side.  I wish I got just the salad, not to say that the potato wasn't good.  In fact, it was one of the best I've ever had.  It was somewhat crunchy outside and packed in flavour.  I just wish I got the salad because it's a good break from all that fried chicken, gravy and biscuit.  Also, the dressing is unforgettable!  It had a kick of ginger, perhaps?  I'm not really good at figuring out what is what, but it reminded me of the dressing you get with your complimentary salad on Japanese restaurants, but tastier.    As for the beastwhich itself, everything about it was perfect!  The biscuit is well done, soft and tasty.  The gravy wasn't too much that it was overpowering and the chicken, one of the best I've ever had.  It was still juicy, very tender and oh em gee, so good!  The only thing I'd say is to have a small snack on your way here so you're not starving, waiting for the table.  Aside from that, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Beast was a great idea, and served great food, when it first opened. Now, it seems like success has made the over confident restaurant let down their guard, serving the same food, but with less regard and concern for quality. Guacamole must be served fresh, and it wasn't... instead, anyone with a palate can easily detect the looming taste of sourness before it goes bad. Same can be said about the spicy chourizo - it was clearly at, or past, it's shelf life. The house-made ginger beer was also suffering from the same fate. Folks, if it isn't fresh, don't serve it at all, or you risk further damage to what might have been more success. Also, seating guests should be more deserving than a simple finger point towards an available table, once it has been cleared and wiped. Lastly, if you proudly serve fresh-squeezed fruit juices, running out on a weekend is never a good thing. Come people, bring back the Beast, and step up your game, before it's too late."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to visit Beast for at least 2 years now and for some reason it didn't happen until Sunday, and boy, I regret not coming here frequently in the past. Beast is located on the side streets of a nice little neighborhood between Queen + King, has convenient street parking, and the building itself looks pretty cool both inside and outside. The place itself is a decent size and features some of the best art I have ever seen in my life (naked humans with chicken heads and feet, weird, I know). I came here with a group of five and after a 15 minute wait we were seated and ready to order soon after. I ended up ordering the Beastwich which consist of fried chicken, pimento cheese, a fried egg, and pork sausage gravy and served with some of the tastiest potatoes I've had in recent memory. This sandwich was so much more then what I could have imagined, this may of been the single best Sandwich I have had in my 28 years of life. The chicken was tender, the gravy was hot and absolutely everywhere, and even the rolls used were cooked to perfection. My friends and I all left full and super satisfied. This one trip has officially added Beast to my Top 10 of Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm really on the fence between 3 and 4 here.   This place is quite inconspicuous as it is nestled in a quiet neighborhood and almost looks like it was another cookie cutter house of its own. We had drinks and food on their outside patio area on a summer day which was enjoyable.   Me and my girlfriend were visiting Toronto and trying to hit up a really good happy hour. The beast seemed to fit the bill with 5 dollar drinks and food specials along with 1 dollar oysters.   Food:  The oysters were prince Edward varietal and quite tasty. Great balance without too much meatiness or brinyness.   We also had the maple glazed pork belly which was unremarkable. Pork belly wasn't quite as tender and rich as I'd hoped pork belly to normally be.   We also had this thing called the doubled which was kind of like a bready macaron looking thing with a curry substance. I thought this was quite good.   Drinks:  The house cocktail they had that day was pimms cup which was basically some sort of herbal gin mixed with Lemonade. Needless to say they are a little stingy on their alcohol. Tasted more like juice than anything.   The beer I had was a Hawaiian style pale ale by spearhead brewing which I quite enjoyed.   Overall, I thought the experience was good but hit or miss. So I'm going to give them benefit of the doubt  with a 3.5 but round up to 4 since I didn't actually try their full entrees/tapas. Will probably stop by just for oysters and beer next time if I'm in the neighborhood! Happy yelping!"}
{"text":"Lovely little patio just south of Queen street with a great happy hour till 7.  A group of 4 of us feasted decadently.  Oddly, if I have one complaint, it's a bit too decadent ... all sorts of delicious, rich / fatty small plates, tons of fine cuts of meat ... but some simple vegetable / bread options would diminish the sensory overload a bit (they do have bread ... cheesy, decadent bread).     They might actually win friends with salad.    Glad we sat on the patio though ... our initial table (reserved well in advance) was really, really cramped.  Like, nowhere to put a bag, difficulty getting up to go to the washroom cramped."}
{"text":"FOOD Pork terrine - Flavourful and nicely spiced. It came with a teeny bit of pickled watermelon rind, which just tasted like sugar to me. My dining companions all agreed this was their favourite dish.  Pigeon - This dish was all right. I found that the flavours were imbalanced; too much seasoning and not enough pigeon flavour.  Gnocchi - Great texture! However, it tasted like a tomato stew...a *really good* stew, but still, a stew.  AMBIANCE The place is small and cozy, with dark brown/mahogany and white design  palette. I felt comfortable there.   SERVICE Really nice service here. Nothing to complain about! The server ws patient and attentive.  ACCESSIBILITY The entrance of this restaurant is not wheelchair-accessible.  THEIR TWO REDEEMING QUALITIES Really, I thought one of the two redeeming qualities about this place is their surprisingly cheap alcohol from Wednesday to Friday, between 5pm and 7pm. Four dollars for a steamwhistle! Five dollars for a glass of house wine!  The second redeeming quality is the warm, buttery, complimentary housemade bread. They are good to look at (so aesthetically pleasing!) and delicious to the palette! We couldn't get enough of their jalapeno butter either.  Note to self: Go back and try their tasting menu. Have a feeling it's going to go over much better."}
{"text":"ok so double check the hours... because the first time i came it was closed.  total waste of an uber.  when i did get there though the food was delicious!  the serving sizes are pretty generous, but share if theres a ton of things you want to try."}
{"text":"Lots of flavor packed into everything! They served us complimentary bread and butter and the two of us ordered the pork hock, gnocchi poutine, and the trout. That was enough to fill us up! Our favorite is the pork hock dish. The sweet and salty of the pork on top of mildly spicy and sour kimchi was amazing.  The chocolate marquise for dessert, served with candied hazelnuts, blueberry compote, and Madeline cookie was such a rich yet refreshing dessert. We licked the plate clean.  What we appreciated was that the waiter made recommendations based on his own favourites, not the prices. Nice place for date night. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had the fried gnocchi poutine, pork hocks, rainbow trout, and lamb ribs. ALL SO AMAZING. The ribs and pork melt in your mouth. And topping off the meal with sticky toffee pudding is a great finish. I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had desert here after a sushi date, and I have to say that, no contest, the desert takes it hands down!  Got the chocolate lava cake...or whatever it's called. It was out of this world awesome.  Great service too. I need to come back for the food. I've heard it's equally off the hook!"}
{"text":"I struggled between a 3-star and a 4-star review for this place.  My husband and I decided to try The Beast for brunch on a Saturday AM; we found it by typing in \"brunch\" on the maps function of my iPhone and seeing what was nearby.  Incidentally, when we got there we had realized that we had walked by this place in the past and thought it looked like a cool spot to check out.  The restaurant itself is everything we could have asked for in a weekend brunch spot.  It appears to be converted from an old house, and has a \"hipster\" vibe with - if I recall correctly - mismatched chairs and unique art on the walls.  The service was a bit slow, but good.  Unfortunately, the food - although it sounded as though it was going to be amazing based on the menu descriptions - was just so-so.  I had the vegetable scramble of the day, which included brussels sprouts, emmental cheese, and a savory aioli.  My husband had the pollo loco.  Good quality ingredients, but both of us found the food to be quite bland, with the potatoes having the most flavour.  Nothing I couldn't have easily made at home.  The coffee (we had decaf) was very nice, though we couldn't really taste the \"s'mores\" flavour promised to us in the menu.  But not a big deal, still good coffee.  All in all, we really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately probably won't be going back due to the blandness of the food."}
{"text":"Man, this place is popular for being a hidden restaurant located in a cute residential neighborhood. We arrived at 11AM and waited an hour to be seated; they didn't take reservations. There was outside seating (dog friendly but no shade though); we preferred sitting inside.  For food, the Beastwich (fried chicken with sausage gravy biscuit sandwich) was crave-worthy... as in I'm craving it right now at 8AM. It's very heavy though so you might want to eat only salads for the rest of the day or run a marathon after... Also tried the duck confit French toast and the donuts (strawberry chocolate and blueberry), not as memorable as the sandwich, but not bad choices if you're craving for sweets. I love that they offer David's Tea on the menu - try the vanilla earl grey!  Next time, arrive at 10AM opening time to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"Great service and food. We had pigs ears, lamb poutine, and biscuits with gravy. Recommend all!"}
{"text":"Top notch service and great food! The asparagus with the hummus was to die for! Prices were within reason and the atmosphere is perfect either for a group of friends out or a casual romantic setting. The restaurant is situated on a small local street and quite hidden - so the crowd tends to be a bit more local and the patio is relatively quiet. Would definitely recommend to friends looking for quality comfort food! Only reason Beast gets 4/5 stars is because the elk tartare had a strong taste of horseradish that neither my date nor I were prepared for - buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Great food lovely service, great place for brunch or a date. Try their home made Sauces and fries. It's mouth watering to see even better in taste."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, I had to come by for Sunday brunch.  Who doesn't love a mimosa that actually tastes like champagne.  If you're trying this place for the first time, please do yourself a favor and order the beastwich. This will not disappoint at all!"}
{"text":"Oh no... I'm going to be one of the first to give this place a bad review ;o(  Came here at 1pm and wait time was an hour for two people. Even if there was no wait time, I would not come back here. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but everyone else raved about it on Yelp.  THE BEASTWICH - Deep fried chicken thigh was 90% soggy with only the edges being crispy. The meat was tender, but not very flavorful.  - Biscuit is ok. It's light and crispy at the top, but generally lacked the flavor I like in a biscuit (i.e. butter and salt). If you want an awesome biscuit breakfast sandwich, go to Lazy Daisy's Cafe on Gerrard instead). - Fried egg is key!  - Pimento Cheese sauce was ok. - Potatoes were crispy, but tasted like they've been sitting around for awhile... lacked flavor in the inner potato part. If you want good potatoes, go to Insomnia on Bathurst and Bloor. - Mixed Salad had a nice ginger dressing, which I'm not usually a fan of, but it worked well.   PORK BELLY SIDE - Overcooked, tough and dry.   CHORIZO SAUSAGE SIDE - Tasted like it should.  We were in the last round of brunch seating, so maybe the kitchen staff were exhausted from a busy day of endless customers... but our meal just completely missed the mark ;o( Oh and our clothes smelled like deep fried oil afterwards as well. Boo."}
{"text":"Stopped in Toronto just for the day  Stopped here for brunch on Sunday.  Started with the fried pickles thin sliced and very lightly deep fried. Had a local sparkling wine that was quite good. I had the beastwich very good not too big but rich and tasty. The dressing on the salad is a ginger vinegar based yummyness. I would love to make it at home it was that good."}
{"text":"I, like Alex R., was there on Saturday, and had to suffer the longer than usual wait while the restaurant held a table for 10 for more than 30 minutes. The sign outside the restaurant clearly states that it will not hold a table for more than 15 minutes, and will not let others join the table later. They broke their rule for 'mentors' of the owner, who clearly did not have the respect for him/her to follow the house rules that other customers are forced to follow by showing up on time. Nothing was offered to us in compensation for the longer than usual wait or for forcing us to wait outside. The food was great, but doesn't make up for the shabby way I and the other many customers commiserating with us outside were treated. All of us vowed never to return."}
{"text":"[TLDR: It needs to dream a little bigger, but it is worth a try.]  The Beast's grasp is strong ... but it could use more reach.  This is a fine restaurant by any conventional measure, but as a place with obviously high aspirations, Beast needs to push a little -- suffering more in imagination than in execution.  Many restaurants suffer from overdesign, but here many of the dishes could actually use a few more flourishes, a little more dexterity, a few more strong flavours.  The \"snacks,\" including dirty rice balls, homefried BBQ chips with blue cheese dip, and potato wedges were satisfying, but, with the exception of the perfectly executed deep fried pickle slices, pretty pedestrian.  As for the mains, the veggie dishes were the highlight.  Deep frying the brussel sprouts gave them an almost nori-like crispiness.  The beet(root) with fennel, dill, and feta was excellent -- beets & dill always a winning combination as far as I'm concerned.  The mushrooms on toast were infused with a distinct and very pleasant hot chocolate aroma.  Given they're ostensibly the main attraction here, I was disappointed with the meat dishes.  The poutine was unstructured.  Each ingredient was good, but the combination didn't constitute any kind of riff on the idea of poutine, nor was there any standout piquant flavour.  I could barely taste the paprika in the bone marrow, although it was nice with a little fragment of flat-leaf parsley.  The crispy lamb ribs -- really just cubes of crisped strands of lamb -- were tasty.  I liked the salsa verde, although it was really more of a mint chimichurri.  With a bit of anchovy and a sharp of grapefruit, it was quite a nice little bite.  The pastrami sandwich was a pastrami sandwich.  I have to suspend comment on the sticky toffee pudding because it's pretty hard for me to be objective about a deep bowl of molten caramel :)  Nice wine list.  I enjoyed the Stratus Tollhouse Red.  The french press coffees were good too.  Service excellent.  Nice roomy space (tables a little worn), decent decor -- the psychedelic reclining-rooster-as-Bacchus and dreaming cow/calf paintings are bound to polarize your party as much as they did mine."}
{"text":"Good brunch place. Coffee is amazing.   Menu is minimal which is good. Recommend the Beastwich -- mixed veggies and potatoes are a good compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain made me come here!  My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and there was no line up at 11:30am, we got seated right away. After 10 minutes i noticed a huge line up at the door already.   MAPLE BACON DONUTS were SOLD OUT by this time!! so come early if you want them!  I ordered the challah french toast and the boyfriend ordered the beastwich. My challah french toast is topped with duck confit, cranberry 'mostarda' (looks like a cranberry compote to me), whipped creme fraiche with a side of maple syrup. Everything about this dish works! The portion size is very generous but if your super hungry then this will fulfill you!   The beastwich was one of a kind, my boyfriend loved it so much! I thought i wouldn't like it due to its over abundance in gravy but when i took a bite, i didn't mind at all! It's buttermilk biscuit, fried chicken, cheese, pork sausage gravy with a fried egg on top! served with house potatoes. This will have you crawling back to bed on a Sunday afternoon.  Overall this place was great! I also recommend trying their teas, they have a bunch of variety I've never heard of."}
{"text":"My friend Bourdain told me to come here when I visit Toronto. Well, he didn't tell me directly but I obeyed.  Friendly staff, great food. We had the bone marrow, the mad maple and the beast sandwich. The poutine was our absolute favorite. The ambience is very chill and intimate. Great for couples, girls night out, family, individuals. Anyways, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"After making my way here for the second time, I'm sold. What a great little brunch spot.   Coffee is Sam James and each serving comes with it's very own French Press and timer for the perfect pour. Donuts (Rachelle's donuts @doughtoronto) - must try the donuts! We split two for $5 between three of us - maple bacon and key lime pie. Both super tasty.  Last time I had the super decadent challah french toast (topped w/duck confit), this time I went for the Beastwich (fried chicken on a buttermilk biscuit) which comes with potatoes (perfectly fried) and salad. Both options are winners.   Be there when it opens to ensure a dining spot. Like most places in Toronto if your party isn't on time you'll be on a bench outside waiting."}
{"text":"The food was good but is not worth the price , especially the portions served. You pay a price of a full meal but they give you appetizer dishes. $80 later and you're still hungry.  The servant was very rude annoyed and unhappy for whatever reason."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for Brunch. We arrived right before they opened so were able to get a table right away but there was already a line up behind us  Coffee - 5 Stars Food - 3 Stars  The coffee arrives in your personal French Press which adds a unique touch. There are a few different types of coffee to choose from, and they are explained to you by flavor profile. We both ordered a different one, and they were aromatic, rich, and full of flavor. I would come back just for the coffee, it was delicious.  I had the special meat scramble of the day and I was not a fan. I think it had some tendons or something in it but it had a chewy taste and the sauce added a weird flavor to the dish. I would try something else next time.  Overall, a cool place and I would come back"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday morning within 15 mins of the place opening and it was already hopping! We were luckily able to be seated right away.  We started with coffee and doughnuts. I had the Ethiopian coffee, which was amazing with notes of peach and that big fruity flavour I love in African coffees. They bring it to you in a little single-serving French press that you get to plunge yourself when a timer goes off. For doughnuts, we tried the maple bacon and cinnamon sugar twist. Both were incredible. The doughnuts sell out fast, so be sure to order them right away!  We followed that up with some of their fried gnocchi poutine. The flavour of the day was wild boar with chickpea curry. SO GOOD. Easily my favourite dish of the meal. Their use of gnocchi to replace the traditional fries is spot on, and the boar curry topping was so delish! Would love to order the poutine again and see what other interesting flavours they'll whip up.  For my main dish, I got the challah French toast. It features duck confit, which is why I sprang for it. It is a really decent French toast, but the French toast I had the day prior at Bareburger was superior to this. My friend got the other dish I was debating on, their smoked trout benedict. I got to sample it and it was delicious! (I am a sucker for smoked trout though.) I love the fact that they have this alternative to the traditional smoked salmon.  We rounded the meal off with the sticky toffee pudding, which was the only real miss of the the whole experience. I suggested it based on other people's reviews about it.. don't get me wrong, this dessert is good in terms of flavour, texture, presentation, etc. The only problem with it is that it is sickeningly sweet. As in, I literally gagged every time I took a bite due to the sugary fumes emanating from each morsel. If they could tone down the sugar content in this dessert, I'd order it again, but as it stands I couldn't eat more than a few bites before feeling sick.  Anyway, I certainly plan to return here! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered the beastwich. I like the combination of the fried chicken, biscuits and gravy. Everything tasted good together but if judged separately they would need a little work. Biscuit was too crumbly and the gravy didn't hold too much flavour. Didn't get a chance to try their famous donuts but the French press coffee was tasty and the server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Beast is an amazing gem! I love the decor and the small charm of it. As well, the service is very friendly and they do their best to accommodate even though they are a smaller restaurant. Most importantly, THE FOOD! My boyfriend got the beastwich while I got the el pollo loco with an added egg. Both amazing choices! I loved the zing of tomato sauce of the el pollo loco and their hot sauces are seriously great! What we weren't expecting was how great the salad would be. I don't know what they do with that dressing but it made me want to go back for dinner and have more. Overall, amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:13am , and was being told to wait outside for another half an hour. Food comes so late.... we end it up staying there for more than 2 hours!  Food is ok parking is tough to find as usual since it is down town. All in all, a slow paced small resto, I do not even feel cozy inside the resto. It is too cold when people come and go from the resto."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a brunch at Beast last Sunday while visiting Toronto. Restaurant was full and busy for brunch but we were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. Both my fiance and I enjoyed a dark and stormy with breakfast, which were perfectly gingery.   We wanted an order of the daily doughnuts but arrived much too late as they were sold out, we were told that we were almost guaranteed an order if we had arrived by 11:30am but by 12:00pm they were often sold out. Instead we shared the delicious poutine of the day which happened to be braised short ribs. This dish was delicious and we highly recommend enjoying it no matter the meat of the day is as we are sure it will always be tasty, our one criticism of the dish is that as a whole the dish was soft and screaming for some crunch or texture. While we love a nice soft and pillowy gnocchi, which we artfully made, the dish needed some textural contrast.  For entrees we enjoyed the Breakfast sandwich, grilled pork belly which had a delightfully smoky taste, pickled onions, lettuce, and a fried egg the shining star was the kozlik's sweet and smokey mustard which really made this delicious sandwich. The menu said that the sandwich is served on an apple fritter which had me a little skeptical as where I come from and apple fritter is a very dense, super sweet doughnut type pastry. Luckily, this sandwich was on a very light buttery delicious bread similar to a croissant. My fiance ordered the crispy pork hocks which were amazing! It was our favorite item of brunch, rich, sweet, salty and absolutely delicious. The pork hocks were picked and pressed into cube like shapes so for those of you whom don't like to deal with bones you are in the clear! Both were served with home fries.  The only down fall to our visit was the decor which was a little hard on the eyes, the huge amount of dust specifically on the track lighting and in the restroom, and the numerous burned out light bulbs. When dust and lights don't matter to owners and management it makes you wonder what else is slipping through the cracks. All and all awesome meal, we would go back and would recommend this restaurant to other.  Give Beast a try."}
{"text":"New restaurant alert!  I'm loving the fact that this place is literally a few steps away from my house and sports one of the best and intimate patios in the downtown area.    Beast* took over the space that was Amuse-Bouche. I'm not sure what the story is on the latter or why they closed, but they were there for five years and seemed a too upscale for me. But Beast is brand-spanking new, having launched just five days ago. Their transformation was sudden to say the least as I hadn't noticed the change at all (odd since I live in the neighbourhood.) Even odder was when my friends and I were looking for a place to eat, they told me about a cute restaurant with a patio near my house. I was positive that they were confusing it with another place but nope, to my surprise, it was Beast.   Okay, the food: absolutely delicious. Yes, only two adjectives are required here. The brunch menu was short and simple, about six-seven items that included eggs but also burgers and french toast. I also took a peak at their dinner menu which looks incredible.   Here's the rundown: duck, fois gras, ribeye steak, cornish hen, and all of them at reasonable prices. Our wonderful server told us that the menu changes slightly from week to week, which means that I will have to return on a weekly basis to make sure to try those items and not miss anything.   I ordered the duck confit ($12) that included shredded pieces of duck, potatoes (cut into small squares) and a sunny-side egg up on top. Delicious is the best word to describe it. My friend ordered french toast which came with maple and blueberry syrup and toasted pecans - I tried it, also very good. We washed down our meals with fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee brewed from beans by Sam James Coffee Bar. They also have a nice wine list and tea menu that included rooibos, peppermint, and genmaicha.   I hope Beast is here to stay - I'm planning my next brunch date next weekend and there had better be room on the patio for this lady.  ---  *I'm also in love with their name. They probably didn't name themselves after one of my favourite Montreal indie rock bands, but I'd like to think that they did."}
{"text":"Hi, we were a party of four last night and had a fabulous time. All of the staff were so friendly and it was a really nice atmosphere. The food was delicious and it was served tapas style which was  great to share. Everything was very very  good and I finished it off with my favorite sticky toffee pudding. We will def be back."}
{"text":"Super cute and the food is great. Love the donuts!! Lots of unique coffee options. Been a couple times and had both the Beastwich and french toast with duck confit and loved both."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  We actually did brunch on Friday (they do brunch on Friday!) our first morning in Toronto. Great choice for not being overcrowded - and, it's a small room. Wonderful across the board with a huevos rancheros (perfect eggs, great seasoning), a french toast with cranberries, a couple of poutines (good, but not great, some maple bacon donuts, and one of the biscuit sandwiches (which was good based on review, I just can't remember which one). Very nice french press coffees, great service. I think it came to about CA$ 90 for the four of use before tip. We'll definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"I had my birthday brunch here and it was delicious. The restaurant is set amongst a bunch of houses in a side street off King West/Queen West. It is inside a remodelled house. Once inside you realize the entire restaurant is essentially a living room. It is a small space. That doesn't really matter though because the food is good.  I had the Beastwich which was delicious. The chicken was good and yummy, I would have it on its own if it was offered on their lunch or dinner menu. The biscuit was flaky & light. There was a pimento cheese in the sandwich that really sets the whole thing off. The waitress suggested potatoes which I had but the Beastwich is so filling I really didn't need it. I was told about the donuts they offer but it didn't seem to be on the menu that day. I think Beast is good if you want to have a carb heavy indulgent comfort food type of meal. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This quaint little tapas restaurant might very well be one of the best food experiences in the city!  The aroma wafting through the place is worth the visit alone. The food is fresh and local. Everything tastes amazing and the menu is always changing.  The Gnocchi Poutine was amazing. As was the potato tikka masala and the rabbit cavatelli pasta. You really can't go wrong. Even the bread and butter are among the best I've tasted.  The portion sizes are decent considering its tapas, so if you're planning for dessert then share 3 main tapas among 2 people."}
{"text":"Definitely coming bake when I visit Toronto. I never drink coffee but I wanted to try the Colombia and it was pretty good. The buttermilk biscuit was my favorite. We ordered the crispy pig ear which was SUPER crispy. It was like eating a fried chip. Very tasty also. We ordered the special venison ragu poutine which I thought was so gamy. I was not a fan of it at all but hey if you like venison you should try it. The Pollo Loco was SOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a bit spicy though but Boy did I devour it. I really liked how super crispy the chicken was and it was tender and juicy because it was a thigh. One thing about this place is that there is no ventilation. We left and our clothes smelled like fat and oil. I couldn't stand the smell."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in Toronto for vacation, business, festival, or you just live there (because you're awesome and I'm totally jealous of your free healthcare), you have to give this place a try. I randomly came across this place on Yelp and the pictures weren't that great so I was all like,  but I am SO GLAD I WENT!   I had the Mad Maple which is a biscuit sandwich with chicken, maple syrup, egg and bacon. When I tell you I damn near had an anxiety attack in that restaurant! How is the food this good? How did they make it so fast? Why am I not Canadian? So many thoughts were going through my mind I couldn't quite get it together. This food is so good it makes you want to call your grandma and scream obscenities. It'll make you want to call an ex and be like \"you know what, I'm glad we didn't work out because me and mad maple are doing just fine!\" It is THAT good.   Like I literally ate at this place in February and am writing a review in July because 1. I forgot 2. I came back across this and was like wow....what would I give to go back to Toronto for another sandwich lol. Please come to this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty bites of food, but man, there are other spices besides salt. The delicious flavours were nearly buried in salt. Disappointing.   Beers and courses were all overpriced; the plates are tapas style, which is restaurant-speak for small and overpriced, but this was a bit much. When a dish comes with mushrooms, I'd expect more than one that's been cut into two pieces.  The ribs and poutine dishes were pretty good; I'd have been much happier if there was just some more. Or the price was cut down by a third.  Service was solid. Loved getting a breakdown and explanation; servers knew what was up and that was appreciated.   Toronto needs to get over its fascination with overpriced tapas."}
{"text":"went for weekend brunch and it was awesome! we arrived around 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line formed. we got the last available table so we were very lucky! service was understandably a bit slow because they say maybe 15 tables at the same time, but the food was well worth the wait. be aware that they can't serve you alcohol until a certain time (11 I think?) so be prepared to start with a tiny personal French press of coffee. I wish I lived in Toronto so I could go back and try everything!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this restaurant but was let down. It was a very small space. For the price that was paid, it wasn't worth it. Proportions were petite. Though selection was different then your typical food, selection was still quite limited. The taste wasn't extraordinary in any way, it was just alright. The staff was also just alright, didn't seem inviting. At the end of the day, my group of friends and I had to go get mcds after since we were still hungry  so overall, nothing too negative, but also nothing good."}
{"text":"Really good place! I would recommend to everyone for food and drinks. Tapas meals are very tasty and unique. It is unlikely that you will find the same in that area of the city. Siting outside and is amazing too!"}
{"text":"This felt like another place where the hype may have overpromised, and it just did not live up to it.   When I arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday in the middle of winter, I thought for sure I was going to be first, but I was one of the last parties to be seated, with a party of two (TIP: if your whole party isn't there, they will not seat you). The ambiance is very old timey, with definite hipster undertones. Service is good, but pretty unremarkable.   I ordered the fried chicken sandwich that came with guacamole and tomato sauce (which I got on the side) on a biscuit bun. The fried chicken was good and not overcooked, moist on the inside and crispy on the outside (what put me off, was the large pieces at the end which were just fried batter with no meat). The biscuit was fluffy, but not substantial enough for the sandwich at all, it seemed more like the piece of bread that goes under fried food to absorb the wet oil. The tomato sauce taste like blended canned tomatoes, so I'm really glad I got it on the side, it would have make the whole sandwich way too wet, and the guacamole just seemed like your standard guac.   The coffee is done in a french press, so coffee connoisseurs should be happy, but as someone who wants the coffee to flow freely with breakfast, I was not as happy by the limited french press deliverings.   Would I go back...probably only if someone else wanted to go..."}
{"text":"Came at around 8pm on a Thursday with a group of 3. We ordered lamb ribs, oysters, flank steak, rolls with pimento cheese, and pork hock. Totaled around $30 a person. Food was delicious. Meat was perfectly cooked and oysters were very fresh. Decent service. Bathrooms were stocked with lots of real hand towels, which was a cute touch."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for the weekend with some friends and was recommended to try Beast for brunch. We went on a Saturday around 11:30AM. We got there and there was a waiting list of 20-25 minutes according to our waitress, which was accurate since we got our table approximately 20 minutes later. The place inside is pretty simple with some nice and bizarre paintings on each wall. The food was very good and generous compared to the price, I had the duck french toast which is original and quite unique and very consistent.   Drawback: not a lot of options on the menu"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Brunch experience at Beast. Coming in for a late brunch on a Sunday afternoon, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table of two. Located on a quiet street, the restaurant probably doesn't look the most attractive if you walked by. Service was fine with nothing noteworthy.  The food on the otherhand was excellent:  Beastwich 5/5: Biscuits fried chicken sandwich, gravy and homefries/salad. I really enjoyed this and would recommend!  Meat Scramble 4/5: Almost like an omelette. They had an excellent sauce on top. Came with the homefries and salad sides as well.  French Press Brazil Coffee 2.5/5: Average and not really worth $4.  Overall, I really enjoyed Beast and I'd come back to try more of the menu (probably the dinner menu specifically)!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I must applaud the hostess/server who estimated realistic wait times for brunch. After seeing pictures of the Beastwich, I had to come here and I'm glad I finally did. The Beastwich was amazing BUT I could not eat it with my hands like a regular sandwich, it required a knife and fork as the bottom biscuit liked to crumble. Rachelle's donuts were also very good."}
{"text":"OMG their house potatoes were DELICIOUS!!! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with avocado. The eggs were done really well and the hollandaise was very tasty. We sat on the patio which was nice and quiet. Would definitely like to come here back."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait! Even if you have to stand outside in the cold for 45 minutes, do it! The interior is super cozy so you'll have no problem warming up when you finally sit down to eat.  The staff is really nice and make their way around the tiny space with ease. My friend and I ordered the Kenyan coffee and it was delicious served out of the French press.   We both ordered the Mad Maple sandwich for brunch: fried chicken thigh, beast bacon, ontario maple syrup, fried egg. I normally don't even like fried chicken (I know...how is that possible?) but this sandwich was everything. It looks huge but it was very easy to eat everything after standing outside and waiting for brunch. The grapefruit mimosas were delicious, too. I had two of them. I wish I could try everything on this menu. I guess I'll just have to go back!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere I had the Polo Loco which is a biscuit fried chicken sandwich with ranchero sauce and sheep's milk feta and house potatoes. This is a very unique place I have never tried anything like this before the chciken is so tender and with the sauce it melts in your mouth. Portion size is filling the pictures look bigger than the actual image. I will definetly come back here agan . Best time when there is not  alot of people is Brunch time dinner time make reservations as this place gets really packed. They have a wide variety of menu items and everything on the menu is excellent."}
{"text":"Try the beastwich, it's a hearty sandwich for your first meal of the day - but it will not disappoint.   The service was quick and responsive and they were very attentive with my dietary concerns. Couldn't have asked for more....  the beastwich: buttermilk biscuit, fried chicken thigh, pimento cheese, pork sausage gravy and a fried egg (served with house potatoes or mixed greens)"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch. The first thing i noticed was the strong smell of frying oil. The air was so heavy that I had to ask the waiter to open the door. It helped a little but by the end I smelled like a fried bacon. They should put better fans for the kitchen. We ordered french toast and the breakfast sandwich. They were both good but nothing to special. Their home made selection sauces was interesting. The coffee event though was promised to be special and was served in French press with a timer, was really  mild and eh. I wanted to try the doughnut but they were out."}
{"text":"As this was my second time in Toronto, I decided to give Beast a try to see if it lives up to the hype. Answer: YES, IT DOES.   I opted for the Beastwich and it was DELICIOUS. The chicken was nice and tender and that gravy...just wow. It was so good that I let my friend try it and she ordered a side of the gravy just to go with her meal. We also tried the Donut of the day (the name of the flavor was \"Dark and Stormy\") and it was was mouth-watering. For drinks, I got a mimosa and my friend got the dark and stormy. Both were good, but nothing super special. As far as the service, our food took about 40 mins. Wah?! But our waiter was nice and did keep checking on us. We also got to meet the chef that made the donut as well as the head chef that day. They were so nice!  Overall, I WILL be returning to Beast my next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Brunch in Toronto has been a difficult adjustment for me since moving from Sydney, Australia....where there is an abundance of gorgeous cafés and restaurants serving high quality, fresh and unique dishes. Here in Toronto, I have struggled to find anywhere that has lived up to my expectations of what a good brunch should be. Until today.  Beast is a lovely little restaurant in King West serving fantastic brunch favourites with a creative twist. We ordered the curry arancini, heuvos rancheros and the beastwich.  The curry arancini with cucumber raita reminded me of a friends authentic home cooked Dahl...the curry was delicate, the arancini crispy and the raita refreshing.  The heuvos were so yum. The tortillas stayed crunchy, the beans, chorizo and guacamole plentiful, with the spicy tomato sauce covered in feta the perfect addition.  The bf had the beast sandwich. I had a bite and it was incredible. Delicious smoky flavour.  Portions here are a great size, incredible value. French pressed coffee was really good too, as were the mimosas.  Definitely recommend and definitely will be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been eying this restaurant for brunch for a long time. When their new dessert menu came out which included a pumpkin cheesecake, we've decided it was time to visit Beast (because I have an obsession with pumpkin desserts).  Our table split an order of Rachelle's maple-bacon donuts ($5 for two donuts). The donut was delicious and a great start to our meal. It wasn't overly sweet, the bacon wasn't overpowering but you can still taste it and the actual donut was soft.  My friend got the fish cake benedict, poached eggs, lemon hollandaise, english muffin with house potatoes ($13). She enjoyed her benedict a lot but she noticed that the hollandaise sauce was not a typical hollandaise sauce. I tried some of her house potatoes and they were delicious.  My other friend ordered \"poutine\", fried gnocchi, ontario water buffalo with sheep's milk cheese curds ($9). The gnocchi was stuffed with potato and the sauce was delicious. Since I only had one bite, I thought it was nicely season but my friend had to eat the whole dish so she found it a bit on the salty side.  I ordered the sunny side duck egg hash, duck hearts, sweet potato, northern woods mushroom ragu ($12). It was good but it wasn't the favorite at the table. We all thought it tasted like an Asian dish especially with the mushrooms. The dish just wasn't what I expected it to be. Nonetheless, it tasted alright, just not as amazing as the gnocchi. I did however, really enjoyed the sweet potato in my dish.  We finished our meal off with the pumpkin cheesecake. It was so beautiful (make sure to check out the picture)! It's a thin slice of pumpkin cheesecake topped with melted marshmallow and nicely torched. Thankfully, it tasted as good it looked! We were shocked when we saw the price of the cheesecake on the bill - $10. If the cheesecake was doubled its size, I think $10 may have been reasonable. Good thing we didn't split another dessert (we were tempted by the sticky toffee pudding).  The service here was good (mind you, we came here when it wasn't super busy). I thought that the decor and ambiance were lovely. I would definitely come back here if they have something interesting on their menu."}
{"text":"We came here for tapas with the expectation that they are small plates and will be a little more spendy. With that being said, we still felt that the tapas were overpriced for what we got.  The food was tasty overall but we found that most dishes were too heavily salted. Some of the food was actually just average. We were really surprised that there is so much hype around this place.  The service was a pretty big disappointment. The staff are surprisingly rude and have a \"should-you-be-so-lucky-to-eat-here\" attitude. The table service was slow and the kitchen even slower. Food took an unreasonable amount of time to arrive. Overall, a chaotic vibe here and general indifference to customers who are waiting for a table.  I feel like there are much better places in Toronto. I would not come back again."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had.  My friends and I were visiting for the weekend and we were really excited to check this place out and it was amazing. It exceeded our expectations. We left the restaurant happy and seriously full, but still wanting more.   Place is small, quaint and cute and the prices are very reasonable. We made reservations beforehand and were seated right away. Service was on point as well.    We shared the roasted Brussels Sprouts over hummus, Beef Cheeks, Pork Hocks and Chicken Parm \"Poutine.\" All the apps were really good and came out fairly quick. The pork hocks were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - it literally melted in my mouth. The apps were all really good and everything your app comes with must be eaten together to get the full-on experience of its taste and texture. Our favorites were the poutine and Brussels sprouts.   We then ordered the main dishes. The Beastwich, The Bruce Leroy and The Mad Maple. The biscuits were soft and flaky and the chicken was warm and crispy (not too greasy or dry). The Beastwich was really good. The pork sausage gravy that goes on top of the biscuit sandwich was to die for. The Mad maple was also a favorite of the night - if you like sweet and savory, this is a must!   We were amazed by everything we ordered because it was just so flavorful and delicious. Please do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I only tried one cocktail and two shared two desserts with my friend, but Beast is always a four stars to me.   Just like most other restaurants on King street west, Beast has the very comfortable and fashionable decoration, as well as great customer service, who are super friendly and professional.   I ordered the Cherry Blossom, which is good but nothing too special. But the \"desserts sticky toffee pudding, toffee sauce, creme fraiche\" is just febulous! And it is only $10. Some people may find it too sweet, but for me it is just perfect. The pudding is so tasty, mainly because of the taste of toffee, and the sauce is hot, sweet, and creamy.   My friend told me Beast also have very outstanding brunch and high-quality dinner. I'm sure I will come back to Beast and then finish this review."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with one friend.  Ambiance: When you walk in you have a feeling you walked into someones apartment.  The place has a very cozy homey feeling to it.  There are 5 tables for 2 people, 4 for 4 people, and 3 for larger groups.   They got a patio (it was closed when I was there, but in the summer it would very nice as it is on the quite street).   Service (5 stars):  There was one person serving everyone, when we got there there the place was mostly empty. The sever came and got us water and was attentive the whole time.  Food (5 stars): The food was amazing.  Pretty grease but delicous never the less I got the Mad Maple (fried chicken thigh, beast bacon, ontario maple syrup and egg).  It came with a side salad.    My friend got: huevos rancheros: crispy corn tortillas, mexican-style chorizo, refried black beans, guacamole.  The cost for each of us with tax and tip was $18.19"}
{"text":"I came here for Brunch on a Sunday morning, and the place had a good energy to it, but we still had no problem getting a table which I loved. There is quite a few things on their brunch menu that appeal to me, but we started with the maple bacon donut, which was pretty good. They make a variety of different donuts, and I would totally recommend starting with one to share. For my actual meal I got the Beastwich and I have no regrets. The fried chicken thigh was massive, and looked to be comprised of many chicken thighs put together, battered and then fried. It was juicy, and the batter was very crispy. The star of the show was definitely the chicken thigh and sausage gravy, while the buttermilk biscuit was really just a vehicle for it. The sandwich also has pimento cheese and a fried egg on it. I guess my only criticism was that the fried egg could have been more runny, as I don't think it was at all, but I would still recommend this dish. Their breakfast sandwich also sounds divine and I think I would try that the next time I went for brunch, and I'm pretty sure I will be back."}
{"text":"**Dinner - reservation is a must. I came here on a weekday before and restaurant was packed. Their dinner menu change quite often based on seasons. They also have a whole-animal dinner which I really wanna try! Overall service is not that good. Servers aren't friendly and they will rush you, especially during brunch. For dinner I had the following:   -bison flank $18: The taste was very similar to beef and it did not taste gamey. There was quite a bit of heat which I think came from the smoke harissa and the black garlic added a hint of sweetness, which paired well with the bison.  -scallops $18: the scallops had a nice golden brown crust and had a tender, springy center. I liked the slightly sweet quince BBQ sauce which accentuated the earthiness flavor of the hazelnut and did not overwhelmed the natural taste of the juicy scallops.  **Brunch - no reservation and come early! Restaurant is really small and get filled up quickly.   Also, get the DONUTS if they are still available. I hate dessert and Rachelle's donut was probably the best I have had so far! Not too sweet with a nice texture :). For brunch I had the followings:   -poutine $12: The light and fluffy yet chewy potato gnocchi was covered in a delectable gravy and pulled pork. You really can't go wrong adding a melting cheese curds to an already great dish, and I love how the curds still maintained its squeakiness and volume.  -huevos rancheros $14: There's nothing like a runny golden fried egg, tomato sauce packed with flavors, and fresh corn tortillas to start my morning. It would have been better if they didn't skimp on the avocados, because you know, who doesn't love to bite into big creamy chunks of avocado!  -crispy pork hocks $14: The pork hocks had a super crispy skin yet when you bite into them, these were incredibly soft and tender. Love how the chef balanced out the fatty pork hocks with a mildly spicy and sour kimchi. Salad wasn't drenched in dressings but potato is not consistent, can be overdone sometimes.   -the bruce leroy $14: Golden brown crispy skin and perfectly cooked chicken thigh. The biscuit was quite dry. I actually found the sweet soy sauce to be overpowering and the sandwich became incredibly salty after a few bite"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday,  at 12:30 you would think line up will be shorter. Got seated at 1:30. There is no indoor seating or waiting area, so we had to stand outside to wait.   Looking at fellow yelpers' pictures, the Beastwich seems to be a popular choice so that's what I ordered.  The pictures I saw had greens on the side. I guess I have to order that on the side because mine didn't come with it.   My son had the Mad maple. Crispy chicken, bacon, fried egg with maple syrup on a biscuit. I liked this better than the beast which but I could probably just eat half because it is too sweet.   Most of the menu items have fried chicken in it. So definitely not a vegan destination.   Disappointed that they didn't have regular coffee nor cappuccino. They have the French pressed coffee. Different flavours to choose from but most of them are fruit infused or sweet ( like sugarcane, or marshmallow).   The place is small. Faster to be seated if you come in 2s. They can't accommodate groups of 8 or more.   The floor was vibrating, felt like there's a machine underneath. A lot of mirrors on the wall and some weird pieces of art- animal head with human hands lying down on the grass.   I think this place is geared more towards the younger generation. The music, the decor, the high calorie menu items. I feel old!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat tapas style   The wild boar gnocchi poutine is a must have and don't miss getting the sticky toffee pudding. It's the best I've never had in my whole life. I think about it weekly"}
{"text":"Just finished brunching with some out of town guests and the only reason I'm giving Beast a 3 out of 5 is because the food was pretty good.  Not great, but pretty good.  There's enough good places to dine in Toronto and there's enough competition that it always surprises me when places don't give a crap about the service they provide their customers.  Pretty good food and terrible service is a fantastic recipe for the eventual slaying of beasts.  We waited for over an hour for our food, had to ask for such outlandish things as more water and the drinks we ordered, and when asking the waitress how much longer it would be she simply told us everyone else was waiting as well, so too bad.  I don't blame her completely - I think she was the only one on staff - I blame the management for not understanding the first rule of business - treat your customers well.  I will not be returning and will not be recommending this shining example of mediocrity."}
{"text":"During my stay in Toronto, me and a couple friends went to try Canadian food. Since I'm Korean, every time I see kimchi anywhere on the menu, that's usually what I pick.  For apps: We had the fried mussels, poutine, and the pork hocks. The poutine was really great! They were with gnocchi and you can really taste the chicken parm in it. Definitely try the poutine since that's what Canada is known for. The mussels, same as in NY. Fried, seasoned, etc- nothing so spectacular. The pork hocks were good but nothing outstanding.  For my sandwich, I had the Bruce Leroy. It has kimchi in it with fried chicken. OK- the kimchi was not kimchi at all. Idk where they get the idea of calling it kimchi bc I couldn't taste any kimchi flavor whatsoever. It was more of a really salty fermented cabbage.... pickled vegetable more like. Besides that let down, the Bruce Leroy was very good! I'd probably get it again but would take out the kimchi- too salty."}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch today at Beast.  Though it's been around for about six years, we just heard about it a couple months ago and wanted to check it out.  It seats about 35 people and was jammed when we got there about 10:45am.  We got the second last free table.  Gord started with an Ethiopian coffee which is made with a French press.  A timer lets you know when it's ready  We both ordered the Labatt 50 breakfast.  Gord got his with a Labatt 50 and I got mine with a mimosa.   Gord got his breakfast with Beast bacon, challah bread and half mixed greens and half potatoes.  He said it was very good.  I got mine with peameal bacon, challah bread and potatoes.  Mine too was very good.  They also serve fresh donuts and today's flavours were maple bacon, chocolate mocha and caramel glazed with Chicago popcorn on top.  I had planned on getting one for dessert but I didn't have any room.  Next time!  Aliza was our server and she took good care of us.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"i came here for brunch last week and really liked it.  The food was delicious and I will prob be back.  I'm only giving 3 stars for a very personal taste reason and that is the coffee.  It's $4 for one cup of coffee, which to me is just way too expensive.  I don't care how artisanal the beans are.  I also tend drink coffee slow, so when my coffee cup is 1/3 full and cold my only option is to order another $4 cup of coffee.  Maybe i'm jsut too accustomed to the standard brunch where i get my coffee topped up constantly and therefore never goes cold.    Anyways...i like this place"}
{"text":"I took the weekend to mull over this one because I still haven't been able to wrap my head around how good this place was.  I went here with a bachelor party to do the Beast 120. It's worth every penny. We selected Wild Boar with an adventurous rating of 7/10. We were told that the menu will pend on what meats they can get from their butcher the week before. I've never had such a meal where I was in such awe of each dish that rolled out.  Cured Boar shoulder with Parker Rolls - This wasn't really a course but it was a great started the meat is perfectly cured and the rolls were fresh and delicious.  Boar Schnitzel with a Garden Salad on top - This was a great way to start the meal, with something familiar. I loved the use of Ontario berries to give that sweetness and acidity to the dish. The schnitzel was fried perfectly with the right amount of crunch to it.  Boar Jowls on a Kimchi Jicima Slaw Salad - I was nervous about this one. It turned out to be one of the best dishes of the night. I didn't know where the fat and where the meat began/ended. So flavorful and cooked to perfection! The salad below it was a nice touch.  \"Poutine\" Gnocchi with Boar Chili - A really inventive dish that screamed Canada in so many ways. Other than the fact it was a poutine, there was a strong use of the animal and a different blend of spices and ingredients that it could only be classified as Canadian.  Boar Tongue on a bed of Hummus and Asparagus - I never liked tongue. I had a bad experience one and have never have eaten it again. Given how well this meal went, I gave it another stab and I couldn't have been happier with that decision.The texture was great and the flavor really came through.  Boar BBQ Ribs on Collard Greens - The ribs were great, the only problem I had was that I was so full by then that I don't think i could have properly enjoyed thew ribs as intended. The Collard Greens were spot on and I was well on my way to a food coma by this point  Hong Kong French Toast with Male Ice Cream and Ground Bacon - This dish was EXACTLY what I needed to top off the meal, the French Toast and the ice cream melded so well together. It wasn't too sweet nor too savory either. It was just perfect.  The staff were friendly and willing to attend to us when we were there. I had such a great time here and I can't recommend it more than I already have. Keep in mind you will most likely not get the exact menu that I listed above, their menu changes and I would recommend to not find out what you are getting when you do the Beast 120. The surprises are worth it!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Sunday around 10:30-11AM. We expected to wait a bit as they do not take reservations, but were seated within 20 minutes. The food was pretty good, we each got a different type of biscuit. The biscuits were interesting and creative. The potatoes were not good. I think what really drove down the points here was the service. It's a small place that seems to have a hard time accommodating a crowd...both in the kitchen and with the servers. I think there were 2-3 servers there, but they were also the hosts and the bus crew, so they were doing everything which delayed service significantly. All in all, I would only come back on a quieter day."}
{"text":"I had an amazing brunch at Beast with friends. The wait was really long if you try to come late morning. If you arrive early enough, you will have a great table and an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, especially the lamb ribs. Great ambience and friendly staff. We came here later in the evening so there wasn't a wait but the restaurant is small so a reservation might be a good idea during peak hours."}
{"text":"The food here deserves five stars.   We started out with the raspberry hazelnut doughnut. Simply delicious. We were hoping for a maple bacon doughnut but those were sold out by the time we were seated. It's a bit unfortunate when the restaurant runs out of it's specialty half way through operating hours.  For my brunch, I opted for the huevos rancheros. It's a spicy and filling dish with plenty of seasoning. It's a great option if you're looking for a mexican influenced breakfast.  I also tried some of the challah french toast with duck confit. It was awesome too.The interior was very soft while the crust had pleasant brittleness to it.  I was unimpressed with the management. We came here during prime-time brunch hours to find open tables and a wait-list. The restaurant was not seating empty tables because they were understaffed. I can sympathize with an emergency, but management needs to do everything it can to ensure they're operating a full capacity. It looks bad on them when only three-forths of the tables are filled and potential clients are leaving because there is a wait.  Also, there was an issue with wasps flying around the outdoor tables and patrons were not allowed to move indoors if they became irritated by the wasps. I am perplexed as to why customers were being seated under such disagreeable circumstances.  All in all, great food!"}
{"text":"Brunch review on a recent Sunday: We got there around 1:30 pm and we had to put our name on the waiting list. We waited outside as it wasn't too cold (& no place to wait inside) for about 20 mins.   Most of the brunch dishes had meat esp pork as the name of the Resto implies.   The service was prompt once seated. We didn't have a great table...we were right by the door but even the velvet curtain could not keep the chill out. All the other tables seemed fine and it was quaint and cozy inside otherwise. I honestly can't remember the decor - it didn't stand out for me nor was it distracting.   We both ordered the Huevos rancheros: one with chorizo and one without. There was a fried tortilla at the bottom, black beans, a little bit of guacamole, some rice, etc. I had the house salad on the side and asked for the dressing on the side. The dressing was yummy - not what I expected as it tasted very unique but may not be to everyone's taste.   My friend didn't like the home fries and said they were cold. His was without chorizo. He only ate half or less of his place. He said the same thing was better at the restaurant Easy.   I enjoyed mine and ate every bite. I was so full afterwards (in a good way) - good portion size. Although I did add their house made hot sauce which is yummy.   I would go back but maybe not for a few months. It won't become my go to place for brunch in that area. But I hope it does well!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a saturday.   Ordered the beastwich and french toast with duck confit, beastwich was awesome! Great flavor on every bite sooo recommending this dish. The french toast on the other side was ok. Nothing special. The duck confit was good but the french toast was just your plain old moms french toast. I would stick to something else. Ordered the decaf coffee was very pricy $4 for a cup. Nothing too special too.  Anyway still a good brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing here really stood out. I ordered a bunch of dinners since I was only in town for a week but they all were edible but nothing more than that."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and walking to this place, was sure we were in for a treat! Approaching the restaurant, still promising. It was raining they weren't open yet and there was a line of people out front.  The \"bad\" The place is small, the wait staff wasn't overly helpful. She seemed hurried as they were anticipating being busy. No-one asked if we've been there before, there were no suggestions or ask if we had questions of the menu. No-one pointed out the board where the specials were written. There is also no kids menu. We ordered a few items to try. Donuts, on the menu, they weren't making that day. Poutine, on the menu, was prepared with the gravy of the day regularly. Our flavor was \"curry goat\" ordered for a 10 Y/O who thought he was getting poutine.   The Good: Possibly one of the best cups of coffee I've had in ages. Despite the surprises of the gravy of the day, the gnocchi \"poutine\" was delicious. The Huevos Rancheros was also very good. Decent sized portion.  Under the right conditions, I am sure this place is the gem that people have described. Unfortunately we weren't able to see it shine."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Friday night dinner. The service and atmosphere were excellent, but the food was just OK.   Food: We ordered the gnocchi poutine, the beef hocks, the mad maple sandwich, and the club sandwich. I was really excited to try the poutine but found the gnocchi to be bland. The pulled beef sauce was good and added a lot to the dish. The beef hocks were excellent - crispy and flavorful with a sauce that was truly divine. Both sandwiches were also good, if a tad messy and underseasoned. The biscuits were flavorful, and the chicken itself was wonderfully crispy but lacking that salty bite I've come to expect w/ fried chicken.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is small and dark, which gives it a rather cozy, romantic feel.  Service: Very attentive and very kind."}
{"text":"My 2 star rating has nothing to do with the food. The food as everyone says, is fabulous and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The reason i rated this restaurant so low is because of how they treat their paying customers. I arrived at 10:30AM knowing that there would be a bit of a wait, and having read all the rules, understood that this is the experience at Beast. However, they chose to break their coveted rules, and let a table of 10 ppl make a reservation on a Sat (of all days!!!) at 11AM. As all everyone knows, Beast makes it very clear that they do not take reservations of tables larger than 8ppl, and with good reason as the place is tiny. When the table of 10ppl still had not shown up at 11:30AM, I went in to ask what was going on. I was told that this was a friend of the owners, and this is why the rules were being broken. For full paying customers who follow the rules, to have to wait for this table of ten to finally arrive late just to find out that they were friends is really sad - not a good choice at all on the owners part, to make your loyal customers that sing your praises, wait and watch as you showed favoritism to your friends on a Sat at Brunch!!! Will not be going back since the owners make the rules as they go."}
{"text":"Beast is a cozy little restaurant nestled in a King west residential neighbourhood. Due to the size of the restaurant and lack of ventilation, your clothes will smell after however the tasty food they serve will more than compensate for the that.    There were 13 of us on a Friday night. The service was great! The staff were all very friendly and efficient. We order a bunch of tapas off the menu and shared. Couple of notable mentions are the peach salad and the short rib. The salad was light and crispy while the short rib was savoury and tender.  I also like the curry chicken balls in addition to the dozen of oysters we had.   Tips: they have buck a shack oysters and $5 drinks between 5-7pm. Slurp!"}
{"text":"While in a Toronto coffee shop we overheard a couple talking about Maple Bacon Doughnuts, and i immediately asked them who was baking these delicious treats?  They told me the restaurant was Beast, but suggested getting there early because they do sell out.  I made a mental note of that and just last week while in the city to get our TIFF tickets, we came for brunch.  I have had the maple bacon doughnut twice at Los Angeles' Nickel Diner.  They were pretty much the first place baking  them, and there have been many unsuccessful copycats.  I am thrilled to say that Beast is not one of them.  The doughnut is yeast base and it had a wonderful chew to it, and it wasn't greasy.  The bacon on top was chopped pretty fine, it was perfectly salty, and went amazing with the sweet maple syrup.  We didn't want to spoil our appetite so we split the doughnut in three, but i could have easily had it and maybe another.  For food, two of us had the beastwich: buttermilk biscuit, fried chicken thigh, pimiento cheese, 2 fried eggs, pork sausage gravy and house potatoes for $12.  There were alot of components to this dish and i worried that it would be heavy or very difficult to eat.  It came to the table, beautifully presented, the sandwich was great but this is not the type where you can pick it up and eat it, a knife and fork were necessary.  The biscuit was so tender, the chicken thigh was juicy and crispy, and  the pimento was slightly spicy.  The highlight of the sandwich was the sausage gravy, it completed the southern inspired dish.  It also came with house potatoes and i could have done without them.  They lacked seasoning and they were a bit hard.   My sis had the challah french toast: topped with duck confit, fresh Ontario fruit and whipped creme fraiche served with a side of maple syrup for $13.  The combination of meat with sweet breakfast dishes works so well.  The addition of duck confit was something that we never had before, it was good.  The one part that didn't work was the whipped creme fraiche that sat atop the duck confit.  Due to the temperature of the french toast and duck, the dairy just melted, and didn't add anything to the dish.   Overall i loved Beast, their menu is so inventive, i love the outdoor seating, and i cant wait to come back for another doughnut."}
{"text":"Super yummy food, cheap wine on Wednesday nights, and excellent service!  My date and I came here on a Wednesday and got a bottle of wine for half the price. We're already off to a good start. We ordered a vegetable dish, a fish dish, a meat dish, and a dessert all to share and were totally swept away. I could write an explanation for each dish, but this review would go on and on. Just go and try for yourself! It's quite similar to the Black Hoof, which also uses atypical parts and cuts of the animal but Beast is markedly different in style and flavour...You can't really compare the 2 besides the fact that they are \"tip to tail\" restaurants are both totally wonderful. Beast does have more fish and vegetable dishes making it just a little more vegetarian and pescatarian friendly. Our waiter was really friendly, was super knowledgeable about the dishes and recommended a great wine. Super pleased with service. My one criticism is of the decor. Walking in, the place seems a little dank for the kind of food it serves. It had a bit of a tavern/cottage feel which wasn't bad, but it didn't seem to suit the awesome food. And the lighting looked like it came from Ikea in the 90s. I feel like they could improve on the decor, but with food and service like that, they don't have to change a damn thing if they don't want to. I'd love to come back and try their brunch, I've only heard good things.   A+, guys."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant in the heart of downtown. I came here with my sister on a Thursday night on a whim. She had heard that it was good and that was enough of a recommendation to give it a try.  We had four dishes and they were all superb. First, we both started off with the yellow pepper soup. My first taste didn't blow me away because I found it a little sour and thin, but after a few spoonfuls I was really digging this soup. Something I wouldn't have made myself, but it was really good.  Next was a beet salad which wasn't overly complex...nice and refreshing.  We then had the wild boar gnocchi poutine which for me was the star of the night. So rich and balanced. Everything in this dish worked together.  Finally we had the veal sweetbreads (special). Nothing spectacular here, but cooked properly and with some nice side vegetables/pickles to accent the sweetbread. I did find it a touch filmy.  Their beer menu isn't fantastic, but did have a good selection of Ontario craft beer, so it was good enough for a meal.  The service was perfect, nice and attentive without being annoying."}
{"text":"Another good hidden gem. Small, with only a a handful of tables inside. Used to come here for their brown bag $10 lunches which featured a different sandwich every week. Good buy and usually comes with a side and a dessert. Brunch is truly special though. I'm a sucker for the beastwich and someone always gets the French toast. They sling some serious donuts too! Haven't done the full \"nose to tail\" experience they offer yet but it's on the bucket list. Place has been featured on a few TV shows, so it does get busy on weekends. Go early."}
{"text":"This place is hidden away, and very easy to walk past, but I'm glad we stumbled onto it.   The menu is miles away from normal fare, but everything is very approachable and was prepared to perfection.   The highlights for me were the mussels, the lamb ribs and the pork hocks. All well balanced flavours and textures.   The sticky toffee pudding was just insanely good.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Beast is one of my favourite breakfast spots to go to anytime I'm visiting Toronto. I've gone about 2-3 times now and have been satisfied each and every time ! Be warned though you should show up early because this place fills up fast since there is limited seating inside. That being said , if you do end up having to wait rest assure it will be well worth it. The items on the menu are always unique (and they do switch up the menu now and again) and the ingredients are always fresh, from the beastwich to the eggs Benedict etc we enjoyed everything we tasted! Another plus is that the service is always very friendly and helpful when trying to make a choice from the menu (because if you're like me you're going to want to order one of everything !). The pricing here is also very fair and especially fair when you take into account the sizeable portions of great quality delicious food. I recommend Beast to anyone who is looking for some great brunch in Toronto and I can't wait to go back there myself next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"Sweet Baby Jesus get yourself to this place ASAP!  Went in around 8pm on Friday, pleased to find that the place was busy but not in that loud screaming at your date kind of way. We were seated immediately, and our server informed us that ordering is kind of tapas/sharing/small plate style. Between the two of us, we ordered 5 dishes, which was the perfect amount of food. We started with the field greens, which was good, but not something you necessarily have to order--I mean it's salad...moved on to the fried squid which was RIDICULOUS. Crispy, light, amazing thai basil and my husband wanted to order a second batch. We also had the ham hocks on kimchee, which was superb. Kimchee was really spicy and nicely offset by the fat of the ham. Oh...and let's talk about the Wild Boar Poutine for a second. Instead of fries it's deep fried cheese gnocchi, with a wild boar ragout and Quebec cheese curds. I would eat it every day of my life if I thought I could do that and still fit out my doors.   The menu changes every week, with some staples staying on, depending on what's available from the farms and what inspires the chef/owner.  Would DEFINITELY go there again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Beast on Sunday for brunch.  He had been super excited to try this place out for a while but every time we drive past the place or consider it, the line up is ridiculously long.    We got there around 11:30 am on Sunday and there was already a lineup.  We were prepared to wait this time!  So we put down our names on the list and my boyfriend asked the hostess how long she thought a table for 2 would take.  She said it would be about an hour and told us that we should go walk around.  So we walked towards Queen to grab a coffee.  Literally, we were gone for 20 minutes or less and when we walked back, my boyfriend checked in with her again to see where we were on the list and apparently she had called our names.  So we missed the reservation because the hostess had poor judgement of what was going on in the dining room.  It was more upsetting because she put us at the end of the list where we had to wait TWO additional hours to get seated.  I felt like it was a HUGE waste of time because her judgement of the dining area was so poor that it cost us over 2 hours of our afternoon.    She did not even offer to bump us up.    After 2 hours of waiting, we finally get seated.  The food and the service (other than the hostess) was great.  We shared the buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy (you should add the pimento cheese! - definitely recommended).  I had the Labatt 50 breakfast (without the 50 and added the sausage gravy again LOL). I ordered the peameal bacon and it was amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the pork hocks and again amazing. The food was outstanding and I would definitely go back there.  The food is definitely heavy but it's worth it."}
{"text":"For food lovers, a great hole in the wall restaurant in a quiet neighbourhood that offers great tasting and interesting food. The decor is pretty much non-existent, but the staff is very friendly and know their stuff. With a constantly changing menu seasonal menu with a few staples that are always available- gnocci poutine, and dirty rice balls are excellent, and the baked goods and desserts are very tasty. If by some miracle you have room after the main meal definitely try the sticky toffee pudding - it's rich enough to be a meal in itself. In the summer the patio is very nice, mostly shaded by some giant old trees."}
{"text":"Very good portion sizes. Biscuits are light and flaky overall all our food was very tasty. Only criticism is coffee could be stronger. Get here early for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Beast had a rather homey feel, when you walk in it feels like you're going over to a friend's place for dinner. It's not like restaurants nowadays where the establishment feels like it needs to be boujie to be accepted.  The chef at Beast I feel follows the same food philosophy as David Chang, the food doesn't have to be pretentious to be tasty.  The food at Beast is a clear representation of the direction in which food should be headed in Toronto. Their simple brussel sprout dish was infused with middle eastern flavours, with flavors of tahini and za'atar.  It is the modern day Canadian cuisine, it's essentially Canada on a plate, they take influences from all pockets of Toronto."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and got everything on the happy hour menu - that's about 6 dishes for $5 each and selections of wine and beer for $5 each. Great quality, and even if the dishes are bad, it can't even be considered a mistake. For this happy hour experience, it really cannot be beat. When we arrived around 5:30pm, it wasn't busy at all and the service was very nice and casual.   Would I go back for dinner? I would try it. It does get quite a bit more expensive but based on this experience, I would go back for more.  ---  If you like this type of dining, there are a bunch of places in Quebec City like Renard that absolutely destroy it. Those are like 10 stars each."}
{"text":"This review is super late to the table but I'll write it anyway.  I've been wanting to try Beast for a long, long time...finally got a chance for a friend's birthday brunch.  Our group of 6 arrived around 11am on a Saturday morning.  Happy to report that there was no lines or wait list.  Patio tables were snatched up first but plenty of tables still available inside.  We ordered 2 doughnuts ($5) to start - maple bacon and dulce de leche with coconut.  Truth be told, I was holding back the desire to gobble both myself instead of dividing them both 6 ways for sharing (only women would do that by the way).    Mains - I went with the crispy pork hocks with 2 eggs over easy, potatoes, toast and kimchee ($12).  Delish but I'm a kimchee fiend and could have used more...much more - just bring me the barrel!  Others ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo, French Toast with duck confit, Beast-wich and the Labatt 50 breakfast (sans Labatt 50).    Since I'm off caffeine, I ordered a darjeeling tea ($3) and we loved that all coffee and teas were made to order in a personal French press or tea pot accompanied by a timer that indicated the steep time.    Service was decent with an automatic 18% gratuity for groups of 6 or more, which was fine.  I will so be back for the happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered: Raspberry hazelnut donut, and Challah french toast  Pros--The donut was homemade from scratch and very light. The french toast came with savory duck confit and was accompanied with creme fraiche and a cranberry compote. The combination was great texture and flavor-wise.   Cons--I was told the wait time would be about 25 minutes and it took much longer. The restaurant was understaffed which was the cause of this wait. They should have been more prepared since it's clearly a popular brunch spot. They also ran out early on of maple bacon donuts, which was their specialty. This was disappointing. Ironically the back of one of the staff member's shirt said \"got maple bacon donuts?\""}
{"text":"After having made the saucy mistake of trying to just walk in for Saturday brunch around noon (and then facing an hour+ wait time), I returned months later right at 10am on A Saturday right when the place opens. Our party of 2 got seated effortlessly and immediately.   Beastwich: the brunch version has a fried egg added but the winner is the fried chicken thigh and the melty biscuit. There's PLENTY of gravy but it doesn't smother the sandwich, which I appreciate.  Found the French press coffee a little bland."}
{"text":"Cool, hip restaurant. Interesting menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Food is great, the atmosphere is simple and service was great too. Their biscuit chicken was so filling but could not stop eating them. I would revisit this place for the brunch if i feel lime chicken again.  Thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Where do carnivores go when they die? Surely it's straight to Happy Hour at Beast. (But only if you were good. If you were bad, you probably will be sent to Live Organic Food Bar). Anyway, Beast = MEAT HEAVEN.  On Wednesday, Thursdays and Fridays between 4-6pm, Beast does the \"Beast 120 Happy Hour\" (the 120 minutes between 4-6pm). They offer a variety of wine at $5 per glass and several beer selections at $4, along with a tapas menu with small portions at $4 each.  Being a meat lover, I wanted to try this place. Being cheap, I wanted to go during happy hour.  3 of us started off with the charcuterie large sized plate for $15. Amazing! There were 5 selections - a fois gras, rabbit terrine, prosciutto, venison with blueberries, plus one other, served on a PIG shaped board! This was truly delicious. Eric L described their fois gras perfectly \"so smooth - it's like ice cream, except it's meat\". The charcuterie pairs perfectly with their side of \"Rachel's bread and butter\".  Others arrived later and we continued to order: Pastrami and cheese on a biscuit (which was two sliders), the poutine (tater tots with cheese and pulled pork), dirty rice fritters, duck hearts, mushrooms on toast.   I really enjoyed everything but my favourite dishes were the poutine and the sliders.  We also saw someone else ordering the lamb ribs..I'm totally getting those next time!!  The service was amazing here. We had two servers and both were attentive and friendly, plus they did an excellent job of explaining what we were being served.   2 drinks each and splitting the 5-6 tapas items came out to only $22-ish per person, including tax and tip.   They have a patio! This is a must-do on Fridays after work. Tell your boss you have a dental appointment and please - go get your BEAST on."}
{"text":"Be still my heart. Finally, a neighbourhood brunch place. Why didn't I come here sooner? Believe the hype, at least for brunch.  Friday brunch was AMAZING. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros and Beastwich. Let me tell you, the portions look deceiving. If they look big to you, they are GIANT. I could not finish my meal which is a rarity. But quality is another thing. And here quality is great. My fried thigh was so juicy, flavourful and crispy. Not to mention my fresh biscuit, actually flavourful cheese and luscious sausage gravy. His Heuvos held up to all the delicious, soggy ingredients.  The coffee and donuts are another delicious feature. $4 for a cup of coffee is steep but I think you must try it at least once if you are a coffee lover. Funnily enough the maple bacon donut was not my favourite, we both loved the double chocolate.  Service was excellent. Our server happily fulfilled our request to be seated on the patio should a table open. Other places get you gruff and eyerolls.  If you have a bad experience here...I don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto I would definitely come here often. The food was so good and filling and 1/2 off bubbly is a steal! We got a bottle of rosé bubbly. The only downfall with this resto was that the service was so slow and it was not even fully packed. There were some empty tables. I'm happy we didn't have to wait for a table. There's even some tables outside for those who want to soak up the sun.   My bro and I ordered the beastwich sandwich. It consisted of fried chicken thigh, pimento cheese, pork sausage gravy and a fried egg. So good and so filling! I'm not a sandwich girl but goddamn it was fantastic! The sandwiches come with a choice of salad and potatoes and I got half and half. The salad tastes strongly of ginger so if you don't like ginger just order the potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the mad maple sandwich (fried chicken thigh, beast bacon, ontario maple syrup, and fried egg). It was similar to the beastwich but sweeter. It was not too sweet at all though. I was worried it would be really sweet when I took a bite but it was pure awesomeness. However my boyfriend did say that each bite was not consistent and some bites had more maple than others."}
{"text":"After passing this restaurant many times, I decided to try Beast for dinner, despite reading the rave reviews about their brunch. The restaurant was very small with a cute patio outside and was as a perfect place for an intimate date night out.   What i liked about this place was that their menu was ever changing, using the freshest seasonal ingredients that were all sourced locally. We needed some help from our waiter to figure out what everything was on the menu since some stuff was a bit foreign to us but he was very knowledgeable and led us in the right direction on what to order. Everything on the menu was tapas/small sharing plates so we ordered 5 things to share between the two of us:  1. Warm marinated olives - came with three types of olives. Being a huge olive fan, I was surprised that I liked them with some heat (temperature)  2. Parker House rolls with pimento cheese - the rolls were super buttery and fresh out of the oven.   3. Esquites (mexican corn salad with trout) - Lots of great Mexican flavours, but if you do not like when a dish has too fishy of a taste, then I wouldn't recommend this dish.   4. Green Beans - with ricotta cheese, black beans and amazing lemony flavour. One of my favourites that I tried!  5. Poutine Fried Gnocchi - pasta was good but I expected cheese curds instead of regular cheese on top  6. Pork Hocks - Fried to perfection with amazing Asian flavours. No porky taste whatsoever! Highly recommend!    Overall we really enjoyed our meal. We definitely will be back again to try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"At the risk of being hyperbolic, this was frankly the best brunch I've ever had. I don't grant that commendation lightly. After a decade of brunching twice a weekend, I was blown away. I had Beast's meat egg scramble (meat of the day was ham) with spicy aioli, served with a biscuit and house fries. The ham tasted more like bacon (which I am FINE with), the aioli was the perfect compliment to the scramble, and the biscuit tasted something out of my grandmother's oven. My friends had bacon eggs Benedict and the breakfast sandwich. Both were served with salad. I've never before regretted ordering house fries over salad; today I did. The house fries were exceptional, but the house made dressing on the salad made me sad i wasn't eating vegetables- for the first time in my life.  The service was great and highly attentive. The patio was an oasis with ideal tree cover. The only complaint was with the shrieking child at the table next to us, but what can ya do...."}
{"text":"Came here for Friday night dinner.  Made resos so were seated quickly. The place actually didn't fill up so you could probably come here without reservations and get a small table without too much wait. Super cute and simple inside and looked like a great place for a few drinks and catching up.  Food for 2 of us: We shared the beastwitch (with egg), a brussels sprout with hummus and tahini dish, a curried tasting salomn poke, gnocchi poutine that was covered in a chicken and pea gravy and each got our own sticky toffee pudding for dessert. (we were stuffed after all this).  All the dishes were really delicious - especially the brussels sprouts and the beastwitch. I wasn't keen on the poutine gravy (pretty bland) and wish it was the pulled pork version or something more flavourful/hearty but the dish was still good. The toffee pudding was amazing and completely drenched in sweet sticky toffee. We probably should have shared one since it was like diabetes sweet but it also would have gotten really backwash-y with all that soupy toffee.  For the food and 2 beers each we each paid about $55 including tax and tip. Not bad at all for downtown Toronto standards.   The above + great services deserved 4.5 stars.  They get 3 because there was a d-bag party of 8 loud, obnoxious, a-hole guys there who were lost and thought they were in a sports bar and were yelling, slamming fists on the table, jumping out of their chairs \"yoooooooooo\" \"guyyyyyY!!!!!!\" \"whoaaaaaaaa\" \"dudddeeeee\" \"thats tightttttt\" \"thats so littttt yooooooo\"....the whole 9 for our whole f meal (they were seated just after we ordered).  Not the restaurants fault that classless morons came to dine, but it killed the vibe and since we could not hear each other over their frat boy yells it killed our conversations and night.  The servers really should have said something to them as their behavior was not acceptable for anything other than a bar or frat party, and we were not the only table put off by this. Another diner blatantly told them they were out of line and were ruining her night and to shut up. Other diners near by told us how annoyed they were. Every table in that place was giving stank face to this table (including the servers) yet....not a thing was done?!? Even if the servers acknowledged this to us and just said sorry it would have sufficed. The restaurant should have handled this better.  For me its about the whole experience, not just the food. And this experience was shiet."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and I had to put Beast on my itinerary. There are so many places to eat in Toronto, but this was the only place I knew of that has happy hour $1 oysters. I was pretty excited about trying this place out. Boy was King St congested on my way over here. Rush hour traffic for many, it took quite awhile to get here.  Happy hour from 5-7pm. $5 for beef heart in oyster aioli was okay. The poutine on the regular tapas menu was delicious. Not your typical poutine, they definitely kicked it up a notch with the gnocchi(potato dumpling) instead of fries.   Service was great and staff was friendly. Their menu changes weekly depending on seasonal ingredients. Great little place!"}
{"text":"Yes-yes-yes! The Beast may be the best local brunch gem I've ever found. Here's my brunch ranking for eggs Benny: Beast \ Average Joes \ Senator \ Eggspectation \ Aunties and Uncles \ Our Spot = Open Avenue Kitchen. The eggs Benny was perfectly cooked with an incredibly zesty salad and their house made potatoes and ketchup were spot on. It's worth the trek to the Bathurst and King area and we will be back! About $40 for 2 people, casual vibe, family and couple friendly with prompt service. Make the trip and brunch already!"}
{"text":"Solid food. Did the gnocchi poutine which was amazing. Fried chicken on a great biscuit. Couldn't have asked for better comfort food."}
{"text":"If you like meat, and aren't shy to try something beyond steak and \"Santa-Fe Chicken Wraps\", this is your spot. Tapas style plates of immaculate experiments in protein, served by cheerfully beleaguered staff. Do not expect machine like precision or a 45 minute lunch: this is a dinner to discuss and debate while you digest. Service is slow only because the place is constantly busy. Take the time and you'll be happy. Get wine. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Went here this week with a couple of friends for dinner. We arrived before 7, so we got to take advantage of their $5 drinks and snacks menu. Highly recommend doing this - it will save you about $4-5 on your glass of wine! Also the snacks are delicious. We really enjoyed the green onion pancake, caprese salad, and duck lettuce wraps.  We also ordered several plates for our meal. Highlights were the grilled broccolini (I swear it doesn't even taste like you're eating vegetables), the grilled prawns and peaches, and the sticky toffee pudding (It's impossible to not want to drink the leftover toffee sauce right from the bowl!).   Also want to give kudos to our server and chef who were extremely helpful with accommodating my nut allergies!"}
{"text":"This review is based on Beast version of Happy Hour: Beast120!  Wednesday to Friday from 5-7 pm with drinks and appetizer for $5 and oyster for $1 each!   We ended up sharing:  - chicken hearts + mole + pickled onions - quesadilla + chorizo + salsa verde - house cocktail- beast margarita - half a dozen of Oyster of the Day: Beach Angel, BC with House Made Beast pepper sauce  Everything was just so tasty! Chicken Hearts and Quesadilla both have really interesting complex flavour.  And the Oysters were just so fresh and sweet....and for a $1 each?! I would order a dozen oyster myself and wash them down with a glass of Cava next time!  Service was excellent as usual.   The menu changes every week so I definitely would be back again for Beast120!!! Great way to have a drink and a snack before dinner!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here! The courses were well portioned and not greasy. They get their meats from local farms and really do care about the quality of their food.  They have a pretty little patio that is great to sit in during the summer to people watch. The service was polite and efficient. Would definitely go back- and we didn't even go for their well known brunch! It is expensive, but worth it- very wholesome food."}
{"text":"Small place. Great food.   If you decide to come here, come in a small group. It took a while for our table of 4 to get in. We waiting out in the cold for about half an hour as there was no room indoors to wait. Food was delicious though. We had the crispy pigs ear to start and I had the Beastwich as my main. Worth the wait? Yes! It was a nice experience. Glad I can check this resto off my list of must-go places."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in the city. Enough said!  Pollo loco is so delicious it's hard to order anything else but everything I've had as been great"}
{"text":"I have been going to Beast periodically for their awesome $10 Friday lunch which it has always been good, except for one time when they had the chicken parmasian sandwich which oddly didn't have their usual creative or exotic spin on things and the sandwich was very heavy and lacked unique flavor. But it just one bad sandwich out of so many so I think it was just a fluke and doesn't change my opinion on Beast for lunch.  Last weekend I went for brunch and it was sooooooooooooooo good! It was the most perfect brunch as I was seated on the patio on a beautiful sunny mild day. Luckily I got there early enough so that I got seated outside without any wait. It's really nice being outside on a quiet residential street rather than the noise, traffic and dirt of a main street. I shared a sampling of a couple donuts which I think is a much have. The maple bacon donut was incredibly flavourful and the donut was fluffy with the right subtle amount of chewiness. The other donut I tried was the cardamom crueler which had a unique buttery taste with a nice mild spice to it, it was also really good. I had their French press coffee which made the donut starter experience even better.  Everything on the brunch menu looked so good. I had their breakfast sandwich which was grilled pork belly, fried egg, pickled onions, sweet and smoky mustard, lettuce on an apple fritter with home fries. The sandwich was good, but I thought it would taste more sweet and savoury. The homemade hot sauce and ketchup helped in adding some kick to this sandwich. I tried my friend's Beastwich which was fried chicken with cheese, egg and gravy on a buttermilk biscuit. It was really rich, but really good. I thought the meal with the donut starters was a good portion. I was really full and satisfied.       The service was really great. My server was very friendly, attentive and was great at explaining the menu. I found my new favorite neighourhood brunch place and will definitely be back to try their other dishes, however their menu changes constantly to suit what is local and in season so I will probably find myself there more often than expected."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me with the food that they're putting out! The \"poutine\" was probably the best version of poutine I've ever had. The Pork was delicious and the scallops were brilliant!"}
{"text":"The beastwich is insane. And good.   It's layer upon layer of good 'ol southern-style comfort food: biscuit, sausage gravy, fried chicken. Best with the orange, chunky hot sauce.   The food did take quite a while to come though. My stomach was literally tearing itself apart by the time our food arrived.  Beast is a tiny little place tucked in a converted house, so seats go fast. There is outdoor seating...but those seats go fast as well. So if you want a seat during weekend brunch, just get here fast."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a snowy and cold Saturday morning with a friend from out of town. We were seated right away when we walked through the door. Everything on the menu looked delicious, but my friend and I both decided on the Beastwich with 1/2 salad and 1/2 home fries on the side. We couldn't quite figure out what the dressing on the salad was but it was yummy! The Beastwich was also a bit overwhelming at first because it was so big, but I ain't complaining! Overall, food was excellent! Our server was great! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The beastwich!  Full of flavor and chicken is crispy, this enough to fill your appetite if you're extra hungry. Gravy is extra thick with sausage bits inside as well! Can't complain the nice addition of a fried egg in the middle as well.   We also had the pig ears (talk about being daring!) and it's crispy too. But I thought this was no special dish because the ears were a bit overfried and you'll hv to hv an appetite for pig hair because often times you'll see the hair on the fried ears. I don't think much plucking is done to get rid of the hair before they fry the ears.   We ordered the French toast with duck confit garnished on top. The French toast on its own tasted alright but it's the combo with the sweet and salty which makes this dish interesting. You don't find this kind of combination at a lot of brunch places so it's worth the try!  LAST TIP?!  It's usually super packed here so beware of the wait times!! Perhaps try holding your spot the day of and specify the time you're coming in fifteen minutes before so they can mark your name down before you arrive. They can't seat more than 8 ppl per party in the restaurant so be wary of that. They also can't seat you if your full party has not arrived! So take note of that too!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Waited almost an hour outside. They won't take a number and there isn't really a coffee shop or place to hang out near by. Doesn't really make sense for their location. They are in a residential area in a place that looks like a house. Cool atmosphere. Brought us hot coffee while we waited. Biscuit chicken was good, the rest of the dishes were surprisingly standard given the other glowing reviews on the site. I wouldn't wait an out for this place, but it was ok."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday morning brunch before a joke on the Humber River Trail.   I am glad that we got there when we did because as we got towards the middle of our meal, more groups were coming.   Our waiter was very nice. He had mentioned that he was still ew to the restaurant but he was very helpful.   I got the veggie scramble that came with a buttermilk biscuit. The food was really good. We also ordered the house donuts (strawberry, chocolate with coconut, lemon, and maple bacon).   I would defiantly return!"}
{"text":"Go here! Everyone's has to try this place. One of the best restaurants in the city. Perfectly portion tapas that allow you to try everything and be satisfied. You're obviously going to be sharing so try everything on the menu!   My favourite are the grilled prawns. The kaffir gives this dish a memorable kick! I'm drooling now just thinking about it. Really good quality and seasoned  bison carpaccio.    Cozy, good service and great food. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Previously, I enjoyed my brunch experience at Beast, so I was quite thrilled for an opportunity to return for dinner. Beast serves tapas-style small plates to share, so between the four of us (I dragged my family and my boyfriend along), we were able to try a good number of dishes.   Now onto the food!  The dinner started with some delicious bread baked in-house. The Parker House roll, in particular, was very buttery and satisfying.   Dirty rice balls ($5)- basically, these are arancini. The cheesy rice balls were piping hot and tasted delicious with the refreshing tomato sauce. We quickly gobbled all of it up. After the bread, this was a very good start to the meal.    \"Poutine\" of fried gnocchi, boar shoulder, cheese curds and creme fraiche ($11). The poutine is a permanent fixture on Beast's menu but the toppings change on a regular basis. I tried a version with Ontario water buffalo previously for brunch and really enjoyed it. This time around, the sauce had a completely different flavour profile- it almost tasted like a tomato sauce of some sort, rather than a meaty gravy. I think I prefer the first one that I had, but nevertheless, I still loved fried gnocchi for its crispy exterior and gooey, melt-in-your-mouth texture on the inside. Overall, this was another winner for me.   Southern sliders- tasso ham and pimiento cheese on english muffin ($15). These were fabulous! The mini burger was my favourite dish of the evening. The patty was bursting with juice and it's amazing how much flavour could be packed in such a tiny burger. On top of that, using english muffin as the bun was ingenious! I think the density of the english muffin worked particularly well on miniature burgers. On a side note, I did think that $5 per slider was a little pricey.  Ricotta dumplings with pine nuts, tomato sauce, eggplant pickle ($11). This was my least favourite dish of the meal. I was not a fan of the eggplant pickle, and I usually love eggplants! On the whole, the flavours just didn't work for me, and the ricotta dumplings had a strange texture that I didn't particularly enjoy.  Strip loin of beef with navy beans, quail egg and pickled watermelon rind ($15). I liked that the beef was already sliced, which made it easy for sharing. The quail egg, on the other hand, was hard to split. I found the pickled watermelon rind to be the most interesting component- it was a bright and refreshing contrast to the meat and beans.   Sweet potato wedges with pecans, maple vinaigrette, sultana raisins ($8). My mom and sister were put off by the liberal use of cinnamon, but I loved it! Cinnamon and sweet potato is a winning combination in my books, and I also loved the crunch from the pecans! I was more than happy to finish most of the dish.  Duck confit with braised red cabbage and plum mostarda ($13). The duck was cooked well and the skin was nice and crispy. My sister, who is very partial to duck, liked it a lot, but I always prefer duck prepared the Chinese way. Nevertheless, I actually liked the duck better than the beef.  Chocolate nut tart with coffee anglaise ($10). I loved it! The chocolate tart was rich and intense, perfect for dark chocolate lovers (like my boyfriend). I'm more of a white chocolate kind of girl, but I really loved that the deep chocolatey flavour was balanced out by the sweeter coffee cream sauce. The more bites I took, the more I liked it!  Sticky toffee pudding with toffee sauce and clotted cream ($10),This was the polar opposite of the chocolate nut tart- decadently sweet and gooey, the \"pudding\" cake was swimming in a bowl of molten caramel. My family loved this, and my sister was literally drinking the toffee sauce after all the pudding was devoured.  I really loved my meal at Beast (except for the ricotta dumpling), and I would love to go back for another meal, especially since they change their menu frequently."}
{"text":"Little tiny place but cute. I had the Challah french toast *without the duck* and Kashmiri Chai tea. I'm not a fan of having a bunch of toppings on my french toast because i don't like it to be soggy, but this was ok. I took some of the toppings off anyway.. lol Overall I like the place."}
{"text":"Im just annoyed. So I give this place... 3 stars.  We decided to go to the Beast on New Years day since there wasnt much to choose from as most places were closed. It was a snowy and cold day in toronto, and we had to wait outside in the windy cold for an hour for a table for 4.   When we were finally seated, we ordered:  the breakfast sandwich: i tried a bit of this and it was alright. The grilled pork belly was tender and flavourful. Nothing too special.  meat scramble: im not particularly a fan of scramble anything and this was not an exception. It just looked like a big mess on a plate. I might be a bit biased when it comes to scrambled eggs kind of things but this wasn't good.  the beastwich: buttermilk biscuit with fried chicken thigh and served with house potatoes. This was the best dish although still not the best fried chicken buttermilk biscuit I have had. The amount of gravy they put onto it made everything very mushy. The biscuit and fried chicken has mushed into one another by the time i finished a third of it.   The toffee pudding: After being served a salty and soggy breakfast, this pudding tasted GREAT! It was sweet but balanced off all the salt from our breakfasts. We split this into quarters - a quarter per person and it was enough. Another bite of it would have been too much sweetness.  I dont think Beast is worth lining up for if you have to wait out in the cold. If you are willing to wait over an hour for brunch...wait elsewhere - not at Beast. Soggy and salty brunch items are not worth waiting in line for.   Also, DO NOT wear a nice jacket to this place. It WILL smell like frying oil for a week after you brunch here."}
{"text":"Wow it was one of the best brunch we've had so far!! The food is so tasty! I couldn't get enough if it! It has a line up but totally worths waiting for it! I got a vegeterian benny and my friend ordered their famous  beastwich! We both were so happy about our food!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! We snagged a table on the front patio since the weather was great. From a gluten free standpoint, not a ton but the huevos rancheros were top notch. My sister orders a lot of huevos rancheros since it's usually GF friendly but these were definitely better than most. The corn tortillas would have not been GF as they normally are fried with other things but they didn't fry them at her request. For the non-GF folks, the Scott's anytime sandwich was great as was the walking in Memphis brisket sandwich. We also did a side biscuit with the sausage gravy but it the gravy wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I had a lovely, lovely experience at Beast a few days ago.  Superwoman heard about it from The Food Channel, I think, and invited me to try this place with her.  We arrived at about noon on Sunday and even though it was busy, we were able to snag a table right away.  Our server, I think his name was Jeff, was wonderful.  He was kind, courteous, knowledgable, attentive without being obtrusive, and really enthusiastic about the food but somehow really calm at the same time, LOL.    I ordered the Labatt 50 breakfast without the beer, with scrambled eggs and chorizo.  Superwoman ordered the Breakfast Sandwich.  My chorizo was deeelicious.  It was juicy, fragrant, spicy, paprika-y, and left a bright orange trail of oil on my plate, which I dipped my bread in.  So good!  And the scrambled eggs were scrambled just how I like them - there were bite-sized curds, so they weren't scrambled into a mushy pile like at many places.  And they were fluffy.  The potatoes on the side were spiced perfectly and delightfully crispy.  The bread was, well, nice.  The breakfast sandwich came with those awesome potatoes, and the sandwich itself was superb. I loved the sweet mustard it came with, though if it were me, I would've preferred to have more of it in the sandwich.  The pork belly was juicy but not fatty - cooked just right, and at just the right thickness.  The fried bun was also very fluffy and decadent.  I really like their in-house ketchup.  I think there's some kind of alcohol in it - who knew boozy ketchup would be so delicious?  I also really liked the orange hot sauce because it was full of spices.  The green hot sauce was a little too hot for me, though.  We ordered tea and coffee, which came in a pot and a French press respectively.  They also came with timers, which was a nice touch, although I felt that my tea should've steeped longer than what they set it to.    My tea was very nice, but that coffee was something else!  I'm not a coffee-drinker, but it was very delicious.  It was the Colombian, and I think it came from a boutique roaster.  It was very, very good, and I don't even like coffee.  Like it wasn't too raw, wasn't too smokey - it was roasted just right.  I also loved that it was served with raw sugar!   I mean, we originally raised our eyebrows at the price ($3 for tea and $4 for coffee) but we totally got it once it arrived.  Oh, and the staff was very kind, gracious, and quick to react when I spilled my entire cup of tea across the table and floor below me.  They even gave me a new pot, which was very nice.  When our bill came, I told Jeff we were looking forward to our next visit and he said he was too - so nice! We've already picked out what we'll have next. :)"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday recovery brunch, and were told the wait would be half an hour. The wait ended up being closer to an hour, which left us pretty hungry and kinda cranky. However, the hostess was considerably aloof and even sort of passive-aggressive, even though I'd like to think we were pretty patient throughout the process. And it wasn't just us, it was the rest of the couples and parties waiting as well. Not only that, the hostess fit in a party of 1 right before us on the list, which was sort of confusing, and when we asked her about it, she said that he came in before us, which definitely wasn't true. I think you should never fault a restaurant for being popular, but you can definitely fault a restaurant for having staff with unprofessional attitudes. Oy vey.  We eventually got seated, in a very bad mood, but thankfully, the food did a good job of improving our moods. We started off with the french press coffee and I got a freshly-squeezed orange juice, which slowly but surely got me into a less cranky mood. As for food, we ordered the the curry boar poutine with fried gnocchi instead of fries, peameal bacon benedict, and the Beastwich. The curry boar poutine was excellent, and the meat was a good contrasting texture with the crispy gnocchi. The curry provided a really nice depth of flavor, to be offset with the cheese, gravy, and scallions. Quite a nice, unique dish, and something I could eat a large vat of. The benedict was great, and the eggs were poached quite nicely. We felt pretty good about eating something that was uniquely Toronto, and they executed quite nicely. The Beastwich was just a magnificent feat of richness, with a nicely fried chicken thigh smothered with pork sausage gravy, between a really nice buttery biscuit. You definitely have to fork and knife it, because if you try to pick it up with your hands (as I did), you'll have sausage gravy dripping from your hands forever. The potatoes that came with both dishes were crispy and had just the right firmness. Potatoes or home fries are something that many brunch places can't make consistently weirdly enough, but Beast is not one of those places.  The service in general just wasn't very friendly or effective. It seemed like everyone was really frantic and stressed out, but it wasn't like they were working very fast. It took them about 10 minutes to clear tables, even though they were moving around the restaurant at a frenetic pace. Quite confusing. The prices are pretty reasonable for brunch, with dishes at around $10-15.  In all, we really did enjoy the food and have no complaints there, but we just didn't really enjoy the vibe or the level of service enough. I'm inclined to give this place another shot, simply because the food is pretty filling and delicious, but the service, in general, certainly didn't do this place any favors. Perhaps we came in on an off day, but it just wasn't a good look for the staff."}
{"text":"Sumptuous sophisticated food, without the pretense.  Arrived on a Thursday evening w/ my Dinner Club crew after hearing about this place from my cousin and the reviews from the good people on Yelp.  8PM reservations were made a couple days beforehand over their voicemail and I appreciated the call back to confirm the reservation as well as the reminder today.  The restaurant is a small quaint space in King West.  Seating is probably limited to no more than 40 guests, but this evening was substantially quiet - maybe b/c it being St. Patrick's day or just a quiet weeknight.  The waitress was great; unobtrusive and attentive, and gave great suggestions when asked.  The food itself took a bit of time from order to service, but obviously because all the dishes were made fresh to order and definitely all worth the wait.  One thing to note, is that she did suggest that we order about 2-3 dishes per person.  Seemed a bit overkill but I think we all averaged about 1.5 dishes each, and ended up quite satiated and satisfied.  I ordered a poutine to start (and share) ($10) served with large chunks of elk hip meat, crisp gnocchi and creme fraiche.  I've never had elk before, so this was a real treat.  The meat was incredibly tender and had a really savoury flavour profile that just melts and lingers on your taste buds.  The crisp gnocchi was also a surprising twist taking the role of the potato in this concoction.  All in all, a delectable dish.  The main I had was the full serving of the duck confit ($25) which a half serving would have sufficed ($16).  The half order is basically the serving of the thigh, while the full order is the entire leg.  This was served over a bed of sweet potato with bacon and preserved lemon.  Amazing.  Quite honestly....amazing.  That's all I really need to say.  To finish off, I ordered a single scoop of the house made apple sorbet ($3).  Ice cream, gelato and sorbet are my achilles heel when it comes to desserts, and this was definitely not a disappointment.  Freshly turned out, the texture was silky smooth and had an unbelievable taste of apple.    Overall I had my reservations in it being a bit pricey, but the money here was definitely well spent.  Next reservation will have to be for brunch.  I have my eye on that beast benny. ;)"}
{"text":"Beast is an adorable little restaurant disguised as a house on Tecumseth Street. I've only been here for brunch and it was amazing. I got the huevos rancheros and BF got the challah French toast with duck confit on top. Both amazing!!! We also didn't have to wait that long for a table despite it being Sunday brunch because we decided to be early birds that day :) we each got a 4 dollar coffee that came in individual French presses with a timer. Really neat concept but not worth 4 dollars, that's more than Starbucks!!!   We loved beast and would love to return whether it's brunch or dinner. I've heard their dinner menu has some pretty adventurous items so I'd love to see what's in store."}
{"text":"Why!! They have lineups, it's a very small restaurant that seats about 20-25 people. Lineups for 2 can take about 30 minutes, and this is a \"brunch\" restaurant? By the time we WANT brunch, it means we want it asap!!   As you can see, Beast has never been my choice for breakfast or brunch... I'm too hungry to wait! But on our way to ANY breakfast restaurant (10:30am Sunday) we saw no lineups and dropped in, I finally understood why everyone raves about it. The food is deeeeeliciouss and unique -it's not the typical egg/toast.  challah french toast: topped with duck confit and cranberry mostarda $13 - That's right! French toast and duck confit!! So amazing and LOADED with duck meat  crab cake benedict: two poached eggs and hollandaise on an english muffin $15 - What a wonderful blend of flavours!!!   We didn't have a nice waitress, but all other staff were fantastic.  UPDATE: $5/apps 5-7pm and $2/oysters, super delicious deal!! the pork belly tacos are amazing  (sometimes Yelp doesn't display my photos, so here they are!!)  pork belly https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/beast-toronto?select=Z_pH9fsLoLHKl4l9PIKUJg  tartare of the day https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/beast-toronto?select=E5xz-B1xpdCx7wGVyPXGZA  patatas bravas https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/beast-toronto?select=pvU1lHKmsO19hd7wcsrDGA"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food.  We got the poutine tater tots, roasted brussels sprouts, pork hocks, and beef cheeks for appetizers.  For main, we got 3 of the biscuit sandwiches - two memorable ones were Beastwich and mad maple.    All of the food was amazing and the place wasn't overly crowded.  Definitely one of my favorite meals of my short stay in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Beast means hardcore brunching.  After waiting about half an hour, my group of 5 got a really nice table outside in some shade. I just love the neighborhood-y feel. We felt like we were sitting in someone's garden.  Our waitress was chill, sarcastic, and had great recommendations. She also kept our boozy brunch glasses filled.  The menu isn't busting at the seams, but it still was very challenging for each of us to pick something since everything was unique and sounded delicious. It's definitely chicken heavy, but there are enough non-meat options, as well.  I got the Bruce Leroy, which was an Asian rendition of a chicken and biscuit dish (included kimchi!). The combination was great, and the ingredients were cooked very well. I wish I had taken a photo, too, because the presentation was lovely.   The challah French toast was a little divisive at our table. It included a hunk of duck confit, cranberry, creme fraiche, and syrup ($14). I loved the combination myself, and the duck was nice and not too dry. The sweet and salty combo was definitely quite unique."}
