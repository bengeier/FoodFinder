{"text":"A exceptional patisserie in Toronto.  Patrick is the owner and master baker directly from France. He is a local favourite and his products are truly masterpieces.  The croissants and danishes always seem to sell out fairly quickly. He also has some prepared foods, and delicious desserts all made in-house. Very satisfying, and superb value for the quality you get.  Patrick and his team of bakers work hard to deliver exceptional results."}
{"text":"Very disappointing; bakery was selling mango sponge and mousse cakes claiming to be fresh, yet they were clearly previously frozen. Quality has gone down over the years."}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere with a few tables, has a shelf of homemade jams, soups etc. that I am always curious about because people's inspiration can come from the most obscure places and now it's in your hands. This place has more high end desserts that are clearly more intricate in terms of execution and very appealing to the eye. They know it's important to cleanse your palette when you're indulging in different flavours, so there's a self serve water station which is something so small, but I always appreciate."}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem!  The best french bakery in the entire city.  Their croissants are the only ones outside of France that I will indulge in, their macaroons are light and their breakfasts are superb.  Oh and the Madeleines!  That fresh lemon taste is to die for."}
{"text":"This place is a much better option than the coffee shop in the plaza, considering they make their own menu items.  I would also classify this place as \"Quebec Revival\", as opposed to authentically French.  They have many products Quebecers will be familiar with, such as Tourtiere (meat pies).  Really reminds me of a lunch counter you would find in Quebec city.  You can be served in french here, if you so choose.  Several of the people working here speak french, though they hire a few locals to work the cash and serve customers.  The service is very friendly and casual.  The place is really *crushingly* tiny, and has only seating fr 4-6 people inside.  Plan on eating elsewhere if you arrive in the morning or lunch hour busy times.  Hopefully this is the summer time, and there a few extra tables outside.  The mains rotate depending on the day, but you can count on a strong home-made feel to any dish here, things like stew or shepherd's pie will be common.  You can count on good croissants and pastries with decent levels of butter (not really Parisian-level though).  And they are open to taking orders for most any kind of custom cake or casserole for you to take home for those family functions where you'd rather not cook.  So far, no one mentioned that this is the place you want if you are craving some real Québec Tourtiere !  These meat pies are a tradition in winter months, especially on the holidays and you can get a slice or buy them frozen at Ma Maison, along with several other products Québecers will be familiar with, like Creton."}
{"text":"Highway robbery on Dundas West!  Slow service. Employees seem terrified by the owner.  Prices not posted anywhere. They should because this place is pricy. Get ready to be surprised at the cash!  Might be a french bakery, but why the french attitude?"}
{"text":"Based on take out cake I would come back to this spot again.  Space is tight and the food choices seemed decent. The selection of fruit tarts was decent and they all looked appetizing. We were here for cake pick up and we got two. The chocolate layer cake was very good and that alone is worth the detour. The other cake was OK and didn't quite do it for moi. Anyway will be back if I am in the area.  4 Stars."}
{"text":"Passed by this place while driving and finally had to give it a try.  The staffs are friendly and they speak French and English.   For the longest time I almost gave up on finding amazing croissants in Toronto. My favourite croissants has that flakey crispy melt in your mouth feeling. I can find them in France but also in Montreal. Before I found Ma Maison I used to go to Crema for croissants and latte but since ma Maison is close to the studio where I work I decided to give it a try.   The croissants are gooooood!! My favorite is the plain one and the almond chocolate one. They also serve good coffee and latte. Their breakfast croissant is amazing as well wih scrambled eggs tomato and bacon for only $5.75. Very reasonable, they also serve a lot of hot food but I am a bit hesitant for now since the prices for those are on then higher end. If the other items were cheaper this place would be given 5 stars. Location could also be better since it's in a strip mall. However I think this place would have line ups or could be way too busy if it was in a different location so I kinda like it as it is like my secret croissant getaway!"}
{"text":"The staff here honestly make the experience. I went here to grab something for lunch today and was so pleased with my experience. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I wasn't sure what to get but the staff were quick to answer my questions. I asked what was in the quiche and a woman told me there was cheese and bacon. I mentioned that I'm a vegetarian and she quickly offered me the vegetable quiche. I ended up getting it and it was delicious. The food here is pricey but the quality is reliable and the staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here on a hunt for macarons and I was disappointed. They were nowhere in sight so I had to ask for them which made me a bit nervous. I got each of the different flavours available and I found that most of them tasted very similar. Pricing was standard $25 for a dozen but it wasn't worth it at all"}
{"text":"First time on Saturday 815. Small spot; pastries all looked great. Picked up a couple of regular croissants a chocolate an apple gallate a breakfast sandwich bacon egg on a croissant and a cappuccino. Friendly service. Croissants were so fresh. One if the best around. Cappuccino good. There are prepared foods maybe next time. Parking lot in small strip mall. A few tables in and out."}
{"text":"my review is primarily based on customer service not really on the quality of the food. i purchased a whole tray of bread pudding for a company function. i understand it was pretty good as far as taste goes but one of my members attending the function bit into a stone and broke a tooth when biting into some bread pudding. he was more than a little upset for sure. i took the stone and tray (that i borrowed) to the store and spoke to someone in charge and explained that someone broke a tooth on a stone that was in his bread pudding. the manager offered me half of a shrug, barely an apology and \"did i want a single serving of cake to go\" i said \"so that's it?\" he said \"well what do you want me to say\" and so i will never be back. i hold these functions monthly and would happily get food there again as it is close to my house/job but not ever again. customer service is crummy!!"}
{"text":"Good news: a delightful breath of French air in the heart of heartless Etobicoke. Bad news, they don't post the prices, leaving good faith customers feeling played at the cash register. Not cool guys."}
{"text":"Lots of people rave about the french bakery spots Bonjour Brioche, Frangiapane, Clafouti, Patachou and Pain Perdue but my fav spot around town is Ma Maison (located at 4243 Dundas St. W - Royal York, across from the Bruno's plaza).  I work across the street and for the first few months at my office I frequented Java Joe's for my double Americano until it finally twigged I was on the wrong side of the street.  I ventured in to Ma Maison and have never stopped going.    The croissants, in particular the Almond croissant are absolute aorta chokers.  Bread pudding is stellar as are all the fruit danishes, the madelines and the mini brioche buns.  Prepared foods available to eat in (there are about six tables) are incredible.  From cedar planked salmon to a Leek & Lobster quiche (you can pick a main and a side, prices range $6.50-$9.00).  Mains vary from day to day.  Side choices include things such a Wheatberry Salad, Glass Noodle Salad to creamy mashed potatoes.  Daily soups are also available.  The pastry case is homage to true French pastry with the clafouti styled tartes to the apple tartin.  There is a take home cooler with boil in bags of such things as salmon with bok choy and veggies to Duck Confit.    Chef/Owner Patrick Alleguede is a traditionally trained chef who lives,eats and breathes the french cuisine commitment.  His true speciality though is charcuterie and his pates and terrines are delicious.  Be ready for a wait.  Service is sloooooooooooow.  There seems to be an often large turnover in his counter staff which I think had more in part to do with his wife working behind the counter.  I have found her to be about as warm as an iced cappucchino but Patrick more than makes up for it.  Prices are stiff, this ain't a cheap take out place and servings are tiny but you do get absolutely stellar quality.  As well I noticed they posted a note in the shop about not using any food which has production in China.    By the way, you can buy the croissants frozen, proof them yourself over night and bake them at home.  I did this for Christmas day, serving them at brunch, along with one of Patrick's unbelievable quiches and my family & guests practically worshipped me.   Great spot for a morning coffee and a basket with a big hunk of baguette, jam & butter."}
{"text":"It's just the beginning, of the end. This USED to be one of my favourite places!!! But new owners don't have a grasp on the business. Arrived at 11am to an almost empty shop, no customers, no product available. The neatly dressed, polite, smiling, french-speaking female employees, have been replaced with sloppy looking young guys, who look afraid, and their new male Filipino boss hovering over everything, or should I say hovering over 'nothing' -!as there was NOTHING available to buy. How do u run out of baked goods, and croissants, at 11am, at a BAKERY!!! So sorry, I'm not coming back. There was a stream of people going in, and leaving, empty handed, and sharing the same comments. The fun, French European vibe and ambience is gone."}
{"text":"Desserts fair Sad sad sad looking deli, dull dry smoked  Salmon ;slightly crusty ' aged' mayo pea carrot salad Middle East ersatz salad and perfect combo tired sliced cuke with garlic( the perfect foil )salad. Etobicoke idea of ' French''Take out'. Frightening."}
{"text":"Pastry is well done customer service is very attentive and consistent. If you go on a Saturday morning be prepared to wait as service can be slow.  The only downside is the coffee very bitter and poorly extracted."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Ma Maison!  It's the cutest little place with not only French pastries but lots of premade food such as cabbage rolls, boeuf bourguignon, roast chicken, tilapia filets, coq au vin, etc.  On Fridays, they have pizza which would rival some of the best pizza joints out this way.  One of personal favourites is their chocolate croissants - it's like heaven on earth!  My colleague and I went one day to grab some lunch and decided to pick up some danishes and croissants to take back for our other colleagues.  They too were in heaven and said that the croissants were the best they've tasted in their lives!  It's true French cuisine at its finest."}
{"text":"This review is based on the atmosphere, location, & a chocolate croissant.  More a café than bakery, all the items are tucked away, behind glass - even the croissants.  No macaroons were in sight during my visit.  Ma Maison is located in a small strip plaza, with limited parking, on a weird, non-residential strip of Dundas.  Most of their traffic is probably from people driving.  Since I was testing out croissants today - Patisserie Saint Honoré missed out since it's closed for renos?? - I opted for a chocolate croissant.  It was quite average with 1 small tiny dollop of chocolate in the middle.  Pastry could've used another fold as there weren't that many layers to it.  Have definitely had better elsewhere!  Due to location, café itself doesn't wanna make you sit there and enjoy your caffeinated beverage/pastry.  This place may do better elsewhere, but the view from the window is yet another strip mall with mainstream stores."}
{"text":"Exceptional bakery and cafe! Someone from my company brought in a box of croissants from this place and it was amazing. Their homemade jams are perfect croissant stuffers. My wife and I went in one afternoon and had their crepes, which were fresh and delicious. Brings back memories of our trip to Paris."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the amount of garage lined up along the back wall outside of the restaurant where customers park their cars. No screen on back door which is left open to the kitchen. Noticed a rat infestation as a result of the garbage. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love love this bakery/cafe! They have amazing baguettes and a few times for wine and cheese nights, we have hit up this bakery for their delicious and very affordable baguettes. My husband and I have also come in for breakfast and our morning coffee on the weekends. Their French pastries are amazing. Definitely recommend their croissants and berry pastries. They also have fancier French desserts, macaroons and cakes, some of which we have sampled. Very rich cakes with beautiful presentation. Their cappuccino is decent too. I've yet to try some of their savoury goods, but everything in Ma Maison looks absolutely delicious! Definitely one of our go to spots!"}
{"text":"What a delight! I have driven by this shop for years, always promising myself I'd check it out. Very surprising interior, very french and cozy and lovely. We tried coffee and pastries - all very tasty and worth returning for. The baguette was crusty, fresh and delicious. Much better than average. They had prepared foods to take home as well as eat-in meal options. A great little find."}
{"text":"It's always pleasant to be greeted in French. Bonjour !  Madam offers a cafe of deliciousness, a hidden gem of French delight to eat in or take out. I wish I had a cafe like connected to my house so to always have access to their food. I had the lady make a smoked salmon sandwich special order just for me with a side of cucumber salad.  $11 with tax and the food comes with better service than a Parisian cafe."}
{"text":"This is one great little French cafe. There isn't much room but the food is delicious. They have a pretty large variety for a small place.  Their croissants and baguettes are exactly like the ones in France.  Went with a colleague and had a breakfast croissant - fluffy scrambled eggs and bacon inside with some parsley. The service is fast.  Usually very crowded on the weekends.  Will post photos the next time I go. I ate too quickly."}
{"text":"I had to order an egg free, dairy free cake for my daughter who was turning one and is allergic to those two things.  The chef at Ma Maison was able to come up with a recipe that did not contain those two ingredients.  Not only was he able to accommodate our special needs, he did not charge me extra for it.  I called their restaurant to request a copy of their catering menu by email and it was promptly sent to me.  Excellent, excellent service.  I should also mentioned that the cake was delicious.  The baby certainly enjoyed it."}
