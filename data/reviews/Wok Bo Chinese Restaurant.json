{"text":"These guys always treat me right. Food is always done when they say it'll be done, I've never had to wait when i go in and pick up. And i don't know why everyone has really high expectations for a small shop like this. Especially considering that the other parts of the building are emptied out. Just get your Americanized Chinese food and leave. No one forced you eat at their restaurant, you chose to go there yourself."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  The ONLY reason we order from them is because they deliver.  Most of the time we tolerate their food if for the grace of god they get our order correct.  2 out of the last 3 times we've ordered they have screwed up our order.  It takes them normally over an hour to get our food to us.  The most recent horrible experience I order the Shrimp Chow Mein.  My order came without the crunchy noodles.  So all i had was a pile of lettuce soaked in some liquid with shrimp.  I called and complained and the lady that answered said the next time I ordered she would give me an extra bag of crunchy noodles.  I told her I might not order this again next time.  Then she offered a free drink.  We don't go there in person we only order.  I wasn't going to take a free coke for them messing up my order.  I told her how about you knock $5 off our next order.  The lady refused.  Don't waste your time.  They don't care how crappy their service is.  Take the extra time and drive to Red Bowl or a better restaurant.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are great. Everything else was ugh. I had the shrimp with broccoli which by the way was mostly broccoli and the rice tasted like pool water. Never again!!"}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. The  food is trash. Like everyone said it's no taste or very bland. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say I actually gave this hole in The wall a chance !!! Their  sanitation score was way  below average  93 !!! Me being positive I gave them a chance !! Thinking most hole in the wall places have the best food .... THIS WAS NOT THE CASE !!  The food was Bland not tasteful at all I had to recook the fried rice  I'm so upset with myself !! Never again"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings and mei fun!!!! Reasonable prices always hot and fresh when I leave there"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!!!This place is the worst,  I usually get it delivered but after going in there tonight and waiting for almost 30 minutes for crappie chinese food it will definitely be the last...First off the place is so dirty I honestly don't know how it passed any inspection, speaking of which looks like they changed the grade to 94 with a marker . I always felt like the lady taking  the orders was kind of rude but after watching her with my own eye's hang up on customer's and answer every call with a attitude  I knew I wasn't wrong. They have a broken refrigerator at the front of the restaurant without a door and can sodas and case's of can sodas just sitting in there dirty and hot. Once again I don't know how they pass inspection.  My 13 year old pointed out a comb and a hair pic in one of the plants beside the broken refrigerator looked like they had been there for years. ........The phone never stopped ringing for those deliveries from nearby hotel's but I bet if they saw it up close they would turn away. It doesn't even deserve one star but it won't let me move forward without it."}
{"text":"I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.  Also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average. I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I would strongly tell anyone I know not to order from there either."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. It is convenient to me and while not great, it at least, was decent Chinese take-out. Well I don;t know what happened but it is certainly no longer decent. We ordered dumplings, chicken wings, crab rangoon, spring roll, egg roll, orange beef, and hot and sour soup. Nothing was good. It all had a funny taste, nothing was cooked right, the orange beef was soggy, gummy and tasted bad, egg rolls were soggy and had a strange cinnamon sweet kind of taste, Spring roll was terrible, hot and sour soup was neither, and the crab rangoon was limp Nothing had much flavor and the flavor that did exist .was just weird. I don't know what happened to the chicken wings because they used to be great, now they are heavily battered in a tasteless thick soggy batter.  Needless to say we won;t be back and if you are smart you won't be either."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Maybe because they deliver is why they seem so busy but the food is bland. My wife had to come home and recook the fried rice. There's no flavor to anything thank god for soy sauce I wouldn't ever consider this place an option. Unless your looking for directions don't go."}
{"text":"We found this place in our hotel book. Thankfully we decided to drive to the restaurant instead of ordering takeout. We went to sit down and my mom noticed a huge cockroach under the table. The refrigerator had no door. And there were boxes stacked up on tables and all over up against the walls in the restaurant. Needless to say we got out quick!! Glad we saw the condition of the place before we ordered any food. This place should be closed down. Feel so sorry for all the people ordering takeout but have no idea where their food is coming from."}
{"text":"we order delivery from here at least once a week, the food is good and the delivery is better :) i love the cashew chicken...mmm..and shrimp egg rolls... sweet and sour chicken is also very tasty! love the fried wontons and chinese doughnuts...yum! :)"}
