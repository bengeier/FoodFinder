{"text":"Decided to give them another try but yet I was still disappointed ... I called in for a pick up order of kimchi tofu with beef. Once i got my order I noticed that I didn't received any side orders and my sister said that they usually fill up the container with the tofu soup but it was only half and they got my order wrong I had asked for beef but got pork instead and its was that busy so I do u understand how they could of forgot my sides or order wrong. I was in a rush so I couldn't say anything. I guess I'll just have to make the drive out to Hodori which is half an hour away since they never seem to disappoint me"}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because food was very good, but they need to get their service together. And while some food was great for the party, some was only fair. 2 of us got the Scottsdale KBBQ dinner. It was awesome. I got the shrimp KBBQ. It was very good. But no rice, sauce or anything was offered or served with it. Husband got E8. Should have been great. Showed up warm, not hot. Sent back and came back hot but bland. Sushi we ordered earlier was very good. So, review is mixed. Get service down (lots of empty plates piled up) and get all food consistent like the Scottsdale dinner, and u have a 4-5 star place."}
{"text":"I've been 2x  since this place opened, and although the food is fabulous,  the service is seriously lacking. We ordered 3 dishes,  beef, chicken and shrimp,  and after reminding the waitress of our waters to start,  the food, which we cooked ourselves on the tabletop grill, took almost an hour. We spent 2 hours there,  and 1 in our party was late getting back to work  I'm sad because I like the food but the service is just brutal."}
{"text":"Good choice for a late night restaurant, I had the Yakisoba for 11.95  They have AYCE Sushi and Korean BBQ as well, I put the prices on my photos"}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday night and got the all you can eat korean BBQ and sushi special for 4 people.  Definitely do not recommend the all you can eat deal, it is not worth the money.  On top of that they had horrible customer service, mediocre food and a laundry list of rules and regulations for their all you can eat special.     They also don't follow yelp rules by enticing customers to leave 5 star reviews and get a free dessert.  So they definitely have a bias yelp profile!"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ and Sushi in town! The service is great and you can't beat the price. Plus they have large portions and the bento box lunch special is amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't write no more because I fell in love with this place. And I came here to think of my hometown. Thank you Ohya !"}
{"text":"Slow service. Difficult to get orders completed. If you are looking for attentive service i do not recommend. However Food quality was overall good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. That's the only positive thing I have to say about this establishment. Customer service was horrible, wait time for my \"all you can eat Korean bbq and sushi\" was ridiculously long, and apparently we have to wait until all the Korean bbq is off of our table before we can order another plate, (which increased  the wait time even longer because we needed to wait for the food to cook). We also had only 4 people at our table, but they added gratuity on top of our bill (their policy says five or more people). Spend your hard earned money someplace else. I know I will."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to the valley for a couple day getaway and I was craving Asian cuisine. Originally just came here because they had a great Groupon running for sushi. The ambiance is so cheerful and welcoming, I love the beautiful tree in the center of the restaurant. The food was delicious and just what I was hoping for. Large portions! We had the firecracker appetizer- crab cream cheese jalape√±o.... amazing. We would come back just to see our server Simon. He was so kind and attentive! We had many questions and he was so patient. He was the best part of our first time here!"}
{"text":"It's cool that they have both KBBQ and Sushi, and both with pretty high quality. The place is super clean and the service is great. I want to try their all you can eat next."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to for ramen, sushi, and sake bombs. Tiffany takes great care of me everytime I eat here. The ramen and firecrackers are my favorite thing on the menu, not to mention the amazing sake bombs on happy hour!!! Best spot for sake and ramen in the valley."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past Saturday. Food was AWESOME!!  Loved it. Reasonable prices and great service. We had a fairly large group. Had the BBQ Bulgaogi, Bibimbap, couple of noodle dishes, couple of sushi rolls, etc. everyone was stuffed and even our picky eaters loved it. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Very big and clean. Awesome good!!! Me Kealoha pumehana. Totemo gozu!!!! Kirei"}
{"text":"I have tried this place 4 times trying to give it a chance every single time, hoping it would get better.  There's not that much Asian restaurants in the Scottsdale area and I'm rooting for it to succeed but it's not.  It's just getting worse.    Service:  Service at this place is just awful.  The owner doesn't know how to staff the restaurant accordingly.  It's a Sunday night so the restaurant is not busy at all.  There were 6 tables taken.  We were seated by the hostess, it took over 10 mins for the server to acknowledge us and get us water. Then it took her another 15 mins to get back to us to get our order.  It was about 40 mins after being seated when we got our ramen order.  As the server delivered our ramen, she tells my friend, \"The spoon should be in there.\"  Why yes, the spoon was inside the soup.  She didn't return with a brand new, dry spoon.  Her expectation was for my friend to dig into the soup, find the spoon, then use the same wet spoon.   Food:  All three of us ordered ramen.  The noodles were clearly frozen, then heated in hot water then you add the broth so it's over cooked.  The ramen weren't even separated. It was all scrunched up. The sushi chef was on point though. His rolls were really good.   Now, it's definitely not the servers or the cooks fault.  They are not given the proper tools and training to do their job correctly.  There was one server running around trying to get everyone.  There was the hostess but she didn't help the server even get us the water for our table.  I really hope this place gets better with their service."}
{"text":"Good food but horrid service. No hostess and no bartender and the bar is huge. Staff scattered and no team work. Ordered a savignon blanc and got a red wine. Had to ask for water. HAD TO ASK FOR THE SIDE DISHES AFTER the main dishes came. HAD TO ASK FOR RICE!!!! Never ever go here if you are a fan of Korean food. SHAME on the management for not educating and training your staff,"}
{"text":"Been there several times with the family. The all you can eat on Wednesday is worth it if you are a big eater. The Galbi is tasty. Their Bachan is great! Wife and kids ordered some sushi and was to their liking. Service is a bit slow which is reason why it's not a 5star along with them nagging you about \"if you don't eat everything I'll have to charge you full price\". Other than that if you are looking for Korean food in Scottsdale you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"8 of us went for all you can eat sushi and BBQ and it was Hot Hot Hot...but in the bad Arizona summer kind of way and it was hard to get past the sweating to enjoy the food. Dear Management, crank up and retrofit the a/c! Two stars because it's almost unbearable around the cooktops and under the vents.   Food was good and prolific, with the exception of the little side dishes  that were way too little and insipid. You have to ask for everything except water. Lettuce wraps were nonexistent because we didn't know to ask for them. Ask for your ALYCE menu so that you can mark it for your next round.  The sushi is OK for all you can eat and there are lots of choices. Ditto for the BBQ. So, if you have an appetite and it's winter, head this way with less qualms."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, and a lot of fun for our family night out.  Bbq and small plates just like I remember from Korea."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service, will come back again!!  Good ice cream too :-)  Groupon for Mayo location   Thank you"}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times because Korean food calls out to me sometimes and I don't feel like driving 45 minutes to a decent place. But I think this place just needed some time to get its legs, because this most recent visit the food was pretty solid. The highlight was the service and the server Lisa who was very responsive. You need to ask for help on Asian restaurants IMO.   Give it a try. Not LA yet but better than anyone in the 30 mile radius."}
{"text":"This is my second time and definitely not the last time dining at Ohya Scottsdale.  The servers were very attentive and food was delicious. I've been waiting for a Korean restaurant in North Scottsdale. Looking forward to introducing my friends to Korean food! It has a great bar too!"}
{"text":"Visited here last week, great with groups and couple. Hardly find a All you can eat kbbq around, has to drive 30 mins for here. The kbbq has fresh great meat, love the short rib eyes. Decent size. No so much with the sushi. The limitation is 2 pieces of sushi each person per order. The roll we ordered is a bit soggy, all dipped in sause. They took way too long to wait as well, might as well order kbbq only. The waitess is nice, but short of help. Cant handle table request in time. It is a bit smoky in the restaurant, can cause coughing at the beginning. But still, very limited kbbq all you can eat store around. Worth it every once a while!"}
{"text":"I typically go to the location off Thunderbird on the West side but decided to try out this location with a friend for lunch. I'm so in love with the atmosphere! We were seated beneath a cherry blossom tree with lovely lanterns. It was nice to see something so pretty but not be outside in the heat haha they have a huge variety of rolls jere, some that the other location does not have. They seem very true to the classics here but daring enough to try new things. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when making selections. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about their AYCE Sushi and Korean BBQ on Wednesday nights, so the family and I were all excited to go. We go all the time to similar establishments in LA and San Diego, so we had high hopes. FINALLY! One right here by North Scottsdale! The place was nice and clean - liked the tree in the middle of the room. Sushi was on point, and that was all my son would eat anyway. The BBQ meats were ok for the price, we pay about the same when we go to Koreatown in LA. And they were marinated pretty good.  The BIG difference? The service. OMG. We have never been to a Korean BBQ establishment THIS SLOW!!! The water was slow, the sushi was slow, the sides were slow, and the meats ... my husband was joking maybe they were still trying to catch the cow at the back. Maybe they were understaffed - our server was really nice, she just looked harassed. We had to put in our next order as soon as the first tray was brought to our table. Otherwise, you sit around and twiddle your thumbs, singing Merry Christmas in your head.   We will still go back - we can only go to Manna in San Diego once a year after all. But I really hope the next time we hit their AYCE on Wednesday nights, we don't have to wait forever for our orders to come in."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but I just couldn't.     I love the food at the Glendale location and the service there was fine.  The ambiance here is much better; it's a beautiful set-up, however I cannot get past the poor service!  Our waiter accidentally spilled a tray of accoutrements on the floor while taking our menus and that didn't get cleaned for at least another 20 minutes.  We were served an extra set of seasoning for the whole table, but only one set of sides for half the table.  Our plates weren't cleaned at all during the meal, until he waiter needed room for our desserts.  There was no explanation for the meal at all, which was needed for half the table.  We were celebrating a birthday so we ordered all of their desserts, but the cheesecake we ordered came out frozen solid.  I still tipped them 18% because we were a big party, but doing so was painful.  I really hope they improve.  Maybe with some training of their waitstaff, and improvement of dessert, things will get better.  I'll keep my fingers crossed and keep reading reviews because we need more establishments like this in the valley."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and service is always good but the food takes forever. It's never full when I stop by, maybe 4 tables and always 2 servers. I don't know much about Korean BBQ but maybe the food prep takes longer for some reason but for sushi I've waited about 20 minutes for 1 roll. I don't blame the servers because it's not their fault and they are always so nice. Cassie and Kyle are my favorite servers. Both friendly and make you feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Good grief! Where do I begin?  Ever since moving to Phoenix from LA, I've been on a hunt for a good AYCE Kbbq -- something that I've been spoiled with in K-town of LA or ANYWHERE in California. I understand I cannot find something that great here in the entire Maricopa County, so I needed to lower my standards a bit. So fine, I did.   Went here for dinner on a Friday evening -- wasn't busy. That was great. My girlfriend and I decided we can't pass up AYCE Korean + Sushi ($26) and that's what we had. We ordered the LA Galbi, Bulgogi, and another one I forgot because it was that awful. Their bulgogi tasted like it was marinated with the regular Shin Ramyun packet or Ramen powder packet -- c'mon! I ordered a sushi roll too, but I totally forgot what it was called because it was also that bad. 30 minutes later, our order came out. 10 minutes after our order came out, the albacore nigiri I ordered came out. 10 minutes. For one piece. It wasn't a work of art. WHY?! Fine... that was fine. The side dishes that came out was woeful -- a tiny platter of kimchi. So yes, it's normal that my girlfriend, a kimchi fiend, would ask for more... except that never came out. Ever. That was the tipping point. Customer service here is just as bad as their food.   See ya never, Ohya!"}
{"text":"Great time eating at the grill table,  Had the All You Can Eat Sushi and BBQ, it was delicous,  Good food and service,  Season and cook great steak, short ribs were fantastic!  CA roll was a Lil salty?  That was the low pt, everything else was a fun good delicious time!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Korean food.  Soups lack any depth of flavor and BBQ tables are so small you better not bring more than 4 people to the show.  For the high prices this was really disappointing - especially from an eater who has spent several years living in Korea."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has any stars at all.  Perhaps the Korean BBQ is good; unfortunately, we went for drinks and sushi.  First impression was that the place was not very clean and is seriously understaffed.  Only a small assortment of wines and they only had one glass of the one I ordered.  My friend wanted a mixed drink, and the waitresses who were trying to also cover the bar had no idea what they were doing and needed to be instructed on how to make a gin and tonic.  Also worthy of note, their liquor display - you know, the cool wall of bottles that all bars have - is a sad display of just 5 bottles.  Onto the food.  The edamame was fine, but only lightly salted and a very small portion.  The spicy tuna roll was very good, but the Scottsdale roll lacked the precision I expect from a sushi chef.  It was an assortment of 6 very unevenly sliced cucumber; one piece was about 1 1/2 inch thick with others varying between 1/2 and 1 inch.  Overall, no ambience, horrendous service (albeit polite), and just adequate food."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Korean bbq. The sushi rolls were large and surprisingly fresh. Will be back to try the all you can eat!"}
{"text":"I normally don't leave bad reviews, but I have to leave you guys the real review about this place.  Just terrible. Simply just terrible.  All you can eat lunch sushi deal?  You have to wait one plate at a time. They are using the time factor to make you become full without actually feeding you food. And they charge $25? No thank you. Don't come here. You will be very disappointed. It doesn't matter if you ask nicely to expedite the process.   I understand that they are afraid of wasting food but we are responsible enough to control how much we order and eat.   Do not waste your money here...better off somewhere else where you will actually get full from a $25 meal."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!!!  Great food, good service, awesome prices.   Went for lunch for all you can eat special... Unfortunately only available with two or more per table. Ended up doing Bento box combo and a few pieces of tuna and albacore sushi. DELISH!!!  I'll definitely be back for the AYCE"}
{"text":"Yum!! Everything we had was good! We had a Rainbow roll, volcano roll (so good), lollipop roll, and some spicy soup with seafood. I would recommend everything we had. Our server Kyle was hilarious and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and customer service. My friends and I had a blast trying Korean BBQ for the first time. Please be aware to get the all you can eat everyone at the table needs to order the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Fun environment, chill location, Korean BBQ is the bomb. Waiters were friendly and helpful, Simon was amazing, one of the best waiters I've ever experienced!!! Highly recommend coming here with a party of 4 for a great night or even bring your date, he or she will love it and you'll be able to show off your cooking skills."}
{"text":"I was expecting something similar to Gyu Kaku, in Hawaii. Not even close and much more expensive than Hawaii too. 5 of us were seated at a table around one grill which wasn't going to be enough to cook everyone's food.  Good thing only 2 of us ordered for the grill, to share. The food we ordered didn't fit on the table top and we had to store drinks and food on an empty table nearby. The rice in the bi bim bap was crunchy and we all had upset stomachs after our meal.  The apple sake' was the highlight.  That was delicious. Not one of the 5 of us enjoyed our meals. And our bill was over $200. I can't afford to give this place another chance and risk the disappointment... The shared Mel didn't have enough meat to serve 2 people and it was very pricey."}
{"text":"Really average place for Japanese and Korean sushi.  Their kimchi is definitely a strange sour flavor that I've never had - and I've had a lot of kimchi in my lifetime. The person I was with ordered the kimchi soondubu and it was strangely sour as well.  I got the jap chae. It is definitely more Americanized here and they added ingredients that I haven't seen at other places, but was still good. I enjoyed it and finished my plate. The spicy bulgogi was mediocre. Wasn't cooked the best and the flavoring wasn't that great either.   Overall, very mediocre meal."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Peoria location for years and I was so glad when they opened up in Scottsdale! It's so much closer now! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and the food and staff is wonderful as always! The prices and reasonable and their food is, by far, worth it! I have never had a bad experience here and will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of Oh Ya on TBird. We were out in Scottsdale so we decided to give this location a try.   We we came on a Sunday night there was only two other tables dining in. Our server seemed a bit jittery throughout the whole meal.   The food was meh. The waiter totally forgot my husband's soup and my soup wasn't fully cooked. It came out with a raw egg right on top. When it should have been poached in the soup. No thanks.   Overall I don't think I will be back.  We will stick with our cozy and delicious Oh Ya on T Bird."}
{"text":"I'm a Korean food junkie. This place sucks balls. NOTHING is authentic. We waited for food for 30 minutes. Everything is old and not fresh. Bad and slow service. Not worth going back here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Price is reasonable. We had the all you can eat deal. Was with family who lived and visited Korea who agreed the food was delicious. You do need to understand how Korean BBQ works. Meat is served raw. You cook it yourself but that is the fun of it. Sides are a compliment to the meats. Great experience. Will be back."}
{"text":"On point! Great service, great food, great price, great location! Went for the AYCE on Wednesday and was expecting service to be a shotty, but this new location is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here lots of times and it's getting worse and worse every time. They have the worst servers ever. They would take forever to serve you. They have a 90 minute rule over ayce but every time you need something from them, it takes them 15-30 mins to give it to you. How can I leave in 90mins when you take FOREVER? It's so stupid. My bf ordered a beer and waited for the sushi. A minute after the waiter came back and dropped off the bill for us even tho we told her that we're still waiting for the sushi...Like we have to leave now when our food didn't even come yet. I love Korean BBQ but I would never come back here again. Worst worst customer service ever"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere in a very convenient location. My wife and I used to go Ohya in Glendale and both of us prefer food in this location.  Our server Casie, who we are familiar from Glendale location, made our visit there very pleasant. Ohya Scottsdale will be another one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi lunch special to go. Food was tasty. I only gave it 4 stars because the food didn't come with any kimchi or any other traditional Korean sides."}
{"text":"I'm eating my Ohya leftovers and plotting how soon I can return! I had a real ***** experience here, even though I was (a) alone except for my ebook, and (b) using a Local Flavor voucher. I treated myself to the garlic edamame (you need these, trust me), the otoshi salad (a junior poke bowl with fried fish skin strips 'n lots of seafood, I loved it), and the hamachi kama, which was on my foodie bucket list (I have no idea how most people eat it, but I sucked mine so clean I doubt my cat could have done better). A true grazing meal that added up to real satisfaction.  The restaurant itself I would describe as upscale sports bar with decor anchored by a huge \"pink blossom\" tree in the middle. Attractive, IMO. It was neither too noisy nor too quiet, too bright nor too dark--just about right. Best of all, the service was attentive without overdoing it. Ohya would be a great place to take a date, family or group, or, as in my case, all by yourself. Yes, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi I've ever had, seriously you are better off getting sushi at the grocery store. The fish tasted so old and even smelled old. I can't get the revolting taste of smelly old fish out of my mouth. I couldn't eat almost any of my food because it was so bad and then waited 20 minutes for a waiter to check on me. I let him know how I felt about the food and no manager came. Horrible experience and I will never come back. Paid way too much for 2 bites of disgusting food"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 3 weeks in a row- thanks to our server Hunter. He is the best! Great sushi, great drinks. He made us a \"Green Tea\" shot which wasn't even on the menu, and it was perfect! We have tried many places for sushi and this is our new favorite. Again, because of the wonderful service. Will continue to come here on a weekly basis as long as Hunter is here!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good service.  Great vibe here on saturday night.  We get all-you-can-eat and orders are served well and fast.  definitely will come again."}
{"text":"My family and I love oh ya! We always order it on uber eats! Legit Korean food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! We will never come back here. Our server had no idea what he was doing. We ordered a drink and not only did they take over 15 min to get us our drinks but they put a different ingredient in without even telling us! Which they didn't tell us till we asked about it. We then asked to exchange the drink and never received it. Finally our sushi comes and we asked for an extra side of eel sauce which we also never received. Mind you there were maybe 5 tables in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"We came in at around 9pm on a Wednesday. The food was really affordable and worth your money. Special today was buy one get one 50% off appetizer and 89 cent wings. For appetizers we ordered the seafood pancake which had seafood in every bite. The sauce was very flavorful. The bulgogi fries had a great ratio of meat to fries.  The meat was tender and juicy. The Korean fried chicken had the perfect amount of spice."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this restaurant. We visited this OHYA on Mayo for my daughter's 17th birthday tonight. There were four of us dining, including my 6 & 7 year olds.  We decided to try the all you can eat BBQ so we would be able to try a few different meats. According to our server, the rules were everyone at the table would have to participate and we would be billed for all four of us. $23 each for my oldest and I and $11.50 for each of the littles. I explained that my little ones wouldn't eat any of the meat, they don't like beef or pork and I would be buying them the chicken katsu dinner for $14. Rules are rules so I conceded. I paid for all four all you can eat dinners and the chicken katsu dinner. At the end of the meal I asked for a box. Our server informed me that this was yet another \"rule\" and I was not allowed to take home the food I over paid for. I feel the rules should have been explained completely at the start of the meal when guests are initially considering this option. I asked what they would be doing with the food and the server replied, \"it's wasteful but we just throw it away\".   Having grown up in Hawaii, I realize I have high expectations of Korean food. The food was average at best. The ban chan or Korean side dishes were limited and flavorless. Our grill had caramelized sauce burnt on it and was causing smoke all around our table. We were unable to find our server and had to flag down someone else to change it out.  L&L, as unauthentic as it is, would have been a better choice.   I was in the service industry for 12 years and I am not someone who complains. It takes quite a lot to warrant it. This visit was a waste of my hard earned money and my time. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Terrible place. we ordered Sushi combo B, and spicy soup with seafood. Soup was ok, but sushi were not fresh at all. They were like taste of the arse. I still have this taste in mouth.  I told ou waitress to tell it to manager, no reaction at all, manager never approached to me, to ask what was exactly wrong.  Bad service, never again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ in town. I've been here so many times already and it never fails to be delicious. The staff is friendly and personable, and the meat it delicious! 100% recommendable!"}
{"text":"I came back tonight to get more Korean BBQ. Like I stated in my last review on 12/26/2016, the restaurant's prime point of engagement is the BBQ itself. In other words, don't order anything else. Sushi is never TRULY fresh in Arizona, so just stop kidding yourself. The restaurant merely offers this because sushi is a selling point to Americans. You want good sushi? Go to Seattle. You still think sushi in OhYa is good? Travel more.  Anyway, tonight I ordered the table-top cook-it-yourself BBQ, and the two entrees I selected were the bulgogi (marinated beef) and the chadol baki (brisket, un-marinated). Since the brisket is unmarinated, I moved the chadol baki around the marinade that the bulgogi had been sitting in, along with the bed of onions any of the entrees sit on top of. The onions eventually infuse and coalesce with the meat to produce a wonderful total flavor. Served on top of the rice bowl or made into a lettuce wrap and it's a win.  When they bring out the vegetable side dishes, make sure you try each one to figure out which one you like the most, then ask your server to bring out more of that one. I suggest this out of benefit to OhYa themselves; they are a relatively new establishment in the Scottsdale area so knowing what the customer wants helps OhYa help you on future occasions. You can tell that OhYa is still trying to figure this one out."}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality of Korean food you get. The dishes we got barely had any meat in them"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I love this place! Tootsie Roll is our favorite!! Customer service is always awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and the service was great to boot! The bulgolgi here is high quality and they give plenty of side dishes to spice things up. I highly recommend this place to someone who wants good Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"The food was so-so. BBQ meat needed to be trimmed of the gristle BEFORE delivered to the table with dull scissors so we could do it. It's a bit hard with dull scissors. The drinks were good. Our waitress was so-so. The Korean lady that asked us to leave because they needed our table even though the whole place was MAYBE a quarter full was not good at all!! Who does that?!? Our waitress tried to apologize saying she wasn't trying to be rude but that it's a cultural difference. Maybe that's done in Korea but not here and we're here, not there. It was incredibly rude!! To top the evening off, when we did finally left our table, we went and sat at the bar. We sat there for probably 20 minutes and NO ONE came to serve us. NO ONE even bothered to acknowledge us. So, the place/evening went from mediocre to bad to horrible. To top it off, with so many table top grills, it's hot in there. They NEED to turn the AC down. Pouring sweat at dinner isn't anyone's idea of any enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Our friend who lives here suggested us to go here for dinner last night ( 06/14/18 )  . I have my sister in law and her grand daughter whose used to live in Korea for few years .  The waiter took our order and we ordered Balgi , bulgogi , Vegetable tempura , and one more order that I can't remember .  The waiter never gave us utensils and we had to keep asking them to bring us the utensils . So 15 mins later another person not the waiter told us they are running out Balgi . We were like seriously ? It's Thursday night like 7 pm and you guys don't have Balgi so we had to order something else.  My Friend wanted to have more of kimchi and etc since the waiter never bother to come and bring more and it got worse when the waiter told us you want more and my friend asked him isn't it free and he said yes . So I finally jumped in and said please bring everything .  When the veggie tempura came , honestly it was really bad . So I called another waitress since our waitress no where to be found  and tell her about the tempura came to my surprise her answer was that's how tempura look alike and I told her seriously ? Don't you think I have never had tempura before, I am asian I know how tempura looks like . I will never go back here again , bad service and foods.!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!. Took my kids there for dinner and not only was the food great, they had a blast cooking it. I highly recommend this restaurant.   So glad they opened up near me"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Arrived at 12 am to grab a late night sushi roll to only be rudely approached by the hostess saying they decided to close two hours early because they We're not busy. On a Friday night. We were whisked away,will never go again."}
{"text":"I was craving kbbq and my friend referred me to here and boy, it was a great choice! The atmosphere is very cozy and pretty. The meat and side dishes were all fresh and delicious. And many thanks to Irene for our awesome service. I will be back!"}

{"text":"As I walk in during lunch time, they have one server \"Jenny\" running around like a chicken with her head cut off. Not many people in here but, but Jenny is spinning. I see other customers upset and confused. People wanting to order and others wanting to desperately pay. I continue to wait, but this place clearly is understaffed. As I hear people leave, they didn't enjoy the restaurant or the food. And I too left..... did I get service? No, I was completely ignored. Customers leaving gave me good enough feedback that this place needs to up their game or just close down."}
{"text":"Ohya Scottsdale presents a much brighter, spacier and more refreshing interior than Ohya Glendale. I am not too familiar with Korean cuisine, so every dining experience here promises a variety of flavors and textures. This particular visit was for a birthday dinner, and we discovered that Ohya's menu options are great for big groups! Most of the meals could qualify for sharing purposes! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite sushi spots to go to. I got recommended to go here by one of my friends who's local to the area. The first time i went here we sat at the bar and got excellent service by the sushi chef. He recommended the Lollipop roll because he said it's great for fish lovers like us. I also think they have a wide variety of food, and also if you're looking for a place to do korean bbq this is definitely the place. I will be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Too slow. If you want wait a long time to get a small plate of meat, just coming to the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Loved it! Randi is an awesome server!! Can't wait to come back and try the Korean BBQ! Will definitely rave about the sushi! Good cut Korean sushi ;)! Comparable to LA restaurants. Loved it!! :) Will def come back soon!! Sake was chilled perfectly too... :)"}
{"text":"Won't be ever returning to this location or the Glendale location. Went to have the all you can eat. Required my 2 younger children to order all you can eat or no one in our party could order it. Asked if they could split the tables so the kids could order off the regular menu and they wanted to sit the children across the restaurant. Are you that afraid that we would be stealing your food? Poor, short-sighted customer service."}
{"text":"Oh my god, can they start a franchise in the northern Chicago burbs?  My wife and I stumbled on this place while in Scottsdale for a wedding.  Quite by accident (I was told to go to a sports bar starting with Oh).  Well, it was a happy accident.  We ended up going Friday and Saturday (and would have gone back Sunday if we didn't have a flight to catch).    The kimchi jigae was phenomenal (we went with extra spicy, and it was painfully good), the sundubu (day 2's soup split) was also really good.  The stone pot bibimbap was terrific as well.  I'm not sure how they get and keep the stone pots so hot, but the way it crisped up the rice at the bottom was to die for.  Also, at $6.25, the poke bowl (which is sizeable) could be the deal of the century.  In our north shore Chicago grocery store, a slightly smaller version of the same bowl runs me $11.  Not only was there ample fish (tuna), but the veggies and avocado in abundance really made this filling.  Were I not a glutton, I would have been satisfied with the poke bowl along.  Alas, finding good Korean food is tough to do where I'm from, so I went a little nuts.  Loved this place."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience in a restaurant. My two roommates and two friends decided to go here to celebrate one of my roommates birthday and we were all craving sushi and Korean BBQ. We had been to the Glendale location and decided to try this place out. Worst decision I've ever made. First off, my sushi that I had ordered took a while to come out but once it came out it was good and everything was fine. I had ordered a roll that I thought would be good and after tasting it, I did not like it so I put it off to the side. Our waitress Casie came over and saw that I hadn't eaten much of it and asked if I wanted a box. I responded with a no saying I didn't really like it. She asked why and I said that the sauce on it was sweeter then I expected and I didn't like it. She said ok and said she would have it taken off my bill. The next thing I know, this other rude lady comes storming over to me and my friends asking why I didn't want it. I again stated that I didn't not like the sauce. She then proceeds to tell me that she cannot cancel the order due to that it states on the menu what was it in. Well I wasn't about to argue with this lady so I just told her that I will just pay for it. I just want to point out that I DID NOT ask for the sushi to be taken off my bill, it was offered to me. I am a manager in retail and deal with food being returned in a kitchen as well and I would NEVER treat any one of my guests the way that lady did to me. And to add the icing to the cake, for the next 15 minutes afterwards while I was waiting to pay ($60 I might add) the entire wait staff decided to talk about it in the back of the kitchen and continuously keep looking at me until I left. Do not only did I leave absolutely pissed off, I left very uncomfortable. I will NEVER come back to this restaurant and I will make sure all of my friends and family never do as well and I WILL ask them all to spread the word about this place.   Through all of this, I would just like to say that Casie was amazing and an excellent waitress. She was super friendly and funny and always had a smile on her face. You should let her deal with your guests issues and not that other lady, you might be able to keep your guests happy."}
{"text":"After having Korean BBQ in LA was looking forward to the experience here   We were seated promptly and our order taken pretty quickly.....well the attempt was made to take it but we did not have menus.  There were not enough menus so we had to wait for one.   The place was not particularly packed   When the food came.... staggered  servings   I had mine first and the other came came out about five minutes later  it was pretty tasty.   The kimchi cucumber was good. I could have eaten that all night. The potato salad was made with the purple potatoes which made it interesting to look at."}
{"text":"The food was a little slow but it was well worth the wait. Our sushi was absolutely incredible and the Korean BBQ dish was fantastic. Our waiter Simon was purely excellent. His service was perfect and his suggestions were also great. Overall a great place for sushi and Korean BBQ. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Saw this place advertised on my Instagram and decided to give it a try and can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised! We walked in to a beautiful cherry blossom tree and was greeted immediately and taken to a table. Was explained everything and said someone will be right with us. Less than a minute later enter Simon are amazing server! Simon again explained all the rules to the AYCE and left to get our drinks. We ordered our BBQ which was very reasonably priced and wanted maybe another 3-5 minutes for it to come out. Our tabletop grill worked extremely well and cooked our first ordered of pork belly, brisket and short rib fantastically! The meats were extremely flavorful as were the sides. For our next round of 3 orders Simon gave us some wonderful recommendations so we gave them a try and he could not have been more correct, the pork he recommended was absolutely delicious! They changed our grill out pretty frequently and our service/server was some of the best we have had in the valley! They do have a full bar with some unique cocktails that I look forward to trying in a future visit. Overall for me this placed checked all my boxes for a 5 star review and I look forward to coming back soon and having Simon as my server again!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service was poor.  We had only been to one korean bbq before a long time ago, and that experience was much better (in a different city).  We brought my father and brother in law here since they were visiting from out of town.  We thought it would be fun and different since they had never been to a korean bbq.   The servers were not very knowledgeable and just plopped the food in front of us without saying much, they didn't even tell us which cuts were what.  We had to keep asking how we were supposed to cook the food, to bring salt/pepper, etc...  I would have much rather cooked them dinner at home due to bad atmosphere.  The food isn't bad, I hope management makes the restaurant more inviting/informative to people that are new to korean bbq."}
{"text":"Great interior, nice atmosphere. Kpop music videos playing on one of the TVs. Fair selection of sushi rolls and sashimi. Tried the Haboob and White Boy rolls (awesome) and the doengjang jjigae, which was pretty standard. Next time I would try the kimchi jjigae."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Go with the all you can eat bbq. So much fun."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, all of us in our party without exception, commented to each other that, the ventilation has to be improved. Let me expound on that. While the aroma of the BBQ and other dishes are excellent, the fume and the odor from BBQ-ing meat from other tables and throughout the dining area that get embedded in your clothes, and for ladies particularly, into their hair is not all that appealing.   We've been to other Korean style BBQ restaurants in this city as well as various other cities, but their ventilation system was much better.  Now for the food. The price is on the mid to high-mid range. The taste is good but not on the level of excellence. Service is mediocre and sparse throughout the restaurant.   Might I suggest, that, if you are going to have Scottsdale pricing in Scottsdale area, you should also have service level that is appropriate to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So delicious! Alex was such a great server!! She really went above and beyond to give us a wonderful experience. I'll definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Finally!  Korean BBQ in our part of town! I ordered the Bulgogi (I'm in a rut...so what?) It was good - the sides were also really good. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered - gotta go back!!!"}
{"text":"All of the food here is so fresh and delicious. I love the ambience and I always have a great time when I eat here whether it be with my friends or family.  Everything from the food to the service is top notch. You should definitely try their fun cocktails and be sure to ask for Irene!!! She's seriously the sweetest. Just the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service with timely rolls. We sat down immediately and the sushi rolls were out in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Great service,  amazing sushi menu,  delicious korean bbq, and great ambiance!!! Fair priced. Not cheap but not breaking the bank either."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went to the Scottsdale location on Mayo. The BBQ is fabulous. But so are the regular dinners. The fried rice is the best I've had. Solid happy hour too. Took my parents who know Korean food well and they loved it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Expect to wait well over an hour (at lunch) to get your food and then not everyone at your table might not even get their food. Absolutely ridiculous! Don't even bother coming here..."}
{"text":"Very Impressive with service and managment. The flavor of the food was amazing. Totally coming here again!"}
{"text":"Post review - This experience happened in early January. My family wanted to take me here for my birthday. I read the reviews and saw that there were some good and some bad. We went for the all you can eat barbecue and sushi. It was excellent! The server was attentive and really nice. She explained how the process worked. I thought being able to cook our food was cool and fun. There were a couple of issues with the grill. Unfortunately, the fan didn't work at the table. I came out smelling like a barbecue, but it was worth it! And, there was new young guy working there and he had a difficult time changing out the grill. It was scary at times, but he didn't burn us. The side dishes that they provide are small, but they are more than happy to give you more. We asked for additional kimchi. The sushi and meat were really good. We tried all kinds of types of meat including lamb, ribs, tongue, etc. Also, since it was all you can eat, I was expecting them to give a couple of pieces of rolls. Nope, they gave you the entire roll. If you can eat two rolls, you already made up the cost which was only $24.95! I came out stuffed and had to roll out of there."}
{"text":"The place is huge and combination of Japanese and Korean food. They're a little expensive for the choices of food you can get. I love that they change the cook too once in a while. Food is 4 out of 5. They take a minute to come back to your table. Not a bad place just a little pricey"}
{"text":"First, we walked in and it took a good 5 minutes to even be acknowledged. There were 2 seated tables at the time. I have been to the other location and never had a problem with the food. This location definitely is beautiful aesthetically. I am also Korean, so my Korean food taste buds are pretty on point. The food was extremely lack luster at this location with no flavor and definitely no spice. I sent back the dok Bokki and the soft tofu soup for more spice. It came back out with just a ridiculous amount of hot pepper just dumped in to where it was inedible. I was extremely disappointed. So disappointed that I went through a drive through on the way home. Since this location just opened I will give it a few weeks to work out some kinks and try it again. I don't have high hopes though."}
{"text":"Stay away from the all you can eat. Quality of meat is horrible. Service is pretty sad, may be why the restaurant was empty for a Saturday night.  I can't speak for the other food but for Korean BBQ, you have so many other better options."}
{"text":"Tried OHYA for the first time.  Very nice ambiance.  We tried the Haboob and White Boy sushi rolls and the Denjang Chigae soup.  All was very tasty accompanied with friendly service.  Sure to be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant in Arizona!! I tried all food in this restaurant and also military soup and pork belly bun. They were bomb~~~  You wont regret it ~ !! Don't waste your time !!  Also server was very kind and professional. She recommended a really good food and her choice was right!! My friends and I were satisfied more than enough ~ I will definitely come back again ~"}
{"text":"It was a great experience! I have never been to Korean bbq and this is definitely one of the best restraunts I've been to in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is the most exciting restaurant to hit my area in a long while. The options for Asian, specially Korean or Japanese were totally limited, and here itcomes Ohyo. From outside it didn't seem that inviting to me, but once inside this place is comfortable, & you feel right at home. A bowl of hot Pho sure confirmed that. The food was amazing. Tasty and delicious. The drink was right in point, The portions are great! And service was done with a smile. This place is authentic but trendy. They have buffet.... Whaaaat? There's no buffet options in this area either. Plus, they close at 1... !! It's definitely a place to support."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat Korean BBQ. Friendly staff and fresh sushi grade fish. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to take a friend or family that is visiting. Peaceful cooking fun with an ornate layout. Come here it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Really great Korean food, great ambiance, servers are really fast specially Alex. My Mom is pain in the ass for asking her a lot of stuff to get but she managed to listen and get everything done at the same time. We'll definitely come back here. Make long story short, if u want an awesome korean/ Asian food. Must visit this place. You won't regret it, and trust me. Worth it every penny."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the worst service I've had in any restaurant in ages. The waiter walked over to the table as if we were a nuisance. He wrote the order down and delivered the wrong food and then blamed us. After pointing out the error, it was nothing but attitude from him. He never came back to ask how we liked the food or if we wanted anything else, dropping off the check without a word. He never thanked us for coming in. I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon, unfortunately, only for sushi. Chose Philly salmon to avoid eating fake crab. Looked like it was purchased from grocery store. IT WAS SPOILED!!! HORRIBLE taste in my mouth ALL DAY! NO APOLOGY! NO COMPENSATION! Had to pay MORE for something else, without fake crab. Empty at lunchtime, only 2 other people in there the whole time. Run down seating. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but I'm sorry it's not amazing and blows me out of the water either. Only good Korean BBQ has been in LA, sorry AZ, it's a tough comparison but it's true.   Anytime I've come here it's been very slow with not many people. This last time I went instead of doing the Grill we ordered off the lunch menus. I had the beef bulgogi box with a basic California roll, gyoza piece and spring roll with the most rice in life. The bulgogi was kind of flavorless and I had to add a bunch of soy and I got some spicy Korean sauce to mix it in. I just would think there is more flavor, the sliced meat and no added anything seems odd to me.   The wait staff seemed kind of slow or maybe it was just a low count of staff and that's my perception. Not much of a check in to see how things are going or how the food tastes.  The tree in the middle is cool and the center piece of the restaurant. But the overall ambience and random pics and such are just off to me.   I mean it's the closest Korean BBQ spot to where I am and it's fine just not hyped about it."}
{"text":"Super good and authentic Korean food with Sushi med to high grade which is a win win. Awesome environment and worth the time."}
{"text":"Walked in around 5pm and it was empty which worked out Great for us. We chose the grill ourself section. They gave a lot of options on the sides. The bbq and sushi was all very tastey! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It's amazing place! You can enjoy Korean BBQ and sushi! We had great time here with delicious BBQ! Plz come here!"}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are a great deal! Huge serving of main dish, rice and a side comes with it. Love their dugolgi and dol sat bibimbap! Their sushi is pretty good as well as are their potstickers."}
{"text":"This restaurant has both great Korean food and great Japanese food! Everything they serve is fresh and tasty! They have a wonderful menu that has something for everyone. Their servers are friendly and helpful! The restaurant also has a nice ambiance. I highly recommend this place to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I love OHYA, and their newest location is great! Still far AF for me, but whatever lol. I feel like the food and service is much better at this location than the Glendale one. Their kimchi jjigae was better at this location than the Glendale one. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because they had one server working at that was it. She was incredible though and did her very best to get to everyone."}
{"text":"Ohya is the only all you can eat Korean BBQ place in town that I know of, they have AYCE KBBQ every Wednesday. You have the option to eat AYCE sushi with BBQ , or get the unlimited sushi or BBQ separately. It's a few dollars less if you decide to just get sushi or just do BBQ. This location is really close to me, but I have not frequented here much since they opened. Honestly, although I love AYCE KBBQ , their service and the food quality was just meh... It was always a long wait to get your next order of BBQ meat or sushi put in, and they never asked you if you want your grill changed. Their  banchan (side dishes )are also really mediocre, you can really judge how good a Korean restaurant is just by their banchan . Today was a great experience! Our server Randi was attentive, she was very busy but she and the rest of the staff made sure to check on us regularly. They offered to change the grill three times, and the orders took much faster than in the past. I'm pleased with the service, now that I know they are doing a better job, I will be sure to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"1. The zucchini in bibimbop was spoiled and smelled and tasted sour. 2. I found dried green onion stuck in my rice bowl. GROSS.    Those are the reason I gave one star.   Other complaints are tofu soup wasn't hot enough, so the raw egg inside wouldnt cook. I asked them to boil it and and it took long time in the process. Of course we had to replace the bibimbop.   The galbi tasted okay, but tofu didnt taste good. Bulgogi was too salty."}
{"text":"Best sushi! great customer service! clean, friendly staff, no wait ! They are very friendly, and have fast service! I would defiantly recommend ohya to anyone that wants sushi/Korean bbq"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Korean BBQ! Used to go to the other location on Thunderbird, but have switched to this one because all the grills are gas at the new location. Wonderful service and the all-you-can-eat special is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Korean food! Just opened so service still has a few kinks to work out, but they were incredibly nice and apologetic--and the food was worth it!  Beautifully done interior."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with my friends. I got there earlier than the others and was seated right away next to this gorgeous faux cherry blossom tree. I talked to my server about my dietary needs and she suggested a couple of things to me. Once my friend arrived, I got some edamame and the yakisoba bowl with tofu. It was so tasty and I ended up taking half home so I could also try an avocado roll. Overall it was a great experience and I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cool place. The restaurant ambiance is nice for both families and couples on a date night. The service was excellent and they have a good selection of beer if your into that. The sushi was really good, I recommend the Sonoran Roll and the Mexican Roll. I will definitely come eat here again next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant here! The people who works there is so nice. And their bbq + happy hours are just amazing!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken bento dish was good as well as our Sushi.  Lisa Kim, our server didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  Very frank and not personable.  No napkins for our drinks, ask for a fork twice and a to-go box.  Still tipped over 20%, hopefully it will bring her some sunshine."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean BBQ! Our waitress was very helpful in explaining on how everything works and was super friendly. We got plenty of food and it was super delicious! The mochi ice cream was amazing too!! Also, don't be afraid to try the side dishes they bring out. They were delicious too! 10/10 I totally suggest this place"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Nice place. Great sushi happy hour prices which are good all day long.  Good service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Five stars for the excellent service of Tyler and Collins. Good presentation and amazing taste. My new favorite place! Oh ya!"}
{"text":"Lol if you wanna go to restaurant and serve yourself this is the place!   I had to get my own drinks, my own napkins and chopsticks and spoons, after the food (which took forever to even order and even longer to come out) i asked for a togo box from my server and youd think theyd get the idea to deliver my check but it took 10+ min so i had to stand up AGAIN to ask for the check...   I about stood up 5-6 times throughout my dinner...  Never again. Worst place ever"}
{"text":"Started off with a salad of green onion and daikon. Very refreshing. Only 6 banchan but the wife liked the sweet potato or pumpkin puree concoction. Ordered the Mayo combination set. The combo meals come with a Korean egg souffle and a basic bibimbap.  The Mayo had thin sliced Brisket, two strips of galbi, marinated spicy pork and a bulgogi meat. Overall meal was good but they are under staffed. Only two waitresses and some bus help."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! The bulgogi and tootsie roll are my favs. Perfect date night, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"They have changed a lot. Great services and great food! Bbq and sushi were delicious and price is inexpensive. I definitely recommend and maybe this is the best k bbq in arizona."}
{"text":"I'm from California, so I have some bias when it comes to Asian food. But the meats weren't fresh, they were definitely frozen prior, and frozen for a while. Although this isn't bad, but it just doesn't seem assuring to eat because some of the meats that came out were pretty gray and partially thawed. Their servers always seem very new and poorly trained. I'm not dissing the servers because they seem like pretty cool people and they are trying, but they don't seem sure when answering questions or giving full details about specials. I asked for a sake bomb, and said I wanted a Sapporo beer to go with it. When my server came back out to ask what size sake i wanted, I asked whatever one the $7 sake bomb special was. I don't blame the server, he seemed pretty nervous and new to what a sake bomb consisted of, but I blame management for charging me an extra two dollars for asking for a Sapporo when I didn't know what the special restrictions were ahead of time. Thank you to that server for taking it off my order per your managers order. It made it a little less frustrating."}
{"text":"Service & Food definitely need improvement.  Ordered the Bulgogi and was really disappointed.  Meat was very \"mushy\" and so la la tasting. It came with white rice & Korean condiments like kimchi etc.  I am Korean BBQ lover but this had nothing to do really with Korean BBQ.  The server lacked friendliness and was very slow.  Will I be back? I don't think so...."}
{"text":"Food is so good, service is so bad. Everyone just disappears from time to time and it seems like the staff hates each other. Would come back more if service was better.   Returned a week ago and it looks like a whole new crew of servers from my previous visit. Much better experience and the food was good as usual."}
{"text":"I've come to this place twice. The atmosphere is fun, everything is really clean, the staff is pleasant. The meat is high quality and the sushi is good too. Good service. Seems like they have nice happy hour and lunch deals but unfortunately haven't made it out for that yet."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write. The food itself was very good but the service was very off. They could not keep up with the few tables that they had. They don't come back to refill waters unless you flag someone down. They forget if you ask for a refill on rice or anything else. They just do not seem to have their management and staff attuned properly or even running as it should. And they weren't even busy. We were only 2 people and didn't need much but it's still good customer service to check if we need refills on water or just simply check on us. We know they have only been open less than a month but this is their second location and things should be running properly. Maybe we will wait a couple of ,Katy's before going back because the food was just as good as other location. Or maybe we will just go to the other location. We will see what other reviewers experience over time."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Friendly, knowledgeable staff. We stumbled on this gem after a movie and were so glad we did. Great mix of Korean BBQ and sushi. We tried it all and it exceeded ours expectations. Great place for a large party or a date. Nice TVs and bar to have a drink and watch the game. Def worth a look."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant that I've ever been to. I really love the bulgogi and the shrimp tempura roll. The interior design is really beautiful, i love the lights and the cherry blossom tree in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Go for their All You Can Eat KBBQ & Sushi Wednesdays!  Pros:  - All you can eat KBBQ & Sushi.  - 1st visit: Waitress was kind, attentive and lenient on the 90min time limit.  - Sushi portions are amazing.  - Reasonable price (30$~ w tax)  Cons: - 2nd visit:  Waitress wasn't as attentive changing out the grill, handing out water or giving plates/utensils to each person sitting at our table.  KBBQ meat selections weren't explained as they came out. We had to guess what meat was which. So we didn't even know if we got what we ordered. Same goes for the sushi."}
{"text":"We have been huge fans of Ohya and eat at the Phoenix/Thunderbird location frequently. We were in Scottsdale at the movies and got excited to see they had a location where we were.   The restaurant itself is huge and the seats were super comfortable. The waitress was amazingly friendly and very helpful! The food is great- try the edamame appetizer, veggie tempura, spicy pork, Katsu, and chicken while you're there!  However, there were several differences between the Phoenix location and this one. The portion sizes were smaller and you need to sit at a grill top table if you want the BBQ items (at the Phoenix location, they will cook the BBQ in the kitchen and bring it to you regardless of what table you're sitting at). The Scottsdale location also didn't have the chicken wings appetizer (which are delish).   They lost some points from me for forgetting my dish altogether (we were a part of 4 and my dish was brought out when everyone else was almost done) and they didn't clear the dirty dishes away.   Overall, good food but my suggestion is to go to the location on Thunderbird for an overall good experience."}
{"text":"I really don't find any difference in quality as the previous \"Asian\" restaurant the location was previously. If you know Korean food then you come here because you're really really desperate but I don't blame you. We crave. Ambience and food is mediocre for quality but if you're desperate then OK. Open late!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is not good. It's not fresh, and it tastes terrible. I'd recommend going somewhere along a coast or with easy access to fresh fish. You can tell this place doesn't served fresh fish for its sushi."}
{"text":"We went in for a light but late lunch and found the place with only a few other tables with customers.  Atmosphere was great service was helpful professional and great.  The menu is extensive with many Korean and Japanese dishes.  We had a Scottsdale roll without salmon but added extra ahi.  The cucumber wrap of seafood kind of a poke was outstanding. A pain to pickup with Korean stainless steel chopsticks because it was slippery but fingers or spoon worked well.  Very tasty even with the berry sauce on the plate.  I always like to judge a place on tempura prawns.  They were light crunchy outside and tasty as they should have been I'd rate them 7 out of 10 but keep in mind that I've only had 10 out of 10 a few times and only in Tokyo.   So for Phoenix this is a great rating.   The sushi bar counter did not have a big selection of fish.  But it all looked very good and I respect establishments that do not overstock and have old stuff out.  I give that a high rating.  They did not try to push old fish on you.   They didn't have any. It was a Wednesday about 2:00pm.   We will definitely return for a bigger meal.  My wife is Korean and we cook and love great food.  Thus place can perform to our picky standards.  I see a potential problem in that one needs to know both  Korean and Japanese cuisine to order properly."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood with great food and prices. We will definitely be back. Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Will definitely not be coming back!! When we arrived, we advised that we would be using  the Groupon individually. Well when we came to paying they said we can only use one voucher needless to say the manger did nothing to be apologetic. Also they have \"freebies\" so individuals can up^^ there ratings.   Now as far as our waiter she was amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful decor. Definitely recommend this place. We went with some friends and it was Wednesday and they have all you can eat Korean BBQ & Sushi. I am Korean and felt the BBQ was excellent. The only reason for the four stars is because the side dishes are good not great. Maybe I am more critical since I grew up eating Korean food. Love the tabletop grilling."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is a comparatively clean korean restaurant! Some of the menu is ok, and some of them is pretty good! My favorite is Nakji Bokum!!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for Korean food! Never disappointed! Good quality and quantity of a variety of sides and entrees, including the sushi! Always leave full and satisfied. We usually grill our own meat with fresh vegetables to go along with some of their appetizers that I'm not going to attempt to name or spell without my wife's supervision. I highly recommend giving this place a  try! The service is excellent and the atmosphere is inviting. And the food....love it!!"}
{"text":"Great poke bowls! We come every week the price is great as well! It has a large selection of sushi and Korean BBQ as well!"}
{"text":"I thought the price was a match to the food given. Service was great. The restaurant itself  was pretty. In all a good time."}
{"text":"Tuesday is taco Tuesdays and the Korean tacos are the best in town.  The menu combines a fusion of Japanese and Korean delicacies.  The Korean spicy seafood soup is tantalizing to the senses and will leave you wanting one to go! I highly recommend this place, the portions are large and the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"recommended by friends   not worth to try nor go back here . friday night there are open  table but   setrvice was slow , selection of ayce was limited  happy hour   menu is ok. they don't even explain anything  n your order ."}
{"text":"One of the best korean bbq in town! Worth the price for unlimited bbq! Our server, Simon was great and always there to check us with our needs. Will be coming back here next time."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - New Kids On The Block - The Right Stuff \"2nd Verse\")  Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh Oh-ya Oh oh oh oh oh The right stuff  Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh Oh-ya Oh oh oh oh oh The right stuff  The first cut was a sweet cut Second cut had a twist Third and your fourth cut I don't want to miss  I can taste it in your sauce Tell 'em when I Yelp Taste it in everything you serve Even in your sides  You got the right stuff, Ohya Love the when you turn it on You got the right stuff, Ohya You're the reason why I sing this song   Ohya is a beautiful restaurant and setup for some All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ!  Probably the only AYCE Korean BBQ on the north side of Scottsdale for now.    Needless to say, be ready to cook or not!  I came with a group of friends and Ohya was pretty strict about who orders what at the table.  Not too surprised; if one orders the AYCE option then all the people at the table must do the same.  I understand the reasoning behind it, but sometimes as a guest it still irks me.  This was nothing new since all or most Korean BBQ restaurants do this.    For our AYCE option we went with the basic $23 per head; adding sushi option would be $26, but we didn't see the point since that's a lot of food!  I think overall the beef bulgogi or anything bulgogi here would be best since it was well marinated.  The NY Strip is a plus, but it definitely took some time to cook each cut since they were pretty large in size.  The spicy pork needed an extra kick while the beef tongue and the briskets were pretty bland.  We got our basic kimchi sides and rice, which to my surprise; they didn't serve us more since it's typically the filler and probably would have made us more full and over with quicker!  Overall, Ohya did a solid job from what I experienced.  They have a decent HH menu and I didn't get a chance to check out their sushi, but I'm in a Korean BBQ restaurant; probably won't be ordering that anytime here.  There wasn't much of a hiccup from our ordering process and they were pretty quick to hit our table every time we ordered, but from what I read there is a time limit to how long you can stay so cook up and eat up as fast as you can!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent bulgogi and great service from Simon!! Very full :) My friend Phil was crying tears of joy"}
{"text":"Since I liked their Glendale location, I've patiently waited for their grand opening here so close to my office. Well it's been a while since their opening but my chance to try here finally came during lunch.  They have BBQ at the table section in the back as well as sushi bars and regular tables near the entrance. Since I came here for table BBQ, I requested a table with BBQ set. Premium combination BBQ was about $60 for two people. Comes with four different types of meat, bulgogi, banchan, egg soup, clear soup, and white rice. Portion size is very generous. We ate all served but I was quite full. In fact I skipped dinner that night as I was still full during dinner time.   Meat quality is quite good, better than other place I recently went nearby. We cooked on our own but a server came by several times to help us too.  Could have used more banchan variety, but still good.  Service has a room to improve a lot here but since we were not in a hurry, just enjoyed a long two hours lunch time here.  Not much of desert selection here. Macaron ice cream and mochi ice cream. Macaron was out on the day I visited so I had mochi.   They have so much more than just BBQ. Looking forward to coming back to try some of Korean dishes here."}
{"text":"Finally a great Korean BBQ restaurant in Scottsdale! Easily the best Korean BBQ I have had. The service is great and the food is impeccable! I would highly recommend for groups since you can cook the pork, steak and chicken right at the table. The bimbi bop is outstanding! I know several people that come here several times a week, it's that good!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. They were understaffed but were very friendly and helpful. Ordered the pork belly and short ribs. The food was good. At this place you get to cook the meat yourself if you choose the grill option and order a combo or more than 2 meat options. Otherwise if you order only one meat option or you sit at a table it is prepared for you already. The variety of banchan is a little small but not a big deal. They have lettuce and rice upon request.  The environment was pretty unique and what makes this place cool. They have three sections a standard grilling area, a restaurant area( with a tree in the middle), and a medium bar area with tvs. I could see coming here for all three dinning styles."}
{"text":"Love going to the Ohya in Peoria! This one, not so much. Hopefully you don't get served by Mindy. Not very nice with the guests. Food is good, servers can definitely pick up a few tips on hospitality, environment is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. Did the grill and sushi combo. 2 rolls and one grill section for $16.95. Have been here for the grill your own, unlimited before as well. That can look pricey, but if you have an appetite, it is actually a great deal! Food is very fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here since the beginning  in Glendale and they have always been good. I could compare it to LA ktown Korean bbq!! That's how good it is!"}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago celebrating a birthday with a good sized group. They take reservations and were accommodating when another person in our group showed up. Simon was our server and he was wonderful. He came back consistently to check on us and made sure we had everything we needed for our all-you-can-eat adventure. He was friendly and talked with us. I'm back again today with Simon as our server and everything was still great, from the service to the food."}
{"text":"I must grant 5 stars to this new OHYA for their BBQ GRILL TABLE. Seriously, they are AWEsome! I enjoy KBBQ very much, and I am willing to drive to LA any day anytime just to eat some grilled pork belly. Although I have lived in AZ almost all my life, I have not had many chances to have authentic Korean charcoal grilled meat. (Plus the ones I've been to didn't meet my expectations) I am so so glad there's another OHYA, much near, with newly equipped BBQ grills, and i have a good feeling we will be coming to this location very often. When it comes to eating out, my family chooses for the food we can't cook at home. Their new grill burnt the charcoal almost instantly, adding a distinct flavor to the meats. Inside and outside of this new restaurant were just fabulous, with more of a caf√©-style feel to it. We ordered 2 orders of pork belly, 2 orders of cha-dol (beef brisket) and a soybean paste soup, and it was a lot. What also surprised us was the quality of meat and its tenderness. Also the staff members are very nice. The Korean lady (i forgot to ask her name) that served our table, was friendly and attentive. The only thing we had to deal with was when some of us asked for a second bowl of rice, it was a bit too small portion, but besides that minor problem, we were all stuffed and happy after our meal and we will be visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"I really loved their meat and banchan. Their service was great as well. They kept busy and checked if you needed anything once in awhile. I would definitely be coming back here for my Gogi fix. (:"}
{"text":"Daeji Bulgogi is my favorite Korean dish and Ohya did not disappoint.  The meet was perfectly seasoned/marinated, fresh and so delicious!  I ordered the lunch bento box which included rice, cali roll, 1 shrimp tempura, edamame, Korean side dishes and a spring roll.  The spring roll was gross and just doesn't go with the Korean theme. A pot sticker/gyoza would have been a better pairing.  Regardless,  I can't wait to try Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, especially for never having been to a Korean bbq restaurant before. We had a Groupon for sushi, but we decided to do the Mayo combo and ordered sushi on top of that. The combo was delicious and could have fed 3 people easily. The sushi was tasty and beautifully presented! Our server was kind and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"People commented about the wait time and they are right. Even ordering ahead with yelp for a takeout order, you have to wait. No working phone number to check with order status!"}
{"text":"food is great! 10/10 nice people and service! i recommend their chicken teriyaki bowl. even better if you get the sushi and hot plate combo $16 that's a bank for you buck, you get the teriyaki chicken and either two traditional rolls or a signature roll. I did two rolls and chicken teriyaki, super filling and enough for two people. i recommend this place for family or friends"}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night for a birthday party for one of my friends.  We were allowed to make a reservation for 10.  The server was very slow and service. And we had wanted to order 4 orders of the yellowtail collar but they only had one order left. I ordered the tofu soup with the bulgogi combo.  The bulgogi wasn't even sizzling on the hot plate.  When most of us opened our rice bowls it look like it was eating into only two of them look like they were new.  It took us a while to grab the server's attention to let her know about the rice bowls."}
{"text":"The best part about this place was the cool tree in the center and the artsy chairs; other than that, not worth a 2nd try.  Came on a Fri. night, we were the only ones at the bar, and only 2-3 tables in the restaurant.  We ordered a Vegas roll and a beer/saki; roll was not nearly as good as rolls we've had at Nori or other Scottsdale sushi places.  We presented a Local Flavor deal that said nothing about having to have $20 worth of FOOD to redeem, only that it can't be used on lunch specials.  Waitress literally said, \"If you want to argue about it, I'll  accept it\" and did so; there was nothing to argue about, it was written in black and white! When I told her she could read it herself, she said \"I don't need to read it.\" Total witch.  Will DEF not return. This place will  not last til the end of the year; they have no draw, and anyplace this dead on a Friday night when the other places in the same strip mall are on a wait list, that should tell you something.  Go elsewhere and save yourself crummy sushi and sh$tty attitude!"}
{"text":"Came here for their AYCE BBQ and all I can say is, \"wow!\" The portions were huge & the selections of meat was plentiful. Our fav ended up being the marinated pork steak, marinated lamb meat, & the marinated boneless short rib. All were delicious!  Our server Jade was super nice and friendly. She knew the different cuts of meat & explained them well to us. The grill was changed frequently. As my son says, \"I am leaving here very satisfied!\"  Just fyi, the portions were so big, we ended up ordering 1/2 orders and it was still plenty for 2 people!  Comes with salad, all the side dishes & rice. A big !"}
{"text":"Yes, it is my day off, I've been looking for a good Korean BBQ and Kimchi around the area, so here we are!! Very Fresh Sashimi 16 Pcs only$25, and shumai appetizer. Coconut Beer  From Hawaii, and blueberry soju from Korea. And BoBa Mathcha Green Tea for to go 94 degrees in AZ is perfect. The service was great, they open until 11pm. Check it out on happy hour after 9pm."}
{"text":"The one thing that this place has going for it is that it's open late on the weekends. There aren't many options for late night drinking in this part of town if you live close and just want to walk somewhere for a few drinks. We were super excited to see that they were going to give the one place that's open late some competition. If you're in it for that - it's cool. Just don't expect great service. The late night bartender is the server for the entire place - which serves food until midnight. They just aren't accommodating for the crowd that wants a late night dinner or drink with enough servers. Also, the food is terrible. Tried a couple of terrible sushi rolls and also got some bulgogi once. Neither was good. I'll only be stopping here for drinks in the future."}
{"text":"Got there sat night waited but no hostess,got seated at sushi bar. Appears to be short staffed drink waitress didn't come back. Soy sauce container hadn't been cleaned crusty nasty, food was excellent cleanliness marginal they ran around like they were short staffed no floor manager seen. Was overcharged but corrected when brought up. They sat a guy with his 2 little girls at the alcohol bar a No no .will try again as food excellent management nonexistent hope the owner reads this and fixes it only reason to be critical it to help you"}
{"text":"Tried it out bc saw a movie at Harkins Theatre nearby and had a Groupon. Since Groupon only good for sushi that's what I ate. Sushi combo B. Sushi was fresh and excellent. Large portions of a great variety of fish as nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. Loved it. Nice specials on drinks and Korean food--I'll be back."}
{"text":"We initially checked out Ohya about a year ago, since it was close to our place in Desert Ridge at the time. We have since gone back a few times for the BBQ sets, and a little Sushi. On our last visit we discovered they now have a BBQ/Sushi Buffet. It's well worth the $26 per person for all you can eat Korean BBQ and Sushi. They do have a somewhat fixed menu of items that you can order from at different price points. However, at the $26 price point you get a lot of variety of meats and sushi to pick from. Our server Simon was a bit soft, but had the personality to really make it work for him. He did an awesome with our constant ordering, and made us feel right at home. We love this place, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ohya Sushi and Korean grill on thunder bird many times, however this is the first time I tried this location. Walking into the restaurant there was a beautiful cherry blossom tree in the middle of the dining area. It was a lot more modern and bigger than the one on thunderbird but it wasn't as busy as the other location.   The food was good. I ordered the yang gi tang which is a Korean spicy soup that consists of clear glass noodles, beef marrow/intestines and beef tripe. I've had this dish at other Korean restaurants. I would say it was a 3/5 stars. At first it was good the spice was nice and there was a lot of tripe but the intestines got a bit overwhelming. I would not suggest this to customers who are not into trying different things because the beef intestine requires a certain palette to enjoy it.   My friend ordered the beef bugolgi which came on a hot sizzling plate served with small mined beef and onions. I wish the beef pieces were a little bit bigger but overall the flavor was great. I would definitely recommend it. Another dish that we got was the Korean seafood pancake. There was a variety of seafood in the pancake such as clams, soft shell grabs and small pieces of other seafood. It was served with a sweet type of soy sauce.   Overall the food was great. The reason why it is a 4 star instead of a 5 star is due to the lack of service."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  If your feeling in the mood for Korean BBQ and sushi and can't make up your mind. This is the  place.  It has the best of both worlds.  We went on a Friday night around 10 PM and it was fairly slow.  We opted for sushi and BBQ.  We ordered beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi for the grill. It was nice that they provided veggies with each meat dish as well.  Personally my favorite was the beef.  It was nice and tender, with an explosion of flavor.  We also ordered 4 rolls (lovers roll,  spider roll, CA roll, and another with baked salmon on top).  Rolls where pretty good. Nothing too special but presentation and sauces took it to another level.  I felt if the service wasn't so slow it would have been a better experience.  They literally had one person for each position working that night.  Considering it was a Friday night. I expected for the staff to be somewhat ready for a rush. This place was the opposite.  There was one server,  one cook, and one host.  The food prep was the longest wait ever!!!! I felt like to even get our uncooked meat for the grill took a good 20 mins to come out.  By that time we were getting full from the side dishes, thank God for those or else we would have been starving."}
{"text":"Sooo many rules and regulations,  sub par food,  poor service,  this place Ida a joke"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house. There's not a lot of Asian food options, yet alone Korean food. There's KBBQ and other authentic dishes that are more affordable than the other establishment in Desert Ridge. They keep trying to change things up to appeal to a tougher crowd. There's happy hour and reverse happy hour. AYCE days or options change periodically."}
{"text":"We love Korean BBQ and this spot is an A-Ok! Quick craving fix. The AYCE is $22 pp and $26 pp if you add sushi, we didn't do sushi due to the time constraints. There is an hour and one-half time limit which is fine except our grill kept turning off and we had to wait until someone had time to come and reignite it. Twice by our server, twice by the busboy and once more my another server.  The best meats here are the beef bulgogi and the NY Strip. The beef tongue is okay and so are the short ribs. Pork belly was good and so was the calamari but the intestines took so long to cook and with the time limit we really didn't get to get them to the crispy level that we like.  Not a bad place just not a five star best I've ever had. A two hour time limit would be better considering the grills need to stay at a medium low per the restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. As a group of 5, our dining experience took 2 hours! And we didn't even choose the tabletop grilling. The service was just super slow and perhaps they were understaffed? You would hope that after all that waiting maybe the food would make up for it but no, I paid $25.50 (after tax and *included* tip) for this nasty overcooked and over seasoned beef tongue that came with rice. The flavor was not good at all and I didn't even receive the lettuce I asked for. I should also mention, everyone else's food came out before mine by 5-10 minutes. That's always awkward isn't it?   The Las Vegas roll was ok. My friend's bimbimbap looked interesting but she quickly ran out of meat and had to share another friend's.   I can't see myself ever coming back to this establishment for the super slow service and sad food. And I hate when they include gratuity on your bill but at the bottom of the receipt ask for additional gratuity. Heeeeccccckkkk no you can't have more if I have to wait so long for gross food!"}
{"text":"It's about time to have a Korean style BBQ in North Scottsdale.  It can't measure up to LA or Denver.  But it's definitely nice to not have to drive an hour for this type of food.  I was a little disappointed that they only gave 6 side dishes.  We ordered the Mayo combo.  The meat was fresh and tasty.  The portion is on the light side.  We also ordered two rolls of sushi using Groupon deal.  If you have a big appetite, come Wednesday night for all you can eat sushi and BBQ."}
{"text":"Great value for Korean BBQ. Alex took care of us very well.  I honestly didn't even notice she was refilling the water.  That's some next level service."}
{"text":"Third time here. Ive had a little bit of sushi, Korean food and KBBBQ. So far so good. Not comparable to LA korean food but nothing really is. Glad to have it in north Phoenix/ Scottsdale. Hoping to spread the word to keep them open!"}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant just a Little over a week from opening. We came in and the restaurant had maybe 3-4  tables with customers. We had to call the servers attention all the time to place our orders. There were 3 servers taking orders and bringing food out. It took forever for food to come even if the restaurant was not busy. Taste was mediocre. We thought since it just opened, that's when they will do their best  with food quality and food service. This wasn't true. Really bad experience. We thought that we would finally have a  good Korean restaurant in our side of town. This isn't the case ."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, service sucks! Waiters/waitress are constantly in the back of kitchen. Restaurant wasn't busy at all 3-4 tables. Tip the sushi chef not the service."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for Sushi so I can review that part of the menu. The service was excellent, our server was Brittany, and she was very nice and courteous. The menu for Sushi is reasonably priced and they have a Happy Hour portion [does not apply to Groupon]. We ordered the Thunderbird and the Dynamite rolls. The food came out fresh and the taste was really delicious! The rolls are large and filling I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here few days ago with friend and we both had bimbim bap lunch special, it was delicious! The green ice tea was good as well. Our waitress is so nice and friendly, I will definitely comeback to try for dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed with this place as we've had good experiences with their first location in the past. I appreciated the decor in the restaurant. The more positive aspect included: - BBQ (on the grill): decent quality but small portions Some dishes to take note of: - California Roll: suspiciously cold & grocery-store quality - Banchan: frigid cold temperature with portions the size of a spoonful - Bulgogi: portion is too small for the price when ordered with the Tofu combo, also seemed too watered down - Tofu Soup: not much flavor, veering towards tasteless"}
{"text":"OMG! Robert and I found a new sushi place! The rolls are awesome and I had some barbecue pork that was phenomenal! We are definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"We opted for a leisurely Sunday lunch after an early movie, and chose Ohya for convenience.  We had dined at the Thunderbird location and were familiar with the concept. I liked the decor - comfortable industrial. It wasn't busy, so we had lots of time. The server was prompt and helpful, as the menu differs a bit.   We ordered tempura veggies and the sweet chili edamame - both excellent.  I also love the little dishes of kimchi, pasta and veggies. For dinner, I ordered the udon with chicken, which I really enjoyed.  My husband had katsu pork, and it was good but wasn't quite what he was expecting.   Our guests both had BBQ chicken and spicy pork.  Both excellent.   What cost them stars were related to service.  One meal came out almost 10 minutes after the others. When we asked for lettuce and sauce we received a reaction that seemed like we were asking for something unusual. (These come standard at the Tbird location.). We had asked for limes and never received them. And after we put our leftovers in containers, no one picked up the dirty dishes, even while delivering the check.   So while the food was good, and lots of menu options, the team needs a little more focus on the details."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Korean place in Arizona. I used to manage a Korean restaurant in Chicago and so am very picky. The portions were good. The space wide open. And not dimly lit like most Korean restaurants. I had the Kalbi and my fianc√© had a couple of sushi rolls. She said they were great. The side dishes were great and they replaced them twice. Highly recommend this place especially how it is across the street from the movie theater"}
{"text":"This place is great! I went here after my high school graduation and had the all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. Delicious! Great place and great service!"}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The selection is great, and delicious. Ohya even has $2 Taco Tuesday! They carry a wonderful variety from fresh sushi to Korean BBQ made right infront of you. They linked up with Groupon and have some really affordable deals. I have been here multiple times and always have enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I live in California and I wish they had this place there. I love having sushi and Korean BBQ at the same restaurant. Even better that it's AYCE for $25 at dinner. The servers did a wonderful job. For the Korean BBQ try the lamb and boneless beef rib steaks."}
{"text":"Okay, so we live in chandler and we drove out to this location cause of a recommendation we had gotten from a friend.   First he atmosphere is good, new decor and such. Give a star for that.  The menu was long and the food itself wasnt the best but not bad. Give a star for that as well.  The service is where i take off three stars.  Fyi, there was one other table besides us...  First we sit down and get to ordering right away.  We ordered 2 orders of the tongue,  4 orders of beef brisket, one seafood soup pot(2serving size), and jampong(spicy seafood noodle soup). There is only 5 of us. So with that, its 9 people worth of food!   About 5-10mins later, we get our waters, side dishes, and the meat. But the table grill isn't turned on. We had to ask her. Then she leaves. We don't get plates, napkins, silverware... we grabbed them on our own from the server station next to our table....  we asked for extra side of side dishes because she only brought one set for 5 people... she leaves and doesnt come back with them... we had to ask her several times because she kept forgetting them.   Then when my husband asked for another rice bowl she tells us we will get charged extra $1.50... are you kidding?  We order 9 people worth of food and we get 5 rice cause its 5 people and we get charged for asking 1 more?  So if 1 person orders 3 things off the menu and ask for 2 rice bowl, they get one and get charged one?  What kind of nonsense is that?!   Then we had to track her down in the kitchen cause she would not bring us the check, when we gave her the payment prior to finishing.   Also, party of 5 gets gratuity added too!  We spent $170 on lunch and $27+ tip when we got the worst service ever!   Will not be returning. EVER."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & service! Emily was enthusiastic, attentive & very knowledgeable with great recommendations. Try the Bubba Gump special roll & the Bulgogi. The modestly priced Tini salad was great starter. Fantastic value & great ambience as well make Ohya a fine addition to the Scottsdale 101. Their open on Christmas & New Year's as well!"}
{"text":"We love Korean food, and were so excited to have a restaurant open at our north end of the valley...we tried Korean cuisine the first visit, and sushi the second. The service is lovely, but we are sorry to say the Korean food we ordered is pretty bland. (We did not try the table grill dinner, so cannot comment there.) The sushi was fine, but we have a tastier version elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visited with a Groupon and was not impressed. I have visited the Glendale location many times with my husband and it was a MUCH better experience, every time. This mayo blvd location smelled like sewage when we walked in and the tables were dirty. There was barely anyone in the restaurant and two employees standing around and yet two tables had used dishes on them. After ordering, I watched the sushi chef take the raw fish out of a plastic bag to make our sushi. That doesn't make anyone feel like their fish might be fresh. When we got our rolls, mine was flavorful, but warm. Not cold. My husband's fish was discolored on the edges and he was scared to eat it. He ended up with stomach cramping the entire night. I give this two stars though, because even though our waitress couldn't figure out how to clear the tables, she was sweet and quick to refill our waters."}
{"text":"I was excited to see the new location has opened closer to home. It's beautiful inside with a dinning, bar and grills with vents area. We opted for grilling our own food and ordered the 1st combo. The beef and pork were delicious but the chicken was lacking flavor. We will definitely be returning and I highly recommend people go and support Ohya!"}
{"text":"Ohya?! Oh NO!!!! I am so sad to write this review because I actually liked the fact that it was close to my house and had great pricing but...  I had three items three separate dishes coming from the veggie side cook with black hair in it.  I was okay I'll let one slide as it was in my first dish the salad but it tasted really good so I kindly asked to remake it... the second was in the salad again did they do just toss my salad again and leave the hair in it?!? And bring it back??  The third hair was in the mixed veggies on the bbq as I threw everything on it to simmer. The waiter felt terrible, understood he wasn't cooking but when the manager said with the hair net in hand oh it's because the holes in the hairnet are too large. It's okay we will give you free dessert and only charge half for your food!?!  More appalled by half?!? I couldn't even enjoy the thought of eating any more. The mixed veggies were with the meat on the grill. Said no, we will pay for our two beers and sake and of course tip the waiter 20 bucks but not paying for the food I wasn't able to eat.  So bummed, by the service, literally taking my business elsewhere and encouraging everyone else to Do the same."}
{"text":"This place was closed when the hours stated open. Yet, we called the other location and it was open. There were no signs about them being sorry that they were closed. Already says enough about the business in my opinion."}
{"text":"Place was great and not too packed, granted we did visit in a tuesday. Meat was delicious and so were the sushi rolls. The sushi was especially delicious. I highly recommend the place although the price may throw some people off, it is well worth it at 26$/person. Waitress was very nice and prompt as well. The whole place gave off a very upscale feel."}
{"text":"Walk in with a empty stomach left being full for a weeks. This is the first time my family went to this new location. Let me tell you it won't be our last even if it's an extra ten minute drive. Our waiter \"Kyle\" was probably the best server we had ever had outgoing , patient  and helpful . He deserves a trophy. If you asked us if we are coming back the answer is \"OHYA\"!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean barbecue spot. It's always so unassuming - everybody thinks that it's just a sushi bar and it's kind of tucked away from the other restaurants. I love that it's never too busy or too packed. The pricing isn't too bad either, especially since they offer AYCE (all you can eat) KBBQ, SUSHI, or BOTH!"}
{"text":"food is so good   best jampong ever Quick service and nice ambiance. Happy hour deals are amazinggggggggg"}
{"text":"Amazing rolls and service!!! The Latin Lover and Bubba Gump rolls were my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This place is superb!  Never a wait, probably because it's not been fully discovered yet in Scottsdale.  The location by ASU West has always been solid so it was nice to get one closer to home.  Some of the best sushi rolls are only on the all you can eat (every Wednesday) menu so even if you are mindful of portions, you may want to go with this option.  Their banchan are always good and they've got some interesting ones, like purple potato salad, that I've never seen before.  The tofu soup and bulgogi combo is a great option and is very filling.  Let them help you grill your meats if you're unsure of how.  All the food is really good, really fresh!"}
{"text":"Our server alex was stellar. Didn't have to wait longer than a few minutes to be helped. Price has always been the same over the years, but after the new management, the place has really improved. I used to have to go and refill my own water and rice. After the new management, I am finally treated like a human being again.  Quality of meat is great, and bathrooms are super clean.  I recommend the rib finger meat and the rancho galbi, then finished off with the calamari.  All the servers are great, but Alex is awesome!"}
{"text":"First time eating sushi, and I had a blast. I sat at the bar and the bartender, Emily, helped me have a perfect meal. Her eyes glistened like the shining sun"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Korean food. If you're a fan of Korean food, or in the mood for something different. Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"our bento boxes were cold and chicken wasn't fully cooked. the sushi was ok but not something i wouldn't have a again"}
{"text":"We just tried this place last night - a Saturday night.   My wife and I ordered a combo bbq item and our girls ordered sushi and yakisoba  BBQ comes with an assortment of small side dishes including eggplant, tofu, poi and other items. All were well prepared. You can actually order more of the sides if you want them - but it's not clear initially - so just be aware that you can.  The BBQ also comes with lettuce wraps into which you put the tasty meat that you cook at the table  All of the good was very good and some of it was absolutely on point (cucumber salad, chicken BBQ, tofu, kimchi). The best part though was that, unlike some local Asian places here in Scottsdale, the food was well seasoned - NOT over seasoned.  Too many places here drown everything in a sauce, over salt or just don't get the balance right.  This place was right on target   Kudus!  The service was prompt with just the right level of attention without being overbearing - and was also helpful with suggestions.   The ambiance is pleasant and open and not pretentious."}
{"text":"Great staff, very outgoing and friendly. The appetizers are wonderful as well. We were served our food very quick and efficiently. The boba tea was great as well."}
{"text":"Went here craving some good Korean food. Didn't try the sushi or Japanese items. The menu looked promising as the options were authentic Korean dishes (not new age fusion with cheese etc) but our dishes of duk boki, and spicy pork were a little underwhelming. Tasted over seasoned and pretty salty. There were leftovers and was probably the first time ever that we chose not to take it home. The best tasting dish were their Tuesday deal Korean tacos. Those were more well balanced in flavor and the Bao that the pork belly was wrapped in was soft and not doughy.  Would consider maybe a second try but mostly Becuase there aren't many Korean options in Scottsdale. It's pricey for Korean food."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner tonight! Irene was our server and she was awesome! We had a lot of fun and will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Tried here with 5 friends. We ordered galbi.ribeye. chadol bak e       seafood carasol. dduk bok e. and lots of sojus. Everything was above the average, and atmosphere was very nice. The server was polite, but missed several things what we ordered but it was okay. We had fun time cooking bbq on the table!!  We will go back soon"}
{"text":"Great Place to go for dinner or lunch! Very authentic Korea food and great customer service. We ordered tofu soup and some sushi, it's very tasty. The food are delicious! Will recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends and the all you can eat BbQ and sushi was delicious! Bulgogi was my favorite. And the Dol sot Bibimbap was amazing as well."}
{"text":"My friends & I are from Hawaii & KBBQ is soooo famous there. We're here Arizona for college & we've been craving KBBQ for the longest time & so we decided to try Ohya! We did the all you can eat KBBQ special & the meat was amazing! So glad we were able to to satisfy our KBBQ cravings here!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Lol the lady waitress ran up to me and my uncle when she thought we didn't leave a tip lol because we paid with a credit card and left a tip in cash but she didn't see the tip in cash just the 0 from the credit card , she really ran up to us and said the tip wasn't included lol like the service was up to par to even get tip   Never not tipped but never had a server run up to me asking for one smh never come back here again just on that note"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday and the service was AWFUL we left before we even ordered because the woman that was working hadn't been to our table in about 15 minutes. We came back the next day on a Monday to use our Groupon again, at lunch and the young man that was working provided GREAT service! And food was great. So would come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo with the Grilled salmon and the specialty roll. I ordered the dynamite roll. I also ordered a cup of miso soup. My grilled salmon was brought out by a different server and i mentioned i also ordered soup. Next my dynamite roll was brought out by my server. He said the miso soup is homemade so I would probably get it at the end. The server was nice enough and i tipped him decrnt because i can only assume he wasnt trained properly on how to but in an appetiser or soup ahead of the order to space it out properly. Everything tasted fine. Next time, i will explain the order of entrees. And, by the way, it wasnt busy at all."}
{"text":"In my entire life, this was by far the poorest service I've ever received at any restaurants, in the world. The biggest problem might be that they are severely understaffed. They just plop the meat on the table, don't explain which meat is what. We had to remind the server a few times to finally have some our food, and it was difficult to get his attention. The menu is \"old\" and not updated so the price you are charged on some things are different from what it says on the menu. Go ANYWHERE ELSE for Korean BBQ and sushi in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Go anywhere but here.   I've given this place 3 chances already & my 3rd time being the last. Each time has gotten progressively worse. The only times I go to Ohya is when I'm having my KBBQ cravings & want to make the drive from Gilbert to Scottsdale. I come with the benefit of the doubt since I know they're not going to be like California's KBBQ restaurants but this place is a sad excuse for even attempting to be one. Quality of the meat isn't good & service is horrible. The only thing I like about this restaurant is the look.   For some meats, they were abnormally chewy & had more fat than meat on them. The quality of the meat wasn't as big of a deal for me as the service though. (Which should make up for the food not being good)  For the service, they take forever to help you & when they finally do, they disappear for like 10-15mins at a time. I don't understand what they could possibly be doing in the back. Especially for AYCE since all they have to do is just bring the meat & occasionally change out the grill. They never check up on you or refill waters/side dishes. When they suddenly come out of hiding it's annoying because when you try to get their attention they're looking down at the ground or ignoring you because they're too lazy to help or just want to hurry & get to the back again. Don't get me wrong, they're nice & all but the service is a complete joke. (Note: the last time I went was the worse service I've gotten & it was a slow Wednesday night at around 10pm)   They also have a board inside the restaurant that shows their AYCE/Happy Hour & it is a huge false advertisement. Overall, I do not recommend this restaurant. The owner is running this place to the ground."}
{"text":"Went here for late night KBBQ. I was not impressed. Meat wasn't very fresh or appetizing and this place honestly wasn't the cleanest. They also close at 1am, but when we got there around 12:30 they told us we couldn't do all you can eat. Most KBBQ places know to stay open late so I didn't like this.   I would rather wait than return here for KBBQ. I also know there are other places opening up across the valley."}
{"text":"OK, maybe I am just not properly calibrated to the sushi scene in the Scottsdale area. Scottsdale has the rep of being a bit pricey for most things - at least that was what I thought.  We stopped in to Ohya for lunch and found that their sushi was very good and the prices on the lunch special fantastic. The menu describes several sushi lunch specials - one includes 6 pieces of nagiri, choice of 1 of 4 rolls (I went with spicey crab) and includes miso soup and salad for $9.95. But wait, there's more. When the food arrived there was also a small portion of edemame, a small spring roll, and a shrimp tempura as well. That's a lot of food for $10. Not sure if they do this all the time but it was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a double date and we decided to go here since we had a groupon. We ordered our food and a pork dish was recommended stating that it was the best dish on the menu.  The pork slices were all straight fat it was disgusting, we couldn't find a sliver of actual meat. I took a bite and felt like throwing up, it was like someone throw in all the fatty parts of bacon into the dish. Our friends ordered the sushi, after 50 min and several inquiries they received 2, 5 piece rolls. The waitress after not checking in on us came back and gave us our checks. Then I noticed her checking on our table every 3 min to see if we had paid rolling her eyes every time she walked by. Like it was our fault that it took an hour to get our sushi rolls. Not worth the money the food, ambience and service was terrible."}
{"text":"If you like Korean BBQ then you know you have to be prepared to wait (45 mins-2hr) when you show up at most restaurants as they typically do not take call ahead/reservations.  We chose this spot as they were the only ones we could find that took reservations and could accommodate a party size of 4 on a Friday night.   The restaurant has regular tables and also BBQ grill tables so make sure you confirm what u. The setup of the tables literally puts you almost at the neighboring table with only a little of space, so when we sat down we felt like we were triple dating with the couple next to us. Luckily I'm super social so I joke with them and vice versa.   You're allowed to order 3 items at a time which we did but was rather surprised as it seem to take a long time in-between each of the request to bring out the next items. I believe you have 15 or 16 items to choose from for the price. Some of the items were frozen and not as fresh as expected. Given that you have only 90 mins (which was emphasized a few times) our expectation was to have the food flowing with frequent check-ins but that didn't happen. We would finish off a set of items and turn down our own grill to minimize the smoking/burning and start from scratch with a new grill. The one item I was looking forward to that didn't impress was the calamari. I usually order 2 or 3 times, but after the 1st it left me bored. The Bulgogi (Daeji & Lamb) were good, along with the Chadol & Shrimp.The Jumuluck & NY Strip Steak were also good.   Staff did a good job but it could've been better as we kept feeling like we were always looking for a server to simply enhance our experience. In particular tongs, seasoning, and salad.   Bar selection is somewhat limited as some of our requests seemed to be just one ingredient away from being the perfect cocktail.  I'm planning to return back for lunch or dinner as they also have sushi but hoping the overall service improves."}
{"text":"The food is good, service was not bad. My complaint is do not come to this place and use their groupons. Too many stipulations. Avoid a headache, to make matters more interesting, The manager brushed our complaint like it wasn't important. Next time when someone suggest that all of their party's would be using a groupon. Maybe bring it to the customer attention that they could only use one groupon. Aside of the manager, the waitress was professional and attentive..."}
{"text":"BBQ???????????sushi ????????????????????????????????????????BBQ????????"}
{"text":"We didn't do the self BBQ and just ordered from the menu. It was good but I'd like to go back and try the BBQ. Staff is friendly. All around good place. It did take our waitress longer than anyone would prefer to get to our table, nothing to complain about really. The place wasn't packed and she told us she thought they were out of menus. None the less she found some without issue. All in all the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"It's hard to find AYCE KBBQ in Phoenix so we were grateful to find this place. It's a nice restaurant with a good ambiance. It's clean and well appointed.  However, coming from CA we're used to a different KBBQ experience. Right off we were informed of the ground rules: 1.5 hour max (unusual) and we're billed for uneaten excess (that's normal). Ok ... Fine we get it.  The menu is somewhat limited and there's no option to order premium without sushi.  Asked for a refill on NY steak and the second round came with one instead of two. According to our server that's because they're avoiding waste.... But I thought the financial penalty was supposed to cover that. Not to mention there are 5 of us and we just started eating.  Overall a C experience but the controlling parent thing is a bit of a turn off.   I was able to write this review waiting for a refill on our order, btw."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was a small restaurant in Glendale and have seen it grow. This one is large, fancy, modern, I really like the inside and location."}
{"text":"I was really appalled by tonight's service. Took 10 mins for someone to notice us at the hostess stand and there was no hostess. We were finally seated and ordered. When we got our food a different server came, dropped it off and left. I noticed it wasn't the meat we ordered and when she came back 3 mins later we had told her that and she told us that she couldn't take it back because it was meat and it was already placed in front of us. We hadn't started grilling it, we hadn't even touched it, i had told her ..but that wasn't what we wanted? (Because we had no idea what it was in the first place)  and she kept telling us over and over what it was in Korean and i thought to myself yes i can read the menu i see what it says but in ENGLISH we dont know what it is? what if i cant eat this? she didn't care and she left. it was busy and we were hungry so we just ate it. (whatever it was) the original server came twice during our 1 hour meal. in that hour they forgot our rice, our lettuce, our scissors to cut the meat (which our meat burned, in the mean time while waiting for the scissors) took 20 mins to bring us more hot water. they didn't bring us the right sauce, nor did they bring us butter or refill our drinks. She left us for a while and didnt come back because she was busy with her other BIGGER tables as if our table did not matter. Our first time here and it was just awful!  I would like management to contact me ASAP."}
{"text":"I gave Ohya this rating not because the food wasn't good but kitchen service was poor! My husband's ordered came out so far ahead of mine that he was finished eating before I was served. We were about to ask for the check & ditch the Poke Bowl when it arrived, so my hunger overruled my pride. The garlic edamame was excellent! The Salmon Bento was OK, salmon tasted frozen but glaze was yummy. My very late Poke Bowl was yummy w/spicy shrimp, seaweed salad, cucumber & cherry tomatoes.   May give this place another try but not sure!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first Korean dinner experience immensely. Fun, trendy, delicious food. We will definitely be back sooner than later. Korean BBQ is rather like tepan table, but you cook you it own meat!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have all you can eat special 7 days a week! Meat quality is very good and they give a different variety of korean side dishes everyday so they are freshly made. Our server was super sweet and got everything we needed out fastly. They even changed our tabletop grill in good timing without us even having to ask. Highly recommend this place, they also have numerous korean entrees to choose from. My favorite thing to get from here is the bbq combos with peach soju. Love this place, cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Slow night today at Ohya on a Saturday. Server was very nice and helpful! Her name was Jade. we had the all you can eat Korean BBQ tonight. Can't wait to come back! Very yummy."}
{"text":"I was so proud to hear that they had sushi and Korean BBQ all you can eat in Arizona. But it was so GHETTO. they had 90 min time limit !!!!! That's NOT the ALL YOU CAN EAT !!!. Also, worst, poorest and very slow Service. side dishes looks reused. they served bad quality meat. unsavory taste dishes. Everything was not Okay. I won't never come back here."}
{"text":"They sat us down right away on a Saturday night :-) My friends and I came here over Gen because we won't have to wait as long. Plus, you cannot turn down all-you-can-eat kbbq!"}
{"text":"It's a large restaurant, bar area, sushi bar area, Korean bbq tables and regular tables. Service was friendly and efficient. The menu is HUGE, lots of options! I went with a spicy vegetable and squid dish, my hubby ordered a traditional bibim bap bowl and we split the gangster sushi roll. I enjoyed my meal! Spicy, lots of food and came with some sides (rice, kimchi etc). My hubby said the bibim bap was good but had a small portion of meat. He would not order it again. The sushi roll was also decent, no complaints on that. Overall food was good, not outstanding. Decent pricing for a Korean bbq restaurant, we will probably be back. If you check in on yelp you get a free dessert of mochi, we passed on it tonight but it looks super cute and photo worthy!"}
{"text":"I first stopped by during their grand opening. I was excited for another Ohya since I enjoyed dining at the T-Bird location.   We noticed it wasn't as busy as the other location. We stopped by on a Friday night for a Bday dinner. It was pretty sad to see it so quiet. This restaurant is huge, great vibe, nice bar, and patio. However, the food quality and prices just not the same as the T-bird location. Our waitress was awesome handling our demanding group.   I tried the Golden Alaska Roll. A good amount baked salmon on top. It looked like chicken though. It was decent but had much better ones. They offered this roll on their all day happy hour section.   Suggestion to the owner: add karaoke."}
{"text":"The bulgogi fries are to die for!!! Bibim bap is delicious as well...went three times this past week and enjoyed the ambiance and the food. Great hangout after work and for happy hours"}
{"text":"Fried rice was more like fried rice soup. The rice was so mushy I honestly thought it was baby food.  The price of everything was cheap however you get way you pay for. Food tasted cheap and I was. Would never go back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Food was spectacular.  My new favorite place!!!!!   Randi the server was so knowlegeful and made it very easy to understand the menu for a first time like me.  We will be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place will for sure return for sure, grills work great and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in at 6:54 on a Tuesday night 1/2/18, half the restaurant was empty aside from 2 groups of 2 people sitting in the entrance.  I assumed they were waiting for takeout.  6 minutes later, after I made eye contact with everyone working there except the buser, a young waitress asked if I had been helped.  I told her I'd like to eat.  She said it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  Now, the thought that crossed my mind was literally, \"if I have to wait 10-15 minutes just to sit in a restaurant that is half empty, I might die before getting served with food.\"  The place looked nice enough but it seems they have a huge staffing problem coupled with a certain inattentiveness.  Next..."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's birthday, and the food was delicious. Absolutely love that it's all you can eat korean bbq and sushi!! Not many places like this one in Arizona. We had great service from our waiter Tyler. He was very attentive and accommodating. Definitely recommend for a good time!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time,  and found ourselves repeatedly yelling out, \"OH YA!!!\" HAHAHA. But seriously, this place made us happy with having both sushi and Korean food options. Service was a little slow, but we weren't in a rush. Galbi was yummy. Sushi rolls were on point. Do not get thr ramen. Big mistake on my poor hubby's part. He was so excited to see ramen on the menu but noooo....it was not good. We will be back if in the area for sushi and korean food though!"}
{"text":"It's what I get for not wanting to drive to the best Korean place, Cafe Ga Hyang, on a Sunday evening. Subpar food, cold restaurant, and crappy service.  First, the ambiance is sterile and cold. The place is cavernous with dark concrete floors and a very, very high industrial-looking black ceiling. It's echo-y and designed poorly. Plus it was literally cold. People at other tables were wearing jackets and I kept mine on through most of our meal. There was another restaurant in this location before Ohya and it looks as if when Ohya bought the place, they spent the minimum amount necessary to furnish and decorate it.  Secondly - and most importantly - I ordered a sauteed vegetable and bulgogi steak bibim bap. It came out in a white bowl which meant, as I surmised when I saw it, that the dish was served cold. It was a pretty cold night in January and the last thing I wanted was cold food. I told the food runner that brought it that I was unaware the dish was served cold and would he please return it to the kitchen and bring me what my husband was having which was a galbi dolsot bibim bap (served sizzling in a hot stone bowl).  Now, that should have been the last we heard about it. There was absolutely no need to have any further discussion except for maybe a quick follow up from our server acknowledging she knew about the change and that the food would be brought as soon as it was ready.  Instead, our server came over and proceeded to subtly find fault with me for not looking at the picture of the food, seeing the white bowl in the picture, and inferring for myself that that meant it was served cold. I pointed out that the description of the dish includes \"SAUTEED\" which to most people I know, means \"COOKED\". And \"COOKED\" usually means \"HOT\"... or at least warm. My husband and I also pointed out that on the opposite page of the menu, the Japanese items that were served cold had \"COLD\" in their titles. The point being, it's easy to assume that if some menu items are clearly noted that they're served cold, then any cold menu item would follow the same pattern.  So here we find ourselves in this uncomfortable and awkward conversation that shouldn't even be happening in the first place. Feeling like we needed to justify why we didn't realize the dish was cold while the girl serving us CONTINUED to push blame. At any point she could've said, \"Ohhhh I see what you mean...\" and just left it at that, but she had to make us wrong because she obviously felt like this was somehow a situation that required someone being at fault and by god it wasn't going to be her.   I could have cared less that I had to place another order - so what? It happens. Blame doesn't need to be introduced into that scenario, but this unprofessional server obviously didn't feel that way. And for that, I won't be returning. Plus, the food leaves plenty to be desired. Overly sweetened side dishes, didn't taste fermented (or home made for that matter), and bland bibim bap.  For truly authentic Korean food and experience, we'll stick to our go-to hole in the wall in Glendale which is the best we've found in this area - Cafe Ga Hyang."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely incredible!!! My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork Korean bbq which was delicious. We ordered four specialty sushi rolls. The sushi was taking a longer time than normal and our server, Simon, continued to apologize for the length of time that it took. He told us that they were unable to make one of the sushi rolls because one of the fish items they were out of. We told him that it was no problem. Simon came back and told us that he had taken care of our ENTIRE MEAL! We felt awful because the food was sooo great and authentic it was not his fault at all. We will definitely be back!! Thank you Simon."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Love the atmosphere. We were seated beneath a cherry blossom tree with lanterns. The staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The door says this restaurant is open until 2 AM, but if you go there after midnight, they tell you the kitchen is closed. So I asked them what they can do after 12, and they say, \"nothing. Sorry.\" they are effectively lying about their hours of operation."}
{"text":"First time here and it didn't disappoint will definitely be coming back for more. Service was good and friendly, since it was our first time here we asked a lot of questions, they were very patient with us and made our dinner enjoyable. Thank you"}
{"text":"Worst Korean Bbq we have gone to.  We are originally from CA and NV, we know Kbbq.  Our first clue that it was going to be bad as the almost empty place on a Friday evening.  O Place is expensive for AYCE kbbq, and the food is mediocre.  Service was slow."}
{"text":"Last night was my second, and sadly, last time here. Bought the $9 for $20 sushi deal. Great deal but the sushi was mediocre. Dry overcooked octopus, dried out piece of shrimp. Fish was ok and the guy at the sushi bar was friendly, although not too experienced. In fact, he's whyvtge second star."}
{"text":"Will never go here again. I used to be a regular, but after the last visit I will not be returning. There was a fire at a nearby table during our ayce session and they sprayed the fire extinguisher tainting our food and making us feel sick. After that experience, they didn't even honor the 25% off coupon they sent to my email. They removed all the good sushi rolls of the ayce menu leaving basically different versions California rolls.... never again."}
{"text":"Great sushi, spectacular prices.  Fire cracker appetizer is sure to please your belly.   If you haven't checked this place out, I'd recommend it. Minutes away from Harkins, Cyclebar, and Bowlero bowling alley."}
{"text":"How do you come here at 3pm on taco Tuesday,  but there's no more pork belly tacos bc they're out of bao buns?   There's only three choices.   Wow.   We've tried this place a few times now and have been disappointed every time.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Since the first time eating at the Thunderbird location years ago, I thought the AYCE KBBQ was bland and terrible. Since then I've given the Scottsdale location 3 more tries, today's visit being my last. Since I was raised in LA, I think I've been spoiled by the restaurants there, but whatever they're doing here is completely wrong including the service.  My girlfriend was craving AYCE KBBQ, so having no other options we came to OHYA. Meat quality was terrible as usual. The porkbelly had more fat on them than meat. The beef tongue and and thin beef slices were abnormally chewy. The side dishes and amount of sauce given were scarce.  Service was a joke. The waitress was kind but everything had to be asked for. When we began our meal she didn't provide scissors for us to cut the meat for a while. Water was never once refilled. We were never really asked to see how we're doing other than for when she took our paper for our meat orders. Keep in mind it was a very slow wednesday night around 10pm with barely any other tables. She would disappear for a good 10 minutes at a time, and it seemed that other tables were waiting long as well.  Lastly, when we were ready to close up, she charged us for the full price of $24.95 per person for sushi and BBQ. We didn't even have sushi. On the white board set up at the entrance of the restaurant, it advertised that the AYCE has a reverse happy hour after 9pm from Monday-Thursday, hence why we came tonight. However, when I questioned our waitress about the price, she said the deal doesn't apply today so I told her that their sign said so. Afterwards she said she'd speak with her manager, and came back saying that deal only applies Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Since it's only in total an $8 difference I didn't want to argue, but was disappointed that they would falsely advertise right in their restaurant. If the deal really didn't apply to Wednesday nights we would've came on one of the other days.  I guess it's time to patiently wait for Gen BBQ to open up in Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"This Ohya location is headed downhill; I'm really disappointed because I like the location. First off I haven't been here in a while because last couple times I was here, I wasn't too impressed. Today, I thought I try it out again to update my review.  Their Thunderbird location caters to Koreans while this locations caters more to Americans and young adults because of their large bar area and small plates. The food at Thunderbird location is really good. I wish they'd pay more attention to side dishes here. I mean, come on...it's the side dishes that come out first when you place your order. Of course, being hungry you taste every side dish. Last few times I come here, at least one of them are on the verge of spoilage or have turned the corner. That's not the way to start a meal.  We ordered budae chigae (2 servings). My poor husband ordered this to share with our son. This dish is meant to be cheap and plentiful but it was neither. They were still hungry after they finished it. The flavor was equal to the instant ramen noodles with added hot dogs, spam, kimchee, and tofu.  I ordered galbi dolsot bibimbap. Please Ohya! You have to marinade each of the ingredients before plating this dish. Each vegetable was over cooked mush with absolutely no taste and no texture. Did I mention sprouts were spoiled too? I removed that out of my bowl and mixed in my sauce. Needless to say, I didn't get to finish it and no one in my table wanted to eat it. Did I also mention this lunch wasn't cheap? It was $44 for those 2 dishes alone? I wouldn't return here for korean food. The only reason for the 3 stars is their bbq.  So, guess where we headed to after this meal? You got it! In & Out burgers, baby!"}
{"text":"The dinner price is such a good deal. Better and cheaper price than some Korean BBQs I've been to in CA."}
{"text":"This was our second time at OHYA.  The first time was late evening on a weekend and this time was lunch on a weekday.  Definitely a different vibe.  Service was good, though I think the ONE waitress was spread too thin.   She was courteous and we appreciate that.  We also applaud her Japanese language skills, since we were all Japanese at the table.  Half of us had the Udon Tempura (soup) Ample portioned and though I didn't taste the tempura, it looked pretty good.  We also ordered edamame for the table and gyoza.  Thumbs up!  Tea was plentiful and hot.  The other half of us had BiBimBap.  Also well portioned and nicely accompanied by kimchi.  The bill for 6 of us was $133.00......for lunch.  I didn't pick apart the receipt, but that seems high for lunch, in a big picture kind of way.  Just sayin.  Our third trip will be on  a Wednesday for AUCE.  I'll update!"}
{"text":"Had a karaoke bday party for my daughter there . When u walk in the smell of sewage was very offensive to the point where I almost took my 25+ party to a different restaurant. We were able to shut the door in the karaoke room and I had some body spray to help out too . The server was very polite but when it came time to pay the checks $43 came up missing so we basically paid for one ticket twice . Also forced me to pay for 3 premium rolls that were not ordered . The manager at the time seemed pissed off that I needed help w the karaoke machine that was entirely in Korean. even the machines are in Korean so very hard to work . The Mics they have are wireless and were dead 30 min into our party and I had rented the room for 2 hours . The sushi was yuck . Maybe because our order was very large but it tasted old . Most of us that ordered Sushi did not even eat it ."}
{"text":"First time here for the AYCE K-BBQ & sushi and it was the worst experience ever! They give you a 90 minute time limit which is understandable, but when our time was almost up, the server rushed us. I was so annoyed for that because she wouldn't have had to rush us if the service was better. We were sat and didn't get any service until about 15 mins later. Our food took forever to come out, they give you small portions of ginger and wasabi even when you ask for more. Her response was \"we premake these for the shifts so that's all it comes with.\" Then, in the middle of eating I saw a big cockroach running across the floor next to me. I inform the server and manager of this and the server comes back and tells me it's a beetle and not a cockroach. First of all, I don't care what it is especially if I see it running around next to me. When we were done, we had asked for our check from our server. About 20 mins pass by and she still didn't bring it to us so we asked another staff member. We still never got the check so we asked the manager until he finally brought it to us. We were literally there for 3 hours. The service was just horrible! Never again am I coming back here!"}
{"text":"I might go back but I think I would like to try other Korean restaurant in the area if there are any.   It wasn't bad and it was tasty but I have had better.  The service was average.  Four of us sat at the grill and ordered appetizers at happy hour prices and started off with 2 plates of steak we each received our own sauces but we were never offered refills.  We also received 4 side dishes which we would ask for refills but never offered. We then ordered another meat dish.  Again the food was good and worth eating there."}
{"text":"I can't.  We've been here a few times and the place seems to be getting worse.  Service was great which is why they got a 2nd star, but the AYCE was terrible.  The meat seemed old and it was all very tasteless.  We thought maybe the 1st round was just bad so we tried different meats for round 2, and it was the same.  We couldn't make it to round 3.  The galbi meat was not red and radiant, but brown.  The restaurant is really nice looking, but that's about it.  It was also pretty empty for dinner time as well. I wish these places could do well but if you're cheaping out on the meats, that's not the way to go especially when Gen is in town."}
{"text":"Ohya Sushi and Korean Grill and Bar  We have been looking for a Korean BBQ Restaurant in the Phoenix area and better yet in North Scottsdale. We have been going to different ones in San Diego and San Francisco, but nothing here until now.  Ohya offers the choice to have them cook with set dinner plates or order your meats and cook at the table on the table burner.  We choose to cook our selection of meats.  We ordered the following meats - Bulgogi, (Thinly sliced BBQ Beef Marinated in a House Special Sauce), Chadol Baegi (Non Marinated thin sliced Beef Brisket) and Sam Gyup Sai (Sliced Pork Bellies Marinated in Special Wine Sauce). All meats came out uncooked for us to do, on a plate well decorated and impressive presentation with a generous amount of meat on each plate.   With the different dipping sauces,  the Bulgogi did not need to add any sauces as the marinate provided all the flavors you would need in a great flavor.  The Chadol Baegi came non marinated and I enjoyed using the sauce that resembled a ketchup/salsa style flavor.  The Sam Gyup Sai meat was marinated in a special wine sauce which was good by itself.   Being the first time here we ordered a conservative selection of meats that were less expensive,  going back I would like to try the Galbi Short Ribs, Ribeye Steak or Lamb Bulgogi.   I liked how the meats came out with onions, mushrooms and you could add garlic cloves.  My family totally enjoyed our experience and my daughter asked of we could celebrate her birthday here with our immediate side of 22. Which is a total compliment to the restaurant.   We arrived for a late dinner at 8:45 pm on Black Friday and there were a total of 4 different tables which 3 were occupied by Asians which I find is an excellent example that it is pretty good and authentic.   In talking to the waitress who was very good, I asked her about the Wednesday special that was on a white board at the entry and she said it was every Wednesday, All You Can Eat, All Meats for $25 per person which includes 2 different sushi selections also. We will definitely come back to try it.  I was amazed that the restaurant opens till 2:30 am, but the location is not a very good visible area and from the outside the lights are so dim that it is questionable whether it is open.  Just be prepared to wait a little if you are ordering to cook at your table because it takes time to prepare the meat plates that you order which are presented very nice.  We came back for the Wednesday all you can eat and waited for 25 minutes to be seated. When ordering, the amount of meat that comes out is different than ordering Ala Carte. They don't give you the fancy well decorated plate, it is just placed on a plate and brought out, don't understand why they were so backed up. Would recommend as soon as you place your order on the burner to place another order because of the time it takes to bring out the order. Would recommend the Galbi with bones, bulgobi, ribeye and Shrimp. The sushi was the biggest surprise with a good variety of different sushi, beware the orders are huge which I expected to be a few pieces.   Will definitely be back and look forward to the all you can eat on Wednesday!"}
