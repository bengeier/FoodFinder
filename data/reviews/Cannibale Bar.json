{"text":"A bit on the dark side for eating (lighting)  but fast friendly service. Check it out :)  great sandwiches,  excellent hay day heffenwieser brew. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Barbershop by day, speakeasy by night, this watering hole in the circa 1912 Cannibale Block centers around a Prohibition theme. We sat outside on the East-facing patio, which is semi-closed in and due to orientation does not get direct sun. That being said, the nice wood finishes, overhead heaters, and Edison style lights are very inviting for late al fresco drinking/dining.  The drink menu consists largely of cocktails, and while you can get classics like Manhattans, they focus on their own interpretation of prohibition & tiki drinks. They also have unusual, made up stuff like a corn drink. All of the liquors used are top shelf, making their $10-14 price easier to swallow (no pun intended). The consensus at the table was that the drinks were well prepared, but the recipes didn't wow us. A punch that takes two (or three?) days to make, using milk as a clarifying agent, tasted strongly of pineapple and not too much else. It was impressively clear, but also clearly missing some spice or bitters. My other two drinks were similar...nothing to complain to the waiter about, just a bit underwhelming given the menu descriptions.  If you want to order a classic drink, or prefer high end liquor with simpler flavor profiles in your cocktails, you'll love Cannibale. If you like complex-tasting cocktails, come here for a nightcap on the sweet nocturnal patio.  [Note: food looks good, but will have to come back and update the review]"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. Great cocktails. Great atomsphere friendly staff.  Haven't tried any food yet but i will soon. I also want to go for a shave but seems a little pricey.   Only negative is the amount of clutter on the bar.  Check this spot out."}
{"text":"A barber shop moonlighting as a bar? Sure, why not!  Throw some delectable cocktails with unique names like Jungle Bird, Pimmy Gibbler or English Milk Punch and a bartender that is a doppleganger of Jude Law and you've got me hooked.  The dimly lit space has a laid back and welcoming feel. They also have a huge patio space that I'm sure will be occupied throughout the summer.  Definitely a place I'd recommend if you're looking for somewhere cool to catch up with some friends or after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"Cannibale is the 3rd in the successful series of family-owned diner/restaurants here in Calgary. The others are the well-known and relentlessly popular Dairy Lane diner and the Blue Star diner.   Cannibale is a different concept: a \"speak easy\" fronted by a barbershop. In side it's  cozy and inviting. Not unlike Dairy Lane and Blue Star, it's casually elegant, and tasteful. You could easily miss the attention to detail. Again like its sister venues, they specialize in excellence in value and service delivered in a friendly, casual, welcoming style. Don't mistake the casual style with a casual approach to business -- they never miss a beat when it comes to their  service which is impeccable. Staff are knowledgeable about their offerings, ready to help with recommendations.   Nifty as is the concept for this joint, there's no pretension. As with the other restaurants, the owner is often around, and always has a welcoming smile. Personally, I admire a boss like this who  leads by example, and is never above joining it with serving, bussing or slinging a mop.   After going there the first time, 2 weeks ago, I've been back two more times. I've enjoyed a few among a good selection of beers, and have yet to try their other beverages, but look forward to exploring some of those.   For food, I've enjoyed the charcuterie plate, the Rueben made with duck, and the Cuban sandwich, as well as a couple of deserts. The quality of the offerings is exceptional! Gourmet level, I thought. Am I going too far? You tell me.   Not just a unique concept for Calgary, this is a comfortable, warm and inviting place to hang out for a drink and a snack, get a hair cut while there if you like, have dinner with friend or business colleague. I think this is going to be a regular hang out for me. See you down there!"}
{"text":"This cosy little pub offers an amazing cocktail menu (honestly there are too many to choose from!) as well as good quality wines and some good value beer on tap. We also ordered the beef carpaccio, and it was awesome. This is a fantastic spot for a cocktail and some nibbles!"}
{"text":"excellent service and food awaits this little hidden gem in bridgeland memorial.  Quality local foods used to prepare well portioned and great tasting mains and appys.  Drinks are phenominal made from scratch the old school way   great relaxing environment.   Love love love this place"}
{"text":"Epic proper \"your-grandad-would-approve\" cocktails. If you're a gin person, I recommend the Artillery cocktail. Great atmosphere and reasonably priced. We will return!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood. Cocktails are solid. Davy Jones locker and Banish the Ghosts are yummy.  The food is a welcoming surprise here. The duck Reuben sandwich is delicious and the cheese board had good accompaniments. Wonderful patio in the summer and great cozy booths make this one of my favorite lounges. Unpretentious and fun, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great atmosphere. Cozy and very cool.  It's a drink place - not a food place (per se) - they have very limited appies and nothing really for meals... Definitely a cocktail bar!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for drinks on a Saturday night- I skipped dinner at home, to leave space to eat the duck Reuben I had been eyeing, in anticipation of checking this place out.  Loved the casual vibe, wasn't too loud and my friend and I were able to converse without too much yelling (I feel so old writing that part).  There is a barbershop at the entrance of the place - how interesting to walk by.  Cocktails were pricy at around $15 but again, I am old and remember the days cocktails were less than $10.  Back to the duck Reuben - it was delicious - flavoured nicely against the sauerkraut and held together with a hearty loaf of bread.  I'd come back here if the opportunity presents again."}
{"text":"This is a place to go for a cocktail and a quick bite but not if you want to have a dinner. The atmosphere is hard to put up with if you want to carry a conversation. The restaurant is always quite full and loud. The staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"Love it here! Great patio space, creative cocktails, and have always had good service. I've been in a few times so not sure why I haven't reviewed it ages ago! Food menu is limited, but good. That's ok though, because you come here for cocktails, which they do superbly! They will even entertain you if you ask for \"bartender's choice\" and bring you a mystery drink!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar for some good cocktails and small plates. I asked the waitress for their best bourbon drink and she came back with an awesome smokey cocktail. Also had the Cubano sandwich and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Really cute patio. Server was genuine and nice. She seemed new. Her knowledge of the menu and suggestions for drink and food options could use a bit of improvement.  Tried a cocktail and glass of pinot noir. Both were tasty. Would return to try more cocktails. Music was on point! We shared the charcuterie board and thought that all the sections tasted good but could have used a different type of cracker or bread (there was only 1) and a sweet spread or accompaniment. Board was served with a soprasetto, prosciutto and a salami with sourkraut grainy mustard and a couple varieties of house pickles (beans and traditional sweet cuces)  Other food looked tasty coming out."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up at Cannibale Bar after dinner on our 5th anniversary, and it was an excellent way to complete the night. The cocktails were great, and the patio made for a fun spot to hang out. I would recommend checking out this place, especially when the weather is good, and you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"English Milk Punch (or any milk punch) and Pretzel Bread Pudding are the two reasons I go here. The bar and location are great. The staff/bartenders are knowledgeable and charming. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this posh, barber shop style bar. I was greeted immediately by the friendly bar tender when I walked in and was able to get a patio table (alfresco style) cleared for me right away when I asked if I could have my party of 6 there. We lucked out with the 20 degree weather this past Thanksgiving weekend but their heat lamps kept us warm and comfortable when there were periods of light evening breeze.  I ordered the English Milk Punch which contained 11 ingredients including rum, brandy, sherry, pineapple, lemon, star anise, cloves, earl grey, demerara and milk. I was concerned that there was way too much going on in this drink but the server assured me that it would be delight and boy was she right. Sally was a happy girl that night."}
{"text":"A group of four of us came here for some drinks and a snack. We tried several of the cocktails and they were all very good.  We tried two of the sandwiches and the charcuterie board and was impressed by how good the food was.  Why I gave this place four stars is because we asked for the bill when they cleared our food away and we waited for more than 20 minutes and ended up going to the bar to find the server to pay. However, we assume that was a one off night for service, we would still come back."}
{"text":"I loved the drink jungle bird! And at 7.00 for 2 oz on happy hour is fantastic!! My hubby had a shot laphroiag scotch 5.00 on happy hour and he really liked it!! Nice bartender and we had the grilled cheese with steak and red peppers was very good, coleslaw is extra but fantastic not heavy but light!!  Reason for 4 star rating is too yuppie for me... younger crowd sitting at bar, and service died down a little when all the young crowd showed up! Nice small cozy atmosphere, but not my style!! Going to next happy hour cocktail place...  And no wifi!!  We came back a week later to try something new! Let you know how it was!!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. It had great music, ambiance, crowd, drink list, food, everything you could ask for.   If you want a cool downtown type vibe, this place is one for the books.   We had the Carpaccio and the beef tartar and they were both delicious. They sprinkle TRUFFLE powder on their tartar making it a MUST have in my opinion... oh it was heaven.   I had this really delicious drink that had a floral taste with chamomile in it. They had such a unique drink list of many different flavours and styles. If you like trying new cocktails then check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Got a haircut for myself while my husband got a beard trim and head buzz. Yan is great, and I highly recommend him!  Ordered the Apple Orchard, Short Wave pale ale and a sourdough pretzel - all delicious. The better half had some whiskey for which the bartender, Mark, offered some insight as to what to order. Staff here overall is excellent - highly recommend for food, drinks and a cut!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and a large variety of food/beverage options. Loved the vibe inside and it's pretty neat they have a barber shop attached. Service was good but we felt pretty rushed by our server. Definitely a good stop if you're feeling a little more upscale. They have a nice little patio as well. Parking is a little difficult as you have to be able to find a spot on the street. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food was aweful. The service was even worse. The attitude that came from the girl serving us was ridiculous. I had tried two white wines that were different. Both tasted the same and were sour. They clearly used an old bottle.   The girl kept rolling her eyes when she served us. When we wanted to order more drinks and water my gf went up to the bar and the bar tender handed her a jug of water and said they were really busy. Wow. Never again!!"}
{"text":"The food here is better than most drinking bars... We had the carpaccio and the cheese plates to share and both were very good.. The wine was ok.. Nothing really impressive, but not terrible... I just not recommend ordering the house wine..., other wines are ok.. The ambience is very good, and the service was great.. In average the place was good.."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has the most amazing Asian sub. It is filled with pulled beef and a super delicious sauce I can't seem to figure out.   I literally crave this sub often and when I crave it I have to go.  Great dark atmosphere with cool hip staff and even a barber.  Great neighbourhood gem.  Steve"}
{"text":"Probably the coolest bar I have ever been to. That isn't fair ....this is an old-school lounge. Amazing place gre at food incredible atmosphere.thisbplace is not to be missed.  It is small but the seating is comfortable and the staff is super friendly.   New favorite place"}
