{"text":"Alright!! I love this Bagel caf√©; if you're looking for a moderately sized place with low ambient noise to get some coffee or a bagel sandwich, then you're in luck, because this is the place for you! 

I come here every Saturday after work, and the service is always fast. They give you a wooden letter when you order, and will bring your food to your table when it's ready. I usually order their Petit Quebec bagel sandwich (under $7 and served with a side of chips) and a latte. 

They use fresh St. Viateur bagels, which is absolutely wonderful. From what I could tell, their sandwich toppings are fresh as well (tomatos, lettuce etc).

Worth a visit if you're feeling like a bagel without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant coffee shop, great for breakfast or light lunch. 
The service was very good; they took a tad longer than usual to serve the cortado we ordered, so they offered us a free baked good (we picked a chocolatine). The bagels were quite cheap and they were generous on the cream cheese. And it's not just any bagel - it's St-Viateur! 

I hesitated on their bagel sandwiches because I wasn't sure if the portion size would be worth it, but after looking at pictures online I decided I'll try one next time!"}
{"text":"I decided to eat here for lunch one day as it is relatively close to where I worked. I was introduced to this place when they decided to open up a location in the Place Ville Marie and Eaton Centre tunnel and were giving away free bagel sandwiches with a suggested/recommended tip. I liked the bagel sandwich and decided to drop by at this location.

I ordered one of their bagel sandwich combos which in my case included some potatoes, a bagel sandwich, salad, and a coffee.

Where I work, we get free coffee and I'm not a big coffee drinker but will have coffee only when I need a pick me up. I found the coffee to be okay. The bagel sandwich was very good. I thought that the potatoes were good as well. I'm not really a fan of salad and I didn't mind the salad.

There was free WiFi here. The table that I sat in was a bit lopsided. Nice small and quiet place that also accepts credit cards. Staff were also very friendly.

It is connected to Montreal's underground city if you know which tunnels/passageways to take in order to get here which is a plus for me since I work in a building connected to the underground city and don't need to go outside to get to this place in the event of bad weather."}
{"text":"The bagel sandwiches are so good! The bacon was enough and so crispy, the bagel itself is light and has great flavor from the sesame seeds on both buns. The Morrocan mint hot tea topped off my breakfast perfect for the winter morning."}
{"text":"My first stop of the day while I was downtown for a week for training. Fresh delicious bagels are to be found here! A sesame bagel with butter and melted Swiss cheese for $3 is a solid deal, at least to me!

Delicious and keep the hunger away until lunch.

Service is quick and my food always prepped within 5 minutes.

My only annoyance would be the alarm beeping every 5 seconds while picking up my food. If I was sitting down to eat/drink/stuff is have more cause to complain."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, but the chips that came with the bagel was the only good part of the meal"}
{"text":"This on is a little tricky to rate since it is a solid 3.5 but I am in a good mood today so I will give it a 4:)
When this location just opened the gave 2$ lattes (now its 3/4/4.75) which got me hooked. A good coffee place with reasonably priced bagels next to the University is a great idea. The coffee is a little too corase for me but still very tasty, the begales ate awasome and there is a 5$ bagel of the day deal. I hope this place will do better than the coffee shop that used to be in the same location."}
{"text":"Pleasant little cafe just a minute walk from McGill Metro. The veggie bagel sandwich was a delight as was the nutella bagel. They also bring out individual tea pots when you order tea! Definitely will be returning for study days!"}
