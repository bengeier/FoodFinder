{"text":"Nice place   Friendly service and great selection of wine.  A nice refuge in a busy airport.   The cheese selection was varied  and the burger delicious"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast while waiting for my flight. Chose the traditional breakfast.  Oh geez.  Danny's would have been a better choice.  The bacon tasted like it was five or six hours old and the potatoes were soggy and  very greasy.   Service was okay but certainly not four-star."}
{"text":"Great pork sliders! Best tasting margaritas that I had to have 2! The bartender Jeffery makes great drinks and is very helpful with choosing foods."}
{"text":"Looking for a good place to eat the airport since I have several hours before my plane plane leaves.  We decided to try this place because they had my partner's favorite beer and it \"looked\" good.  The bar was moderately busy and there was one guy behind the bar.  When he walked up we said \"how are you doing?\"   He said \"busy\"  Ok so much for first impressions.  My job gets \"busy\" too.  We got our drinks and he never asked us if we wanted s menu (which we did) and never asked if we wanted another drink.  He seemed preoccupied with cleaning up after all the customers who were leaving (everyone left while we were there).  Was it something I said?  When he was done with that he came over and asked if we were ready to checkout.  We took it as a sign and checked out.  We went over to try Chelsea's...."}
{"text":"I hope you have a layover. You're going to need a big one. This place has average food, and a delivery time about the same as a PHX to LAX flight.  I'm sure it's because they're new, but their legacy restaurant in Phoenix was open for 10 years before moving to the airport."}
{"text":"Certainly not cheap, but the best airport bar/restaurant I have had the pleasure patronizing in a long time. The bartender/server, Jeffrey, was prompt, engaging, and professional. He was by himself and never missed a beat with each & every customer in the place.  The menu is brief, but IMHO, just perfect for that airport wait. My french dip sandwich was excellent. The beer was cold, but $9.75/pint. Rarely do you leave an airport bar with such satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Stuck at the airport, this restaurant made it much easier to cope. Yummy Irish coffee. Fresh food, made to order.  Thanks John"}
{"text":"Had a 3 hour layover when the flight was cancelled. Jeffrey, the bartender, made the experience very comfortable. Suggested the Fillet and Blue Salad which was fabulous. Wine suggestions were right on. Definitely my go-to restaurant when flying through Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"This could be a very bad start. 6 customers, 6 employees and 60 minutes to get your food. Good news is that we were eating AFTER arrival, if not...time to re-book that flight. SUPER SLOW!"}
{"text":"Well...   First I want to say that I have experienced Cheuvront in downtown Phoenix many times and was a huge fan.  I loved the restaurant and everything about it.  The food was delicious, the wine list was amazing and the cheese selection was out of this world.   Not to mention the employees, who were knowledgeable and friendly on 100% of my visits.     Then, inexplicably, they decided to close the downtown location in favor it seems of this Sky Harbor location.  So they closed a real restaurant to later open in the airport as what I would now call a shadow of it's former self.    I am in Sky Harbor pretty frequently, as I travel relatively heavily for business purposes.   I had been awaiting the opening of Cheuvrant there for months.   Recently, three of us finally had the chance to stop there for some pre-departure adult beverages.  We also decided to eat.    What we found was that the menu was extremely limited, and although our prime rib sliders were quite good, the empanadas were not (they felt and tasted like they had been frozen previously) with hard and questionable pieces of what appeared to be meat inside them, and the cheese board was considerably overpriced for 3 small pieces of cheese, even by airport standards.   Overall, not pleased with the food.    The wine menu also disappointed.   There's a great bottle menu, but this is an airport!  How often are you going to sit down and have an entire bottle of $70 wine immediately before an encounter with the TSA?  I venture to say not very.   The by-the-glass menu was extremely limited and, in my mind, especially for a restaurant formerly known as \"Cheuvront Restaurant & Wine Bar\", completely inadequate.    In contrast to some of the other reviews, though, the service was prompt, food and beverage delivered quickly, and the bartender (we sat at the bar) was indeed knowledgeable and friendly.   This was really the only highlight of the visit.   As a former lover of the old Cheuvront, I was really, really disappointed, and will probably not go back to this location, especially since there is a Chelsea's Kitchen almost directly across the concourse.    Sorry Cheuvront, I really hate to be giving you a review this bad.  I was a huge fan of the downtown location and wish it had never closed.   If you ever open up another spot somewhere other than the airport, I'll give it a try, because I loved you that much before the airport......"}
{"text":"Service was slow and by the glass wine selection is lacking. Hopefully it improves with time."}
{"text":"If your flying out don't stop here. They have no regard for your time. After 20 minutes of waiting we checked on our order. Oh it'll be 15 minute more at least. The cook hasn't started it!  No apology from the below average (skill wise) server.  There were only 2 of us, she forgot 1 drink order and came back to ask what the 2nd food item was!  She should try writing orders down."}
{"text":"Sorry, call me a fool but I do not agree with past reviews! 10 minutes to get my tenderloin sliders with special order attached (horseradish rocks!) prompt service on my drinks, awesome service attitude. Pricing? C'mon, really? If you complain about pricing at an airport restaurant then ya need to stop and grab a bite before you get to the airport!"}
