{"text":"This is a proper student hang-out. But, even though my student days are sadly far behind me, I still love this place. It's great in the winter as it's all cosy and I like sitting by the bar people-watching, drinking a pint and eating their apple pie with ice-cream. Yumm.  In the summer, the patio gets really busy - so it does take a while to bag a table. And it can take a while to get served. But hey, I'm in no rush. I haven't tried anything else on the food menu, so can't comment on this."}
{"text":"Victory Cafe is not really a pub, but not really a cafe either. Its a once-house-turned-restaurant which gives it a nice cozy feel. I kind of had the feeling I was over at a friends place for dinner - relaxed atmosphere, tasty (& somewhat local) beer, great conversation and amazing comfort food. The mac and cheese, nachos, and grilled cheese were all great. I'd also recommend sitting either outside or upstairs if you can.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the creme brulee that I had. Who puts (possible canned) whipped cream on top of creme brulee?! Disappointing.

Best to stick to just the drinks at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday evening and it was already fairly crowded downstairs by 6 or 6:30 so my husband and I sat at the bar - had really great service by he bartender Jarvis, tried a flight of beer and ordered nachos (huge!) and poutine (my first time trying and it was delicious here). I had read good things about this place and the neighborhood and it did not disappoint. 

Great place to try in Toronto for some local fare."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a late dinner. We sat ourselves inside at the direction of the hostess, and it took a solid 25 minutes for anyone to even approach our table, and another 10 to order. And another 30 for the food to actually come out. I ordered the vegetarian curry with rice, at the recommendation of our server. Sigh, I should have known so much better than to trust someone who looks like she doesn't eat. It wasn't that bad, thus, the two stars, but it wasn't that good either due to the disgusting strawberry jam they smeared across the top of the dish was actually sickening (don't argue with me and tell me it was \"mango chutney\"--I know what mangos taste like!) 

It was really loud inside. I get it, it's a pub, great. But just be prepared not to be able to hear your friends sitting across from you because the people on either side of you are actually screaming. It is unlikely I'll be back--the last thing I need is a plate of macaroni and cheese (which, by the way, every single woman in the place was eating and I thought to myself, \"I'll bet that is the best thing on the menu...\")

So if you're in the mood for a beer, macaroni and cheese, and you want to pay 20 bucks for all of that instead of just making it at home, fill your boots!"}
{"text":"Ive never really been a huge fan of this place based on its dive bar status and the fact that it looks like its falling apart.  Decent selection of microbrew beer, pretty good food, but not so nice staff.  

Went in with a group for late night drinks and our server Gus actually had the audacity to come up to us after we had finished and tell us that he thought that the tip we left him was \"kinda shitty.\"  I'm sorry but you don't break the golden rule of serving by complaining about your tip especially when it comes as a direct reflection of your piss poor hipster attitude and lack of friendly service at our table. Treat your patrons like crap and you'll get the same in return. I've never been so insulted in my life and I will never go back to this sub par glory hole in the wall.  Save your money and go to Pour Boy."}
{"text":"Great location, but bad experience with staff and food. I don't mind if they're high, as long as they're functioning high. Also, last time I got food I wasn't stoked with the selection and got perogies. They were from frozen and not cooked all the way through. That was what I live on in uni. Never messed that up myself. Not impressed they did. 
Not all bad though. Great building and location, and decent beers."}
{"text":"Visited the Victory Cafe last night after work and I have to say that this really is one of my favourite patios in the city.  The patio wraps around one of the old houses on Markham Street, just south of Bloor, in the same strip as Southern Accent and the Beguiling Comic Book Store.  The service is a bit spotty, and the food is basically decent/cheap pub stuff.  We had fries with some sort of dill mayo dip that were amazing and two pitchers of beer.  The bill was about $40 including tip."}
{"text":"Umm I don't think I'll ever be going back after the what I ate. I've been to victory quite a bit never quite impressed with the food or prepackaged guacamole (it's really easy to make your own), then this happened:

Whatever you do, if your like depends on it do not get the Tacos with three dipping sauces. It was the most vile thing I have ever eaten. I never send food back but I really almost did yesterday cause I felt so ripped off and was so annoyed they could even call that a taco or edible. Give me any terrible tex mex concoction and it'll be fine.

The menu says it has tomato, it doesn't. It is your choice of meat, tasteless meat, no seasoning with more tasteless few strips of pepper and onion and lettuce. That's it, and no cheese. The corn tortilla could have been made from my shoe leather, I never thought I would taste anything like it.  We were both starving and in a rush and after one bite I wanted to leave it but we kinda just got through it cause of that. I hadn't eaten all day and it was not almost 10 pm.

The sauces, god help you, is a weird tasting ketchup concoction, some chipotle mayo and dill sauce exactly like the Gem's."}
{"text":"Estuve ahí unas 3 horas. Se puede conversar sin problemas, los platos y bebidas fueron normales, el servicio fue bueno. El lugar es agradable y muy popular. Vale la pena ir."}
{"text":"I go to the Victory Café fairly often. I'd say once every two weeks or so. I generally go after work as it is close to work and it's central enough for everyone. 

When I go, I generally sit downstairs in the booths, but I have sat upstairs as well. Last week, I sat out on the patio which was very nice. 

They've got a nice selection of local beers which changes from time to time. I like to try to try all of them but I never remember which ones I like! 

As for food, I've had the grilled cheese sandwich and the chicken club sandwich both of which were delicious. Although, I love sandwiches, and by the time I get there after work, I'm usually starving so everything seems delicious to me. In any case, the sandwiches run about $9-11 if I remember correctly.

The service is generally pretty good. I had one experience where the lady serving us got a bit snippy (when we ordered a second bottle of wine, she rolled her eyes and said \"you get charged for that\"... ummmmm of course we do?) but overall everyone is really nice and informative. Sometimes, I find it's hard to get anyone's attention for another round or to get the bill, but it's usually pretty busy and I'm not really ever in a rush so it's not a big deal. 

Overall, I must really like it there because I always end up back there!"}
{"text":"Victory is a fantastic go-to place for beer on the west side.  They usually have a couple of local casks on hand-pumps and a plethora of good draught on tap.  I've always found a beer to match my tastes.

Space is tight so don't expect to seat a large group. I like to go early to pre-drink and eat, but the place fills up quickly after dinner.  If you can get on the patio, it's a great place to hang out with friends.

The Victory has a bar atmosphere, but don't let that fool you, the menu is superb and it's well worth going for a dinner with a couple of people.  The grilled cheese is really good, the yam frites are crisp and delicious and the nachos are prodigious.

You can't lose by going to the Victory!"}
{"text":"It's really not that hard to make a hamburger.
A good amount of meat, don't overcook it, and top with fresh ingredients.
Unfortunately none of these things occurred in the making of the burger I just ate here. 
The service staff was, as usual, helpful and friendly, but that awful burger with the tiniest serving of a side (which was room temp and had dried-out bits that had been exposed to air and uncovered for some time) was a really unpleasant surprise. 
Drinks only from now on I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome patio. Decent micro-brew selection. Friendly and attentive staff. Better than average pub fare. Good spot."}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed to death, but I agree with most comments - it's a cool spot for beers and okay pub food. 

Quick summary:

1. FOOD - Lots of vegetarian options - especially for a pub. If you're sick of veggie burgers and food covered in cheese, try the curry. It's very flavourful, full of vegetables/chickpeas (not lentils - despite what the menu says). I know it goes against that 'When in Rome' logic, but whatever, I've had it twice, and it comes with mango chutney, so you can't go wrong. 

2. BEER - Excellent variety of beers on tap.I had the Denison's Weissbier - tasted just like Germany. 

3. SERVICE - Slow, but relaxing patio on quiet street makes it feel okay."}
{"text":"The beer selection and the food are OK. What really bother's me is the lack of care that their staff shows. They all look like they are stoned and couldn't care less about you. Or maybe they just need a break, who knows? Anyways, not worth going out of your way for the experience."}
{"text":"I use to enjoy the catfish that they had, but they took it off of the menu.
Recently, I ordered the veggie burger and it was okay; nothing really special about it.

The service is great and, suprisingly, prompt.  

This place is better for ordering a beer and meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"Simply put, my kind of place.

...open and serving food and drink until 2am

...cozy environment ( in a converted house) and good bar seating which is where I like to sit and eat and drink generally speaking

...attentive service

... small but focused bar menu, inexpensive

Side note 1: The soup special - a rustic borscht gave me a foodgasm

Side note 2: The grilled cheese wasn't bad, I just don't happen to like the super thick bread they served it on - it was a misorder for me, but depends on what ya like.

Side note 3: The bartender's name ( who was adorable and awesome) was Norm. And I just like that name - it's friendly!"}
{"text":"Great location, cozy place to hang out with friends, staff is friendly and helpful.
Beside good coffee they have a nice selection of craft beers.
Food took a bit of time to come but was worth the wait. Fun place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding BEvERage selection!  They're happy to provide samplers to help you explore your preferences.

My spouse and I have lived in the Annex for more than six years, but only in the early months of 2016 did we discover this place.  Whether with her or friends, I've been to Victory Cafe at least five times in three months.  We've also brought our infant son with us a few times and the staff have all been very helpful/accommodating.  No problems at all!

Now, I can't provide too much perspective on the food as I have ordered the same menu item all five times.  An outstanding sandwich... The Spotted Pig.  My spouse and friends have ordered different menu items and every time everyone has only had good things to say about the food.  So I'd say we're looking at some pretty good menu options there.  But truly, this place's best options are in the BEvERages.

I've also noticed people complain about their pricing.  I'm confused by this.  The average entree is priced in the $12-$14 range.  Comparing their sandwiches/burgers to, say, The Burger's Priest just down Bloor Street, Victory Cafe offers much better value for a dollar.  The average burger at The Burger's Priest is $10 and then $4 for fries.  That exceeds Victory Cafe's pricing.  Overall, I'd say Victory Cafe is quite reasonably priced!

I'm looking forward to the patio opening up this week... I imagine it'll be packed, but it's a beautiful corner spot in a FUN neighbourhood.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Victory is one of those places that suffers from its own popularity.  On summer evenings, even small groups can wait an interminable length of time for a patio spot, and the rest of the year the same is true for the inside of the bar.  I still like it quite a bit and wonder if I'm due for a return visit soon.

For eats, I would recommend the grilled cheese (with or without bacon!), the club sandwich and the nachos.  I have yet to try the mac and cheese, as my friends who have gone here for years lament the fact that it used to be delicious and it hasn't been the same for some time.  In the face of such ambivalence I am usually forced to just order a club instead.

Oddly enough, for such a fan of poutine, I have yet to try the poutine at the Vic.  I'm sure I will get to it eventually but I am told by some that it is some of the best poutine in town.  It's also a great place to take vegetarian friends as a large chunk of their menu is devoted to tasty veggie eats."}
{"text":"I end up at Victory Cafe because it's on my way home from work, their music is good, and they have a great selection of beer.  Oh, and it feels like a pub -- probably because it kind of is.  

Normally quite packed with a good selection of non-pretentious folks, they have a downstairs area with two rooms and a larger upstairs area.  Their cask beer is only served downstairs but you can trek down and trek back up with it if your party is upstairs.  In the summer though, they've got a wonderful patio that faces the street so you can hang out, people watch, and drink beer on the most beautiful of summer days and evenings on Markham street.  I can't wait for summer!

Their food is only fair to middling: not the best, not the worst.  I normally don't go for the food but if I must eat it I will.  They have the usual burgers, salads, fries, vegetable curry, and so on."}
{"text":"Victory is great. A comfortable, down-to-earth pub that makes the city feel a bit less like a big shiny metropolis to me (that's good). Lots of yummy local beers, good food, and a big patio that is one of my very favourite places to relax as a summer afternoon melts into evening. It's often so busy that it's hard to find a seat, but I suppose I can't really expect to be the only one who think this place is great. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"A perfect pub. Nothing too fancy but excellent beer on tap (try the Weissbier) and tasty pub grub. I enjoy the atmosphere there, not too studend-ty, not too annex-y, not too yorkville-y. I like to go there with friends and I had good success on first dates there. It's loud enough to converse yet not too quiet. I like to refer to it as my neighborhood bar, although I live in Parkdale.."}
{"text":"Great staff, great beer. Not so great food. I had the surf and turf tacos. Tortillas were definitely not fresh, steak was really tough. I would definitely come back for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"Great patio. Slow service for ordering food & drinks but food arrives quickly. I have never found the servers to be good and you'll never see them smile. There is also a big deal made about splitting bills. Food is hit & miss, sometimes good, sometimes bad. Order the salads with dressing on the side - they put far too much on and it's not that nice!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor Café, the Steak and Eggs are delicious.  The home fries are nice , the steak is \"succulent\"..  Nice meal any time of day.   It's a nice touch that they have both a smoking and non-smoking patio."}
{"text":"I love this place. The wide selection of beer on tap is pretty awesome. This place has quickly and easily become my local hangout and the staff here are all friendly (and have amazing facial hair!).

There are two levels which means enough seating for everyone. Also, it's located in a great part of the city, right off Bloor in the heart of the Annex. 

I have already brought a few friends here and will continue to spread the word about this place. I've only ever come here for drinks but this place has pretty great reviews for their food, too."}
{"text":"The Victory has possibly one of the best summer patios in Toronto for lounging with some friends. Just off the beaten path Victory provides tree-lined relief and an excellent supply of beer that includes many micro-breweries. The burger here is great along with their version of mac and cheese. The bar area is tight so sitting more than groups of 4 is tough and expect it to be full on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I've never actually had a meal here before, but it's one of my favourite spots to grab a drink. 

On the first visit, I came through with a couple of friends and enjoyed a pitcher of sangria on the patio. The second time around, we grabbed a table upstairs. It's a little tight and kind of dark upstairs, especially at night. But otherwise, a pretty cool spot! I guess it's more of a sentimental pick, but hey! I like it.

Never had any issues with service or anything. They're quite friendly here!

Bonus points for having my favourite beer, Spearhead Hawaiian Pale Ale, available!"}
{"text":"Good location and an amazing patio. I like the interior too. The beer selection is pretty good as well. What ruins this place for me is the staff. The services is slow and most of the staff I have met seem to be indifferent hipster types who act like they just don't want to be there."}
{"text":"One of my fave patios and pubs in Toronto. Good micro brews and yummy home cooked style food. Best veggie chili I've had in the city. And great prices for the amount of food you get. Beer is average price. 
And I love that it's in my neighbourhood (the annex), but off Bloor so it's a little more cozy and has better atmosphere than a lot of places in the area. Markham is a really cute tree lined street and sitting on the Victory patio is relaxing.

Only issue is the service can be hit or miss - they're never rude but depending on how packed the patio is you might not see your server for awhile but I go to the Victory to hang out, not to rush in and out so I don't mind.

If you're trying to hit the patio on a really nice evening be prepared to wait. But you can drink while you wait at least :)"}
{"text":"you can find specials on their website (drinks and food)

table of four, we sat ourselves upstairs. it was candlelit with dim lights (the servers turned up the lights about 1/2 hour later)

owner came to take our drink orders and then food orders - he clearly knew the menu (didn't have to write anything down) and was friendly.

items that were consumed: 
Weissbeer (Bavarian beer)
pulled pork sandwich, substituting fries with mac and cheese
Mac and Cheese + caesar salad
fish and chips (two pieces of fish)

To be honest, out of all the food we had ordered, the mac and cheese was the best.  Pulled pork sandwich was dripping with sauce but it was bland. 
The fish with the fish and chips were dry. 
If you do order a sandwich, I highly suggest you substitute fries with mac and cheese (it's only $3-4 more and you get a portion that is just enough for you to enjoy mac and cheese (and not be stuffed / overwhelmed)).  The entree sized mac and cheese is pretty big, so you could probably share it with someone else .

We didn't order the nachos, but it looked really good (many other tables ordered that, so we saw servers walking by with nachos throughout the meal).  I think anything cheese related on the menu is a safer bet, so keep that in mind if you go. I do recommend going to try out the place anyways - doesn't have to be for food, they stock beer that is different from what you'd find in restaurants and it's a nice environment to just hang out and chat."}
{"text":"C'est bon, ça tient la route. Avec un portrait de Churchill est un décor on ne peut plus basique, le Victory Café est le Pub de quartier pour universitaires n'ayant décroché de bourse."}
{"text":"All of their servers here are very pleasant and really, really knowledgeable about beer. seriously, every time I come here I learn something new and that is totally great. But when you go to an old place expecting to have a small-talk type conversation with familiar face about everything and anything going on in beer-land and see a bunch different faces instead, kinda irks me a bit. Consistency is not only awesome, but it makes a customer feel more welcome and at home. Not to mention the bartender I had the other night who couldn't tell me more about what was on cask besides the name of the batch and brewer, really? You're a bartender and you cant tell me how whatever you have on cask compares to, oh, say.. anything you have on tap? Isn't that your job? Or do you just not care? Also, what's up with the creepy/sketchy men hanging out at the bar almost every time I am in there, presumably making various kinds of deals with each other and ogling anything with breasts? Way to set an atmosphere.... And, I would way rather NOT watch crappy cp24 when I'm trying to unwind after work, just sayin'.

Other then that, their taps are decent. Their service is most-excellent, and their food isn't too bad either, albeit a bit pricey for general pub fare. It's probably better to hang out here on a quiet weeknight as it gets pretty packed on weekends.

2 stars for the servers beer and food, no stars for the old men, stuck-up bartender and all around shitty atmosphere that those two things create."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I looked at the cute patio and said to myself, \"Love this. Want to come back a lot\". 

Sure, I found things to like about it. There's nice seating outside, nice seating inside, great drink selection (Kwartha Lakes Raspberry Wheat!), an inventive menu for a pub, not feeling rushed, good pricing, packed but not crowded tables. 

But I can't go the full mile and say I loved it wholly. For starters, food. I like greasy food. But when a pool of oil grows and grows at the bottom of my plate of mac and cheese I get a bit turned off. Also, whatever that salty sprinkle garnish was- no go. The samosas were good, but came with a mango \"chutney\"/puree that was too sweet for what the samosas were packing. 

Onto the waiter. Sitting at a table in the back, my friend and I didn't have menus yet. He came over and asked what we wanted. We were a little puzzled, no menus and all, so he said \"did no one explain to you how this works?\"  Sorry, I didn't realize most places had a designated person to explain such complex things like -gasp- ordering. Where is this mystical person? Or maybe the waiter could've just given me the menu without the 'tude?

This experience could be a one-off with this guy who seemed a bit neurotic. A neurotic guy who forgets drinks and doesn't give you water with your meal unless you ask. But I would come back. I want to give this place another shot. My gut wants to like it."}
{"text":"This place, which I always thought was adequate, is reopening in the near future. Most likely they will be back in business by October, 2017. They are relocating to 440 Bloor Street West and will be rebranding as \" Victory Cafe 2.0\".

Hopefully the new place will also have an improved menu and more experienced servers."}
{"text":"Great spot for students on a budget, or adults who like good food and cheap pints! Nachos, amazing. Beer, yup. Grilled cheese and french fries, poutine, veggie burgers, Mmmmmm. Not to mention the leafy corner patio in the summer, the cozy atmosphere and relaxed vibe. Downside is that it gets busy, especially downstairs."}
{"text":"A very solid place. If you want to do bars right, you can't go wrong here. Food is on the upper-end too. Only complaint is some of the service. Many are nice, but during patio season the people who take your name waiting for a table are usually pretty abrupt with you. 

Sometimes it feels like you're waiting for a pass into hipsterdom. Other than that, great place."}
{"text":"I'll add to the slew of reviews - this is a great place to grab good comfort food and cheap beer. They have a not-too-extensive draught list, but the 8 or so they do have are delicious and different. They also allow you to sample one before ordering! No ciders on tap

The service is great, really attentive even on a busy Friday night. Speaking of which, make sure you go early and stake out a spot, this place is bumpin' in the evenings. It has a great vibe, good music, lots of people, and close to Bloor & Bathurst. It's not huge, but there is an upstairs and downstairs, both with a bar and tables and such.

They have burgers, mac & cheese, poutine, etc. All my unhealthy but oh-so-delicious faves. The prices are really reasonable as well. All in all, a great place for a much needed Friday drink!"}
{"text":"Went to the vic on a sunday afternoon for lunch with my girlfriend.  Sat on the awesome patio and had a couple of beers and food. 

- food was great we had the veg curry, the grilled cheese, and the calamari.  All of which were perfectly done and tasted great, and of good sized portions.  

- servers were very slow to get to our table (15mins), She also brought out our appetizer after we had fininshed our mains..... so that was kinda strange.  That said she was very friendly and clearly very busy.  

- patio was awesome.  

-ambiance was good... except for three loud douchey 40 yr old guys sitting next to us that kept talking about how awesome they were and mildly harassing the waitress.  

All in all a good experience and will be going back."}
{"text":"Your typical place to grab a beer and relax with people on a pretty nice patio. Patio is nicely located in a tiny block of restaurants/pubs at the edge of nice residential area. The food is your typical bar fare and I have not had anything to complain about. Overall: you won't be disappointed to come here with friends for beers and some pub food on a beautiful summer afternoon."}
{"text":"The staff at Victory Cafe are really great, and accommodating. I love getting some beers on the patio coupled with some Macaroni and Cheese, which I loved!! 

Would definitely come back, it's a great patio for relaxing after work or a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is terrible. We were sitting on the patio and eventually moved inside but all the servers are a disaster - can't get anyone's attention to order, a forgotten meal, wrong beers served, unfamiliarity with the menu, and just snotty attitude in general. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, i lived on Euclid so this was my go-to place for a pint. Oh how I missed the patio at this place in the summer time! 
I revisited this place last evening and ate (or rather devoured) the grilled cheese & fries. I've had their food before and thought \"meh, it's regular pub fare quality\" but wowza! my friend who also ordered the same meal, we were still raving about it this morning. hell, i was thinking about it while riding my bike to work \"That was one damn good grilled cheese sandwich and oh those fries & garlicky sauce!!\"
The dipping sauce, oh my!! If it wasn't so socially unacceptable, I would've licked that little paper cup that held the dipping sauce clean.
The grilled cheese wasn't your average Kraft slices slapped on to white bread kind of sandwich. Strings of gruyere and cheddar were oozing between the sandwich and my mouth (would not recommend this if you're on a hot date). There were pieces of fresh basil and sundried tomatoes smothered between a very crispy calabrese bread.  I loved the crispy fries with their potato skins still on one side and i think i've drooled/said enough about the dipping sauce.
my friend and i are going to come back here and get the mac n' cheese with caesar salad and garlic bread and then go breathe on all those people we love. i can't wait!"}
{"text":"Short but diverse menu. Definitely can tell that the chefs care about what they place infront of you from the quality and taste of the food...can't wait to be back to chill on the patio and try other dishes.... Although I'm not crazy about one of the servers who was slightly rude-ish but his coworker  was the exact opposite and very friendly..so I'm not going to hold it against the place just yet"}
{"text":"It pains me to write a rather poor review given that there are so many glowing reviews. I had read the nachos here were incredible, but I have to disagree. Yes, the portion size was absolutely massive, however the cheese wasn't melted and really, the quality of the cheese itself was lacking. When our under cooked nachos arrived, we didn't receive our water we previously requested. No one came back for a solid 10-15 mins, while we waited parched. (we were on the patio) We were waiting and waiting for the bill, and finally decided to go inside to obtain it ourselves. It is a cute place, and I would like to give it another chance, since most others had a much better experience. Rating: 2.5."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here! Very chill and comfortable, and on a nice, warm, night its amazing to sit on their patio facing the neighbourhood. Duely note that one of the patios closes at a different time due to it being \"more in the residential area\". Its a great spot for a pint with friends, and having some quality bar grub. All the waitors are really chill and conversational. Overall its a great go to spot in the annex. I love how it feels hidden and tucked away, makes it feel like a speak easy-ish."}
{"text":"My one star review is based on my experience with reservations.

I picked this place because the reviews indicated it was great for accommodating large groups. I called to make a reservation for 10 on the patio and was told it would probably rain on the day I requested, which was weird enough because I had seen a clear forecast.

I was assured by the person on the phone that we would be moved outside on the patio, if it didn't rain.

I arrived to be told they NEVER take reservations on the patio. This place needs to get their story straight. 

Luckily we moved next door to the Butler's pantry which was lovely and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Go for the beer, definitely not for the food!  Love the quirky selection of beers, but the wings were barely edible - dry with a hint of freezer burn.  The atmosphere is great for small groups and I'd love to try the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Many places are defined by their patios. Victory Cafe is one of those... for most of the Summer, that is. It is a well known venue for some art nights and their colour selection of beers on tap... although not too many. No one is going to confuse this place with Volo or much less the Bier Market.

During the winter this is a great place, specially the second floor, with a large room to mingle and a fireplace.

However, due to the large landing strip of a patio, it will be of no surprise that during sunny days there will be a line up of people and yes, most likely to use the patio or better said: To avoid the Dante's Inferno roasting people alive inside the main building. 

For real, it is painfully hot. 

I recently hosted a Spanish language event and we were originally set to be in the small room to the left of the entrance on the main floor, otherwise known as Le Oven. Only minutes after arriving I requested for my group to be moved to the main room, yes it was also hot but at least it had one (1) window. 

Remember the old saying, \"In a world full of rooms with no windows, the one room that has one, is the one where no one suffocates in.\"    

So we endured, having fun and drinking and being merry. All in all, it was a lot of fun, I ended up being there for 6 hours and still left people there to carry the torch until they finished their food and drink or until they spontaneously combusted, whichever happened first.

The food was alright, the prices are decent but during the summer, if you want to go a patio, come here. If you can't get into the patio, go elsewhere. Hopefully with some AC."}
{"text":"I really like this place - it's definitely a great student hangout. The prices are great, and it can really get hopping on the weekends; great vibe. The grilled cheese sandwich is probably one of the best I've ever had, and their fries are gorgeous. The beer selection is awesome, and the seating arrangements are really neat - this place is made for small groups (2-4 people). I had a birthday party here and reserved the side room, which worked really well for 15 people.

Only bad sides - it can get really hot and stifling (esp. in the summer) and the service can get really bad. For the party I mentioned it was decent because we had a server assigned to us, but they refused to let people pay individually, which was a hassle. Normally, it can take ages to get a server to give you drinks, and the bar(s) can get totally packed. Further, if you're sitting at a table and you try to speed things up by going to the bar, they might even refuse to serve you, to 'preserve the server's tab'.

Also - they have a fantastic beer menu, but that's it. Ordering wine or spirits (except for wells drinks) is a waste. Prices for wells are great, though.

To sum up- if you're relaxed and easygoing, this is a fantastic place. If you need good service to have a good time, I would suggest somewhere else. But this place is so good, you may want to make yourself easygoing ..."}
{"text":"Whomp, whomp. I hadn't been to Victory Cafe in a very long time...probably about a year or so. When we first got there, there were so few people we thought it might be closed. Looking back, this was probably a warning sign.

I loved their mac n cheese so I ordered it tonight for dinner. SO DISAPPOINTING. There was hardly any cheese, it wasn't the same as before. I was so saddened by this turn of events. I also ordered a Coke and the waiter didn't know if it was Coca Cola, Pepsi or something generic. It was watery and terrible. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Did you know they serve curry chicken? And did you know it's fantastic???
I'm 100% against eating curry in public.  And I am 100% against eating curry in a pub.  I find curry unattractive in every sense.  But on an irregular strange day I devoured a plate of the most delicious on-the-bone curry chicken right HERE

And THEN I followed it up with their creme brulee which I was very impressed with considering it was a pub.

The bar is HUGE with two floors and two \"wings\" on each floor.  I've never tried sitting upstairs- I thoroughly enjoy sitting at the downstairs bar.  the staff are friendly- the beer is plentiful- and they have a killer stout on tap."}
{"text":"Victory Cafe had been a staple to my weekend afternoon routine for years....

 During the summer, I'd sit outside and watch families and dog walkers and take in the din. During the winter, I'd get a cozy seat in a booth and admire the art on display. I got to know the servers, got to explore the different rooms (there is seating to the right and left of the entrance) and fell in love with the stuffed French-toast for brunch.

 Nearly every weekend for the longest time, I'd go and order it and it was phenomenal each time. I'd bring friends and guests from out of town and wow them with Victory's delicious food and cozy, at-home atmosphere.

   And then....one fateful day....I discovered that this wonderful place that had become much more than a bite to eat to me, had stopped, to my dismay, serving brunch. To update everyone: Victory Cafe is still a great place to go and eat lunch and dinner and to listen to some good local bands in the evening...but, the brunch that once was; is no more, and it saddens me that I will never again get to eat it. 

It will forever remain a wonderful memory, but I tell everyone who may not know, as I didn't, (and was shocked when I found out) Victory Cafe no longer serves their delicious brunch menu. Let's all take a moment of silence...."}
{"text":"I hate to downgrade the Victory, but every time  I go there the food gets worse and the portions get smaller.  I don't know if it's because I went there on busy nights, but the quality definitely went way down.  The salad just became totally slathered with dressing.  

I'm not gonna write this place off, but hopefully it gets on an upswing again."}
{"text":"Great spot in the annex to go enjoy some drinks! They have some pretty good food, mostly bar stuff. Nachos are yum. Inside is very cute an intimate. I love the two person booths along the wall on the second floor! The patio is my spot though so long as the weather is good :)"}
{"text":"A really great patio, great service, neat selection on draft and tasty smelling food.

I came here to hang out with some fellow yelpers and stare at them as they ate dinner. 

It took a while to get seated, as they don't take reservations for the patio and it was super busy. Service was pretty quick, considering the place was packed. The food all looked and smelled amazing. I'll definitely have to try the food here next time.

Their white sangria was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try their food next time."}
{"text":"I went here before the holidays for a birthday gathering.  The pub is super cute inside an old house so it's a cozy atmosphere for the cold winter months!  It was really busy as it was a Saturday night but the wait staff were available. It got quite noisy to the point you couldn't really chat at a comfortable level at times.    

I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and also sampled my friend's poutine.  They have a decent selection of beers.  I would definitely come back here again :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, went in for brunch the Benedict eggs are amazing! The patio has a very good ambiance without the rush of traffic and people that you usually get from sitting in a patio on queen, king, etc."}
{"text":"If you want to check out a place off the beaten path in Toronto this is worth the visit. They have a good beer selection and an awesome menu. My friend and I both had the lentil soup and the mac & cheese entree which I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been coming here regularly over the years because it is a very comfortable place to go for a quality Ontario microbrewery beer. I love sitting at the bar downstairs and find the staff to be friendly, prompt and the music is great. 

I would not recommend weekends if you are looking for a quiet night out though because the place fills up quite quickly and it can be nearly impossible to find a  seat. 

I recommend the wings ordered hot and when they say hot, it means hot!! The mac and cheese is what they are renowned for and for good reason. I also recommend the poutine. 

Try a cask ale which changes weekly. It is non carbonated and different than any other beers I have tried. THe Hop Addict is another hoppy and delicious brew."}
{"text":"It's an okay spot away from Bloor street and the patio is nice but always crowded in the summer.  Servers range from granola grumpy to hipster scruffy. Kind of seems like the service never comes together the way it should. Either the food isn't available, or you can't order just yet or the waitress ignores you. The mac and cheese is really good but even though I can see this place literally from my house I can't ever be bothered to go in anymore."}
{"text":"Meh. A little overrated. I expected a lot more from this little pub 

Although I really liked the beer selection from local  microbreweries but would be nice if there was description about each one. 

We waited almost half an hour for a table on the patio. And when it got dark, there were no candles or outdoor lighting. It was dark. 

The place seems nice for a drink, rather than dinner. Yes it probably has one of the better selection of bar food but it's still bar food. 

I don't know what's do great about the mac and cheese and why everyone was raving about it. It's good but not that good and there was  really a pool of grease on the bottom.  I felt like there was no taste and I added ketchup. I never like adding ketchup to my mac and cheese. 
It came with the salad but barely any dressing on it. I was eating dry leaves.   

The salmon crab cakes were Delish

The servers were okay and always seemed to try to carry more than they can handle as if to spare an extra trip.
Our server didn't seem to be all there and was soft spoken at first. 

+2 for beers. +1 for food.
I'd come here again mainly for drinks"}
{"text":"I'll take a laid back bar with a nice patio for a night of drinking over a loud, overcrowded club any day and Victory Café certainly fits the bill. 

Located in a converted house, this is a cozy and laid back place to grab a drink. The beer menu is pretty solid and consists of a good variety of craft beer on tap and in bottles. I stuck to beer on my visit here so I cannot comment on the quality of mixed drinks. The price for beer was very reasonable with a pint averaging around $6-$7, definitely a great deal considering the location. I was here on a Saturday night and the place was buzzing, the patio was full and both bars were fairly steady. If you are in a big group I would suggest you go to the upstairs bar as it is much more spacious, downstairs is a bit tight with booth seating set up against the wall. 

The staff seemed pretty friendly, and the bartenders were pretty knowledgeable about their beer selection. I came here for drinks only so I cannot comment on the food, but judging from some plates I saw the food doesn't look particularly exciting. This is a great place to grab a pint, or six and just chill out with some friends, I will be back for a beer when I am in the area! 

*This place gets bonus points for being extremely close to the Bathurst subway station and for having a bathroom upstairs instead of the basement."}
{"text":"So the food is pretty good but overpriced. The thing that irks me is there was basically no alcohol in the Caesars I ordered. I am small, I had two, and I wasn't even tipsy. No taste of alcohol, no feel of it. Super lame. Also, no happy hour."}
{"text":"Plenty of potential: situated in a historic 3-story Victorian house with a large porch/patio in the heart of Mirvish village. The food is not high quality. Standard pub fare with little flare and poor nacho layering! Each layer must have cheese, please. 

The beer selection is great but the service is just OK. The bathrooms are not up to my cleanliness standard (i.e. i try not to touch anything) and the interior smells of sweaty gym/frat house. 

Its really too bad because the space and location are ideal and the crowd can be interesting at times but at the end of the day, its just a regular pub. Meh. 

Why you should come here: patio, beer, and convenience. 2.5 stars. Halfway there!"}
{"text":"Unique place with very nice services and great selection of beers. 

The prices are in the average with the neighbouring bars and pubs. 

The negative experience was the food. Great incredients combination in my Tacos Plate, but the chicken meat was grilled so much that it was hard to chew. My friend had a burger, and that was even worst. The bun was terrible and the meat in the burger was thin and super-overgrilled into perfect dryness.

Enjoy the chat with friends there while being served by friendly staff, but don't expect food delicacy."}
{"text":"This review is based on four month's worth of visits to Victory Cafe, more of an overarching impression I guess. 

I haven't ever sat indoors, so this is mostly about the patio- it's cozy, the staff is very attentive, and the added bonus is that markham and lennox is one of the cutest intersections in the area, so it's got a nice little view too. 

When I came here the first time, I was actually overwhelmed by how good the food options looked for a pub-style establishment. I've come here with both vegans and vegetarians, no one has really had a problem finding something to eat, and carnivorous though I am myself, I have opted for the vegetarian options myself here, simply because they just looked so good. I've tried a fair number of their offerings over the last few months, we usually order a few things and share. I have never had anything bad, but it does vary from meh to great.

Apps:
Sweet Potato Fries - Perfectly cooked, great chipotle mayo, and the serving is massive (shared it with with two others, there were still a few left when our final round of drinks came around, seemed like a bottomless pit of fries.)

Spinach and Cheese Quesadilla- messy but delicious. I ordered it as is, with no sour cream, guac, or chicken and it made a delicious, melty treat.

Spinach Dip - it's a little more watery than your average spinach dip, but the flavors are all there. I didn't love the bread they chose but again, the dip tastes good, it's really not a deal-breaker that the bred was just alright.

Victory Nachos - these were just okay. It's a very very generous helping, and they don't skip on any of the delicious toppings, but I've had this issue with most nacho plates in Toronto- they're not using the right cheese to melt between the nachos, but it's still a great sharing plate.

Salads:
Caesar Salad - The first time I ordered this it was flawless, one of the best caesar's i'd had in a long time. The second time it was VERY warm.. which really put me off of finishing it. I can't honestly tell you which circumstance was the fluke in this case, as I only ordered it twice.

Burgers:
Veggie Burger - Delicious. As I mentioned earlier, I'm a big meat-eater and I have been trying to get into more vegetarian food, and this was a great intro. the Cranberry Salsa was a good addition. It was a tad too sweet, but adding cheddar helped balance it out a little. Ordered it with a side of Mac n Cheese - it was so delicious it ruined my life. Eat the mac and Cheese, just do it.

Victory Burger - Cooked exactly how I asked, didn't even get cheese just ordered the burger straight and enjoyed the bejeesus out of it.

Sandwiches:
Pulled Pork - This was actually the first time I'd had pulled pork, and I made the mistake of ordering it as my main when we went here for a proper dinner once. It is definitely big enough for two people, and it is just delicious. They serve it with the slaw on the sandwich which is traditional i think, but I enjoyed the slaw on the side. all very delicious, ordered with fries which were perfect.

Victory Grilled Cheese - Ordered this bad boy with bacon, you won't regret it. It's very heavy, but it's nice to eat a half, have a beer, and maybe venture the rest of it.

Drinks:
The drink menu isn't very long, but it's unique and I love that. I don't want to go to the 1000th place in Toronto where I can get a Steamwhistle as my best option. They have some rotating taps (great lakes and...flying monkeys i think) and have some fun beer cocktails. I went for the Cider once (Thornbury.. or something? Can't remember it's from ontario). I've also had the Snake Bite (Stout&Cider) and the Hoptang (Gin, Grapefruit Juice, pale ale and honey). It's always been good.

Basically, I'm a huge fan. My only contention is it can take a long while to get a seat, but that's not really something they can help, they're just very popular."}
{"text":"we went to the victory cafe after my friend recommended it but unfortunately that had changed their menu that week. 

veggie options were limited and when I asked the waiter what the difference was between two different salads with beetroot and he didn't know anything about the salads.

if a restaurant updates its menu, the owners/chefs should educate the serving staff, have them taste the food, and know the menu! there is absolutely no excuse for not knowing your menu. 

my friend got the calamari which was an appetizer but fairly pricey, and included twelve small pieces of calamari with a large salad?? seemed very odd, it wasn't a garnish, it was a rather large salad with a small bit of calamari on the side. 


The beer selection was excellent and I would go back for a beer!"}
{"text":"This is the most popular spot in the Mirvish Village strip for the following reasons:

It's patio is one of those giant wrap around patios that fills up fast on nice summer nights.  The downside to this big patio is that it's not always fully open, and when it is fully open, it can be hard to be some reasonable service over in the deep end.  Even to sit inside can be a bit of a struggle (inevitably ending in letdown) because this place fills up fast.  Get there early (or rely on luck!) to ensure you have a table.

The selection of beers is both vast and totally unique.  Not Labatt Bland or whatever here.  These brews taste like something and even if you don't like the beer you try first, at least you're a better person for having tried something new.

The food is excellent.  Everything I've ever had there has been pleasing to the senses and the stomach, whether it be soup, sweet potato fries, a burger, breakfast or some fish.  Note: Their club house sandwich is not a club house sandwich.  However, it IS delicious."}
{"text":"Defoz one of my top 10 spots in the city. Patio is gorgeous, area is pretty and convenient, so close to anything you could possible want. Grilled cheese is delicious!!! Try their apricot beer (lager i think?) if you're into a bit of fruitiness, this will wash your sorrows or enhance your happiness guaranteed. 

The place itself is pretty big and the staff are friendly. On a warm day, it's practically impossible to get a table on the patio but its worth the try. Ask to wait and enjoy a whole afternoon in the company of greenery and good friends. I LOVE YOU VIC CAFE!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the great craft beer selection and good service.

Skip the Haddock Burger.  They don't show up on menus in Toronto often so I was excited try it at The Vic. As an aficionado of fish sandwiches, this was the most disappointing I've experienced.  I had to lift the standard sized bun to see if there was any fish underneath. It was the smallest piece I've seen in sandwich form.  As for taste - dull and over-fryed.  Adding insult to injury, the side garden salad I ordered was more or less the same arugula already on the sandwich, with only a hint of dressing.

Beer 9/10
Service 8/10
Food 5/10

Will be back for the brews, will eat elsewhere first."}
{"text":"The Victory Cafe is gigantic and cavernous. The bar consists of several rooms or varying sizes. For these reasons it seems to be a common choice for big meet ups. Toronto's Flickr Group often meet here. The bar has a pretty good selection of Ontario beer. You can usually find something interesting on tap. Food is reasonably good and reasonably cheap. In the summer they have a fairly big patio, which is also enjoyable."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of friends from work a little while ago.  We were worried about getting a spot for a large group so we went out pretty early (8:30pm - which is early to me).  We ended up staying there the entire night, and b/c of the size of this place, we could have easily come in late and gotten a spot.  A big plus in my books!  

We got a spot on the side patio.  We were all the way down at the end away from people so it was nice to kind of have our own spot to add chairs when more people came.  We moved inside afterward when it got cold, and surprisingly we had no problem grabbing a big table upstairs.  

I was happy with the service, and drinks were pretty cheap ($10 for a double vodka 7).  They had no problem splitting the bills either (and there was no automatic tip added for our large group which I was surprised - and happy - about).  

The menu looked decent.  I didn't order anything, but a couple friends did and the food looked pretty good.  Next time!"}
{"text":"NIce atmosphere, good food and good beer selection. I came with some of my classmates after class one night for dinner and drinks. I had the mac n cheese which was good and a few beers. I was impressed with their menu and beer selection. Pretty reasonably priced. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"a really fun spot for a beer just off the bloor strip, and better than all the other local options (unless you are looking for live music).  killer patio, eclectic events, good beer, and a fireplace!"}
{"text":"We recently had a large meetup at the Victory Cafe. Only a couple of people from our party had been here before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.

Upon approaching the cafe, which is located in a mostly residential neighbourhood, you'll notice their very attractive patio that wraps around the older building. Inside there is a bar and a few party rooms, both up and downstairs. 

This is a bit of an older building, but I adore the dive like feeling. And the place was actually clean, including the washrooms, which you can't say for a lot of venues in the city. Inside there are two HD televisions at the bar, and one in the party room on the ground floor. Our waiter had never actually turned on the party room television, but did manage to get it working for the Olympics. And although we didn't sit at the patio, it looked like one of the better spots to be in the summer.

Our party didn't have much to eat, but the nachos we had were pretty tasty. They didn't skimp on the cheese, peppers, or jalapenos, but I wouldn't say they were to die for either. The drinks selection was okay, but not extensive. Enough for our group by far however.

Service was excellent, and our group was checked up on frequently. Our waiter did seem a bit put off that we weren't ordering more food, but we did off set it with our drinking by the end of the night! Overall, our waiter and bar staff were very friendly.

If I'm in the neighbourhood, I'll definitely consider just dropping in once more and maybe trying the food this time. But for a group of 15-20, it is a pretty nice place to sit and relax. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Victory is a versatile pub which does everything well.

They actually live up to the goal of providing its patrons with reasonable food. Don't expect the food to blow you away, but it's one of the few pubs where I'd rather order there than go exploring the neighborhood for eats.

The pub is sprawled over the site of a rustic old victorian house. This is the perfect set up because it allows for several separated areas. I count at least 5 different segments, including a quaint patio which overlooks the intersection of Markham and Lennox. This gives the pub significant flexibility. On random weeknights it can easily maintain a good atmosphere in the first floor bar, while also being a reliable destination if you have a large group, even on busy summer nights.

The servers are generally friendly, but relaxed. If you want something done quickly, you may have to take the initiative.

When you factor in the great location (a stones throw from Bathurst Station), and reasonable prices, the Victory makes a compelling case as a go-to location for meeting friends."}
{"text":"I loved the Mac and Cheese. Very flavourful. Also, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"craft beer in toronto.
'nuff said."}
{"text":"Stale nachos that were basically crumbs with jarred or canned salsa / guacamole/ beans on top. Haddock tacos were flavourless and the filing was basically just green and red peppers. The atmosphere and server were nice though."}
{"text":"Sure it's a little down on its heels and who knows what going to happen when this block is eventually redeveloped but this place remains the perfect spot for a quiet pint. Fantastic draught list, packed with local beers and a decent plate of nachos to boot. Enjoy it while it lasts."}
{"text":"Good nachos are a hard thing to find in this city, because some people don't realize how important the ratio of cheese to chips is. (For the record, it should be 2:1). 

The nachos at this place where the cheesiest nachos I've ever eaten. There was an actual sheen of grease on the fromage coating. It was glorious. 

I also like this cafe (bar, really), because of its upstairs/downstairs separation which sort of reminds me of The Albion in Guelph (Hollah Guelph!). The place is decked out with basic tables and chairs as well as some more intimate booths that seat mostly two people at max. 

A REALLY fun place. 

Note: They only thing is I wish they had a better (or some kind) of wine selection. When I asked our cute Kurt Cobain (pre-heroin) waiter what wine they had he said, \"red or white\" and I sighed. And then told him he looked like Kurt Cobain but without the heroin."}
{"text":"First time there over the Easter long weekend. Really enjoyed the victory nachos with veggie chili. The service was prompt and good, would definitely go back. The place has a strong hipster vibe, and generally people are friendly."}
{"text":"I think we just had the best server I have every meet. We came in and tit was really bright where there was open seats so he found us a seat that was closer to the bar and even lowered the light. When he took out order he gave us some samples of the beers for us to try. This server just made this place awesome. 

There drink selection is also really good and the servers are very knowledgable. Also the music at this place is great for hanging out with friends. 

Check this place out before they shut it down when Honest Ed's closes down."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a saturday night with a friend. Having read that it had a good beer selection and some unusually good pub food I decided to check it out.

This place is like a bad cross between madison and scallywags. Its like a less happening version of Madison with all the different sections with a bizarre smellier-dumpier scallywags semi-pretentious kind of vibe. And I was not at all impressed by the beer selection. In fact, We didn't even stay for a beer. We just looked at the menu and left. oh yeah.. my friends chair had a whole in it."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner and had an awesome experience! 

Our server was adorable and helpful, and walked the line between letting us enjoy our food in peace and checking up to make sure we were OK very well. The beer menu is awesome - definitely give a few of them a try if you can. 

Got a mac and cheese, which everyone I knew had raveddd about (this was the reason we came here). I like to think of myself as a mac and cheese addict - gourmet: I consume embarrassing amounts of Kraft Easy Mac (Kraft Dinners in Canada?) but I'd like to think I know good mac when I taste it.

This m&c was... ok. It came with quite a bit of food - a salad starter (your arteries will probably thank you for the garden salad with the balsamic dressing option, but the Cesar salad had bacon on it!!11!!11!1!!1), garlic bread, and enough m&c for two meals (or one me). This m&c is boiled - I tend to prefer them baked (you get the nice crust!!) but it had a flavorful mix of cheeses. Something I didn't like is that they sprinkled a fair amount of cheddar on it as well, and instead of melting into the macaroni it glooped into a large glob in the center of my plate that really messed with the macaroni vs cheese ratio of every bite. The cheese sauce also had that slightly grainy texture that comes when you add flour while cooking, but the cheese doesn't melt completely smoothly. 

Pretty solid m&c. I can definitely see myself going back to Victory Cafe, but ordering something other than the m&c - they had some awesome, tasty options (pulled pork sandwich, anyone?) on the menu and I'd definitely like to try them out."}
{"text":"This pub is one of my favorites. Great atmosphere, especially in the summer. Food is solid, but I really just visit for a pint with friends. 

Waiter service has always been very friendly, even though it can be very busy and crowded."}
{"text":"This place was nestled in the nice Mirvish Village and you wouldn't really know that this is a busy place from the exterior.  In fact, it looked like any normal house until you set in and get blown away by the number of people inside.

Good beer selection.  However, this place is seriously lacking when it comes to a cocktail / non-beer menu.  When we asked about cocktails, we were told that their liquor selection was limited - not a good sign for those who aren't into the beer.  Where was the wine?  

Nice location, nice decor - poor communication of drinks."}
{"text":"The food here is on par with any other dive bar or chain sports bar. It's pretty underwhelming but priced accordingly. The beer selection is good and the patio is one of the better ones in the city.

I went to a party here once where the back upstairs room was booked. Don't do this! It was pretty cramped and the upstairs bar doesn't have taps, so you have to go downstairs to get drinks."}
{"text":"This was one of my go to places but I haven't been in a while. I came here for my birthday dinner two years in a row. And I went there on a bunch of dates too. It's a great place to just go for drinks, or for a meal. The two seat tables against the wall are very cozy and are perfect for getting to know someone.

The selection of beers are top notch, as they are all microbrewed. If you enjoy our beer then this is a place for you.

The food is pretty good too. I would recommend the mac n cheese. Although at the end it is almost too much cheese, as the taste is very strong. The chicken curry is also good. Or if you are just looking for something to nibble on with some beers I'd recommend the veggie chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I've been many times and always get the same thing, the famous Mac & Cheese. Try it and you will be beside yourself with gooey delicious joy. It's really that good."}
{"text":"The place is very casual and in a residential street. They don't even have big signs saying it's a bar or it's \"victory cafe\". It's a 2 level house turned into a bar... similar to Madison bar near Spadina. We found it only because we were actually looking for it. I like these kind of bars as they don't fancy up the place and jack up the prices for you to justify to yourself that you are having a good time. As long as you have good company you will enjoy yourself here. The drinks were watered down a lot... but what's new lol"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here, but have heard great things.

Cozy, warm, converted old house, and lots of floors to drink on. I liked that they had a private dining room too!

The best seller for me is the beers. Great beers on tap - my favourite was the wickedly hoppy \"Flying Monkeys Hoptical Illusion\"...and they're cheap."}
{"text":"my wife brings me here nearly every time i visit toronto, as mirvish village is home to alot of shops we frequent, & i never leave unsatisfied. we've never had any food until our last jaunt, where we planned on just stopping in for a few drinks after hitting up sonic boom before heading elsewhere for dinner, but the scents flowing from the kitchen were making us salivate so much that we decided to just eat there. no regrets. service is always great -- last time the bartender even indulged me in a chat session about port wine. really cool guy. the place is missing a certain wow factor that i can't place my finger on, but i'd still highly recommended it.

i have to mention that they deserve a full star in itself just because the last time i was here they were playing the entirety of the magnetic fields' 69 Love Songs."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night.

It's a very nice patio right in Mervish Village which is great... the beer selection is good, the food is very average.

DO NOT order the Nachos... they're beyond terrible.

Apparently the grilled cheese is good, but overall I don't suspect there's much above and beyond regular pub grub here."}
{"text":"I had a great time here.  Maybe it was the company, maybe it was the patio or maybe it was the cask beer but I enjoyed myself at Victory.

The good:
- good beer selection and great prices
- good looking menu 
- laid back staff (maybe too laid back) - but they let us bring over 4 chairs to a table for 2 with no problems or dirty looks
- GREAT fries with dill dipping sauce

The bad:
- our waiter was kind of a fail.  He took forever to bring us anything so much so that we went inside to pay at the bar because it was taking him so long.
- The chicken wings were just okay.  They were crispy and saucy and came with veggies and dip but they were the wrong kind of sauce.

The EXTREMELY weird:
- every single one of our wings was a wing.  There was not a single drumstick to be had.  It was eerie... but we didn't care.

Overall, I would definitely come here again.  I would order something else and not be in a rush and it would have been great."}
{"text":"wonderful cozy atmosphere, good beer, tasty fries. service was a tad slow, but not really an issue.

in my book, that would get you 3 stars. three other things put this place over the top:
- the cask beer. it was good last night (an oatmeal stout). and even if it was bad, i'm happy they have it. i love this stuff, and it can be a tiny new frontier every time you visit

- kid friendly. now, that doesn't sound like much, but let me tell you, i've been in places with similar vibes where they let you bring your kid but every hipster eye and cool kid glare is directed at you. my nephew,2 years old, came, and what i liked most was they treated all of us like any other customers. my nephew was fine, he didn't need any special treatment, but if we did need something, i got the sense we'd get it

- the other patrons. on thursday night, my sense was everyone is here to have a nice evening. they aren't raucous, they're friendly. there was no annoying group you wanted to slug, and we spent time both downstairs and upstairs"}
{"text":"When I went on weekends this place would be packed. Really nice and relaxing atmosphere.  And cheap drinks."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this establishment on Yelp and decided to try it out. We sat at the bar (as we're accustomed to doing) and ordered up some drinks and menus. 

It was a Sunday evening and the cafe was slammed. Nonetheless we were given attentive service from our bartender. 

The drinks were good (I had a local Ontario-brewed IPA, my friend had a Bloody Mary that was hand made (meaning made with Worcestershire, bitters, etc., and not with a pre-made mix). Both were delicious. 

We ordered: my friend had the borscht soup & grilled cheese sandwich, I had the chicken curry. As a rule, I despise beets -- but I gotta tell you, this soup was delicious. I ate nearly as much of my girlfriend's soup as she did, it was so good. 

The chicken curry was also really good and spicy. Humongous portion of deliciousness. 

Also, the bar had the hockey game on, so it was an all-in-all pretty awesome experience."}
{"text":"Victory Cafe has been an alright spot for me so far, but I'm sure with tweaking a few things it could work its way up to 4*!
The bar space is cute, though nothing special. If you're one who enjoys tucked away patios, Victory offers a pretty nice alternative to the Bloor St. buzz.
I've only tried the appetizers from the food menu, from which I'm a fan of the meaty wings. They offer pretty decent beers on tap including quite a few local and hoppy options. 
One of the factors that has left me with a bit of sour taste is the fact that if you come with a big group (say 25 people), and there is a big order for the group (say someone is buying all the pitchers), you are not able to order separate food. This factor basically led to my starvation during my last visit. 
Additionally, the front rooms catch a very cold breeze every time the door is opened or shut! This is a mechanism that should be taken care of in any bar in Canada! brrrrr"}
{"text":"Disappointing all around. Service was ridiculously slow, especially for a slow day (the patio wasn't even half full). 
Our server got our order wrong, and I had to wait without food while my spouse at his. When we finished, it took over 15 minutes for a bill to be brought over...after we had asked.

The best part? The weekend brunch menu is identical to the new spot on Bloor - Crafty Coyote - which just opened. I presume this means the owners are the same.... not a good impression."}
{"text":"The food deviates a bit from your typical bar menu. Samosas, curry dishes, and the mac n' cheese are the mentionables. With that said, you'll be offered the classics. Club sandwiches, burgers, nachos etc. The food is not deplorable but seems to vary greatly in quality. For example, their \"Victory Club\", which is strangely similar to McDonald's Southwest Chicken, is OK but the mashed potato side option is about as tasty as dry wall and bleached flour.  

Their beer selection is very small and my major pet peeve with Victory is that they always carry an entirely different list of beers than their menu. How much does it cost to reprint menus?!

All in all, nothing impressed me with this place. Food is hit and miss and somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"After having some tacos at Al Asador Mike S. and i came for a couple of beers.  The place is quaint and was all full on a Saturady night.  We sat at the bar as not a booth was to be had.  They were having some issues with their sound system but that didn't matter since the hockey game was on.  The waitress was great and knows her beer.  After asking her to suprise me for my second pint she picked an excellent amber with a nutty flavour.

This is a great place to hang out on a random evening and enjoy a pint with some friends."}
{"text":"Ok... but nothing to write home about. Don't understand the good reviews on here.  People in Toronto should visit some proper cafés in New York to see how average Victory Cafe is."}
{"text":"I decided to visit The Victory Café because I heard it had one of the best beer selections in Toronto. 

When I got there the place was packed. My friends and I were seated in a corner, right next to the kitchen area. I fell in love with the atmosphere inside the café: the dim-lighting, the rustic bar, people laughing and having fun! It really doesn't get any better than that. 

The waitress came and took our orders. When the waitress returned, she was carrying our beers, and she was looking very confused. She didn't know which beer was which, so she had to go back and ask the bartender. After that fiasco was settled, we tried our beers, and they were delicious. 

We decided we wanted to have some food, so we settled on the Nachos. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen. We waited a good 20 minutes for the waitress to come back and take our orders, but she never came. By the time she appeared, we had finished our beers, so we decided to eat somewhere else. We asked for the bill, and she brought it right away. 

The whole night was pretty much ruined by our waitress' inattentiveness and unfriendliness. She didn't smile once, and she seemed preoccupied and uninterested. This seems to be a problem at Victory, and I hope they correct it soon.

Victory Café: Great atmosphere, crappy service."}
{"text":"The Victory can be a good mid-day pick-me-up (did I over-hyphenate there?), a place to settle in to a heavy breakfast with a newspaper in the dead of winter, or...ONE OF THE BUSIEST WRAP-AROUND PATIOS IN SUMMAHTYME.

Located just in from the hustlebustle of Bloor and Bathurst, the Victory serves a good range of beer, and a varied menu that differentiates it from standard pub fare (more than usual number of veggie-friendly fare, international dishes like curry and samosas, and standard pairings with booze like grilled cheese and burgers).

The service, if sometimes slow, is always warm and helpful.  The food is a little hit and miss, though more consistent recently.  That said, these past months I've also been leaning towards the heart-friendly *sarcasm, gang!* sweet potato fries, nachos, veggie chilli, and garlic bread, options which arguably don't put the kitchen crew to great culinary test.   The lager cocktails come recommended (by me): Mill Street with lime cordial is a refreshing pick.

Food and libation aside: I think what I like best is that it's on a leafy street, it's small and cozy and without pretension, and that there are many wooden booths to slide into and while away some time.  With a booming celebratory voice: VICTORY CAN BE (y)OURS!

Yelp note: Torontonians flock to the patio (we're no fools!) but I find that the Victory can at times get really loud and 'undergraddy' (logical, thanks to its proximity to the University)."}
{"text":"The typical Markham street rigmarole is to start at Victory Café, fail to get a seat and then work your way northward until you end up at The Central. But should you happen to rewarded with a spot on their patio, drink it in, gentle reader. For this is where it all begins.

If there is such a thing as patio envy, then the other restos at Markham and Bloor streets must surely have it. Victory Café boasts a beast of a terrace, stretching right around a converted house. It faces both south and west which should make any pique any T.O. patio regular's curiosity. That said, it's almost always full on a pleasant day so patio-thusiasts are advised to make haste.

But the patio is (by orders of magnitude) my favourite thing about this place. The food is just OK. I probably won't start with the samosas again, but their pasta special was OK. Though the beer list is small, they have some solid options like Beau's Lug Tread. The service seems to be harried, so wear a big felt hat or illuminated spectacles or something if you want to get noticed. But other than that, the VC is A-OK with ME.

Obligatory Title Pun: VICTORY is fine.

Menu Readability: It's big and readable.

Need to mention: Much as been said about their mac and cheese.

What this place teaches me about myself: If the name of the game is patios, then we have a winner."}
{"text":"Whenever a hot summer evening rolls around, there's only one place I want to be: one of the cool kids with a spot on the Victory Patio. It's nearly impossible to get a table, especially if you're with a group, so come early...and camp out. Otherwise there's ample seating inside upstairs and down. 

Never been disappointed with the food, although I was upset that they removed their chicken fingers from the menu. But their grilled cheese and sweet potato fries are still available and delicious. Also heard great things about the homemade mac n' cheese but have yet to try it. And with your meal be sure to try one of the microbreweries they offer. Get a Stonehammer and you'll never look back, I swear."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese with gruyere, cheddar and sundried tomato pesto on Calabrese bread. Sounds great right?

Wrong.

I did not enjoy this. The pesto was sweet to the point of cloying and had I had a butter knife at my disposal I would have wiped it off the bread entirely. Everything else about the sandwich was magical, but next time I'll hold the pesto. Fries are fucking fantastic as always. Order them and try to ration your garlicky-dill dipping sauce."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite patios in the city.  It is integrated into the surrounding neighborhood with the feeling of being in a small town.  A great place to spend a warm summer night.  The menu is limited but the food is reasonably priced and the quality is surprisingly good for a place I think of for drinks."}
{"text":"Ye Ol' Vic. 

I have many memories of guzzling reasonably priced craft beers on the massive wood-lined corner patio of the Victory Café. They always stay open until 3am, and let you order multiple drinks at last call. 

The food is decent, I'm a fan of their mac and cheese, which comes with a side caesar salad. 

The bathrooms are pretty gross, but in a remarkable change of pace, are UPstairs and not in a basement.

The servers really don't give a shit, but as a regular, I find it endearing. You likely will not. 

PEPPER POINTS: For changing up their beer selection seasonally. I like pumpkin ales, no matter what you say about them."}
{"text":"I come here every single time I'm in Toronto and it's always a five-star visit.  The food is amazing and the beers are awesome too.  The atmosphere has a great pub feel and no matter which room I sit in, I always feel relaxed. 

I love the chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The specials also rock.  Last winter I had amazing mushroom gnocchi.  My sister is addicted to the mac & cheese.  She says it's the best she's ever had.  Not my cup of tea, but the bites I had of it were good!  

The service is good, although, sometimes it's a bit slow.  Only real con I can say is that they charge for soda refills.  But I love this place so much that it's still five stars!!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of decently priced craft beers.  Cool patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer but give the food a pass.  We went for an afternoon beer and a couple of munchies.  An ok selection of cans and bottles and a very good list of local draft beers.  We decided to have nachos and sweet potato fries.  The plate of nachos was too small for the mound of chips on the plate, so that the upper layer was fused with too thick a layer of cheese and those poor chips on the bottom were just naked.  The sweet potato fries were at the same time over cooked and limp.  I noticed that many things coming out of the kitchen that afternoon seemed to be blackened.  The guy at the next table waited forever to get the burger he had ordered.  His partner had already finished her meal before he was served.

I'll still go back for a beer as they have a very nice outdoor space and it is located just around the corner from our daughter's apartment.  But I'm not sure that I'll try the food again."}
