{"text":"I was very surprised. Went in to check it out and the gyro was amazing. Also ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and was surprised how big it was. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Had the biscuits and gravy the food was excellent the servings large but the wait staff service was so poor that basically I got my food and I got my check was completely ignored otherwise I don't know if I'll be back"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because of the courteous and professional response on the issues I had with their coffee bags. The food there is really amazing just was upset as we did not receive the amazing coffee we paid for. I will be going in to get the coffee promised to me and will most likely eat there as well. Thank you Sunny's Diner for responding to this problem and handling it correctly."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit!! Everything was delish! Fresh,and staff friendly... Our waitress Rachel was awesome too..."}
{"text":"I love Sunny's Diner! They have wonderful customer service and killer breakfasts. Our server Casey is always upbeat and happy to meet your requests. My friends and I come frequently to Sunny's and they are always consistent. COME TO SUNNY'S!! You won't be disappointed! :) P.S. The bacon is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Ordered the country breakfast (eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuit w. Gravy) and the Monte Cristo sandwich with fries. The food was good but not great however the price is right. The gravy on the biscuits was a little disappointing and the fries were too hard for my liking. Would definitely get a different side next time. Service was awesome. Would go here again for some cheap eats but will try some different dishes."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday breakfast. Everything was great. The food was burning hot right out of the kitchen. The waitress, Liz, was so warm and friendly. My mom had a great birthday breakfast thanks to Sunny's. :)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs , home fries and toast for $7.99. Good size portions and friendly staff. This was a good buy. Nice atmosphere. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"we came to sunny's to use our groupon today and it was not honored a stated on the group on. we were suppose to be allowed to purchase 2 dinners up to 14.99 each. that was not allowed. the owner only allowed us to purchase a sandwich or salad for a lot less money than was stated officially on the groupon. this is a bait and switch tactic which the better business bureau will also be informed about. this man lied about what was offerred and since i had to go home and confirm it obviously  we were put in a horrible position. i hope a great deal of people read this review and decide never to go to this less than honest establishment."}
{"text":"Dirtiest place ever! The blinds were filthy the floor!!!!!! The service sucked!!!!!! They forgot half of my order they mest everything up...but one thing they didnt forget was my check....never going there again"}
{"text":"Ate there once before about a week ago, had Jessica for waitress she was great! Came back again today, ordered same thing, a greek omelet gyro meat on side, not in omelet, and was told by different waitress that the boss told her I can NEVER order meat on side again! I told her I would order how I like, thanks. I was also told to wait for this omelet today would be at least 30 minutes?? Confused and hungry I asked for a piece of toast while I wait, she said I would have to pay for that?? Again, confused why someone who has to wait for food so long, because kitchen is backed up is beyond restaurant etiquette... as I know it. Waited,  was brought out my toast 30 minutes before my omelet, even though I asked for ONE piece, so as to leave ONE piece left for the meal itself. Please tell me, what the heck is the difference if gyro meat is in or out of omelet? They just lost a regular customer that would have given them... $572.00 per year, and that's not including my guests that would come w/me. that will NO LONGER eat here either!"}
{"text":"I'll let you know how the food was when I FINALLY eat. I came in as a group of 14 so a longer than usual wait is acceptable but we've been here for 40+ minutes. We had to suggest a way to seat us to the servers and they still got it wrong. We were sat at three different tables so we couldn't even talk to each other so the long pass wait was for nothing.  Maybe the manager could have been some help but apparently decided to delegate to teenaged girls. NEVER coming here again and if you're part of a large group you should probably look elsewhere. I just saw a couple who came in after us pay for their food. They literally were seated before us, were served and were able to pay before we even ordered."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get breakfast! I have had multiple dishes here both breakfast and lunch! The service is amazing, always having a full cup of coffee. Sunnys French Toast was delicious, best French Toast I've ever had -hands down!!"}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE.  1st somebody took my food from the check out counter. Then they charge me for the food and said \" Sergio took your food\" . I gave them the food back and said give it to the homeless. He then replied \" I will throw it in the trash\" . WORD TO THE WISE SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSWHWRE."}
{"text":"Sunny's diner is nothing short of amazing! The owner (Alex) greeted and sat us, he's friendly and answered our questions. Our server (Alex a female) took over and was very tentative. OMG the food is amazing, I had the Huevos Rancheros; soooooo good! My husband had his heart set on greek so he ordered the greek omelette with biscuits and gravy on the side. It was so yummy I tried stealing some of his meal! I recommend the rose blossom tea as a drink it's local and very tasty. If I could give extra stars I would! We will be back! OFTEN!"}
{"text":"5 stars for awesome over the top customer service by Casey. He was super friendly and made our breakfast experience memorable. Our group of 7 Angel fans enjoyed our meals and delightful service. We ate there twice over the last few days. 4 of us had the corned beef hash both days, we would highly recommend the Irish Benedict or Irish omelette. Coffee was superb! Thanks so much Casey, keep up the great work. We well definitely be back next year during Spring training!"}
{"text":"Here we are at Sunny's Diner perched on the corner of McClintock and University. Being a huge fan of the TV show: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, their name stood out and we gave it a try, whatever gets you into the door I guess!   This is a super chill spot and the food is a great deal. It appears to be a younger, early 20's serving team and I think they must also have a person that just goes around refilling coffees. I couldn't chug mine fast enough for someone to be there on the refill, I usually leave Sunny's feeling pretty wired and extremely full."}
{"text":"I decided to choose sunnys for lunch this afternoon on my way home. Ordered a turkey club with no tomato and fries to go. When I called, the hostess was very friendly and took my order perfectly. As I walked into the diner the cold ac was a nice relief from the heat. Older folks may want to bring a sweater tho. I was directed to the host stand by a male server where my food was waiting for me. Transaction was smooth and the staff was friendly wishing me a good day as I left. When I got home I was impressed by how well the food was presented and tasted. Fries didn't taste previously frozen, and the turkey had wonderful flavor. They also put in plenty of condiments and silverware which was is a nice touch that most restaurants skim on. Overall, sunnys impressed me when I wasn't expecting to be impressed. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was really craving some good breakfast food and I'd never been here so we decided to try it out. When we sat down we noticed that there was a bowl of empty creamer containers still sitting at the table with us. Service was nice enough. I ordered the pancho omlet which I had seen pictures of on yelp. In the pictures it looked light and tasty. When the food arrived I realized it was dripping from grease. I was only able to eat about half of it and now I'm regretting eating that much. I got tortillas with it and when unrolling them there was little bits of lettuce in it, makes you wonder what else they could have had on them. The home fries tasted like a week old French fry found under a seat, but with less flavor. Really wish I had gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Groupon deal was a joke. We paid $16.00 for the Groupon, had four meals and still over $40.00.for everything. The food was very mediocre  and the pictures the have on the menus is not there food at all . The owner was nice and the place was dead at dinner ,so we had no problem getting served. But we will not ever go back."}
{"text":"If I could be completely honest.....PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE! If i could give it 0 stars I would. The owner Alex is very rude and creates a hostile environment for guests and customers alike. He curses at his workers in front of guests and disrespects everyone around him. Today I was in eating breakfast and I was present for an argument he was having with an employee of his. Apparently he fired her and found it necessary to do this in front of the staff and a full restaurant while cursing at her and telling her to get out while taunting her waving and saying bye. That is not professional and no one should have to deal with that talk from their boss. And last week while I was there, there was a group of servers and a male manager discussing the owner Alex and how he is potentially stealing tips from employees. This is enough to make you want to not support this restaurant. I have been in the restaurant business for over 15 years and this is the most poorly run establishment I have been to in a very long time. DO NOT SUPPORT THE OWNER ALEX OR HIS BUSINESS!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was also acceptable.  They were not very busy.  Price was higher than what I expected. Overall I would probably return."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my family and had the worst service of my life. We ordered our food and it took awhile for it to get out to us but they were extremely busy so we understood that. When we got our food everyone really liked it all. The food was great but the service was horrible. After not seeing our waitress for about 20 minutes we finally flagged down another server who informed us our waitress quit in the middle of her shift after an argument with the manager. No other server came around to fill our water cups and it really seemed like they were avoiding the side of the restaurant we were on completely. After about 30 minutes of sitting there we finally had someone fill up our water and then continued to wait another 10 minutes for the to go boxes we asked for.  When we got up to pay the person working the register completely ignored us so we left our check on the table. We could have very easily left the restaurant without paying at all.  I'll go back to a restaurant if I don't like the food because I can always order something different but I will not go back to a restaurant that has bad service."}
{"text":"I love little mom and pop restaurants! Sunny's Diner is consistently delicious and very reasonably priced! I always get great service! French toast is my favorite here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is Fe-nominal if you can order. Or I should say if the kitchen does not have \"too many tickets\" to seat you.  It was over 100 degrees outside. Water and a table would have been nice. Stood and waited for 45 min. looking at seven empty tables. This was my favorite place in valley for breakfast.   I get the picture. I will never contribute to the tickets for the kitchen again. I am very  sorry I inconvenienced you. As long as I live, it will never happen again. Please accept  my apology."}
{"text":"I had biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and my girlfriend Tessa had a grilled cheese with bacon, curly fries, and a root beer float. Everything was awesome. Prices are what you expect for this type of place and the service was great. It was 230 in the afternoon on a Thursday, so it wasn't busy. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelpers! I'm in Phoenix for some spring training games, my plane lands early and I have time to grab breakfast. On the way is Sunny's...which was pretty damn good. Let me start with the super-friendly staff who were good with my questions and had some rock-solid recommendations. I had the signature waffle - which comes with heaping piles of bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The whipped cream was nice but I could have lived without the cinnamon. The waffle came with a side of eggs and sausage which were mediocre. My friend had the Denver omelette which she described as \"pretty damn tasty\". The omelette came with home fries which were good. A huge plus for Sunny's for the coffee. I expected bulk burned crap, but found a nice cup. They brew into thermoses (or is the plural thermi?) and buy whole bean coffee from a local roaster. They could rate 4 stars just for that! But overall this was an excellent recommendation from the yelp community."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I come here every Friday morning for a cheap and amazing breakfast with my friends"}
{"text":"The service was prompt, friendly and accommodating. I ordered \"things your way\" with a Belgian waffle, eggs and homefries. The waffle was overdone and just dry and crunchy but our server had it replaced quickly with the French toast I wanted instead. Overall, a great classic filling breakfast for me. However, my boyfriend was disappointed with the steak in the lumberjack breakfast. It was like a thin hamburger patty. He didn't speak up about it, but we recommend that you don't get it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the BEST breakfast place in Tempe stop! This is it! Quality food, large portions, reasonably priced, great customer service. We have super picky kids and they made sure everything came out perfect! I had a spinach and feta omelette (which is not easy to find in AZ) that was made with real eggs and actual feta cheese and it came with these incredible homemade potatoes and toast which I substituted for fruit. Coffee was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"What a great Find!!!! I have been looking for a neighborhood diner experience, you know a place where everyone knows your name. Well starting the Alex and the staff at Sunny's Diner, they welcome you warmly at each visit.  I have been trying different breakfast items and have enjoyed them all!  They offer student discounts to ASU students so how can you lose.  I recommend this newly re-opened restaurant with a North Eastern flare. And hey Alex isn't bad on the eyes... just sayin people !"}
{"text":"A bit of confusion when we were asked to wait for a table when there were 10 available so we sat ourselves. Casey our server was great. Quick food, in and out."}
{"text":"You're better off going to Chompies down the street. Service here sucks, food is average at best. At one point I noticed the manager come out and grope one of the waitresses. Every time I come here I am more disappointed."}
{"text":"Our experience was not good.  Although it was a bit busy we were seated right away.  After waiting 45 minutes, one dish for our party arrived cold.  We waited another 5 minutes for two of the other 3 dishes to arrive.  The last dish arrived separately and was cold.  After complaining about the cold food they didn't apologize and the manager offered to take 15% off the bill.  He refused to talk to us.  Two of us ended up not eating."}
{"text":"The food is decent  and the service is good also- However- the management is terrible. My friend treated me to breakfast here not long ago. She specifically asked them to use her debit card as DEBIT. They didn't listen and charged it as credit instead- then they waited 26 days to try and take the money out of her account. My friend is on a fixed income and did NOT expect them to take so long. When she called to complain- she didn't even get an apology. The manager actually told her she should have checked her bank account. Well now they have lost TWO customers for good."}
{"text":"Omg. I was yet expecting such grreat food from a place named Sunnys diner. The California omelet with chicken and avacados. Amazing. Fruit waffle what a treat"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!!! Very family friendly with delicious food. My favorite is the California omelette--chicken is fantastic. And the home fries are so yummy with really great seasoning. The service is awesome and very friendly. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've visited Sunny's during breakfast  many times! Every time I've gone wether it be with a big or small party, they never disappoint.   When you first walk in you are sure to be greeted by one or two friendly employees and sat shortly after. Even when there are several parties waiting on Saturday/Sunday mornings they do an awesome job seating you promptly.   The food is GOOD, taste home made! But my favorite aspect of this location is the friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Yummy comfort breakfast food. Good fast service. Nice place to grab a quick tasty breakfast. Boyfriend loved the chicken fried steak and I loved the biscuit."}
{"text":"I woke up craving eggs Benedict on my birthday; turned to yelp and was introduced to Sunny's. The hostess walked us to our table and in no time had our beverage at our table.   Coffee is freshly grounded  YUMMY more please really no need to say,,, the waiters are on Top of it.  The staff is friendly with warm faces, I predict ASU Students.. GO Sparky!! Being at Sunny's has a better feeling than the chain restaurants!. Our table ordered El Patron a Must try layers of yummyness the flavor in the Chorizo is mmmm that's how I remember it.  Now for The Eggs Benedict the ingredients in the Olga called out to me I just new this plate was what my mouth watered for.  I placed my fork on top and sliced it right down the middle no  runny mummy yolk :(  If you know you're Egg's Benedict do not order them here. Lots of regulars which is a plus. Yes I will be back for the Outstanding Service and The Amazing Coffee.  So many more items on the menu to try."}
{"text":"Casey the tall gentleman delivered delightful service. My order of pancakes was scrumptious and coffee was hot and perfect. I will be a returning customer!  Also I would like to add the staff in general offered good service and seemed happy working together."}
{"text":"Sunny's isn't a hard place to write a review for and most things are negative. Be very wary of this diner.  As stated in other reviews the carpets are beyond needing to be cleaned and replaced and most of the servers always appear dirty. They need to employee a standard for clean clothes, good order taking books that are not ripped up and uniformity. I know you are a diner but dang first impressions are everything.   What is driving the bad review at first was a comment from their own wait staff that they employ for cash undocumented workers in the back. I mentioned are you sure and they pointed and said see right there.  This is another matter onto itself that I am reporting.   But the food is bland and two separate dishes looked about the same. The use of cheese is overly used and we have to scrape most off to finish it. Better food and cleanliness can be found most anywhere else.   While this is a diner for college students take a little pride and clean up your business."}
{"text":"I came across town from Avondale for an appointment, I always look for something different than the average Joe or corporate.   You just can't beat this place! Thank you Katie for the wonderful service.  You can tell these servers are happy with their place of employment!  The teamwork definately shows!  I had a Greek burger and curly fries.  Boyfriend had the Freddy scramble with home fries Luv them tators! Give the cook a kiss for me, good job!    Refreshing to dine at a place that cares for their customers!    From one server to another,  great job everyone!  Thank you, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Great service with exceptional food! Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. First time here but won't be my last."}
{"text":"Sunny's ,You mean, SUCKY's? I will never go back there, we stood up front and no one even acknowledge us and ask some one if we seat ourselves, she said yes, if we find a clean table, we sat down , the table wasn't wiped down, the busser got us drinks, the server finally got our order , most of the stuff are not on the menu,I had to get own silver wares, food took forever to get, and then when my family got it , my food was cold, my husband stake was over cooked, we just ate it and got out check.NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Went in Saturday morning with my honey. Ordered corned beef hash with tomatoes ate most of my food and picked up my last tomato and surprise a small black hair. Told my waitress and she apologized and that was it. No manager coming over to apologize, no let me take a coffee off your bill. NADA! Will never go back"}
{"text":"I got the french toast and upgraded to a full meal with their homestyle fries and bacon. The french toast was really good and the homestyle fries were delicious. I would describe them as chunky hash browns, rather than the typical strands. The bacon was alright. My brother ordered the biscuits and gravy and was satisfied with them.  The service seemed slow. It wasn't packed, but we had to constantly wait for our waiter to walk by to ask for simple things like silverware or refills.  The pricing seemed right for a sit down breakfast place. Overall, I would definitely go back for their food!"}
{"text":"Lots of food, awesome service, cheap prices, and consistently good prices! The biscuits and gravy are on point, but come hungry, as the portions are enormous!"}
{"text":"You either like Sunny's Diner or you're wrong. Amazing breakfast, hash browns are the best I've had, chicken fried steak and eggs are amazing. Good service too!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! Great breakfast spot, come here with friends regularly and we always leave satisfied, the staff is very friendly and servers are on point. Casey is one of the best servers you can get, always makes sure you are happy and full. Great place!"}
{"text":"Recently went to Sunny's Diner for a large family reunion. We were able to make reservations, for a party of 13.  Server did a great job. Food came quickly.  And Refills provided promptly."}
{"text":"First you must know that they have not been there for 35 years because the previous owners did not sell it till 20 years ago. You will still find old items on the menu from the previous restaurant, but these items were the saving grace of this dining experience. As we entered the establishment we waited to be seated, and we were not greeted till for about five minutes. It wasn't till walking out the door that someone came up to is to offer us a table. So we decided to stay, and after we were sat we waited again for some server to come up to the table. Finally the server asked for our drink order, and when we came back she bolted away from the table. When she returned after a long delay we placed our order. The food came out quickly(thank the guys in back for that!). I ordered the Tex-Mex with chorizo which is an item from the old menu that they still have. Then my boyfriend ordered one of the gyros. The food was decent, but I was never asked if I wanted a coffee refill. It came to the point that I did the awkward cup shuffle. You know when you put your cup over to the side of the table, and hope that your server will see and refill your drink. Well it didn't happen, and our server didn't even return to ask how the food was. The server came back and it was only to drop off the check, and she bolted away again. As she bolted away I was trying to ask her for something and she didn't even return. We payed the bill and we left. There was no management that was running the establishment at all. The service and servers are horrible. Never again would we go here or recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I go on Sunday mornings, even when its crowded, the wait staff is friendly and cool.  This place does well with people of all ages, from ASU students to middle aged to elderly.  Great big menu, if I want breakfast its there, or lunch, no worries.  Its all been good and what you expect for a diner, nothing more.  I will have to come for dinner some day.  I love good, dependable places like this, it makes me return."}
{"text":"We always get the farmers scrambled - it is delicious! Their coffee is smooth and they are good with refilling often. Sometimes we get a Belgian waffle too - yummy. The girls serving there are very sweet. Personally, I could never serve that type of clientele, so props to those girls!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food comes out fast, and the prices are great, especially for the portions. The food is always fresh too. I've had the fajita skillet, the California skillet, and my husband has had the chocolate chip pancakes and country fried steak. So far we haven't found something we didn't love. This place isn't pretentious and there isn't a wait! Just a solid diner with great food. I've also seen the servers talk their regular guests. I love that they remember their customers."}
{"text":"Classic diner in a traditional style, ala east coast. Friendly and quick service with a healthy array of breakfast and lunch options."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here on Saturdays, very helpful staff and fast and courteous service. The manager or owner I'm not sure which is a nice and courteous person. There have been a few times when I have sat at the bar and seen him make sure service was done correctly and scold the waitresses for doing something wrong that may have done harm to the cafe's name. Good place, order anything and you will be happy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here about 7pm on a Wednesday. After driving multiple places and being undecided yet, my boyfriend and I just settled on the closest option. I never had much interest seeing this place in passing, but we walked in and it actually had a really nice feel. It was cute like a classic diner with a modern college twist and way better food then your typical diner. My boyfriend ordered a French dip that was on special for $5.99! He loved it. I had a turkey club but almost got a skillet. Sandwich was good and according to our awesome friendly server the skillet was yummy too. Her name was Jessica and she was extremely helpful and personable. Also this place has a broad menu, serves breakfast all day, and literally has every side from sweet potato fries to a baked potato to jello and everything in between. Good prices, good service, good traditional diner food. Also the server informed us that the owner was a really good guy that \"ran things like they should be ran.\"  So we will be back for breakfast and recommend it for any meal of the day!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality of food served.   We went to Sunny's Diner for a leisurely sit-down breakfast. It looked to be a fair place owned by a family, and we had hoped to find a good \"hole in the wall\" place to eat breakfast, rather than our old standby.   I was served my first ever shell in my egg. That's not a deal-breaker but was surprising. In all my years of eating eggs cooked in this fashion I had never crunched into an eggshell fragment while eating.   We ordered off the \"special\" menu and believed our dishes were $3.99 each. We added fruit & whipped cream after asking how much fruit came with the $2.50 upgrade price--the waitress told us a large handful of strawberries, a large handful of blueberries, and a whole banana would adorn each of our now-$6.49 meals.   This was not the case.   And our meals were an extra dollar each. When pointing out the price on the menu to the waitress, she said other people had been fooled by that, too, and offered to take the $2 off our bill--and then did not.   All in all, it comes down to this: I was lied to, misdirected, and given a fraudulent product. And the product itself was so-so, earning a Waffle House 3-star \"meh\" rating on its own merits.   We will not be going back. I hope others have better luck at Sunny's Diner than we did."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and filling! Plus, the prices are pocket friendly! I definitely recommend. We always stop here for breakfast if want to eat out at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch today . The service was great and the breakfast food very good! My son had the country breakfast and couldn't finish it. My husband had the special with two eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and toast. He actually managed to eat it all. I had egg beaters and bacon, tomato, and pancakes. I can see why there is a wait for seating. Endless coffee, hot and good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not really an affordable option for breakfast anymore as it looks like New York City prices have come to Sony's Diner.  The service is excellent if you are one of the known regulars otherwise it is just ok"}
{"text":"We went to Sunny's for the first time yesterday.  It was excellent! The service was fantastic.  The food came out fast and was delicious!  We even went back again today! Same thing, great service!  Food was great! We will end up being regulars! I will support locally owned over a chain ANY DAY!"}
{"text":"Now don't expect a great dining experience. Expect a great \"diner\" breakfast at a great price. The French toast is perfect and all egg dishes are awesome. Service was friendly, but the place need some freshening up to get the last star. Again it's a diner in a strip mall and not a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"Three stars overall with an extra star for the best home fries anywhere. Service is friendly. Prices are about what you'd pay at a chain restaurant. But truly, worth a visit just for those home fries."}
{"text":"I thought Sunny's was a great value, the food was good, and the staff was very friendly, and the eating area was very clean.  Normally, I would have given them 4 stars.  The reason I did not is because of the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom.  I realize it is hard to keep up with, but it is necessary for your customers.  Also, this is 2015.  Who does not have toilet seat covers in a public bathroom?  I will happily try Sunny's again, but if the restroom is that dirty again, it will be the last."}
{"text":"Good dive breakfast place. Not the best quality ingredients, but that's not what anyone is looking for in a textbook 'greasy spoon.' The staff was nice and the service was quick--even on the weekend."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is back! The Greek omelette is my favorite. Every time I've had breakfast here, I've never been disappointed. Service is decent. Location isn't bad. I suggest this place for breakfast for anyone in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Very basic diner. Decent coffee and service, but otherwise  disappointing.  Instead of going with the inexpensive artery clogging traditional diner breakfast, I paid $8 for \"protein power pancakes\" which looked great but seemed to have vinegar in the batter.  A very sour and unpleasant taste, so they were inedible.  I complained but was still charged the full price. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here before work for breakfast. The portions are always big and yummy, enough for me to take the rest and have it for lunch. The servers have always been so nice and attentive to me!"}
{"text":"Awful, slow, should have walked out in the 15 minutes we sat and waited for a server to come to our table. Food was tasty and was the only thing that came in a decent amount of time. Then, we waited for another 10-15 minutes with our plates still in front of us for our check, before we went to the front to pay. Of course the server said \"I was just going to bring your check\" of course you were, would have been nice about 15 minutes prior. Needless to say, we will not be back, it's not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The food was great, perfect temperature, taste was just like home made cooking.  The portions were large which was great for my hubby he ate half of my food. The place was full but not so full that I had to wait very long to be seated. Waiters were nice and friendly.  I will be going back for lunch to try the burgers, the couple at the next table ordered lunch and it looked delicious.  Oh and the price was reasonable. So definitely going back."}
{"text":"I fucking love french toast. It's great, this place is pretty fast too so I was pumped."}
{"text":"The breakfast foods are amazing. Especially the breakfast specials. Homefries are divine so are the pancakes. And the coffee is amazing. All around a great place.   One mistake I made here is ordering the spaghetti. The spaghetti I would give a 1 star rating. It's a given that spaghetti from a diner is a mistake but given a chance it was surely a mistake. They boast it has a Greek flare, which is all-around gross. But the portion is grossly generous & the marinara sauce has an overly herb flavor.   But I still give Sunny's a 5star rating solely based on the breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the quality of the food but the service was horrible.  The management is incredibly disrespectful. We all ordered the \"breakfast special\" that is advertised on the website. We all specifically stated that we wanted the \"special\". However when our food was delivered, they were all full sized orders. When we questioned the waitress she said they no longer had the special. The so called manager came to our table and was incredibly rude and unprofessional. We ended up paying for our drinks and left, simply because of the rudeness of the management. He didn't even offer to try to fix the situation. Please don't bother..."}
{"text":"We've gone to Sunny's a few times now for breakfast and I think it's very much the kind of breakfast place you'd expect in a college town - one that has mediocre food but decent prices. I've gotten the 2 eggs, home fries, sausage or bacon, & toast special which costs only $3.99. In my experience, the home fries are always mushy and pretty unappetizing & the turkey sausage is alway dry. The greek omelet is pretty tasty ... especially the side of tzatziki.  Our last experience with the service was interesting - our waitresses Jennifer came to check on us about 6 times within like 10 minutes! We placed our order & our food was brought out to us. She came to make sure everything looked okay - completely okay. She came back again 2 more times to ask if everything was okay - a little annoying. And what put us over the top was that she came over to our table right when I was putting my last bite of food in my mouth & asked if any plates can be taken away. Ummm, I guess? I know it wasn't all that busy at the place but this was just over the top!"}
{"text":"Hey, so I'm kind of new to writing Yelp reviews. Recently went to San Fran where I survived off of using it, so I'm going to try paying it back in Tempe. :)  I've been coming to Sunny's for about a year. I don't usually like eating out in Tempe because I'm a poor grad student, and I can survive off ramen if I have to. But Sunny's is a place I find myself at at least once a week. This is diner food. That's it's strength! I'm a convert to the chili burger, and when I'm here with friends they keep the coffee cups full. My burgers have always been perfectly cooked, heaped with chili, cheese, and a splash of pico de gallo. I like to drown my food in hot sauce and the fries are always hot.  The owner is the kind of guy that will sit down and chat with you about your day, the food, his family's history in the food business (his folks run a Greek diner over in the Sun City/Glendale area). You can spend an hour here just reading and sipping at your coffee- nobody will ever shoo you out. The staff have ended up knowing us by name and seating us at \"our\" table, which is over by the window, facing University.  I'll be blunt; if there are bad reviews here, it's from people that don't know the area and don't know what they want. Sunny's is not gourmet, vegan-friendly, gluten-free food. I like restaurants that can make those accommodations but I don't expect every restaurant ever to cater to obscure allergies. This is not a steakhouse that's got $40 ribeye waiting on the grill for you at 10am.  Just give this place a try, and go for that comfort fried food you know you want- chicken tenders, chorizo skillets, burgers or THE PANCAKES. This is the best breakfast joint in town! You want to eat somewhere where the staff will remember you and enjoy the experience of having YOU come in? This is the place.  Hope you come in soon and have the kind of hometown experience me and my friends have. :)"}
{"text":"When I finally decided to try this place this morning after driving by it for years, having a $16.47 breakfast wasn't the plan.  The menu is great and I knew I should've chosen something besides the meat lovers breakfast.  That's what i chose and here's what I received.  Eggs over medium were cooked perfect, home fries were very bland. The breakfast meats, bacon, sausage links and ham were extremely cheap low quality stuff, nothing special at all. To top it off I received a hard old biscuit and a side if gravy that I paid $1.79 extra for.  $2.49 coffee was good.  Service was good as well.  My gripe is food cost versus quality.  I paid $16.47 for what I know couldn't have cost them more than $3.  I don't mind paying more $$$ for quality, just didn't get it here today with what i ordered."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now with my girlfriend and her daughter.  Each time we have come, this place did not disappoint.  We have only come for breakfast, so keep that in mind.  However, the service was great and the food was just as good.  I have had the pancakes and the french toast and neither was a disappointment!  They understand when you tell them that you want your bacon not overly crispy, as alot of places now days are bringing back bacon that resembles an emery board.  Great food, great prices, and very clean and friendly.  A must if you are on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Hash browns = gross.  Waitresses = stressed.  Kitchen was backed up over 40 minutes. ... what kind of diner can't handle a dining room that is not even filled up?  Also,  it is not appetizing to listen to a boss who was yelling at the wait staff... YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO GO BACK THERE... waste of $20!"}
{"text":"This place is so easy to overlook but so delicious! The waitresses were really friendly and attentive. The food was amazing diner style food. I got the Greek breakfast skillet with gyro meat, feta, eggs, potatoes, and peppers. It was so good. They didn't skimp on anything!   I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"We always like to find little diners we hate food chains, diners typically have better home style food. Sunnys was a huge let down! Their biscuit tasted like add water $1 store pancake mix (same goes for the pancakes we shared) the omelette was not cooked all the way through and was overloaded on spinach and greasy cheese, the home style fries their \"specialty hashbrowns\" were burnt and had some type of sugary consistency.  I felt sick several minutes after eating and chose to just pay the check and leave, I left the waitress a $2 tip for a $20 check and then heard another waitress who happened to walk by our table tell her what I left her and our waitress said \"are you f***ing kidding me\" I'm sorry but this is not a place we will return to. On a whole the food was mediocre at best and the waitress was rude I tipped 10% which is normal and she was extremely ungrateful."}
{"text":"So... Went here because it was super close to my house, and it had great reviews. Well let me talk about the pros first.  Pros: They have a AWESOME PAINTING OF ITALY! really cool love it. They have great coffee.   Cons: Supper stuffy and hot when I walked in the door. Had to ask to turn on the fan nearby.  I ordered a waffle anything but airy and soft. I was hungry so I ate it.  Was a bit confused on why a cup of fruit was not an alternative for a side. Instead you had to pay extra for it. Not a reasonable extra like 3 dollars extra for like this tiny bowl of fruit. Really disappointed at that because for the amount of money you paid for the food it was very little. Don't mind paying the amount if its worth it."}
{"text":"Brunch.   Huge menu that focuses on breakfast.   Eggs Benedict was perfect.  2 family members had the salads, which are huge.  Friendly staff, very attentive.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The food is great, the service is good and to boot it's really cheap. I love their French toast especially when covered with fresh fruit. I'm a fan of their omelets too."}
{"text":"Probably my 4th or 5th time eating at Sunny's and it's been great every time. Service is spot on and the food has been tasty. I've only eaten breakfast here so I can't speak on the burgers and such  but the price is right. This last trip we got 2 skillets and coffee for $21. Definitely filled us up!"}
{"text":"Sunny's is the best meal I've had since moving to Arizona eight years ago. The gyros served rivals any I've had anywhere, and I've had gyros all over this country!  The food and excellent, friendly customer service will make you feel like you're the most important person to ever walk through their doors.  I HIGHLY recommend the Greek breakfast skillet, or a gyros sandwich. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile now and it never fails to leave me full and satisfied! This place has great food with great pricing, including the ASU discount. The owner Alex is a great guy and goes out of his way to make sure your experience is enjoyable. All the servers at Sunny's are friendly, attentive and help to make you feel at home. I suggest the California omelette! You won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic today!  We had the French toast and biscuits and gravy along with home fries and sausage. The sausage was filled with flavor. It's been years since we have been here and the new owners have done a great job of keeping the same casual atmosphere while adding a better menu. Great job!"}
{"text":"First time there - we don't live in the area but had to drop someone off at the airport. We will come back excellent service, friendly and ready to serve. Breakfast was yummy Greek and Denver Omelets served with fresh potatoes and your choice of side - pancakes, toast. Fresh fruit and many more items."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food, reasonable prices. My Greek burger was delicious and their homemade rice pudding was tasty. We really enjoyed our visit and have gone to try and eat their again but their hours don't seem to be consistent, the sign with the hours said they were supposed to be open but they weren't. I would have given it 4 if the hours more consistent."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my folks.  Everything tasted great; service was fast and cheerful, food arrived quickly.  If these old reviews complaining about the service are accurate, they seem to have made changes, because I cannot see a hint of a problem.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from East Mesa and once we got there, they told us to leave because they were closing before their official closing time. So not only did they close before they said they would, the door was open and their sign said \"open\". I got there with enough time to order & eat. The manager handled it unprofessionally and is not a place that I will be spending money at."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was on Point! I had Olga's Benedict and the Signature Waffle and I am pleasantly satisfied! The service was also good."}
{"text":"The ol' bait n' switch... Advertises specials on their website menu, but apparently discontinued all of them a long time ago. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Me and my wife just moved to the area and we saw Sonny's. Little did I recognize that they thought Starbucks was a breach in the health code they told us to leave or pour are Starbucks down the drain we just left we do not like hostility you guys have fun with your own coffee we will be sure not to come back"}
{"text":"Tried this place during our 1st weekend in PHX and we weren't disappointed! Honey had the Greek omelette which he enjoyed and our biscuits & gravy were delicious. Flavored creamer for our coffee? We're happy!"}
{"text":"Was here for 10 mins. They have like 10 waitress just standing around. We ordered our drinks and was Looking at the menu. Our waitress Alex was nice at first but then when we told her we were not going to order food her rudeness came out. I went to pay for our drinks and it came too $9.00 with a side of rudeness from Alex. I asked her for a receipt (because there was no way 3 drinks came to $9.00) Alex asked me if I wanted the receipt broken down, I was yes of course. She printed my receipt and then walked away while the other girl finished with me. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Can't compare the food since I'm not from the area but great service and awesome crew. Can't go wrong with a girl actually named Sunny working the front. Will be back when visiting. :)"}
{"text":"The Hub and I ate here last weekend, reminds me of Abdows from the east coast in the late 80's, diner feel, much nicer than any Denny's. Country breakfast was good and so was the HUGE french toast!"}
{"text":"Saturday mornings my husband, son and I go out for \"Saturday Morning PJ Breakfast\" it's a chance to try a new place and be silly in our 'Jammie's.   We drove by Sunnys constantly while living in Tempe and finally decided to stop. I am so glad we did. This is our favorite breakfast spot.   They're always hustling even when they aren't super busy. The wait staff are friendly and sweet To my son. They have a great menu filled with comfort food, and some new treasures.   I am absolutely in love with the Irish Benedict. It's a gorgeous take on eggs Benedict with corned beef hash instead of tradition ham. It takes all my self control not to order it every time we visit. Their potatoes are also perfect every time.   Their kids menu is perfect sized for my toddler and he loves their pancakes.   Anyone who is in Tempe and hungry for breakfasts needs to visit Sunnys."}
{"text":"The people who own this place have a lot to learn about doing business. The ribeye steak that came with my eggs was a flank steak,  Not a ribeye. The steak was a third fat that I had to get rid of. Unfortunately this was my first experience at this diner and the owner and his buddy decided to sit at the booth next to me. Because there were no other diners in the immediate area I could not help but overhear their entire conversation. Conversation consisted of complaints about servers needing pens, the awkwardness of singing happy birthday to people when you don't know their names, it went on and on.  After 7 years in the food service industry I already knew about all of the problems.  They're normal.   And I didn't enjoy the owner's bitch session.   It ruined my meal. Who in their right mind is having these conversations in front of customers?"}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food was just okay. I probably wouldn't eat there again but I still enjoyed my food! Good little diner"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved into the area recently and we decided to try this diner close by.  The wait staff were mostly in training and they we're pretty busy, but the food was good quality. It was the best French toast I have ever had. My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak, hashbrowns and eggs which also looked really good. The coffee wasn't great but I will definitely be going back for the food!"}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience! The best service and amazing food! The staff here is very friendly! The food is amazing and overall the experience is awesome !! The price is very reasonable and I couldn't ask for more in a local breakfast spot!! They treat you like family !! I never have any complaints here"}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are better, biscuits enormous and the service is incredible and friendly. Eating here again when I comeback to Arizona."}
{"text":"(Formerly) Two stars for the food being pretty good breakfast fare. I came at the wrong time because a local cross fit employee was there and I couldn't get a servers' focus after that. They chatted with him while I would loudly call out to finally get their attention to get anything from coffee or water to even adding to my order (that's more money for you!). This was really annoying. Also an employee was sleeping in a booth. I've worked in restaurants since I was 14 and haven't seen that during regular business hours. Next to the sleeping server was her coworkers eating breakfast and chatting on cell phones. No one on the floor checking customers.  I'd heard this place had bad service but, since moving in next door, I thought I'd give it a chance and find a new breakfast place to bring friends and go before work. I'm not taking my family to a place with people sleeping in booths and waitresses more interested in how some dude's big day at the gym is going to be than a paying customer who works management and likes to tip but would fire this whole staff. Thanks for the check in the middle of eating so you could get back to breakfast and your phone. I put my credit card down and timed it on my phone to test the already bad service. Ten minutes to pick it up AND YOU GAVE IT TO A DIFFERENT PERSON!!! I was here for thirty minutes and a third of it was waiting for my card you gave to a stranger. Enjoy your rest. You won't see me again.   Follow up (Now one star): Asked a guy behind the counter if there was a manager and said there wasn't one but, \"What's the problem?\" I told him the sleeping server was a bad thing thing to have. His giggling response was, \"Huh huh, yeah...\" as if unprepared or hungover workers were the norm. Thanks, bro. Seriously, sleep in the closet. Hell, the walk-in. Don't do it right in the dining room. I'll be at work later where everyone is awake, cleaned up and ready to work or they're going home. I wish I went to McDonald's across the street. At least I can find the manager there."}
{"text":"Sunny's has the BEST hangover food ever. It's amazing. The staff is eclectic and the booths are kind of like sitting on plain plywood but the food keeps you coming back.  FYI: the only major draw back for me is the coffee tastes worse than brewed dirt.  I started bringing my own coffee and then I couldn't sing anymore praises."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was hankering for biscuits and gravy.   I arrived at 8:30 on a Tuesday morning and only six people were eating. After perusing the big menu, I actually settled on the Irish Benedict. It came to $12.39 after tax.   I had a good server (Jennifer), who gave me good attention with a pleasant attitude. Another server seated some of her friends, who insisted on sitting in the closed section. They were obnoxiously loud and vulgar and she allowed it. Later, when they got some scowls from the six other diners, she hushed them.   On to breakfast: the eggs were overcooked but not by much. The breakfast potatoes were good, with a mix of fluffy and crunchy potatoes and no peppers, yay!  The Muffin was pretty tough tho and required a knife. The corned beef hash good, with a good balance of meat to potatoes."}
{"text":"This morning my family and I were looking for a new place to have breakfast, so I turned in I yelp. I came across Sunnys and we thought we'd give it a try. We were definitely NOT disappointed! We were sat right away and the hostess took our drink order right away, and was back almost instantly. I didn't ask, so the orange juice might be normal orange just, but it tasted better than most. My daughter basically inhaled the Jr. French toast and loved it! Everyone really enjoyed their food, and we'll absolutely go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Chocolate milk. On. Point.  I had Casey as my waiter and he was amazing. So Friendly and funny. I ordered the banana nut French toast it was delicious. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A legit taste of the East Coast right here in Tempe.  Excellent pricing, excellent food, and the best value for the money anywhere.  Come early and take advantage of the ridiculous breakfast deals.  This place is as good as it gets....literally."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. Highly recommend the skillets. Best part? They do bacon right."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with some coworker's a few times. One time we were asked to wait to be seated until the majority of our party was there, another time we were seated right away. Both times there were multiple seats open so not sure if that's a restaurant policy or a specific person. But both times the service and food were better than average. I typically know what I want for breakfast and order just that rather than off a menu even if I have to order ala carte. Each time the waitress offered a similar option that added food and cost less. Not all places will do this but it's appreciated."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying it was $60 for four people (three of which ordered breakfast).  I went online to look at the menu and chose a sandwich that came with roast beef, green Chile and jalapenos only to find out that the \"menu online is way outdated and they know it\"....  So I ordered an Arizona Melt and asked if they could add green chile to it.  Oh sure they could.  Charged me $1.99 to add about a tablespoon of some crappy canned chopped green chile which just made the sandwich soggy and it fell apart all over the place.  I don't know how this place gets decent ratings, but I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Food was just like the picture and description of what I ordered! It was still pretty warm, good. If there's a section to leave instructions why leave a note \"IF YOUR NOT GOING TO READ IT!\" It's not just this place it's all of them!!! I also don't like when they expect to take all your money when I was expecting change! I was going to give him a bigger tip! He just walks away with all my cash! But I would definitely order here again! Eggs Benedict Californian! Hash browns very good!"}
{"text":"I got the French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. Although the French Toast was sufficiently fluffy, it was nothing special. Reasonable priced. Ok service. I think there are probably better choices for breakfast."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, casual dining, friendly wait staff, good food, and decent coffee. All I can really ask for."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good, there wasn't anything spectacular about the interior. Just your classic diner, which is totally fine."}
{"text":"Promised the handsome waiter I would leave a review. First, he was so cute with the big blue eyes, that I was tongue-tied for the first few minutes. That being said this place has the BEST coffee ever!!!! Locally roasted, they fresh grind every pot. So good. Plus there is someone going around refilling coffee constantly. Never have an empty cup.   Ordered the eggs Benedict. Not great. Good but not great. I have definitely had better sauce. Not nearly enough lemon. Home fries tasted like leftovers. All in all a decent meal at a decent price though. Staff is super outgoing."}
{"text":"As Tempe residents, this was mine and my son s first time here and it was refreshing to see such friendly faces from the staff! Genuine smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. Service and Prices are wonderful too. Great quality food. Highly recommend this local family owned restaurant. Support local!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff is friendly.  Simply a good medium sized diner. It doesnt have a big patron following and can get busy and noisy. That's just shows how well the place is doing."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow.... Fair warning. The server was trying but he was over booked. Food was excellent had the waffle and things and hash.  Hash was excellent , waffle was made just right and eggs prepared as ordered. Overall I would be back."}
{"text":"This is just a comfortable diner. Had a great breakfast, well prepared and lots of it. My coffee cup never went empty with the excellent service."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! Their French toast is my absolute favorite! And the have the tastiest hash browns! And they have amazing staff! I love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Its good.  It's simple.  It's exactly what you want when you want to east diner food.  Don't over think it and enjoy it."}
{"text":"This little mom and pop diner is one of best breakfasts ive had since moving to the valley. The make your own omelette option is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"For a starving college student, I'd eat at this place more often than anywhere else. Staff welcomed me like family. Portion size is filling for the price. Arizona melt with curly fries and short stack of French toast is my go to."}
{"text":"Decent for the price on the daily specials,  but not great a little on the greasy side.   The Bill arrived in an AMEX book, but they dont take AMEX."}
{"text":"Good home style breakfast and not expensive. We weren't disappointed. Friendly servers too."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUNNY'S DINER!! Great spot to find right near campus! Excellent food, great service, and good atmosphere. I love that I can walk in at 9 am and order spaghetti, which is awesome by the way!! The Eggs Benedict that they have on Sundays, is killer and the Clam Chowder on Fridays is probably some of the best I have ever had!! I am a frequent customer to Sunny's Diner and it is definitely one of, if not the best, breakfast joint in the East Valley!!  Keep it up guys!!   Aimee.. Sunny's is not a steak house, it is a diner... if you want rib eye try going to a steak house.."}
{"text":"Service and food was great the first time I came here. It was completely the opposite my second and last time."}
{"text":"Today 9/3/17 me my wife and elderly mother were looking for a late small breakfast. When we saw Sunny's we were happy ,because we are not familiar with Tempe. As Soon as we pulled in approximately 239pm , I was helping my mother out of the car,when I saw a waitress make a mad dash to flip the close sign. There were people still inside. I'm sure she saw us pull in and didn't want to be bothered. What she doesn't know is ,I'm a Phoenix UPS employee who was told by a Tempe  UPS employee ( that's right around the corner and gives them much business)this was a cool place to bring clients, family and so forth. A very Bad experience before I even tried the food...that said a lot for me...oh BTW I called and they close at 3 pm...no customer service."}
{"text":"Finally a real quality diner in Tempe.  This place reminds me of back east diners and has very good price points.  Huge fan of the vegetable skillet and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Best food, best service, always been my favorite brunch place in Tempe. They're omelettes are GREAT you will always feel so satisfied, same with their breakfast scrambles and the waitresses are always also super helpful ."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. It's super cheap, and the food is good. We love coming here for breakfast. Service is always good, and the owner recognizes us and is always very friendly. It's family owned and operated, which I like better than big chains. They try to keep as much fresh ingredients on hand as possible, and their homemade salsa is great. We visit a couple times a month, sometimes more. I recommend them to everyone I know! You can't beat $3.99 for the breakfast special!"}
{"text":"This is true diner food was good not great, service is good very attentive. And they serve all kinds of a kind of food, breakfast lunch and dinner portions were average.  I would say this is a very average diner.  Free wi-fi made everything good."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food wasn't amazing and I wasn't impressed, I might just have gotten the wrong thing though so maybe i'll give it another try!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to delete posts so I just edit it and deleted my previous comment which was for a different establishment. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Ok is there a 6 star option?? Memorial day, sat right away by a very courteous hostess who immediately cleaned our table ans seated us, orders taken promptly and food was absolutely delicious! Our waitress megan was friendly and promt! Will be returning! Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"I take people here on purpose. Is there a higher compliment for a restaurant?  Look, it's basic food. Nothing fancy. There's no pretense in this food, but no shortcuts either. It's made with care, top shelf ingredients, and they don't settle for \"okay\". Every meal is better than the last.   Either I'm going toes up or they are before I stop eating here."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot, but it is not just for breakfast. Josh had a Gyro sandwich today and it was delicious. I've found the French Toast and things to be my favorite. Biscuits and gravy is decent - but I am biased and like to make my own at home. If Casey is your server, I can guarantee that he will treat you well!  Great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great service, cheap food and big portions. I'm a Jersey girl I and the breakfasts here are just as amazing as they are back home. Had the chicken fajitas and scrambled egg skillet with a tortilla instead of toast! Sooooo good. My only complaint is that this place closes way too early. They are near ASU and would make a killing during late night service."}
{"text":"Ok we travel a lot to college towns to see my child play.  We depend on yelp a lot to find good local places to eat.  We visited Sunnys this morning because all of the GREAT reviews I have to say was a little disappointed.  This place is old and has the looks of a grease diner.  I ordered the chile verde breakfast and there was no chile verde in the entire dish.  I asked were was the chile verde she said its in the scrambled eggs no where to be found I asked if I could have a small side if the green sauce and she said I have to charge you!!! The pan cakes were small and flat the French toast was nothing special.  I would not go back"}
{"text":"Great coffee, good staff, and biscuits the size of my whole hand.  I had the country breakfast and would definitely come back for it again.  My daughter had the kids French toast and granted she didn't eat to much enjoyed what she did.  Also very pleased with how we could substitute a fruit cup for meat with her meal as well.  Thanks for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood about a decade, and gave this place a pass every time I drove by. Finally, about 3 years ago, I decided to give it a go. I've been coming back ever since. It's a classic Greek-owned American diner with a ton of options, including Greek food. I've never been disappointed by anything I've tried. Sweet, savory, and gyros. Always delicious. The service is fantastic as well. The servers are nice, attentive, and helpful. All-in-all, it's become one of my favorite breakfast places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Amazing skillets, awesome staff. It was a pretty busy Sunday but we got sat in five minutes and the food came out fast. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Omg  I'm falling out of my swivel barstool! The food is awesome the coffee is perfect and the staff..pfft impeccable service! Oh Jennifer was a delight she even asked me to poke my egg and make sure it was poached soft..kudos guys we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I got some Orange Juice ( 1 glass) to drink, For food I had some French toast (3 slices), 2 eggs, and some bacon. It was very good and really hit the spot for a single guy who rarely buys bread. However, this place is not exactly cheap. My meal came to $11. The advertised $3.99 Breakfast is like half an egg or something. Nevertheless, it was basically worth it and I would go here again. It would probably get 5 stars if it were a little bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the Country Breakfast.   Large fluffy biscuits, tasty sausage and gravy with eggs cooked to order.  Kayla took good care of me and keep my coffee cup full and hot."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. It was pretty busy. Considering how busy they were, I think our service was outstanding. I don't know if the tortillas are made fresh there, but they seemed like homemade tortillas. Very, very good. The food was pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend Sunny's!"}
{"text":"Killer east coast diner food  Awesome waiter  Great place"}
{"text":"This is one of those great down-to-earth places I enjoy coming back to over and over. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. It's a great family restaurant when we have the kids with us. The owner is as nice as can be. The service has always been good. I love their soups. I think I've only had breakfast here a couple times but they were great. I've had a variety of lunch and dinner items from the menu and everything has been extra good. Their Greek meatloaf is especially good and very unique. Their prices are extremely reasonable so when I am with a larger group it is still affordable. They even have a senior menu along with the kids menu. I can't think of a single bad thing to say unless it might be to complain that they aren't closer to me so I can come here more often. I keep telling the guy he needs to open up a location in Chandler! And I sometimes wish he was open later in the day because I'm a late starter and by the time I'm in the area it is too often after they have closed."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before going to Big Surf Waterpark. Was delicious! Huge portions for cheap and quick service."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast.  We come here because we love the server Noelle. She is so nice and always remembers who we are and what is going on in our lives. Rapport building is so important in the customer service industry. The owner should be proud to have a team member like her!"}
{"text":"Don't write many reviews, but I have to give credit when credit is due!!  I was greeted first thing when I cam e in and when I left (I felt special - even though they do this to everyone).  The Food was Plentiful and Fantastic.  The fresh quick service was awesome.  I highly recommend this place for Breakfast or Lunch (huevos rancheros is GREAT, Chicken Caesar was fresh and tasty).  Great food!!"}
{"text":"I am something of a Sunny's regular at this point so I figured it was overdue that I write a review. Sunny's knows what it is, and it excels at being just that: a friendly, coffee-rich diner that treats you like a regular even if you're not, and treats you like a friend when you are. The staff prides itself on bringing you coffee. I've had, on multiple occasions, two staff ask me if I needed my coffee topped off within the span of fifteen seconds. Really, this is a great haunt of mine! My friends recently set up my 25th birthday celebration here and the staff all got into it. They let my buddies make a reservation with balloons and candles and etcetera. Sunny's doesn't take reservations. They did for me, though! And that's why I love them. They are pragmatic and don't let silly red-tape get in the way. Hell, they apologize if there IS a wait. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This is my 2nd time here and like my first visit, I was satisfied. They have a great menu and the staff is very friendly. The also offer many healthy choices as well. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. The portions are perfect and well worth the price. You'll leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"If you like diners and are on the neighborhood this is worth a stop. They have some unique items like gyro meat and eggs. The fruit instead of home fries upgrade is worth it. Friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"Everything from start to finish was perfect here today. I was greeted and seated immediately and was brought drinks in under a minute. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly, my server Noelle was excellent and checked on me multiple times. The food was excellent as well (try their omelletes!). I had to talk to the manager Alex afterwards to express my gratitude  for the perfect dining experience. Even the prices were great! Couldn't have had a better experience, seriously people try them out! I will be back many times as a customer!"}
{"text":"I always judge a diner by their biscuits and gravy and Sunny's Diner has amazing biscuits and gravy.  Oh, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast joint on Mcklintock and University.  Real easy to find.  The rest of thestrip mall is suspect, liquor store and all... I went several times this week while in town and had the 2 eggs, Ham, hash browns, and sourdough toast. The hash browns were burt a couple of times, but the rest was great.  The Ham was very large.   The staff is really great.  The timing of checking on us was perfect.  They were able to anticipate our needs and were very helpful.   Always check on the specials.  My wife had a great skillet in the first day and had to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. However, the hostess yelled at us from across the restaurant to come and be seated instead of walking over to greet us properly (irritating). Then the person who served us our food was behibd the counter coughing up a lung. Then when she couldn't contain herself she dipped into the kitchen to finish her coughing spell instead of going to the bathroom (this was right before she brought our food out). When she arrived to our table her face was all red and she was clearly ill. I understand being sick, but in food service handling peoples meals while sick is a no no! We were not happy campers.... management shoukd know better. She could have carried out other duties or just gone home."}
{"text":"I love coming here, food is great, but my favorite was clam chowder Friday's. Unfortunately, last week they decided to discontinue all the soups they make, which means no more clam chowder Friday's. I'm really bummed as this is the main reason I return.....why Alex?!?!?"}
{"text":"Really solid diner. Really good breakfast basics like chicken fried steaks but the omlettes and scrambles looked special. Terrific lunch sandwich selection as well with above average onion rings. Enjoyed both meals during the week a lot.   1/19/18 update. Still excellent breakfast. Huge chorizo scramble. Very attentive service. Very enjoyable  2/24 update: fairly busy Saturday morning but service fast and accurate. Chicano Benedict with house-made chorizo was fantastic."}
{"text":"First time here. We had heard about the great prices for the amount of food that you get. For both of us we had French toast with two eggs and two pieces of bacon, and biscuits and gravy with two eggs and two pieces of sausage and our total was about $16... Not bad.   Overall the food was pretty good.... Nothing spectacular. The French toast was definitely the best of the bunch.   My biggest hold up for this place was the service. It was pretty bad. We were seated by one of the bus boys and I wish he could have been our server, he was on point. He ended up taking out drink order and said our server would be there shortly... After waiting close to 10 minutes we had to ask for our server to come take our order. After taking it he had to come back twice to confirm our order... I mean I would rather that than him just guess but it's not like our order was anything complicated. Once our food arrived he never came back to refill our drinks or check on how the food was. I think he meant well but just wasn't prepared to handle more than a couple tables.  Overall we were less than thrilled with Sunny's. I suppose it's a good place for some hangover breakfast and we noticed that they have significantly cheaper prices Monday-Friday."}
{"text":"This so called DINER is the worst eatery I have been to EVER been to. I bought a groupon for this place and WISHING I never did. This was my first and last time I go to a place that believes they can charge you extra for \"gyro sauce\" and say that my groupon wasn't covering the sauce even though the groupon states that I have an certain amount of value. The service was ridiculous as well. It took the waitress 15 mins to take our food order and the place was dead. She only came over to us because the owner told her too. My grandma right from the start ordered the extra sauce wasn't told it was going to cost her extra. She had to ask for the sauce 3 times before it arrived to the table and then told her it was going to cost us more money....I then got so infuriated  the owner came over and told my grandma to open her gyro to find the EXTRA SAUCE (if you have to go searching for EXTRA sauce... I guess it  wasn't much of extra sauce..) .. Then told me that that there is a separate charge that wasn't covered.. I told him we were leaving and not going to pay for the food that wasn't going to be covered under our groupon.(90% of our food wasn't eaten) He told me he was going to call the cops. Which he did and the cops pulled me  over half way home and came to the conclusion that this wasn't a criminal matter and he would have to sue me. Which is fine with me who tries to sue someone for food someone hasn't eaten and was mostly paid for anyways!! This place will be closed in a year..."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, had a groupon and they made our meal perfectly."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was just as good. The whole staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered 40 minutes ago and still waiting........ I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict which is made with corned beef hash and comes with home fries.  Also have my two kids with me and they are starving and now restless.  Update:  food finally arrived!  Average at best in flavor.  Undercooked and runny poached eggs.  Pineapple slice on Mickey Mouse pancakes was old and tangy in an expired way.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and it was great, food was excellent and the home fries to die for. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have gone here twice and both times it has been great! The food is made fresh and with great ingredients. The menu has a large selection of both breakfast and lunch dishes. The service has been great and the staff is friendly! We will certainly be coming here more often!!!"}
{"text":"Finally! A diner whose prices, portions and food rival the diners found in my hometown jn MI. This is exactly what I want when I'm looking for an affordable hot breakfast served by friendly staff. Portions were huge, prices were great and staff was friendly.. What more could a Midwest girl want?"}
{"text":"Food was good and waitress was friendly but we waited almost an hour for our food. And to top it off the parking lot was so crowded our car got towed. Won't be back again"}
{"text":"If you want to eat some good breakfast without paying a lot of money, this would be the place. The food is GOOD and for the price, it is well worth it. I just wished I knew about this place a long time ago as I would have saved a lot of money. They have great breakfast specials and the service is GREAT! I would highly recommend this place to everyone especially college students!"}
{"text":"Wow, I wish I lived closer.  Rebecca met us at dark thirty in the morning with a big smile.   The specials are priced right.     We asked her what she recommended, her first was waffles or pancakes.   Check, pancakes ordered.   Next the choriso (they make it in house), yummy.   The price is right and a great value.   Weekday specials are $1 better than weekends but you won't be disappointed either way.    This is a must visit.   Don't let the limited # of reviews factor in your decision."}
{"text":"Multiple meals here. Not always open so pay attention to their hours. Closest thing to NJ Diners I have seen, other than Chompies. Lots of choices, Greek specialties, really well run and chock full of college kids most times. They have a breakfast special I have enjoyed. Coffee is good. No complaints. None."}
{"text":"I just move to the area, and this was my first time here. Was expecting a greasy spoon place, but it was much better than that. Looks like they've just remodelled.  The place was spotless and had a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. Most of the breakfast combos run just under 10 bucks.  Cholula, Tapatio and Tabasco on every table--my kind of place. My omelette came with fresh mushrooms, not canned, which made me very happy. It was cooked perfectly, and the home fries were yummy.   Just two very minor things. My pancakes were a little tough, but still delicious. And the utensils were very thin. I felt like I was using a camping fork. But like I said, very minor.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a try for breakfast."}
{"text":"Our usual waitress andrea is amazing very sweet and attentive the food excellent  big portions and great prices"}
{"text":"Worst customer service in the world. Manager (Martian) was extremely disrespectful. I ordered off post mates over half of my order was incorrect/missing. I will never ever eat here again I'd rather eat at McDonalds that eat at this place."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The affordable diner I used to love is gone.  Prices were raised and it's not really worth it.  In our party of 5 everyone thought their meal was lack luster and not worth it.  Both my friend and I had the 3 egg Huevos Rancheros with green chili beef (sounded promising).  My friend complained about the small portion of eggs insisting he got 2 eggs.. most of the plate was potato, beans and garnish.  The chili wasn't anything special, the beef was dry and sparse, no cheese.  If having diner food, I would expect diner prices.  There were Very few $6 options and half of the lighter options were kids meals.  On average, meals were $10 - $12."}
{"text":"Today's special was delicious!!! Roast beef scramble! I've had it for lunch and dinner now too. Enough for a whole day's worth of food!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Went here this morning expecting a good diner breakfast with the girlfriend and was very disappointed. Horrible service and took over 20 minutes to take our order which is unacceptable when there was only two other people in the diner."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on a weekday! Parking was good and easy. The ambiance was really nice. Had a classic diner feel to it. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. The service was exceptional. I got the Bubba Gump omelet, which tasted very good. I enjoyed the variety on the menu and there were some new/unusual menu items that I look forward to trying in the future. There is a 10% discount for ASU students as well, which was nice. I would definitely recommend this place to someone and will return again!"}
{"text":"I always drive by sunnys and this morning I stopped in and had a great time. Casey Is very welcoming and and an amazing server! Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"The food isn't amazing, but it's not bad either. It's just your average breakfast joint. I live really close to this place, so it is a great place to just ride your bike to. We have never had an issue with the service, they are usually on top of everything."}
{"text":"Super great food. I ordered banana nut French toast and my gf had the tex mex! Everything was cooked great. Potatoes were peppery and salsa was just the right amount of spicy. We loved it!!"}
{"text":"Today we went to Sunny's for a late (2pm) lunch and we really disappointed.  Two of us ordered a gyro and one a sandwich.   We should have ordered the sandwich.  This was the worst gyro we've ever had and from a restaurant owned by someone named Papamatheakis I would have expected much much better.  The pita was toasted so was hard instead of soft and chewy and the meat was tough and dried out.  Neither of us finished our meal. The three tiny pieces of tomato were a joke. There were no or few customers in the place so it wasn't a case of being there at a busy time.  I will not go back.  We did get a portion off our bill but it's to little too late.  I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was in town for an event last year and this year. Came here both times and it was amazing. This year I had the specialty pancakes with fruit, nuts and whipped cream. So good. Boyfriend got the Mediterranean omelette and he loved it. The home fries were great as well. Crispy on the outside, soft center, perfectly seasoned.  And the coffee is especially good. Really hit the spot.  Rachel was so nice. There was a large group seated ahead of us and she got our orders in first so we wouldn't have a long wait.  All in all, a great place"}
{"text":"I had great service here.  I ordered an omelet that was just OK, and the home fries were super dry, and had no flavor at all. Not much else to say.  Perhaps the skillets are their specialty. I dunno, sometimes I'm dry and bland also I guess,"}
{"text":"I've passed this place so much and never stopped by to try it out, this past Saturday my daughter had a softball game in Tempe and we wanted brunch and yelped help us decided. I had the Country breakfast everything was real good, the Mrs. liked her meal so much she couldn't finish it. My daughter on the other hand chose spaghetti for some reason, it looked good when our waitress brought it over but it was heavy on the herbs and seasoning. spaghetti and sauce was cooked well it was just over seasoned. My daughter ate a good amount but didn't finish. all in all atmosphere was good, our waitress was helpful and we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"This place pleasantly surprised me! It reminds me of a spot from my hometown and has a greek style menu. My mom had the gyro burger and i got a bite.  It was so good! I had the patty melt and it was very good.  I wish they would serve a cup of soup with the meal like other diners do but the portion of fries is enough to fill you up.  Prices are $8-$9 a person. Service coulda been faster but it was worth the slow waiter"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast diner. We had scrambled eggs, omelette, fried potatoes, toast and english muffin. Outside of the liquid butter/oil they put on their toast, breakfast was pretty good. Coffee is great!"}
{"text":"I have a football player's appetite on Saturday morning and I definitely came to the right place for breakfast. The atmosphere is pretty modest.... but the portions are not. I got \"The Piglet Skillet\", which could best described as an entire farm in a bowl. I got it with a side of sour dough toast and some extra bacon. I'm very satisfied.   The only criticism is that we had to wait a while to put in an order. Understandable on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Good ol' homey diner. Nothing really to make it stand out from others, except maybe the service. The waitresses were super friendly and attentive. It gets the extra star for that. Otherwise the food itself was basic, but tastey enough."}
{"text":"I have to vote meh. Nothing about Sunny's Dinner stood out. Everything was good enough, but not enough to be memorable. Everything was clean, but it wasn't old enough to be retro or new enough to be cool. I would go there again, but more because I needed a restaurant in that part of town & it would take time to find some place else."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go out for breakfast quite often, and we're not hard to get along with. We live close by and decided to try out the little diner down the road. BIG MISTAKE AND WASTE OF MONEY. He had two eggs and \"homemade\" biscuits and gravy. The biscuits tasted like they were out of a box, gluey and not flakey at all. The gravely was floury and tasteless. I had the huevos rancheros, overall okay but my eggs were way too runny for medium and the home fries were like little rocks. Our server was rude and took forever to bring water, instead talking to the other waitresses and hanging out by the kitchen. Our bill was $29, way too pricey for what we considered to be a pretty disappointing meal. We left a 10% tip and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot instead of our typical Sunday at Chompie's and we left disappointed. We sat at the counter since that was the only thing available and it was pretty cramped but comfortable seats. I got the Denver omelette, no cheese with fruit and whole wheat toast. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet. The service was relatively slow but it was a busy Sunday so that's understandable.   The food came and unfortunately I was served hash browns instead of the fruit I ordered, but the waitress dropped the food off so quickly I wasn't able to correct it. Our waitress was no where to be seen for at least 10 minutes so I just decided to suck it up. The hash browns were awful, not crispy whatsoever and absolutely zero seasoning. Not worth eating in my opinion. The omelette, despite having no cheese was the greasiest omelette I've ever eaten. After I managed to take a few bites I mentioned to my boyfriend that it feels like I'm eating a greasy cheeseburger instead of eggs, it was that bad. His skillet was decent, but he wouldn't get it again. He did say the coffee was decent.   Another small thing that also bothered me was that the toast came already buttered. I know that can be standard diner protocol, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time or have to option to have plain toast.   In short, stick with Chompie's, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"nice little greek style diner great for breakfast ive havent ordered lunches but all the breakfasts ive tried have been excellent always had fast service and they check up on you"}
{"text":"Two things make me happy- veggies and cheese. My omelet arrived with loads of both! Really flavorful, fresh tasting and delicious. Fast service, kind waitresses and hostess! I can't believe I didn't come here sooner. You can get a full plate breakfast for under 5 bucks! Can't beat that! Really calm environment as well, perfect for the start to my day! Thanks, Sunny's!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this diner the morning and wasn't really impressed. We were seated quickly and drink orders were taken and arrived promptly. Ordered a Greek omelet and biscuits and gravy.  The omelet was well put together with a side of home fries and  toast. The biscuits and gravy on the other hard were not all that great. It's all most like the kitchen staff had dumped an entire bottle of pepper into the gravy mix making it inedible.  This coupled with the fact our waiter never returned once to fill our glasses made this for less then an average dining experience. And I all honesty, it wasn't busy, it was mid morning on a Monday. Really no excuse for such.   Probably wouldn't return here to dine in, maybe for a to go order."}
{"text":"We were craving breakfast over the weekend, and faced with the decision of going to Denny's (Closer by), or Sunny's Diner, we wanted to support locally owned businesses. Plus, the food's way better!  Since my last review the menu's changed a little, but the quality and quantity of food you get is still consistently good. I ordered the special for the day- the meatloaf breakfast. At around $10, it was an large helping of sliced meatloaf covered in gravy, 3 eggs, with your choice of toast/biscuit and hash browns.  The meatloaf was dense and packed with flavor. The hash browns, as always, were excellent, cooked on the griddle perfectly. I opted for a biscuit, which was a large fist-sized portion, light and fluffy tasting. It was so much food I could only finish about half.  Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.   Overall, still a great place to dine!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and this place is right down the road. The food is great and there are a lot of options but the service is slow even when there are just a few tables in the restaraunt. If you have some extra time to spend in the morning, I would highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago for spring training and saw the sign promoting Sunny's Diner. My friends and I were really happy with our breakfast here! The coffee was so good (and we found out locally roasted), and the skillets were delicious. Wait staff were very personable. Great place!"}
{"text":"A basic diner with a super-friendly staff. The food was better than I expected and due to the low price specials it does draw a large older crowd. The whole thing just felt authentic and as someone else noted, nice to have an independent business in the area. I'm not a huge fan of diners in general but this was a good one and worth a Sunday breakfast with my parental units."}
{"text":"Love grabbing breakfast here. They also serve spaghetti all day, after years of people demanding spaghetti for breakfast, I can only assume."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this morning and was not disappointed in the least. This is no fancy place but it has the earmarks of a good old-fashioned home town diner. You are greated at the door by a large banner that touts \"spaghetti served all day!\" I can honestly say that I considered having it for breakfast just because it was an option! The staff was smiling, friendly, and helpful from the hostess to the servers. The menu is huge with one page devoted solely to omelettes as well as standard fare and sweet extravagances like banana chocolate chip pancakes. I chose the Bubba Gump omelette and my companion had the Pancho omelette. Normally he will eat his entire breakfast but this time he had to get a box as did I so the portions are great if you like to have leftovers. I will definitely go back to try other items and maybe that spaghetti for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love family owned businesses. The service here was great and my breakfast was just delicous. This could be our regular Monday morning stop"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I ordered the Tex-Mex and that wasn't very special. Thought it would work better in a different plating style. My friends ordered some good looking food though.   When I requested a table, there were already 5 parties ahead of me by around 10:10. My party was for 8 people. The restaurant let me know that it would be 10-15. I understand that it takes a long time to seat a group of 8 but why tell us a certain time and seat us 50 minutes later. Their reason for not seating us in time is because they forgot about us. Sometimes it happens.   I'd go back but will order something else. When I go back I plan on getting some pancakes or something else other than the Tex-Mex.   It's a very casual place. Dennys has better decorations and seating. The price is about the same as Dennys but I feel you get better flavored food and service and quality of food for price at Sunnys Diner. If ever in Tempe if eat breakfast at Sunny Dinner.   Thanks for the good time!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch had chicken fried steak it he food was good service was good I'm giving them 3 stars because the bathroom was not very clean"}
{"text":"Love Sunny's! This restaurant has great food as well as great service! There menu you has a great selection of food allowing you to pick several different options. I typically get the Greek skillet as that is my Favorite! The thing I like most about here is the consistency with service and food."}
{"text":"First time at sunnys food was good service was Great Andrew our server was awesome will definetly be back"}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff reasonable price, best chicken fried steak I've ever had"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. My daughter is allergic to soy and she asked if they would cook her omelette without using an oil containing soy. They refused and the waitress said \"absolutely not. Waitress had an attitude and would not even discuss the situation.  Every other restaurant we go to helps us in this regard. Not this place. They would not help us, got snotty about it, so we left. We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I used to really like to eat at Sunny's Diner. The food is above average. I've been going there for a few years off and on. I'm just a bit perturbed by my last visit (that was cut short). They were pretty busy, which is usual for them, so i sat at the breakfast counter. I don't usually do this but i had just gotten coffee at a 'major coffee shop' when i decided i was hungry, so i stopped at Sunny's. When i sat at the counter i noticed the girl scowled a bit when she brought me a menu, i told her i had coffee but I'd like some water. As i looked at the menu apparently that server tagged another server to come and serve justice on me. She curtly barked at me \"I'm sorry but we don't allow outside drinks here!\" No 'hello' or anything... Not realizing i had two servers but quickly realizing that I'd been double-teamed i quietly said \"i guess I'll go eat some place else then.\" Come on Sunny's your food is good but not that good...and your coffee is definitely not up to par as other coffee places. And your servers well, they definitely need to be trained better in customer service, or replaced."}
{"text":"Picked up breakfast on way to office. Called ahead and the girl was helpful. Pick up was easy and the girls were very nice. Inside looked like a typical local old diner. Food was good. Never was good eating it out of styrofoam and I had no salt or pepper or any sauce. It was still good and went down fast. Quantity was decent for price. I got the simple eggs bacon and potatoes meal for $3.99. Came with toast also but had them hold that. I would go back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  These guys have a huevos rancheros that is absolutely one of my favorite restaurant breakfast dishes around here--it's just REALLY tasty!  I have gone to other restaurants and had similar dishes, but found myself saying, \"It was good, but it wasn't as good as Sunny's\".  I wish that I could give a more comprehensive review with my opinion on a selection of items, but I enjoy these eggs too much to have ordered much of anything else here. . .  One thing that I have had other than the huevos is their pasta with the homemade tomato-meat sauce--that was primo.  The only issue that I had with it was that the serving was much too small.  If you want a plate of great pasta, get a double order, stuff that napkin into your shirt and go to town."}
{"text":"Good diner -- Good food, friendly quick service, and reasonable prices, but the place sits in a trashed and dirty strip center.   Don't buy the Groupon deal expecting to find \"Up to $32 for $16,\" or whatever the specifics are.  The only thing on the menu that would take two meals to $32 is the Ribeye steak, which they no longer carry.  In fact, forget the entire dinner menu because they are only open for a couple of hours on Friday evening and that's for a fish fry.   If you both order the chicken fried steak or sirloin steak and eggs breakfast, you'll make a couple of bucks on the coupon, but for anything else it's probably a better deal to just pay menu and not worry about an expiration."}
{"text":"Sunny's Diner is absolutely delicious! I live next to Harlow's Cafe, which is usually my go-to choice for Sunday breakfast. However, we were leaving Tempe Marketplace when we decided to stop into Sunny's for breakfast. The place was busy as expected (9:45am on a Sunday) and we got seated right away. Not only was the service fast, the Eggs Benedict and Home Fries were excellent as well! We we're in and out in honestly 30 minutes. Sunny's is a hidden gem that I'll gladly drive 4 minutes out of the way to eat at every Sunday."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here. No wait, service was fast & friendly. Food was hot & delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sunnys and it will most definitely be the last. Food was okay to say the least and the service was terrible. Drink order was taken before we could even sit at the table to look at the menu. Very informal. Server brought check over after setting down food and I still had to ask her as she was walking away to refill drinks that had long been empty. Portions of food not worth the price."}
{"text":"This is a really great place for breakfast, especially for the price! Their omelets are decent and they give huge portions! I had the Irish/corned beef omelet and the banana/walnut pancakes and they were great!"}
{"text":"Friend mentioned this place on FB & since I drive past there frequently I decided to give it a try.  I would love to give it more stars because the wait staff was wonderful, friendly, fast & kept our drinks filled.  Unfortunately, a fight including \"F-Bombs\" in the kitchen with the accompanying sounds of things being thrown as apparently some poor staff person was being verbally assaulted made us very uncomfortable.  Then my \"hand-breaded\" chicken fried steak arrived, looked just like the frozen ones at Costco, tasted like the same brand Village Inn/Denny's/I-HOP use. The home fries were dry & inedible as were the biscuits.  Coffee was good, so was the sausage gravy, but next time I want breakfast out I will head south to Chase's Diner."}
{"text":"My friends took me there the first time, and then I went there several times. One of my favorite brunch choices. They have the best signature French toast!!!!!! I ordered it every time, totally I'm a big fan of it."}
{"text":"The service was very slow for the amount of people they had. The carpet is dirty and smells. The food wasn't bad and is cheap. I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Sunny diner is not accommodating for the larger person they had a family table open and refused to pull them apart to seat us they sat everyone that came in after us. So we left"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with the service and my meal. I ordered a California burger and was served an American Classic burger. When I informed the waitress after several attempts of flagging her down, she took the plate back. I would expect a diner to correct my order but she came back with the same plate of food, just a few fresh slices of avocado thrown in, seriously?!?  Other than that, my family completed their meals before me and their plates looked delic."}
{"text":"Well our first time here.  I am not all that impressed.  We ordered the banana pecan pancakes and they do not look anything like the picture and they were pretty tasteless including the\"maple syrup\" They were very kind to take them off The ticket.  The rest of my food was ok. My husband had the corned beef skillet and said it was really good.  Our server was very nice with smiles customer service is very important to us."}
{"text":"I think this place might make it. After the many restaurants that have tried this corner over the years Sunny's as a cheap breakfast spot might work. I'd suggest they pare down the non-breakfast menu and stick to a few solid eggy choices. The $2.99 breakfast that lured me in was well worth the normal $4.99 price. They do need to work on getting orders up a little quicker (which a simpler menu would help with)."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best breakfast diner. The service is amazing the food is even better.  They're mexican dishes are actually authentic and spicy truly is spicy. As a Hispanic that's pretty hard to come across.  The pancakes are divine and fluffy and some pancakes usually give me a bad after taste but these are perfect as well as their butter and syrup! Everything about this diner is delightful. Great ambience great food!"}
{"text":"Great place to read the Sunday paper and a tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"Solidly okay.   My Irish omelet had a large portion of from-the-can hash, and the eggs were well prepared. The home fries had enough salt and pepper that they sang \"Push It\" on my plate. The sourdough toast was good.   Also at the table was a California Benedict. It was reported as 'okay.'  Prices are steep. Probably too steep for the food quality."}
{"text":"I've been eating here several times a week for the last couple of months, and have yet to have a bad dining experience!  Jessica is usually my server and she always has a smile and bright personality, and I usually have my food within 10 minutes of walking in.  The atmosphere is pleasant, it's nicer than the grease-shack diner you might expect in the campus area.  Very casual and open in design, the seats might not be luxury recliners but what do you expect.  Their breakfast specials are affordable ($2.99 for a typical diner 2-egg breakfast? Yes please!) and the food is tasty; perhaps nothing exceptional taste-wise but consistent excellence goes a long way in my book.  I'm fairly particular about my eggs and it's been difficult for me to find restaurants that won't occasionally either over- or under-cook my eggs.  When I'm not in the mood for breakfast, their chicken-fried steak hits the spot.  Frequently diners seem to over-season their gravy, particularly in the form of loading it up with pepper.  Sunny's doesn't, which I really appreciate; I think under-seasoning and letting the customer season to taste is a more practical approach for a diner, maybe it wouldn't fly for fine cuisine but that's not what we're here for, now is it.  There's a wide variety of menu options, from your standard diner omelettes, egg combos, sandwiches and steaks to several Greek and Italian options, and a good-sized array of salads and side orders.  Their sweet potato fries are fantastic!  Alex, the owner, is consistently approachable and friendly, I see him making a point to get to know all of his customers from the first minute they walk in the door, and he also works his tail off helping the other staff do their jobs, and I've seen him loading in supplies himself.  His family has been in the restaurant business in the valley for quite a few years, and the experience comes through in this diner.  They were responsible for Fast Eddie's, which had been my favourite Phoenix diner until I discovered this place.  I place a lot of value on good customer service and rapport, and their staff are always polite and engaging.  If you're looking for a clean, consistent diner with some menu variety and good prices, Sunny's is definitely a good choice.  Tell them Ben sent you!"}
{"text":"IM NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. I have never been to this place before and was there just now for a meeting. I was in a hurry and didn't have time to eat all of my food, so naturally I asked for a to go box and they gave me a small one at first when anyone can see I have a whole plate to take home, so then I asked for a bigger one to put my left overs in there and was in a hurry as I stated before out the door. I forgot my to go box and walked back in a few minutes later in a panic. The table was then cleared off and the food was gone..keep in mind I've been to a lot of restaurants and the times that I almost forgot my left overs the waitress has always been alert to what's going on and has always notified me that I'm forgetting my card or my food or my purse etc, however this was not the case this time. I spoke with who turned out to be the owner and he said that after reviewing the tape that they wouldn't make me a new meal because I was gone for over 15 minutes which was not true. I've been in customer service for over 6 years and whether you are in the wrong or not it's good to work with the customer so that are happy and will want to come back again. What I experienced her is a lack of professionalism at this place, from their service to their own owner! The food is good yes, but everything else has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I thought it was mediocre and really overpriced for what you get. Not much more to say than that. Next."}
{"text":"Great causal dinning! Casey is the best server! Clean and very good service. Would eat here several times a week!"}
{"text":"This review reflects only one visit to Sunny's.  It's the kind of breakfast joint I like. A bit of a dive, which is generally a compliment coming from me. Think of a Denny's that has seen better days. It's locally owned. The waitresses are friendly and keep coffee cups full. The demographic of the clientele seems nicely mixed, with some families, some students, some professionals, some not so professional.   So why only three stars? The food on this day could have been better (and I suspect it usually is). When I visit a breakfast spot for the first time I either go simple or order their specialty. This was a simple day. Pancakes, scrambled eggs & bacon. The bacon was perfect, served crisp as requested. The eggs, however, weren't well scrambled. Not a terribly big deal. The pancakes, however, were tough in consistency and had spent a little too much time on the grill. The flavor of char is great when you're talking hamburgers, but not so much when you're tasting pancakes. I'm anxious to give Sunny's another try, next time earlier in the day. I can see the potential."}
{"text":"I went to Sunny's Diner last Sunday to have a solo breakfast and read my book. It was quite busy which was a good sign. I've lived 2 miles down the street and drive past all the time but I never thought to go in. I was pretty satisfied with my visit. I got the waffle with the fresh strawberries and bananas with two scrambled eggs. It was quite good. I also got a tea but I didn't like being charged $2+ for a lipton tea. C'mon tea should have free refills like coffee or charge less for it. I'd go back and try something else but I won't get the tea."}
{"text":"Not impressed, dark & gloomy vibe and food was ok. The servers don't seem well kept and although they were nice, they didn't give that homey type feel & vibe you expect from a diner!"}
{"text":"It's always nice finding a great hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon. Sunny's is that and more! While the food was delicious (I had the chicken-fried steak) and affordable, that was not what compelled me to leave this review. Rather, it was their absolutely phenomenal service that was truly impressive. I recommend this place for those looking to have a nice, real diner experience."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant! They do a fantastic omelette here Also the eggs Benedict, and it's various incarnations is really great!  Nice people, a clean restaurant,an excellent place to dine!"}
{"text":"The food is so tasty, the service rocks--what a terrific vibe--and the value can't be beat in Tempe!  Well, as you already probably surmise,  I come to Sunny's a few times a week.  Today's meal was so good, I decided I just had to write another review.  As I often do, I picked a booth near the window so I could watch the foot and car traffic (Sunny's sits right at the SE Corner of University and McClintock).  My server, Jocelyn,  was so nice.  She didn't seem to mind that I was a table of one, she refilled my water several times without being asked, she got my order in quickly,  and my lunch was in front of me in less than 10 minutes.   I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs...WOW, it was delicious.   The meatballs had so much flavor, the meat just falls apart in your mouth,  and even though you only get two, they are so large you need no more.  The meat sause is generous, tangy, with enough spices to keep you interested til the very last bite.  This is a serious plate of spaghetti,  and you get two half slices of Texas toast with it.  At $5.99, there simply is no better meal in Tempe."}
{"text":"I was a bit dissatisfied with the quality of service and food. I've heard good things and wanted to try it out for myself. I got a standard breakfast... 2 eggs, 3 pancakes, 2 bacon, and some hash browns. The eggs were unseasoned as well as the potatoes. Just very bland and forgettable. The pancakes were like cardboard. I've never ever needed a knife to cut pancakes at any other restaurant.  It was a strange thing.  The bacon wasn't bad, but it's not the best I've ever had. So overall just a 'meh' experience."}
{"text":"I think Carolyn and Sabrina (the previous reviewers) were just having a bad day when they ate here... I don't think their reviews were fair.  Breakfast at SUNNY'S was awesome!  The service is top notch, I'm a vegetarian, and my waiter Marty upgraded my veggie omelet to feta and egg whites for under 2 bucks.  So, I recommend it to all my vegetarian friends out there who are having a hard time finding wholesome food to eat. Anyway, I got my coffee and water right away, My food was ready right away.  Seriously, I got my order  before I opened up my laptop.    The omelette was delicious, and so were the homefries, Marty kept the coffee comming, I enjoyed my meal very much! So, that's a 10. Thank You Sunny's"}
{"text":"So visiting some family in AZ we decide to go to get a late breakfast. I am strongly opposed to chain restaurants and wasting money. When my dad suggested going to Denny's I told him to get the fuck out of here and I then broke out my yelp app and searched nearby. Sunny's had good reviews and we made our way over. As a people I think we should support independent restaurants even if it costs a bit more than the swill served at I Hop. It worked out good because Sunny's was low key with great food at  prices that were lower than the chains. I ordered the gyro skillet and I left stuffed and satisfied. My dad got one of the $4.99 breakfast specials and was impressed as well.  Great value for the money.   Go to hell Denny's."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this place and it has become my go to. The food is so good! Everything I've ordered has been delicious, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"First off, I want to give the staff a shout out!  Awesome Service!  Was right there when we needed her. ha.  We were starvin looking for a place to munch some brunch. We saw a light, illuminated in my mind was Sunny's. It was bright and what a treat. The biscuits and gravy were in charge. A big portion, they were large. Rather than starve, hit up Sunny's to brighten up your morning.  A-OK on my meter..."}
{"text":"If you appreciate great service and friendly staff, Sunny's is for you. Your coffee cup is always full and they deliver your food hot from the kitchen.  On my last visit I had the Spinach Florentine. Scrambled eggs with spinach chunks of fresh bacon, not bacon bits, and cheese covered in a hollandaise sauce that actually tastes lemony. Their potatoes are home fries that are smashed on the grill and given that golden brown crust that I prefer.  So the staff and food is excellent. Give Sunny's a try and brighten up the rest of your day."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and very efficient, prices are great, the food is good, and the portions are big. The atmosphere is laid back, definitely worth a try! :)"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive, the food was great...once it actually arrived.   On to the restaurant  When we walked in the host immediately told us that they were on a wait with absolutely no line but multiple unclean tables.  It took our server a minute to come over but once he finally did, our order was taken. While we waited for our food for over an hour the server never stopped to fill our coffee, water or even to let us know what was going on. When I finally asked where our food was he said \"the kitchen is backed up but we're working on it.\"  The restaurant was less busy than when we first arrived.   As we waited other customers walked in, were seated around and received their food before us.  Once our food finally came out the server never came back to check on us.   The only reason that I'm giving this place 2 starts is because the food was good and the server did comp our bill.  However, the overall service in the restaurant leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"The place is a little rundown, but don't let that deter you. The food was fantastic (my wife and I had breakfast - she had bacon and eggs and I had a pork chop and eggs) and the staff was very friendly and right on top of their game.  Prices were very reasonable and the quality of the food was better than expected. This is what a family-run kind of business should be. I have no idea if this is a family-run business, but it has the feel of one the way the folks there seemed to care about what they were doing. We'll definitely be back.  Edited to add: We've been back there a few times now for breakfast and lunch (and dinner on Friday evenings) and I have to say we'll keep going there. The owner does everything from cooking to cleaning, serving to seating, and the staff will make things right if you don't think everything's as good as it should be. The place can get crowded from time to time and I'm happy it can since it deserves to be busy."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! I've been to the place twice now. Both times I ordered a rib eye and eggs, both times they were out. Why even have it on the menu?   I ordered a steak and eggs and it was not worth the $12 I paid for it. Thin and poor quality. Gross eggs, gross coffee gross everything.  The customer service is terrible. I walked out of here deciding to never come to this place again."}
{"text":"For some reason I have to type a lot of words for Yelp to accept my stars but ultimately it's a good place to eat."}
