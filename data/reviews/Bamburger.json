{"text":"Bamburger is the latest entry into the inexpensive \"gourmet burger\" trend taking over Yonge Street, including Gourmet Burger Co., South Street Burger Co., Burger Shoppe and Gourmet Burger.  While Bamburger offers a decent take-out menu, we chose to enjoy their small, but friendly sidewalk patio, right in the middle of restaurant row at Yonge and Davisville. Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.  Starting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.  The menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!  We went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.  Bamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.  If you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had burgers here tonight and were really disappointed. The burgers were tiny and dry. The onion rings were cafeteria style (frozen from a bag). The sweet potato fries tasted like they were McCain. The decor was nice but the low quality cafeteria food was embarrassing. There are so many better places nearby for real handmade burgers and fries. I would recommend gourmet burger to anyone looking for quality food."}
{"text":"Just catching up on my review and went here a few months ago but I do remember after leaving just saying \"meh\". The bun was stale and way too big for the burger."}
{"text":"Bamburger makes a good burger, pure and simple.  My office just moved to Yonge and Eglinton, and Bamburger is one of my favourite lunch spots: good service, a surprisingly upscale decor for a burger place, and, most importantly, good burgers. The patties are always juicy and well seasoned, the accompanying fries fresh, and the condiment selection dizzying. All of this awesomeness and reasonable prices makes Bamburger a major find."}
{"text":"I'll first note that I'm not a huge burger joint kind of person... I'm usually underwhelmed as burgers are something I can make well at home.  I ordered the Turkey burger to try something different.. it was huge and very juicy (I've had dry turkey burgers before). I love all of the sauce and topping options that are free.. other burger places I've gone to charge for those, so that's great. I had mine with the cranberry/apple sauce.  On the side I had sweet potato fries, very crispy and nice. My bf had the Bamburger and said it was great. I stole some fries off his plate and thought those were good aswell. The garlic mayo was awesome, used it to dip my fries in!   Our service was great.. overall awesome experience and I'm definitely going back to try the veggie burger and quite possibly the Birthday Cake Milkshake :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Friday night with a few friends.  Interior is quite nice and comfortable with booth seating.  I ordered a turkey burger with poutine and ended my meal with the ultimate dessert combo. The meat could have been juicier and the gravy could have been hotter but the dessert combo was the right amount of sweetness.  Overall, the prices are what I would expect for a full service burger joint."}
{"text":"Bamburger is my go to place when I'm craving a gourmet burger. This place is super comfortable with dim-lights, warm colored interior and has a woody cabin feel to it. The staff here are friendly and provide great service.  Bamburger offers soups, salads, sandwiches, poutine, desserts, beverages (including their delicious milkshakes) and of course- burgers! All their burgers are super fresh and charbroiled. You can get chuck beef burger (they have two sizes), chicken (they give you a whole juicy chicken breast), turkey, veggie, mushroom, and pork burger. The burgers are served with hot and fresh homemade fries and the portions are good. What I love about their beef here is that the meat is natural and cooked to perfection! Also, they use non-hydrogenated trans-fat free oil.  They have a variety of toppings you can choose from for your burgers. Some you pay for and others you don't. Earlier reviews for this establishment mentioned that they paid for particular toppings which they do not charge for anymore. I love their buttery mushrooms ($1), feta ($1.50) and spicy chipotle mayo for my bamburger. It's always fun creating your own burger masterpiece.  My favorites have to be: sweet potato fries with their bamburger, the juicy 6oz strip loin steak sandwich served on garlic French stick bread, and the ultimate dessert combo ($2.95)- mini sundae, apple betty and decedent brownie with a scoop of rich ice-cream.  Overall, Bamburger is a great comfortable place to go for fresh and delicious burgers, drinks and desserts for reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My girl and I went to Bamburger earlier tonight and had a great meal. We had debated going to Burger Cellar, Hero Burger but settled here and boy, was it the right call. Ambience is nicely done, kinda like an urban cottage and the music was satellite tunes and not generic like at other spots. Here is what we had:  -Mint-chocolate chip milkshake @ $3.95 (9/10) It is not thick and not watery which is nice and had actual small chocolate chips come through the straw which made for a great shake. -Double Bambamburger ($7.95 +$1.50 for goat cheese and $1.00 for sauteed onions). 9/10. With tzatziki, garlic mayo, (both free). Also came with fries. F'n fantastic. The onions were done in a way that appeared as if the chef focused entirely on creating my meal and came out perfect. The warm goat cheese was a burst of flavour that stuck to the roof of your mouth and would not let go and it made the world of difference. -Poutine ($3 extra on top of our fries : The fries were fresh - you could easily taste the difference. The cheese was nicely melted but not over melted so you could actually taste it while the gravy was in all honesty the best gravy I've ever had on fries. It was a bit thicker and had a great smoky flavour to it. - Sampler Desert $2.95: I can't believe they only charged 3 bucks for a plate that gave you a generous portion of apple brown betty, this warm brownie with a lil bowl of thick fudge and a mini sundae with fresh cream on top. I had to split it with my girl.  The Mrs. had the same thing except instead of the double pattie, she had a single patty and also left out the sauteed onions.  Total bill after taxes: $40. For everything we oredered it was worth it easily. It hit the spot just perfectly and if you happen to be around the Yonge and Eg region and want a solid win to eat at, definitely check it out. Value (9/10)"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Very good burgers but not outstanding when you take the BIG price into account. Again large portions but fries were just OK. For the price everything should be excellent. Bottom line: lose one star because high total cost. But, if you are looking for a good burger and are willing to overlook the premium - go for it."}
{"text":"There aren't too many places in the area with good food and a great atmosphere where you can take children.  My husband and I bring our toddler here for a quick, fresh and delicious dinner.    The menu is simple, with an array of additions to \"make it yours\".  The kids meals are complete and affordable.  The portion sizes are perfect, and the price is better than any sit-down restaurant within walking distance.  The atmosphere is modern, clean and comfortable, and the service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I don't go to a lot of Burger Places so I don't know how they all compare but Bamburger up at Yonge and Eglinton was so good I can still taste it and that was months ago! The qualtiy of the beef was superb and the choice of toppings were quiet gourmet and exciting.  The fries were crispy they w"}
{"text":"We were looking for a dinner place in the Yonge-Eglington area and bamburger came up as an option with a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately we were really disappointed with the quality of food here. The only good part of our experience here was the service. They had 5$ margarita specials which were crap. We ordered a bamburger with caramelized onions and cheese. The burger lacked flavor and was not worth the 13-14$ charge. We also ordered the club sandwich which was ok."}
{"text":"Having both consumed and reviewed 12 different burgers in the month of December, it goes without saying that I needed a bit of a break.  Still, a calling is a calling, so with this little ditty I welcome you to Decemburger and Beyond.  I met up with Sonya F on a lazy Sunday for a meal that was just a little too late to be considered brunch anymore.  Having lived a ten minute walk from Bamburger for as long as it's been open, I couldn't understand why I hadn't given it a try sooner.  Turns out I wasn't missing much.  On entry, I was immediately impressed with the neo-diner décor, with natural wood in abundance and slick-looking leather booth seating.  We were greeted by a friendly server who gave us the time we needed to figure out what we wanted.  Having received advance notice of the nickel-and-dime-you pricing ahead of time, I shan't complain much about it, but feel obliged to note that an $8 burger can turn into a $15 burger pretty quickly if you want a few toppings other than the complimentary lettuce, tomato and onion.  Ballpark mustard and good ol' ketchup are available tableside and plain mayo on request.  On principle, I took mine with the factory options only and slapped on a bit of mayo.  Now call me strange if you want, but I make a point of eating the tomato off of my burger before I dig in.  If the lettuce is good, I'll leave it on for an ironic nod at the ruffage I should probably be consuming instead of all this meat.  Bamburger's leafy green didn't make the cut - it was the limp, dark green kind that makes a better garnish (or pillow sham, for that matter) than burger topping.  This left me with a plain burger but for a small spread of mayo, allowing for maximal beef flavour delivery.  Sadly, delivery was a letdown.  While I knew by sight that I was eating beef, my mouth left me questioning my vision (!).  The patty was juicy and seemed very fresh, but the meat itself was weak and there wasn't even a hint of searing or charring to rescue it.  The whole wheat bun (I asked for white) didn't help, instead running a wheaty interference play on an already-scuttled Hamburger Hail Mary.  Since Sonya got the onion rings, I went for fries and e had the opportunity to try both.  The onion rings were decent, but won't make my (forthcoming) bet rings list.  The fries were delicious - thin, slightly crispy and likely made in-house - but the gravy was over-seasoned, over-thickened and seemed to contain some sort of dairy product.  On the plus side, the fries didn't need it, and there were plenty of onion rings for sharing.  All said, the two of us dined about a cheap as you can here, and paid $25, tax and tip in.  I'm not saying the place is bad, but for the money it's not good enough for me to go back when I've got other options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after passing it on the street umpteen times and was quite pleased.   Nice comfortable decor, comfy upscale seats (for a burger place) and really friendly staff.   The menu has pretty standard burger and sandwich offerings, with a plethora of additional toppings available (some at a cost). I really liked this place, and wish they'd expand their dinner offerings beyond burgerdom. Would definitely be back more frequently in such a case."}
{"text":"As a bit of a burger snob I'll admit I was rather skeptical when a friend recommended we try Bamburger.  Not bad at all. The burger was fresh and well seasoned, though there was quite a bit of filler (I could taste crispy breadcrumb). I had blue cheese and sauteed onion, which made for nice additions. The fries were pretty tasty, good and salty.   I  appreciate a place with so many drink options (non-alcoholic) and local beers on tap."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burgers. Honestly the best tasting that I've experienced. For a little extra money I got some extra toppings (sautéed onion & peppers) and it was worth it. I especially liked that their takeout bag is paper, instead of a styrofoam container.  Good quality & taste for a decent price. Not cheap/expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Pros: - Topping variety (the grilled pineapple and fried onions alone make this Australian very happy). - Decent range of drinks to wash the burger down (they have Stewart's pop which is quite nice, but I wish they had Boylans instead) - Nice atmosphere, and everything is well-kept and clean. - Staff are nice and helpful, and deal with a busy restaurant well.  Cons: - Price. It shouldn't cost me $15 (inc tax and tip) for a vegie burger and drink. It just shouldn't. Paying for toppings adds up. - Size of side is a bit stingy - my pile of fries was barely the size of my burger. - The burger is nice enough but it's nothing to rave about.  Put some sliced beets on that topping menu and I might reconsider the fourth star."}
{"text":"The decor at Bamburger is very nice, but the food is average, just as the previous reviewers have written. I had the \"Bamburger\" (beef burger) and didn't splurge on the gourmet toppings. Nothing wrong with it, but it was nothing special.  Gourmet Burger Co. Is a better choice in the Yonge/Eglinton area."}
{"text":"Lovely service. But what happened to the menu? Must've changed owners. So, so disappointing. Cheap ingredients, lousy tasting food. We have been eating here since it opened. Tonight we came in for a quick bite with the kids. Just so disappointing, we're gutted to say this will be our last visit."}
{"text":"The city these days is flooded with gourmet burger shops all competing I think for the same customers (considering the price's of each). While some of them hit the spot, others like Bamburger start to teeter off into burger oblivion.   I peddled past several burger joints on Yonge Street before deciding to take a chance with Bamburger. Well, turns out there is nothing BAM about Bamburger.   Ordered the turkey burger with extra toppings of brie and avocado. Well, there was no 'special' sauce covertly hiding beneath the patty ready to pounce my taste buds. There was no anything - except bun.  Though, it was topped with the basic tomatoes, onion and lettuce. Meeh. Borinnnng.    When I think gourmet - I think PIZAZZ, WAM, BAM, thank you, MAM!   Sadly, I recieved exactly the opposite from the turger i purchased. I am uncertain if I will be back to try the beef burgers....when there are just soo many other gourmet burger joints who have given me a better first imppression. I mean you can have pretty furnishings, good beers on tap - but when the food does not match the title....well, then what is the selling point?   Overall I rate this 2.75 stars for a good try (nice furninshings and good service)."}
{"text":"Have been passing by this place for a long time. So tonight was the night ! Came here for dinner with a friend.  It's not too big. I really like the 'chill' atmosphere here.  Service was fab.  The sauteed onions in salads and burgers are a definite plus.  Pricing is very reasonable.  The only downside is parking. On Friday night, be prepared to look around for places to park your car."}
{"text":"Are you like me and hate paying $8 for a pint and then $14 for a burger and fries? Bamburger offers a decent straight up burger in a sit down/pub environment and won't bust your bank (unless you're going with the extras as Chris notes). My lovely companion had the beef burger and I had the turkey burger. I found the turkey burger a bit dry but I think that's a problem with all non-beef burgers. There's just not enough fat in chicken or turkey to approximate the juiciness of a real beef patty.  Yeah service was fast and friendly.   Beer selection is really nothing to write home about. But if you're just looking for a non-nonsense place in your hood to grab a burger and a beer and not pay a lot, Bamburger is the logical choice."}
{"text":"I really like the burgers here!  It's a dimly lit pub-style restaurant inside, and I find the burgers (both regular and turkey) to be reliably tasty. Choose from a list of free toppings (pickles, hot peppers, etc), cheese selections (extra $) and additional toppings for extra $ (avocado, various mayos, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, etc)  I enjoy the fact that they offer onion rings as a burger topping ($1.50 extra) and the fries are great. Don't feel like indulging in fries with your burg? Sub them for the \"greens\" instead...the balsamic dressing it comes with is delicious!!"}
{"text":"These guys gave me a little shock and awe, but not in a way to give them 5 stars.    Shock: The bamburger is only $7.95 for a 1/3 lb hunk of meat Awe: It only comes with lettuce, onion, and tomato  Shock: It costs $1.25 for some garlic mayo Awe: They give you almost a quarter cup of the stuff  Shock: The onion rings are $4.25 Awe: They give you a paper bag full of them, enough to feed a small army.  The burger was juicy and the toppings made for an excellent experience but the costs quickly added up:  $1.25 for garlic mayo $1.75 for cheese $1.75 for sauteed onions $7.95 for the bamburger $4.25 for onion rings  The onion rings were nothing special.  They seemed to be just regular old frozen rings.  The decor is really nice with leather wrapped chairs and booths, carpeted flooring, and wood and brick walls.  The staff were friendly and quick with their service.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't really understand some of the complaints on here about Bamburger's pricing.   Yes, some of the toppings have extra charges but many of them are complimentary.  Unlike most of the other burger places in the area (South Street and Gourmet Burger Company come to mind) this one has table service and therefore is considered a little \"fancier\".  Beef, pork, turkey, or veggies burgers are all $7.95 and include french fries, or you can pay an extra $1 to substitute sweet potato fries, onion rings, salad, or soup.  (This is less than most places charge to substitute).  Sauces such as tzatziki, chipotle mayo, mango chutney, etc are complimentary and come as little dishes on the side, so that you can add as much or as little as you wish.  Today I went with a cranberry/apple sauce, to compliment my pork burger.  You can also add black olives, dill pickles, jalapenos and more at no charge.  (All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and red onions).  Cheese and bacon are an extra $1.50 each and certain toppings such as guacamole, sauteed onions or mushrooms are an extra $1.  You have your choice of a whole wheat or white bun.  They also have quite a few inexpensive desserts on the menu.  I like The Ultimate Combo which is only $3 and has a mini sundae, a mini apple brown betty, and a mini brownie heated with chocolate sauce and ice cream (the best of the three).  I do not think the prices of the meals are unreasonable at all - today was $35 including tax and tip for two people (both with the sides upgraded), a couple extra toppings, and two desserts.  We left very satisfied.  Bamburger's menu is fairly limited but they do have some salads as well as a club sandwich for those who choose not to go the burger route.  Not that you would want to do that."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at bamburger. The waitress was really great! Made honest conversation and a few jokes. The decor is nice and has a great atmosphere.The food is alright, it all depends on what type of burger you want. I had the regular beef burger and was not impressed."}
{"text":"It's not often that you find a burger joint with full sit-down table service.  That being said, their prices aren't too far above what you would pay at a fast food burger restaurant, however, at Bamburger the ambiance is much nicer.  I can only comment on the veggie burger here, but its delicious, and with the wide array of toppings (more than other places) you can change up your burger every time.  The fries here might be better than the burgers, though, being fresh cut - kind of like the ones that you can only find at fairs these days.  They also have really good mini desserts (or mini sampler) that takes care of that sweet after salty craving without making you feel the slightest bit gluttonous."}
{"text":"Great!  Not Burger's Priest, but really good.  Great addition to the area. Been a few times and always end up ordering the Bamburger.   Full range burger menu, with dogs and milkshakes.   Very decently priced for a gourmet burger joint.  The burgers are cooked on a grill and are fresh.  Lots of options are toppings.    Service is fun, servers are nice, varied seating options from tables to booths and half booths.   Definately high value joint that you can keep coming back to.  Who doesn't enjoy a good burger every now and then?  The portabello mushroom burger for vegeterians is effing massive. Two whole port mushrooms. Great!"}
{"text":"Great!! (meant to finish posting this years ago) Too bad they went out of business."}
{"text":"For $7.95 at Bamburger you can get a decent burger and fries with full wait service, I think it is a good value.  The inside is nicely decorated, the staffs are friendly. The atmosphere is kind of good enough for a cheap date (just make sure your date don't loaded up on the extra options!) + 0.5 star  The Bamburger basic I ordered was quite good made with real ground beef, not frozen patty. And it was charcoal grilled.. +0.5 star  You also get the choice of white or whole wheat bun, which is a nice touch. Not many burger places has that option or offering that without a surcharges.  It is also encouraging to see individual business instead of franchised business taking over the gourmet burger business.  They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Great burger, yummy poutine, excellent vanilla shake, very friendly and attentive service from a really nice server. Would definitely go back."}
