{"text":"This place rocks!  It's the only place I know of where I can get a lamb, pork, wild boar, venison, and ostrich burger!  It's good that we can kill more animals for and eat them because it makes vegans mad.  Plus the onion rings are really good.  My one complaint it that they should have ketchup and mustard bottles on the table, instead of packets."}
{"text":"The burgers are cooked from frozen patties, the fryer isn't always the right temperature (fries are sometimes overdone, or limp and oily), and the toppings are sometimes pretty sad. But Burger Inn still makes a big, satisfying burger."}
{"text":"This was a regular lunch-time destination when I worked at Southland Business Park. You can keep your Peter's Drive-In (which only takes cash and has no indoor seating). Places like this one, and Boogie's Burgers, are the best little hamburger places in town. Generous portions and for those so inclined, exotic menu items, make this place hard to beat. If one really wanted to complain, it might be about the off-brand ketchup, but a little variety is nice too. They don't serve it with an eye-dropper; the big burly dude behind the counter just puts both mitts into the box of packets, dumps a hundred of them on the counter, and says \"take what you need.\" Very down to earth. And out of character with the classical music they play on the radio - I suspect at his wife's insistence. A nice change from most fast-food places that blare the latest pop monstrosities over the in-house sound system so that the staff can keep themselves awake, despite the fact you just came in for a nice quiet lunch on your lunch hour from work, to get away from the noise of the office. Too bad.  Good quality meat, cooked fresh, meaning, you have to wait a bit. Restaurant is a bit rough - not dirty, just beat up - but the food is worth it. No-nonsense meal at a fair price, nothing microwaved (sorry - Dairy Queen thinks they are fooling people by calling them 'warming ovens\" but we all know what they really are), just good food."}
{"text":"A really interesting burger place. Lots of different selections (both meats and toppings). They make it your way. No pretension here, but a way better burger than a lot of fancier places.  They advertise a free range burger, which I need to try and find out about.  Also really tasty onion rings. Not expensive, great value."}
{"text":"Well, this has been my favorite burger place in Calgary for some time, so I'm biased.     But by proclaiming it my favorite, I'm comparing apples to apples:    a place where I'm stepping up to a counter or drive thru, and ordering  something I can take with me in a bag.    Sure \"gourmet\" burgers exist in sit down restaurants and steak houses.   But that's a topic for another day.  The Inn:  If I'm grabbing a burger and fries, I'm succumbing to my lust.  The gym time and healthy eating has banked some credits, but now it's time to blow them.   And when I fall off the wagon with a cheat meal, it BETTER be worth it!!     Ah, debauchery.   I want to be seriously satisfied by the flavors.  And then I want it on a massive scale, so I can prolong it for as long as possible.     So step up to the counter, and either custom order your monster, or go with a BI special.  Hey, lots of choice if you go custom:  beef, bison, salmon, ostrich, wild boar, chicken, veg. etc. for the patties.   Go double or more if you want.  Grilled over flames means it will be better.  Then dress that bad boy with options.  All you expect, and some extras that show they know how to do it right.  Gotta love fried onions on top.  A little extra \"fried something\" can never hurt when you go this hard.  Plus, that's how I do it up when I go all-in grilling at home.  Prefer to let the Inn handle most of the decisions?  The Super Burger is indeed that.  When I put one back, I almost don't have room for fries.  Almost.  Ahh the fries.  If you start moving beyond the \"regular,\" they're basically filling up a lunch bag with them for you.  And they're good, too.  Why doesn't EVERYONE do it \"fresh cut\" skin-on style?  It just plain tastes better.  With the last bite of burger, and final fry consumed:  deep satisfaction.  And guilt.  But at least I always go with the whole wheat bun option!"}
{"text":"ok food HORRIBLE service!!!  Ordered curly fries was given onion rings when we told them we ordered fires and didn't want the onion rings they told us pretty much too bad and if you want fries they would charge us for both.  Very rude not nice at all!"}
{"text":"When I was growing up in Calgary, Burger Inn had many more locations in the city.  They even had a location in my neck of the woods in NE Calgary when I was in elementary school, which is now a Vietnamese Sub shop.  They were known for having more exotic burgers, and the Ostrich burger was a running joke between my friends and I, mainly because we were all too chicken to try it.  Growing up, I recall that Burger Inn was voted Best Burger in Calgary for a few years, although I haven't kept on top of that recently, so I don't know if some other establishment in the city has usurped that title.  I was exploring the Mission area one day and stumbled upon this location purely by accident.  While accessible from 4th Street, it's off to the side so if you're walking South and not paying attention, you'll miss it.  Anyways, I was pleased to discover that, yes, they still offer ostrich burgers, in addition to bison (which is my new favourite meat), prime rib, angus, and all sorts of other meats.  The burgers come loaded with whatever toppings you want, although you'll have to purchase most of your sides separately as they don't have very many menu combos.  That said, their menu's packed with all sorts of items, and it took me a while to comb through them all.  In the end, I believe I settled for a prime rib burger (still don't have the guts to try the ostrich), and it was well done, if a bit messy with all the toppings.  If you're looking for a place to try an exotic burger, check out Burger Inn, one of those Calgary establishments that has found a way to stick around for many years.  19/30"}
{"text":"It is what it is and what it is, is good 'ol fashion comfort food.   Great Poutine, of the authentic variety."}
{"text":"I have been to the Burger Inn a few times in the last couple of years. My most recent visit a few weeks back will be my last. When I walked in I noticed that the only people in the restaurant were the staff. I placed my order and watched the man who took my cash head to the grill to prepare my food without washing his hands. Gross! More red flags went up when I decided to wash my own hands in the washroom. Usually I avoid restaurants with filthy bathrooms. I should have canceled my order at this point.   My 1/4 pound hamburger was prepared and brought to the table fairly quickly. There wasn't anything remarkable or special about it. The fries were ok, but again, nothing exciting. Didn't feel all that great after eating. Probably psychological after seeing dirty hands touch my food. It was pretty disappointing. I remembered the Burger Inn as being quite good the first time I visited.   There are far better burger places in the area..."}
{"text":"Going to Burger Inn is like a religious experience. Many years ago, a friend introduced me to the location in the NE (since long gone), and I've been hooked ever since.   If I was to describe their burgers in only two words... they would be \"Seriously Delicious\"  My favorite is a Super Chicken, with mayo, teriyaki, lettuce and extra tomato. Just doesn't get better for a chicken sandwich.  The location on 4th also has some really great people working there who have been part of the chain since the beginning, so you're sure to be treated great and have a great time.  Parking on the other hand, is a bit dodgy, but I've gotten away with taking a chance on the lot behind the building."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the veggie burger  - one of the best in Calgary! Fries, onion rings all delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Burger Inn is the best.  They have such a huge selection of burgers -- there is some burgers I never knew existed like ostrich or deer!  I have always stuck with plain old beef with cheese which was never done me wrong.  The burgers loaded with everything is absolutely delicious.  And their french fries are also fantastic.  I've had a couple chocolate shakes from there too and they are heavenly.  If you are looking for excellent fast food this should be your number one choice.  So yummy!    The service is always great & friendly & fast.  I have never had to wait more than 6 minutes for my food.  I always get my stuff to go but it seems like fun place to have lunch, maybe in the summertime."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they seems like they've stopped caring. The last few times I've been in the food has been so disappointing! Undercooked or overcooked fries, I had a salmon burger that was cold in the middle! I won't go back as every time I do I'm disappointed. I hope they pick it back up."}
{"text":"Originally founded by two out of work PhD's The Burger Inn serves messy, oozing, but scrumptious burgers. I suggest trying a different burger each time as not all of them are fantastic and the selection is huge (buffalo, elk, pork, lamb, wild boar, and vegetarian just to name a few). And when the clerk says \"with everything?\" just say yes and they will smother your burger with all kinds of goodness.    Unfortunately you don't get the same level of quality every time you go, sometimes the burgers are a little over done, sometimes 'with everything' includes mushrooms and sometimes it doesn't but, for me at least, it's unpredictability is one of the charms."}
{"text":"If you are a burger fanatic who enjoys a real burger, this is the place to go. The inside of the restaurant is a head trip from the early 1980s and the burgers are off the charts - great price, extremely high quality. I cannot praise this place enough. Don't take my word for it - get a burger from there and taste for yourself."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I like that you can choose from a variety of meats. I like that you can also choose many toppings and even brown bread buns.  I have been her a few times and its been good every time. The only issue is the seating in the restaurant is limited."}
{"text":"Ended up here when we tried to go to Tommy Burger - only to find that it was closed! Burger Inn to the rescue!    I just had a regular single beef burger with cheese and the works on it. This thing was big and satisfying! We had rings and poutine as well -we loved the rings. Neither of us were feeling it when it came to trying any of the unusual meat patties so I can't comment on those BUT I think it's nice to have the option for those adventurous souls out there!  Not really the best burger I've ever had - but heck, they do have a decent burger going for them and that you can't mess with."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about Burger Inn. They certainly seem to have variety highlighted by the availability of the elk, ostrich and lamb burgers on their menu. They also seem to have quite the following punctuated by all the customers that came in while I was enjoying my burger.    I had a prime rib burger, sweet potato fries and a can of pop totaling $10.25 ($5.49 for the burger, $2.99 for the fries). Both were good, but felt the portion of the fries could of been bigger. The inside is small consisting of a handful of tables, but it seems like the majority of customers take out.  Good experience, but expected more."}
{"text":"My partner and I enjoy going to this place. The menu has a variety of different burgers to choose from. The owner is always on location and is very personable.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I checked this place out because of the reviews on Yelp...which don't normally disappoint.   The curly fries were pretty good, if a bit undercooked, and my bison burger was so dry I ended up dunking it in ketchup before each bite (which was less than optimal as I'm not much of a ketchup fan), it was also rather bland. The staff seemed nice enough though.   I may give this place another shot sometime as I now work nearby (and don't like giving bad reviews) but I don't have high hopes. I think the DQ is closer...and cheaper. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"The last time I tried to go to Burger Inn at the McLeod Trail location - they were closed. A wonderful Pakistani restaurant is there now - so that is some consolation, at least... I am over-due to pay a visit to the 4rth Street Burger Inn Location which has been equally good. The SUPER HARVEST GOLD (Veggie Burger) is what I always... get. It is so yummy!!! Veggie burgers can be boring but this one is a flavour stand-out! Their fries are exceptionally good. I sometimes... get their poutine; Hands down, their poutine is the best! :-)  When I have gone to Burger Inn with others (with varying orders) there has never been a complaint. We are all gobbling down the food and leave full and satisfied. :-) The ambience is plain, but not unpleasant."}
{"text":"Double beef burger, yam fries and perfect service. 2 patties was a little much but the taste was very fresh and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here in a few years... I remember when this place first opened during the late 80's/early 90's a couple blocks further south (roughly 4th st. & 20th ave SW) in what was previously an old laundromat. That was the first and only location at that time, and was a truly unique burger experience for Calgarians. But long gone are the hand-made fresh patties, replaced today by pre-made frozen patties. Regardless if they're made by Burger Inn or not, a frozen patty is a frozen patty IMO. I find them rather thin, hard, and lacking in flavour. This might also have a lot to do with the fact they tend to over-cook the patties. Probably trying to hide the fact they're frozen.  Still, not an entirely bad burger I suppose (I've had far worse), but nothing I'll be eating again anytime soon. Besides, I found the owners son (who now runs the place?) to be quite full of himself, obnoxious and rude. I also saw the way in which he treated the three people ahead of me, so this guy really needs to work on his people skills. Had it not been for this fellow, I may have rated this a 3/5."}
{"text":"I'd like to rate it 4 stars, but that would be over-reaching: 2.5 is closer!  After talking to the owner - an older gentleman who'd been owner for many years - and feeling hyped to try one of their featured burgers, I did and can only rate it 3.0 tops. History cannot make up for what is missing in the food!   The burger was good, the fries a nice sidekick, and the garnish ordinary, and boring: this burger with special meat was not at all outstanding re. flavours, etc. In fact, after being assured it was the best burger in Canada - as sprayed all over the outside window - I had to conclude his assessment is highly inflated, for it was far from that!  The interior is clean but with no flair for decor or ambiance. In fact, it very much is a metaphor for the burger meal: just plain, plain, plain.  If you crave a better burger in the general vicinity, either check out The Rock on 17th past 14th Street, or Naina's at the other end of 17th near MacLeod Trail. They and perhaps others nearby are much closer to what I used to bbq at home..."}
{"text":"On first glance, Burger Inn doesn't appear to be vegetarian-friendly with its proudly advertised \"exotic\" meats. However, I assure you that it is. In fact, their veggie burger (the \"Harvest\" burger on their menu) is actually one of the best meatless patties I have ever had. It is completely soy-free which is awesome for people with intolerances. The bulk is made of grains and mushrooms but you really can't tell. It really tastes like a classic fast-food burger.  Definitely make sure you order the fries when you go here. They're fantastic. I'm a sucker for home-style potato fries that still have the skins left on. Yum! The portions are pretty big so if you aren't a huge eater, the regular-size should be enough to share between two people.  Also as others have mentioned, yes the décor is outdated but I honestly think it adds to the charm of the Burger Inn. It isn't about flash; it's about serving delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"My name is Joey Mann and I have been eating at burger inn for many years. Great burgers, fries, and milkshakes. Accept I had a very awful experience at the MacLeod Location.  The people that run the location were very nasty to me. In the summer of 2010, after I've eaten there, I couldn't find Ice Cream Truck keys. So I looked around my ice cream truck and inside the place many times. The employee told me to shove my head in the garbage box, instead of unlocking the garbage box to look inside the bags. I'm sure as heck wasn't going to do that. After I looked inside the place a few times, the manager told me to leave, just because she was tired of me looking. I was shocked. I tried to reason with her politely, being like a can't drive without my keys, and she just kicked me out. I called my dad to see if he could talk to her, and I went back inside to the manager to pass her my phone and she grab it from me and hung up on him. They were so hostile to me. I was so appalled. I ignored them after and keep looking for my keys. The manager called the police on me, but I didn't care. All I cared about was retracing my keys and getting out of there as quickly as possible. My dad came as well. Suddenly the Police came and asked me and my dad a bunch of questions outside. Then they came to a realization. So the Police ask the manager to take out the garbage out of the box and let me look inside the bags and they were there this entire time. An hour and a half of my time was wasted, even when I had to sell Ice Cream just for a pair of my driving keys.  It was very unethical and unprofessional to not accommodate for me to  look for my keys. They wouldn't even help me find it.  I am so not impressed with there customer service. Ever since I had that incident, I have not set foot inside the MacLeod location. Perhaps one day I will come back, if they call me and offer me a free meal to repay for the predicament, and inconvenience they have caused to me. They can reach me at 587-889-9700."}
{"text":"Kobe beef burger, you're crazy! Yes, it's crazy. Crazy delicious, and it's also available at Burger Inn. You can find it along with the elk, bison and other delicious animals they also make burgers out of.  It's not a dive by any means. It's clean and comfortable, everything seems to be in decent working condition, but at the same time appears to be lost in the past in the best possible way. It's got the sterile diner feel with stock 50's inspired photographs, fake trees and no exciting colours. Even the most closed minded grandma would feel comfortable within these walls. It's basically the exact opposite to their exciting and exotic burger menu and that is pretty great.  Go here. It's classic and it's quality. It's an unassuming burger joint with an emphasis on what matters. Burgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers, veggie burgers, fries and shakes. Funky old-school ambiance- for real, not created with IKEA fixtures. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great taste! Totally recommended.   To be completely honest with you guys, the only thing I didn't like was that the person who attended me didn't know enough English to understand what I wanted to order."}
{"text":"Burger inn is my fav burger place in town. The selection is amazing, the price is right and the service is great.  This place is what burger joints should be: Plenty of options for patties (from Free Range Elk to Soy Bean to Spiced Beef), plenty of toppings.   Burger Inn offers milkshakes in a dozen flavors - Root Beer (my favorite) being one of them - and they're really tasty. While I can't eat there every week (so...many...carbs...) I eat there often as it's near by, open late and totally affordable."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a little girl (10+ years). This place will always be my #1 burger spot in Calgary. It is also my #1 Milkshake spot. I've never tried a better Vanilla shake in my life. I love it here because It's such a hole in the wall... It looks like a place that would totally give you food poisoning ... but it couldn't be more opposite. I've never had a bad experience here. The burgers are amazing. Beef or Chicken is all I've ever tried, but still my all time favourites. Super affordable too for how great the quality of food you're getting is. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"only place in calgary to get a cheap WAGU/yagi/yagu burger, beer fed cattle that spend their entire life being massaged and not moving, eating finest oats, and drinking beer constantly."}
{"text":"Old school goodness! Always alternate between cheese burger and Harvest gold. Ask for fried onions...totally makes it. I also ask for well done fries. I feel good supporting a small Calgary business. Friendly owner and staff. Come here more than once and they remember you. Doing it old school !"}
{"text":"This whole in the wall burger joint is great for a greasy burger!  There is a variety of different meats to choose from - very eclectic.  Definitely great for something new to try.  I can see why it is a staple for the Mission District!"}
{"text":"mmm, burgers  Small place, not many tables, but  a lot of people get there burgers to go.  Lots of different meat options, but I try to stick to the basic hamburger.  Nice staff, and tasty burgers, what else do you need."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVOURITES, I have been eating the Burger Combo for years, the charbroiled Burger loaded, meaning everything except cheese and  bacon, as I do not eat pork, or pork products. This combo is an amazing value, just under $7.00 for the burger, fries, and a can of pop. In my top 10 in Calgary for sure, love it everytime,,the fries are even better than the burger, so this combination is gonna rock your world, does mine. I have always admired their menu, but I can honestly say, I love this burger joint, but it has so much more to offer, I haven't tried but they have many many types of burgers, from Kobe beef, game meats, speciality meats, I stick to my Combo, must try it."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Burger Inn since 2001 and I have never had a bad burger. While restaurants now are talking about gluten free, organic, free range, etc., the Burger Inn has been doing a lot of these things since the 1980s. Best bang for your buck burger wise, and one of the most earnest places in town. Love it."}
{"text":"Back when I used to live in Mission (and used to eat meat more regularly), I would go to the Burger Inn about once a month. The reason I went there was because I would also do laundry about once a month and so while I was waiting for my clothes to dry, I would walk across the street to the Burger Inn and grab a burger.  Now, I wasn't one to get a massive burger so I would always have the quarter pounder with a cream soda and sweet potato fries. I love sweet potato fries and theirs are very tasty. Not too greasy and not too soggy either - just right. The burger was thick and juicy and very delicious.  If you're ever in Mission and wanna grab a quick bite, the Burger Inn is a good spot."}
{"text":"Neat little place on Macleod trail that you would miss unless you knew about the place beforehand. The burgers are fairly normal condiment-wise but in a good way. They specialize in different types of meat patties that are grilled fresh at a fair price.  I especially enjoyed the Elk burger and I will be going back to try again when I get the chance. Good for a quick bite when you don't want to be eating the greasy gross stuff from McDonalds.  Cheers and enjoy!  http://fongterence.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/neat-little-place-the-burger-inn/"}
{"text":"This place is highly over rated. We came here strictly based on yelp reviews and were expecting a great, quick meal. Complete opposite, I can go to Costco for the same nuggets and toppings the only thing that was semi decent was the beef patty but then again, when it's this bad we were just looking for something positive. Expensive & bland, be sure to explore elsewhere on 17th."}
{"text":"Burger Inn is an old-timey but cheap looking burger joint with appropriately cheap burgers. The burgers were about more or less the level and price of fast food burgers, and reminded me of that Burger Baron in Gasoline Alley were I once had the misfortune of stopping at.... okay maybe not that bad.   If you're really craving a mediocre but cheap burger, as sometimes one does, this is not a bad place for it - but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I discovered this joint while doing my laundry across the street at Oh Henry's.  This is a modest burger joint with an extensive meat menu.  There is the standard chicken, beef, lamb, but there is even deer, buffalo and ostrich.  I myself decided to try the buffalo burger with all the fixins.  Not bad, it's a bit oozy but makes it even more fun to eat!  The staff is pretty nice; they are very quick to recommend the not so traditional burger options.   There is even a great list of shake options in 12, 16 and 20 ounce sizes: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, or try something a little different like raspberry, root beer, blackberry, banana, peach and mango.  So this is what I like the most about this burger joint, if you feel in the mood of a burger, you are into adventurous exotic food choices and want to spend less than 10 bucks then Burger Inn it!  Nice take guys.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"We walked in and smelled bleach or chlorine. It literally smelled like the local pool, but after a few minutes it wasn't as noticeable. My hubby ordered the prime rib burger and I had the poutine...I asked and they said the fries are cut there. It certainly seemed like this was true. I was elated to see they used cheese curds. The man loved his burger and I have to agree it's one of the best I've tasted in this city.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Burger inn was very tasty. I've been twice already and so far so good. First time I grabbed a single bacon cheese burger with the works and a side of onion rings. I honestly have no complaints. Good home style burger, cooked on a grill, as it should be.   Went back again today and opted for the same order but doubled down on the burger party for a half pounder burger.   Consistent and flavourful. I will return!"}
{"text":"Another great hole in the wall burger joint serving everything from elk burger to bison burger to wild boar.  I had the bison burger which wasn't too bad. Only downfall is that the patty is quite thin. Was anticipating a thick and meaty patty, but maybe that's just a beef thing?   Not a bad place for a quick bite just off 17th avenue."}
{"text":"Where do you get the anti-chicken burger? Why, at the Burger Inn of course. Anti-chicken was the name the gentleman behind the counter had for the ostrich burger I decided to try. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from an ostrich. I hadn't ever eaten one before. I wondered if it would be tough and gamey? Or soft and succulent? In reality, it turned out to be neither, or rather somewhere in between the two. It had some juice to it, but it seemed more lean than ground beef or lamb.   If ostrich isn't your cup of tea, you could always try a pork, lamb, buffalo, wild boar, turkey, Harvest Gold (meatless), salmon, or chicken burger.  I stopped in around 2 pm, and wasn't going for a full meal, but I hadn't yet had lunch and figured a burger would tide me over until dinner. When I was asked if I wanted fries on the side, I hesitated long enough for the man taking my order to slide in \"not even a half order?\" \"Alright... just a half order.\"  The half order turned out to be what I would consider a full order of fries in most other places. My burger and my fries were ready in a matter of minutes, just like he said they would be. All in all, a burger, 1/2 fries and a can of pop all came out to under $8. Not too shabby!  The decor reminded me of the old school fast food joints when blues and pinks were in style (say back in the early 90s). But this didn't diminish the taste of that anti-chicken."}
{"text":"We arrived 10 minutes before closing, the owner welcomed us in, took our orders and then served them with a smile.  The staff appeared friendly and the burgers were quite good.  I wouldn't go as far to say best burger I town, but I will return to try the other selections.  Its worth a try.  As others have said, not the most nicest looking burger joint. Its clean at least, and you'r there for the food."}
{"text":"Baaaaa - what sound does a lamb make? The lamb burger was delicious! Very juicy and not over cooked. Topped with Swiss cheese and restaurant made BBQ sauce - the burger was a hit. If the bigger was slightly larger I would have given this place a 5 star rating. Single quarter pounder was good, slightly light on seasoning. Backyard BBQ taste - will you feel like you are backyard boogie-in."}
{"text":"Not highly impressed. Long wait times and mediocre food. I'm a person you can probably sell cheese and bacon on any burger and it wasnt offered. Seems like a place people used to care about but has lost its passion."}
{"text":"I've been on this burger kick as of recent and thought we'd check this place out.  It's been around for a while and the decor is not the most updated but it works for the location.  The burgers were cooked to order which was a short wait.  I had the regular burger with cheese and my boyfriend had the Elk Burger.  The flavours of the burger were done well.  They also put the toppings on the burger so make sure you modify if you need to while giving your order.    My only disappointment were the fries ... I had asked for extra crispy fries but were told that it wasn't possible with the fries they served.  I was oddly confused by this.  The fries were a bit soggy and I'm sure would taste great with gravy or in a poutine but we are big fans of crispy fries.  I also ordered onion rings which were quite tasty!  Overall a decent selection of burgers and food that's quite tasty."}
{"text":"Nice burgers, and great service!!.. The people is very friendly there. I found the burgers big enough and really good... I liked this place."}
{"text":"Always a good burger to be had here.  And it's one of te original place in Calgary to get a choice of meat other than beef.  You wan bison, or ostrich, or fish then this is your place."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall on MacLeod Tr.   Has 90s interior, but don't let the appearance detract from the great burgers.  There are so many choices of meats, and you can get your burger on a whole wheat bun.   The prices are reasonable and the toppings are quite tasty."}
