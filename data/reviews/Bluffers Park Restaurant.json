{"text":"My daughter and I were refused at the door due the fact we were wearing work clothes. We're both painters so they were paint splattered but freshly laundered and clean. The man at the door was very rude and didn't let us take a seat, even though the place was deserted. I was upset by this, we were planning to have a nice break from our work schedule. I don't trust the character of this place and I want to spread awareness to others."}
{"text":"The location is nice (by the Bluffs, nice park and beaches), the architecture and decoration are not too bad, but that's all the pleasure you'll get from this place. Sadly, the food ruins the experience - in a pretty bad way.

The caesars's salad was very average in the execution, lacking quite a few ingredients that make a good caesar's salad (it's not that hard, really). It's not just a matter of tossing bits of lettuce, some industrial croutons and bottled dressing. Not when you call yourself a restaurant. My tablemates were a little happier with their starters, but far from being elated.

Then I did the mistake of ordering the sirloin medium-rare, which got me a cold, overcooked and flavourless piece of meat. I sent the plate back and was brought another piece of microwaved lukewarm overcooked tasteless meat bathing in some watery juice. The mashed potatoes were saturated with garlic (one mouthful and you won't taste anything else), the greens were OK.

The desert was the best part, the tiramisu was tasty and well presented, nothing to complain about.

My tablemates who had the chicken and the salmon got luckier with their dishes, but it still wasn't anything to write home about.

Upon my remarks regarding my main dish, which I didn't eat, the waiter offered me another dish to go (the chicken, which seemed decent), which I accepted, only to find out it was the salmon when I got to my car. I hope the raccoons won't get sick from it.

Conclusion: Don't go there for the food. Have a picnic in the Bluffs park instead, it will taste better."}
{"text":"We get there looking for a nice place for the big  wedding. The place is beautiful, we start checking around and we wanted to try just a small thing from the menu,  like appetizers or soup. However that kind of attitude from the owner and then from the server was really annoying. Maybe they were expecting us to spend lot of money before to see. They should improve the quality in the service to anyone because we couldn't even enjoy the thing we asked."}
{"text":"Hosted a wedding dinner for about 60-65 people. The owner and staff were friendly, and the service was great. Very cozy place by the marina. The view off the balcony, overlooking the cliffs, was breath taking. The food was 5/5. Especially the salmon fillet and the roasted chicken. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Very attentive server Steve was!
Best coffee here in Toronto restaurant industry!
Definitely need to return. 
Wish I could visit this city more often. It's not crowded, even in tourist areas. Coffee tasted better with fresh air and good view."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back here for the beautiful view on a warm summer/spring day, with a gorgeous patio which overlooks the water. 
We were seated right away on the deck outside, and the table was well set with beautiful white linens and cutlery.
Our server was very attentive and kind.
The food was spectacular and very fresh. I highly recommend the smoked salmon and shrimps as appetizer, along with the calamari.
Linguine del mare hit the spot and was definitely a pleaser with fresh seafood and a very flavourful sauce.
Finally, the chocolate mousse was nicely prepared, not too sweet but very \"chocolatey\". Could have done without the berry sauce.

Finally, parking here can be a bit challenging with a lot of beach visitors and boat owners. Plan ahead for this."}
{"text":"I come here every year for valentine's dinner.  This is a one-of-a-kind location,  right at Bluffers' marina.  Live DJ for on v-day.  They own in summer for the mariners but not in the winter,  but they do open for v-day and wedding banquets.  Hardwood dance floor. Loft and all-around balcony.  Their wine selection is good and food is high quality,  through the years that i have come,  although the price has gone up every year. Free parking. Fabulous view. All glass window hall. Very relaxing environment."}
{"text":"The pasta was good but they had some sort of judgemental attitude when we first walked in. Which was really rude. Service wasn't that great either.  But I guess it's okay if you're at the bluff and you're hungry since it's pretty much the only restaurant nearby..."}

I'm writing this review based on memory. I had it in my drafts for quite some time but I forgot to post ^^\" The restaurant might be different now, who knows, but I still want to document my initial experience!

I absolutely love surprises! Never knew there is an old school styled restaurant by the docks at Scarborough Bluffs! Wooden interior with multicultural flags as decor. Floor to ceiling windows to capture the gorgeous sunlight by the waters. Perfect date spot to catch the sun/sunset!

Bluffers Park Restaurant is also a popular 'banquet hall' to host small weddings or cocktail receptions. The restaurant do expect you to dress well even on a regular day. Seriously, the place inside is NOT exactly fancy, but they think they are. So play along.

Came here on a late Tuesday summer evening. We were served by an older gentleman. He was working by himself on the floor. I got this annoyed vibe from him but that changed after we popped open a bottle of red while we waited for our meal.

Escargot in a tomato sauce with sautéed mushrooms, onions and black olives was delicious and appetizing! It was not presented on the traditional escargot plate, but rather on a simple flat plate. There was a generous amount of meat!

Sea scallops were nicely seared in a Teriyaki sauce. The sauce really compliments the green salad. It was a bit pricey for just 3 scallops, but overall a very enjoyable dish :)

Order filet mignon as my main, served with peppecorn and sautéed mushroom sauce. I enjoy my steak blue rare but somehow was talked out of it for medium rare lol. The meat was still cooked nicely.

Finished off our meal with a traditional slice of Tiramisu with fresh berries.

Overall, the food was very good! The presentation for the dishes were not exactly the best. Fortunately, from recent photos by Yelper Dia W., I think they might have up their game. I would come back again but for lunch this time, so I can catch all the sunlight and it would be perfect for a nice outdoor patio food photoshoot :)"}
{"text":"I have been here once a year for the past seven or so years for an annual work function.  We always have the brunch buffet.  Every year it is the same.  One word sums it up...blah.  The spread is identical each year in regards to the items served and the lack of taste.  I know a buffet is a hard thing to pull of well, but this place really underwhelms.  If this is the best they can do, I am not ever interested in visiting this out of the way restaurant on my own time.

The place itself does have a great view of the water and marina and that's why I give it two stars, but the service is sour.  I am not a fan of having arms thrust in my face while I am in the middle of conversations with fellow diners.  Yes I appreciate that wait staff need to clear the table, but there is something to be said, and that is \"excuse me.'

Save your coin and bring a picnic lunch to the Bluffs."}
{"text":"We were there for a wedding.  What a great venue!  The owner, Paul, was on hand and we had the service on one level and then went upstairs for a social time prior to the dinner that was back down stairs.

The food was rather good, we all had the salmon at my table.  It is hard to pull off a meal for 90 people and get everyone to enjoy, but this was a nice and enjoyable time and place.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best meal we ever had in Toronto (Kiwi lamb and sea food linguini). All the flavours were felt and it was not salty at all. The tiramisu is also very good for Toronto's standards.
The view always helps. Too bad it is far and a bit difficult to reach without a car!"}
{"text":"First thing the owner asked when we walked in was 'Are you going to order appetizers? You have to order from the main menu, check the prices before you decide if you want to eat here'. I was extremely offended because he thought we couldn't afford to eat there, but we were hungry and there's is nothing else opened around. So we settled and ordered three meals, we ordered two pastas and the 'captain's plate' all the seafood were overlooked in my opinion, and one of the pastas was too dry and tasteless. The only good pasta was the one we asked to change the base sauce from tomato to Alfredo. Server's attitude was alright, but not that polite either. Overall I did not have a good experience at this place. Extremely in satisfied."}
