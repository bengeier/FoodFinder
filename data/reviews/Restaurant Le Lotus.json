{"text":"If you are going to judge this family- run restaurant because of its size or the fact they take reservations or that you had to wait when you didn't have a reservation on a busy night, then you're doing this place a disservice. 

So, more importantly, about the food: it's AMAZING. Sure, it's a bit more costly than other places, but, one reviewer forgot to mention when they complained about the price, is that you do get soup and their spring rolls at that price point. 

The food here is fresh and made to order, so don't expect fast food service. The flavours are exquisite and, after trying a half a dozen or so of their dishes, not one has disappointed (although we have our favourites). 

Service can be slower on busy nights, but is just as fast if you hit them at non peak hours. Often you'll see this family sit down to enjoy their own meal. Very nice. And they're very friendly if they're not 'hopping'...and once you get to be a regular. 

So, look past its size or lack of visual appeal (to some) and embrace it's quaintness and ultimately go for its amazing fare."}

Par ailleurs, c'est le premier restaurant vietnamien qui s'est installé à Châteauguay et le restaurateur et sa famille nous offre encore et toujours un excellent menu dont la saveur et la qualité ont fait la bonne réputation de ce resto. Il est très populaire dans la région alors je recommande de réserver si vous y allez pour souper, les fins de semaine. Fait à noter: c'est parfois un peu bruyant lorsqu'il y a un groupe qui fête un anniversaire, par exemple."}
{"text":"We've gone a few times, and were turned away few more. There are limited seats at this location, and there are always a lot of invisible guests when we visit. They always ask if we have reservations, and tell us if we don't we have to wait 30-45 minutes. The first time we went, we did get a place on their terrasse. But we were promptly forgotten. No menu, no water, no service. I had to go back inside to remind the waiter that we were sitting outside.

The prices are slightly higher than I would have expected for a casual Asian restaurant, so we decided to share a plate of beef in a bird's nest ($30!). The portion was quite small, considering the price. It tasted alright, just wasn't what I had expected.

By the time we were ready to leave, those empty seats that we weren't allowed to sit at were still empty. The place does get busy, I've seen it when passing by. I just don't like getting told that I have to wait more than half an hour for a seat, especially when there are so many other selections in town, which is what we did the other time we were refused. Just turned around and walked out the door and found a delicious Italian jewel along the river nearby!

It's fun to try something new, but I don't think I'll be returning. Service was slow, and a bit rude. Oh, and the 40 minute wait for a seat when the place is not full."}

  They have Great lunch specials, fresh, tasty vietnamese food.
good for a quiet date night as well.

     The bird nests are a decent sized portion and the noodles have a great crunch with a mopping effect for the savory, well seasoned sauces.

    The service is a tad lackluster but it's 'bring your own wine' so drink till you think the service is good.
