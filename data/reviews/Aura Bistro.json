{"text":"I only went for breakfast and want pleased. When I arrived I was directed to the buffet which was very limited. It wasn't until I overheard someone all for a menu that I even knew you had the option of something other than the buffet. I wasn't even offered a menu. The server's weren't very attentive at all. I sat for 15 min after I finished eating and a server never came from the back during that time. Since I had already given the server my breakfast coupon, I ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza and ordered room service. I got the veggie risotto and it comes with a side so I got the spatzle... the veggie risotto was decent but the spatzle was so ... I hate to say this but disgusting. I'll add pictures so you can see how unappetizing it looks. Should have just left and gone somewhere else instead of ordering in..."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently and needed a quick bite to eat after a long drive into town. The food was good but service was lax and they seemed a bit confused. We ordered the special a burger basket and 4 beers for $20.00 then an additional burger basket so we could share the 4 beers. This special had been going on for well over an hour but our server didn't know where the button was and failed to put our order in correctly. Therefore one burger was done (mine) and the other had not been started (she only entered the 4 beer bucket). We could hear them discussing the issue and trying to find the correct button to push for future orders. Not a big deal but not exactly on point either. A litlle on the spendy side too. My burger basket (with no beers ) was $11.00."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Crown Plaza over the weekend and was glad that there was a restaurant at the hotel after arriving later in the evening.  It was pretty slow except for a larger group of maybe 10-15 people. Besides the bartender that greeted us, the staff was not that friendly. The waitress wasn't too friendly and didn't seem to be in much of a rush for anything. The Buffalo flat bread was pretty good and the Cleveland burger was also good. However, the service was slow.  We waited for quite a while for a burger and sandwich and there was just us and the other group.  While we were waiting for our food, the larger group was already eating so I'm not sure what took so long for the food to come.  I'll give them the benefit of the  doubt because they could have had a lot of room service orders. I thought the menu was very over priced. $28 for a sirloin steak, so I figured to order something cheaper on the menu. The burger came with 4-5 large fries which didn't look like much for the cost, but it was enough. I feel they were trying hard to be an \"upscale\" restaurant but the only thing upscale was the pricing. Overall, if you want room service the burger was worth the price."}
{"text":"We had an awesome waiter and the menu was clean and affordable. We had the salmon and it was perfectly prepared. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
