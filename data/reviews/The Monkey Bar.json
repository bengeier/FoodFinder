{"text":"Really nice service and a good place to sit with friends and char for hours (which is what we did). I had a delicious rainbow trout entree with a super pineapple salsa and creamy mashed potatoes. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Food: BBQ ribs were warm but not hot, with tiny portion of coleslaw and beans. My friend's chicken salad was dry - yuck! Will give them credit for making some sweet cocktails though."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing, from the service, ambiance, drink and FOOD! I had the Chinese pancake as an app, maple glazed salmon for a main, and the eton mess for dessert. I was with a table of 4 and each of us got something different and we were all impressed. Will make the trek back!"}
{"text":"Good for a neighborhood bar.  I think it is a bit too loud though.  It's not a place where you go \"out\" like the southside.  It's a place where you hang with friends, so I don't see a reason why the music has to be deafening.  The patio is pretty great though."}
{"text":"Went with friends tonight for winterlicous. That on a Monday night a restaurant can be so full is a testament to the quality not only of the food, but also of the service. The menu was excellent and the wait staff attentive and personable. We all had a hard time choosing what to eat it all looked so enticing. I chose the tourti√®re with braised red cabbage and a chicken spring roll starter. The rolls were hot, fresh out of the deep fryer, but not a drip of oil on them. Tasty. The main was so delicious. Comfort food for winter. The portion was so generous I couldn't finish it.  For dessert again the choices were difficult. I had the banana muffin with chocolate cream cheese icing. De-lish-ous! We lingered a long time after our meal was finished and the wait staff continued to fill our water glasses and ask if we wanted a top up of our coffees.  Our friends now have a new place on their list to go for dinner. I love sharing great places to eat. The only downside for me is will I be able to get a reservation next time?"}
{"text":"We went here with a reservation over winterlicious on a Saturday night. I'm not sure where the name came from because it is a rather small and non descript restaurant. Still very nice and matches the yonge and Lawrence area. I think most other patrons there were  in the 40+ age range so I felt a bit out of place. They seated us quickly but it probably in the least comfortable spot. The food was good , no complaints, and the service was timely. nothing exceptional however."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a dinner with some good friends. We all decided to do the winterlicious menu.  App: Chinese Pancake with Duck Confit (2) Main: Salmon with maple chipotle glaze, sides: string beans, bok choy and sweet potato fries Dessert: Brownie with Raspberry Sorbet  All the portions were regular size! This was a pleasant surprise.   Everything but the dessert was wonderful. I found the brownie a little over cooked let's just say I couldn't cut it in half). The salmon was cooked perfectly. I would go back just for the salmon. Service was quick but I did feel a little rushed near the end. The place is on the small side so it was packed!   Make reservations!"}
{"text":"This is such a romantic restaurant! I wish more guys took me to hidden places like this instead of fancy expensive joints on Wellington. This Italian restaurant is as authentic as it can get. The menu contains diverse dishes to satisfy most people. You can get lamb, duck, liver, veal, steak, pasta so on and such. I had shrimps, which was delicious. The sauce was so tasty! I had an ice cream for dessert, which was amazing too. Men. Listen to my advice. Take your lady here and you will have a date to remember!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to. The prices are awesome and the beer is cold. The deck is real nice also to sit out there and eat on a spring or summer evening. I went to wing night on a Wednesday and they were sold out so get there early if you plan on going for wing night. Besides the wings being sold out I did love the place."}
{"text":"First things first, this place is on the pricey end.  Don't let the word \"bar\" fool you. I got a groupon daily deal $30 for $60 worth of food (if I remember correctly).  It is best to try to reserve a spot because it was pretty crowded although it was Friday around 8.  We ordered one set course meal ($35) and one entree ($19).   The set course meal consisted of: one salad, one entree and one dessert.  We got the brie salad which was 2 lettuce with 2 fried brie pieces which was nice and gooey, entree was bison meatloaf which was a bit salty for me but still very very tasty and lastly and the best we got eton mess for dessert.   Eton mess was lemon curds with maccaron layer and strawberries, it was the perfect sweetness and tartness . The other entree we got was angel hair tiger shrimp pasta which was delicious and the shrimp was huge.   The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because although it was tasty, I wouldn't go again because its just a once in a long while thing cause it was just too pricey for me (I'm a student).  I would rather get a steak at the price.  I went for the experience but I would recommend it to someone with a fatter wallet!"}
{"text":"Best Long Island Iced Teas anywhere. I love coming in with my nieces when they are in town and sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Great true bar.  Barry the owner is a great guy and always around. Very reasonable prices on food and booze. They have an awesome patio open all year round which is great. You can smoke in their so if it does get crowded it can get a little overwhelming but the patio helps that issue. I highly recommend for lunch, happy hour or just a night at the bar."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.   We had the duck confit and the steak frites. Both were cooked to perfection. We shared the Eton mess for dessert. Wow wow wow!  Reasonably priced too...with alcohol the bill to $150 all in."}
{"text":"Richard the chef has a no nonsense approach to food.  Solid, good flavors with fresh ingredients.  I know what I am getting and sometimes I like that.  Service was nice but not great.  A solid place in my goto list."}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant in Toronto  Unique caesar( little Potato anyone Rack of lamb   Best burger in Toronto (bison burger)  Consistent quality in 20 plus visits over 10 years my wife has never sent a meal back which is almost an impossibilty"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterliscious and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Wait staff was fabulous, very friendly and informative. My chickpea crusted shrimp appetizer was scrumptious followed by Arctic char that was cooked to perfection. I finished my meal with a very tasty sticky toffee pudding and our wine (Riesling) went so well with the meal. Would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Good place for special occasion. Ontario beer is good. Try it. We had fish, shrimps and chiken."}
{"text":"I would love to give this location 5 stars. The staff is awesome. The food is very good. Great location and specials. The atmosphere is fun and makes you want to stay. I love that there is a jukebox and dart boards. My only issue is the smoking. There are few bars that allow smoking where food is served and I think this is one that should ban it. The smell of smoke while I'm enjoying my buffalo wings is not pleasurable. Other than that this place is a great spot."}
{"text":"As an out of towner looking for a good meal and some play off football I was pleasantly surprised. First the staff and other patrons were very friendly. The food was really good considering how fast it came and the music that was paying was good. The only thing I would complain about was the lack of good local craft beer on tap. Other than that this place was a fun night out."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting about the food. But those Long Island iced teas... totally worth stopping for. The bar gets a little smoky, but the outside deck is great."}
{"text":"Summary: a great choice  Service: 8/10 Food Quality: 10/10 Ambiance: 8/10  I've been to the Monkey Bar approx 20 times over 5 years as I live in the area. The quality of the food is outstanding - it's clear the chef/owner takes pride in what he serves his clients; with quality, fresh ingredients. The ambiance is average - nothing special. The service is fine. A summary of some of the items I've had include:   Planko-crusted eggplant - 10/10 Shiitake -mushroom egg roll - 5/10  Calamari - 8/10 Pistachio goat cheese -8/10 Penne - 10 Ravioli - 10 (superb)  Duck -9/10 Veal Chop -9/10 Rack of Lamb - 8/10"}
{"text":"Good bar food, cheap beer, great people, both staff and patrons."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying I've only been here once and it was during Winterlicious.  I've had a lot of bad experiences with Winter/Summer licious dining but I decided to give this a go on a weeknight.  OK - $25 for a 3 course dinner instead of for one entree sounds great but it honestly felt like $25 worth of quality food was stretched across the 3 courses.  The apps, main and dessert all felt pre-prepared as they came out so quick and a lot of the side dishes were repeated between different meals of schnitzel and veal.  I know they have to make money but I was hoping for a bit more.    I read a lot of great things about this place and was very excited to try a local neighborhood gem.  The atmosphere was nice and I like the diverse nature of the menu.  I will come back though and order off the main menu at some point and reassess."}
{"text":"Bartender named Taylor is a rude $%&%@! Another server told her I was trying to get her attention and she said \"He can wait!\" Just wanted to get my wife a glass for her Smirnoff. Had never been here before. No reason for her to be so rude. Never again!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and great bar food. The service is exceptional. Always a great place to frequent during a hockey or football game. Parking is a pain and the building is small. Smoking is allowed which can be a pain but overall it is a great little place."}
{"text":"Really liked this restaurant. Kind of an eclectic random menu which I wasn't sure how they would pull off. Was pleasantly surprised though the food was really good! Atmosphere which is always a huge component for me was great. Subdued but nice feel, full but mellow. I would definitely go back and I would order the same thing, which says a lot! Great for place for a date night spot or dinner with friends who you actually want to talk to. Not too loud."}
{"text":"Dropped by for Winterlicious a little while ago ($38/person). Atmosphere is nice, it's very elegant and classy. I would say that the seats are quite tight and pushed together - due to location and what I'm sure is lack of space but once seated, it's not uncomfortable, just takes some maneuvering to get out.   My friend & I got half litre of red wine to go with our meal; I ordered the grilled calamari - it was wonderful, it was grilled beautifully and soft, with the right texture - not overly chewy. It was drizzled with a light tangy dressing, I would definitely order it again. My friend ordered the chickpea fried shrimp which she didn't love. Some of it was overly breaded and didn't taste amazing, but was decent. I ordered the roasted rack of lamb. Once again, a great dish, ordered it to medium rare and it came out as requested. My friend ordered the braised beef short ribs, I didn't try it but she said it was very good. We would both order our mains again! Well done on both counts, sauce and quality of meat was done perfectly. Dessert was decent at best, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding which seemed more like an alright coffee cake and the flourless chocolate walnut torte with raspberry sorbet. The sorbet really didn't fit the torte in our opinion. A nice vanilla ice cream would have mended it together nicely but the sorbet was too sharp for a flourless torte and it was very brownie like.   Minus the dessert, appetizers (calamari) and mains were a hit. Would definitely come again to try their food. We had a reservation for 6:15 and were told that we had two hours to sit when we made the reservation over the phone, we had finished our meal around 7:45 but had not finished our wine but by 7:55-8:00, we had been asked to shift to the bar because the next table was ready to be seated and had been waiting. The waitress was very nice and apologetic for this and we just finished our wine and left so that the following table could be seated as we understood the rush but wish we would have been told hour and a half seating so that we could pace the wine accordingly."}
{"text":"Great setting and atmosphere. The design layout is a bit awkward as you have to walk quite a bit into the restaurant/bar area before the waitresses greet you for seating. Overall the food was great, especially their desserts which caught me by surprise. Although the food was great, it doesn't quite stand out as exceptional due to its price but is definitely a candidate to visit again."}
{"text":"Friendly, excellent service Wide variety on the menu..everything is great! Nice decor and ambience Great location  I just hope it remains viable...most nights it's quite empty.  A excellent restaurant...deserves better attendance."}
{"text":"Always our choice for dinner and drinks - our spot!!  We've been going for 18 years because of the serving staff, Bud, Nick the cook...  Everything works. Best wings, French onion soup, fries, salads, sandwiches, and try the Black Jack Steak Hoagie, fish sandwich, or fish on a dish. Divine. The women know your drinks, see you walk in and follow you out with your order. Just the best staff. Xoxo love this place. If they ever move they must move with us."}
{"text":"My only complaint is how smokey it is in here! Yuck! Other than that, the food and drinks were great. Had beer and a long island iced tea. It was a well made drink, and a great place for a quick double date. The place was bumpin with music and drinks were flowing. It was tough to get a seat, as it was so crowded. Fun little local place"}
{"text":"Our Summerlicious pick this year in an effort to explore more restaurants near us. The set menu looked good for $35 tier.   Started with the grilled octopus which was very tender and came with chipotle aioli for dipping. My bf had the caesar salad which didn't really stand out as anything particularly special but he liked it.  For main course we both got rack of lamb. It was very good. Cooked a perfect med-rare. The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing! My portioning was great, but my bf noted he got an end piece which was mostly bone so it felt like he had one less piece.  Dessert was a nice conclusion to the meal. I chose the Eton Mess which was nice and light with a generous serving of raspberry sauce and a large meringue. My bf got the ice cream sandwiches.  All in all our food was quite enjoyable and we'll consider coming back. Service was a bit curt at times but they were really busy so perhaps on a regular dinner service they are nicer and less stressed looking"}
{"text":"Great wings, actual full size 3 part wing, not the standard miniature  wing.  Great service and cheap beer."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and honestly this place never disappoints.   Tonight was another amazing dinner. I had the Calamari salad to start. Sooooo juicy and yet had the wonderful char marks that one would associate with grilled calamari.  Following that I enjoyed a seared to perfection blue rare 10oz New York striploin (I like it rare) and it was like cutting through butter. My hubby (it's his bday ;)) had the veal chop. OMG. Both dishes had the beefy flavor without the stink. Although the rub is slightly on the salty side ( personal tastes) I have to say the quality has always been amazing.  Again what is dinner without amazing service? Well the staff here are stellar. Absolutely amazing. Friendly, personal and smiling. (Even with a few screaming kids) common you have to be an saint.  No wonder they've been here for 15yrs and counting.  Here's to another 15"}
{"text":"Came up here for a couple of days for work from DC. I've been to the area several times but never went to the MB. I read a previous post about the Big Fish Sandwich so I decided to give it a go. Really good sandwich! Plenty of filets and tasty but not over done! Kudos! The atmosphere is great too! It's a local dive bar with great prices and the two lovely girls that work the bar are awesome! They work hard! The owner is a very nice man as well. Try it you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a night at the casino for a drink and a little food. The beer selection was nothing special and it is a bit of a dive bar but the French onion soup I had was very good. Bry also brought me home a fish sandwich after a few drinks with the guys and the thing was huge and good quality. If your looking for just a chill place to hang out then this is a good choice. If your looking for a place with specialty beer this is not it but the food is good and so is the price."}
{"text":"Local hang out for most people in the area.  I usually go on the weekends and the place always has a good amount of friendly people.  Oh yeah and they have darts."}
{"text":"I should have taken it as a sign that when we walked in for dinner and the restaurant was almost empty at dinner time, as a red flag. Bland, tasteless food. The pasta with chicken tasted as though the chicken was boiled. The salad with goat cheese came with a slice of goat cheese as thin as a tissue and a small bowl of cashew nuts, dried cranberries and a type of caramel brittle, which was an odd element to include with the cheese for an appetizer. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The name, which is certainly not synonymous with \"The Rain Forest Caf√©\", doesn't do justice to this restaurant's no-nonsense service and great food. Trust me, I hate fish. After one meal, this chef has convinced me that there's hope. I loved the atmosphere and that certain coziness that comes from have having dinner on a cold Saturday night in a restaurant with a full window view of Yonge St. This restaurant is one of up-towns hidden treasures."}
{"text":"Stopped there today and had some excellent bar food. The only thing negative is that they allow smoking in the bar. We ate on the outside deck. They allow smoking on the deck too, but was windy enough to blow the smoke. We'll go there again on another windy day."}
{"text":"I dropped by based on the reviews here.  Was looking for good food and a glass of wine. Veal was cooked perfectly  . Great service.  Awesome food. Nice California wine. Resisted dessert this time likely won't next time.  Will be back. Owner Mellissa and chef husband run a nice operation here."}
{"text":"The name lured me there, thinking it was an upscale Rainforest Cafe type deal. Monkeys, exotic appetizers, fine wines, more monkeys. Surely a night to remember, because of the monkeys. Alas, it was your standard white linen joint with standard white linen cuisine. Other than the name, monkeys appeared to play no part whatsoever in the theme, menu items, or decor. To say I was crushed is an understatement. Anyway, acceptable mid-town cuisine, but monkey lovers should not be confused by the name."}
{"text":"Pleasant and friendly service.  We had the calamari appetizer (great), vegetable soup (not good), pistachio goat cheese (ok), chicken penne (tasty but small), Eton mess and molten chocolate desserts (just ok).  Expected more because of the other reviewers but it was just an average meal for the price."}
{"text":"Visiting The Monkey Bar and Grill has become an annual tradition for me and my mom. We have been here every winterlicious for the past 3 years (this year will be no different, of course).  The food is delicious and the service is extremely warm and attentive.  We have been during the \"off season\" whenever my mom craves a good rack of lamb but it is a bit out of the way for us. Winterlicious definitely keeps us coming."}
{"text":"Monkey Bar is a modern upscale restaurant with a homey atmosphere, serving a variety of 'honest' food - the meals weren't overly fussy or trendy, the ingredients are fresh and explicitly stated, but there's a slight twist that just adds something special to the classic dishes.  DECOR: The decor is modern and intimate, with a long narrow layout that can be a bit awkward to walk through if you're seated at the back but overall i think it keeps the noises down as it's not your average large square dining room with everyone bustling about.   SERVICE: The sever was friendly, took the time to chat with us, and was knowledgeable about the chef's techniques. She made recommendations and wasn't overly obtrusive.   MEAL: Our starters included the calamari (which others said was fantastic), and an asparagus soup that was flavourful and creamy, despite being dairy-free! I'd eat my vegetables every day if i had this recipe. The main dishes were the crispy duck legs with shoe string fries and hoi-sin jus vegetables,  seared salmon with vegetables and a sweet potato mash, and the pecan-crusted chicken breast with vegetables and a mustard cream sauce, and sweet potato fries. Everything was just perfect. The duck legs were crisped to perfection without having that greasy Swiss Chalet taste which is easy to overdo when it comes to legs. They were seasoned nicely and the shoestring fries were a great light complement to the heavier meat. The salmon was a generous portion size, and the potato mash had a great texture and body. The vegetables all still retained their crunch, and were presented nicely rather than a slapped on side dish. The chicken breast was large and moist, and the mustard cream sauce was a perfect pairing with the crispy coating. The bonus was how nicely the meals were plated. It was a different spin on the classic chicken, duck, and fish dishes you'll usually find, and I'd certainly recommend any of the dishes to a friend.  DESSERT: For dessert, we shared the apple strudel. WOW. The portion size was very generous, two large strudel rolls and vanilla ice cream to top it off. The pastry was thick yet flaky, with a unique flavour that was almost reminiscent of baklava with a hint of honey. The apples weren't too syrupy nor too dry, and the pastry to apple ratio was on the money.  BOTTOM LINE: I couldn't get enough of this place! Would definitely recommend to others and return again."}
{"text":"Great long islands.  The food is top notch and the ladies behind the bar are great.  Only downfall is smoke."}
{"text":"Would give 3 or more stars buttt smoking  not cool  even on deck  me and party of 12 were not  5 by 5  your loss tips n business  sorry  here to enjoy atmosphere  not Fn smoke.  Going to primati bros. Until you fix. They say no smoking   period in or out!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable food. Smaller portion sizes but all the flavours and textures were on point. Prices were reasonable for a more upscale dining experience. Small and intimate setting. Very noisy when full. Family run restaurant. Service was alright, except it took forever for our bills to come. However, would not come back as nothing stood out as anything needing to be experienced again."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a couple of guests for Winterlicious -- it's a good choice for the neighborhood and price point. The panko-crusted brie with cranberry orange sauce was my favorite started, closely followed by the celery root and apple salad with candied walnuts, parmesan cheese and lemon thyme dressing. Solid choices in the mains categories were the grilled rainbow trout with lemon arugula pesto sauce, vegetables and garlic mash potato and roasted chicken breast with mexican mole sauce, vegetables and sweet potato mash. I was sure that dessert was going to be the best part of  meal (eton mess - lemon curd, whipped cream, meringue and pineapple), but it was a bit unwieldy on the plate and quite sticky. Still, it did taste good!  The staff were very attentive and accommodating with food intolerances (i.e. gluten) and easily made recommendations. Service is very good.  One of the best aspects of this restaurant is the low noise level. Even filled on a Saturday night, the noise level was low enough to speak at a low volume without needing to shout. That's a rare feature nowadays. The bathrooms, on the other hand, were kind of scary. Classic Toronto basement-style restroom down steep stairs and low-hanging ceilings and a bit grimy."}
{"text":"Great local dive bar. Somewhat smoky, buy hey, it's a bar. Prices are great, and service was friendly and fast - the owner was walking around inside and making sure everyone was being served expeditiously when we were there. Just the perfect place to come and unwind over a cold one with some friends if you're craving a real-deal bar experience. Loved the George Thorogood on the jukebox too..."}
{"text":"I was getting my hair done when the ladies in the salon started talking about the wings at the Monkey Bar. I had to laugh. When I moved to Pittsburgh the Monkey Bar was a dingy hotel with little bungalows that you could rent by the hour.  Not. Even. Kidding. At some point it was sold and the bungalows were bulldozed and the main building was re-done and turned into the bar/restaurant. I had heard good things about it for years and finally decided to try it.  We wanted to eat on the patio that had palm trees and bamboo posts but it was stormy. So we entered the bar and they told us to grab a table. I was disappointed to see that not only was smoking allowed but they had an actual cigarette machine.  The place is pretty small. There are chairs around the bar, 3 booths, and two high top tables that seat 6. We were given menus which stated CASH ONLY but later learned that they DO TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!  We ordered a Cajun Chicken Sandwich platter, a Fish Sandwich platter and an order of Buffalo wings.  The wings were whole wings, not drumettes. The were hot and crispy with spices on them but the buffalo sauce came in a small container on the side. The wings were good without the sauce but we did use some of the sauce.  The Chicken sandwich was spicy and juicy. The platters include coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was really good. The fries were big but could have used another minute or two in the fryer.  The fish sandwich was good. The fish was.lightly battered and fried to a nice crispness on the outside while the inside was nice and flakey. It came with tarter sauce or cocktail sauce. I went with the tarter. I believe it was homemade.  The food was good. If I go back i would sit on the patio. FYI Wednesday nights are wing night."}
{"text":"Came in after work. Good prices cheap specials and great service. Sit out back and chill.  Parking is limited so get there early."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to The Monkey Bar for a birthday celebration. All of us felt that the food was really overpriced and not that great. The eggplant dish in particular was bland and the tomato salad seemed like it had been prepared way in advance as it was not fresh.The servers had attitude and it was very clear they felt we should be ordering more food. Extremely uncomfortable experience. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is amazing overall - there was a couple of dish that I found ok: lamb chops and liver. Everyone in my group loved the soup, my goat cheese salad is amazing,and the steaks were awesome (according to my family). Lamb chops though is a hit and miss everywhere - it's very tricky to make.   I like the place overall. It's not a big place and there are enough servers to feed the hungry.   Street parking can be tricky - there's not plenty. But it's worth the trip and worth the hassle. My private was freezing because I was sitting beside the door and some people forget to close the double door, who does that? But freezing private (I know TMI) or not, I'll come back here.   I recommend this place - order steak and appetizer."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice staff, cold beer. Not seedy at all ...kinda place you find regulars and out of towners riding 51. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great local bar! Great prices. Good beer selection, given the area... And excellent daily specials - especially during Steelers games.. Oh, and the servers are friendly, personable, and attentive... A+ for local \"dives\"..."}
{"text":"This place is a great \"higher end\" neighborhood spot.  My family has been going for years. The food is consistently good. They arent trying to be anything they're not.  This is essentially the only place I ever order chicken on a menu. It's pecan crusted, uber juicy, hearty and comes with this creamy mustard sauce that is rich in the best way.  The dude who owns it is also just the kind of guy that you want to route for. He always comes out in his pajama pants (his uniform) and says hi."}
{"text":"Great bar when it isn't completely packed! It's nice to enjoy a drink on the back patio on a summer night."}
{"text":"Modern cozy restaurant of smart casual dinning. My experience this evening was wonderful. The restaurant wasn't too busy which made table chat a breeze. The server was gracious, knowledgable, and kind. The food was so authentic and full or flavor. It made me feel that the food I have come accustomed to eating at restaurants is of a much lower quality in comparison to this delicious wake up call. The prices with that said are in line with the quality of the food. Our table average per head was $40 which included desert, drink, tax, and a nice tip. Go visit it sometime and don't be intimidated by the \"fancy\" dress code Yelp says it has, the establishment still has that warm, locally run feeling which is so welcoming.   Yumm."}
