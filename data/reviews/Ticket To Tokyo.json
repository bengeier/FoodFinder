{"text":"A strange imitation of Chinese food. Teriyaki chicken just had a teriyaki sauce on the top and did not taste like teriyaki chicken. Chicken had a thick fatty  skin.  Do not recommend.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place opened in 1984 and hasn't changed one bit since.  This is a bad thing.  Ticket to Tokyo seems to specialize on serving meals just as if you were flying to Tokyo...  in 1984.  It seems like they just make one batch of food for the day and when you order slap it into a styrofoam container and you're all set.  The menu is actually kind of comical since it only has about 8 or 10 actual things to eat and then the other dozen listings are just some sort of combination of the other items.  If you want to try this place out, I suggest going before analog tv broadcasts cease to exist as the old tv in the corner still is running off of analog rabbit ears and I wouldn't bet money anyone working there is capable of upgrading it.  Lucky for them it's a TV/VCR combo!  If that's not working, there was strangely a pile of 5 or 6 Men's Health magazines in the corner...  doesn't really fit with the 1980s theme or anything Japanese.  On that note you can be sure if you're asian that you'll likely be the only asian person in there, which includes the staff.  You'd think with a over a billion out there they could find one just to try to give it some credibility...  Overall it gets 1 star...  it's worth trying out just to tell your friends about how weird it was.  Make sure you talk back to the guy at the register too, some other think he's an a-hole but i think he's just looking for you to be his friend..."}
{"text":"Great place for take out or sit down quick lunch. Price is right ($5-$6). Food is tasty. Served in styrofoam box. I'm not sure why Ste R. thought the food was supposed to be Chinese. It's Japanese and pretty close to the taste of many others I've had before. Interesting eclectic collection of books on the shelf."}
{"text":"When you're paying $3.85 for a lunch, it's hard to complain!  I love this place!  It's my favorite, cheap, downtown eatery!  For $3.85 I get a salad, rice, and a breaded chicken breast complete with dressing and tempura sauce.  The best part of this place are the husband and wife duo that own and run the business.  His personality is the best and I think it's the main reason so many people continue coming back.  Yes, it's VERY much Americanized Asian cuisine, but I will continue coming back for years to come.  I'm just disappointed that I just got a job outside of downtown.  This will, most definitely, be a place I'll miss."}
{"text":"I love Ticket to Tokyo! I moved away from Cleveland 8 years ago, and have never found another place like this. Good food, good prices and the owners are great. It is the perfect place for lunch in downtown Cleveland. Most people rave about the #2, but I always liked the tempura shrimp, #3. I have also decided to put into my will that my post funeral luncheon will be there."}
{"text":"This place is like an indoor take out stand. I had high hopes for this place, since I was hoping to find a good asian-ish place right by my office. I was completely disappointed.   I ordered the \"tempura vegetables\" with a combo meal - which included rice and a lettuce salad. The \"tempura vegetables\" turned out to be fried battered sweet potatoes, soaked in oil and somewhat inedible bc it was so greasy. My friend got the teriyaki chicken combo plate, which I was sort of looking longingly at bc I was so hungry ... but she said it tasted funny and was sort of discolored.   There is free hot and cold tea, and a jar of complimentary animal crackers at the cash register. I had 2 small styrofoam cups of tea, grabbed a handful of animal crackers on the way out, and headed back to the office still hungry."}
{"text":"People in there are very nice, the food was okay, but the service was great. The prices are great but I felt the food could have been a little better tasting. Ah well, I don't work in downtown Cleveland anymore so maybe next time I am in downtown I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price!  Very friendly service, too.  Used to eat here when they were located in the Old Arcade.  Sixteen years later, still as good as I remembered!"}
{"text":"I used to work much closer to Ticket to Tokyo, and therefore would visit more often.  I still work downtown, but a few blocks away and had forgottem about this hidden gem!   A co-worker and I were attending the re-opening of Public Square celebration and decided to stop in, OMG, just like I remembered.  I ordered the #2 which is called \"a little something\".  For $5, I received a generous portion of tossed salad with a yummy homemade dressing, fried chicken on a stick, spring roll and yummy rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds and drizzled in teriyaki type sauce.  This was SO good, and such a great value. In addition, the husband and wife team that own the place are super sweet!  I will make it a point to visit more often."}
{"text":"This place is the best. It is cash only and has a limited menu but that is fine by me. The food is excellent and is of very good value. The folks that work here make you enjoy coming - everyone that I bring here comes back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"A cheap little out of the way place off Public Square to eat. My food (Tempura Shirmp) was good and you got a decent amount for the price. My wife, however, had the chicken teriyaki. She said there was more fat on the chicken cut then meat and found the rice horrible. They provide free tea. It was ok."}
{"text":"After hearing Jennifer W. rave about how awesome and budget friendly Ticket to Tokyo was, I had to find out for myself.  I'm so glad I listened to her and ignored the lower star reviews below.  I ordered the #2 and understood why this place has been in business for so long.  The food is delicious and for $5 you are pleasantly full.  You can't get that anywhere these days! I'm not even going to tell you how funny and friendly the owners are because you probably already got that from the reviews below....and it's true!  I will definitely be coming back especially since I'm on a strict budget for the next 3 years =)"}
{"text":"Love this place and love the operators. A coworker introduced me to this pocket lunch place when we had a meeting at Key Tower. I'm hooked and only eat here when I work downtown. I'm Filipino and the food is the closest to home comfort food. For the price, $5-6, more than worth it. No sushi, but an awesome character. Be sure to dine in the executive area."}
{"text":"Just realized my last review of Ticket to Tokyo was from three years ago! I have been back many many times since then, and every time has been just as great.   Just a note - the location isn't on Euclid (for the last 13 years actually) - it is located at 55 Public Square in an alley off of Rockwell.   Once you find this place, make sure to bring cash and also to try A Little Something Feature #2"}
{"text":"Ticket to Tokyo, you are my Holy Grail lunch discovery.  I'll clarify by noting that what I look for most in a lunch joint is fast and friendly service. I can't tell you how irritating it is to have to sit around and wait 20 minutes for my lunch order, no matter how good the food is. The things others mentioned that they didn't like about this place are actually the things that I love the most. My favorite quality in small businesses is when they are unpretentious, and this place is the epitome of unpretentious. All that being said, let's get down to the basics: 1) They only have a few lunch combinations, actually they really only have a few items to choose from at all. Does this bother me? Not at all. I'm so sick of places that have menus 10 pages long, full of things that no one ever orders or that they don't do well. 2) All of their lunch combinations are $6.00 or less. I.KNOW. How you are wondering. It's a mystery to me too, but who's complaining?  3) The service is easily top 5 I've had in Cleveland. The counter service was just so genuinely friendly and so helpful. They pointed me to their most popular options and highlighted things like their spring rolls (made with chicken filling, not slimy cabbage) and the free hot and iced tea. It's usually pretty easy to tell when it's the owner also providing direct service because they have that sense of being so invested in their customers. 4) The Seinfeld reruns? On an old analog TV? Yes please. I could sit here all day. 5) The lunch combinations are actually well balanced despite how cheap they are. Salad + rice + protein + appetizer. Pretty perfect.  6) I have to give a shout out to the rice. Even a lot of really good Asian restaurants are lazy about their rice. They make it early in the day and let it sit so it gets dried out and tasteless. This may not be a big deal to some, but to fellow rice lovers you'll know what I mean. This place uses freshly made short grain rice right out of the rice steamer... topped with a bit of teriyaki sauce and black sesame seeds.... Oohhh yeahhh.  7) An added bonus is plenty of metered parking adjacent to the building. This isn't a big deal for those in walking distance, but I often avoid going to restaurants on public square because of the parking. Fortunately this place is at a spot that's a bit easier to get to and park nearby.   I could go on and on. I rarely rave about a place after only visiting it once, but when a place does everything right, it's hard not to give credit. I cannot wait to return and recommend to others."}
