{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 if it was an option. I live right down the street and customer service is usually pretty good when we come in to eat. I will say that their chicken wing combo is so worth it. Their food is not the best buuuuut you get a lot for your money. $6-7 for a 6 wing combo with your choice of lo mein or rice (wings are always big!) but be weary bc they ask what kind of lo mein and if you chose it with meat they upcharge (which they don't tell you about) They ask like that's how the meal comes. Sushi is mediocre, which I find it to be at most of the places in the area. Nothing to brag about so I usually just get something simple bc I don't believe their $10-14 rolls are worth it. 

If you're looking for something good but not great this is the place. Don't expect too much but it satisfies when you don't want to drive 20-30 min into clt for the better sushi spots."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and picked up (wanted to check it out for myself the first time around) they were busy, but the place seemed comfortably so, also a huge plus that they deliver. I'll list the only minus first, but want to say the positives way out number the one minus!
I had the miso soup to start. Plenty of seaweed and tofu, but the broth was somewhat bland. It was missing scallions, perhaps they were all out for the evening?
I also had the cherry blossom roll and the spicy tuna roll. Both were very good, fish was fresh as were the other ingredients (and everything was packaged well for a to go order). My husband is not a huge sushi fan, so he had the chicken fried rice and the rangoons. He really enjoyed both. Even the rice tasted fresh made with good quality ingredients. As other reviewers have noted the fried items were not overly so, everything was fried to crispy perfection and just right. It almost tasted as if the items were baked for crunchiness rather than fried, they weren't oily at all. That was probably the most impressive thing about this place, that and the fresh ingredients and overall  tasty offerings : )

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The manager and staff are always friendly and happy to see us. The sushi is fresh and they have the best calamari I've had anywhere! Try the dragons egg, so delicious. This is my date night sushi place."}
{"text":"Good quality and the service is fast! I ate at Masa on a Friday and it was packed. It took me less than 35 minutes to order, eat and pay."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, food is well above average and amazing for the price. Often times you won't be able to get them on the phone, there's a reason for that."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, especially the Cherry Blossom Roll.  
 Spicy tuna rolls were on the small side.  Ginger salad was also good.  Used a different ginger dressing than the traditional one Japanese restaurants use, but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for sushi on a Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, service and atmosphere. The fish was fresh and beautifully prepared. This is an absolute gem that has got to be under appreciated by the masses - seriously some of the best sushi I've had in Charlotte! Masa Sushi just earned two new loyal customers in this happy couple!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area and great for takeout, although I would say the sushi is only ok.  Had lunch here a few times as well and the food and service were both good."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place! The sushi is phenomenal and fresh! I've always ordered delivery and it's been pretty quick and the delivery guy is always nice and courteous! If you want some fresh and delicious sushi, call MASA!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty average but the chinese food is subpar, my biggest rant is their \"server\".  I've tried this place a few times and it's been the same girl, not only does she not have knowledge of what she's presenting but we have to ask anytime we want some kind of service. Tonight was the kicker, I saw her picking her teeth with her hand, how was I suppose to ask her for anything else after that. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Great for a neighborhood sushi joint. They have good lunch specials and I have never been disappointed with the food. A wide variety of sushi from your trendy Americanized maki rolls to your authentic nigiri."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, nice employees and fast delivery!  Great place!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Only giving 2 stars because service has gotten worse each time we started eating here. If you don't mind being asked for your order multiple times, this place is it! But the food is really good though."}
{"text":"NOTE: This is a draft I just posted, that's over a year old...

Misleading from the outside; the staff is VERY friendly and helpful, and the sushi is GREAT. Awesome, low key place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food! We love eating in or having it delivered. They are always prompt and very courteous! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A gem-do not let the shopping center location deter you! highly recommend-excellent service, a must try. Seating is limited-call ahead for a large group. Decor is updated and modern-will definitely be back again and again! Food-excellent."}
{"text":"Masa Sushi emailed me with an inquiry: 

We are always interested in knowing what happened and if there was a reason
why you decided not to purchase with us. If you could be so kind as to let
us know any issues or concerns you may have had at the time, we would
appreciate it. We are
asking for your feedback to help make your experience at Masa Sushi better.
We are always trying to provide our customers with the best service
possible.

This was my response:

Hi Masa Sushi,

I wanted to respond to your inquiry by informing you that I ordered a delivery of Sesame Tofu, Volcano Roll and an order of Steamed mixed vegetables with no tofu Saturday November 19. I received my food in a timely fashion. However, upon eating my food, I have thrown it up.

My request of steamed vegetables was not upheld. My mixed vegetables were cooked. My mushrooms were darkly spotted and mushy along with my rice. I cook with mushrooms regularly, as I know what rotten mushrooms look like. The mushrooms in my order were rotten. I assume this is why my special request of steamed mixed vegetables were cooked, in order to mask that they were not fresh. I special requested that my vegetables be steamed while online ordering as well as when I called the store to change my order from pick up to delivery.

I order from you guys regurlary, both dine in and delivery. I have grown fond of your dishes and sushi. I am disappointed with my quality of food that I was sold as I feel as if I have paid for garbage. I hope that you may share this with your kitchen staff, Management as well as Prep Cooks. Take into consideration that a paying customer should receive fresh, quality ingredients.

Thank you,
Bianca H."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to update my review here. It seems the place is becoming less and less customer-oriented. Twice in a row now we have had terrible service and they simply act as if they don't care. The first time, a group of us were there (8 people) and they took my order, but simply 'forgot' to make it. After bringing out 7 dishes for the table, the waitress asked if she could bring anything else. The table kinda went, huh??? Turns out the order was just dropped. I had to wait for my dish while the table ate. No comp, hardly an apology.

Last night, we again tried as a couple. My girl ordered the staple chicken/shrimp/asparagus while I ordered the garlic scallops. I commented on making it the combo and even discussed with the GF and waitress that we wanted the combo since it included rice and spring roll. When our food arrived, I was brought the dinner portion by THE SAME WAITRESS who now said \"The combo was not offered on the menu for the garlic scallops\". So she obviously just decided to change my order without my consent. I asked for the menu, to which she just went to the back and came out with a spring roll and rice, stating she was wrong, rather smugly. When our check arrived, they charged me the full dinner price (13.50) over the combo price (8.00) and 'comped' me the rice and spring roll. I explained my dissatisfaction to which I was told that I can complain to Albert (owner??). Me thinks I'd rather just find a new place. Too bad though, the food is great, but the service sucks."}
{"text":"If you want good sushi that is both fresh and reasonably priced, Masa is a solid choice. I both visit the location, and take advantage of the delivery service. Salmon Dream Rolls and gyozo delivered to my front door?! Yes, please. 

Both the food and the service are great. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! Very impressed with their food. Large portions, well presented, delicious and ridiculously fresh. The veggies impressed me the most. Extremely fresh and brightly colored. I dont like many chinese foods due to the fact the veggies are usually wilted, mushy and look like theve been under a heat lamp for a week. This place is the complete opposite. Very fresh. Its a small place, well decorated, the staff is very nice and attentive. DEFINITELY will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I agree with the other reviewer who said that it is a hidden gem.  The interior is calm, clean, and decorated- a very pleasant and appealing atmosphere. 

The staff (especially the manager!!) are awesome! I am always happy to see them when I go in or they show up with my delivery order.  I am either in here or ordering delivery from them all the time. After moving to Charlotte from San Diego, I was a little panicked that I'd go into withdrawals from my sushi addiction, and so I was ecstatic to find this place, especially up in Steele Creek. Woo hoo!

I have tried almost everything on the menu, and so far there is nothing that disappoints. My husband who is a little less enthusiastic about sushi likes a lot of menu items also. 

Bottom line: Great people, great service, great food - give this place a shot! I don't know where I'd be without them."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I am giving this place any stars is because the sushi is excellent for the price you pay!

Unfortunately, the service leaves a lot to be desired. I have tried this place 3 separate times and each time has gotten worse. If you really wanna enjoy what they have to offer, order to go!

The first experience my boyfriend and I had here was great. They were busy and each table was occupied, but our server was very attentive to our needs.

Unfortunately, the second time we visited our server hardly paid us any attention. The restaurant was slow since we came in during an off time in the afternoon. However, the young girl was too busy chatting away with her friends who came to visit. We both ordered a beer with water, but the water never came. We did ask a 2nd time after our food was brought out, but still no water. We each finished our 1st beers and were never asked if we'd like a refill. Our server never once asked how our meals were/how the food came out. After eating, we had to approach the hostess stand for our bill so we could leave.

Our last visit, we had hoped that our previous experience was just a fluke and our service would be better. There were only about 3 tables seated when we first arrived. Our waitress took our orders, but brought our appetizer at the same time as our meals. At this time, we figured not to make a big deal and simply ask for silverware/chopsticks. Some time goes by as 2 of the young waitresses sat across the restaurant and gossiped/rolled silverware, and we still hadn't gotten ours. Finally we just walked over and asked for some. A little later a third waitress came and asked if we needed refills since our drinks were empty. For the rest of the night, she attended to our table and was very prompt despite being the only one out of the three working. What upset me the most was when a call-in order was picked up and I could hear our waitress complain about the tip they left. I understand people leave bad tips all the time, but don't complain about it loud enough that other customers can hear you!!"}
{"text":"So first time here, and won't be going back. The food was just awful. Wanton soup tasted terrible, not sure what it was but off after taste. The spicy crab roll was not cut evenly, huge pieces and small pieces, looked like a child trying. The roll wasn't even remotely hot, even the Wasabi was dull. Rice with entree wasn't cooked properly and was still hard in middle. The sesame chicken was made with dark meat and was so bad I couldn't even eat more than a few bites of it. On the way out I  also noticed the inspection rating from December 7 was a 91, if i had seen that before wouldn't have even tried it. Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Eh, sushi not that great.  Atmosphere is weird since its a small place.  The girls they have working their (door and waitress) are totally clueless and make the experience not worth it.  

It's kind of a smaller Chinese/Japanese restaurant with ok sushi.  Bar selection is the normal asian minimal attempt to having beer.  I think they struggle with their identity and what they want to specialize in...at this point it's not much."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside, but they have good food, good customer service, and a clean, cozy atmosphere. We just moved to the area and are happy to have this place nearby (and happy they deliver!) Don't let the less than appealing exterior stop you from giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This was the best Japanese food I have ever had. Everything was fresh, staff very friendly, and minimal wait to be served. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Steele Creek!!!! If you love sushi you will love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good...service was ehh! Slow Sunday night, n our servers were in the weeds. Hopefully she was new! Besides that, everything was awesome. I definitely recommend to eat here."}
{"text":"Don't let the vicinity to a BiLo keep you away as this easily ranks among the top sushi I've had in Charlotte.  I passed by it the first month or two after moving to South Charlotte but finally gave in based on Yelp reviews and have gone there nearly weekly since.

The sushi is very fresh and never tastes \"fishy\".  The menu is very good but feels a bit limited sometimes.  Also I've accidentally ordered a sushi roll that is fully fried a few times on accident when the menu is a bit unclear.

All you need to know is the interior is very sleek, the prices are fairly reasonable, proportions are good (especially for sashimi), wait staff is nearly always fantastic, service is quick, presentation is very good and the \"hella hot\" is not spicy but is very delicious and is my favorite roll.

I've been looking for other sushi places but Masa has been far better than 4-star (Yelp) sushi spots I've visited."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you want some sushi and don't want to go far from home?  You go to your neighborhood sushi joint, right?  But only after checking the yelp reviews.  There weren't many reviews for the sushi and I was a little leery because this place seemed more Asian grill than sushi.  I'm coming from the Washington, DC area where they have a great food scene and a huge international community so I wasn't going to put the DC standards on a Charlotte restaurant but I still wanted some decent, if not good sushi. The two front of house people and waitresses were Caucasian and one sushi chef seemed to be Hispanic.  I'm not one to discriminate but usually if you go to a sushi place and there are lots of Asians patronizing and working there, you can almost be sure it will be authentic.  But, I'm in Charlotte, the demographics here are different, so let me just sit down and order.

The waitresses were efficient enough but not really friendly and not personable at all.  We ordered egg drop soup, the pupu platter, calamari, a volcano roll and the surfer roll, I think that is what it was called.  The appetizers were really good. Egg drop soup had a nice flavor, though I would have loved to have some lovely, crispy fried noodles to put in them.  No one offered them and no one was around for me to ask so I just ate the soup as is.  The calamari, rings only, were nicely seasoned and the spicy mayo was a nice accompaniment.  I love tentacles but hubby will order calamari, no matter what, wherever we go.  The dumplings and egg roll and wontons in the appetizer were nicely seasoned and crispy and the egg rolls seemed to be filled nicely with ingredients other than a bunch of cabbage like you often find.  So that's great but I'm really here for the sushi.  Here's my problem:  The plate comes and I'm looking at it strange because I have never seen sushi served this way.  Stacked on top of each other and one with a pile of hot, steaming seafood on top. I don't even know what it was supposed to be because it really tasted like fake crab meat cooked in spicy mayo.  So the waitress says, do you know which one is which and then proceeded to point out what each roll was.  The second roll,  seemed to be lightly coated in tempura batter and fried and it was warm!!  Gross!!  I've eaten sushi for years! I even made sushi at home and it was pretty killer for my first time and I have never, ever, ever heard of, seen or eaten HOT SUSHI!  I even googled it when I got home because I thought that I was missing something and just clueless.  The texture and warmth was so off putting, I nearly gagged.

In addition to it's temperature, the one roll with the hot seafood on top was so tiny and so unevenly cut, it looked like Ray Charles was in the kitchen.  The other so large and thinly sliced and battered and fried?  How could I go so wrong?   I was so disgusted and disappointed that the decent appetizers couldn't make up for this atrocity. Yes, I should have just stuck to my usual because I know I'm getting raw fish, rice and nori but I wanted to try something different.  Big mistake.  Please Charlotte, tell me you have a great sushi restaurant somewhere because this place just wasn't it.  If I were ever to go back, it would simply be for the soup and apps!  That is all!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat in, food is good service wasn't great but mainly because she never actually asked what I wanted to drink, will definitely come back and try again."}
{"text":"Love this place, been here several times and the food is always great quality & tastes great, staff is super friendly and prices are incredibly fair. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the first review I've taken the time to write. The \"fried\" rice is nothing but brown rice. The vegetables have NO taste. The curried shrimp is unbearably hot. The egg rolls are disgusting. Soup broth is like water.  AVOID. Much better places around. 

What happened? The food here used to be excellent. I'd call and complain but I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"We eat at Masa at least once a week. It is by far the best sushi we have ever had. We have spent hundreds of dollars at sushi places in LA that couldn't hold a candle to Masa. The fish at Masa is always fresh. The portions are large (try the pineapple fried rice that is served in half of a carved out pineapple) and the service is GREAT!!!  It is always worth our money to go to Masa. Been dozens of times and we have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly beautifully decorated when we arrived around 10 pm for dinner.  It had a very clean, modern, romantic vibe to it and was elegantly lit. 

However, that might be why I was expecting more quality food. If it had been a typical dine-in looking environment, similar to many other Asian establishments located beside a grocery store that you would go and order a quick takeout dish from, I might have been ok with the lack of taste this food had.
My girlfriend had Pad Thai and couldn't take more than a few bites. I ate my entire plate of Yokisoba w/ chicken, so it wasn't horrible, but it was kind of plain and tasteless and just would rather eat at a typical buffet next time. It was all just bland. The sushi was good though. 

It isn't all bad though. Aside from the atmosphere, the pricing was decent enough for the quality.  The quantity of food far exceeds what you pay for and you'll be full and somewhat satisfied if you can tolerate the taste enough to eat it all. The staff was friendly.  The variety of food selection was probably the best thing about the place overall, and because of that, I would be willing to eat there again, in hopes of selecting a better dish.

Also, they don't open until 4 on Saturdays. This sucks for me. 

[Update: May 2015: I have been back again twice now to order the Philadelphia Sushi Roll, once taking it home. I don't know if they changed or not (or maybe it's my mood), but I will order sushi from here regularly and am updating the rating from two to three stars. Because of this, I might try their dishes again sometime soon just in case they've improved as well.]"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot rate how the food tastes at Masa. My fiancé and I went in tonight with a sushi craving. 25 minutes after we gave our order, the waitress returned asking if the ticket she was holding was ours and apologized for (what we finally realized was) not sending our order to the chef. A forgivable mistake, as I was a server for many years; however, after waiting another 30 minutes, watching all of the other tables in the restaurant begin and finish their meals, no water refills, and no visit from management, we decided that 1 hour was too long to wait for raw food. We won't go back, not because of the wait, but because of the no existence of customer service. We ended up eating dinner 2 later than planned at Harry's Tavern an Ayrsley, where the food and service was amazing. Sorry, but Masa needs to up their game.  The one star I gave is for the nice looking backsplash behind the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Masa in my opinion has some of the best sushi in Charlotte. I've yet to have a bad meal there & I go quite often. The service however is a different story. Some of the waitresses are fantastic, while others...not so much. Tonight for example we started out with a terrible waitress, I think her name was Hillary but i'm not sure because she never actually told us her name. She was very inattentive & honestly pretty rude when we did finally get her attention. Luckily they had a fantastic waitress, Hannah, that more than made up for her coworker's lack of ability. Fantastic food, hit or miss service quality."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service from the owner/manager. The young girls they employ have zero customer service skills. Sitting down and texting, eating subs and no respect for customers. The food is decent but the service makes it worth missing out on. 

2 stars for the smiling manager whom has been friendly the few times I have visited."}
{"text":"I hate to change this but... I seem to attract unusual things in my food. At other places I've gotten broken chicken bone shards (ouch) in burritos and fruit labels in stir fry.
Masa added the rather mundane bug to my list of unexpected food finds. At least it was the only bug I caught from there that day. 

Previous 5* review:
This place is amazing! Their sushi is always good and tastes fresh. There's nothing really stand out great about it but in the probably twenty times I've been, I've only had a couple mediocre experiences.
This is definitely my go to place for sushi in the Steel Creek area. Like another reviewer said, the dragon egg while on the more expensive side is excellent and worth it! Go during lunch and they have a really good deal on two sushi rolls, can't remember the cost but it's what I usually get."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Masa. I've never eaten inside the restaurant, but they deliver to my house. No where else nearby can you get good chinese food as well as sushi delivered. We order from here at least once every 2 weeks. Last night I called in an order and they warned me it would be around 40 minutes for delivery, but then showed up at the front door less than 20 minutes later! I would recommend this place for delivery to anyone in the Steele Creek area of Charlotte. They are very nice too!"}
{"text":"Oh man, what do I even say? I was nervous at first cause it seemed like it might end up being...you know...but god was I wrong! I love Masa, I wish I could eat there every day. I actually have miso soup and a salmon dream roll on its way to my apartment right now. And I can't wait.

Good service, very quick. Extremely good sushi, awesome quality and amazing items on the menu without being too overwhelming. Full bar, which is awesome. It's also never crowded which I love. I hate restaurants where I have to yell to talk to people. 

Such a great place. I love that I am walking distance."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's totally vegan friendly and she'll totally accommodate your needs .. The hostess is so charismatic and the place is in pretty good shape .. Small and quaint .. Clean and yummy .. Great prices and good service :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with pretty great sushi. Definitely a hidden gem within Steele Creek. Their menu has a good variety of options & they have great customer service."}
{"text":"Their sushi is some of the freshest and best tasting in the area...  We've normally gone for lunch and the service has been pretty attentive and friendly.  I got the Chicken, Pineapple, Fried Rice the other day and they bring it out in half of a pineapple!  It was delicious as well.  Oh and their VERY BEST roll is the Cherry Blossom!!!  YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've had in my life, but good enough that I'll come back again!  The service was pretty good thanks to a nice and attentive waitress.  Luckily, I noticed we got the good waitress as I saw there was another waitress that wasn't paying much attention to her tables.  We had a few of the specialty rolls as well as the Chinese doughnuts and the seaweed salad and all of them were pretty tasty.  The chef also was super nice and brought some of the plates out to us directly.

Be aware though, we went on a Friday night and found it pretty busy.  We only had to wait a few minutes to get an open booth, but I bet this place can get pretty crowded!"}
{"text":"Tonight was a very special evening. My daughter and I went on a Valentine's date. The staff at Masa made us feel like we were the only customers in the restaurant, as they always do with all of their customers. The sushi is by far the freshest and best tasting in Charlotte! It is also the best deal in Charlotte! The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming."}
{"text":"The food is good for a quick sushi night, but the service is just ridiculous. For a night where there are only 4 tables full, the two chicks (both look like hostesses rather than waitresses), clearly could care less about service. 

We started with hot sake, quick and dirty. An order of dumplings for an appetizer and three rolls. We waited 20 minutes before two of the rolls were served. After reminding the waitress/hostess that we ordered dumplings as an app and another roll, she apologized. 10 minutes later we got the dumplings. We never did get the third sushi roll!

At no point did anyone ask if we needed anything. Everytime i wanted something i had to yell at the chick to get her attention. 

I would give three stars if it were not for the service. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! You would never think a sushi place next to a BiLo would be sooooo good! The sushi was so fresh and they were willing to swap a few things around for my friend and I. We go the volcano roll and the cherry blossom but instead of tuna in the cherry blossom we got salmon. We couldn't decide which we like better! Then we decided to split the \"happy family\" dinner which had, chicken, beef, shrimp, and scallops with veggies! so much food for such a decent price. And the service was very friendly and fast! I found out they also deliver! SCORE! sushi delievered right to my house?! what could be better!"}
{"text":"So, what can I say? I'm a regular here and just now taking the time to review it. Bottom line: good sushi at a good price, and they deliver nearby.

I recommend the Hella Hot roll, if you're into spicy. The roll itself doesn't really pack heat, but the sauce it comes with could singe your eyebrows! It's my favorite, hands down. And their miso is pretty tasty too. If you want to get something weird and different, try the Dragon Egg. I always get takeout, so I can't really comment on the waitstaff, but the owner is very friendly and we are always pleased to see him.

I know there are a few comments about food poisoning, but of the 20 times I guess I've been there so far, neither myself nor my partner have had even a bit of trouble. Don't let those stories keep you from giving Masa a try!

EDIT: I have also tried a taste of their Chinese food as well. Here are the verdicts:

Tangerine Chicken - YUM, 5/5. Absolutely delicious. I've had it more than once and have found it to be consistently good. The chicken meat itself was good quality, the breading was perfectly crunchy (god, I despise soggy chicken), and the sauce was sweet and unique. I could tell it was freshly prepared. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. Love it. It has a \"hot & spicy\" logo next to it but totally isn't hot or spicy. (I've learned not to trust those at ANY Asian restaurant. I don't think I've ever encountered one that was actually true.) 

General Tso's Chicken - Meh, 3/5. Not much flavor. A little soggy. Really standard Chinese takeout fare."}
{"text":"I've done takeout here about 5 times. The food was always really good. My favorite items to get is the fried chicken wings and shrimp fried rice plate. The pork fried rice is pretty good too. Just remember if you do takeout, REMEMBER to ask the person ringing you up to give you soy sauce or whatever for your rice. They do not put soy sauce in your bag at all like other places. That's where the 4 stars instead of 5 come from."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. However the quality and service have declined. Not a spot I go to anymore. Sorry it just seems like they are cutting corners with some of the dishes and just not good anymore."}
{"text":"The owner made us feel very welcome. Allowed me to just get chicken as my meal instead of requiring me to get a bunch of sides. The sushi was amazing. I got the spider roll and it was out of this world. The service was very friendly and I loved his local business!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery,what a waste of money ! 
the delivery guy was knocking the door so hard and look mad, I was scared to open the door. So Rude! 
Pad thai taste nothing like it should be, it tastes like a combination of  fish sauce and ketchup,ew 
The sesame chicken has a slippery breading and they use dark meat ! I just threw it away ! Gross ! 
So disappointed!"}
{"text":"My first time dining in will be my last.  If you've been there, you know the dining area is fairly small (7 booths and 3 tables).  We arrived and there were 3 or 4 booths occupied and the rest empty.  We were seated and the hostess took our drink order.  So far, so good. It took a few minutes more than felt right for such a slow night, but the waitress came and took our order.  No drink yet.  We ordered sushi and chicken fried rice.  The sushi came quite quickly, still no drink.  Even after the hostess sat the sushi down and my 6 year old said, rather loudly \"Where are our drinks?\"  Still, no drinks. FINALLY,  about 15 minutes after we ordered our drinks, they arrived.  There was a half-hearted apology for drinks taking so long, but it was basically in passing.

Our experience is in line with the review from a few weeks ago regarding the terrible service.

Anyway, very slow service, sub par food and a wait staff that is in need of a lot of training.  

I'll not return to dine in. I'll pour my own drink at home, dial the number, and ask they deliver, which is usually within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I have been patient with this place at least twice. Third time is definitely NOT a charm. Placed an online order. It said it will be here within 45 to 65 mins. Called the restaurant to check on the order. The rudest lady answer the phone. Didn't ask for my name.. Just cut me off mid way to say all orders are sent out and she normally tell ppl it will take 1hr to 1hr and 15mins. I mentioned that it been longer than 1hr and 15mins.. Her response. Well it's gone. I don't have any bags here so I can't tell you if your order is here or not. I'm like you didn't even ask for my name to try and check... I am livid.. 
Their food help my craving for Chinese at time. And do provide sushi rolls to help me with my fix. But with soo many other Chinese restaurants in the area that delivers. I won't be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Love love not only is it sushi it's Chinese as well, and it's great so much better than fortune cookie 2 I lucked up in this place from this app because I wanted to change Chinese restaurants because I wasn't getting the proper treatment/service at fortune cookie however when I called Masa they knew exactly where I was didn't place me on hold to search for 30mins smh... I will recommend this restaurant to anyone because the food in great"}
{"text":"Delish and price spot on! Service was good. It was an off time after 2pm. Want to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. Always passed it but never orders until today. California rolls were good and surprisingly very reasonable. The restaurant itself is quaint, all small seating area with a sushi bar. I will definitely return and look forward to trying out more items on the menu. Besides sushi they also have a typical \"Chinese food\" menu."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We have ordered take out 2x and decided to actually dine in the last time we went. The inside is super clean and very modern. The food was excellent and the sushi was fresh. The chicken fried rice was some of the best I have ever had, as well as the general chicken. Both dine in and delivery have been great!"}
{"text":"Started off with the steamed Gozya and miso soup then had sushi. Overall good food and service. Very affordable."}
{"text":"I love Masa Sushi they give you free soup during lunch. I've always had a pleasant experience when I dine there and the sushi is bomb! Very fresh and dishing always come out piping hot!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the Mongolian beef was not good at all. It was like soup! Friendly staff, but worst Mongolian beef I've ever had."}
{"text":"Service is always great here. The food is always yummy. I usually order the pineapple chicken... Which is placed in a pineapple !"}
{"text":"Even though we moved away from Steele Creek, we continued to go back to Masa for take-out because we really enjoyed the reasonable priced and well-made sushi.  Over the past several visits, things have changed for the worse.

Each of the last 4 times we got take-out at Masa, they messed up the order.  Despite the fact that the receipt indicated the right things, the contents of the bag said otherwise.  This is a major disappointment when you're in a rush to get home only to find things missing or things you didn't even ask for.

We called each time and were given a discount on our next order, but I'd much rather have the right order to begin with.  One time and it's no big deal.  Even a second time, we can get over that.  But FOUR straight times with this.  Come on! 

Things have slipped in other areas too.  The hostesses don't seem to have too much of an idea what's going on and things seem very disorganized.  

The sushi itself continues to be pretty good, but it's just not worth all the other jazz you have to deal with to get it.  

There was a dog in the restaurant last night as well, and there was nothing to indicate that it was a service dog.  I think it just belonged to a customer and no one bothered to tell them that wasn't okay.  I love dogs but I have ZERO desire to go to a dog-friendly sushi bar.  

Things have deteriorated, it's showing in many facets.  Pretty bummed to say it, but we're done with making the trip to Masa."}
{"text":"Just going to be blunt. 

Don't go!

 They don't care about the customer. They are not in business for the right reasons.  Went in there for a take out order. While I am giving my order some lady from the back interrupts us and starts explaining to the girl how the register works. Never said excuse me. Never said hang on. Nothing, just starts talking.Going on for about a minute.... Stopping me for putting in my order. I explained to her that what she did was rude and awkward for both of us and started to walked out as she badgered me with four letter words. Sorry but while the customer is not always right there are times you need to stop and listen to them and apologize rather than run your mouth about how important you are. I got In my car and used my gas to drive to your restaurant to place an order to take back to my house....the way I see it I don't deserve to be put down or be badgered about asking you not to be rude to myself and the staff.

Never going back. This is not the first time I have had a bad time there. Something is wrong with that place and it's starting to show. It's a Gordon Ramsey Nightmare kind of place now. Not to mention is always slow and they always have more going on than taking care of the customer. Usually iPhones and Texting. The staff turn over there is high as well which should tell you something. That's more that a few times the service has been bad!

Also check the health code violations. Never a perfect score and a few B's. Restaurants should not be getting B's ever! Sushi restaurants should never get contamination issues with any food. 80's and low 90's are really really bad scores.

Food-contact surfaces: cleaned and sanitized
Food separated and protected
Time as a Public Health Control: procedures and records

So in summary they are mishandling food, the food that you eat. Not to mention the really bad customer service. Who knows what is going on back there with your food....the customer service is just the tip of the old iceberg.

{"text":"Delivery a few weeks ago. Nothing special at all except fast delivery. The rice tasted days old and the Kung pao chicken was not good at all. Veggies were large but way undercooked. I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"\"How about you mind your own business, it's not a fancy restaurant it's a small restaurant. Shut up, eat your food and move on. Be grateful that you have food to eat unlike other people in other countries!\"

\"No anger just showing you that you are ungrateful chick! Have a nice life bitch.\"

Wow, this is what I get for writing a review! Thanks Masa, these are your people! Is Sam O of Sanford the owner!!?? Cool, I have it all in writing!  It's called \"libel\"!"}
{"text":"I will never be going back to this place again!!  I only ordered soup and Pad Thai and my friend got some sushi.  My soup came out with their sushi shortly after ordering but had to wait over 25 mins for my pad thai and by this time my friend was done eating.  No apologys or anything from the owner/manager.  I asked for a to go box since my friend had already finished eating and the manager brought one to the table only to open it up after he was gone to find out the box had other food crumbs and stains, torn and stained black around the edges.  I called the waitress over and she apologized took the ditry box and placed it back under the cashwrap with the rest of the to go boxes and did not throw it away and gave me a new one from the back.  Good luck with your take out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find in the area. We have only had sushi here, but we have found that it is some of the better in the immediate area, and a reasonable price! The employees are always super friendly and service is usually prompt.
We normally come in during lunch (they have great sushi lunch specials), and their tuna and salmon is always good! We have tried several of their specialty rolls, and we have never been disappointed, either. They have some of the best hot and sour soup that we have found, in the area, as well. 
We have never tried anything other than their sushi, so we cannot give input on that.. But the sushi quality is some of the better that we have some across in the area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here and we liked the place. The roll prices are really reasonable, so we tried a bunch. Our favorite is probably the Sexy Salmon, but it was hard to pick.

It's a great place to go to if you feel like going out to eat but don't want to feel obligated to get dolled up. Great for a Tuesday night casual dinner or a long Saturday date night meal. It could easily go both ways.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"We really like Masa.  Pineapple fried rice is tasty, but we usually go for the 2 for $7 lunch special.  Sushi is not the most creative or even the best, but it is quality and great for this area (without driving into the city).  The owner is very kind and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Decent! Not the greatest location, but very well-decorated and cute (left over from previous MiWa restaurant here).  Sushi fish was very fresh, but presentation just needs a little bit of work. It's close, but maybe the sushi chef is newer to the craft.  
Everything was tasty, and service was speedy and pretty personal.  I felt like I could ask the owner or single server working for anything.  They should probably have more people working on busier nights (we ate there on a Sunday).  I saw a couple of women eating here by themselves.  The environment must feel friendly enough for that.  
Just a couple of ambience items...some music in the dining area would be great, and the big screen TV behind the sushi chef is such an eye sore!  This cute little place is too small for that.  Replace with art, or, Masa, if you must have the TV, play silent Japanese videos, movies, or TV!  
We will return."}
{"text":"I still continue to go to this place on a regular basis. The food still is always superb and the service there is impeccable. I've taken lots of different people there, and everyone has always loved it. If you're in this area of Charlotte, you should definitely check this place out. It's one of those hidden gems in a strip mall that you'll be happy you visited."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight and were really surprised at how good it was!  First off, I was impressed they had the Nigori unfiltered cold sake - my favorite.  We had a few rolls for an appetizer and they were fresh and nicely made.  We also had the pad Thai with beef (which actually has a tomato based sauce and was oddly good!).  The chow fun wide noodles with beef was awesome.  The beef in both was really tender and tasty.  Seriously good.  We'll be back for sure.  Did I mention the chow fun noodles?"}
{"text":"Great food. I recommend delivery. My experiences in the restaurant have been just so so and the alcohol selection isn't good."}
{"text":"Hey!! Finally some decent sushi in Charlotte. Went there for lunch before a grocery trip one day, and what a nice surprise for me to find this place!! I had a rainbow roll and a dim sum platter. Both of them were quite delicious, but the dim sum platter was all deep fried, which I didn't expect (or maybe next time I should read the menu more carefully). Anyway, it's a nice, casaul local place for sushi."}
{"text":"We have been ordering Masa delivery for almost 4 years now and we have always been satisfied with their yummy food and super friendly service. Delivery is always fast and our food comes hot and neatly packaged.  Personally, we love how they keep track of addresses so we do to have to give a ton of info every time we order and all the delivery drivers are always nice about our annoying barking dogs."}
{"text":"First off let me just say the staff is very friendly... But it was strike one when we walked in and it said Japanese but we got Chinese Menus lol... But then we ordered the coconut shrimp and it was VERY underwhelming, but I hop straight to strike 3 when the \"sushi\" came out along with our other food, let's just say nothing was authentic. Except the Asian workers. For $40 we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We have lived here for nearly 3 years and this used to be one of our favorite places around. Within the last year the service has been absolutely awful and the servers don't have a clue as to what they are doing. Then we did a take home order and noticed there sanitation rating was in the 70's yikes!!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT for delivery. Simple, basic, yummy Chinese food and sushi. Even though they say it will take 45 minutes almost everytime we call, it's gets here much quicker!"}
{"text":"The food here is always consistent and delicious. Wings are very good. Sushi were fresh w many selections to choose from. I prefer their spring rolls over their egg rolls and another appetizer worth trying is the fried calamari.

Also the customer service there is great and attentive."}
{"text":"So Masa is located in a plaza near Steele Creek. The restaurant is small and from the outside you would think it's just another take out Chinese Restaurant. Luckily with the recommendation of our friends we gave this place a chance. I'm so glad we did now it got me thinking so when's the next time we can come back again? That was my experience at least.

The price is really reasonable consideration we went there for dinner. We tried the dragon egg on the sushi list. Which is weird because it isn't your typical sushi but mannnnn is it goooood. Presentation and taste wise everything was awesome!! :D If you order fried rice it comes in a pineapple. AWESOME. 

We had two entrees, soup, sushi and it was just about $20."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The only downfall is probably the service provided here. We had to flag down the waitress every time we needed something. I would've gave it a four star despite the service. Had the volcano roll and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian Food in South Charlotte. The food here is fresh, flavorful, and non-greasy.  They pride themselves in always using the freshest ingredients; you can taste it in the quality of their food.  I always get the string beans and shrimp because they make the crunchiest string beans I've ever tasted - they're delicious! We also love their chicken with mixed vegetables, pork chow mein, sweet and sour soup, and wonton soup. Really, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. Great lunch menu with great prices.  Food came out really quick. Actually, a little too quick for me.  However,  food had good flavor.  I ordered chicken and shrimp with fried rice. Staff was friendly but never refilled my water or checked on me. And I was sitting in her direct view. Overall,  good food."}
{"text":"Take out was great! Our favorites: 
Garlic beef whit rice
Chow fun- beef or shrimp
And we also tried general tao chicken"}
{"text":"Still going to say this is our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte.  However, they have hired new waitstaff that is the absolute worst.  We waited and waited for service (place our order, get refills on drinks).  They sat in a booth across the restaurant talking to each other and to a friend that I guess stopped by to visit.  They stood around on their phones, and mind you the restaurant is small, but was rather busy.  Our drinks went empty, no refills, asked, waited, asked, waited.  They brought us our gyoza but forgot our ponzu sauce, asked for it, waited, asked for it waited.  Then we had finished our soups, apps, and so there were dished to be taken away, and they brought our first plate of sushi (not small) and then started to walk away, we called her back and asked her to clear the table of some of the dishes, she looked shocked, as if that is not a normal thing to ask, then took a couple of them away.  We wanted to order a few more rolls and she said she would come back, instead she sat across the small room chatting away.  We literally had to shout to get her attention, she looked annoyed.  I am not sure if there has been a  management change or an owner change, or just poor hiring.  They use to have great waitresses and the owner or manager would come around to ask if things were good.  Either way, I sure hope they change their staff choices, that is one of those things that can make or break an experience.  STILL, the sushi is amazing, and the sushi chefs deserve all of the credit for that."}
{"text":"Very good sushi

I have been there twice in the past two weeks, very good sushi, and friendly employees, the crunchy roll is a must!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi lover and this place is great!  It is nestled between a BiLo and a tanning salon (don't let that deter you).  The sushi is fresh-- the portions are huge and the lunch menu is very reasonably priced.  It is worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant for Chinese but the wait staff needs proper training. Some of the girls are nice but most are young and spend more time texting than they should. I order take out most of the time. The food is always delicious but the atmosphere isn't that great but its hard to beat the pricing. I would highly recommend the food but the staff needs proper training and management in order to get a five star review."}
{"text":"Two words: Maguro Madness. Is there anything better than a spicy tuna roll topped with tuna? Methinks not. During our last visit the madness was on with beautifully intense tuna on top. There were other sushi rolls but obviously there is a standout in my memory.

We tried several delicious rolls and split a couple bottles of sake. I would guess that they do a lot of take out business because after our two small bottles (you know the kind that are about the size of an enthusiastic wine pour) they were out of that brand of sake.

We've been a couple times now and while the service can be a little off, and there was that one time they lost our delivery order, overall this is a solid sushi spot in the Rivergate area."}
{"text":"Fairly average sushi in a part of town where there aren't many sushi options. My co-worker and I split the Cherry Blossom, Spicy Tuna, Crunchy, and another roll with jalepeno. We requested whole pieces of tuna instead of chopped and they obliged. They also offer your choice of two \"basic\"  rolls for $7.99 lunch special ...they are quite basic 1 ingredient rolls and to add something like avocado to the roll is a dollar upcharge. 

Overall I felt everything tasted fine- but nothing stood out. The service though friendly was very very slow - almost two hours for a sushi lunch. As far as its location - it is situated in a strip mall and isn't much to look at on the outside but the inside is just fine and appeared to be very clean. 

While I wouldn't go out of my way to return , I wouldn't write it off either."}
{"text":"First I'll start with ice ordered and sat in the restaurant to eat and never had a bad experience despite some colorful reviews I've seen.

A customer should never receive food with mold on it. I ordered delivery and when I opened the container for a sauce that comes with tempura I was SHOCKED to see fuzzy MOLD floating around in the sauce. 

To add insult to injury the manager offered a refund for only the tempura. I said to myself before calling if they refund the entire order I'll be ok if not I'm writing the review. So here it is. Agh!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite gem I have found in the Steele Creek area thus far. I am Asian (half Chinese to be specific) and when I am sick or not feeling 100%, my go-to comfort food is good 'ol Chinese food. 

I haven't had much luck finding a great authentic Chinese restaurant so I pretty much gave up looking (especially now that DimSum is closed). Recently, I felt particularly ill and didn't have the energy to cook or buy groceries so I googled and found this place. Because the name has the word \"Sushi\" in it, I came with the intention of just having a small Maki roll, maybe a soup and possibly some Soba noodles. What I found was so much more! 

My Takeaways: 

+ Hostesses here are SO nice and adorable. They greet you, courteous, check up on you, refill your drink, all the works! One did particularly well with a frustrated customer. Props to her
+ Sushi here is good AND priced amazingly. Dude. I had a spicy tuna roll for $4.50 at dinner. I KNOW. 
+ I thiiink majority of their business is via carryout so there is always seating available at all times and the atmosphere/ambiance inside is cute and simple! 
+ Menu has so much variety! Came here for sushi and soup and ended up getting a Happy Delight dish. Ugh, my favorite. Chicken, Scallops, HUGE Shrimp pieces with tons and tons of broccoli. You also get to choose between White Rice, Brown or Fried. Only $12.50 This ends up being my meal for another day and it still taste amazing. Came here another time with the goal of trying out a different dish.. Nope, it's just too perfect for me
+ Combos are available at all times for those who like that type of Chinese deal. Entree plus rice + spring/egg roll or soup. 

ProTip: Come here, treat yourself to a date, feel like you splurged but really saved on your wallet and enjoy some bomb food."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic from the moment I arrived,very friendly! Shrimp tempura and avocado rolls were tasty, came out quick. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW/RATING IS FOR THE DELIVERY GUY. Today my teenage son called me upset. I asked him what's wrong and he told me he ordered Sushi for him and his girlfriend from this restaurant. He told me they had it delivered to the house. When the guy got to the house and before the transaction was done the guy asked was he leaving a tip. After my son told him no (just for asking the way he did) this guy told him \"don't get delivery if your not going to tip\". First off you don't ask for tips! And if you feel compelled to do so at least wait till after someone does not tip you to ask, second my teenage son is in college full time and works part-time and does not have much money and third you don't TELL someone not to order delivery if your not gonna tip before you give them a chance too. I guess no one told this guy that tips are a courtesy and not a requirement. My son is a decent tipper for a teenager and we have taught him not to tip bad service. This review IS NOT for the restaurant, it's for the delivery guy who is an employee of the restaurant. My son called the restaurant and the lady he talked to expressed concern that this was said to a customer. She tried her best to make it right, but how right can you make it for an Ass! He likes the food here, he told me he will probably just go get the food from now on."}
{"text":"This is such a good place for me if I want sushi nearby. I've been here about four times and I have never been disappointed. Miso soup was pretty good. And all of the sushi rolls I have gotten have been really good and fresh. I always enjoy coming here. Recommend to any sushi lovers! Also, I went once with a friend and she got a a vegetarian option and she really enjoyed it! Don't remember the name though!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week for sushi. It is fresh, delicious and affordable. I generally stick with the basic rolls, the philly and the spicy tuna because I actually want to taste the fish....but every once I awhile I will get a specialty roll like the Salmon Dream Roll which was awesome. They always give a spicy mayo to go if you're picking up and don't charge extra for it. They also have a great sushi lunch roll combo."}
{"text":"I've eaten there once and have gotten delivery about 5 times. with a few exceptions, everything has been not just top notch in taste but the proportions are very generous! and to top it off the pricing is a very good value for the money. One night I ordered the Beef Pad-Thai and I swear I thought they made a mistake and sent me a family dinner it was so loaded with food!!  And no matter which part of the huge menu I ate from, it was either good or great! Sushi, sushi rolls, japanese Tempura or noodles. and of course all the chinese dishes - everything has been great. Oh and the best part of ordering from home - their delivery is really FAST. blows away any pizza delivery I ever had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is one of my fav and usual spots to dine at when I'm craving sushi! Absolutely love love love their sushi and food! It's super fresh and super tasty. I'm so glad to see that this restaurant has blossomed. I remember when they first opened and when they barely had any foot movement. This little hidden gem now has waits on a Friday evening for dinner service! I couldn't be any happier to support this local restaurant. The owner is such a sweetheart himself!"}
{"text":"Total hidden gem! They have a great variety of items on their menu and seem to do everything well!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi. Signature Roll is crazy good!"}
{"text":"We get delivery from Masa 1-2 times a week. The food is good, the service is very friendly and fast and the prices are good. Have not visited to eat inside but we love the delivery of both Chinese and sushi."}
{"text":"Bad sushi quality. We ordered to go and the presentation was exactly like the prepackaged rolls @ Harris Teeter. The rolls were horrible and SMALL especially for the price!! Never going back."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely delicious.  Their service is superb and the environment is clean and intimate.  Nothing but praises :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. Try Shrimp tempura and Singapore noodles."}
{"text":"Great quality of food and friendly staff. I'd recommend the Emperors Shrimp and fried rice. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today and had lunch.  Don't overlook this place just because it's outside appearance in a strip by an old grocery store.  I was impressed with the decor, thinking it would be a dive inside but it's actually nice.  It's small but has a clean feel.  The waitress was extremely helpful with my questions and accommodating as well. 

I am a vegetarian and I did not have the sushi but what I did have was fresh.  The ginger salad was typical to one you'd find at any Japanese place but had a slightly nicer feel to it with the presentation of color.  I will definitely go back to try more items."}
{"text":"This is my fav sushi spots in the Queen's city. The Volcano rolls are to die for, I seriously crave them all the time, living 3 hours away is no fun! The owner is such a sweet man! He always remembers us. We also love the house fried Garlic shrimp. Def give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am VERY picky about take-out Chinese/Asian food restaurants, and had completely given them up for many years  However, this place is legit: Clean/well kept, good quality food, decently priced."}
{"text":"This place is always a go to for sushi. The sushi is good!! Volcano roll is always perfect. Spring rolls are awesome. Friendly staff. Offer suggestions when undecided. I recommend for sure"}
{"text":"Typically not a fan of Asian food... MSG, trouble finding really fresh, worse trouble finding great flavour. Just ate here. I'm a fan now. They've got it all. ALMOST don't want to post this, place is such a gem and kind of hidden.  But the effort is SO there on their part, I've gotta do mine. YUM"}
{"text":"This is my go to place in the neighborhood if I want something Asian or for Sushi.  While it doesn't have the variety that some of the Uptown Sushi restaurants have, it does have a decent selection to appeal to different types of sushi lovers.  (I typically like mine flash friend and I love the Jewelry Box roll!)  It is nice to be able to have a good option without having to leave the neighborhood.   If I feel like having an entree as opposed to Sushi I am just as pleased.   The food doesn't leave me feeling bloated or greasy, while they give you a decent sized portion."}
{"text":"Gosh, I remember adding this business to Yelp when I was there the first time for a birthday party. I've been back a few times since then and I'm surprised that I haven't managed to write up a review.

Really good sushi with some creative and interesting offerings. I usually get four or five rolls as take out and there has yet to be a problem with anything missing. Plenty of chop sticks, enough soy sauce to float a boat and the sushi is always very well packed and prepared.

The seaweed salad is excellent. Or try the Dragon Egg.

They are located in the plaza between Five Guys and Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Their sushi is delicious!! This is a good take out place. Their sit-down service used to be lacking, but, they have really improved their service. I am impressed and sad I live so far away."}
{"text":"Servers were attentive and informative. We might have over-ordered, not knowing how large their sushi rolls would be. Two of their special rolls were certainly large enough for my fiancé and I to split for dinner, with an appetizer. 

The crab rangoon was pretty similar to what you can get anywhere else, but we really enjoyed our choices of sushi rolls. However, I was not a fan of the fried rice we ordered as a side, it was lacking on flavor. 

Note: the \"Hella Hot\" was actually not that spicy, but we usually like our food with a lot of kick.  

4/5 stars, I think we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Masa is an oasis in a vast sea of mediocre sushi. Though not the best sushi I've ever eaten (and I've eaten sushi in many states), I can definitely say that the sushi at Masa is made with care and respect for the ingredients. 

The rice is cooked well and seasoned perfectly. The fish is selected carefully and sliced neatly. And the sushi is crafted by chefs who understand their craft and who work to create culinary art. The portions are on the small side, but the prices reflect this. 

The non-sushi portion of the menu is acceptable. The tempura appetizer was a huge portion of shrimp and vegetables. The batter was a bit on the heavy side, but the dish was fine. The Chinese dishes were good but standard fare. 

Service was a bit rushed but again- this restaurant makes no pretenses to being a high end dining experience. 

Overall- if you are looking for good sushi, Masa is a good choice!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten there before but decided since we live close by I would order and pick up. I should know and have NEVER ordered Pad Thai from anywhere other than a Thai restaurant. I should have known when the hostess made it a point to state that theirs was different than a normal version when I picked it up. I also ordered fried rice. The pad thai was so bad, we wasted a container and most of another. I called 15 minutes later to restaurant to ask if I could exchange unused one for something we would eat or else we would throw it away. The restaurant was not willing to do so. The \"fried rice\" was also white in color. I will never eat here again. The worst food I have experienced in a very loongg time."}
