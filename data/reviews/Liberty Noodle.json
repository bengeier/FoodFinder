{"text":"I work in the area and so eat here fairly often.  I get the ginger beef noodle dish and usually like it.  The beef is different every time I go (ground, strips, chunks...) but it all tastes the same.  Only real complaint is how salty everything is!"}
{"text":"I live in Liberty Village and had passed by Liberty Noodle many times, but it was never open when we wanted to go.  I should note that my husband is noodle-obsessed...finally decided to try it on a Friday evening.   When we arrived, there was no hostess at the greeting desk...we waiting about 5 minutes before a girl showed up and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  It was evident that she was playing hostess, server, and busser for the whole restaurant.  The restaurant was very modern looking, with high ceilings and long benches.  We ordered a beer and the Ginger Lime Crush, which ended up being half a cup of pure ginger juice with some club soda and sugar thrown in.  It was undrinkable.  Oh, and the server played bartender as well.  My husband ordered a Sapporo...they were out of it.  He ordered a Kirin...also out.  Asahi...out.  So he settled on Heineken (it was that or a Corona). We (2 of us) ordered the chicken wings, black bean chicken, and Japanese beef curry.  Wings were panko-crusted, crispy, and good...five wings on the plate, with bottled sweet and sour dipping sauce. Beef curry was also surprisingly good, but seriously lacking in quantity!  3/4 of the plate was plain steamed rice, with maybe a half-cup of the curry on the side.  It was tasty enough that I wished there was more. The black bean chicken was tasteless, and no evidence of black bean on the plate.  Again, a TINY portion. Overall, poor value for quantity, sorely lacking service (though I can't blame the server for being overworked), and so-so food.  We both decided we wouldn't be returning, and stopped by Hero burger on the way home :)"}
{"text":"This is the best food court sesame beef noodle I had in a long while.  If you ever feel hungry at Eaton Center, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations, since it's in a food court, but I was so pleasantly surprised. I had the bacon kimchi fried rice. So flavorful; a great amount of spice! Can't wait to try something else on the menu the next time I'm at eaton centre!"}
{"text":"When I saw the menu from a far, it looked good so I went to purchase  the beef pho  noodles. The cashier girls were rude and not very friendly.....they don't  seem like they wanted to be working there today. ....I had bought the pho beef noodles   &a coke . ....fine I waited  and when I received  my order I the soup was warm, there were  only five slices of cooked beef in the noodles  and not enough  soup to cover the noodles  thus making the noodles  cold. Also I had noticed that I did not get my coke, so I went back to the cashier  and let them know that she had forgotten to get my drink order . .....the reaction that  I  got was she started  to roll her eyes   and said to get it my self which was in front of the cash register . ....I thought  shouldn't  she  tell me this when I was placing my order. Anyway not worth the money.....for $7.99 go to a real Vietnamese  pho restaurant  and will get a real bowl  of pho noodles  with lots more ingredients . ....will not go back again for sure......learned  my lesson"}
{"text":"Liberty Noodle is not the typical Asian restaurant. Their foods consist of more Westernized versions of Asian dishes  such as ramen, fried noodles and rice dishes. Knowing this, I pretty much lowered my expectations for them.  I dropped by their restaurant for dinner at around 9pm and got what I expected, unexciting normal food at an expensive price. I ordered the Spicy Beef Ramen where the noodles were undercooked and the broth was bland. It lacked flavour and was not spicy at all. My sister's fried noodle dish on the other hand tasted better but the serving portion was soooo small and it costed $10! (not worth it at all!). Their noodles were nothing special, it was almost like eating from a packaged noodle bowl. Regarding the atmosphere, the restaurant is huge with nice decor and the service is okay but I personally don't think they'll be around for a long time if they don't lower their prices and taste their food! As of right now, there is nothing that will convince me to return."}
{"text":"Incredibly salty! Ordered the Sesame Beef Udon Noodle Stir-fry... Will never come back again. A complete waste of money as it was inedible. Very pricey too."}
{"text":"My friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I got the chilli chicken udon. Her meal was bland, small and on top of that she got food poisoning.  My meal was also bland, not spicy at all and also super small portion.   Honestly, don't waste your time and get something else from the food court."}
{"text":"If you're here for authentic Asian food, then turn around, leave and hail a cab to Chinato... go to Markham.  If you're here to sit at a place with a nice atmosphere, aesthetically pleasing food, and to pay $10 for Mr. Noodles, voila you got it.  LibNood (as I affectionately call it) is a great place to go for the atmosphere but the food isn't something you can't make at home with a package of Mr. Noodles and stirfry-ing some veggies and meat and arranging it all nice on your plate.  With that being said.. I frequented LibNood quite a bit and really enjoy their Ginger Tofu Noodle dish."}
{"text":"Don't come here! The food is gross. There's a maggot in my noodle!!!! I am reporting it to the Dine Safe program run by Toronto Public Health."}
{"text":"I sent back my sesame beef noodle dish as it tasted like fish only to receive a second noodle dish (they selected it for me without giving me a choice) that was equally dissatisfying (overly sweet chilli chicken udon). The staff was condescending and did not believe me that the first dish tasted off, even to the point where the staff member tasted my noodles in front of me to see if the fish flavour was really there!  I will never eat here again, lesson learned!"}
{"text":"As a glutard, I'm always on the look-out for new gluten free lunch options, so I was  optimistic when I saw Liberty Noodle's menu proclaiming almost any menu item can be made 'gluten free'.  The cheery cashier confirmed that indeed the Chili Chicken I so desired can be made gluten free!  Well, be warned....most  dishes can be made with rice or rice noodles, but will still contain soy sauce. Cross-contamination in the kitchen is also a real possibility.  Hey Liberty Noodle, if you are going to  jump on the GFree band wagon, great---but then you have an obligation to be responsible.  Needless to say, I am having an uncomfortable afternoon."}
{"text":"Do not go here for lunch.   It took 30 minutes for me to get my order since they missed it and did not even apologize.  I ordered the spicy chicken lo mein ...it was average.  My sister ordered the beef bulgogi and it had a weird taste to it.  I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Today my partner and I were walking around Liberty Village and we noticed Liberty Noodle. I remembered reading a review and thought we should try it. It was really a nice space. The room had a lot of natural light, quite modern with a good mixture of booths and kind of big communal tables. Wasn't too busy as it was a Tuesday afternoon. It actually really reminded me of Wagamama in London.  The food reminded me of Wagamama too actually. It was decent, but I agree, it was not authentic. I wasn't really expecting it to be, so I wasn't really surprised. I had the Chili Beef Soup and she had the Tom Yum. We both liked our soups but weren't really crazy about them. The beef and the shrimp respectively were well cooked. She had a good amount of shrimp, I had an OK amount of beef. There wasn't enough ramen though. Also, usually, I drink all my broth, it's my favorite part - this time, I left the majority of it.  Although we didn't have any drinks, they looked like they had some interesting choices of cocktails, I remember some sort of spiked blueberry green tea.  Anyways, I would maybe go with a group of people who aren't very adventurous or maybe aren't used to authentic Asian flavours. Next time I'm in the mood for noodles, I think I'll just go to Kenzo."}
{"text":"Oh Liberty Noodle. I watched you in pre construction into those dark days when you had a window teaser that said 'get your noodle on' and thought 'wow, such a big space to fill when it fails'  Then you opened and i didn't heed to words of a few naysayers and vowed to try you myself and judge you harshly from first hand knowledge.   That was a while ago and honestly, I have yet to be dissapointed by you. Yes, your ramen can sometimes be a tad oily, but what's noodles without a little oil?   The flavours of most dishes are quite good save the basil chicken with rice noodles (the rice noodles lack flavour, I usually substitute with ramen). I love the crunchy apple slaw- refreshing and tart. But, if you don't like cilantro don't bother.  The bowls are delicious and the Ginger chicken broth is great when you are a bit under the weather.  The curry broth is the only one that I'm not particularly fond of, and I loves me some curry.    The staff are friendly and chatty, which is nice if you are a bit of a regular - it's nice to be recognized.   The atmosphere is busy and loud, but not uncomfortably so. You can still have a conversation, at a comfortable volume, with your friends or clients without need for screaming or texting each other from across the booth.  I find the teas to be a bit pricey @ $4-$6 a pot but that, I feel, is the only thing that is unreasonably priced. The gyoza can be less then piping hot sometimes but never worth complaining about.   Their online ordering is bar none the most hassle free process I've ever experienced.     Overall, I'm happy liberty noodle is doing well in such a big space an consistently churning out good, differentiated, lunch time and dinner fare."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5-3, but definitely a pleasant experience. If you want sushi instantly at the Eaton's Centre, buy some here. I tried the salmon rolls on a busy Tuesday evening and they were still pretty nice by the time it was dinner. The servers were wonderfully professional and the line was nice and short. Not the freshest in the world, but definitely not bad!"}
{"text":"Not coming back here ever again. Don't ever eat here again.  The food isn't the greatest and it's never consistent. The noodle was undercooked and lots of sauce that drenched the entire bowl.    The cashier was unfriendly and didn't say hello or thanks and their was a miscommunication with what I order. It was ridiculous how the cashier wanted me to pay for a new order when I realized the cashier misunderstood my order. Wanted noodles instead of rice and it cost the same price. The cashier was quite rude and defensive about it and demanded I pay for another meal. I explained that I wanted noodles instead of rice and there was a big fuss about making me noodles. I wasn't going to eat the rice and 15 mins later they eventually gave me noodles. There was a miscommunication with what I did or didn't order however it was the same price. I would have gladly paid extra if the noodles cost more  but if it was the same price it didn't make sense how the cashier demanded me to pay for another meal. Rude customer service and it was frustrating how the cashier got defensive and didn't apologize. Never coming to this place again."}
{"text":"LINE UP Ridiculous wait at 1:30pm.  20 minutes from the time I got in line to when I received my order.  Everything is made to order, but I don't see why they can't make 2 or 3 orders of something at once in the wok when several people are waiting for the same thing.  It wasn't a long wait because they are busy, it is because they are slow and disorganized.  It is rather hot standing in line.  I think their hoods are not strong enough to pull away the heat.  ALLERGY ALERT I told them specifically that I have a shrimp food allergy.  I did not get sick, and the cashier went over any seafood ingredients in the dish, but I questioned the person plating my food again since I watched the same wok just being rinsed (not washed with soap) in between food orders.  They could very well have one of the two woks dedicated to shellfish, but I want extreme allergy sufferers to be aware there is much higher risk here.  FOOD Bacon kimchee fried rice.  I loved it.  At first it just tasted like oil that was heated to high in a wok (you know like most food court chow mein), but then the flavors came through and I was hooked.  It was enough to be my entire lunch.  Sprinkled with edamame beans.  Though I can't figure out what pork product they were using because it wasn't bacon since there was no fat on it.  It was clearly cured pork because of the pink color but it wasn't ham.  Mmmmm. Mystery pork product.  I got their house made ginger lemonade.  Dang, that's a lot of fresh ginger.  I love fresh ginger but I think most people will find it too strong/sharp.  It was not too sweet, but it was not cold enough.  I hate their skinny coffee straws that sit in a box for everyone to put their paws on. I hope they'll get a proper straw dispenser with fatter straws that don't get clogged with ginger pulp.  Cost me $12 for the ginger lemonade and bacon kimchee fried rice.  That's alot for rice with so little protein!  They have combo options where you can add any side and beverage to just about anything.  I think sides are apple slaw, spring rolls, edamame...  They had a special to add on a California Roll for $1-2  Mostly Japanese food, but they have Vietnamese Pho and few Korean items.  They ave few fusion dishes.  HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE There is annoying switchback line up with ropes in the mall's food court which will frustrate those with mobility issues or wheelchairs.  Their cash register and most of their tray line are high, so it might be hard to communicate.  The pick up station at the end is very low though so little people and wheelchairs can easily pick up their own order.    The mall is well equipped with escalators and elevators to this lower level.  It is flat leading up to all eateries in this massive food court.  Plenty of seating where chairs pull out to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers.  They have washable plates and cutlery at this food court, so you have to take your tray to a station where mall staff scrape then wash it.  Unfortunately, these stations are VERY tall and I doubt someone in a wheelchair could pass their tray up to this cleaning counter."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like t his place. In it's defense the staff are very friendly and the service is quick. I ordered the \"spicy\" pad thai which is grossly mislabeled, it should be called \"mild\"pad thai. the rice noodles were all clumpy and stuck together and there wasn't  much flavour to it. However, the chicken and tofu tasted really fresh which was good and the prices are surprisingly reasonable. It certainly wasn't the worst choice I could have made in that foodcourt but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I tried the beef stir fry noodles. Usually when I think of stir fry i think moderate of juiciness in the noodles; however, the noodles I got were soaked with the sauce and the grease. The sauce is really heavy making it hard to really taste anything else but the sauce. I just wished that the noodles were lighter and had more flavor to it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and each time I leave feeling like I've been ripped off. The space itself is nice, but that's about all they've got going for them.   Noodle soups are unimpressive at best: a package of 10-cent ramen noodles thrown into a broth with some sparse uncooked vegetables will run you about $10 or more. Noodle and rice dishes are marginally better - stir fried veggies, meat and sauce - but nothing you couldn't throw together at home in 15 minutes or less. For the money they must be making on the ramen, you'd think they might at least offer complimentary green tea (as most other Asian restaurants are apt to do), but tea will run you about $3 extra.   Overall: the food isn't bad, but it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"The curry pad thai says it's \"liked\" on the menu. Stay away from it! Sauce tasted the ketchup. I couldn't taste any curry.  I'm willing to try something else there as maybe it was just a bad sauce... but by all means.. don't get the curry pad thai.."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken chili rice and it was greasy and boring. The sauce made everything wet, and I got tired of the flavour in about 2 bites. Many other places that would be better."}
{"text":"What a DISGUSTING place. I ordered the \"most liked\" Tonkotsu Pork Soup. Most liked by who I want to ask? The broth was not hot and the taste was vomit inducing, the egg (which is half the egg) is just a boiled egg, but since it's hard to make that wrong it was the only ok part of the soup. The ramen noodles were OLD and as a result had this strange smell and tasted awful. And the pork, boy was it dry and lacking any taste.    Had this horrible aftertaste for at least 5 minutes. Ewww. I wouldn't serve this to a kid who's about to die of hunger."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY- DON'T EAT HERE.  I have never written a yelp review but had to for Liberty Noodle- because it was just that bad. I got the sesame beef noodle stir fry (because they were sold out of everything else I tried to order). I took one bite, and it was SO GROSS. Soggy noodles soaked in very salty sauce. The meat tasted boiled and devoid of flavour. I tried to eat a bit more because it was such a waste, but realised forcing myself to eat it was the bigger waste.   In case you think I was expecting too much: I eat a lot at food courts, and that's all I expected. Honestly, this was like some kid over boiled some noodles and beef, then dumped a jar of cheap sauce on top. I wish I had read the reviews beforehand. Hopefully I can save someone else their money and disappointment."}
{"text":"The udon/ramen/pho fusion concept is pretty cool But the execution is not consistent. Some days the noodles are awesome, other days it's not.... Today for example, Mon 30 Jan 17, the beef pho with ramen was not so good"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I work in the mall so I walk by this place frequently during lunch.  There is always a line and the pictures look so good and well I thought...why not try it out?  Why not try something different.  I got the curry chicken pad thai.  It was horrible.  It was basically ketchup tossed with noodles and chicken.  Where is the curry?  It honestly just made me sad because I was hungry(borderline HANGRY) and well it was so disappointing.  Do not try if your hungry...actually don't try at all.  Just keep walking."}
{"text":"They get one star only because you have to give one to write a review.  The most disgusting spring rolls, miso soup and sushi (Dynamite roll) I have EVER tasted!! Ridiculously expensive-don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Their sushi is very underrated - its so good and so affordable. I've tried a lot of things from their menu and their chili chicken udon is my fav noodle stir fry. My fav noodle soup would be the beef pho, and my fav rice stir fry would be the bacon kimchi fried rice. Its a great asian fusion fast food restaurant. Nice service too, they make the food very fast compared to other restaurants in the eaton centre."}
{"text":"Had the beef pho noodle. As good as any others that I have eaten. The noodle was really soft and the soup tasty. The portion was good sized. When you collect the food, there are cups and jugs of ice water, so there is no need to pay for water for the meal"}
{"text":"I've had quite a few of the soup and stir fry dishes and they have been quite tasty overall. Great if you want a mid range lunch that is a notch above fast food. I'd recommend the sesame beef and the bacon kimchi fried rice in particular. Those seem to be the dishes people like the most."}
{"text":"I like it here. Its a great space, full of light, nicely laid out and the service is good. The appetizers are always delicious and the mains, well, it's a noodle shop. Nothing more. I felt like the tea was overpriced. The drinks look interesting though I haven't tried one yet. Actually, I think that the price for the mains is a bit high considering what it is we're eating. I like that the Feature Food specials constantly change. I always try to order from that menu when I can."}
{"text":"Pretty good for food court. Took a while to order but it's better than Thai express. Got the chilli beef, would wanna try their rice dishes.  For 9$ it is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Just horrid! Ordered beef chilli ramen that I just could not eat. You can see the food prep area and I should have took a hint as I saw they are chopping veggies without even washing them  ..."}
{"text":"This place is okay for a food court resto. There are plenty of options and it's actually cheaper than most in the Eaton Centre.   I haven't tried many items, but what I have tried is decent. Maybe a bit too much sodium.  The Good:   1. Fresh. Seems to be prepared fresh as they cook it in front of you. 2. Take-out. The to-go bowls are fantastic. Reusable for sure.  The Bad:  1. Health. Obviously an Asian food court option is not going to be good for you - unhealthy to the max! 2. Quality. Again, this is a food court place, so it's not going to taste as good as a sit down resto.  Recommendation: go for a cheap lunch but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR.  Seriously, do yourself a favour and don't go here. SERIOUSLYYYY! I've never been so serious about anything in my life. If you go, at least stay away from the chili chicken udon. SERIOUSLYY!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this was not the location at Liberty Village, but i assume same owner etc.. I was at the Eaton Centre's Urban Eatery and decided to try out the Liberty Noodle there. Now, I love noodles .... so much that I generally find it hard to screw up.  But this place was just not worth it! First of all, the service guy.. might have been the owner even, because he looked Arabic or something - was not very friendly (not rude though).  Nothing really said...not even thank you come again.  I ordered the noodle plate called Black Chicken Ramen.  It was weird - too sweet, too cold, hardly any hint or flavour of black bean, and they said on the menu \"with seasoned vegetables\", which was bok choy... I got one small piece of bok choy!!!  The cook had 2 orders for the black bean chicken noodles so he whipped up a big batch and just poured it half assed into 2 bowls.  The girl beside me got all the chicken - he didn't even care to separate it out fairly!!  On top of it, the price was 9 bucks and the portion was tiny as anything.  Sorry, but I will save my 9 bucks and just run back to Thai Express - much more standardized quality and better bang for the buck.  Also, I wonder where the ratings chart is on this business???  It is suppose to be present right away at the top!  I noticed most ratings were quite bad. A lot of 3 and quite a few 2 and 1 stars!!!!  I better not find out that Liberty Noodle paid to remove the chart at the beggining.  I will really start getting suspicious of Yelp."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, but actually pretty bad. On 2 separate occasions I had the Shoyu Ramen and the Curry Pad Thai. Both I would never order again. Shoyu Ramen was below average but ramen is hard so I decided to give it another shot. The Curry Pad Thai is horrific though and actually tastes nothing like curry btw. Probably won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"I was on break and craving sushi... I tried the dynamite rolls....so good ,and at a great price!"}
{"text":"Very average noodle place in the Eaton's Center food court. Came here for lunch last week.   I've had the ramen here as well as Pho. It's not really anything special but convient if you are at the Eaton's food court."}
{"text":"If you like Asian noodles even a little bit, do yourself a huge favour and don't waste your time or money at Liberty Noodle. I made the mistake of going here not once, but twice, and ordering the Tonkatsu Ramen since it was a cold day and I didn't feel like freezing my ass off down the street.  The broth was weak and the noodles tasted doughy and undercooked. Pork was weirdly dry in some places and very fatty and sloppy in others.  Then, forgetting this bad experience, I ordered the same thing again. When my memory kicked in, my heart sank as I remembered the unfortunate ramen I'd had before. Fool me once, shame on Liberty Noodle. Fool me twice... well, you get the idea.  Even if it happens to be cold, walk just a little bit further and get something decent, because the ramen here is very sub par and not worth staying indoors for.  Also annoyed that people leave their garbage and trays all over the place in this food court. Slobs! Pick up after yourself so that others don't have to!"}
{"text":"As a fast food joint, this is a more interesting choice in a food court. With a unique spin on asian fusion, this could have been a really cool place to revisit. Unfortunately, the food's taste did not live up to my expectations of their creativity.  I saw the Bacon and Kimchi Fried Rice and was immediately intrigued. I love bacon. And I love kimchi. This would have been an awesome bowl of rice, had the cooking of it been more specific. The bacon pieces were more like ham, which ended up losing the crispiness I would have expected. The fried rice itself was too wet for my liking, and if the fry cook had fried the rice just a couple minutes longer, it would have been drier and more enjoyable in my opinion.  The staff there were very friendly though, and moved quickly upon each order. However, the food definitely didn't live up to what I expected in my head. I guess I can always make this dish for myself at home with my own specifications, but that's the after-thought of eating it. Would I come back? Not sure... guess I'll see how I feel when I'm at the eatery next."}
{"text":"After my daughter and I arrived in Toronto we were famished..so after walking around the food court we decided on Liberty Noodle. I ordered the Tokontsu Soup and my daughter ordered the Garlic Chicken..we both were totally satisfied.I also ordered the Ginger Lemonade ....yeech!!! thought it would be a hint of ginger in it but someone put a piece of ginger in it the size of a pinky finger... way too much ginger..totally undrinkable! Anyway, my daughter loved her bowl of Garlic Chicken and I fell in love with my soup...the broth was so rich and flavorful..didn't particularly care for the seaweed...(minor)but the pork was seasoned well... the noodles were the right texture..even the egg was good. FAST FORWARD: After spending time in Toronto and Niagara...All I wanted was more soup from Liberty so my last meal in Toronto was? You guessed it....Tokotsu Soup... Well this time not so good...(sigh)The 1st time I bought it, it was a Thursday so if they made it early in the week the broth had time to marinate and get better with time as each day passes...some foods are like that so by Thursday the broth was outstanding.This time it was a Monday ...broth was a lot on the weak side as if they just made it ..nowhere as flavorful as the 1st one! The corn was tough and the pork meh...so disappointed! So would I go again if Im in Toronto?...Yes I would but only if it's the end of the week."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some co-workers and had to wait 40 minutes for 4 dishes. The server was great, he gave us the meal free.   Food was nothing special, I've had better ramen at Ajisen on Spadina."}
{"text":"Ok, this is a food court resto so straight up I'm not expecting fine dining, but it should at least be edible. I had no idea that a spring roll could taste that bad?! It was also hard as a rock. Bad start. My ginger chicken soup was also not very hot but the flavours were good, if not a bit bland. I added a packet of hot sauce and that improved it. Other than that, it was Ok - plenty of chicken, ramen noodles were hot and the veggies were fresh. Given it was only warm to begin with, it was stone cold before I could finish it. What a waste."}
{"text":"I always come to liberty noodle, all the way from Vaughan to eaton centre to eat the best beef pho. Today I order the same thing for me and my mom and we find our soup all red, dark and cloudy .  I've been having the same dish from that same place for months and it's always a clear beef broth. And that's even what the picture shows on the menu. Nothing should be different about it. Even the meat was very dry, overcooked dry. When I went back to ask the girl at the cashier and the one who prepared it, they were very rude and they just said beef pho is always like that!  I've never had a beef pho that bad. I'm disappointed in the quality of food as well as the service. Employees are rude"}
{"text":"DISSAPOINTMENT!!! All i can say is that I expected more from Liberty Noodle considering it is located in LIberty Village.  I enjoy Mildred's brunch. I am devoted to Raaw for sushi, but this was just a big dissapointment.  I'm trying hard not to be picky, because i know it's cheap. 10$ for the average dish, but I want quality and thats something they don't  have.  Nothing special and just don't expect anything. Just something that fills in your hunger.  VERY uncomfortable seating.  For all other yelpers, just head down to Kenzo on dundas."}
{"text":"I thought the ramen at Liberty Noodles was just OK; nothing amazing or fantastic about their ramen (and believe me, there's such a thing as addictive, amazing ramen.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/katana-ya-san-francisco#hrid:-v6KY5psonb4enjdly03TQ)  I wanted the Spicy Pork Ramen but it wasn't ready yet (at noon. hmmm), so i had the pork tonkatsu. Noodle texture was ok. soup was ok.  Was definitely on the pricier side in relation to the value of the dish  It wasn't bad. just not that great"}
{"text":"Went to eaton center to buy some Christmas presents. We were hungry so went to the food court to get something to eat and I'm craving for some noodle soups cause is cold outside.  Saw this place liberty noodle seems ok cause there is some peoples line up to buy food there. So I ordered the shrimp Tom Yum pho for like $10 something.  It only comes with 5 shrimps, noodles,mushroom and cilantro.  Noodles is too soft and soup doesn't taste like Tom Yum at all. This place is not recommend for any pho lovers. Eaton centre should find a better company to take over this stall so that people's don't get rip off."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!  They bring you in with their modern esthetic but the final outcome is, for lack of a better word, gross.  I ordered a noodle dish with ramen noods and sesame beef.  I received a huge bowl of food but it was basically noodles and a greasy sauce with tough pieces of beef.  I could not finish my meal because it was far too oily.  There are so many other GOOD options in the food court at Eaton's Centre.  AVOID."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst pad thai I've ever had. I wasn't expecting much. I knew I was in a food court and it wasn't going to be great, but it was SO flavourless, and the veggies and tofu were actually cold, despite me seeing the guy fry it all up in front of me.  I'm not really one to waste food, but I ate three bites and that was all I could do."}
{"text":"Ordered a ginger chicken soup noodle. It's the worst tasting noodle I've had in my life. I would give a zero or a negative if I can. I didn't expect much from a food court place but this is unbelievably disgusting. The soup tasted like water and the chicken tasted like card board. Honestly a three year old can make it better than them. I had to eat something else to rinse away the disgusting flavour this noodle soup left in my mouth. If you can't cook, don't open a restaurant and waste precious food. My advise: don't go there, not even if you're starving."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break from work and ordered take out.  The line-up was pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon but then again Eaton Center is always packed on weekends.  I would say the service here was mediocre since it is fast-food.  They have a wide variety of dishes that range from stir fry noodles, noodle soups, to rice stir-fry.  They also allow you to choose the type of noodles you would like.  They offer u-don noodles, rice noodles, or ramen noodles  I ended up ordering the Chili Beef Noodle Soup with U-Don, which is spicy miso soup with sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, scallions, and cilantro.  It was nothing special,  tasted like typical U-don noodles with a couple of pieces of beef and tons of vegetables, a whole lot of cilantro and green onions and noodles.  I liked it the spice that the miso soup had but other than that it was alright.  I wouldn't try it again.. Especially because the portion that you get for the price you pay, isn't worth the money nor did it fill me up at all."}
{"text":"Please do not eat here, eat anywhere else but here.  I ordered the stir fry chili chicken udon noodles and it was cooked so poorly.  It wasn't even cooked properly, undercooked, temperature was barely even warm.  I didn't notice the issue until I had got back to my office and not worth another 15 minutes to go back and get it done right.  I was the only customer there so there wasn't a rush to rush to cook my order so this was a clear case of the cook simply not caring enough and just to expedite his work.  The taste itself is bad, the sauce they cook the noodles in was sooooo sweet it tasted like it was sweet soup noodles.  This place is easily one of the worst in the food court here.  A colleague of mine informed me awhile back she had found a maggot in her food.  That should have been my red flag but human nature always lean to give second chances, but not thirds."}
{"text":"I got the Tom Yum Shrimp Noodle, the shrimps tasted like craps and I had to stop eating after maybe 10% into the meal. Why 2 stars instead of one? It's fast food in a food court after all....but still, it's the worst noodle I've had for a long time."}
{"text":"I would have given this 3 stars if it wasn't for the service. It just took too long to prepare ramen and our gyoza, especially since it was almost empty (Thursday 8:30pm)  It's true, it is cup of noodles in come broth. What gets me is that at least Kenzo and Ramen try to make authentic ramen (not 'noodles') and add all types of veggies and fixings.  Here they add only a few carrots (not cooked), been sprouts (not cooked) and same shitake mushrooms.   I got the chili beef noodles, and it included all of the above and some beef and chilli sauce. I felt like I could have made this at home.   The curry gyoza had barely any meat in it, nor did it taste anything like curry.   The $4 Mochi, was a small mochi from TNT cut in half. It was okay.  For $20 a person, (including tax) I would expect more. This shouldn't have cost so much either.   I was impressed with the event space on the other side of the west wall. It was big, and seemed like a nice place to hold something."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"most liked Tonkotsu Pork Soup\" with ramen noodles.   Let's see where do I start - the cashier who lied to me about the Gyoza that they were hot or the quality of the soup ingredients...I paid for the Gyoza, soup and a perrier ($16.90h and waited in line patiently while they made the soup.   I touched the stone cold dumplings - when I asked for a refund they said they would make more right now.  They had about 50 dumplings in a small deep fryer basket  - OMG I just know I'm not gonna like this - yup I was right - totally rock hard and underdone.   I know I've had soup here before and it was good - and today it was just OK. The quality of the ingredients were terrible.   The dumpling were horrible and the customer service was really bad.  No stars for customer service - two stars for food.   Not coming back here !!"}
{"text":"Eaton Center - Urban Eatery - I came here with high expectations because my coworker loves this place and says they have THE BEST noodles.  It must be the only place he's ever had noodles if that were true.  Don't get me wrong, the noodles are good, but can a food court place really have THE BEST of anything?    So first, come here without high expectations and you shouldn't be disappointed.  The noodles I've had here have been pretty good.  The ordering process is pretty simple.  You start with your choice of noodles - ramen, rice, or udon.  Then you pick how your want it prepared, in a soup or as a stir fry.  I've tried it 2 ways:  Shoyu Pork with ramen - I actually finished the whole thing!  This might not be a good sign for those with a normal stomach size since I feel like it may leave you hungry.  You better order an appetizer along with this dish.  Giner Chicken with rice noodles - The noodles were well cooked and this dish was loaded with meat and vegetables.  In addition to noodles, Liberty Noodle also offers rice dishes.  The average price is about $10, which is on par with the other places in this food court."}
{"text":"It was raining outside and we didn't want to walk in the rain to one of the many ramen shops around so we settled for Liberty Noodle. I wasn't expecting much to be honest, I just wanted to satisfy my ramen craving and this seemed like a quick fix.   I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen while my partner ordered the chilli chicken udon. The food was prepared really quick, within two minutes both orders were done and placed onto a lunch tray for us.   Both dishes came piping hot. The udon was pretty disappointing and had this really sweet taste to it. The ramen was okay, the broth wasn't salty and had decent amounts of pork belly (3 big slices) but the meat was on the tougher side.   Liberty Noodle is an okay choice but with amount of Ramen and Japanese restaurants within a two minute walking distance of Eaton Center, it's better go to one of those restaurants instead."}
{"text":"Returned to Liberty Noodle today and I'm happy to report that they seem to have settled into an acceptable stride.  The \"no free water\" fiasco was not repeated today.  I had to ask twice, but a big bottle of water showed up on the table without comment or issue.  The portions, freshness and quality of the food were all good.  Unlike our 1st attempt where the food was generally bland, this time there was a variety of flavours across the several dishes we tried.  To be fair, initially I was comparing LN to vietnamese places in the area and they're more of a Japanese-fusion noodle place.  For Japanese, their prices/value prop is about right.  I did baulk a bit at the $4 pricetag for a small pot of tea (even at the most expensive Japanese places, one can expect green tea comp'd, at least in my experience).  The noise issues are still there.  We arrived early and the place was reasonably quiet, but by 12:30 it was just plain loud.  I'm told that they are getting a few quotes for different solutions soon.  I think that good solutions can be had without affecting the decor or feel of the restaurant.  Because of my 1 star initial review, I cannot bring them (at this point) up to 4 stars, but they definitely seem \"A-OK\" now."}
{"text":"I normally shy away from eating in food courts and set my expectations low because of it, but I gotta say the general tso chicken was quite impressive and a large portion for about $9 after tax. Everything was cooked on demand, not sitting in steam trays which was nice.  If I had to eat in the food court again, I'd likely eat the General Tso Chicken over any of the other stuff being served up here, so yeah, I guess I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We decided to try liberty noodles because we were looking for some Japanese ramen. We ordered the tonkatsu pork noodle soup and shoyu noodle soup. The bowls were huge but we got less than half a bowl of soup, not to mention the way they just threw the broth in, it was dripping down the sides. Not a care in the world. It was hugely disappointing, in the bowl you get half of an egg, tons of corn and a few pieces of pork/ beef. The broth had almost no taste in the tonkatsu dish. Not happy with my meal especially since it cost $8.50 and was more expensive than the shoyu dish ($7.75) but had less flavour. Avoid this place at all costs, you can literally walk outside the mall down queen or yonge and find better ramen shops for a lot cheaper. It was an experience I will not repeat! 1/5"}
{"text":"We were at the mall and felt like having noodles.  My girlfriend in particular likes to eat pho and similar dishes quite often.  We decided to try Liberty Noodle.  There were only a few people in line, so I thought it would be fast.  It would appear that there are several process breakdowns - despite being  third or fourth in line, with eight people working, it took half an hour before we had our food.  Noodle soups don't take long to cook.    Given the amount of time that passed before we could even order, I decided to observe what was happening. - 1 dodgy looking guy was standing near the cashiers, not doing anything - 2 people were taking orders - 1 guy was chopping green onions in slow motion - words can't really convey how slowly he was doing this. - 1 person was mostly near the cash, but was walking back and forth between the cash and the food prep area.  I couldn't tell what they were doing - 2 people were assembling people's soups, noodles, etc. - 1 other person was working in the back food prep area.  The problem appears to be that they're simply disorganized with nobody leading the show.  Most of the people working there were just wandering around aimlessly or working very slowly.  Pho only takes a few minutes to prepare if the ingredients are ready, which they were.  On to the food.. We each had a Pho dish with pork.  They had slightly different descriptions on the menu.  They were a little bland, but my variation had more flavour that the one ordered by my girlfriend.  We shared a kimchi fried rice dish.  Overall, the kimchi rice was decent.  The noodle soup was barely passable.    With mediocre food, and slow service that can't be fully explained, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I do not recommend Liberty Noodles. I decided to try something new at Urban eatery and I regret it! The fast food joint seemed to be decently busy as there was a short lineup (not comparable to the lineups at the usual fast food establishments). While in line I saw their pre packaged gyozas and it was definitely a warning sign as those dumplings did not look appetizing- sadingly I missed the signal and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. When a menu item has a thumbs up and it looks like a noodle bar..you think they would  know how to cook decent noodles right?! Unfortunately not, my noodles were undercook and it was borderline inedible. The soup base was bland and boring and nothing like a good bowl of ramen. The condiments included bamboo, thin slices of cha siu, half an egg (not runny), seaweed and corn. By the sad looks of the bowl, it was lacking something.... For the price of this ramen, I would definitely just go and line up for Santouka, Sansotei, or Raijin in the area  Also to note, my fiancée ordered a spicy chicken udon stir fry and he said it was just alright but nothing special.  I know this is just fast food but I would have been so much happier with just a noodle soup bowl from the other Chinese fast food joints. Next time, we'll just stick with the regular places."}
{"text":"Comparatively cheaper than most of the other soups/noodles you can get in the Eaton Centre foodcourt.  We got a pork ramen and was surprised to find the broth in such a dark colour! The leeks seemed undercooked and too crunchy still, the broth was far too salty, and the meat was pretty much half fat."}
{"text":"I was worried to eat here with such mixed reviews but the Tom yum soup with shrimp was good. It had lots of cilantro and onion which I liked. The broth was good but could have had a tiny more depth. I should have asked for some lime or it should come with it automatically but besides that it was great for the price and quickness. They messed up my side order and gave me spicy edamame instead of salted but they let me keep the spicy one too which is a great gesture in my books. Will come back."}
{"text":"After a day of hard work (shopping), I decided I wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home.  This place is located on the lower level of the Eaton Centre food court.  Since it was pretty cold the day I was here I decided a nice hot soup would be perfect so I decided on the beef pho.  Per the menu board this is a customer favourite.   I'm not sure which customers they are talking about.  Maybe students?  It's like fast food asian fusion cuisine.  The broth lacks any depth of flavour and is pretty bland and a bit oily. I did get decent pieces of beef but that wasn't enough to save the dish.  It was reasonably priced for being in the Eaton Centre - my pho was about $7.50 and the portion was ok.  While it looks interesting to check out, next time I will check out something else in the food court."}
{"text":"No MSG added. No trans fats. No peanuts.  Notice they inserted the word \"added\"?    After reading that tag line on their menu board, I was even more skeptical at trying this place out as it's located at Eaton Centre's food court and amazing food isn't usually found in ANY food court.  With that acceptance and the fact that I actually have no beef with MSG, I braced myself for a one star experience.  My eyes being extremely hungry, I ordered the Tonkotsu Noodle combo with chili edamame and Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice with salted edamame.  What can I say, I couldn't decide!   The service was very friendly and quick - off to a good start.   Let's talk about the edamame, to chili or not to chili? Both side items consist of steamed edamame - the first one with a couple tablespoons of chili oil on top; the other, your standard traditional salt. The verdict? Salted wins this round for me; and even then, it's just salted edamame. The chili edamame was oily and nothing special. In fact, I found that with the chili oil, the edamame lost its addictive quality I love so much.  The Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice was surprisingly a little sweet with a hint of spice, random bits of bacon pieces and big chunks of cabbage.  I would've preferred the bacon to be crispy/crunchy but overall, the dish was ok. Wouldn't order it again, though.  Lastly, the Tonkotsu Pork Ramen.  The ramen noodles, though come prepackaged, was actually cooked right.  It had a decent chew to it and it's a step up from the packages you can make yourself.  The toppings were decent - it had bamboo shoots, corn, half a hard boiled egg, a few strips of seaweed, green onions and 3 strips of char siu pork.  I prefer my egg with the yolk still a little soft and runny for ramen but it's a food court dish - if Kenzo can't get it right, how I expect Liberty Noodle to? The char siu pork was seasoned well - it was soft, not quite as melt in your mouth as good, traditional char siu can be; but not bad either.  The broth had the right balance of salt and cream and it had that warming mmmm feeling you'd get with most ramen soup.  Don't be mistaken, it still lacked that traditional slaved-over-the-broth-for-almost-two-days taste but it was actually quite good - better than some of the ramen restaurants I've been disappointed with around the city so for food court ramen, I was pleasantly surprised!    You can count on me to come back in between shopping!"}
{"text":"This was not very good.  I ordered a pork shoyu ramen but it was all weird.  I'm pretty sure the pork was still cold.  They give new meaning to assembly line, I would only suggest eating here if you are starving because it was better than being hungry but not by much.  The noodles were weirdly chewy and the corn was hard somehow.  There wasn't one good thing about my meal except that it could borderline be considered food.  I don't recommend eating here like ever.   All the elements were weird and together it was still weird."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I decided to try this place.  I should have known better than to try ramen from a food court.  I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the broth tasted nothing like Tonkotsu at all.  Mainly all I tasted was an over use of ginger powder, as if they had accidentally dumped a whole bottle into the broth.  I did taste pork underneath all that ginger, but it was not the rich creamy taste that Tonkotsu should have. Instead, it was more like left over pork bones that had been boiled for only 20 min. I also had a side of vegetable gyoza that tasted like frozen ones from a supermarket. The only good thing I can say about this meal is that at least the ramen noodles were the right texture."}
{"text":"Came here because I was near the area and I thought that I might as well go to the food court to satisfy my craving of ramen as I was not willing to fully explore the downtown core prior to coming. In hindsight, I really should have just walked around and found something better than ramen from here.  If not for the fact that this is food court food and I am comparing it directly to other food court vendors, I would have given it literally one star.  However, due to the fact that it is a food court vendor and the fact that it was relatively late at night, I am trying to be lenient on the quality of service as well as the food itself.  Ramen was stuck together and not fully cooked or stirred properly, making the ramen lump up and become more of a blob of noodle than separate strands which created a great disappointment once I have noticed it.  Soup broth was too salty, however, not much can be said due to the fact this is usually the case with many ramen places.  Slices of pork, while they had 4-5 slices (quantity wise, at least it was not bad) tasted bland and seemed to have been placed after it was sitting for a couple of hours at room temperature.  The half egg that was placed came from a bucket that only had another half egg left with signs of it being there since the Dark Ages.    On a complete note, just a huge disappointment and I really wished that I just went almost anywhere else.  The new food court vendor hit me hard with great expectations, only to be met, by a greater disappointment.    Craving Ramen?.....go anywhere else, but here."}
{"text":"I was craving soup and stumbled upon this place.  Their sign says that the Ginger Chicken is one of the more \"liked\" ones.  I guess it just means most ordered.  It was basically chicken soup based, with wilted carrots and some veggies.    It's not disgusting or anything bad.  It's just as the rating goes for a 2 stars, \"I've experienced better.\"  I may try the fried noodles, but I won't be buying their Ginger Chicken again.  I mean, if you absolutely must have some sort of soup or else you'll turn into a zombie, then please, get them.  Aside from that, I'd suggest you try something else."}
{"text":"Not going back! No idea how much salt (or MSG that isn't 'added') is in their food, but I was left with a migraine and feeling incredibly irritable and unable to concentrate for nearly an hour after I'd eaten it. Should never have deviated from Urban Herbivore, which is my usual Eaton Centre go-to."}
{"text":"Did the manufacturers of Mr. Noodles expand to the restaurant business?  I swear this what I ate at  Liberty Noodle..."}
{"text":"I won't be going back.  I went over a lunch hour on March Break (2011)  and could not believe how slow the service was, even though the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  The sweet potato fries we ordered as an appetizer took forever to arrive, and were barely warm - so obviously they'd been sitting around the kitchen, ready to go, long before out server decided to bring them out to us.   Perhaps they'd have been good if they were hot.  As for the mains, I had a vegetable miso ramen soup and my husband and son had noodle plates - all dishes were 'meh'; neither good nor bad.  Okay but certainly nothing special.  The miso soup was huge; way too much food for one sitting.  The noodle plates were very small portions; my son and husband were still hungry even though we'd had an appetizer.  No impressed in any regard!"}
{"text":"I went to Liberty Noodle two days ago and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The portion wasn't impressive as it left me hungry and unsatisfied. The flavour was bland and the the pork didn't taste fresh. Within an hour after my meal, I was feeling nauseous and since then, I've been stuck at home with stomach issues. I wouldn't suggest eating here. There are many other choices in the food court."}
{"text":"I wanted to have some good asian cuisine, and chose this place because of the trendy appearance and nice outdoor patio to enjoy what was likely 2010's last summer day.   Not a very wise choice, their menu is not exactly what I was expecting - fusion is how they call food without identity, right? It's basically asian cuisine without spice. I had something that I would call a cole slaw teriaky - it was just ok - and edamame, and, you can't do edamame wrong.   Service was good. Place is incredibly clean and beautiful. I'd go back to see if the rest of the menu tastes better, but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Liberty Noodle many times now. As soon as you enter the restaurant, the words 'modern' and 'clean' come to mind. The staff is always super friendly and there is practically no wait time before you are seated.   The menu has a good variety of very flavourful meals with nice presentation. The portions are sized just right. I also really enjoy their selection of yummy teas.  When leaving Liberty Noodle, I come out with happy taste buds and a satisfied tummy :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! I placed my order (cashier asked me twice what I wanted) then waited 30 mins because she forgot to place the order!! I also got a miso soup with my meal which they poured too early so it was cold by the time I got my actual dish. Once I was finally able to eat my food I was hugely disappointed. The miso soup was too salty and the bacon kimchi stir fry had a weird smell to it. Don't go there. Save your money."}
{"text":"This is another one of those situations where I really do love the food, but the rating falls due to price, and even worse, price gouging.  I came here to treat a couple of coworkers to lunch.  The atmosphere looks trendy but I found the hard benches without backs to be uncomfortable.  I had the noodles and beef, and it really was tasty ... it did remind me of cheap packaged noodles but whatever they do to prepare it with the beef completely works.  For drinks, a couple of us ordered tea ... the green tea was good, but at $5 each it is pricey.  My two coworkers ordered the same beef dish as me but with rice instead of noodles, and the server never indicated there was a problem with that ... until we got the bill.  They charged an extra $7 each on top of the original price to substitute rice for noodles ... yes, that's an extra $14 for two servings of rice on top of what we were already paying for the meals.  I can understand that a restaurant might charge extra for substitutions, but I am completely baffled that they would charge such a huge markup without so much as a word ... not a good way to treat your customers.  I don't mind spending that on my two nice coworkers if we get value for what I have paid, and I didn't make a fuss about it to the restaurant because I had offered to pay, but we have never returned to Liberty Noodle again after that incident."}
{"text":"I really want to like Liberty Noodle.  I've tried them twice now, and ordered Shoyu Pork both times.  The broth is really tasty, if a little salty, and it's filled with fresh veggies and tender pork.  While not outstanding, it's definitely steps above your average mall food court fare.  If only it were served hot.  The first time, I actually went back and complained.  The manager took out a thermometer, opened the steaming pot of broth, and measured it.  Yes, it was hot!  Today I tried it again, hoping last time was a fluke.  I watched him ladle steaming hot broth from the pot.  However, I think the problem is that the rest of the ingredients are kept cold.  So they add cold veggies and pork to the steaming broth, and it cools it right off.  By the time my soup made it to the cash, there was no steam left.  So disappointing.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The worst ramen noodle I ever had. Since this is in food court, I didn't have high expectation. However I didn't realize it was that bad. I was surprised it was still in business base on here it has a huge Asian community. The food court is great nevertheless but this noodle house needs some work."}
{"text":"I wanted a healthy soup. And I love soups.   I asked what was ramen made of and the nice lady said egg. I then asked if any flour was used and she said 'no it's only egg'.   Over the dinner I looked this up online and couldn't find any 'only noodle and no flour' soup. I went back to clarify and she said that's all the staff are told and didn't have any more info as it was all egg only.   I asked if someone could call me and clarify, negative. So i was given a business card.   Is it that simple ? I am on a special diet where I can have rice but not wheat. Had I been informed that yes egg ramen has wheat I would have just gone for the rice noodles.   When I asked to speak to someone senior she said I should come back tmrw. (?)  Really, is that what customers are to do? First we got wrong info and then zero process to fix. Yes I was offered a refund or another meal, but I really doubt that's happening again.   Pretty crap, I'm sorry but this doesn't cut it for good guidelines or information or service."}
{"text":"For food courts, I don't expect much but I had better noodle dishes in other (Chinese) malls. I was initially interested since it was a new Asian noodle stall in the Urban Eatery other than Teriyaki and Thai Express, Shanghai 360 and Szechuan Express. Service is nothing spectacular. I gave it a few chances in four separate occasions in which I ordered the Japanese beef curry, Tonkotsu ramen (x2) and bacon udon carbonara.  The beef curry was pretty meh and a bit too mild, but still passable.  The Tonkotsu ramen noodles were nothing special but the broth felt too salty. For some reason, when I had the ramen again, I felt queasy for a few hours during the night. Luckily, that did not hold me back from watching X-Men: Days of Future Past in theatres then. If you want good ramen around Yonge-Dundas area, I would recommend Sansotei although the lines are long and the place is rather small.  I tried the udon out of curiosity but I was not impressed by the combination of udon, bacon, red cabbage, edaname, onions and Parmesan cheese sauce. Personally, I found the portion to be rather small and too salty. Felt that I could have spent my money on another meal, but sometimes you don't know until you try.  Interesting menu options, but I can't say the same about the final dishes. Needless to say, I would not return."}
{"text":"It's such a shame that the quality of the noodles here have gone south. It was perfect when it opened. With so many good quality ramen houses here in TO now, this noodle shop is sadly lacking in flavours for taste."}
{"text":"I would rather have instant noodles, if you don't believe me then try it for yourself... By far the worst soup noodle I have ever tried. Like soup was bland, noodle were undercooked, and every topping somehow found a way to let me down. God damn."}
{"text":"Liberty Noodle isn't just a new food place in Liberty Village - it's a refereshing change of pace for the area.   For those of you aren't familiar with the Neighbourhood, Liberty Village has a very high concentration of restaurants, eateries, and cafeterias that all cater to the 9-5'ers who work in the IT-heavy local. As a big fan of ramen and udon noodles, I had my eye on this place for months while they set up.  It was worth the wait! In the past two  weeks I've eaten at Liberty Noodle at least 4-5 times. Each time I've ordered a different dish. Each time I have been very happy with the meals. The prices are very reasonable, the presentation is pretty good, and the atmosphere is modern without being pretentious. I'm still waiting for the liquor license to come through (which is the only thing keeping me from giving a 5/5).  If you are looking for fair price with a great, relaxed feel, check this place out. Just be think of your co-workers before you grab the Garlic-garlic noodles (which are totally awesome by the way)."}
{"text":"First lets just point out we are eating in a food court mall. I was not expecting a five star meal. I needed to grab something fast to eat for dinner in my way to my hotel. I wanted something Asian inspired but not super greasy and deep fried. The cashier recommended the chilli chicken. I made it a combo with the apple slaw and vanilla soda. I liked the apple slaw it was light and refreshing and not too acidic. It had a great balance and not too much apple. My chilli chicken was good and very filling, I couldn't finish it. I added some Siracha and hoisin sauce for a little kick. I'd eat there again next time I'm at eaton centre."}
{"text":"Meh. Fast service but my stir fry was really really really salty and tasted nothing like bbq pork. Even hours after eating it, my mouth is still begging for water. Also it's expensive compared to what you get from other places around Eatons and Ryerson."}
{"text":"I've only been to the Eaton Centre Urban Eatery location. I'm not a connoisseur of Asian food by any means, so I suppose my review can't be trusted too much. I only ever get one meal: Ginger Chicken Soup with Udon instead of ramen and chicken gyoza. I love me some udon. This broth is good, though salty (but I haven't had much soup that isn't), and the chicken kinda tastes funky so I never really eat much of it (I'm super picky about my chicken). The gyoza are great, but then again, it's hard to screw up gyoza. So, I give it three stars, because when I'm at the Eaton Center, I go here for soup, and I'm generally pretty satisfied. Is there better in Toronto? Most def."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a client recently, and am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised.  I think, in part, this was due to some realistic expectations (thanks Yelpers!) and the fact that it was a super cold day and the hot soup noodles were just what I needed.  The most important point about Liberty Noodle, and this is neither a negative nor a positive, is that it is NOT Asian food.  Yes, it boasts Asian flavours, but there is no authenticity here; and to that point, I don't think it can even consider it Fusion.  Think of it as a place that boasts a creative use of Asian flavours and spice, with attentive service, and you and Liberty Noodle will get along just fine.  For my lunch, I think the appetizers really shined.  We started with the breaded and fried calamari and shrimp; the breading was light and fried just right, and the wasabi & coriander mayo dip was perfect (note: the wasabi flavor was barely noticeable, but I preferred it, actually).  I took the advice from a fellow Yelper and ordered the Apple Slaw salad - it was a star!  Crunchy, fresh, and the cilantro vinegarette tasted amazing!  The entrees were exactly as expected, but ultimately, nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Vegetable Miso Ramen.  It came hot and favourful - but, was neither Miso flavoured nor were the noodles the right Ramen consistency.  This is what I mean about the lack of authenticity; if you expected a real bowl of Japanese Ramen, you would be sorely disappointed - but, as a bowl of favourful soup noodles, I would say - go for it!  Given that the word \"Noodle\" is in the name, I feel the need to give Liberty Noodle one piece of advice, which is: change your noodle supplier.  Even if the noodles were cooked longer and more tender, whatever brand you are using doesn't seem to be made for soup noodles - frankly, it does your delicious broth a disservice.  My client ordered the beef curry on rice, which was flavourful, but the beef was cooked a bit tough.  I, myself, would try one of the rice dishes the next time I come.  I think the space is rather cute, very warehouse-chic, and our waitress couldn't have been more friendly or attentive.  We did arrive slightly early, in order to secure a seat, and when the lunch rush came, it did get quite lively and loud.  I wouldn't venture out specifically to eat here, but when in the neighbourhood, I'm happen to consider it a viable option."}
{"text":"Liberty Noodle is located inside Urban Eatery at Eaton Centre.  I was a little excited to try out some ramen or Pho noodle or Udon whatever Liberty Noodle want to call them Modern Japanese?!  Shoyu Pork Ramen ($7.50) was served with a lukewarm broth, maybe thinking the patron might burn themselves?? Ramen though cooked with a good bite. Aside from that, my bowl of ramen is just meh.  Beef Pho?? Chili Chicken Udon?   I just want a hot bowl of soup with noodle inside... is that too much to ask?!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch (takeout) and ordered the pork shoyu ramen. I was really surprised that from the moment I paid, I was able to pick up my order within 2-3 mins. The ramen itself wasn't really good though. The broth was very very salty and the noodles had a \"instant noodle\" feel to it. In fact, some instant ramens brands are even better. Only giving two stars to due the speed of the service"}
{"text":"The soup barely covered the ramen.  It was only half full. When I asked if they can add a little bit more soup, the girl told me I need to pay another $2!"}
{"text":"So I had the pho cravings at the Eating Centre. I see Liberrhea Noodles have the pho so I order. Doh meh. Basil leaf taste like the used tea leaf. Cow beef taste like the soggy dog brains. No spring onion. No soup base. This not the Viet style.  If you like the pho, Uncle Sam suggest the Chinatown one. So authentic you hear owners signing along to the Vietnamese musics."}
{"text":"This was the most DISGUSTING food I have ever eaten. FULL OF MSG!!!  I got the curry pad thai which was the only option that could make vegan. The chefs had no idea how to make it vegan even though their menu clearly stated that they could make most options vegan upon request.     Their website said that their food is healthy but it contains a horrific amount of MSG. I have a severe sensitivity to MSG so I became incredibly ill.   When I explained to the cashier that my meal was disgusting she did not do anything to rectify the situation.   WORST FOOD IN THE WHOLE FOOD COURT. NEVER GO THERE."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night, very quiet... only two other tables. Like others were saying, we also had to wait a bit before a waitress noticed and greeted us at their overly enormous greeting desk.   And like another reviewer had said.... a lot of their beers were out that night as well. Liberty is a Japanese beer, apparently.. but it was out! I had Stella.   I ordered the Hot and Sour Ramen. I've always like hot & sour stuff, but I know some places make it VERY spicy. The waitress said she could ask the kitchen to put in \"less spice.\" It was really good! I don't think it's the traditional one from Japan though haha, but still it was very very good and I really liked it :) :) I wouldn't mind going back for that.  My boyfriend had the Sesame Beef I think. He loved it A LOT.... I thought it tasted a little fake.. probably too much sesame sauce. But he liked it so okay!  Our waitress was alright. Other waiters were nicer when they came to collect our empty plates. They were smiling and etc :)   Overall, not too bad! $44 for our meal, I think... I snuck a look at the bill before my bf hid it. Not really worth the price, as the noodles weren't spectacular. But the place was nicely decorated and the washrooms were nicely decorated, and the waiters weren't too arrogant. 4 stars, sure!  p.s. There is Wi-fi!!!! ----big plus! And there's an elevator for wheel chair accessibility. Also a big plus :)!"}
