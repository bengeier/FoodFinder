{"text":"I was early at a doctors appointment and went in for something to eat. The woman was vibrant and funny. I sat with my back near the warm window while I ate. I normally am not fond of normal bacon and eggs breakfast but this was out of this world. I then go to pay and realize I don't have my bank card on me and they don't take credit cards. Well, it sort of turned into a joke and I left to pick up some money at home. It made my day."}
{"text":"Great local greasy spoon run by brothers Sleva and Kumar. Servers Helene and others make this a great place. Pizza, burgers, sandwiches, steaks, souvlaki, fish'n'chips  choice is endless."}
{"text":"One of the best small restaurants I've ever been to. Their breakfasts are amazing, and the rest of their food is delicious!  Been a favorite of mine since childhood. A nice small corner place. 

It can be a bit \"grungy\" though."}
{"text":"I'm kinda confused at the name because I don't think they serve pizza or submarines. They do have pasta though. Their prices are great and the food is quite good too. Only issue is, everytime I've gone, the place seems to be polluted with old drunkards reeking of cigarettes."}
