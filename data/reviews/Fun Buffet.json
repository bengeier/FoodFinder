{"text":"Not a fan. I have been taken here by others who are fans of buffets, as I am admittedly do not seek out buffets of my own volition. Freshness seems to be lacking... the times I have sampled from the fresh fruit area I have often encountered warm, overly-ripe (or even rotting) pineapple and strawberries. I do appreciate that they offer a stir-fry option, but unfortunately the chefs cook the fresh vegetables in heaping spoonfuls of butter. My arteries hurt just thinking about this place.  If you are seeking deep fried, greasy meat dishes covered in overly sweet sauces, this buffet may be much more to your liking."}
{"text":"We came here foolishly based on the amount of cars in the parking lot. We're from out of town, and didn't realize no one has taste buds around these parts. Food was old, half the items were empty, and the sushi was very ordinary and not great. The service was also as crappy as the toilets. We have an amazing Chinese buffet not far from where we live, and if these people think this is good, they'd WEEP over truly good Chinese food. We're truly dreading our choice and are wondering if we should buy Pepto Bismol and Immodium on the way home. Not recommended. Ever. Next time,  we will be sure to avoid this place. Fun Buffet? Not even once."}
{"text":"If there is less than one star, I would give to their restaurant. I have been to many Chinese restaurants, but I never see a dirty place like this. All the staff are VERY rude. They make you feel that you are begging them to eat at their restaurant. I will not go there never."}
{"text":"Lunch time is quite cheap especially with student ID. I think it's under $7. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Plenty of variety, and surprisingly good sushi for a buffet. The staff was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and the food was fresh enough. If you're a fan of crab legs and sushi, this place is an excellent value.   Is this place as nice as a Made-to-order gourmet restaurant? No, but it isn't trying to be. I think most of the negative reviews here are from people who expected it to be more than it is. As far as All-you-can-eat Chinese buffets go, this place is definitely above average in all categories!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, and I often frequent Chinese buffets.  This buffet has a very wide selection of the usual Chinese items (e.g., General Tso's chicken, stir-fry, lo mein, mei fun, etc.), but also lots of items which are typically only found at buffets (e.g., Peanut Butter Chicken).  Included with the buffet is a full sushi bar with a variety of different kinds of sushi (e.g., Philadelphia roll, california roll, spicy tuna, etc.).  Additionally, they have a hibachi stir fry area where you can create your own stir fry and they will cook it to order on the spot (this is also included with the buffet price).    I love the food, and in general I'm satisfied with the quality for a buffet.  I've never had food taste bland or be cold.  The sushi is great, and the few times I've made a stir fry I've been pleased with the result.  My only possible criticism is that the dessert options are a bit lacking, but I usually am so stuffed from all the buffet food that I can't manage dessert anyways.  The food is delicious and the lunch price cannot be beaten (around $7).  The dinner menu contains the same items (to my knowledge) and costs around $12."}
{"text":"Better than the average rating on yelp. Saturday night food was very fresh, flavorful and well maintained. Service was excellent. For a very busy time they were prepared for the crowd. One of the best buffets I have been to."}
{"text":"The cashier should not worry about if someone is gay or straight! I went one time with a friend of mine and she asked if I was gay and then said something to a waitress standing there and they both looked at us and started laughing."}
{"text":"Wow. Can I just say I'm shocked at the poor reviews this place has gotten?  Now today was the first time I've been there, so maybe I just caught it on an exceptionally good day, but here's the skinny.  Pros: Very clean Friendly and attentive servers Food is constantly restocked Cheap (like $12 per person) DELICIOUS SUSHI AND SEAFOOD!  Cons:  It was kinda crowded around 6pm Friday The extra napkins are really pathetic and hard to wipe your hands on  I eat sushi in Quincy, an asian suburb of Boston all the time--so I know what I'm saying when I say I ate this sushi with no fear (looked fresh) and it tasted pretty good. (Not the best, but it's a buffet... c'mon now). The selling point for me was the delicious seafood: crablegs, oysters, crayfish, shrimp, and more. I loved this place. Second best Chinese buffet I think I've ever been to--and i've been to A LOT.  I give this place a solid A! Will be eating here again"}
{"text":"Food used to be better, very limited menu now, I had a habachi just now, it was filled with old sour crab meat, disgusting."}
{"text":"Chinese food here is very average. And there's nothing spectacular about any other dishes. There's also nothing terribly wrong with any of their dishes either. Given the lack of options in this area you might as well go if you're in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is surprisingly good. Especially for a buffet. I try to go at least once a week. They've got really good spicy chicken also. I would drive clear across the county to go there."}
{"text":"Oh, dear... This place is just a train wreck. My husband recently said his district manager and regional manager come here to eat every time they're in town. I now know my husband works for a couple of crackheads because this place is awful.   First, the buffet does look clean and well attended. Their signage of what is in each dish is awful though. My two favorites were the pizza rolls sign that had shrimp underneath and the fried dumplings sign that had things that clearly resembled an animal's leg underneath that. Scary. So, we filled our plates...   The sushi tasted like it'd been there a while but there is a guy near there making fresh rolls so who knows. I did like my crab rangoon and wonton soup but that was pretty much it. My husband had a heaping pile of random meat and he described much of it as gross or on the low side of \"eh\". I ended up with a second plate of just crab rangoon... Their service was attentive...their only saving grace.   Streetsboro is not known for its culinary scene and this place lives up to it."}
{"text":"Came around 5pm and the place was near empty.  The staff was friendly and the buffet was well stocked and often tended to.  Food tasted just like any other buffet I have been to.  The buffet price was $11.99 with the soda being $1.75."}
{"text":"Totally not like it used to be !!! We went there today and all of the food is very different. Bland I used to live the peanut butter chicken, it did not taste like it used to be. We asked the front desk if they got a new cook they said yes, well me and my family are there and I believe we have food poisoning all of my family got sick today with stomach cramps and my friend even threw up. FUN is not FUN anymore!!!"}
{"text":"I generally don't go to buffets. They are usually gross and they generally suck.  When I lived in Kent, the Schwebel Room at the student center had a Sunday brunch buffet. All of the hospitality students that were failing would have to work on Sunday. Some D student would be carving Prime Rib, another no account would be practicing his crepe technique at another station. The made to order omeletes were awesome. That was a great buffet. Now I only go to buffets if I'm starving and in a hurry. I found myself in this very predicament one day as I was traveling through Streetsboro. I consulted my yelp app and saw fun buffet pop up. I perused the two reviews and after reading Susan C's review I had to go. I fully expected to see flies circling number 10 cans of La Choy that were being heated with sterno candles. Not the case. Susan's call to the health department must of shaken things up. The food was at a safe temperature, the problem is that it's that gooey sugary style of Chinese food. They have chicken cutlets covered in melted creamy peanut butter. It's actually better than it sounds. I would never order it on purpose. They have a Mongolian BBQ that is manned by the guy who is rolling out the buffet sushi. It has shrimp chicken and beef slices packed seperately in ice along side onion,noodles,jalapenos and mushrooms... You just pick out what you would like, throw a scoop of garlic on top and hand it over. The cook throws it on a flat top and walks away. Five minutes later he returns flips it onto a plate and hands it over. Best thing there. This isn't the greatest food, but I don't think you will contract hepatitis or require dialysis after eating here."}
{"text":"Great value.  Loved the fruit!  They even had vegan sushi, and you could have food custom made.  Our waitress was perfect.  I really loved it that they had seaweed on the buffet!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to get some buffet to go.. price was good for 4.99/lb but the selection was very limited. Especially for the desserts.  The place was dead on a wednesday evening...   don't think I would try it again. The food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Nothing says yummy like a full color food service poster advertising crappy pseudo sheet cakes... complete with case count of slices.  Crab, oysters, and peel your own shrimp were all on ice... but the \"melted butter\" container was just sitting on the counter... not really sure what it was... colored oil? Did not risk it.  Shu Mai was average commercial and the glow in the dark red teriyaki chicken stick was moist... but other than that not much that I would want to even think about eating. Everything else on the 2 hot buffets was either dried out or lost in huge amounts of fried breading.  Hubbie decided to try the \"hibachi\" station... not really sure if it was a flat top, wok, or some other Mongolian heating contraption because the \"chef\" took his plate, disappeared into the back, and did not return for 10 min!  There were 7 or 8 large parties and a couple of couples... only the table of Asian speaking people got any attention. the staff jumped each time they pointed out an empty tray of food... the rest of the dining room was lucky to get their plates picked up.  Several other oriental buffet options within an easy drive with more selection, friendlier staff, and identifiable food."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve even a single star.  Think of the worst chain Chinese food restaurant (i.e Panda Express) you've ever been to, and take away 80% of the taste, and that's what you have here.  General Tso's Chicken? Hard little chicken nuggets in a peculiarly-flavored sweet glaze, with no hot spice at all.  Anything advertised as having \"crab\" in it had something in it that was obviously not crab.  Dim Sum? Tasted a lot like Hamburger Helper.  I won't bore you with the rest, but suffice it to say that it was all brutal and miserable. I've had better food in a hospital bed.  All the vegetables in every dish just looked tired, and tasted awful. The glass of ice water provided by the wait staff had a strong taste of chlorine. The fried rice was overcooked and hard.  Run, don't walk away from this place."}
{"text":"My Wife and I really like this buffet style Chinese Restaurant for lunch.  With salmon, dim sum, coconut shrimp, fried rice, and several soups as my favorites, you can fill multiple plates till your ready for dessert.  Eat a little or a lot, it's up to you.  But at $7.50 pp, I think it's a bargain.   Some of the harsh reviews surprise me, but give them a try."}
{"text":"My family dined here recently and it wasn't too bad. My expectations were relatively low, it's a buffet NOT the French Laundry.  I was expecting it to be clean and reasonable prices; and it was.  The food, that I had, tasted good but I didn't have crab legs or anything really exotic. The roast beef wasn't bad, the same with the sushi rolls and all the Chinese food was what you'd expect.  Was the quality amazing? Not really but its a buffet ! Also, my expectations were not sky-high.   If you have a desire for a bite of different types of  Chinese, and Japanese food this isn't a bad place to go."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful buffet dinner this Friday evening!  What a big selection of some very delicious dishes.  Great selections, and everything was quite fresh, as we were there at dinner time.  We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised!  My boyfriend and I had driven past this place multiple times and joked about how one day we would be brave enough to try an oriental buffet in Streetsboro. Well, one day we were.  The restaurant is very clean first of all. I mean, you could've eaten your food off of the floor. The staff barely spoke English but were attentive and eager to please. The food choices ranged from pizza to sushi and we sampled a little bit of everything. It was all fresh, hot and flavorful.   For a buffet right off of the turnpike we were surprised at its over all quality and environment. We have been there twice, one of those times being with our children who have hard-to-please palates. You will get your money's-worth and leave with a full stomach."}
{"text":"First visit in over two months, and I don't know why I go back. Food is always cold. I visited at 3:15 pm today, and I think the food was all left over from lunch. The shrimp was like shoe leather. The only thing that was hot was the rice noodles. Even the fortune cookie was stale. So many repairs are needed to the building and decor."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday close to 2pm. The food was fresh and for a buffet very tasty.  Usually I eat more items at a buffet that are just average or below average but the Fun Buffet had quite a few items that I felt were very good. I actually didn't eat anything that was below average, most were above average in taste.  I recommend this place if in the area for a buffet. A pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Stop in and have the time of your life at the FUN BUFFET !!   What could be more fun than filling up numerous plates of your favorite \"Americanized\" Asian cuisine over and over and over again?  As far as Asian feeding troughs go this place is better than most  for food selection, price and  great sushi spread. The Sushi selection is probably the best for a buffet style in this price range. The sushi is cut in nice bite size portions so you're not trying to force a burger sized chunk of rolled  up rice into your face.   I go during work for lunch so it can be busier around that time 12 -1 pm  but we're able to get in and out pretty fast and  be right back to work where we fall into a deep food induced coma.  They also have a take out, you pay by the LB, not the LB's you'll be putting on , they weigh the container !!  I give it 4 stars for consistency and value for the money but be realistic here folks, its a Chinese Buffet  not the Waldorf so go in with the right expectations and leave with a full tummy and wallet."}
{"text":"My wife and I went yesterday around 6:30 - 7:00pm. It was the usual amount of busy however they sat us at the far end of the restaurant in a cozy booth not far from the buffet. After a brisk urination and a wash of the hands, in a more than adequate and relatively tidy bathroom, I was greeted at the booth with a hot pot of tea. From there my wife and I proceeded to the Sushi bar where the delightful array of various sushi's were laid out neatly and organized. My first plate was overflowing with at least one of each type of sushi they had to offer. The convenience of separate soy sauce bowls and a plethora of sides to compliment the sushi was a nice touch. However, my wife did note that the labeling for the sushi was rather sub-par. We tucked into our first course at our cozy booth and the sushi was of a quality you would not expect from a small town Chinese buffet. The craftsmanship, care, and quality of the sushi was not what you would get from a made to order sushi restaurant; however the quantity of decent sushi was the real bargain and the hero of the dinner. From there we continued our onslaught of the buffet. My second trip was a cup of won-ton soup with a smaller plate of common favorites. Items included General Tso's chicken, Pepper Steak, Crab Rangoon, sweet and sour pork, and also fried rice. I couldn't return to the table however without a few more pieces of sushi adorning the perimeter of my plate where I had strategically left small gaps for said sushi. Course two was quite delectable and mentally confirmed what a bargain the Fun Buffet truly was. As I ate, I contemplated whether or not it was always this good. I had not visited the Fun Buffet in many years and such legends as this restaurant only come to be over the passing of time and the unfamiliarity of its true demeanor. This was not the case however, this legend did not grow in my mind because of a false recollection over time. This was truly a great feast for a great bargain. As my wife and I finished our variety plate, we sat a moment to digest and discuss matters of the day. After some time a third course was calling to me. I had some unfinished business to attend to. On my trip to the buffet I did one lap around to secure a game plan for the final morsels I would choose to indulge in. As always a few more pieces or sushi made it onto my plate with a sprinkling of random sides such as crab Rangoon and a random fried cheese stick that peaked my curiosity. I returned, and while finishing the final plate the prompt and attentive waitress kindly left our check and provided us with the customary fortune cookies. My wife and I continued on in our conversations and once satisfied with our meal, tore into the fortune cookies to reveal our innermost truths. As expected, our fortune cookies were even insightful and provided more than the average irrelevant anecdote you would find in a \"normal\" fortune cookie. We proceeded to the counter to check out after our fulfilling meal where a prompt and somewhat uninterested cashier took our receipt, applied our $2 off coupon and sent us on our way without fuss. In total our experience cost us just under $30 including an 18% tip. All in all this was a fun experience at the Fun Buffet. Anyone who doesn't rate this restaurant a 5/5 on Yelp is dead to me. Good day."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Selection is very limited, and the food was very bland for $12 pp. The sushi was questionable, but not awful. I don't recommend this place if you want a good Chinese buffet. I won't be returning..."}
{"text":"This place is the worst and most expensive Buffett in the area. Their food is cold, soggy. I watched the guy come from the back holding chicken wings in his hands and just dropped them in the tray like he was feeding pigs!!! No one came to the hibachi area after my daughter stood there for damn near 15 minutes even after she asked for help. Their selection is the worst I've ever seen. If you want to waste your time and money and end the evening on the crapbox definitely try this place out. And while your sitting there think of all the other places you could have spent 62.00 on for a family of 4 to enjoy a meal!!! Don't go to this place, the positive reviews you read are LYING!!!"}
{"text":"I truly do not understand why they call this place \"Fun Buffet\". The people who work here are far from happy. Food is not anything special. I will not come here again. I would be able to handle the rude staff if the food was good but that is not the case."}
{"text":"Husband and I was there yesterday. I wanted there oysters on the half shell. Guess what They didn't have them. The one waitess told me to expensive. Well to me strike one! Another most of the food was cold and tasteless. Crab legs over done . Service ok. Not many people there. We won't be coming back. Denise R."}
{"text":"We have been to Fun Buffet numerous times over the past few years. Last night was our final visit. The food quality is poor. The sushi used to be decent. Now, a piece fits in a teaspoon. We decided to go for Mother's Day and found they had raised the price to $15.49 per person. I got some of the Mongolian BBQ and the imitation crab tasted sour. We told the waitress & the manager then came to our table nibbling a piece and telling me I was wrong, the crab was fine. I told her that what I had was bad & she disagreed. I then proceeded to make three trips to the restroom to vomit. Never again will I step foot in here! The quality was once good, but now it is terrible. Save your money and find somewhere else to go!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not the place to go for a dinner buffet the crab legs were so overcooked that they were mushy and bland. The service was terrible my waiter was a gentleman that all he did was follow the female waitress around as she refill napkins and supplies for the tables and chat at her instead of doing his job and waiting on me and filling my drink or removing my plates."}
{"text":"They are rude and dirty! Walked in...ordered our drinks...went and got a plate.... Came back to the table and started to eat...noticed there was a hair in our food...let the server know and he just walked away! We decided not to eat there... Got up went to register and asked for manager...he said I am the manager.. And charged us $30 for nothing!!! We were told NOT to go there in the first place by other friends...should have listened!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and do not think I can eat there again and maybe a lot of you wont either after this review. The food on the buffet looked old and tired with the exception of a few things. It was about 1:15 so the food should not look that way. The cold buffet had a large selection of fruit and my son asked for grapes. The grapes appeared to be fresh, until my wife who was helping my other son ran over and literally grabbed the grape out of his mouth. She walked me over to the bowl and showed me what appeared to be mold on many grapes. Thankfully the grapes on my sons plate looked \"mold free\" I then witnessed a server drop a towel on the floor. I said to my wife I hope he picks it up and gets rid of it. He picked it up and proceeded to wipe down a table with it... DISCUSTING! He didn't use any sanitizer on the table and the \"floor towel\" appeared to be bone dry with no sanitizer on it. I also witnessed another server clear a table with her hands fully submerged in the cup and then proceeded to roll silverware with her germ infested hand.. Lost my appetite and didn't want kids eating anything else. I witnessed the same health code neglect in Mandarin Seafood Buffet in Twinsburg. Sorry no more Chinese buffets for me ever"}
{"text":"I didn't think it was actually all that fun. NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE. But the food all seemed like it had been sitting there for hours.. maybe days? Probably. The service wasn't good either. None of the food was like horrible.. but some of it did look horrible. I would definitely not recommend this place. If you like cheap Chinese (and random other food) that is old and sitting under a light... than I guess you may like this place. But the buffet is not impressive and I would suggest that you go somewhere else to have FUN"}
{"text":"This isn't the best I've had, but it's the best in the area.  A large fruit and salad bar in the middle, fresh stir-fry in the back, and 3 hot bars and a dessert bar that includes 6 ice-creams to choose from.  They have fresh sushi, but I don't recommend getting sushi from and all-you-can-eat kinda place.  I've always had excellent service here.  Fast and friendly with seating and getting drinks.  The waitresses get along really well with my boys, which is a plus, and their bathrooms are in working order. Only do lunch here because dinner prices are out of this world!!   A little hard to get into the place but worth the effort."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area visiting my family over the holidays and my sister wanted a quick place we could go for dinner after attending Christmas Eve church service. Fearing most nearby full-service restaurants would be booked or closed she thought the Fun Buffet would fill the bill for the eight of us.  We got to the restaurant at about 6:45pm and discovered it was fairly full.  We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken.  We had no issues with the service, our server was prompt and attentive.  I visited the men's room before eating to wash my hands and found it to be dirty with an overflowing trash can, paper trash on the floor, toilets and urinals that were very stained and a paper towel dispenser that really made you work to get any product out of it.  The whole room smelled like urine.    On to the food where we found no fun at the Fun Buffet. The selection was not very large and there was no salad bar to speak of, just some lettuce and very few other items to add to it. There was an hibachi grill where you could put items on a plate and have the chef prepare them for you but the items to choose from were pretty limited compared to what I've experienced at other Asian buffets and didn't look very appealing.  I started with some sushi which was not very appetizing so I quickly abandoned it and headed back to the buffet.  I bit into an egg roll and grease just dripped out of it onto my plate, it was the same story with the battered chicken pieces (for sweet and sour) and the chicken wings were so dry and tasteless I don't know how anyone could eat them .  The fried fish was so hard it couldn't be cut with a fork and was difficult to cut with a butter knife, it was absolutely inedible.  Most of the items I tried were dried out from sitting on the steam table too long and didn't get replaced while we were there.  Overall the food was pretty bland and boring and not fresh at all.    On to the deserts.  There was the typical selection of mediocre Asian buffet items but the big tubs of ice cream looked promising.  Unfortunately the two flavors I tried (strawberry and cookies & cream) were not very good.  They tasted freezer burnt and had traces of that crystallization you get when ice cream has thawed and refrozen.  Needless to say, we will never return to this restaurant on our future visits to the area."}
{"text":"Food was average at best and service wasn't great."}
{"text":"The sushi here always seems to be decent. The rest of the food is mediocre at best. It is either overcooked or is held in warming trays much too long. The staff is rude and abusive they often sit down at the table and eat with you right next to you and talk very loudly in Chinese. This makes the dining room seemed more like an employee break room. I guess its good if you're stuck in a hotel somewhere in Streetsboro but if you can avoid it I would.  In the past I paid about $8 before dinner time but today I ate there at 230PM and all of a sudden the prices jumped to $12 per person for the buffet. This is way overpriced for the service that you get and the quality of the food is served.  Crab legs are serve on the buffet but they are served cold I assume this is to discourage you from eating too much. Not worth it I would suggest mandarin seafood buffet in Twinsburg but they are currently remodeling and the dining room is closed."}
{"text":"Best chinese food I ever had  I love this place it can't be better I have to go there a lot more"}
