{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Very low cost for such quality and quantity. I don't often get full for so little money, but I was completely stuffed after I finished my meal. The Philly cheese steak was delicious; every bite satisfied my taste buds. This is one of those places where you are gonna wanna try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I haven't had a philly steak like this is years. Just gave it my first try today. The food was fresh, hot and fast. Truly an amazing taste. Worth giving it a shot if you have never been!

Also the staff and management were very pleasant. 

10/10 they have a new customer."}
{"text":"Place is delicious and has a awesome Philly cheese steak sandwich. I ordered the 10 inch Cheese \"The Works\" and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"It was my first time here & I've gotta say i was very impressed with the food. I got a BBQ Philly & honey hot wings. The Philly was juicy and full of flavor. The wings were good but i would have loved them even more if they were actually spicy. They're more like honey wings. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fiance & I were looking for a delicious sandwich spot, so hit up Yelp for recommendations & ended up here. I got a Philly with steak, white american, lettuce & tomato. It was super yum! The meat was well done like I like it, thin, not super fatty, and seasoned well. The bread was unbelievably soft! Like crazy soft. The veggies were fresh, no brown lettuce or unripe tomatoes.

My fiance also had a Philly sandwich...I forget what it was called. It had steak, white american cheese, green peppers, banana peppers (although I could've sworn it was jalapenos), mushrooms, and maybe something else.

Inside isn't anything special. A few basic tables with chairs, a tv, and a sweet mirrored wall to watch yourself, or others if you're into that sort of thing, eat. The gal behind the counter was super nice & accomodating. There was a table of business dudes, and one other lonely fella there when we werethere around 1:00/1:30ish, so we definitely missed the lunch rush. By the time we sat down after getting our drinks and napkins, our food was ready and delivered to us at our table! Gotta love speedy food delivery when you're starving. 

All in all the Philly's were super dericious, not super greasy. We split the frys that came with his combo. The large sandwiches and half an order of frys was enough food for my fiance and I, and we both left with full tummies. It was about $15 for both of us, which isn't bad considering feeding 2 at a fast food restaurant is nearly that much. Can't wait to go back. Now that I think about it, maybe I'll hit em up for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just recently moved nearby and am glad to have found a local spot with really good food. Their gyro is wonderful and I'm usually picky on my gyro, I like their salads and everything else I've tried so far. Service is good and the people working there are very nice. Not too expensive either and they have lots of good deals. I've been very happy and I like supporting local mom and pop shops, which this one is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I love that they offer fried mushrooms! I've always loved them and having a pregnant wife at home who constantly craves them makes my day so much better! The cheesesteaks are delicious and reasonably priced, not to mention extremely filling. The only down side is they aren't open on Sundays for the month of July. My wife and I both love this place, the staff is very friendly and helpful, food is delicious and pretty quick,  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Real good. I just had a 10\" Philly with everything and if I thought I wouldn't blow up I'd stuff in another."}
{"text":"I had the philly cheese steak and it was FAN-F*CKING-TASTIC! I ordered a side of ziki sauce to dip my fries. This places is small and hidden but makes a filling lunch that's for sure. Don't judge this book by its cover."}
{"text":"Spicy Chick was hard, Gryo was also hard and crunchy. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today. I got the Philly Max with fries and a drink. The sandwich was delicious - just the right balance of meat, cheese, onions, peppers, and bread. The prices were very reasonable, and I got a good amount of food. The man at the counter was very friendly. I will be going back there again."}
{"text":"This lil hidden treasure (emphasis on hidden) is totally DELISH!!!  We had cheese steaks with provolone and mushrooms; I was secretly very pleased to see that they even offered cheese whiz (for those looking for the TRUE Philly style cheese steak); the rolls were fresh and tasty and the meat was seasoned almost perfectly; I am from the East Coast and quite close to Philly, so, was accustomed to a bit more grease and pepper, but, otherwise......AMAZING!!!  Oh yea, the fries were also really hot and crisp!!!  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food with reasonable prices! 10 inch HOT and DELICIOUS Philly steak with cheese, peppers, onions and mayo for $7.49!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a little place hidden in the plaza behind McDonald's. But it's defiantly a hidden gem! The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The philly subs and wings are amazingly!! I won't eat a Philly sub from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, I was looking for \"hole in the wall\" restaurants out here in Arizona.  Scottsdale doesn't have too many mom and pop shops so I had to drive around the areas that are more profound of mom&pop shops.

I drove down Southern and was about to hit up McDonalds until I saw this place right behind it.  Gyros is one of my favorite hot meals but what attracted me was the Philly Cheese Steaks they were advertising.  

I went in and it felt like the restaurants I would walk in my home state.  The food smelled delicious and the prices were the average price.  They have a really good selection of food even though their advertising scheme is Cheese Steaks, Gyros, and Wings.  Customer service is a plus and they had our food out in average time.

I ended up ordering a Gyro combo and my nephew ordered a Burger combo.

I'm not a picky eater, so when I dug in, I ate it and thought of the gyro being a good gyro.  My nephew however doesn't really approve of hole in the wall restaurants, but after taking a bite of the burger and his fries, he actually likes the spot.  Me and him will definitely go back in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to fill my tummy with a good delicious philly steak sandwich! I keep going back for more. Food is made to order. Never had any problems with them. Very nice and friendly people. I highly recommend this place 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Woo hoo!! The best hole in the wall in Mesa!! The honey hot wings were well worth the 9.85 i paid for the, also bought the chicken gyro for the ol wifey, success!! A happy wife is a happy life!! I would recommend this place to anyone who has a chicken wing craving like i do!! Awesome job guys!!! Definatly a hidden diamond!!!"}
{"text":"They have a big ad for $6 philly but when you go inside they tell you that it's only Sunday or Monday.  That's small letters ..... I don't like place that have fine print like that.

Also, there was a fly all over me while eating.  That's not a 100% in their control but I sure hope that it's not normal practice.

If you want a cheap meal, go for it, otherwise find a place that treats you with more respect and not talk down to you."}
{"text":"I've driven by this location many times but have never stopped in because I thought it was just a \"Hole in the wall.\" After having lunch there today, I would definitely recommend it and I personally will definitely be back. Excellent Philly sandwiches and really great service!"}
{"text":"The wings were ok. They serve them with carrots, and celery. I also had a free yelp coupon for fries (awesome!). Overall decent,  I may be back."}
{"text":"The five dollar 10\" cheesesteaks on Sundays are Mondays are so flipping good. In addition, we always get onion rings, and it comes which ranch on the side. I am not a huge meat eater but I devour this sandwhich every time. It takes about 5-10 minutes to cook so don't get your panties in a bunch waiting. It's worth it.

I wish they carried Diet Dr. Pepper. Small issue, sorry!"}
{"text":"Friend had a craving for a Philly Cheesesteak, so away we went on the hunt. Ran across Philly Steak & Wings and thought we'd give it a try. I used to know the family who ran this place. They had a great lil place on Broadway between Stapley & Mesa Dr. called \"Max's Cozy Kitchen\".  BEST sandwiches ever; and really nice people. They decided to move over my MCC, and it went bad from there.  I really don't think it was the food, but the location stinks. This area of Mesa is a pit these days, surrounded by vacant strip malls and skleezy people.  Appears the family has sold.  The new management is seemingly keeping the philly steak sandwiches same and they were very good.  I wanted to try the wings, because if you're one of my followers, you'll know I'm in search of the best wings and pizza in Arizona.  The wings here were gross. I'm pretty sure they were pre-cooked and just reheated in the microwaved in some hot sauce.  They were dry and tough. The sauce was pretty good (Frank's Hot Sauce), but it didn't cover the strange taste of the wings.  The combo came with fries which were decent; crispy. The ketchup squirt bottle had a nasty crust-ring of ketchup visible just under the cap which REALLY turned me off, as it's a pretty good indicator of their lack of cleanliness. Too bad too, cuz I really liked the sandwich.  Think I'll keep hunting."}
{"text":"There's a lot of food for the price. Great deal. Kind of tucked in the corner. Food is very good, customer service not so much but I will keep coming back for the food."}
{"text":"This place was \"ok\" I ordered the number 1 the half Philly cheesteak sandwich with fries and a drink. The total was almost $9. The fries were great. They gave a lot and were good and crunchy. The sandwich on the other hand was completely bland with little flavor. It was mostly bread a huge thick bread to make it look like a big sandwich. I added mushrooms for an extra charge and it was like they didnt even cook them, almost as if they microwaved them and slabbed them on. The fries were good but definitely not enough to make me come back again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, had the philly max, combo was around 8 dollars. Pepperchinis top it off perfectly. Defiantly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a welcoming atmosphere! Great owners and environment. Highly recommended to come here. It is a neighborhood must go to."}
{"text":"Had the philly steak with cheese. Wasn't the cheese whiz. Some white cheese. Anyhow, sandwich was OK. The fries were overcooked. Wasn't the best but wasn't the worst. I don't think I will try again..."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and the best Philly Cheesesteaks in town (order with cheese whiz). I'm lucky to live so close."}
{"text":"Found this place when I got lost in Mesa, I went in starving and the pleasant service was almost as big a relief as the amazing sandwiches. I ate one while the nice folks working there gave me directions, I was so grateful I bough sandwiches for the rest of the family and a few for experimentation later. Two of the sandwiches didn't survive the trip home because they're just THAT good. Don't hesitate to drop by if you're in the area because it's worth the trip and worth going out of your way to enjoy."}
{"text":"I had half of a philly and all I can say is I wish I had gotten a whole! The half just teased my appetite making me want more, so it was definitely a good sandwich

If you're not looking, you'll definitely miss it. They do charge extra for toppings such as cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc...

Overall it's a good place to try out if you're in the mood for a philly and the owner was nice."}
{"text":"What a great mix!  The menu may seem overwhelming, but it's not. You can get a cheese steak, gyros, pastrami sandwiches, wings, and boba drink. It's a 1 stop shop.

Had a Philly cheese steak with cheez wiz, honey bbq wings, and really good french fries with a taro boba drink.  The cheez steak was cooked so well had the right amount of Philly grease. I had them put double cheese so provolone and cheez wiz with onions and mushroom, but you can put whatever you want on it. The service was fast too. I went during lunch and got my food faster that it took to order it! 

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars which they deserve, but they need to market more. They are in a strip mall that looks deserted. Almost as though no one knows its there unless they make an accidental turn."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for lunch. My Favorite is the dozen wing combo. I would probably stop by here before every Sunday football if I could."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently for lunch- I haven't had anything  bad here. I crave the Philly cheese steak with everything- it's amazing. I have recently discovered  the gyro platter which is delicious and on the healthy side- that is until I add the mozzarella sticks
or fried zucchini- yum!!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak ever. 
It was juicy, warm, and overall flavorful! 

5 inches for $5.39. Philly Mac, I'll be back!!!! Did I mention it is the BEST? 

Sunday and Monday Special: 10 inches for $6.00!!"}
{"text":"Cool local place to get some tasty Philly Steak Sandwiches and then some when shopping around the Fiesta Mall area in Mesa. Nice clean and tidy restaurant with super friendly service and a yummy menu to satisfy your hunger. You may even see the local law enforcement eating lunch while you dine which I always enjoy.

They offer several versions of the Philly Steak Sandwiches as well as Hot and Cold Subs, Gyros, Chicken Wings, Salads, Burgers and more. Hot Dog!

I like my Philly Steak with Cheez Whiz or White American depending on my taste for the day. The Philly MAX comes with onions, mushrooms, pepperoncinis, sweet peppers and a cheese of your choice and is what I like to order. It's hard not to resist some crispy fries covered with Cheez Whiz and maybe some bacon added for an extra buck. They also have several other options for sides such as onion rings, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks, curly fries, popcorn chicken, mozzarella sticks etc.

Located right behind that Carl's burger dude off Southern in a somewhat dilapidated strip mall due to the economy. No worries. Definitely worth a visit. See ya there next time. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Random stop in this pretty empty stripmall led me to try the cheesesteaks here. It is a decent deal at 9 bucks for  a 10 inch combo with fries and a drink. The fries are standard bag variety, but served very hot and salty. I usually ask what kind of meat they use, but forgot and this wasn't ribeye. The food was servicable, but nothing memorable and I only finished half of the thing. There were alot of onions and sweet peppers and white american cheese was used, but meat quality took it down a few stars. It's ribeye or bust usually for a top notch cheesesteak. Get the 5 inch sandwich if you find yourself here and I don't know how you possibly would end up here. I had a friend staying closeby which is my excuse."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for just about a year, but went there for dinner for the first time tonight. Had the Philly cheesesteak with cheese fries... I am not regretting it.

I am not sure what they put in the cheese fries; it can't be crack because that would be illegal. But I am fiending for them nonetheless & I just had a full basket. 

Honest as well... we were accidentally over charged & didn't notice. The difference of $2 was returned in cash along with an apology. This bumped what would have been a solid 4 star review to a 5.

Amazing food & integrity? I'm a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Literally Arby's meat on a bun. I'm from Philly and this was inedible. Fries were overly done and not fresh tasting. Save yourself the trouble and go to Capriottis. My mouth is coated with enough grease to cook ANOTHER batch of fries. Ugh."}
{"text":"Great place.  Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!"}
{"text":"This food has the best flavor. The food tastes authentic unlike all the cheap fast food you see around. They are also prompt and friendly. You see someone cleaning constantly. I would recommend this restraunt to everyone! Try the honey bbq wings and the motzerella sticks."}
{"text":"Gyro here beats Pita Jungle, which doesn't say too much but if you're a gyro fan, you will enjoy the gyros here.

French fries are fried perfectly. Crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.

Chicken wings were a bit dry but I loved the sauce it came in. I ordered 'hot'.

Philly Cheesesteak bread melts in your mouth. I'm not a philly cheesesteak aficionado per say but this one is worth a shot.

$5.99 on Sundays and Mondays will get you a Philly Cheesesteak, side of fries, 4 wings and a drink."}
{"text":"Looking for a place nearby I haven't tried yet for wings and I found this little hole in the wall. 

Wings were much better than I expected and the hot sauce had some good kick. The Philly wasn't the best but wasn't the worst, pretty average. Maybe it was the seasoning that was missing. The fries however were clearly the worst part of the combo. Soggy, un-salted, barely fried. I could tell these were frozen fries from the freezer aisle. 

I would go back for the wings nothing else."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. Awesome from taking my order to getting it done fast to great place to just hang out and talk. Great job I am coming back and telling all my friends to. And a great out door seating area. Bill Kuhagen 1-31-17 
Came back again and it was awesome food hot and Delicious. And the head chef made sure I was welcome. I think this wood be a great place to have a birthday party or family gathering. Bill Kuhagen 2-3-17"}
{"text":"If you are ever craving a Philly cheesesteak sandwich try taste of Philly the sandwiches and wings are good."}
{"text":"Has anyone that has given this place a positive review ever had a REAL cheesesteak or gyro? Husband and I tried the gyros and they were dry and flavorless. Pretty sure the gyro meat came from a bag and was heated up in a microwave.  For what we paid, we would have gotten twice the amount of food elsewhere. Pathetic.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Impressive cheesesteaks. We don't live in the area but were visiting this part of town and decided to stop here for dinner because of the good reviews. We were not disappointed. The wings were spicy and good. The cheesesteaks were delicious. I had mushrooms and onions on mine while my husband had everything on his. Super good. We will definitely be coming back here the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I spent all this time talking about a wiz wit and I was served a Philly Cheesesteak with white american.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Came back a second time to try the philly cheese steak......i was not impressed. The meat was flavorless but juicy, no lettuce, tomatoes...etc whats with that."}
{"text":"Philly steaks, hot wings, salty fries, and an amazing Italian sandwich... Come here and come hungry.  Excellent food with a great staff to help you decide.  Try it all,well worth it!"}
{"text":"Kind of a pain to get to with the construction.  The guy taking the order seemed very inefficient and confused.  The Pilly Max cheesesteak was AMAZING.  I loved the bread and the gooey cheesey mushroomy steak on it.  I would order it next time with just cheese, mushroom and meat though as the other flavors got old as I was eating the huge thing.  Fresh brewed iced tea was a huge plus.  My kids shared a huge turkey and avocado sandwich.  They thought it was just okay, same with the fries.  We took it to go and it wasn't super fast but not to slow either."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were exploring the almost abandoned Fiesta Mall and found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We each got the cheese steak with cheese whiz and fries. Really good sandwiches and fries. The owners were very friendly and checked how the food was. Would definitely return and recommend to my friends. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The Philly Cheesesteak is top quality at the cheapest price around!"}
{"text":"They got bomb gyros. Only thing is its almost $8 & doesn't come with feta cheese ($1.60 add on)."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner order two chicken phillys with cheese wiz. We got home and only had one chicken as they other steak (we don't eat dark meat) and thEre was zero cheese wiz. I'm a little disappointed because the rating and my past experience was good but this time was wayyyy off."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! The cheesesteaks here are awesome! My husband had the mushroom and white cheddar cheesesteak and I had the provolone and grilled onion with sweet pepper cheesesteak. Tender, tasty and hot. The roll was very fresh.
We also had the bbq chicken wings. They were meaty, but just average in flavor. 
They no longer have the Tastycakes. They said the distributor has been having problems and they can't get them anymore.
The place was spotless and the grill was very clean. Parking is right at the door. The store is behind the McDonalds and Carl's Jr and a little hard to find. We will be returning for the cheesesteaks. Highly recommend this mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place , I tried the gyro & the garden salad with chicken . They were good but I wish there was more lettuce then chicken . I could of made 2 salads with the amount of chicken they put on ... But I definitely will be back ."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the food is delicious!!! The service is always fast and the food is hot ! You gotta give this place a try"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here when I was in Arizona last month.  The food was just a big greasy gritty mixture of lard and cheap meat. The breads were dry and flavorless and when I left my clothes smelled like I was in the back cooking their slop all day.  The staff is very rude and the language barrier makes it hard to order or even complain.  The owner was there and when I tried to talk to him about my bad service and mediocre food he blew me off and said he does not need my business.  I think his name was Tek but Im not sure.  

The food here is for people who do not care about quality and flavor.  It is cheap meats, in cheap bread, with overcooked sides.  The lard leaks all over the place, including down your chin, and the staff is unbearably hostile and rude. I felt very uncomfortable here and the food was so bad that I wished I had never came here in the 1st place.  

I do not recommend eating here and my advise to the owner is stop treating your patrons like we do not matter."}
{"text":"Their Philly Steak sandwich, meat and cheese in every bite, honestly very tasty! As a disclaimer I have never been to Philly so I cannot tell you how authentic this sandwich is, but honestly I do not care because it is that good. 

The restaurant appeared very clean and picture my surprise when I asked for ketchup and they reached in the refrigerator and handed me a chilled bottle. Wow! I thought I was the only one with OCD to the extreme that the thought of using a ketchup bottle that has been sitting out, for who know how long, is so disgusting and that is the norm at most places, but not here.   

This place is well hidden behind a Mcdonalds, so make sure you get the address and set your GPS for the next time you find yourself hungry and in Mesa."}
{"text":"I got the recommendation for this place from an Uber Eats driver. This is why I tip my Uber Eats drivers...

The staff made a small goof on the bill, which I would never have noticed. While waiting for the meal, the gal comes over, explains she overcharged me and hands me the difference ($2).

That alone would be enough to bring me back. The food though... The cheese fries might come with an addiction warning, but I'm sure there's a 12-step for people who find themselves going down that rabbit hole. The Philly was better than expected. Full of flavor and on an exceptional roll. 

Eat it. It's good."}
{"text":"We love this place...  when your child only eats certain foods, adding new things can be difficult.   Sooo, anytime we find a new place where our son will actually devour the food without asking what's in it, we come here often."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years!!! I  moved out of the neighborhood and haven't been able to come here in years finally stopped in today love love this place amazing best philly cheese steak in Arizona"}
{"text":"10 inch sandwiches extra meat loaded, cost me 20 bucks, not worth it."}
{"text":"So when I first drove up to this empty stripmall I thought oh this isn't good.. But went in and had one of the best meals.. I had their special 5 inch Philly sandwich with mushrooms and onions & cheese, it came with 4 wings and fresh cooked fries and a med drink... The staff was very nice  and we will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Have only actually been in the restaurant once because we usually get delivery. My wife always gets the philly and I always get the gyro. The food is usually here faster than we could drive there and it's always hot and fresh. This is slowly becoming a once a week place for me. Awesome service, delicious food, and fast. I'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This small surprise of a find really made me happy. Originally I had gone to the shopping complex for Euro Cafe...it is closed and it looks like there is a frame store in its place.

It is located on the northeast corner of Longmore and Southern directly behind McDonald's and right next to Life Uniform.

BTW -- What is it with strip malls with strip malls behind the strip mall? Also, what's up with the inability to properly NUMBER a freaking building? The numbers here are hidden so well, you practically have to run into the building with your car...even though it won't actually guarantee that you will find the number.  URGH

Anyway, I digress...sorry! For a scant $10 I was surprised to get a 12 inch philly cheesesteak with fries and a drink.

The meat was lovely and not mega greasy like some other Philly Cheesesteak places. The cheese also wasn't added on top as an afterthought, either. They had taken the time to actually blend it with the meat, onions and mushrooms -- heavenly! The result is something that doesn't stretch for miles on end after you take a bite, only to sloppily land on your shirt or even worse, drop food onto your lap or plate. The fries were not dipped in salt like Two Hippies. They serve Coke products -- boo, hiss!

The owner (or I am assuming he is the owner) and I were talking about Euro Cafe...He said it's been closed for over a year. He said I should try the Gyro next time...and I will.

Decor is scant, but functional...and it is wonderfully clean. You won't feel like you've stumbled into the kind of place that will make you feel sick after the first bite - I loved it here.

I really hope this place does well. I have my reservations because of where it is located - behind two fast food restaurants and a strip mall that's about 20% empty. I wouldn't have found this place if I hadn't pulled over to google Euro Cafe on my phone."}
{"text":"The good here is so good! The Philly Max and BBQ Wings are pretty awesome. The staff here have always been friendly and keep the place very clean. If you want a good cheesesteak or wings, I recomend Philly Steak & Wings :)"}
{"text":"My family loves this place, too bad it's so far away from us in Gilbert. We always get their large philly cheese steak subs to go and they're still hot even after a 15 minute trip home. Only downside, their subs are extremely greasy, so you'll need a couple napkins indulging in this fatty sub!"}
{"text":"Awesome philly cheese steaks sandwiches great bread, doesn't get soggy, great meat, great toppings. French fries are perfect- shoe string fries(crispy). So yummy. 5inch is more like 6-7 inch so it's perfect but so good I could eat the large! Love small hole in the wall places with great food and this is one of them."}
{"text":"The only place I'll go to get a Philly Cheese Steak!! I don't add any sauce because it's already sooo good and flavorful! I just get steak, cheese, and onions!! Mmmm!! Went yesterday for lunch and then back again today for lunch!! GO if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"The cheese steak was tasty but the service was awful. I will not return here. I left feeling unappreciated and disappointed. It's a shame they were so inattentive and unfriendly. Even though the food was good I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They actually cook the vegetables with the steak and don't just throw them on the sandwich in the end. I love banana peppers -- So cooking the peppers in with the steak gave the meat that tangy banana pepper flavor that I love! Juicy, warm, full of flavor. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in the East Valley hidden in this barren strip mall! Check them out next time you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Love the Philly cheesesteaks and the chicken gyros. Best zucchini sticks ever. They're always hot and amazing. My boyfriend and I get this for dinner often. It's pretty cheap and a little hidden gem. It's too bad that there's street construction everywhere. But I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great deal, 6 dollars for a 12 inch steak with an additional topping which was packed with meat on a Sunday and it was a good steak. The guys makes making the magic happen are friendly, let us know about deals to save money and the food came out so fast. Great place , nice and quiet . huge ranch Tahitian container just in case you are thinking of buying an additional one, trust me you might not need it , and I use a alot of ranch . wings are great, cheesy sticks great and the fries are great. I might being sounding like classic Tony the Tiger, this place really is great. Much recommended and thank you for a good meal."}
{"text":"Gosh am I picky!  Shawn, my main cheesesteak taste tester and consultant representing the 16 year olds of America, would perhaps give this one a four star.  I took off points for size of the roll to the quantity of meat, and the absence of provolone when I ordered.   I also take marks off for being closed on a Sunday...Sometimes you need a cheesesteak after worship.  Just saying.
Despite the hours and the cheese preferences, this place is in my opinion not as good as Cordeleone's in Tempe, but is certainly worth stopping at to get a taste of the ole neighborhood east.  The average cheesesteak lover will find this perfectly acceptable and will not blink once while smelling all the grizzle on the grill.

They even have Tastykakes...a personal favourite of mine and I think that I heard rumour of soft pretzels being murmured as becoming available soon.  I also liked seeing all the old Philly paraphenalia all over the place."}
{"text":"Looks like they have some pretty awesome deals. But if you want a great philly, just go to forefathers. Wasn't impressed in the slightest."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times.  Time before last I ordered the Italian sub sandwich.  It was huge and oh so good.  Much better than subway.  This last time my daughter  and I went, I ordered the Philly with everything on it.  My daughter got Med. wings.  

This place gives you a lot for your money.   I've had better Philly's at other places but the wings, are my new fav here.  Nice and crispy and the sauce wasn't just pored all over them, it was just the right amt. of sauce. 
  The medium hot sauce had a little more kick in it than the other med. sauces we've had at other places.  If your looking for a place for good wings, this is it.  

The restaurant itself is clean, but to me, it doesn't give the vibe of wanting to hang out for long time to chit chat with friends.  It's one of those real quick bites.

Over all, I would recommend trying this place at least once.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Honestly it was okay... Not anything... Im dreaming of having again... The wings suck A**.... The philly Steaks are mediocre.... The fries I had... Were disgusting... You could tell that the oil they fried them in was old and needed to be changed.... Hopefully, they have changed the oil in the fryer...."}
{"text":"Favorite Monday evening dinner! Half priced on Monday's and they have a Philly sandwich that rocks. They make everything fresh and I have yet to get anything inconsistent. This place is spot on and staff are friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I had REALLY hoped I had scored a \"in my backyard\" good sandwich shop.
The pastrami sandwich (lunch special) did taste good... but really skimpy on the meat portion. The fries were a joke.. preprocessed out of a bag and poor quality.. really??
Add on to that, staff that could care less if we ate there or not...
How this place gets anything over 1 star is beyond me."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back good was great and service. Food was fresh Philly cheesesteak, fries, and wings were all great"}
{"text":"It was ok, they have a good daily special and good sunday special. Honestly I don't know what a \"real\" Philly Cheesesteak tastes like, so it's hard for me to judge. I would have given it a 4stars, but after eating it, I seemed to burp it up nastily. Still tasted really good, but like I said, it made me do lots of gross burps for the next hr or so lol"}
{"text":"Sold 4 star experience,  or wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either.  Sometimes you just want to eat greasy bad food and this was the fix.  I wouldn't completely so going,  but just long enough till I want greasy food again.  Cheese steak isn't supposed to be healthy,  that's why I like it.  The staff was nice and service was quick.  But a little over priced."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

This place, surprisingly is not half bad!  Its a cute little place at the very end of a very sad empty strip mall, but it holds it own with delicious food!

I cruised in here last night to try something different.  They have a variety of menu items, from Gyros, to burgers, along with some wings and Philly steak sandwiches.   Heaven to me!

I went with a Gyro, and it was surprisingly tasty!  Plenty of seating here, with TV's and a menu to make most happy.   Great hours too!  Aside from being in a sad empty strip mall, go check this place out!"}
{"text":"I cant answer about the Cheese Steaks because I've only had one here once. It was really good but I can't compare it to anywhere else cuzz I don't usually eat them. But this place has awesome wings and zucchini! The price is a little higher than other places even their combos. But you'll leave satisfied even tho your wallet will be lighter lol"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner yesterday, tried their signature Philly cheesesteak sub W/fries and got a gyro sandwich to go.  Everything was delicious and the service was awesome! Great small family owned joint...must visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! Any chance I get to stop in I do. A little bit dated and simple inside but the food makes up for it. Service is always friendly, food comes out hot and quick. The Phillies are flavorful and have good structure for stuffing your face with. Haha best Phillies in the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped here while in Mesa for work based on the yelp reviews. Needed something quick before our class. When I pulled up I was a little worried. No cars and didn't look like much, but the reviews were great so I had to try it. I had the special,  a 5 inch philly cheese steak and hot wings. I liked it all. I ordered mine with cheese whiz,  but it had provolone when I got it. Didn't have time to change it. It was still good. I will have to try it with cheese whiz next time. Prices are good and the portions are just right."}
{"text":"Their gyro is just ok.  Adding feta cheese is pricey.  Taste is ok. Overall,  the gyro at American Discount Foods (in the same parking lot) is better quality, tastier, and cheaper. ($5.50 combo wih feta, fries, and drink at ADC)  Oh and the language barrier can be a bit troublesome."}
{"text":"This is my sister's restaurant, so I am a little biased but the food is great and the owners are great!!! :) I recommend the wings, Gyro, turkey BLT, or cheese steak.  I also love the zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"Close to work so have given 2 tries.  No Thanks.  First time wings.  Gross. Soggy and disgusting.  So couple months later decided to give it another try.  Philly cheese steak was also  disgusting.  Meat was dry & stringy.  Bun was soggy.  Restaurant smells terrible so opted for takeout.  Both meals ended up in the garbage.  Such a disappointment since I love to go to bat for the small businesses."}
{"text":"First time customer. Great portion size for what you pay for and the food is delicious! I got a philly cheese steak and my boyfriend got wings which both turned out to be awesome. However there was a longer wait for our take out order than anticipated but seems like we hit during the lunch rush. So worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant place.  Food is very good, generous portions, and the staff is quick and courteous.  Highly reccomended.  Quiet atmosphere and very clean.  Chicken wings are very tasteful and the Philly Cheese is super."}
{"text":"Still have never been let down with the quality and taste of all the food here. The hot wings are always made perfectly, and are noticeably bigger than most restaurants. The cheese steaks are wonderfully delicious every time, and I was even totally surprised how good the salad was. The staff are always very friendly, and phone-in orders always seem ready by the time I can get there. Great local spot that deserves lots of success."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We love to come here when we are craving cheese steaks! We used to go to Forefathers weekly but price hikes and increasingly poor quality had us looking for new places. Definitely glad we found this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what are the reviews are saying because the Philly cheesesteak was not that good and the prices went up"}
{"text":"First time here and I will have to say, they are waaayyy better than alot of philly steaks I have encountered here in AZ. I will return, today I chose the dozen wings 6 honey hot and 6 honey bbq. Today was my first time checking in so I was surprised with a free small fry! Bit back to the wings.. they were good I like a lil crunch with my wings and they didnt let me down*smiles* I will return and try more items on their menu!!!"}
{"text":"These guys need help. A gem in an empty business park.  Great $10 Sunday Deal. 5 inch philly, fries,  4 wings and drink combo $9.99.

 I had them twice so far, great all around."}
{"text":"I crave these sandwiches and the French fries are perfectly crispy. Fast and friendly service. We visit every few weeks to get our fix!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, this will become a my new bi weekly eating joint.
And they deliver.

Had the Philly Max and am in love."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks out here in general are really different from the only ones I've ever had so it was a little weird my first time but at the same time got me hooked. They use the cheese that I like (I'm not into the wiz on my steak), have extremely reasonable prices compared to the same food anywhere else, really nice staff (even the cooks in the back), and it's just good food. Definitely recommend it. Even though I just moved out here a month ago I've come here several times, admittedly I get the same thing every time but I'm sure the rest is good too and I'll try it out soon enough."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. Have never had a bad experience. The owner & wife are always working and are so friendly. Their chicken philly is to die for."}
{"text":"It's so easy to miss this place as it is tucked in behind a McDonald's, but that's what we call \"a hidden gem\" in the biz... \"the biz\" being the business of finding rad little tucked away restaurants that serve good food. 

I've eaten here twice over the last few years, and it didn't really register with me that it was the bomb for some reason... it was good, but I guess it was because it wasn't my neighborhood place back then. We recently moved closer to it though, so last night my girl brought me home a full cheesesteak. It was indeed \"the bomb,\" and I realized that I should have put it on my list of great cheesesteak places a lot sooner (I don't have such a list yet, but if I did this would be on it for sure).

The meat was tender, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Most cheesesteak places use roughly the same meat and cheese (in varying quantities), but beyond that, the differences will come down to how well they cook and season the meat, and what kind of bun they use. Here, they use a good ratio of meat to cheese to bread. Not too much cheese so that it's all over your hands and everything else - just enough for flavor. I might have to try it with a tiny bit more meat next time, but really it was plenty. Every bite was perfect end to end. The bread they use was soft and chewy. Some places give you dryer or harder bread - I prefer the softer stuff because it goes along better with the savoriness of the meat.

The few times I've been in there, it has been clean. The owners and staff are always really nice. I've tried talking them into doing delivery, but I don't think they're set up for that. Having eaten from here a handful of times now, I'm realizing that it's also been consistently good. 

It's pretty safe to bring your friend from out of town who claims he can't get a decent philly and act like you've got the angle on the best kept secret in Phoenix. The truth is, there's nothing magical about the cheesesteak in general. It's not tough to make, and as I said the ingredients are roughly the same everywhere you go (like, the meat is probably literally the same product from the same distributor). It's easy to mess it up, but it's also not terribly complicated to do it right. 

These places that brag about being the most authentic or legit or whatever are just blowing smoke. Also the idea that you can only get a good or authentic cheesesteak in Philly is absurd. I've had a few (one from the most famous place actually in Philly), and they're all about the same. I guess some places just achieve the highest level of greatness one can achieve with these simple ingredients, and then it just becomes a pissing match over who is more authentic or who is more from Philly or some other thing that doesn't matter. 

This place serves among the best cheesesteaks in the Valley, and rivals the best I've had in Philly or anywhere else. I live closer now.... I'm going to get fat."}
