{"text":"Met a friend for a late breakfast today at Tommy's. I've been there before a few times, so I knew what to expect. Service was friendly and attentive. The place was clean, too.   I ordered pancakes, sausage links and 2 eggs, over easy. It was just right. Those pancakes were very light and fluffy. The sausage was not too greasy and the eggs were cooked just as I ordered them. My friend had the Tommy's scramble. I had it once before and it was really good. She enjoyed it again too.   Tommy's is simple, comfort food at a great price! I've had dinner/supper there once or twice and that was good too. If you're looking for gourmet food? Snooty trendy food?  Go somewhere else. Tommy's has some items on the menu that I look forward to trying so I'll be back!"}

{"text":"So three weeks ago this place formally known as Tommys has gone under new management and is now known as Lunas.  The place still looks the same and the bathrooms still look the same.  The food however has changed... I ordered some banana nut pancakes which was super dry that I could only eat part of one... I don't like soaking my pancakes in syrup so I couldn't continue eating this.  Along with my meal came home fries, eggs, and bacon.  Home fries was under seasoned but you could tell it was real potatoes... The eggs were soaked in butter so all I could taste was butter.. butter... And butter... Even when I added some hot sauce I could still taste the butter.. I was going to complain but the server never came back to check on us.  We also had to walk up to her to get our check which was kind of irritating since we waited 20 minutes for her to check on us but never did.  I just wouldn't come here anymore for breakfast.. just overall disappointed on this experience and how the food is now."}
{"text":"Had to deal with a horrible waitress Tabitha, all she wanted to do was cuss and complain about her customers. Even had a fork tossed from dishes they were carrying into the kitchen come for a visit at our table. Food was ok, I asked for a spinach omelet and got broccoli. Wasn't bad just had a craving for spinach. Cheap eats, HORRIBLE STAFF"}
{"text":"Do not allow them to seat you near the windows on a Sunday morning because they will forget to wait on your table. I observed three tables that were seated, served, fed and billed before I was able to get a menu!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Saturday. The place wasn't even crowded. Service is awful!!! Waited 30 minutes for our food that wasn't even good!"}
