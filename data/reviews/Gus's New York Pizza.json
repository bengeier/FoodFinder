{"text":"The pizza from this place is legitimately terrible. I'm the kind of person who will happily eat the worst pizza out there, but this deserves special mention for tasting worse, having a worse texture and makeup than the cheapest grocery store freezer aisle pizza you could find. I don't get how they make pizza this bad. I could throw tomato sauce and cheese onto a goddamn tortilla and nuke it in the microwave for 15 seconds and have something better.

That being said, their calzones and strombolis are somewhat acceptable just because they actually have to FILL the product with some ingredients (or they will give you sauce containers to dip their anhydrous product into), rather than leaving a dry, sauceless cheese on top of some stale dough like they do with their pizza. Their alfredo pasta is probably the best thing on the menu, and even then it's just because alfredo pasta is impossible to botch.

This place is good for two things: 24 hour delivery, and beer delivery. If you actually order food from them because you think it tastes good you are a nut. That being said, it fills an important niche role with those two things, and for that this horrendous establishment has a warm spot in my heart. Also, their delivery guys are always pretty friendly even at 4 AM which is pretty much the only time I ever see them."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE $$$ Had this pizza for the first time the other day at a work function. Decided I'd get one delivered. 3.9 miles away $5 out of area fee. WTF! ONE 16\" 2 topping with a side of ranch came out to $27. That's ridiculous. Could have gotten an XL 3 topping plus 12 wings at Barro's for the same price. Will not be odering from here again."}
{"text":"Extorted to write a good review, then had terrible customer service. Choose to not take coupons whenever.

At first, I had given Gus' a 5-star review. The pizza is good, the wings have an original recipe and the beer prices aren't bad.

They did however, offer a free slice of pizza for anyone who gave them a good review. Ethically, this is flawed, but since I enjoy the place I didn't mind.

Since then, they have been nothing but trash. I received a $20 gift card from them for showing up on opening day for their new location. The card did not work, and Gus' refused to do anything about it; jerked around with handling the situation.

Then the last straw was Super Bowl Sunday. Gus' refused to take a coupon because, \"technically SB Sunday is a holiday.\"

Reason enough to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great. I can't believe they have bad reviews Some might complain about the \"Authenticity\" but we have Hard Water in Arizona so our places try to make it as authentic as possible.

They are a little more pricey but it is worth it if you have the money. I don't care about waiting for it to delivery because if you are doing delivery, you can live waiting 45 minutes or more.

The staff is really friendly and I love going here after a long or early morning so the 24/7 is a huge plus in Tempe."}
{"text":"Placed an order online for delivery, and it had an option to tip driver via credit card or cash, chose to do it in person with cash. Guy makes it to our place and calls us and mentions that we did not tip them online, as if we had to anyways... You guys get paid minimum wage, not 4 dollars an hour for starters... And secondly, you don't rudely mention that we should tip you, even though we planned to anyways... Poor service everyone."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and two liter. I was charged $5 for a cup of ice. I will never order Gus's pizza again. If I was told ahead of time of the cost of ice (lol) with a one minute phone call, I would have said no ice but I wasn't given an option. When I called I was yelled at for questioning the price and told ice isn't free. I figure for $21, I can get some ice. Worst ever. Karma is a b."}
{"text":"First: The food here is AMAZING! 

BUT: The service is absolutely the worst. They are very, very rude, which doesn't bother me too much cause I can give it back just as salty. It's annoying, but it's not the deal breaker. The Dealbreaker is that they always try to upcharge you and you ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, have to remind them of the advertised prices. And they always respond with the \"Oh, YOU didn't say that.\" And they are ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS annoyed that they have to adjust it. 

It's just too annoying and so sad because the food is actually very good. I wish they would hire a firm to train them on how to treat customers. 

Double shame: They are open 24 hours, so they are a wonderful for a late night dinner. Just be prepped to know the prices that they advertise cause they will upcharge you 10-20 dollars if you're not careful."}
{"text":"When the original owner who was from New York ran this place the pizza was great this new guy change the recipe the sauce is watered down the crust is to thin the pizza sucks don't waste your time unless you don't know anything about pizza"}
{"text":"I am going on 4 orders the \"create your own calzone \"within one week, amazing, fresh, big, tasty. Made exactly how you want it. Any problem, its fixed and making sure I'm happy with my order no matter what. The employees treat customers great and when I call they know what I like and what I want. Chino  the manager has been the best, you know he has the customers wants first no matter what,  and is happy to oblige. Thank you for making a happy customer wanting more.  I always seem to get Kayla when I order I love that She is always so sweet and ready so easily to take my order she always remebers me from the last 5 orders  and knows exactly how I like my great testing xtra large calzone thanks Kayla you rock Kathy"}
{"text":"Pretty specific in what buffalo subs are out there. Some are too drenched or too strong. Buffalo chicken toasted sub here is how it should be!"}
{"text":"So I hate to write a bad review but I'm all for giving any place a review if it was anything below or above average. Honestly, this was way below average. The pizza was literally the worst pizza I have ever had, ever.. it seemed as if it was left out all day, it was hard and very dry & they forgot my ranch :( the only reason I gave two stars was because my cheesecake was really good & the delivery guy was bad ass, I liked his attitude & just all around good vibes. The guy on the phone whom I ordered from was also very polite and nice. Just really bad pizza. If you guys can fix that, then you would be grade A."}
{"text":"Gave them a try because it was my only option at 1:00 in the morning.  The guy on the phone was very friendly, quoted me 45 minutes to an hour, seemed a little long but you can't expect too much at that time of day, no prob.   It did take an hour and again that is what I was quoted.  
Unfortunately the pizza was not edible.   I was expecting bad pizza, hoping for good pizza,  and more than prepared for cold pizza. But this was my first delivery experience with horribly BURNT pizza.  We were ravenous at this point so we picked off some shreds that we could eat, and most of what we ate was still burned and disgusting. 
Low expectations have historically kept me from being much of a complainer, but seeing that useless pizza I'd paid for in my fridge the next day, instead of something to eat actually convinced me to make a phone call. The girl on the phone was friendly and apologetic, but had no authority to do anything for me.  She said she'd pass my information and receipt along to her manager and that I should expect a call. 
No call.  Enjoy the photo."}
{"text":"I love Gus's!! I work front desk at a hotel in Mesa and they always deliver in under an hour! Plus, they are open 24 hours which comes in handy when I work an overnight shift. The pizza is very good and their garlic cheesy bread is AMAZING. I recommend them for sure!"}
{"text":"pizza is horrible. 

depends what you like i guess.  if you like drinking  three cups of grease,  per slice then its great...

i hate it. 

i do not understand why people like this place."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, never again will I give then my business. Delivery took over an hour, by the time the food got here it was cold. The delivery guy some how had no change for money so I had to pay him way more than he deserved in a tip. The calzone had no flavor, they forgot the marinara sauce and it was disgustingly greasy. The wings are small and not worth the money. The buffalo chicken sandwich was the only thing that had flavor, which was extremely hot. Basically the place sucks and is a waste of money and time waiting for it. I wish I would have read these reviews before ordering!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place?  Me and my friend came here to eat a couple of weeks ago because the the next door restaurant was closed. We thought that heck, it is a pizza joint what can go wrong, right? Everything went wrong!!! Let me tell you guys what happend. While we were sitting at our table waiting for the pizza, a black gentleman came and was complaining on how bad the pizza was burnt to the owner. Instead of giving this gentleman a new pizza, the owner took the pizza and slams on ground and start cursing at black gentleman. The black gentle got upset and demand his money back but the owner would not let take and threaten to throw him out.. so the black gentleman walked out but the owner follows him making sure the black man gets out of his pizza place.. Owner should have kept his mouth shut.. but nooo, he kept yapping his mouth away and next thing you know, the black man knockout the owner. It was probably the most funniest/ and saddest thing I have ever seen. The worst part was that when our pizza arrived, we understands why the black man was complaining about the pizza. I would not recommend this place for anyone. Bad management, and bad pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two slices plain into Phoenix from Phila to visit my daughter at ASU. Funny thing is pizza in Phila is NOT NY Pizza, however I've been in NY enough to realize that damn near any NY Pizza shop will put most Pizza shops in Phila to shame. That said Gus's pie is, as genuine as your gonna find NY Pizza here near the left coast, short of traveling to Vegas. Order the plain pizza and enjoy it like a true New Yorker would"}
{"text":"Gus' was a staple of my diet for 20 years. It has been my go to since I was 16 years old. I even worked in the place delivering pies for a few years. I have many fond memories of the place from watching fights after last call to standing in the alleyway behind the place and watching a live girl on girl scene. I LOVE Gus' pizza. How could I not?

There have been many Gusses in the place's history and when it last sold (maybe 2 years ago?) I stopped in and told the new owner not to fuck it up. 

A previous reviewer said the owner talked about hard times? Hardly. Fortunately for ownership, and unfortunately for us, with a majority clientele that changes each semester and 24 hour operation this place makes a killing no matter whether the loyal locals continue to patronize it or not. Owners of this restaurant sell it for one reason: it has made them a millionaire and they are retiring. Ask Mo if you can find whichever strip club he's presently residing in.

On my last visit about 2 weeks ago I was crushed to discover that the Gus-du-jour has indeed fucked everything up. The crust is different and is not stretched as thinly, the sausage is different, the ovens seem to have been turned down and no longer create the same golden crispiness on the crust as before nor curl and crisp the edges of pepperonis.

Thanks for ruining something that was great you ass head. Bring back Nico and sell the place. I beg you."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Gus's. We ordered an 18\" half pineapple, half pepperoni pizza, 20 mild wings and a free 2-liter soda (with coupon). All of that for about $20 -- pretty good price!

The pizza was alright, the wings were very good. Not sure why, but even the 2-liter cherry Pepsi from Gus's tasted better than soda from the grocery store. 

The restaurant overall looked like a decent little place to dine. However, it may not be the best for quiet dining because of the loud music and TV going on."}
{"text":"I decided to chance it despite numerous bad reviews, and I can honestly say overall I'm impressed. 

The overall pizza is well balanced with the sauce not overpowering the cheese and vice versa; it also taste more fresh than other places around it. The thing that really got me was the crust; this is the lightest, fluffiest crust I've ever had.

The only thing stopping from a perfect rating is the fact that gus pizza has no warmer; meaning your pizza will lose heat really quickly and germs will grow. So make sure you come get your pizza 5-10 mins before pick up time!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a great atmosphere. We had a huge order and they somehow got it perfectly right. The employees were friendly and knowledgeable. If you want good food near campus, try this place"}
{"text":"If your intoxicated lol or super hungry and its really late and everything is closed.... This place is open 24 hours for  and they deliver also which is convienent for you... And also they have the best GARLIC KNOTS EVER!!! Lol and the best toppings on a pizza.... Try my special... Ricotta cheese,mushrooms,bbq chicken,red onions,meatballs..... It's bombskis!!!  If your on a diet...don't try it... Lol."}
{"text":"worst customer service I've ever had in my life. food is not the greatest, never in my life have i had to wait 2 hours for a delivery. don't take my advice, just screw up for yourself. hopefully they go out of business soon...because they really deserve it."}
{"text":"Literally the worst fucking service of my life. Waited 2 hours for our pizza and when the guy came and delivered our WRONG order and we told him about it, he said, and I quote, \"do you wanna wait another 2 hours?'

What the literal fuck. 

And to top it all off, our pizza was cold AF."}
{"text":"Ordered a large garlic, fresh basil, and fresh sliced tomato pizza asked for it crispy. A Cesar salad, and an order of hot wings last night.
After all of the fees added up it was around $40, after waiting for an hour we called to find out where the food was, and the employee barked at us that the driver was on his way. The driver finally showed up after 2 hours with a cold pizza, cold wings, and warm salad. The extra ranch and hot sauce we were charged for wasn't there,The pizza was soggy had no garlic or basil, the box was soaked in grease and the wings were dry and burnt to a crisp. The driver almost dropped our entire order as walking up to the door, he also had an attitude and didn't keep the food in a delivery hot bag.

If your looking for cheap food when your drunk, get a cab and go somewhere else or even get a frozen pizza, that at least won't give you food poisoning the next day."}
{"text":"Gus's in Tempe is one of the greatest calzones you can order in the southwest. Take my word for it! Get the XL Calzone with ham and pepperoni and you will not be disappointed. The delivery rates are a little ridiculous and slow at times but the calzone is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch because Sal's has been open only for dinner/late night recently. Terrible, terrible pizza. It was greasy ( as in soak through the paper plates greasy) and bland. Too much cheese and too little sauce. Overpriced for how disappointing it was. Would not recommend or try again."}
{"text":"It's cool how they are 24 hours! The food is terrible and I wouldn't even feed it to my dog!! Th
Next time I'll settle for pizza hut"}
{"text":"I'm usually a super content customer, and the pizza is amazing. However, I did try out the wings tonight and would preferably stick to pizza only. My order of flavors were wrong, no biggie, but there was no sauce on my chicken wings and it was greasy. So I'm not happy about the price I paid for plain \"hot\" wings. Overall, great pizza."}
{"text":"First of all the staff and management teams need a serious change. My order took 1hour and 15 minutes to get to my house and they forgot half the order.. than before I could even clarify that half my order was missing and I didn't want him to leave with my extra cash in hand without my food he tells me to call and leaves. Than the management team wants to make it okay by making me wait 25min which turned to 45min for them to deliver the rest. When I called to tell them I want a refund for tip and shit they straight didn't deliver they don't do refunds? Your pieces of shit and a horrible service. The food taste like shit and your fucking thieves. I hope your business fails. Go fuck yourselves.."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD PIZZA. I can't hate them for making it cheap (that's why I went there), but it's probably the most bland excuse for pizza I've ever had...the first time I've ever been unenthusiastic about finishing leftover pizza.

Service was fine, and it was quick - it's just not very good food. If your only care is filling your stomach on $5, then this place is for you. If you are actually looking for something that tastes good, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. There are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better."}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  I've never actually been inside the restaurant itself and the food is not going to win any international awards or anything like that, but it's a 24 hour place and therefore, it gets five stars.  

When you're coming down from your alcohol fueled night at ASU, call this place up and they will deliver you food.  Hands down they always have my back for this.  

Pizza and wings are freaking delicious.  Can't really get this kind of food wrong when you're still awake and hungry at 5 am."}
{"text":"Gus' has 24 hour service. And it's good for that, when all your favorites are closed, Gus' is open. It's \"meh\", the only thing great is the value."}
{"text":"Run away! A friend and I ordered their veggie pizza after asking for two other types of pizzas that they were \"out of.\" It took forever for the pizza to come out and the staff were a bunch of rude thug type guys. We should have known better since the entire shop was empty and all the other restaurants around them were full! 

The pizza, honestly, tasted like a giant saltine cracker covered in ketchup and fake cheese. And it is so not worth the price! 

Now, I'm not too too picky when it comes to pizza, especially when I've got the hunger pains (I've had my share of little Caesars and dominoes) so I was hoping for something a little better than fast food or frozen pizza. 

Rude staff, lousy environment of the punks just jamming to their rap, and a really awful pizza!

My advice, if you really need pizza later at night, try Hungry Howie's or Big Jimmy's pizza. Or, if you really need pizza at 3am and there's nothing else but Gus's, skip the meal and take a sleeping pill, wake up and get some better pizza somewhere else in the morning!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place, went in with my fiance, the OWNER claimed he has never heard of Groupon in his life, felt extremely disrespected by him just making fun of the Groupon when it was shown right to his face. It's in fine print \"merchant is solely responsible to purchasers for the care and quality of the advertised goods and services\". Highly do not recommend this place!!! This place is a fucking joke, I feel sorry for anyone that has to deal with this!"}
{"text":"Their pizza gave me FOOD POISONING...TWICE! I though maybe I had a stomach bug the first time.  The second time, I had to take off work the next day because I was so sick. NOT OK!!  I should have known.  The employees hands looked filthy and the place was like 100 degrees inside.  Pizza places use raw meat for sausage, so if the meat is sitting out in a hot kitchen for hours before it even goes on your food...well you do the math."}
{"text":"This food is only to be ordered when drunk and presented with limited options. Gus's is better than dominos but the margin is equivalent to the level of hick between West Virginia and Kentucky."}
{"text":"Bad pizza, poor service, long waits. Plus, they litter the hell out of my complex every week or two with their fliers, despite \"no soliciting\" signs. Clearly they can't get business by their yelp reviews (i.e. Actually running a decent business), so they resort to spamming the shit out of people. If there were coupons or something I'd at least kind of get it, but I don't think anyone needs to be reminded that often that a shitty pizza place still somehow exists."}
{"text":"First and only bad review I have ever posted on yelp but I am pissed to say the least about my experience here. So, I get off work late one night and get a call from my boyfriend and his friends who have been drinking and ordered a pizza from Gus' to be delivered. He tells me that they never got the delivery or a phone call or anything so they called to see what happened and the manager told them that the delivery driver tried calling them 4 times with no answer, to which my boyfriend replies they never got a call. So, instead of maybe saying \"hey, let's see if we called the right number\" the manager proceeded to HANG UP ON MY BOYFRIEND. Hmm that's some interesting customer service. This pizza is paid for so they call back and say they would like what they paid for to which the manager says \"you have 45 minutes to pick it up or it goes in the trash.\" So I end up giving the boys a ride to the store to pick up their ice cold pizza only to find out the delivery driver did not read the phone number correctly. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? These guys were trying to be responsible and have pizza delivered after they've been drinking but instead I have to drive them to the store to pick up their pizza after being hung up on and treated poorly? Now, I can understand people make mistakes but what really topped this ordeal off is the guys all got back in my car and said after they discovered they called the wrong number they were STILL RUDE. Who the hell is running this place? After you realized you made a mistake and made us drive to pick up cold pizza you are rude to US?! Like I said I've never even written a bad review before but this was just shocking to me. Gus', you may think you can pull horrific service on drunk young college guys, but I was sober and remember every second of this and NONE of us will ever be returning!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here....I really am a fan of Gus' s pizza...The food is delicious and customer service is awesome.  Place is fast and very clean!! Hope you get to enjoy Gus' s pizza soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is very much a greasy, by pizza. But sometimes that's exactly what you want. Do if you're not looking for pesto and artichoke goodness, this is a good choice. Plus it's open and delivers 24/7!"}
{"text":"If cheap is what you are looking for this is it... The pizza is close to inedible.  It definitely caters to college kids-- cheap eats and open past bar closing.  With the overhead of being open 24 hours no wonder they use such terrible quality ingredients.  (Oh, and if you live in an apartment the delivery guy makes you meet him in the parking lot.)"}
{"text":"I would rate the food as a high 4 out of 5, but the customer service is terrible. When you call in they are rude. When you go in, it usually takes 5 minutes for someone to help you."}
{"text":"Gus's never ever surprises me anymore. Walked in the other day for carry out and they charged me $ .50 for my credit card transaction. WOW !!!! They have all these crazy little charges for everything you can think of. 

1. Credit card fee ( delivery and carry out ), maybe even dine in? Don't know never eaten in. 

2. After midnight delivery fee 

When it's late go to Ihop."}
{"text":"What the hell? This place doesn't even deserve 1 star, but I guess I can't submit without it. I remember when you could get 2 chicken Parmesan subs for 10 bucks! Now it's $8 a piece, plus $1 extra for ranch that's advertised as an option for the sandwich, a $1.50 credit card fee, then another $3 for delivery?! What the **** Gus? tell your staff to SLOW THE HECK DOWN when answering a call. I thought I called a Chinese place when the girl answered, and after  eating this \"food\" I sure as hell wish I had. Never again! The health department needs to check you guys again..."}
{"text":"Its probably as authentic of a New York (city) style pizza as you will find at 5'oclock in the morning in a place like Tempe that is made by Chaldeans. Floppy, greasy, goodness."}
{"text":"i ate at the gus's pizza in old town scottsdale, and based on a few reviews i skimmed here, im sure they are related.. a 24-hr pizza lounge are you kidding me? am i in heaven?? NO. well, this place is next to uhhh myst? whatever that place is with the flames. would love it if those flames catch this shithole on FIRE (used to be sultry dogs). never before seen this building busy or close to having more than a few customers at a time at any given time with any given name...not surprised it SUCKED.

easily the worst pizza place i have eaten in town. granted i was a bit tipsy and its near 2am.. but, i ordered what looked like a sausage/pepperoni slice and some garlic knots, at $2.99, cause the breadstix usually tells me how a place fairs on food. the bill was $8 even. turns out i got the meat lovers slice for $5.01(?). could barely tell. it took them at least 5 minutes to heat up the slice.

the knots came out a solid 15 minutes after i ordered. jeez okay. wonder how long their so-called 32\" giant pizza takes to cook. this is supposed to be a 24-hr after-hour club party refuge?? jokes. 

anyway the knots did look impressive for only 3 bucks. 5 fat knots. to be honest they were cooked near perfect flaky on the outside, extra doughy on the inside. and the texture was amazing oh yeah!.. WAIT. eating them however was quite the opposite. completely and utterly tasteless. neither/nor with their garlic brush, garlic dip, or extra garlic salt. everything was so bland. the bread taste just terrible. even the marinara dipping was terrible and blannnd as well. i thought i had cancer or was having a stroke for a minute. i tried to concentrate on making it taste good, taste at all. not happening. 

now back to the slice. not impressed at all. to be fair, it did have a minimal 'taste'. for 5 bucks i should be able to see and taste the other 3 toppings i didnt see in the first place though. weak as eff. 

now the menu looks impressive with salad sandwiches calzones etc. the 'we serve beer & wine' graphic jumped out first thing. great advertising! \"ill have a...\" except the part where THEY DO NOT SERVE BEER OR WINE YET. ok. idiots. oh there was a girl that stopped in to order some cheese fries. i was like 'ohh good choice....' no deal. they dont have those either, or, they choose not to serve them at that time. the dude answered like it wasnt blatantly on the menu in front of us, and very unfriendly to begin with. again. idiots.

im giving this a 0.34 star just for being another ridiculous place for pizza when *pizza pie, joe's, and best of italy* are all within view, literally. literally! and those are all better even on their worst days. this only gets that much of a score since i didnt actually try all of their food. dont expect to either.

update: are you kidding me their website doesnt even seem to exist....JERKS!

update: really, so bad i might start picketing outside there tomorrow  \"soft dough, but please go! more pizza? hell no!\"

update: i made them their own old town page to bash. 

jeff out!

{"text":"Maybe they have better cooks past midnight, but me and my friends (all college guys) tried Gus' for lunch and regretted it. The pork was slimy, we managed half the pizza before considering leaving it in the parking lot. Afterwards we all had a great time in the restroom.

Hopefully the midnight shift has less food poisoning, more deliciousness?"}
{"text":"The guys that's work here are very helpful. The girl with short hair and glasses on the other hand. Is terrible, she's constantly on her phone and trying to flirt with the workers.

{"text":"Horrible customer service and crazy long wait.. It took 1:45 minutes to get my ordered pizza and wings. I even called back to see if the driver was close and the manager said he'd credit me for the wait.. Soo I called back two days later and the rude staff said we can't just give you free stuff cause your pizza took to long. You are better off going to get a frozen pizza. Don't waste your time or money!"}

Fresh and delicious- best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"I guess the restaurant was ok. we are vegetarians so we picked this spot. eh not bad. we ate in the diner, and it was quiet, and nice. however I think it's overpriced for what we had. and they charged me $.50 for a card swipe. way to go to raise my bill."}
{"text":"Their pizza isn't the best in the world but it's really good, their side dishes and salads are delicious and unique to the pizza restaurants in the area.  They also do 24 hour deliveries!!  Best marinara for dipping I've ever had, though, and their garlic knots are heavenly! We've only had delivery so I'm not sure about the diner itself, but ordering over the phone is always hassle free and their delivery drivers who graciously risk their lives to bring us our food are always friendly as well.  A+"}
{"text":"Oh, Gus's.  For the past 2 1/2 years I've lived within a couple miles of this place, so it's near inevitable that I eat here occasionally.  And honestly, it was okay the first couple times.  Except I finally had to ask them to please put the onions on my pizza BEFORE cooking it, and they grudgingly obliged.

The pizza tastes okay - sometimes.  They will bring you food at 3am when you are too drunk to get it yourself.  And there you have the nicest things I can think of to say about this place.

Service is always slow and sometimes bordering on curt.  Even if you go in to the drab establishment, it can sometimes take ten or more minutes to get a single slice.  Their pizza drips grease and will soak through the box.  The wings are mediocre.  I only eat here if it's 2am and my neighbor wants pizza.  Even then I can only handle one slice."}
{"text":"Positive first, my boyfriend and I enjoyed their greek fries and the fact that their delivery was faster than it said it was going to be.

Negative is that, when I called to place the order I asked if they could use white alfredo sauce versus the marinara.  The employee who answered the phone and was taking the order, had no idea what I was talking about and told me he would put me on hold.  That was fine.  When he picked up he said he could only do a ranch sauce, I then said they had a \"white pizza\" and chicken alfredo on the menu, so why couldn't I create my own white pizza?  

Then he proceeded to say that is was not possible, I said it was fine that I DID NOT want ranch and to use marinara.  When the pizza got here, it was ranch....

The guy who delivered was actually really nice and the greek fries were good as well, thats why I am giving stars."}

I had already had my pizza so I was like what ever, plus I was really drunk. My friend ordered it last week an I had the pizza when I was sober, god it was  horrible.  I say stay away if you can!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online at 7am and it was to be ready at 8 am. I got there and the guy literally wouldn't even sell me a pizza. Instead I got a 20 minute lecture on why it wasn't ready and wouldn't be ready and they wouldnt make one until 10am. When I asked for a refund he tried to upsell me on other menu items. When I declined and asked for a refund he told me I was very rude. I can't even rate their food since they wouldn't give me the food I'd already paid for!"}
{"text":"Placed my order at 7:12am. Called Gus's at 8:32 to check on the order and he told me it was leaving shortly, he had to wait for the cook to show up.  How does a restaurant run 24hrs without a cook on shift all the time?"}

{"text":"Being from New York, good pizza is hard to find outside of the state. Gus' is able to live up to the standards of somebody who enjoys New York style pizza. The service was excellent and very helpful. I would recommend this place to those looking for good quality pizza."}
{"text":"First - and last - time I will order from this place.  Place the order at 9, got it at 10. Unacceptable.  Delivery driver came without red peppers or Parmesan cheese.  Totally unacceptable.  Pizza is okay, not great but not bad either.  Gave it a 2 rating cause' it's open 24 hours a day, most pizza places are not open at all hours of the night.  Anyway, I delivered pizzas for a couple of years a long time ago.  I was working at Godfather's Pizza in Ahwatukee - at the time it was the ONLY pizza joint in that area and the only one anyone could order delivery.  I ALWAYS carried a bag full of red pepper and Parmesan cheese packets with me.  The delivery guy told me that \"you have to order that extra\". Whatever.  Other chains do that as well IMO it's a complete joke of a chain/pizza company that apparently thinks that a person should have to order red peppers.  Definitely not anything even close to the taste of Serrano's pizza, Papa John's is also much better and even Barrio's beats them out on taste.  I guess if you're drunk/hungover or high on pot and it's 2 am, a great place to call and have delivery, otherwise, there is definitely better out there.   As the for the Yelper that found metal in their pizza, people sue companies that refuse to respond and often-times win large amounts of money in such cases."}
{"text":"$9 pie with fees and tax was $13. Took an hour to get delivered. And it tasted like garbage. Highly encourage anyone to avoid this stinkhole. Even the delivery guy was a dick."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a place like this can flourish. It kind of shows that those who play by the rules don't get ahead. Awful, flavorless pizza made by sketchy jerkoffs and delivered by weirdo sketch balls who show up whenever they damn well please. Avoid at all costs unless you want diarrhea soup for dessert."}
{"text":"Pros: Always open, polite staff. 

Cons: Pizza did not taste good. Meat tasted weird......and crust was so thin the slices fall apart as soon as you pick them up. 

I wouldn't recommend it. 

I know I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pizza i've ever had. With all the local cheap late night options for delivery i have no idea how this place stays in business. It takes a lot or me to really dislike a place, but Gus's, your pizza makes me want to cry."}
{"text":"Not good at all. I heard from a co worker that they had good pizza and as a nyc boy I had to try it. The only the thing they got right was the size of the slice but that's it.
We tried to order the Greek fries and the lady said they didn't have lemon juice and couldn't make them and before I could ask for them without it she snapped just fries. A little rude but it's all good. I just wanted food. So I ordered two cheese slices and my friend got pepperoni and sausage.

 
It came out hot and fresh but also the crust was a little dark. 
I folded my slice and prepared to consume some great pizza. But as I took a bite from that slice it literally broke on half and the cheese slid off. Not very good. Me and my friend both agreed we could barely taste the sauce cause it was very bland. The pizza had no taste and was too greasy. I love a little grease like the next guy but this was dripping down my hand into the plate when i was eating it. I ordered two slices but only ate them because I didn't eat dinner. 
My friend didn't even finish his slices.

Skip this place. While the place looked nice and was cool the food was not. Try Venezia's instead on mill. Such better pizza and service. They should lose the NY in there name cause that was not NY pizza."}
{"text":"I usually love this pizza, I'm always super excited when I get to eat it but I ordered delivery tonight and the pizza was completely burnt on the bottom, couldn't even eat the crust. :( pretty disappointed. Had to use the marinara from my garlic knots to make the pizza less dry"}
{"text":"i think there are some pizza snobs reviewing this place or something, gus's is BOMB!

they used to have a deal here, the dorm room special (woa, not THAT special...) it was an amazing deal that enabled me to survive college.  the dorm room special was an 18\" one topping with two 32oz drinks for about $10.  WHAAAAAAT? how can you pass that up?  and in my honest opinion, i thought it tasted really good.

it's greasy, so if you're a pansy just pass-on.   pass, pansy... pass...

the inside can be pretty dirty too, but it's not like you'd come in here suit and tie now!  again some honesty here... i have seen a rat running around inside... i calmly told the workers, and they were a little less calm about it than i was haha.  never stopped me from coming back again and again though.  guess i felt the rat added the true NY character to the joint.

late night crowd can be a little interesting... a mix of really drunk kids and some ghetto characters just hanging out.  maybe an occasional hooker too... trying to lure the drunks."}
{"text":"The people who run this place are straight up criminals. 

I grew up on the east coast, and I was pretty swasted one night and had their pizza at a friend's place and it reminded me of the NY style pizza back home. I tried them sober and while the STYLE is there, the flavor is not. If you want pizza with the aftertaste of a bucket full of bloody vomit, eat at Gus's. If you want cheese with questionable expiry, eat at Gus's. If you want stale crust, eat at Gus's. If you want the folks who make the Jersey Shore cast look like British Nobility at the counter to treat you like complete garbage while you're in the storefront itself, eat at Gus's. 


The last time I got pizza delivered from them, it took them the better part of 2 hours to get the COLD pizza to my doorstep a mile and a half away on a thursday night. When I got there, I tipped the driver generously anyway, even though he was clearly baked out of his gourd and the pizza was nearly destroyed(seriously, did he drive through a destruction derby on the way? is that why the pizza took so long?). I paid over the phone with a card and tipped with cash. 

He took it upon himself to tip himself AGAIN on the signed receipt line. So I ended up paying almost 40 dollars for their smallest pizza with all the surcharges and double tip. When I called to talk to a manager, I was told that there was \"nothing they could do to refund the money\" but that he would talk to the driver and let him know that \"wasn't cool\". Yeah. No. Straight up theft and credit card fraud ISN'T cool. I told the guy on the phone(who knows if it was actually a manager) that his response wasn't even remotely appropriate and that I would be calling my credit card company to do a chargeback. He back pedaled and told me to come into the store and he'd give me both tips back in cash. I told him to do something lascivious with whatever hellbeast gave birth to him.

So should you eat at Gus's? Only if you don't value your time, money, health, dignity, or temper. 

You'd be much better off getting some pizza from Slices on Mill. Or Native New Yorker. Or NYPD. They all have the good New York style without all the garbage slathered on top. And for far cheaper."}
{"text":"Do not waste time and money on this horrible place. I ordered a piazza and a Greek salad for delivery. The piazza was burnt and the salad that was supposed to be topped with feta, olives, peppers..., was just a tin full of lettuce.
I called to give the place the opportunity to deliver what I paid for, but the so called manager could care less. He said, \"You'll have to take that up with Grub Hub.\" Grub Hub is the service I ordered from. The manager went on to say that he is busy and can't talk to me. I am so disgusted with the entire experience. I will never order from that Gus's again."}
{"text":"Ordered  a Stromboli from here . Terrible burn and greasy nasty , you be the judge . But they did bring me out a another one.  Garlic notts  were not the greatest . The marinara sauce what's not that great either but if you want a six pack of beer delivered to you in the middle of the night I guess it's pretty good."}
{"text":"So, we ordered from this place on postmates at 827PM on Xmas.  They acccepted the order then waited 30 minutes to cancel at 857 PM for a 918 PM delivery.  Postmates explained it was the vendor that cancelled.  Don't accept the order until you can deliver, unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"If this is what pizza is like in New York, if I ever visit NYC, I'll probably just get a hot dog or a gyro or something. The main issue I had with the 4 topping pizza I bought was the placement of the toppings. It's my biggest pizza related pet peeve when you spend over $20 on a pizza with 4 toppings and half the slice is just cheese. And I don't mean that the ingredients took up half of the space on the slice overall. No, I mean that if you cut the slice in half at the middle, the bottom half of the slice had some toppings and the top half was just cheese. Some of the slices had more of one ingredient than the other, or barely any of one of the ingredients at all. There's just no excuse for that. All toppings should be spread evenly throughout the entire pizza. And the sausage seemed like the pre-cooked, frozen crap you would find on a Dominoe's pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, was delivered in reasonable time.  Customer service sucked, I assume they were going for Chicago style.  Pizza was still uncooked dough in center, but over cooked ok bottom.  Toppings were expensive, but very few.  Disappointed fit almost $40 pizza.  I'll keep searching for my pizza place."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! The asshole guy who answers the phone and takes orders is extremly rude! He wouldn't take responsibility for his fuck ups and has the nerve to talk disrespectfully. He gave me someone elses pizza! Also gave me the wrong special and had the nerve to have a so what attitude about it! Never going here again!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to comment how truly kind Chino was! He was above and beyond in customer service, while some of his counterparts were being passive and rude to us. Chino came out with a smile is his face and it never stopped! Give credit where credit is due, and keep being positive chino :) thank you!!"}
{"text":"Friggin idiots.

So its 2:30. We ordered a pizza at 12:15 and they swear they already delivered it. We payed with a card, which means they delivered a pizza to an old man (that's what they told us) and the card holder's name is Laura.

They don't show up, AND they charge your card without ID or proper signature? Fuck these herbs. Go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"In the past I've been a frequent customer of Gus's and always found the pizza to have a distinctive taste but since they've gone into new management, I don't expect to return. My few visit in the past two months weren't pleasant, I've encountered rude workers at the front counter who seem like I'm making them go out of THEIR way to get my order, which is no more than a few steps away nonetheless. Workers stand around and seem to be hanging out so don't expect to be welcomed with open arms into the store, you'd be lucky to even get a smile. Seriously, that's how bad their customer service is. The pizza has always been good in the past, but I'm completely displeased by what I received today. Half cold pizza, sorta warm around the crust, but in the middle was dead cold. I had to toss it in my own over for another 15 minutes in order for it to be edible. I don't want to know what other undercooked foods they'll be serving me, if I could give this place no stars I would but since I can't it earns a 1 star rating. Never returning."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for a cold pizza, undercooked wings (Salmonella here we come?).  Every time we called they either told us it would be another 15-20 minutes, or they hung up on us.  

Whoever answered the phone could never hear us due to the noise, couldn't tell what they were saying half the time.  

They didn't give us the dipping sauces we ordered, the chicken wings were insanely undercooked, and the pizza was less than room temperature.  

This place plasters their coupon flyers all over town, but they can't coordinate their online orders or fulfill them at all.. This it the THIRD TIME we've given this place a chance and we have had an exceedingly shit experience every time.  It seems like each time they strive to do worse."}
{"text":"First off the lady who took our order was very sweet. It was a Friday night and they were super busy but she was still very professional and nice, whereas others would get pissed or annoyed of all the drunks. Anyway, the wait was a little long but she made it up by giving us a free slice. Great service made it all good. The thin pizza that they make we're pretty good too."}
{"text":"I really hate to write a bad review of Gus's because up until now I've never had a bad experience with them.  But the young lady that they had answering the phone on 11/24/16 at around 1:30 AM - 2 AM was the worst.  Not only was she rude...she rushed me off the phone when she said my card declined (which by the way Zio's took with no issue, so I know that she input it incorrectly).  I work front desk at a hotel right next to ASU and I see your guys deliver here all the time and a lot that comes from the staff at our hotel telling guest about your restaurant.  But no worries I will tell everyone to send the business to Zio's because I would not want our guests to be subjected to her nasty attitude, at least there they are friendly.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yelp's algorithm is not catching all the shills that have been put up to writing phoney positive reviews about this place because no real New Yorker (like myself) would ever eat this stuff. Like another honest reviewer wrote here, the only thing they get right is the size of the slice, which is large like NYC pies. There is virtually NO tomato sauce on them...only cheese! And frequently, they are burnt. There's NYC pizza, then there's Chicago pizza, then there's about 50 feet of crap, then there's Venezia's and Dominos's, then another 25 feet of crap, and then there's Gus's!

Just another interesting detail: the taste and texture of the crust on Gus' Pizza is like unsalted crackers they give you in the hospital. Remarkably bad and overpriced."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night and it gave my husband and I food poisoning. I am a repeat customer, and have been for years. I called last night to let them know about it, and the kid said his manager wasn't in so they couldn't do anything except tell the chefs. I asked him to have a manager call me in the AM, and no one ever did. I called back just 10 minutes ago, and was told that since \"no one else got sick\" that apparently I was lying. He a also refused to refund me, because I had already thrown out the SPOILED pizza. Horrible ****ing customer service. I told you I would call BBB and Tempe Food Poison control and the manager said \"go ahead.\" Wow. You suck! I just wanted $10 back for the toxic food you gave me, which left my husband and I sick all night. If you'd like to refund me, you have my #."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Tempe, hands down! Also, for those of us who just can't fully enjoy pizza without ranch, Gus's has the best I've ever had! And unlike most other delivery places, they never forget to bring the ranch! The employees are always friendly and the pizza is consistently delicious and hot! There's really no reason to order from anyone else, I promise!"}
{"text":"I am from  new york,i want to go back  but i am trapped here. dominos,is a better choice ANYTIME than this shithole,i know college kids swear by it and thats ok,but i asked for two slices and a pepsi   i am telling you folks out there in YELPland  the pizza had NO TASTE I AM NOT KIDDING,i put every  condiment i could find on the slices  but still nothing  WOW no good stay away"}
{"text":"I used to work at a place where we would sometimes get free pizza from them and every single time, the pizza was disgusting, and every time, I had heartburn and felt ill after eating.

People, the pizza here is just plain bad.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Good and large sandwiches. Restaurant was too warm to enjoy eating inside. Fix your AC!"}
{"text":"Alright, so the pizza is a 6/10 as far as delivery places go (not exceptional, but it's recognizably pizza). My beef is with my delivery order.

Ordering online forces you to give roughly an hour grace period. For example, I placed my order at 6:00 and could only request it as early as 7:00. My pizza arrived at 7:30, even after the hour long grace period the establishment had to have my order ready to be delivered on time. Also, it's worth noting that this was a Thursday night.

My delivery driver hands me my pizza and takes off. I come to find it wasn't the pizza I ordered, so I call the store to let them know about the wait and wrong pizza. I am told the delivery driver will turn around with the right one.

Admittedly, I had started eating the other pizza for two reasons. First, I had been waiting a while and was starving. Second, I didn't expect they would actually want the pizza back to then go deliver it to someone else, as there is almost no way it was going to be warm at that point amongst other concerns.

The delivery driver expected the wrong pizza back so he could then take it to someone else. The fact that this was a viable option in solving the great pizza mixup is alarming. 

Do not order from Gus's. Who knows, maybe your pizza could have come from someone else's fridge."}
{"text":"Typical late night greasy pizza. Not great, not bad. But, it is open 24hrs which is why it gets 4 stars (delivery as well). And hey, when your leaving the club at 2 am drunk....who needs gourmet food anyways? Garlic knots are worth a try and the pepperoni pizza is pretty ok too. Id keep your toppings simple seeing as the ingredients may not be the most fresh. I order late night from Gus's quite often and for an after hour spot, the delivery wait isn't too shabby either."}
{"text":"Living in new York City for several years eating pizza I gotta say that the pizza at Gus's is definitely NEW YORK PIZZA!  Today we ordered the 32inch pizza the pie was the size of our entire table! The pizza slices was crazy long that you need to use 2 plates for one slice of pizza. I was very happy that the workers worked quickly to cook our pie. They had it ready within 10 minutes. I noticed During the winter months like today the restaurant gets a bit cold inside it would be nice if ghey turn on the heat to stay warm. So thats why I rated them 4 stars not 5. Was gonna drop it to 3 stars but since they had tv's showing the football game it made up for that extra star lol.... the restaurant is fairly  clean and nice."}
{"text":"Kyla at Guy's recommended the white chicken pizza. It was awesomeness on a plate. The crust and toppings were perfect. Customer service rocked. I can't wait until I go there again."}
{"text":"For the past year or so I have been getting flyers for Gus's Pizza plastered on my door like bad graffiti, and while the specials looked good, I never had a need to order pizza often, usually one of my friends would order from Domino's. This past week however, my friend and I were hungry due to staying up for the second all nighter in a row, and decided we wanted pizza. Around 2am we called Gus's and ordered a white pizza with pepperoni, the cost on the menu stated it was about $16. After their fees for eating after midnight, paying with a credit card, delivery fee and tax they told me the total was 21 dollars and some change. It stung a little, but still was okay, after all, no where else was open. They told me it would be about 30 minutes, but I asked them to wait and bring it around 3, when we would have enough time for a break. 

3:30 rolls around and after two phone calls to see what's up, the driver finally gets to our place, telling me that he couldn't get ahold of my cell even though Gus's called me about 5 minutes prior. The total bill when I got my pizza was $27.63! That is sure a lot different than 21 bucks! Angry, I called the manager and he stated that in addition to charging me 2 dollars for delivery, because I lived a block outside their delivery range, they tacked on another 5 dollars. He then proceeded to list off several fees that I couldn't keep track of, and would only give me 30% off my next order for the \"forgetfulness\" that his employees had for not telling me the true price. 30% off.. pfft, as if I would want to be bent over and reamed by their gouging again. 

The pizza was cold, bland and the cheese had hardened into almost another crust, which was at least better tasting than the actual crust of the pizza. Now that I found other places that deliver late like Eddies Pizza Lounge, I will never look at this slum again."}
{"text":"5 stars if I was basing it off of dine in...people were friendly to us, great New York style slices and the fried pickles were great.. but I decided to get pizza delivered at 2 am and I didn't come until 4am!! It was COLD when we got it and it was only cheese pizza.. they didn't carry peppers or cheese for it so that sucked. But 2 hours for pizza when the shop is two miles away? Ridiculous"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't that great at all and neither was the weird garlic bread. 
Wouldn't recommend at all."}
{"text":"This pizza sucks. They put fried chicken as a topping. It is greasy and probably contains terrible ingredients because the quality is apparent in its awfulness. The staff is very unfriendly. It is open 24 hours but this still does not add another star because the people you have to deal with at those times of the evening are absolutely terrible. It is not a good experience to be there at 4 AM.

I've eaten here dozens of times when I was a fat, irresponsible college student. It's great for fat, irresponsible students."}
{"text":"Very upset by this place. Love their pizza. Ordered online around midnight for delivery. Called an hour later and told my pizza was out for delivery. Another hour later after it still didn't arrive I called again and they informed me it was delivered to an address that was not on my order. Informed them that was incorrect, and still had no pizza. They then said Oh yea, we haven't done this order. Cancelled order, informed $ would be back in my account 5-7 business days, still nothing. I called to find out what happened and told a GM would call me back. Still no refund or phone call. Their online ordering forum does not seem to be a good way to get a pizza you ordered. After calling twice and being lied to about the status of the pizza, and not receiving the refund or phone call, I am very dissatisfied. That isn't how you treat a customer."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain on here. in fact, most of my posts are positive. If your hungry, Don't get delivery from here took my pizza an hour and a half  to get here when I was quoted 30 minutes on a Tuesday night! Not to mention I live less than a mile away. My pizza was cold and there are a lot of other late night delivery places I could have gone to. Super disappointed, tired, and hungry. I will be ordering Oliveo's from now on unless someone contacts me and tries to make this right because the service I received was unacceptable."}
{"text":"You know how they say \"There's no such thing as bad pizza\"? Thanks to Gus and his gut wrenching, bowel stewing, grease triangle New York slice, there's actual proof this isn't true! Thanks, Gus!"}
{"text":"Gus's does make decent food. The salads are always on point! the subs are lovely. And YES it's the best you can get at a late hour. What else is *there, Jack in the Box?  Ok. I like JITB *sometimes*, but  Gus's kicks their salad's a$$es!

Don't hate. It may very well be a \"neighborhood hole in the wall,\" but sometimes that's *ok* too:) Tempe + ASU area + late night food = Gus's."}
{"text":"Pizza was sooo good. Delivery came right on time as well! Delicious way to end a nice Sunday evening with my fiancé."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one starI would. first of all we got a margarita pizza with no sauce on it with sauce on the side and then sprinkle of maybe less than a quarter of a basil leaf per slice with a ripped up tomato here and there. once I spoke with the manager of this establishment he corrected me that no the margarita pizza here does not have sauce and I said yes it does and he said maybe not here anywhere else in the country and then he said that the basil and tomato was underneath the cheese which I proceeded to rip up which was only oregano sprinkled here and there.  i've never been so dissatisfied with any place I literally leave five stars for an Uber who's a piece of shit because they need to actually succeed in life but this place does not deserve that."}
{"text":"Their cheese pizza is honestly my favorite. It's so simple and so good! The delivery was quick and the service was awesome! I love the fact they are open 24/7"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this pizza place not that the pizza isn't good because it is but their customer service is shity. So I call and order my pizza they tell me that it will be about 15 minutes so I get there in about 15 minutes I pay for my pizza I give the little chubby girl with the glasses almost 5 extra dollars for a tip which I didn't even get a thank-you 4, then I sit there and wait another 20 minutes for my pizza which I was fine with but then I asked if I could have some crushed peppers and Parmesan packets they didn't have any which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of for a pizza place not to have those they only have them in the Shakers so I asked if I could please get a little container that I can shake a little bit of red peppers and Parmesan in one of their 22 ounce container and she says I'm going to have to charge you $0.70 for a container I told her I gave you all my change and all my ones that I had for that tip I don't have any small bills and she said I'm sorry about that with a little smirk on her face she is just a lucky I'm a very patient person cuz I felt like punching her in the throat, I've never had a place be so petty. I definitely won't be coming here anymore...."}
{"text":"This place and its choice to litter our apartment complex with it's menus really sucks. I personally will never eat here because of the trash they leave everywhere. They always crumple up their menus and shove them into doors but half the time they still fall to the ground and get blown around. I wish they would just stop. Nobody asked for their solicitation and it is making me wonder if they are even allowed onto the property to do this."}
{"text":"Its an ASU rite of passage to eat here. Most of the times I ate at Gus's it was staggering over from one of the bars in the joint parking lot after a binger.  Man was that the best pizza I ever ate at 2am, burned the roof of my month and everything! A giant greasy slice of pepperoni pizza with some crushed red pepper sprinkled on the top, PERFECTION!

I tried them sober, and thats another story, but I still like to stop in and grab a slice for old times sake."}
{"text":"Their pizza is literally garbage. We ordered because of a flyer that they left on our door with deals and promos, but our pizza was burnt to a crisp! The bread is terribly dry, and the cheese is incredibly chewy. Our soda was warm (2 liter) and they gave us an appetizer that we didn't even order! They took longer to deliver than quoted, and didn't even come prepared with a pen. If you're looking for really good pizza and wings, I'd recommend Palermo's instead. Hell, even Little Caesar's is a better alternative. Honestly, the whole experience was trash."}
{"text":"As with most businesses, there will be good and bad reviews, and hopefully I can come back at a later date to write a good one. However, my first experience with Gus' was quite negative.
I ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again.
One of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be \"on its way\" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice. 
Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza.
Think I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get."}
{"text":"I finally decided to order from here last Sun Mar 19th. They always put flyers on my door even though there is a sign saying not to( in 2 languages) and I have called and spoke to a manger on two occasions about this. I ordered through Yelp! The delivery guy shows up I open the door & say hi, he hands me food walks off. He didn't even give me the chance to check my order or to hand him a tip. He never even spoke a word. He was cold and rude 
I ordered 10 piece honey barbecue 5 flat 5 drums ... I got 6 drums 4 flat. I only eat flat so I was agitated by this. The fries and mozzarella sticks were ok but not better than the ones at sonic. 
After them posting flyers on my door for 4 years almost every week I expected better for the amount I paid. I will not be ordering from here again and I sure hope you keep your flyers off my door."}
{"text":"I was doing inspections on vehicles in a parking lot and I'm unfamiliar with Tempe so I google delivery for sandwiches etc. in Tempe and Gus' s came up. The guy who took my order over the phone was extremely nice and very quick. The food was crazy cheap for such large subs. Much better than a subway turd. The delivery driver found us no problem.even though it was a confusing place to get to. Driver showed up earlier than I was told and he was really nice. Food was delicious. All three of that ordered had different foods and all were very satisfied with what we ordered.  Great place. I need to try dine in next."}
{"text":"Turkey dinner fiasco led me to cruise downtown Tempe at 8pm looking for food. Most of Mill was closed, so down University I went and found two places open next to eachother. One was Mediterrean, but after I ordered, I saw Gus in the back, kind of hidden away. I went with a simple order of garlic Cheese Bread and it was freakin huge and came with marinara and garlic sauce all for 5 bucks. This is one of the better appetizer bread deals around (see pic) and is great for sharing or in my case not sharing and having massive leftovers. Place was fairly busy on Thanksgiving night, but the bread was ready in 15 minutes as they said and although it wasn't turkey, it still will hit the spot on any day."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 
I placed a togo order on a Sunday so when they told me it would be an hour I figured ok lots of football business. The kid who dropped off my order first told me the price. I paid him then hands me my pizza and soda. He started walking away. I had to announce that I didnt get my wings. His response was \"Oh, Did you want them?\" Ummm yeah dude why would I order them. I asked for the money back and how much they where and subtracted it for him. 
I called GUS to inform them, a manager was put on the phone. She had the vocab of a high schooler. Her response was \"Well Its not like he was trying to be rude or anything, he would have come back to get them and bring them back to you.\" Then she says they dont do refunds. All I have to say is Really lady.

Anyways. There service sucks.

I opened my pizza and its cold. Dont you think if its an hr wait maybe you should cook the pizza closer to the pick up time.

Never again! I would rather have frozen pizza!"}
{"text":"They have the biggest pizza pies ever for just under $38. I'm from New York City and I approve this pizza spot 100%. The pizza tastes good and they always make it fresh as soon as you order it. Grimaldi's, Rosati's and Gus's are the best places to go to for Pizza in Arizona. Anywhere else is usually worse than  frozen pizza. This is my second time coming here and I'm glad I came back. The second time is just as good as our first visit, maybe even better. I can eat pizza from here all day long. Glad we moved closer to here, now we can come more often."}
{"text":"Pizza and salad were good. Greek fries were sad: soggy, with barely any fetta and seasoning."}
{"text":"I can smell the pizza sauce and dough before I walk in and it gets my taste buds going. Upon walking in I get greeted with a New York attitude and a slight grin. This alone tells me the pizza is authentic. And let me tell you, it's the best pizza in town by far, not even close. The guy making my pizza looked like he really knows what he is doing because the crust was perfect, the sauce ratio to the cheese and toppings was perfect, and the cheese was lightly burnt in spots on top as it should be. I would highly recommend this place to everyone because that's what's up with this pizza. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"So I couldn't tell you what Gus' pizza tastes like because they wanted a $7 service charge (before tip) on an $11 order to deliver anything.  Classic craphole that will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Gus's Pizza is delicious! Large slices, many toppings offered, the wings are amazing! If you like just a simple piece of pizza pie this is the place for you! You can buy a whole pie or by the slice!"}

Fresh ingredients !! cant beat the taste especially when its open 24 hrs !! 
I tried the supreme pizza. Great crust and sauce. I topped it off with garlic sauce yummmmmmm 
** Large slices of Pizza ***
 
Check it out :)"}
{"text":"I really should give this place a zero.  Im going to give it one star only due to the fact that if you walk out of the bar and you're hungry this place is available.  Other than that I have tried this pizza sober and it is disgusting.  Never go here, it's bad."}
{"text":"ASU's favorite pizza?  I think they need a new tagline!OK I get it!  If I can get pizza delivered at any time and I was some fresh faced whipper snapper Sfaced wasted!!!  Than of course good old Gussy poo would be the greatest thing delivered to cure anyone's late night munchies when they are open 24/7.  

I originally ordered for delivery but called 20 minutes later and actually went to go pick up my order because of a few not so good experiencs with pizza deliveries in in the past.  Knowing that at least they can fix it right away in person!  At least so I thought.....

I opened up the box and discovered wow!!!  This was as close to an awful piping hot mess with the smeared lipstick and bad breath!   We're talking cheese that had strong not so mozzarella cheese odor that was perhaps spoiled and toppings that weren't evenly distributed!  1/4 of the pie I ordered barely had much pepperoni.  The crust was a bit undercooked in the middle. This appeared to be slapped together by someone who had just overslept and realized they were late for their nap!  

You would think by being there in person to address fixing it would've been no big deal but sadly they were so swamped with orders.  I let it slide and just decided to cut my losses.  In hindsight I should've just asked for a refund.  3 slices were somewhat edible.  The rest went into the dumpster fire.  Based on the inconsistencies of the pizza I ordered at this location. This is indeed the russian roulette of pizza!  Eat at your own risk with a potential sleepless night!"}
{"text":"not the best pizza in the world, but not the torture chamber many our describing on Yelp.. lol. The pizza is very greasy and it feels almost undercooked most of the time, I am usually faded beyond belief whenever I eat at Gus's otherwise I would make a more logical decision never to come here. So if your just that wasted and need to consume some food before AM, come here and full up. Its convenient AF so I can't complain, but its pretty Shitty pizza smh."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss and the late night drunks are not enjoyable either. I have rolled up and seen many cops outside and I am curious as to what is going on for them to be outside a pizza place but it seems they have trouble there from time to time. I think the pizza is so-so, sometimes its pretty good and other times its garbage. I recommend Jamies Pizza and Pita down the street, better service, pizza and its quieter. The only good thing is the Gus's stays open all the time."}
{"text":"Terrible place they took forever to serve you and I had to threaten them I was going to leave and dispute charge on my card if they didn't serve me."}
{"text":"Gus' was created by a person I assume was like, \"hey man, college kids get drunk, can't drive, and want pizza delivered at all hours of the night.\"

Thus, there is this crap hole pizza place that is run by the mentally challenged.  At my high school it was the special ed kids that always served our lunches in the cafeteria, then all those kids moved to Tempe and got a job here.  The biggest problem with this place is that the staff is totally careless and incompetent and I imagine on some or all drugs during work. 

Actually, that's a lie, the biggest problem is the pizza is gross.  It tastes like when you make a frozen Tombstone pizza at night, take it out, then you don't want it anymore so you leave it on the counter instead of wrapping it up cause you want to get back to watching Hoarders on A&E.  

Then you wake up the next morning and you're like, \"oh, cool, left over frozen Tombstone pizza that's been sitting out all night.\"  So you put it in the microwave to nuke all the bacteria and get it out of the temperature danger zone.

Then you eat it and you're like, \"wow this tastes JUST like Gus' Pizza only slightly better.\""}
{"text":"Not so great, but 24-7, so can't complain about having an option in the middle of the night, or morning."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service ever. I would never recommend this to anyone. They use long wongs wing sauce it's better to go there."}
{"text":"My earlier review was written out of naivete and insanity. Sure, it's not worth it to drive to Gus's, but this place works for delivery in a pinch. Lately I have taken to ordering delicious spinach pizza with a side of garlic knots. My best dude used to work at this place and he claims the garlic knots aren't even that good? I BEG TO DIFFER. They're the best part of every Gus-related meal.

In short, this restaurant is great for pizza delivery, especially if you are too drunk to know the difference between halfway decent pizza and delicious pizza. I give it an extra star for routinely fast deliveries."}
{"text":"went and purchased 2 slices of pizza, they were big but they were paper thin.. id rather have a medium/small size pizza with some bite to it. The pizza was good, but wouldn't buy by the slice again."}
{"text":"Good Vegi Pizza, Meat Pizza was too greasy which lead to the disintegration of the NY style crust. but the sauce flavor was great and like I said, the vegi pizza was really good, they will deliver out of their area for a $10.49 charge which knowing ahead of time helps with the decision making process on where to order from.
All in all pizza had good flavor."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and don't order this pizza.  I've had pizza all over the country, and this is by far the worst I have ever had.

1 - Delivery took forever.  Website ordering leaves much to be desired - no \"ASAP\" option, only thing I had available was over 1 hour from the time of order - maybe they were just that busy.

2 - The pizza was horrible - crust was doughy, not cooked completely - sauce lacks flavor - overall just under-cooked.

I really would never recommend this pizza  . . . ever."}
{"text":"I thought I would be enjoying some of Gus's pizza on Super Bowl Sunday.  However, you denied the coupon I had and raised the price of the pizzas because it was the day of the Super Bowl.  This is completely unacceptable.  Congratulations on losing any future business from me."}
{"text":"Pizza was mushy , not like ninja turtle awesome mushy but rather ack thats all slippy slide in my moth hole  - taste was ok, topping seemed solid. but it was most def on my \"stay away buy open late, list\" I Could do this maybe drunk at 2am, NOW the WINGS - NO NO NO , the WORST ever, being form buffalo; and i take them pretty serious. but OK. IM in love with wings, just need to get my fix.

 They arrived box swamped with grease in and sadly out , had to put towels just to open, upon opening .... They looked ok overall ... BUT one single bite  - - - BURNT  never changed grease flavor (that deep absolute, stuck in the mouth for nights , absolutely appalling taste. Tried with the ranch (had no blue cheese offered ever for extra) just burnt grease flavor. Let me tell you, I cant get any from that taste outta my mouth or brain  ... its so off that it almost ruined by favorite food for life. 24 or so wings in the trash and im not even kidding but saying my pups wouldn't even eat more then or  bite or so  after. Id rather Gordan Ramsey take every bad thing in the cooler or the worst show and put in my mouth in puree form.

Guessing from the overall (all)  the grease has not been changed in several months. Not night or days, just not changed and all the wing blood and burned fry, is most apparent within. I hope its a bad night for them a few weeks ago. I like they are open uber later and can if needed deliver but - no way man, stay away."}
{"text":"PERFECT place to grab a bite to eat and beer before the ASU football game! I came here with about four other friends, grabbed a table, beers and ordered a 14 and 18\" pizza. Plenty of TV's to watch sports and a nice outdoor patio. 

The pizza is awesome, I can't say much for the pasta and other food they have but I'd recommend the pizza for sure. Thin crust and crispy! The service could be better and it wouldn't hurt if the employees would smile or at least pretend to care that there's guests in their restaurant. I'll be back for game day, but other than that I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizzeria (for the areas standards) the only pizzeria I'll eat at around campus, thin sliced, decent cheese and decent portions (a little pricey for a slice) 24:7 as an east coast kid this is a place I recommend to people  that don't know anything about real pizza"}
{"text":"Coming from a 24 Hour Town (Las Vegas) to the 'burbs of PHX, one of the things I miss is the plethora of late night and all night dining options. 

Gus's is close to ASU, which I'm sure gives them a built in crowd of hungry students to support their 24/7 operation. We were looking for something late night, and this popped up on Yelp, so we phoned in a white pie, well done. 

By the time we arrived, the pie was ready as promised, and they were jumping with orders and customers. Apparently they also deliver beer! 

The pizza was AOk, could have used some more ricotta IMO, but it was good enough. We would pick up from them in the future. 

* They deliver 24/7 *

** they deliver beer (don't know the deets) **"}
{"text":"My, my, my.... I can't believe so many people had crappy experiences with Gus's. It's a shame really. It's really big pizza, that's cheap and next to a college campus. I'm surprised I didn't see this place gleaming with 5-star reviews. A crappy experience is a crappy experience I guess though. 

Enough about that...

Gus's is one of the best places to grab pizza after drinking it up on Mill Ave. Since it takes a little bit more energy to get to than Slices does, the crowd is usually a bit smaller (though not any less drunk). The pizza is just pizza, it's not gourmet, it's not organic and it's definitely not meant to blow people's socks off. It's gigantic, it's cheap and, when loaded up with garlic powder, it hits the spot after making poor decisions at the bar. The wings at Gus's are also good and are best with extra wing sauce.

I've never really ordered from them so I can't say anything about those incidents, but Gus's is okay in my book...even if there is a nasty grammatical error in their name."}
{"text":"You want good wings!!!!!!!!
This is the place to go.
After searching for a good wing place we finally found it.
Wing Street, Hooters & others...
Don't hold a candle to Gus's Jumbo wings.
We order them \"Hot/BBQ on the bone.
I found Gus's through Uber Eats."}
{"text":"super bummed about my last order. It was a Friday night, they're busy, I get it. our order took a little over an hour which was the time quoted, so I didn't mind at all. the delivery driver is the only reason I'm giving more than one star, nice dude. our pizza was cold when we got it so now we get to eat microwaved soggy pizza.  we ordered hot wings and they gave us boneless honey wings, also cold, also a disappointment. I get it that you're busy, and I don't mind the wait, but if I'm paying 30 dollars for a medium pizza and some wings and waiting over an hour to get them at least keep it under a heat lamp before it leaves the store."}
{"text":"Last time I came, I had no issues, but this time they decided they wouldn't take a coupon (not expired) and said that they had changed the policy. The person at the counter wanted me to drive home, print the coupon, and drive back. Nowhere did it say the coupon had to be printed."}
{"text":"It was great pizza!!! Super fast service!! My only complaint.....its too quiet in there...needs to turn up tv or play some music : )"}
{"text":"Great late night crave pizza... awesome for college students. Giant slices, really nice thin crust, and the sauce is good. Not the best cheese on there but again, this seems to be great party or late night food!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative reviews I would. After struggling for 30 minutes with a website to order online, a function that simply doesn't work, I called in. I was then told that although I live within 5 miles of this establishment, that I'd be charged an additional $6 for delivery. Umm. No. Gas is $1.65 a gallon people!!!!!!  If you are only targeting less than 5 miles, it's clear that your goal is to sell beer to underage college students only. Because quite frankly the only reason I wanted to order your pizza was to have a 6 pack delivered. I'm 33 years old. News flash! The radius you deliver to is 87% underage children. Get a new business plan."}
{"text":"I must say, my first visit to Gus's wasn't so good.. I'm hearing that was because the owner wasn't in town..

He's back so I decided to give it another try, all SMILES. It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"The pizza we ordered took almost a hour and a half to get delivered, it was cold, missing toppings and our pop was flat. Also ended up being quite expensive!. We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Every single Friday this place puts a menu in our door, not on, they slide it in. It's intrusive and extremely annoying. We get it, you want us to order from you. It's borderline harassment. And guess what? Just on principal alone, we will not ever order from this place. I called once and asked them to stop putting menus in our door every week and they clearly don't care. Maybe instead of harassing people, they should focus on the food, looking at these reviews, it's not their strong point."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. This is not the pizza place for late night ordering. Save yourself the time and hassle and go somewhere else. I attempted to place a pickup order twice late night around 3:30 am after getting out of work, and both times they placed me on hold and never answered. It's called the freeze out; put someone on hold long enough, they will eventually give up. Gus' must not need the extra business."}
{"text":"Oh Gus'.  You are the stable of many a ASU student's diet.  And for that, I thank you.

Gus has a good selection of Pizza, Subs, and Wings.  They are very reasonably priced, and they have some fantastic lunch specials.

If you are in the mood for Pizza, then their best deal, by far, is their Lunch Pizza Special.  This can only be ordered in person, or over the phone, so do not try to do this on their online ordering.

Gus' serves a 1 topping Large Pizza for $4.99.  That's right.  A pizza that is actually made to order, not sitting in a hot plate over at Little Ceasers.  A full-blown pizza for just $4.99.  And this baby can feed plenty!  I have only once been able to split it among three people...  And we were all starving at the beginning.  

I would also recommend their Garlic Knots... These breadsticks-gone-twisted are covered in luscious garlic spread and parmesan cheese.  A must-have for those who love all things bread related.

The one downside is that it is fast food.  Shocking, right?!  This place does not have the highest quality food... But that is what you get when you aren't paying tons of money.

If you are looking for some decent pizza that will not empty your wallet, give Gus' a call."}
{"text":"I personally really enjoyed their pizza. The crust was cooked perfectly and they were very generous with their toppings. I highly recommend getting their meatballs as of the pizza toppings. Very reasonably priced and their pizzas are fairly big. Good value for money"}
{"text":"Alright, this place stinks. The customer service is terrible. I simply went into the restaurant to get a pizza and they accused my friend of stealing soda??? Like how do you steal soda from the soda machine? Instead of politely asking us if we had soda in our water cup they yelled at us from across the restaurant in front of about 10 people! How embarrassing! cmon let's do this privately and respectfully. I told them I would try to pay for the soda half with change and the other on my card because I had no money on my account and the employee yelled, infront of everyone, about my financial status! How rude! Cancelled my order and when I accidentally walked off with the number in my hand without realizing, they yelled at me! As I gave back the number, It accidentally fell and they screamed \"you're paying for that losers! Get out!\" And I never once yelled or talked back to them. In all honesty, I was baked and felt completely awkward and silent."}
{"text":"Was walking home and was surprised to see Gus's pizza was open. Stopped in slightly intoxicated and asked for a recommendation, Timothy and Jamie both chimed in saying there garlic knots and Bronx bomber were fantastic so I went with that and was extremely impressed with quality of a 24 hr pizza joint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm out in Tempe or Scottsdale living it up, I always make it a point to end up at Gus's pizza. The line is always out the door at 2am, but it's worth the wait, and the people watching helps it fly by."}
{"text":"The first couple of times we ordered from Gus's the food was pretty good but the last two times it wasn't. Last time it was burnt and was barely edible and this time they got our toppings wrong and said I didn't tell them right, we didn't get a receipt on delivery to see what I told them..needless to say we probably won't be ordering from here again.."}
{"text":"The pizza's so so... I ordered it at 8 and it was supposed to be at 9 but it got here late. Plus it was a little cold and I live down the street.. meh. I'm not impressed sorry kids"}
{"text":"One time I was drunk and ordered one of their ginormous pizzas with jalapenos. I had it delivered to me in the parking lot of a frat house. The delivery dude gave me the amount and I thought it was ridiculous. I think it was $18 or something, which in hindsight isn't that ridiculous but I had been drinking free keg beer all night plus I think I got at least one free roofie so I just thought I would go along with the \"Free\" theme of the evening. The delivery driver called his boss for me and put me on the phone with him. The boss said I sounded hot so he wouldn't charge me. So I got a free pizza. The pizza was okay."}
{"text":"One of the few places who deliver during my shift at work. I can get fresh food delivered at 3am thanks to them! 

The pizza is pretty good, but the onion rings are the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"When a pregnant friend wants pizza, then you had better get her pizza or else! So me and my friend Jill C. was on our way to Kiwanis park for our annual picnic and I let her decide what we were eating. Pizza!!! So off we went to her favorite pizza place. 

Now let me just say how greedy I am combined with a pregnant lady = two and half greedy people! We asked what the specials were and she said, well we have a 18\" two topping and 20 wings for $18. What? Sold!!! See greedy. Oh wait, we need an extra topping and extra, extra hot sauce and ranch sauce. See what I mean.

So we get our order and head over to Kiwanis park. I am not sure if I was just hungry or what but we managed to almost finish out the entire pizza and wings in about  1 hour. It was so good. The pizza was a little extra done to get the crust nice and crispy and the wings were good and hot.  If I am ever in the area, craving pizza I may just have to make a stop and grab a slice or three!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good ,but not great, the service is almost always slow and the place is generally a dump, yet for some reason I can't stop going back.  Maybe it's the fact that it's on my way to campus.  Maybe it's because it's the only place i've found near campus where I can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.  Maybe I just get a kick out of the fact that the middle aged balding guy (manager?) is almost always yelling at one of the mexican dudes in the back.  For whatever unknown, illlogical reason I just like this place!"}
{"text":"Previously I wrote a review about this restaurant in 2015, and it wasn't the greatest! But I always attempt to give restaurants second chances and I'm glad I did. Since my last review I have to admit that Gus's New York Pizza is getting better and better, and I'm not just talking about the food! I don't know what has changed in the last year, but even the customer service has gotten 100x better at this location. I still have my random mishaps but really its in college town so its bound to happen! The female manager is amazing ( Sorry forgot her name ) but she is definitely going above and beyond from what you expect from them! And a lot of us appreciate it so keep up the great work and please don't let me down, because I will edit it again lol EAT ON PIZZA LOVERS!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 16\" white pizza, a dozen boneless hot wings, and a chicken parm sub.  Being impatient, I scarfed half wings down and a slice of pizza before I left the parking lot.  Hot is a notch above sedatively mild (if you're a hot wing connoisseur).  Oh, as a side note, make sure you look well to the right side when pulling out by the Geno's side, almost hit a pedestrian jogging while as I was distracted while  greedily scarfing down yet another slice! :)

The pizza was just okay.  Nothing great, but definitely not bad.  When I got home, I ate half the sub, and it was just.... okay.  So, all in all, the pizza is just..okay.   The wings...are just okay.  And the chick parm is just.. okay.  They don't make anything bad, but they don't make anything horrible.  Again, like others I've yelped about, if you are a college student, or any other drunken schmoe, it will definitely suit your needs in that late hour of Americanized Debauchery, Gluttony, and Little Remorse for your bad dietary decisions.

Last but not least, make sure you wear more than just shorts when you pick up the goods, they apparently have a health code.  Imagine that."}
{"text":"Gus's Pizza is a place I revisit every few months for a reason I can't entirely define.

Their pizza isn't terrible at all.  I don't think it's gross or anything.  It is bland.  I ordered a few pizzas from Gus's that's sort of like... sort of like biting into pizza-like food with pizza essence.  The flavor was just weak for some reason.  It was like, and I know it's not physically possible, but it tasted like they watered it down somehow.  It's the only way it makes sense.

I have been surprised a few times and have had a pizza that was stand-out good.

Things to appreciate:  It's cheaper than most places.  Since this place is open 24 hours, you can pop in at all odd hours of the night and get a bite to eat with a few buddies.  Split the bill a few ways and you're really only out a couple bucks each.  Also, it seems like the perfect place to hide after doing a mob hit.

The first time I ate there, I was so drunk I didn't even know what the fuck.  It was my 21st birthday.  I was a little, uh... I was out of control.  I've been back quite a few times since then, most of which I have done in a sober state, so hopefully when they see me they don't think, \"Oh great, here's drinky...\"

One night I felt super antisocial.  I didn't want to go out.  I just felt like kickin' it.  I spent the night with my dog and I ordered pizza, then fell asleep watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles--the first movie.  That was a particularly good pizza.  When I was like 5 years old, when I REALLY would have enjoyed doing that, I never had a chance because my parents would be like, \"Do you know how expensive pizza is?!\"  Well, yes I do, and it's totally worth it.  

Being an adult kicks ass..."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for a while, recently I had an order that they messed up on. So I called them and let them know what was going on! The guy on the phone told me that I needed to take a picture of all the onions and peppers that were in my sandwich ( I asked for no onions and no peppers!) I did that took a picture and sent it to him. After that they were completely rude did not want to deliver the right sandwich so I asked for my money back. I called to try it again and order some food this morning when the guy answered he told me that they were no longer aloud to deliver to me. I mean really c'mon because you messed up my order last time, now they won't deliver to me! When I asked for a manager too he said no one was there and he is not sure when a manager will be in! As the guy on the phone said it we are no longer going to serve you by delivering to you! This is horrible customer service and I will no longer recommend this place to friends or family and I will no longer go back there!"}
{"text":"I like this place alot they're the only pizza shop to deliver at 2 in the morning. Just be careful when youre doing delivery because i had hair in my chicken and they didn't make my pizza correct and they didnt put all the stuff we ordered in box so i suggest you go in instead of ordering delivery. When we choose to eat in (Restaurant) i have no complaints"}
{"text":"Always get the New York calzone. They have always been consistent with their deliveries, service, and quality."}

{"text":"I have been going to Gus's since the late 90's the pizza is consistently good, they finally fixed the overcharging issue where they were charging a higher rate than current 8.1%.  They  only sell pizza by the slice certain times of the day and the slice I bought this morning was smaller than the it has been in the past.  My guess is minimum wage went up so they adjusted the slice size.  Bottom line Good Pizza with occasional issues with there service, prices and portion."}
{"text":"We ordered from here tonight because they put a flyer on our door this morning and my husband was feeling spontaneous. The pizza came hot and delivered earlier than we expected. It tastes delicious and is consistent with the New York style I'm familiar with. 

We will definitely be ordering from here again."}

I tried to place an order based on their coupons. apparently they're only offered between certain hours that have no occasion on their coupons. I referred to what was in my gate and they continued to be unattainable

this place does not stick to the advertisements they may apply to their blanket door service. if it were they need to educate their order takers and I will never order from them again party or not. FALSE ADVERTISING! SAVE YOUR MONEY! will send pics upon service.

in retrospect, the girl I ordered with May have been nasty but michael my delivery guy? 5 stars across the boards. tip him hard if that's your dude!!! Gus take note"}

{"text":"Wow. That's all I can say about this place. Just, wow. 

Well I'd love to say whether I actually *like* the pizza or not, but I wasn't given the opportunity...

So two of my coworkers and I order the 32\" pizza to be delivered. We work in a closed area so we explicitly told them to call us when the driver got there. My coworker told them *3* times the phone number. Other coworkers have done this with no problems, including to the security door.

WE call an hour later because we hadn't heard anything, and the driver answers the phone and tells us that he was there and called 4 times and got no answer so he left. Here's the kicker. My coworkers number? A MI number. The number that gets read back to him? A 480 number. 

So ok, whatever someone wrote down the number wrong. (incredibly off number, but whatevs) so we ask if we can just get a new pizza made and brought over and this time, with the right phone number. They tell us they can now deliver the *2 hour old, cold* pizza to us but they can't make another one. 

So you mean to tell me, it was your mistake that caused this and you can't remake another one? We canceled the order. They then told us they can't do a refund, they can only do a credit. Waahh???

To add insult to injury, when my coworker took to their facebook to express what happened, they deleted it. Who the hell does that??? No wonder this place has crappy ratings and they have to ask everyone on their facebook to PLEASE go rate them on yelp, urbanspoon and google.. Their customer service is one of the worst places I've seen.... Buyer beware. And be ready to do a chargeback."}

So here i sit, on a Sunday, we ordered again and it was HORRIBLE. There was no cheese, the pizza was cold, and the guy forgot our soda (we are still waiting for him to come back with it). I think our affair with Gus is over.  I will pay the extra 5 bucks at get Barros."}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms, moody employees, sticky tables, long wait times, poor customer treatment, bad attitudes, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. We order here weeklies- as ritual- for our beerio kart festivities. Sadly, our last pizza was so greasy when we picked it up half of it fell off :/
BUT! They redeemed themselves by gifting us a pizza on them with us only paying the delivery fee. They quoted us an hour as usual, but we received our pizza within 30 minutes, and it was fantastic. Exactly how you would expect your pizza to be. These guys will never disappoint, and IF they do (by chance) they make sure to correct their mistake. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I went in to the store and ordered a pizza to go. After waiting 20 mins I asked for an ETA to which they rudely replied \"we will get it to you when we can, just sit down.\" I waited 10 more minutes and asked again and they said they forgot to print the ticket so it would be another 15-20 minutes. I asked them to cancel the order and they said they would. It has been a week and I still have not received a refund. Do not go here."}
{"text":"The firat ti m e i vame here everything was great. The service. Food. This second time was horrid . I pre.order my pizza and nothing was done. I ordered it at 6.30p. The manager seemed rude. Not.onñy to me but others. Im not coming here again"}
{"text":"I received a flyer for them in a mail with some really good coupons. So I decided to try since they deliver. They answered the phone right away the gentleman on the phone was very helpful. There was a ton of background noise, but I expect that since they are located inside a mall. He said it would be about 45min-1hour but let me tell you I received our dinner way sooner. The pizza was really good the only thing I did notice was the crust was slightly burned in some areas. The deal we got also came with wings and they were bomb! I got mild and they were perfect and I say this because sometimes they will be super spicy even though you clearly ordered mild. Anyhow I received a good deal for take out on a Friday night."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizza's for delivery (pies were great by the way-- definitely worth it for the price ) but the delivery driver mike was an absolute douche. Accused me of not answering my phone but had no record of him calling me. Rude, unprofessional, ruined the taste and of a great pie. Will not order again unless manager contacts me"}
{"text":"So it was late night about 1:30a.m. and I ordered a pizza because I always got their flyers and why not try a new place. I was charged about $26 for an extra large pizza even though I had a cupon for $11.99. I was tired and didnt care to fight with the guy because I just wanted some food before I went to bed. Needless to say it wasnt worth $26 and I was pissed. 5 months later/today I just called in an order thinking it would be better and I dont have my hopes up. Hahahaha. I called in and the guy sounds like he is 15 and he could care less about my order or even being kind. Now dont get me wrong, I expect people to have bad days and its hard to present a smile when its happening. I tried to be as kind as I could and make it as easy as I can for him but he was still a dick. It seemed like he could care less if my pizza even got there. Plus it was $5 tax? Insane delivery fee. My thinking of what this place does/why it is still open is because it is the closest pizza delivery service that is open 24hr. I will report back if the pizza and wings are worth the money, fir the second time."}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you to the employees at Gus's pizza for the great customer service and the quality pizza they delivered to me. They were very polite and very helpful today. Plus the pizza was perfect! Thanks so much for the quality!"}
{"text":"Not sure who you people are that think you are getting some fantastic gourmet food at 5:00 in the morning but try ordering at 9:00 in the evening and you will be surprised :) We were very impressed with the hot wings and my 'authentic' sub was fantastic!!! The Greek salad wasn't amazing but not bad! Overall...order!!! update - we have ordered at least 3 times since starting this review and I have to tell you, it is pretty darn good! Not Spinato's mind you but good food and quick delivery!"}
{"text":"Great for late night IF nothing else is open and/or close by.  Never will I pick this place over Filiberto's, but it provides a bit of variety.  They deliver anytime which is helpful if you're not in the mood for booze-induced stunt-driving.  To each his own.  Garlic knots=good.  Pizza=okay. Pepperoni roll=it tasted good last night, why does it hurt so bad?!  Like a pissed-off ex-girlfriend, that pepperoni roll will take its revenge.

This place is not Gumby's Pizza, that's for sure.  If anyone even remembers Gumby's."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered from the rural location in about a year due to its God awful service while ordering the food, much like any job no customer wants to get attitude while over paying for a sub par pizza, granted the order is placed around 2 in the morning when you advertise 24 hours I expected the same quality food at any hour especially considering the price is the same regardless of the cold pizza and wings you have to reheat because the driver was given the wrong directions for the second time, keeping in mind two different drivers and the same rude person taking the information, I still left the driver a good tip but will never order from the rural location again I'm fed up !"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I have ever had.  Took forever to be delivered. Since I was at home, I was able to at least put some garlic & onion powder, pepper flakes, oregano and dip in into some marinara sauce I had in the fridge. Which made it tolerable. 

DO WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good if you like a metal fastener in your pizza without a legitimate apology.  We ordered a large pizza and in one of the bites came across the small metal ring.  We called, got a lame apology along with a statement that it didn't come from their restaurant.  We were told to email a picture, which we did.  They apparently don't have Internet and the manager told us he would look at photo at home and call the next day.  That was almost a week ago, guess they aren't into making things right by the customer."}
{"text":"Maybe if you stopped spending so much money on flyers and put that money towards quality food and employees you would have better ratings.

This restaurant puts a new flyer on my door almost every other week in the 1.5 years that I have lived in this condo. And I don't even live near the place.

STOP LITTERING MY COMPLEX!!!!!!!! This is called HARASSMENT!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible, if it wasn't 24 hours it probably would not even be open. Every time I go there the workers have a terrible attitude and are just plain rude. The food is always stale and nasty. I ate some onion rings there and the next morning I woke up with food poisoning. DO NOT GO HERE. I will never return. btw the lady who works night with the terrible eyeshadow is the rudest person I have ever met. If I could rate this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Had a friend that was getting pizza from here. We got acos from next door and just wanted to wait for our friend to get pizza to go so we could leave and go home. I was PHYSICALLY assaulted by a black man there because my friend didn't close her to- go order of tacos and the Scottsdale Police decided they did not want to assist at all because they were friends with a guy that ran pizza shop. Buyer beware. Assault is ok between Gus's Pizza and the Scottsdale PD."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Disgusting.  Also, they have idiots working for them.  I really would find it hard to believe that the owners had ever even been to NYC, let alone eaten pizza there."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, pizza is good for a late night hunger craving. I do know they charge an extra $1 for late night orders. They pass out flyers like crazy in our apartment complex. We got an XL 2 topping pizza for $14. Pretty good deal! And there's always left overs for the hangover the next day."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and fresh tasting ingredients. My husband and I had the Bronx Bomb and it was amazing. 

The service was good. Even though we went at 1 am! The staff was friendly and helpful. I look forward coming back or order in food for delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Who doesn't love pizza at 10 at night. I love the location and hours. The pizza is delicious and the service was awesome. I remember going here during my ASU times. Still an awesome place. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I wish i could rate this one star. For starters:
Our food took 90 minutes to arrive.
We had to call 3 times about it. 
We got hung up on.
We got rude service
Our whole order was wrong (and cold)
And a whole lot of other issues. 
This place is one of the worst and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Terrible service, terrible timing, and terrible taste."}
{"text":"I had a couple issues with my delivery a couple days ago, but the manager got back to me personally by calling me. I worked with her and she really came through and fixed my delivery issues. I appreciate how in tune this company is with their reviews. They really make it a point to take care of their customers!"}
{"text":"Average, or slightly above average, pizza. The selling point is that it's open all night and is with-in walking distance of Sun Devil Stadium, Wells Fargo Arena, and across the street from University & Rural light rail station."}
{"text":"Eat here on a somewhat normal basis. We love this place. Today we ordered for 9 people. All grown men. Got one 32\" pizza and a 18\" pizza. Everyone was full and super happy. We love their food. Thy people over at Gus's are always nice, happy, and polite.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"PROS: open & delivery available 24/7, friendly staff, quoted delivery time was accurate, cheap specials, online ordering, pizza was decent, soda was cold, & pizza was hot. 

CONS: can only place online order if you have a credit card, delivery time was 45 minutes, garlic knots were horrible, no choice for type of crust, & the pizza size was smaller then expected."}
{"text":"Lets just say the bug guy that sprays said not to eat there"}
{"text":"I lived off of Gus's pizza in the dorms. The pizza is good & incredibly cheap and the wings are some of the best I've had at pizza joints. An 18\" pizza with two toppings and two drinks costs less than $10 and delivery is free and 24 hours. Best of all the delivery boys are always, without fail, completely high and usually ask if they can call you after their shift.  Food & entertainment, every time!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible. Plus $8 for a delivery fee!?! Come on! Overall, don't waste your time. There's other better pizza places out there.  

Gus's pizza should be renamed. When your drunk and don't care about decent customer service, go here.  

Never going here again. Will definitely spread the word to others not to bother with this place.  It should be shut down."}
{"text":"We planned to go to the taco place next door but figured we would give this place a try.  I wouldn't call this NEW YORK pizza,  and I'm from Long Island, I know what NY pizza should taste like... slightly bummed but edible. Here's why the two stars... there were two guys busting their ass, a third guy (see photo) was doing less then minimum and what upset me is that he blew his nose behind the counter and didn't wash his hands but was at the register,  touching orders. Then,  he is gathering up all the garbage,  and goes right back behind the counter... seriously gross and lost my appetite. Hopefully,  the management will get on board."}
{"text":"How can you give a bad review to a place that will deliver anywhere, anytime?"}
{"text":"I've had this a few times since.  Delivery takes forever, customer service is god AWFUL.  Seriously, these people are such assholes.  You get what you pay for, and this place is still a ripoff.  Should never be more than a star."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience ever from these inconsiderate pricks!"}
{"text":"As has often been said, especially by friends in Europe and the Northeast US, \"Good pizza joints are rarely cheap...and cheap pizza joints are rarely good.\"

These folks must have been referring to Gus's.  

The call was placed for delivery...a large pizza and 2 dozen wings.  Delivery in about 35 minutes...pizza and wings of decent temperature.  

With regard to the pizza, this was just not worth the first bite.  Between the light dusting of cheese, the 9 slices of pepperoni on a large pizza and the rather boring as well as lightly applied sauce, the final disappointment was the crust.  Thin and chewy should not go together for pizza crust.

The wings...so sad.  These apparently came from a bag in the freezer...found at places like Smart and Final.  They are of all the pieces and parts, just very small, little meat on those bones.  Seasoning seemed to be a dry spice applied after the wings were cooked.  

Not so worried if they deliver at 4 AM..."}
{"text":"Really really really good pizza! I loved in Brooklyn for a year and had a lot of NY Pizza. This is the best pizza I've had since I was in NY. The service could be better but the one server was nice and turned on the NBA game for me."}
{"text":"Service is about average. The pizza was by far the worst I've had. The crust was doughie and lacking salt/flavor. Overall this place was ok if you're in a hurry and need a slice, but its quality is far below pizza chains(which I loathe). If you want new york pizza don't bother coming here!"}
{"text":"I just had this place for the first time and it was amazing! I had the large Greek calzone and it was huge! The portion sizes are absolutely insane! The onion rings were literally like the best I ever had and the NY Authentic sub my grandma got was also really good! I went during lunch time and there weren't a lot of people so I don't know how long it would take to get your food if other customers were in the restaurant, but we got our food relatively fast! I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to go again with my friends!"}
{"text":"Unethical business practices. It is one thing to charge .50 cents for every credit card transaction, or add $1 for an 'after midnight' charge...but for there to be no mention of such charges, or no signage indicating such charges...that is not a business owner whom I will ever support again."}
{"text":"Timely delivery. Gross pizza. Pizza is not that hard to make. If I wasn't so lazy, I'd have made it myself. There are plenty of other pizza places you can go to that is both similar and possibly cheaper in price while still a MUCH better pizza."}
{"text":"Awful pizza , not cooked all the way , doughy , hour and a half to deliver after they said 45 minutes , 6.50$ to deliver to hotel they have there menu in with phone number , just a awful place go to bed hungry your better off , junk pizza , worse then little Caesars ,!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I would say pretty authentic to New York Pizza.  Very thin, greasy, goodness!!!  However, the service was miserable."}
{"text":"Best 24 hour pizza shop in Tempe. I always get the Greek fries and one of the huge subs. It is not the healthiest, but they do have great salads!"}
{"text":"This was my first time being here and u had always wanted to try it since I work nearby. I came in an ordered  a 14\" pepperoni pizza. I waited for 40 minutes. But what I found most perplexing was when I ordered, I wasn't greeted, I was just stared at. During the silent transaction I noticed about 5 employees just...standing. Thee only one I saw actually working was a woman with tattoos, she seemed very stressed and all over the place. Probably because everyone else was just standing with their thumbs in their butts.

I probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"To Joe Q.'s comment. I was not under the influence when I ate that crap pizza or wrote the review. If you look at the other negative posts, they are consistent with my comments. Not sure what your agenda was. This is a forum to review businesses, not other reviews"}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service. I ordered through grub hub and they took it upon themselves to not make the pizza. When I called them the response was that \"I wasn't sure if you wanted the pizza\". Why else would I order it? I waited an hour and a half only to find out that the pizza was not being made. This is the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Each time I walk into this location, the tables are not cleaned from whoever was eating there before, despite there being no other customers in the shop. The men behind the counter are rude, unprofessional, and gossip about customers that leave the restaurant. I always order one slice of cheese pizza and one slice of pepperoni pizza, and both of the times I visited, they were a greasy mess. I paid good money for that? Combining all of this with the expensiveness of two slices of pizza, it leaves me hoping that one day Gus's will be replaced by a better New York style pizza place."}
{"text":"This was disgusting pizza, the sauce is horrible and skimpy as it gets on the subpar quality of toppings. I will never go back, not to mention the 2 hour delivery time at off peak hours, the rude driver didnt even have the pizza in a heat bag or offer an apology. I had to reheat it immediately just to take a dissapointing bite, stick with mello mushroom pizza or someone else dont waste your money, a digiorno is 10x better

Bottom line, Gus's uses the cheapest quality ingredients available, the crust is very very bland, the sauce tastes like its Frye's brand out of a can, the mushrooms are shrivled up.  I mean I am seriously racking my brain to come up with one positive thing about my experience and I can't.  

Do not, and I repeat DO NOT listen to any reviews on here saying it is good, its probably just the owners and workers, nobody and I mean nobody regardless of how drunk you are, can possily find this pizza worth a damn."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas I've had in Arizona! There is nothing fancy or complex about this pizza. It's just simple and delicious. It's the freshest and most colorful looking pizza I've seen in a long time. Not a ton of grease either. Seriously no skimping on the toppings either. We also got the chef salad and there is a ton of meat in here. Definitely going to order from here more often. Really glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the food. And we were completely blindsided with the price. We were on grubhub and their prices are completely wrong! The driver was over a half hour late because the dumb bitch who took our order didn't put the correct hotel or room number. Food was ok but not for the price we paid. Never ordering again. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Do you have a very late night craving for a slice of cheap and greasy pizza? Gus is here for you. Want some pizza for lunch? Go somewhere else. Want to have some dine in pizza? Go somewhere else... ANYWHERE else. I have had bad experiences with these guys being VERY inappropriate with my better half while we ate there. But hey, if I'm dying for some saturated fat at 3am, I'm still gonna look up ole Gus. 2 stars for being there when no one else is."}
{"text":"Hidden charges, flavorless sauce, crust wasn't cooked long enough, and they delivered the wrong toppings."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want late night pizza. It's sometimes a hit or miss, sometimes the pizza is perfect, other times it feels a bit under cooked. Service is alright but I don't blame them for working at 2:00 in the morning. The fries are great, but I don't care to much for the wings; they don't taste as good."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place that makes me feel like im back home!! They come the closest to NY style pizza than anywhere else in AZ. Definitely coming back!! Plus there super friendly. :)"}
{"text":"I honestly can't get enough. I went there one time only because I saw their lunch special (pizza and a 16 oz  drink for $1.99) I figured it was a good deal and I was starving. The people there were nice and I got my slice in 2 minutes (so far so good.) I finally sit down to eat, and my-oh-my, I fell in LOVE!

The next day, I'd been thinking about it and went again. I was scared that it had only tasted real good only because I'd been starving the day before. Nope! It was just as DELICIOUS!!! I honestly go there at least 3 times a week. They are now like my own personal lil chefs. When I leave that place I always say \"Thanks, see you tomorrow,\" and I mean it."}
{"text":"Went over and ordered a pizza to go. As I was waiting there one of the employees wearing a hooded sweat shirt and black hat wiped his nose twice with his hand and then touched everyones food. Never washed his hands! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Best damn place to get a pizza ever Best sauce best view of the mountain ice cold beer yummy"}
{"text":"Great pizza with an amazing lady, who could ask for more! ;) short review I know but to the point and effective I hope. Check this out! Don't worry chipmunks we're spotted. LOL"}
{"text":"One time I came here and my friend got a cockroach in their ice when they got ice for their drink from the machine. Gross!"}
{"text":"No more Gus Pizza for me after last night. The owner and manager are dirt bags it my opinion and I'll tell you why, I have ordered a Pizza here the last three weeks in a row, charged three different amounts for the same order and then the beggars want tip on pickups, umm no !
Last night, because it was Super Bowl Sunday, the prices were raised and the specials were unavailable, I told the guy on the phone, the Super Bowl is over in five minutes, I got I'm sorry sir. They were going to try and charge me over $21, for a Pizza that is normally $14. Not happening, I work hard for my money. I went to Little Ceasars Pizza, picked up a deluxe, for $6 bucks and I must say, it wasn't bad for the money."}
{"text":"Look, crispy crust, we'll cooked toppings and cheese, and a Pepsi to wash it down.  This place makes real quality pizza pretty much from scratch. All toppings sliced fresh, cheese grated everyday, and sauce whipped up like butta baby!!! Order any time of the day, yea that's right, 24 HOURS A DAY!!!"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, I was excited to try this place. Unfortunately I'm pretty underwhelmed by the pizza. There are lots of other better pizza places in Tempe. This is a drunk pizza run, not quality. Also, they keep leaving brochures in my door. Not cool."}
{"text":"Been coming to/ordering from Gus' since 2008 and those extra large pizzas keep me coming back for more every time. There are two super-addicting toppings I always order: buffalo chicken and meatballs. They deliver 24/7 which is also a big plus. My fav size is the 24\" but have also ordered their largest (32\"). Be sure to bring a party of hungry people if you order that one lol, you'll still have leftovers. Since they moved to their new spot there's a lot more room for diners to eat-in and they have plenty of large TVs for watching the live game.

My only gripe is that the quality of the pizza does differ from order to order. Sometimes the crust is so on point and other times it's a bit dry or burnt on the bottom. It's not a big enough deal for me to stop from ordering, but would make the experience that much better if they could find a way to make things more consistent."}
{"text":"So it seems that since Anthony has left, all that was New York has also flown east.  I am confounded that while staying at a local hotel that promised delivery within 30 minutes due to their relationship with the new owners, somehow the sauce was missing from my pie an hour later.  No utensils were delivered and the salad was a costly mess.  Gus would say \" Potay Ksana\"..."}
{"text":"Pizza came still not fully cooked. And the wings were fatty and not enjoyable at all. I will not be ordering from here for awhile."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last night from Gus's and there was a huge hole in one of the slices. They tried to cover it up with pepperonis. What was hysterical in a way but at the same time slightly annoying since I paid for a whole pizza, not a pizza with holes."}
{"text":"WORSE customer service EVER! My boyfriend and I were even staring at the girl working there wondering at which point she would smile. Everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible. It was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked. Seriously, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes okay. It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, and their prices are average. It's not much for \"New York\" style pizza. Their large pizza is HUGE, but their crust is flavorless. Their wings are okay, but not great either. 

Their delivery times are off. Sometimes they'll tell you 45 minutes and they'll be an hour, or they'll be 10 minutes early. It's weird. Sometimes they just wont answer their phone. Sometimes they wont tell you when they'll be there. Once, they actually forgot part of my order. In terms of customer service, they're less than stellar... for sure.

Why do I keep eating there? My boss wouldn't eat anything else! I think if I have another Gus's pizza, i'll yack! I would recommend Pizza Hut over Gus's... any day."}
{"text":"NEVER  again!!! $9.59 for 2 slices and a medium drink?? Plus, they serve disgusting Pepsi products to drink!! Are they crazy???"}
{"text":"I recently used Gus's for a catering order to my office for a training lunch. From the girl I called to place the order with, to the delivery guy, to the quality and quantity of the food, to the price, I was very pleased! I will definitely use them again and they have become an office favorite. People are already asking when I'll bring Gus's back again. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Just went in there at 230 AM, and asked Gus what his favorite sandwidch was. He says the philly, so I ordered it. Best philly I've ever had, and I've been to Philly! Thanks Gus!!"}
{"text":"The food taste nasty and I have been waiting for like 2 hours for the delivery
They said the phone number was not right which I checked it was right , I ordered several times, never happened before. And also I have to pick up the food in case of waiting for another 45 min. The boss won't return the delivery fee, he was keep saying that he need to pay the driver. It is none of my fucking business. Never order again."}
{"text":"Attitude problem! Seriously! Will not here here or recommed this place! Food? Won't know because their service was all frowns and slams things around. Have a problem or issue? It shows!! Everyone is your customer! Remember that!"}
{"text":"Be careful,  this place is shady.   They tax at the incorrect rate and the price for a special isn't what they charge you if you aren't paying attention.   Won't go back after several similar experiences."}
{"text":"Like eating a greasy piece of paper with pepperoni on it. That being said, it is pizza. Plus they're open late. Plus they sell by the slice (or maybe I should say sheet?)"}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly gross. Its so gross, its almost disrespectful, do they seriously expect people to eat this? Well, I guess they do expect dumb people to eat this, and the only people who are dumb enough to eat this I guess are the loads of ASU students in the area. Oh wait, it makes sense now, they are still in business because drunk ASU kids eat food from one of the few places that is open 24/7.

Do not get chicken as a pizza topping, its breaded chicken. Pizza dough was gross, soggy, not done well. The sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well. We ordered garlic knots, and well, the same thing here. In fact, the garlic knots had no garlic, there was just some garlic sauce on the side and some marinara (tasted like crap). I think I had the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I think frozen pizza tastes 10x better.

Gus's is disGUSting. I think if you wanted to make pizza at home you'd do a much better job even if you can't make microwave popcorn."}
{"text":"Gus's redeeming factor is that the pizza is available 24/7, and they do have a gigantic 32 inch pie you can dine in or take out (The boxes on the 32 inchers are incredible!). 

We walked in and were greeted by one of the staff, which I appreciated. Everyone else working there though, seemed genuinely unhappy and stressed about working here. Going up to the counter to place our order, we asked if we could get half of a pizza one type, and half the other on a single pie. Denied. So, we ordered 2 smaller sized (14 inch) pizzas and some garlic knots as an appetizer. Note that they will charge you an extra $.50 if you use your credit card.

The garlic knots came out first, piping hot. They were decent, and served with ice cold marinara sauce which also was just OK. Out of the two pizzas (Bronx bomber and Margherita), I preferred the Bronx bomber better in terms of flavor and toppings. The Margherita had some anemic looking, sparse tomatoes on it, with a fine dusting of dried basil. I couldn't taste much garlic on it either. The Bronx bomber was more robust with the meaty toppings, red sauce, and cheese. The garlic they used on it was a heaping amount, the kind of garlic you scoop out from a jar that's already pre-diced.

Overall I wasn't really wowed by the pizza nor the service here. But, if I'm in the area and it's late at night, I might come here."}
{"text":"*Checks bank account*

Still waiting on that credit to my account.  And still waiting for a phone call from \"the boss\"  and its been well over a month since the credit card transaction took place.  

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and mediocre pizza.  Save your money people.  Order from anywhere but here!!!!"}
{"text":"Got delivery to my hotel and food was hot and very tasty.  I recommend the meatball sub!"}
{"text":"Been going here since 2005.  Usually I get slices of pizza with spinach and tomatoes (around $8.50).  Back in the days, Gus's had thick bread-like crust before which I really liked.  About 3 years ago, they made their crust a lot thinner.  The thinner crust is probably more representative of the NY style, but I still preferred the bread-like crust.  So, 4/5 star.  

Still my favorite place."}
{"text":"It would be interesting to see what the sales receipts reveal about how many people eat at Gus's before 10pm versus how many get delivery (for a $5 fee) between midnight and 4am.  I don't think the pizza is very good at Gus's, so if you need middle-of-the-night chow, Geno's Cheesesteaks will deliver a freshly-made burger, chili fries, or a satisfactory pizza until 4am (Silver Mine Subs is cheaper and have a few decent sandwiches and deliver late too, but their cheesesteak is nowhere near as good as Geno's).  I see I've turned my review into the late night delivery wars-----it was inevitable, I guess.  Gus's will deliver beer to your door:  a 6-pack of PBR for $6.99 or Sierra Nevada for $9.99...."}
{"text":"It's funny----I had heard that Gus had good pie.  All I can say is it must taste really good when you're under the table.  When you are sober, it's pretty medicre pizza, folks, even if they do deliver at 3am....."}
{"text":"Great pizza and decent prices definitely enjoy this pizza place. Awesome selection and even offer slices individually. I will come back again"}
{"text":"The pizza here is horrible. I've ordered it a few times because it's open 24/7 and let me tell you, it's bad. Prices are great, but it doesn't make up for pizza that tastes like left over garbage dump pizza.

The delivery guys will NEVER bring the pizza to my door. They make me walk out of my complex which is quite large. I order delivery for to the door delivery, not walk, balance two pizzas and a 2 liter while trying to type my door code in... no thanks.

I also had an issue, which will be my last time dealing with these idiots. I ordered a pizza, it was never delivered, and upper management is refusing to refund my credit card of the charge. They have been giving me the run around on the issue for over two weeks, and now they are flat out ignoring me, and refusing to refund me."}
{"text":"Finding pizza places that serve multiple types of olives is difficult, but when I saw this in the menu I had to try them out. 

We ordered a pizza and garlic knots around 10:45 and received it within the estimated window of 45-60 minutes. The pizza was good with a nice crust and even distribution of toppings. The garlic knots were just okay, though they were more like bread knots sitting in a pool of butter. 

This definitely reminds me of New York style pizza, and I can understand why they're so popular."}
{"text":"Most ludicrous place I've ever ordered from. What normal human would start a sizing scale with \"large\" when in actuality it is the smallest size?! 
I ordered a large pizza thinking I was getting a large pizza, waited an hour only to get a 14\" pizza for 5 people... not to mention my garlic knots were burnt.
I would rather eat 3$ Tony's pizza from food city."}
{"text":"This place has sucked for years.  It was a sh!thole 20 years ago in the mid-90's but did the job for a late night slice after you've been at the bars. I haven't had this pizza in years - I have no idea how long - well over 10 years.  My current gripe with them is the constant flyers that used to appear on my gate each week.  They stopped for a while after I bitched to my Property Management that over-flyering was not necessary given that half of them would end up fallen off our front gates and blown around the grounds.  It was like the dorm with all this non-stop flyering. There's 180 units in my condo community ...they were flyering nearly EVERY WEEK, and a lot of the ground level condos have 3 gates (front patio, side patio, and back patio that's on the side of the building), and the idiot flyer guy can't figure out that a side gate, and/or a back gate that doesn't have unit number above it, doesn't need a flyer, but some condos would often get flyers on two gates, and on some rare instances, all three gates had a flyer.  I did a rough estimate about how many flyers they were leaving in my condo community over a year ...it was well over 9,000 flyers a year.  Are you f'ing kidding me Gus' ? Finally the flyering stopped after I endlessly bitched to my HOA, but then the flyers resumed again a few months later.  Eventually, they stopped again about six months later and currently I haven't seen a Gus flyer in months.  

Hey Gus', we know where your crappy establishment exists if we need you, but I would NEVER order from this place based on polluting our condo community with weekly flyers ...and secondary to that, the hour+ wait time to get average pizza ...NEVER will I bother ordering from this place. It was a sh!thole in 1996 when I was in college, and it still is 20 years later.  The original location was a dump, but they moved over to the former Geno's cheesesteaks joint arond 2014, so I'm guessing the place is cleaning because that Geno's location was fairly clean and the interiors weren't the dump that Gus' old location was ...but guess what, I still will never order from this Sh!thole. Order from here if you wish, but your best bet is to grab a slice going in ...but don't waste your time waiting on a delivery when you're drunk late night ...just order from somewhere else and save yourself the aggravation."}
{"text":"This place is NOT the same!  Paid over $5 for a slice with 4 toppings on it and the box would have tasted better. Next time I'm buying a whole pie at Papa Johns for only $11.00! 
I give this place a month :-("}
{"text":"The redeem didn't work anymore, they said! The pizza was ok. I came here just because it 24 hours open :)"}

First call a lady representative answered and said \" fuck this phone won't stop ringing!\" Then hung up..second time the woman answered and said \"shit\" and hung up again !. Third time a man answered had an attitude through the entire ordering process . Total would have been $51.00 order but my wife stated she didn't feel comfortable placing a good order when the employees hated their job so much! This company clearly takes the time to place individual flyers on our door and are so convenient ,however this was clearly s disappointment"}

My apartment is kinda hard to find and they never complain. 
Always on time even in the wee hours of the morning. 
And the have FRIED MUSHROOMS!
My go to for pizza in Tempe."}
{"text":"Wings and garlic bread were great. Garlic bread was the size of a medium pizza. Stay away from the pizza it was really bad. The cheese really does fall off that's not a good thing."}
{"text":"We started out with good customer service on the call. I was quoted 25 minutes...an hour later and my pizza arrived warm(ish). Tastes ok. Definitely a mall pizza place. Very oily. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I JUST SPOKE TO THE RUDEST PERSON EVER. Who ever SARAH thinks she is she's crazy. She called me expletives and told me to hold on after I kindly asked where my pizza was after It was clearly extremely late. I ordered at 8:42pm and called inquiring (kindly) at 9:58pm. At dominoes if your pizza is more than 30 min. late you get it free. I was willing to wait a little longer but wow the rudeness from \"Sarah\" who was managing tonight was literally intolerable. I'm an ASU grad and very sad and disappointed at an institution I use to care a lot about. Shame on you Sarah!  Please me more patient with your customers...."}
{"text":"The Pizza is delicious and is ready fairly quickly. The people are really awesome as well! Only bad thing I can think of is the parking lot is a pain to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Love it or hate it, anyone who enjoys long nights in Tempe will eventually end up here from time to time.

I can only describe my feelings for this product with an analogy. I don't like cheap beers like Keystone or Natty Ice, but sometimes the situation calls for it and, well,  it gets me drunk. If you asked me how much I liked it, I'd reply \"not at all\", but if you put one in my face at the right time, you bet I'm gonna chug it.

After a night of that, my friends and I would probably take a bunch of wadded up ones and spend them here. Obviously, they provide a necessary service--late night, cheap pizza for the drunk and stoned urban youths of Arizona State. For that, I'll be nice about the varying levels of disappointment I've been served here and hope they at least improve the crust.

Seriously, I've had crackers with more flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered twice, home deliver and had a horrible experience.  My order arrived in almost 2 hours, the order takers are highly rude and unprofessional! 

The bad reviews are here for a reason, ignore this place."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the one star reviews for this place. I mean, it's a 24 hour pizza delivery joint in the heart of ASU campus. It's a tasty traditional NY pie. It's perfect hangover food. They sell giant 32in pizzas and they deliver quite far. This is a family owned place, and they recently remodeled and changed up their menu. 

Gus's has always been fast, reliable, and convenient. From the looks of things, they are always looking to improve as well. They aren't pretending to be fancy gourmet artisan pizza. At the same time, they aren't some huge chain. The owners are cool, and I prefer to buy local.

It can get a little crazy here after the bars close, but that shouldn't stop you from ordering delivery. There's a reason this place is swarming late nights and it isn't just because it's the only place open (because it isn't). When you've been out drinking, this stuff hits the spot like nothing else. 

They have online ordering and great specials. If I were still in college, this would definitely be one of my main go-to places. It's probably more of a 4 instead of a 5, but I'm going with 5 for two reasons - it's a perfect example of this type of pizza joint, and it definitely deserves higher than a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"As a new Arizona transplant from Manhattan, my wife and I have only been in this area for 8 weeks, I think I know a thing or two about pizza.

While not quite Manhattan quality, Gus's is certainly close.

We placed our order online and it was delivered within minutes of when it said it would be.

While the pizza was a tad on the cool side, the pie had the look and feel of real NYC pizza.

If I have one complaint it's that the crust was a bit bland. For $8.99 for a large, with 4 toppings, you can't ask for much more though.

Gus's may be a different story at 3:00am on a Saturday when 10,000 ASU kids are ordering pizza, but I highly recommend it for a quick and easy weeknight dinner!"}
{"text":"We got there at midnight and ordered the Bronx Bomber and Garlic Knots.

We decided to eat in and not only was the service vibrant and friendly but the good was well above average for 24hr pizza.

Lots of workers, food was made fresh and served with a verity of dips.

Will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming to Gus's especially when Kayla is working. She makes my visits amazing and makes me smile and laugh. Everytime I come in she never fails to smile. She knows exactly what I order and how far I drive for the pizza.
THANKS Kayla for the AWESOME SERVICE AND WONDERFUL SERVICE:)"}
{"text":"Due to my downtown Tempe location I've been getting flyers from Gus's taped onto my door for years.  A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.

Gus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent \"service fee.\"  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.  

I call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18\" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.

I hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.

I tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.  

My pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.

It's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.  I don't care how drunk or hungry I may be, and how late it has gotten, Gus's is off the list."}
{"text":"Place needs to get their crap together... Literally ordered an hour ago and they still haven't made my order. And some fat brown guy with glasses was a dick about it."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but I just called to see what was taking my pizza so long and was rushed off the phone as the guy said \"I gotta run\" multiple times as I was trying to help him out with an issue with UberEats since I work in their office. Not impressed"}
{"text":"I wish the pizza you order in the box tasted the same as the individual slices you can buy Bc the slices taste way way way better."}
{"text":"So this place had been putting flyers on the door of my apartment so I finally decided to try them out,it took about 10 minutes on the phone to place my order because the guy couldn't figure out which buttons to press, when I gave him my address he told me he was going to charge me for an \"out of area\" fee, they put their flyers on my door ! I was hungry so I agreed to it , when the food got to me my fries were extremely soggy and their fried pickles had so much batter it wasn't even enjoyable"}
{"text":"Great economical pizza sometimes. It's really hit or miss. Last couple times my friends and I got it delivered the pizza was undercooked and had cold sausage on top."}
{"text":"So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.

I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.

When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.

The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  

I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"If you really like pizza, this is not your pizza place. If you're drunk and need food, this is your place. The sauce is bitter, cheese is similar to Dominos or so. I usually make it a point to just leave good reviews however this place bombards my neighborhood with flyers. We have a no trespassing and no soliciting sign that is always being ignored. If you work at Gus' I'm talking about Riverwalk. Please stop, the whole neighborhood is annoyed."}
{"text":"Ordered food and waited over an hour. Called to see what was taking so long and they told me they cancelled the order. At that point it was too late to order food. The customer service is atrocious so if you want to order food and actually get it go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza, pretty quick delivery too! Especially considering our apartment is pretty hard to get to and it was right in the middle of the Cardinals game and dinner--probably pretty busy! Actually pretty authentic NY style pizza, too. Friendly delivery driver is also a plus, and they deliver beer at a totally fair price, so I'll be ordering here again."}
{"text":"either technical issues with the yelp app or issues on the restaurants end. I ordered for delivery through the app at 3:55. the app told me the estimated time of delivery was 5:26. A couple minutes after I ordered, I received 2 phone calls from the restaurant and it just sounded like a butt dial because I could hear the employees talking to each other but no one said anything to me on the phone. after 5:26, I decided to call the restaurant to check the status of my order and they said they never got it. I was on the phone with this guy for 10 minutes because he was trying to make up reasons why they didn't get it. First he said I had a different number assigned to my order which is BS because i received 2 calls from them. Then he said they thought I lived in an apartment and because I didn't provide a unit number, they tried to calling me to retrieve it...it was delayed for 2 hours because of that? I live in a house...

2 stars because the quality of the pizza was great. couldn't give them 3 more stars because the person on the phone tried to make it seem like they were absolutely not at fault."}
{"text":"They are open 24 hours and deliver beer (Last phone order for beer is at 1:15 am). I appreciate this service because it keeps people who are up very late fed. It's not the best pizza I have ever had but it is so convenient and I have never had a problem with the service.

{"text":"We ordered from this place last Friday because we got an ad on our door saying they deliver BEER!!! Was trying to stay in that night and Gus's Pizza made that possible.

We moved here from Chicago and have had plenty of pizza in NYC over the years and I honestly don't understand the negative reviews about this place. Maybe the staff saw how the company was being looked at on here and made some changes, I say that because we were very impressed.

We ordered a large pizza with bacon and pep, along with a order of Garlic Knots and a 6 pack of Bud.

The guy on the phone was very polite and made sure he got our order correct, he said it would be 45mins to an hour, expected for a Friday night.

35mins later our pizza and beer shows up. The delivery guy was a little off, maybe had a \"pick me up\" to get through his shift, but needless to say, he did his job in a timely matter.

The pizza was amazing!!! Hot, Fresh, Good Crust. I never eat crust, and I killed this crust. Yeah, Clean plate club over here. It even heats up well.

Most of the reviews are not good, but we tried this place before even reading a review and we loved it. I say, give it another shot. 

Oh yeah, 24hr delivery."}
{"text":"Just recently moved here and found their flyer in the door so we decided to check it out.

Ended up being a 2 hour delivery time. Called an hour and a half in and the girl said there was traffic. Asked the delivery guy about the traffic and he said no traffic, just a busy night.... It's Thursday.

Pizza AND onion rings were soggy and chewy. We had to re-cook everything ourselves. Might as well run to your local grocery, buy a meal and your own beer, and call it a night.

I've seen a cloudy night with more stars than I would ever give this place."}

{"text":"Gus's Pizza is great! The new management is turning things around! Finally, an owner that cares about the customer's experience. I had avoided this place like the plague, but when I heard there was new management, I decided I'd give Gus's another try. Glad I did. No more long delivery times, no more bland pizza, and no more employees that don't care. I would definately recommend Gus's Pizza. I spoke to the new owner and that's because he came to me to see how everything was. I was shocked! The last owner was never present and noone knew where he could be found. I've seen a lot of bad reviews, but you should give Gus's another try. The new management team is up to par."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, it's refreshing to have an authentic New York style pizza available from so many miles away. The crust and the sauce always determine a pizza's value and theirs was great - not too thick and doughy bread -- a little crunchy and airy...and at the same time, with a rich sauce nicely portioned for the loads of toppings. I usually stick to minimal toppings, but getting a supreme pizza here was just that - great mix of veggies and lots of meat on every slice and best of all, not too greasy. Definitely will come back for more, and their hours make that super easy."}
{"text":"We ordered the anti pasta salad and chicken rustica pizza. The pizza was good but the salad was gross-- just ice burg lettuce with cold cuts. I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible stomachache so I don't know what's up with that but I'm throwing out the leftovers just in case. I guess this place would be good for midnight munchies delivered at ASU. If you're looking for a good dinner delivered, order elsewhere. Especially for the price."}
{"text":"I can't be any clearer about this: This was the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.

I understand the average review before my writing is 4.5 stars, but I simply cannot conceive of this idea. Somehow, after the first rancid slice, I was able to continue through almost two more slices before my disgust overwhelmed my hunger. I don't care if I'm used to great pizza in Chicago, there has GOT to be something in between..."}
{"text":"Evidently this place is open 24 hours a day. That's great. My roommate can throw up in the toilet 24 hours a day. I'm not sure I can tell the difference. 

Basically take the worst of Sbarro's and combine that with the worst of Domino's. Call it \"New York Pizza\" and you've got Gus'.

Which I always get a smile. And the food is amazing! My favorite is the white pie with garlic knots. Pretty delicious!!"}
{"text":"Finest New York Pizza in Arizona, next to Venezia's Pizza, of course.  I have never once been disappointed with my order at Gus's, and I have eaten there many times, at all hours of the day and night.  It's great for lunch, dinner or late night.  Staff is very friendly, and the place is never too crowded, so service is pretty quick.  Great value for your money here too!  Having traveled to New York quite often and having lived nearby for most of my life, I feel my credentials make me an authority on NY style pizza.  And I say this place is 99% perfection!  The wings and pizza are both delicious, and their soda's a perfect match.  One or two slices will keep you full for hours too!"}
{"text":"An hour ago, I ordered online for pick-up.  I had used their: 
Special #3  X-Large Unlimited Toppings.  Being the extremely famished person I am, I ordered some garlic knots and  my pizza with:  

Black olives, buffalo chicken, feta cheese, meatballs, mushrooms, pepperoni, ricotta cheese, salami, sausage, and spinach.

Upon entering the establishment, all I felt was warm sizzling air that Arizona is known for.  It would have been nice for customers and workers to have some AC going.  Anyways, I picked up my pizza and went home to devour it. 

My review:  

- The garlic knots, although extremely delicious on the outside, had no flavor whatsoever on the inside.  The garlic sauce they offer with it was extremely helpful as I had to drench the bread in the middle with it.   I must say though that I'm amazed at how flaky it is on the inside and warm and gooey on the inside.  Big brownie points!

- The pizza itself was very interesting.  It seemed like they tossed all my toppings into the center so while working my way to the crust, I had a mouth-watering explosion of flavor!  Yum!  But like the garlic knots, the dough itself offered very little flavor.

Overall, it wasn't bad for the price.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  It really seems like Gus is a water-downed cheaper alternative to NYPD Pizza!

Oh, and as a note, they charge 50cents if you use a credit card and a 49cents \"service fee.\"  I picked-up the pizza.  What service did I get?  XD"}
{"text":"This place is great for people who need some pizza in the twilight zone hours. Other than that, avoid this place like an illness. 

Service is constantly fucking up orders and then wanting to be rude about it when you address it. Pizza is never cooked long enough & is always soggy. 

Ordered a supreme with pineapple one night, drove all the way back to see they forgot the pineapple and then had the audacity to tell me they will make me a new one as long as I \"bring the other pie back\".

WTF? What y'all should have done is given me a refund AND a new pie for making me waste my damn time. 

This place does not value the customer OR the food, I will never spend a dime here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the philly cheese steak pizza and wanted to substitute the green bell peppers with anchovies. Instead, they substituted artichoke hearts. I ordered online but apparently my special instructions were mis-translated. Nonetheless, I was impressed with the quality of this new york style pizza, and will likely try it again."}
{"text":"Why aren't people happy with this food?... We are here on vacation. Ordered off UberEats. Sausage and pepperoni pizza, Hawaiian pizza and a greek style salad. Arrived in the time frame it said it would, hot and yummy. Kids loved it. I ordered at 12 on a Monday, so maybe lunch time food is different than midnight food. 

I will say these are quite large pizzas... so we have plenty."}

{"text":"A couple weeks ago, My friends and I arrived in Phoenix, starving, at about 1am with a 12 hour layover. We shuttled to a motel and discovered our only options were Jack in the Box drive-thru (no car) and Gus's. I'm not going to credit this place with an elaborate review. I didn't know pizza could taste this bad. I mean how do u mess up a pizza. I am not a food critic and I am not picky by any means. My friend could only stomach two slices and he can EAT! The pizza was flavorless, tasted like water just like one other reviewer mentioned and upon swallowing, the cardboard box seemed the more edible of the two. I'm not even kidding. 
I must also mention the price. I know beggars can't be choosers. I don't mind paying out the ear for a edible meal when it's a last resort. 
We paid $50. and change including $5 tip for the \"two gnarly pizzas and disgusting chicken wings special\".   
Included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee."}
