{"text":"This is a great little cafe, filled with Sun City residents & local merchants. Brenda runs the place, its not just a name, and the food it simple & comforting.  Daily specials, standard american cuisine and sweet little lady waitresses.  yummy"}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday little before noon. The place is pretty full. Always a good sign. I was by myself so went to the counter and I had a delicious meal at a great price. Service was excellent. Brenda was behind the counter working hard."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood family restaurant.  We had a delicious breakfast that included omelettes,  pancakes,    and good coffee.   Brenda  realized we were first time customers and she took the time to come over and say hello and make sure we were satisfied with everything.   In addition to good food and good service,  they are obsessed  with cleanliness.  This place can be habit forming.   We will try it for lunch next visit.  I will review the lunch as well."}
{"text":"Went here today for some lunch. When I got there the dining room was filled with maybe only 4 tables available in the place. After dining there I can see why they stay busy. Upon arrival I seated myself like the sign says to. I was greeted promptly by one of the waitresses. The service was great and I didn't find my self \"needing\" anything as they anticipated my every need. The food was even better! I had the corned beef Ruben and it was served very hot with a side of French fries. You can even add double the meat for a couple bucks! I would absolutely recommend this place for lunch. I have not tried their breakfast yet but I will surely be back for some.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I just had breakfast at Brenda's Kitchen.  The banter was friendly and a bit livelier today. Perhaps it is because the snowbirds have flown the nest and there were a few empty seats: Brenda and the crew had a chance to not only breathe but to talk with everyone.    I like Brenda's not only for the food, but the entertainment value and that feeling of being in a good friends kitchen, chatting with everyone; comfortable.   I recommend this place but if no new people go, that would mean I could always find a seat."}
{"text":"Excellent service and I loved the fish and claim chowder.  Keep in mind they close at 2pm.  Busy this time of the year ,since the snow birds are back."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time today. The food was real down home cooking and the staff was amazing. This is my new go to place for lunch and breakfast. Great menu and good food. Specials everyday!"}
{"text":"Wow what a find!!!! If you're looking for a local place to eat, Brenda's Kitchen is the place. It is only open Monday to Friday from 6am to 2pm but what a great breakfast lunch joint. In the heart of Sun City, most customers are older, but it is a hopping place. Very friendly and lots of laughter going on. Next time you want a homemade meal, check out Brenda's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great home style comfort food all made in house! Awesome staff waiting to treat you like grandma does. Hope you enjoy as we did."}
{"text":"This is such a great place.  Brenda and all of her staff sincerely like people.  The food is simple home-cooking, always lovingly prepared and fresh.  Service is friendly and warm, but sometimes when the restaurant is very busy, it can be slower.  No matter.  Everyone, including the regulars, is so nice you will just enjoy the atmosphere.  Prices are friendly also..."}
{"text":"The staff was great and friendly but food was slightly disappointing. Pancakes were bland."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant the staff is so friendly and the breakfast hits the spot. Im going to have to try the lunch sometime"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Stopped in for a quick lunch while in the area. Patty melt was one of the best I've had, and the cole slaw was super yummy too!  Staff was very friendly. The short time I was in there, they greeted most customers by name. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Friendly, happy workers. Good selection of breakfast specials. Food served hot, will definitely return and try lunch. Clean well kept seating area. Good prices. It's clear customers keep the tables filled."}
{"text":"Love Brenda's.  We've been eating here for years.  Its the kinda place that you don't even have to tell them what you want, they remember you and already know.  The food is consistently great.  Sometimes when they are slammed you may have a bit of a wait for your food, but it's worth the wait. Don't go when your in a hurry.  Breakfast specials are a great deal.  Just a great feeling of community and yes it's Brenda who will wait on you half the time.  My only complaint....closed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we found Brenda's!  Great service and food.  Nothing fancy, but always fresh, hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome as always great home cooking for breakfeast you can not beat the corned beef hash and eggs. Just wish they were open on the weekends.."}
{"text":"Ehhh maybe its because I'm used to the delicious tasting food you find in Scottsdale/Downtown phoenix but this joint is not one of my favorites. I stopped in after visiting my relative in Sun City and had the biscuits and gravy. They looked appetizing enough to eat but after giving it one bite I had no desire to continue eating whatever that was. The water and the milk I had were good I guess but that's about it. It is very affordable, but not even worth the $5 I spent."}
{"text":"This is not your designer chain food restaurant. This is what most people are looking for these days.  A local run restaurant that reminds you of the way it use to be.  Good food, good service and a clinking coffee cup feel good place!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Brenda's twice...once for lunch and once for breakfast. It's just a cozy small town diner type place...Excellent wait staff, that makes this a fun place. The food is not gourmet...just good diner food...made from scratch. Give it a try...not fancy...just good eats and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"CLEAN! Fast service,  ample diner selection, very reasonable prices,  well mannered staff,  no extra fluff.   Worth returning to visit this place.  It is a bit off of the main drag.  It's easy to see that the locals are in the know of this restaurant"}
{"text":"I love Brenda's it is a tiny hole in the wall restaurant in Youngtown. The staff is mostly mature women and the clientele just mostly retired folks. The restaurant it's nothing amazing but they treat you like family when you go into this place. They call you by your name and talk to you like they care with sincerity. I love businesses like this local that to it right. The food is very good and the prices very reasonable. We go to Brenda's all the time mostly for breakfast. This is a great place to stop if you are on the west side."}
{"text":"It's amazing every time! Food excellent. Service better than the food!!! Takes me back to a nicer time. Your order is hand written and the cooks call it out to the waitress that it's ready. Love it!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this down home breakfast spot. Brenda's is a place where everyone knows your name. As soon as we walk in the servers greater us with a smile and a sparkle in their eyes. It was like walking into my moms kitchen with simple decor but every bit of appropriateness. Brenda's is open M-F for breakfast and lunch, you've got to love a family business that gives their staff the weekends off. No wonder everyone is friendly! Sometimes you just need a simple menu in front of you which was exactly what you get. I ordered a country breakfast with French toast. Deliciously simple, loved the powdered sugar on top. So go if your in that area if you need to get fed and treated with a lot of love and respect.  I left thinking how important it is to hire people form the surrounding active adult communities because they know about customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. Omelette are really good, I got The Western and added tomato. Bacon was delicious and the biscuits are to die for! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was the best little hole in the wall breakfast place I have ever been to! Everyone was really friendly and welcoming! The prices were really reasonable for the amount of food you get! This place is the place to go for home cooking! Easily a no brainier to give this place a 5 out of 5 star review!"}
{"text":"A fantastic breakfast hole in the wall place! If you want some good pancakes and some southern hospitality this is the place for you. The service was awesome and the food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"A good breakfast for the money.  Staff very friendly.  A local hangout in Youngtown. The service is very good."}
{"text":"We are from California and yelped this place. Drove a little out of the way but it was well worth it. My son said his chicken fried steak was the best he's ever had! The service was amazing and they seemed to have a ton of regulars. Knew almost everyone by their first name. The place was a bit smokey which bothered us a bit but other than that we enjoyed our food very much"}
{"text":"This is a gem, a true mom & pops establishment. We went for breakfast my mom had the cornbeef hash and I had chorizo and eggs with corn tortillas. The cornbeef hash was home made and to point with taste, eggs even though scrambled they were real cracked eggs. I had the chorizo..I love to cook breakfast, this could have come from my kitchen right out of the cast iron pan. We plan on gathering the family and going back for another breakfast! Last but certainly not least was the service.  Lydia our server made us feel welcomed and service was phenomenal working right along side of her bussing tables and filling coffee's were the owners \"\"winner\"!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area in April. This will be one of our favorites to go to. The food is great. The staff is great, all of them are friendly, & fast. Loved there new special, Lemon French Bread. It was addicting. We have tried several things on the menu and all of it was very good."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to work too! Been here since 2004 and Brenda is a peach! Very unique olace! Join us for good food and a side of fun!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing good food old fashioned their corned beef has is different and good best I have had in a long time"}
{"text":"Been back many times since first review. Still love this place and I have to say the pancakes the last time I was there were amazing! We always leave happy when we go to Brenda's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!  I really missed these little homegrown cafe's that the mainland seem to have. The atmosphere is comfy and the workers are super nice. My family ended up coming here on Halloween for bunch and all the waitresses and Brenda were dressed up in Halloween costumes. It made me feel like I was at home and it was okay that I was missing Halloween. I really enjoyed the fact that I could watch the cooks make the food.   I ended up getting breakfast and so did my mom and grandma. I got to tell you their portions are HUGE!!!! I got a three egg omelet with bacon and tomatoes, home fried potatoes and a biscuit. All of it was delicious and a bit heavy. I could not finish it all. I think my favorite thing was the biscuit. It was light, fluffy and dense just a country style biscuit should be!!!!   If you don't come here for the service come here for the food. It may be tucked away in Sun City but I still would make the trek down here!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast !!!! Service was fast and friendly.  I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Don't quite understand all the good reviews! Went last Friday prompted by all the good reviews! We waited along with others to be seated! The waitress was friendly, brought us coffee pretty quick but waited a long time for food! It was pretty ordinary, not bad but nothing real special either! Probably won't go back, we keep looking for that special place with really good food, but can't seem to find it!!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp came through again! Brenda's is a great local place with good food and very reasonable prices. After trying several other local places, we finally found the one we will be calling \"ours\". :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  Great eggy French toast , perfect bacon, under $10. Love the small kitchen atmosphere, this place is awesome!   Brenda's kitchen: \"we burn all  toast, just scrape it the way you like it\" LoL"}
{"text":"This cute little mom and pop place is the best breakfast place in the area! My mother and I drove 25 minutes out of our way to try a new breakfast joint place and would definitely come back to this one! Super friendly, tons of regulars, delicious food! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friendly staff! I loved the vintage decorations and all the coffee mugs are different and unique. Today was my boyfriend and I first time and we enjoyed great food and great customer service and then we were surprised when our waitress told us someone did an act of kindness and paid for our bill, very sweet and appreciated!"}
{"text":"Brenda's Kitchen made me feel like I was at my Grandmas house for Sunday breakfast!! You could easily pass by Brenda's and have no idea that you have missed a great restaurant. Although the place is packed with people all day long! The staff is amazing! Prices are so reasonable, I couldn't believe how much food we received for that price, so affordable!  The special was Country Style Eggs Benedict, which meant amazing biscuits and gravy!! Portion size was huge and delicious! The chorizo and eggs were OMG!! If I could have eaten more I would have. Who knew a restaurant in Arizona would make me feel like I was eating somewhere in the South and New Mexico at the same time but Brenda's Kitchen did that for me!   If you are in the Phoenix area and wanting a good \"home cooked\" breakfast you have to stop in to Brenda's Kitchen! Plus they serve a bottomless cup of coffee that is good, it doesn't get better then this!"}
{"text":"My first visit and NOT my last. I had the polish sausage breakfast special with home fries, eggs, white bread, and (of course) polish sausage. It is a very good meal and reasonably priced!  I plan to return later in the week with my wife.  By the way, Brenda was my server and she explained the menu and thier specialties to me when she found out it was my \"first\" visit. Very nice!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The food is amazing and everyone is so friendly! The prices are VERY reasonable.  If you want a ' home away from home' feel , surrounded by wonderful people,  try Brenda's. It's home cooking that sticks to your ribs. Who knows..you might even meet a new friend or two. It's a magical place .  Thank you Brenda and crew! You are all doing a great job!  I plan on being there in a day or two!!"}
{"text":"Everyone was so nice and friendly. Definitely an older crowd. The food was just not that good. It needed salt and seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were the best thing but not as good as Peoria cafe. The Denver omelet tasted very generic and like the ham was from a can."}
{"text":"Brenda's Kitchen is fantastic for the Sun City crowd. The food theme is American Diner. The people are very friendly and it would be a fantastic place if you wanted to become a regular.  They have a different daily special for breakfast and for lunch. I like that. Today's breakfast special was Mixed Berry Stuffed French Toast. Lunch special is Sloppy Joe!  They have many different sides to choose from. Something for everybody."}
{"text":"Excellent service, really good home-cooking, cleaner than my own momma's kitchen (and that's saying a lot!) Bonus: they have grits for your breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service,,and the prices are low,,,I enjoy eating breakfast here,,the waitress are very friendly,,,thanks.."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast menu. It was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The place was small and cheerful and the food good enough but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Service was very efficient and relaxed! Loved the ambient and speedy service :)  Extremely affordable food."}
{"text":"This place is great. Older crowd but the food and prices are amazing. The biscuits and Gravy are a must! If you bring little kids prepare for all the grandmas and grandpas to come to your table and coo over them. It's quite adorable. :)"}
{"text":"Dad took us here ,said he forgotten  about this place. Great food wonderful  service.  Owner  is so sweet an friendly. Never would of known about this place if dad didn't take us thier. We're from Prescott Valley.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today with my father after searching for a lunch spot in the northwest valley. The place was quaint and the staff was very friendly. Very popular little joint with the older crowd. For lunch I ordered an egg salad sandwich with a side of bacon and mashed potatoes. The meal itself was okay. There really was nothing wrong with anything, it all was just very average though. My father ordered the baked fish and chips and concurred with my thoughts. I would give the place a try again but would not be expecting a lot."}
{"text":"Cute lovely little place and wonderful ladies. I got the Country Breakfast, It was delicious! Get the home fries too!"}
{"text":"I travel alot for work and i eat out about 20 days out of each month. That being said, we found a hidden gem of a cafe in Brendas Kitchen. We were only here the area for a week, but we tried to come here after the first day, as often as possible. As long as the great service and great food doesnt change, Brendas will be around for a long time. Im almost scared to post to yelp, cause now this small cafe is gpnna get over run. Breakfast or lunch, just go!!"}
{"text":"This must have high reviews soley because of its dirt cheap prices. I'm here on business and was fooled by the 4.5 star average. Honestly, you're better off at Denny's, and I loathe Dennys."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! It's a very nice ma and pa diner place that was packed when we got here, but very efficient so we didn't wait long. Lots of good small and medium (and large) options for very appropriate prices. My 2 eggs, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, potatoes and toast was $5.49 and cooked perfectly!  Ladies waiting on us were friendly and fast! If you're ok with country-diner type places you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time going, it was amazing!! Stuffed tropical French toast. Love how friendly the owners were. Wish they were opened at least Saturdays,  but for now worth the early wakeup before work!!"}
{"text":"Really hard working crew! Great food that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience when I go there. The food is great! And the gals are always friendly. I will eat there again and again............etc."}
{"text":"Fantastic little restaurant where you feel like family, the menu is very simple with all your favorites Brenda and Richard always say hello and thank you love this place. Ask Brenda about the Steve's special you'll love it breakfast"}
{"text":"I enjoy nothing more than stopping in at Brenda's for some good, wholesome food. The menu is simple and the food is tasty and fresh. I have never had  a bad meal (breakfast or lunch) here. The service is always friendly, quick and helpful. How often can you get a meal this good at a very reasonable price?"}
{"text":"Great food here! Plus the staff and Brenda were very friendly. I had the Chorizo burrito even though it's not on the menu they still made it for me. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very reasonable prices. Clientele is mostly older but it's a neat local place. An interesting find! It's not upscale atmosphere but the food and service make it a hit! Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Not only are the breakfast's amazing, the prices are very reasonable.  But the reason we love coming back is the staff. They are so friendly and actually remember us every time we come.  It's a restaurant full of regulars!  And we just love the unique decor.  I find something new on the shelves every cisi"}
{"text":"We love Brenda's Kitchen. We frequent there for breakfast often. Their biscuits and gravy are amazing! My husband loves their bacon burgers for lunch. Brenda and all her staff are very sweet."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and ample servings brought to you by a staff of really friendly and helpful servers. Even Brenda (yep, Benda the owner) came by to greet us since she hadn't seen us in the restaurant before. The place was really busy when we arrived but fortunately there were a couple of open tables. We were served our beverages right away and the food came shortly thereafter. The place is all decked out with Christmas decoration as were the staff. Our server Cori (a sweetheart of a gal) said they decorate for each holiday. Next up, Valentine's Day. This is a 5 star place for what it is: a neighborhood cafe taking care of the folks who grace their humble establishment. Its certainly worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Found Brenda's Kitchen while thinking about breakfast while at a doctor's appt. Thanks to Yelp.  It was close and the food was just what we wanted, classic American breakfast.  This a quaint little country kitchen with excellent food and service. Our eggs were prepared perfectly, the biscuits and gravy were excellent . The service here was phenomenal,  we were greeted and waited on immediately upon entering and were taken care of like we were family; everyone was. There were at least six tables and entered while we were seated and they waited less than a minute before drink orders were taken. The prices were also great and make sure yo u look at the daily specials , all really good deals. This place is a definite  come back and eat."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is awesome...then great food. A real down home experience. Definitely try the green chili omelet, spicy creamy and oh so tasty."}
{"text":"- - - DISCLAIMER - - - My 5 star rating is based more on value and service than it being the best tasting food around. But it is certainly not anything to complain about.  Brenda is a kind and bubbly lady and is there every day they are open, and her Husband, Richard, and Son work the grill.  Hours are only Monday - Friday 6:00am -2:00pm Breakfast and Lunch only!  Daily Breakfast and Lunch Specials. Homemade Soups Daily as well.  Decor is always festive! Decorate for every different holiday and most of the decor is something you'd find in great gramma's house or a yard sale. Definitely not trendy or chic but clean, quaint and comfortable.   Good down-home food. Nothing fancy like parsley on the plate but simple and good; a hungry man's breakfast you can start eating the second it is set down. You can't beat the prices of the Breakfast Specials from $2.79-$4.79. Pancakes, Soups & Biscuits made fresh daily and homemade Sausage Gravy is really good! Other than that, most food is unseasoned (remember the bulk of clientele is the senior crowd;) but still satisfying.    Though the patrons and wait staff are mainly seniors, they love to see young couples and kids in there. I bring 5 of 6 kids when they are on breaks or days off from school and have paid around $20 tip INCLUDED for 6 people to eat, Unheard of!!!  We have easily paid double that at IHOP or Cracker Barrel and Brenda's food is just as good and service is friendlier.   Last time we visited there was a full house and we had to wait for a table but still was eating in under 20min. Not bad. ;)  Well worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"Great Home Cooking. About 5 minutes off 101 but worth it. Biscuits and peppery gravy, eggs   It was very popular with older locals folks. Lunch specials looked very interesting for example green bean and hamburger soup."}
{"text":"Local breakfast joint serving homemade breakfast items. For a restaurant in Sun City, this place was hopping. Friendly service, coffee is always hot and fresh and prices are decent for the amount was delicious food there was, so check the place out when your in the West Valley and avoid those pretentious chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed without the help of Yelp and I am so happy that I found it.  This is just a place that you have to experience for the atmosphere, great food, and awesome staff."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is great and the Service even better!! And you can't beat the prices!!   We are normally the youngest ones at breakfasts!! But we love the place and we have been here in AZ all of 20 days and have gone 3 Times !!   Thanks to this place we feel like we found a replacement for a place back home!!   A place that feels like home !!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place to grab breakfast. My wife and I tried it out this morning and were impressed by the food and service. This is just good basic American food. It's nothing fancy and it really doesn't need to be. We will be back! We live in Peoria, so it wasn't really that far, and it certainly wasn't pricey."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Brenda's Kitchen for years and it just keeps getting better and better.  I didn't want to write a review because we kind of wanted to keep this place a secret just for ourselves.  However, the food is fabulous, and you are always greeted as if you are family.  Thank you so much Brenda and crew."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   Prices very reasonable.  Staff is friendly and owners amazing.  First time there yet felt like we had been going for years.   The food was excellent and in good size portions.   It appeared and verified by Staff everything is handmade there.    Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Good food. People are warm and it's like a small Midwest diner.  Service great and they treat you like family. We drive 30 miles to enjoy the warmth and genuine feeling they put into our visit. A gem off the beaten path.   Don't miss Brenda's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great prices, food, and hospitality. Classic diner, generous portions. Biscuits and gravy are great. Pancakes are really good also."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and will definitely go back. Good is priced very reasonable. Locals all know and love her. Feels good to support a small woman owned business."}
{"text":"Just got into town and was looking for food close by. Went here based on previous reviews and it worked out great! The food was delicious (we got breakfast food) and it was out to us very quickly. The place isn't big but it was a nice and relaxed atmosphere and the staff was excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"Friends brought us here for lunch today (we're visiting from.Oregon). The greeting as we entered was immediate, warm, and friendly. The waitresses were wonderfully cordial and helpful. The food was even better. Good home style cooking and full of flavor. Enjoyed every bite. While not fancy, it's clean and the gals make it fun. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Went to Brenda's for the first time yesterday.  It was like eating in a friend's kitchen.  The food was really good, and all the servers were friendly without being annoying.  Plus, they have a counter for the regulars.  Who doesn't want to eat biscuits and gravy at the counter with the regulars?  Love this place.  Will be going back Friday for the fish fry."}
{"text":"Great all American breakfast and lunch with friendly prompt service!  Only wish they had Eggs Benedict on the menu instead of as a special!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Brenda's after a doctors appointment to fill up on a some good home cooked breakfast. My breakfast (scrambled eggs and bacon with whole wheat toast) was delicious and fresh. I felt like I was transported to a friendly diner somewhere in Iowa (Brenda is from North Dakota), so much so that I half expected some presidential candidates to walk in the door. Don't miss this hidden gem. The home made desserts sound amazing. Mine was...an individual banana cream pie."}
{"text":"Smart and friendly staff. Lots of regulars that is a dead indicator that this place is legit. The omelette that I had was perfect, filling was perfect."}
{"text":"We found Brenda's on Yelp and were really happy with our breakfast!  All the people who worked there were super friendly and made us feel like regulars, even though it was our first time there.  My daughter got the 2 egg breakfast that came with bacon, sausage and French toast.  The portion was very generous so she was even willing to give my husband and me a slice of the French toast.  It was super soft and yummy.  Their homemade biscuits are really good and so was the veggie omelet.  We even ordered a bowl of the clam chowder (not one of our typical breakfast choices, but they made it in house and our waitress told us it was delicious so we couldn't resist.  Definitely worth it!  Yummm!)  We're from out of town, but will definitely go back to Brenda's next time we visit:)"}
{"text":"I love Brenda and her staff. Always friendly and funny too. They know most of their regulars by name and get their coffee right away and I have even witnessed a waitress having his food cooking the moment he came in. She asked if he wanted the usual and he said yes.  The food is always home cooked fresh. Never had a problem. I am always leary about sausage patties. But Brenda said just try them. They aren't anything like you get at food chains. She was right. They were just the right spice, tender and very tasty. I brought my sister in laws that were visiting from upstate NY and they loved it.  The waitress wasn't busy so my sis asked her to sit down a minute. She had us busting our guts with jokes and sweetness.  If your looking for the best home cooked food, and a place where you feel part of the family...Go to Brenda's Kitchen."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and holy cow this place is good, no wonder it is packed. It is a little mom and pop place, which you know are the best. I first went to Denny's and ended up walking out (that is for another review), and ended up at Brenda's. The staff were nice and the food was fantastic. It tasted homemade. I had chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, and creamy chicken barley soup. The chicken friend steak was so tender and flavorful, and the gravy on top tasted like real butter, cream, and sausage. The soup was amazing. Chicken in every bite. So creamy and fresh I felt like I wanted to weep tears of joy. The next day we tried a patty melt, macaroni salad, potato salad, mushroom swiss burger, and albondigas soup. It was all extremely delicious. The soup was probably the best and the chicken fried steak a close second."}
{"text":"Brenda and her colleagues were as pleasant as could be.  This is a quaint, neighborhood restaurant with a diner feel, filled with friendly locals, great food and very good coffee.  I had the chorizo scrambled eggs with tortilla and fruit - so tasty!  I almost always sit at the counter when traveling alone and at least three locals engaged me in conversation during my breakfast.  My kinda place!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is kind of hidden away, and GPS puts it in the wrong place. But after my discovery of the right location, it was well worth my search. The customer service was excellent, considering that they had a pretty full house when I arrived. The meal was excellent as well and has me going back for more. Excellent atmosphere and very courteous staff makes it the perfect place to go for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"...i eat here all the time. Its good food. Please stay away....it gets busy and some times I find my self waiting a while for a seat...... So please . Stay away"}
{"text":"I love this place. every time I am in town I stop here. the staff are friendly and they treat you like family. It is a business with small town values in a big city. Love 8t here."}
{"text":"Breakfast time and we wanted to eat out instead of at home. Had read their reviews and looked like a place to try.  When we got there and looked around it was obvious that there was a large regular crowd eating here.  What i liked was the service and their willing to tailor your meal to your liking. Their food is reasonably priced and good. Bacon and eggs are hard to mess up but that is what I like and they did a great job. The place was clean and again the service was excellent.  Will I be back? Yes I will. The only hang up is we always go out on Sunday for breakfast and they are closed on Sundays.  Give them a try if you are hungry and in the area. You will like them."}
{"text":"I could deal with the overcooked bacon. I could deal with the fact it took as long to get my check as it did to order and receive my meal. I CANNOT deal with the potatoes tasting like FISH....    DISGUSTING"}
