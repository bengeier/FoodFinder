{"text":"Not too shabby!   The spring rolls were fantastic and pho was pretty good. Service was friendly, place was clean. A decent experience all around."}
{"text":"Out on another one of my adventures to the middle of no where.  We see this pho place in a plaza full of bridal boutiques.  We thought it was so weird so we dropped in for a bite.  Not sure how long this place has been here but it's pretty well kept despite the ugly colors (my personal opinion :) ).  They have flat screens up so we know they are pretty modern which is nice.  Waitress was nice.  Food was ok.  Wasnt terrible but not quite up to my standards.   Decent meal still.  Overall i would give it 3.5 if yelp let me."}
{"text":"Great value here, less than $10 meals (as it should be for Viet food). I got the com bi, a rice dish with pork chops, steamed egg and shredded pork. It was ok, not the most flavorful shredded pork or nearly enough veggie garnishes! I want my plate surrounded with cucumber and tomatoes!   I won't compare with my mum's cooking, I did enjoy it for the price. Would go back to try something else. It's a pho restaurant, I should probably try it..."}
{"text":"So I ordered from them for the third or fourth time today and they forgot my hoisin and hot sauce   The meat was laden with fat as usual and to be quite honest pho without hoisin and hot sauce just doesn't taste good so I called to complain that they forgot these must have sauces; at first they said they would bring it for us when their driver (who I tipped 25% of bill) went back out for a delivery. They called us back to offer us a $2 discount on our next order.  What next order?  All in all if only slightly above average pho cannot be delivered with what it is served with in every Pho restaurant from Saigon to Toronto, than quite franky it is too unreliable to waste your money on  Add to that the only slightly above average pho to begin with and Miss Pho is going to be hurting for customers  Stay away at all costs"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.75 stars, I would here. Thus, I am rounding up to 4 stars.   I have been dropping by this restaurant for well over a year. I can't believe that I have yet to post a review. I'm fixing this issue immediately!  I used to take the highway from work to my home. I work in Mississauga. It's a pain. Instead, I decided nearly a year ago to take Steeles Avenue home. Soak up the view. Drive without being stressed and under the gun. Oddly, it is faster during rush hour!  Anyway, I have found a number of eateries that caused me to stop for dinner when I backroad it home. Miss Pho is one of them. I love pho. It was a must.   I am a regular customer now. I walked in after work last Friday and was greeted promptly. The woman working there recognized me and asked how I was. She then proceeded to ask me whether I wanted hot or iced tea. Iced?! I had no idea. I went with it. It was refreshing!  I typically order the rare beef and beef ball pho. This visit, I ordered soft rolls with shrimp, pork, and chicken. They were delicious and fresh. The dipping sauce with chopped peanuts hit the spot.   I then order vermicelli with sausage and shrimp paste on a sugar cane. So yummy! I devoured it all. Everything worked well.   There is plenty of parking in this huge parking lot that seems to be aimed towards to-be brides and grooms.   The first time I visited, I said to the woman that the food was delicious. After I had paid on Friday, she thanked me for dropping by and wished me a nice weekend.   I have never had a bad meal here. Customer service is great and key.   (195)"}
