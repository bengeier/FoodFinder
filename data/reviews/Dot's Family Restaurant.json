{"text":"Dot's is a place you wouldn't get a chance to enjoy unless a (trusted) friend or family member implored you to go in rather than drive by. Dot's is, literally, just a dot on the side of the road.

Dot's is also awesome. 

Soup. Bread. Stuffed Cabbage. Regulars. 
Horror flicks on the tv above the bar, complete with detailed and informed reviews by the guy tending said bar.

So. Awesome.

From a time when these sorts of places were a dime a dozen, we get to still enjoy Dot's in a time when these sorts of places are a rarity. A delicious, cozy, kitschy rarity."}
{"text":"The rare place you can get a turkey club with real turkey. Not lunch meet. Very good quality tasty food at a very reasonable price. Local business with homemade American food. Great service."}
{"text":"CLOSED as of April 30, 2018 - the sign out front reads \"Thank You for 57 years\" & the voicemail states their last day of business was the aforementioned date. It's a real shame this place has closed it's doors for good. This was a real gem of a place. Nothing fancy, just great home cooked food. Their \"hunky hand-grenades\" were always my favorite!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but small portions. Wait time was 35 minutes. 
Special note: they do NOT take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Very good homemade food. Ordered mashed potatoes and meatloaf.  Nothing from a box here.  Very good!  Busy place so you know it's good.  Vintage decor."}
{"text":"Dots has been cooking family style home cooked meals for a long time. They havent changed a thing since the Andrew Carnegie days except for their potatoes(which are no longer real). If you want a hardy bowl of soup on a cold winter day in Pittsburgh then look no further than dots."}
