We walked in there on a Monday at 10am and ask if they had any crusants  the lady said yes we have one plane 2 chocolate  and that 
In my mind made me think  like is that leftover from Sunday. 
There's wasn't a lot of fresh bread there either. 
Sunshine going through the front door hitting the deli meats . 
Wow the worst Portuguese  bakery  I've ever seen in a long time .
Dirt windows with old flyers faded  from the sun .
We left without  buying  anything  and wont ever g back ."}
{"text":"I was craving Portuguese custard tarts today.  My boyfriend and I decided to check out this bakery, as we had not visited in a few months.  We've been here a few times and their pastries, custard tarts, custard filled donuts etc have always been exceptional, we also enjoy randomly trying new drinks from their selection. 
They certainly do not disappoint. The custard tarts were a crispy, light pastry shell nestling a sweet creamy egg custard, it was the perfect balance. I thoroughly enjoy their custard, we generally get the custard filled eclairs which are simply divine... it's a chocolate covered pastry with custard, you could never go wrong with that combo. Lol
Their custard tarts are always consistently fresh and delicious and one of our favourite spots in Brampton.
Always a great experience.
This is becoming a Saturday morning must have... Lol. Custard Tarts and a cup of coffee, is the stuff of magical mornings."}
{"text":"The bakery monster strikes again!  This is solely based on the Portuguese tarts and tiramisu.  I can't really comment on the breads or hot foods. However, from what I got the pastries were defs A-OK.

I came 30 minutes to close on a Wednesday and the two things I got were still in pretty good shape.  The cake in the tiramisu is a little dense but the bottom sponge layer of cake is really moist.  This is what made me enjoy it more.  I wasn't too crazy about my first bite but eating more of the bottom layer made it better.  The tarts were pretty friggin good in my opinion.  I mean, I haven't had a ton of Portuguese tarts in my life, but I've had some.  The custard in this was definitely bomb.  Nice flavour. Nice texture.  The pasty wasn't too hard or 'stale' tasting.  It was a pretty darn good tart.  Also, the custard was not overly burnt. 

I knew this place existed but never brought myself to actually explore it until my bf suggested it.  Glad I did though!  There aren't many bakeries that offer these kind of pastries in 'main Brampton'.  I will return =)"}
