{"text":"Stopped in here to eat on a Sunday while shopping in Kensington. Was really hungry and the idea was to get a quick bite to eat before carrying on. Definitely picked the wrong place for that. There were only two people waiting tables and making drinks, for a Sunday Kensington crowd. They were overly busy and very inattentive. Despite the staff knowing we were there we waited for probably 15 minutes before having to go up to the counter and ask for menus. We were never offered water. Then we waited quite a long time for the pizza. I had asked for basil on mine, which oddly wasn't a menu option. I was told they'd be happy to add it, but when my pizza arrived it had one single solitary basil leaf on it. The pizza was served on rough wooden boards which is aesthetically a nice idea, but hygienically, not so much. Mine had chunks of old food stuck to it--pretty gross. We weren't given, nor were there available anywhere that we could see, standard condiments like grated parmesan or chili peppers. The pizza was pretty good, chewy crust and tasty sauce, and my husband's cappuccino was nice, but unfortunately the long wait and slow, inattentive service means I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The closest thing in the city to eating in Italy! Have gone a number of times and each time the food has been fresh and great tasting, would highly recommend their veal sandwich. Also a great assortment of imported products from Italy to take home to create your own masterpiece, my personal favourite is the hot pepper oil which I love adding to all my pasta dishes. 
The staff is also incredibly friendly and accommodating. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered 80$ of Uber eats from this place. It was not even edible. The noodles were so over cooked in a clump. I called the restaurant and they said \"they can't guarantee what comes out of the kitchen.\" Now ordering 50$ of Pizza Hut. Horrible customer service. How about offering to send a pizza in replacement?!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Clasic italian done really well (had an amazing!!! eggplant parm sandwich special) in really nice environment. A great selection of beers including local brews on tap.  Great service as well. Laura is the definition of hospitality!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great place. Simply delicious. 
Also stocked my pantry at home!"}
{"text":"The owner was on the phone when I walked in but she served me right away. Great selection and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Walking in Kensington market today with friends, we were trying to decide what to eat when we stumbled across this place. We had eaten at sister restaurant Pizzeria Via Mercanti across the street before but stopped going after experiencing questionable customer service. 

Apparently Via Mercanti Food Shop has been open since January. It's a cute little food shop/restaurant where you can buy specialty Italian foods like olive oil, balsamic vinegar, bottles of roasted artichokes/mushrooms, and one pot seasoned dry pasta (my friend bought some for camping). 

They also have a large selection of very good paninis and pizzas, as well as ready made foods like meatballs, pasta, and salad. I appreciated that I was able to get spelt bread as a choice of bread with my panini. My veal parmigiana panini had a good amount of fior de latte, tomato sauce (although I would have liked some for dipping), and veal (maybe not quite as much as say California Sandwiches, but I suppose it would make it messier in the panini press). They also sell a bunch of unique sparkling beverages (not your typical San Pellegrino). Italian pastries and gelato are also for sale (although the latter wasn't available at the time of my visit).

If you're looking for authentic Italian specialty grocery items, or for a nice place to have a decent lunch inside or on a patio, try Via Mercanti Food Shop. 3.25 stars.

{"text":"Awesome food selection and fantastic service. My wife and I love the personal size Roman pizzas and enjoy sitting on the patio while we enjoy the fantastic pizzas, appetizers and a bottle of wine. We also enjoy the fact that we can buy some of their amazing pizza dough and other products to take home, too!  Laura and Claudia provided us with excellent service!  We can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"The wait staff here was great - they made me feel like they were my extended Italian family. The place was packed on one floor, but they managed to fit us elsewhere in between reservations out of their dedication to our dining. The atmosphere really helped to alleviate some of the stress in my life. Furthermore, the food was extraordinary - in particular, the goat cheese was to die for. In conclusion, you'd be \"Sicily\" not to come here."}
{"text":"So I stopped by for a quick bite while shopping in Kensington.

Ordered the daily pasta special - some pasta al forno with sausage dish. The pasta was OK. The pasta was cooked just right but it was bland and tasteless. But here's the kicker - there was one little piece of sausage. ONE.

The redeeming quality was the young waitress (her family owns the place) was rather friendly.

Funny though, I just looked at the other reviews of this place to see what others have said and why is it that all the reviewers that give it five stars and rave about this place with the most extremely positive adjectives like \"excellent\", or \"amazing\", or \"awesome\", or \"fantastic\", or \"extraordinary\" are all reviewers with only one or at most a handful of \"reviews\" and none of them have a legit picture in their profile??"}
{"text":"I made an order of 64$ on Uber Eats from this place. When it arrived, 2 whole pizzas were missing. The Uber driver was open to go back if they re ordered the delivery from Via Mercanti. I called them on the phone and they didn't know how to do it so I ended up with no pizza, ordering to another place, having 64$ charged to my account with the Mercanti guy saying \"Is not our problem\" and me telling him \"It is...because I am not going to buy a pizza from your place again\".

Thanks Via Mercanti."}
