{"text":"Chili chicken was freaking awesome and the red tamarind sauce that came with it made the meal. Girlfriends gyrocame with  with plenty of lamb"}
{"text":"Kabob Korner is definitely my favorite restaurant.  I've been coming here for over a year.  The staff is very friendly and the food is always delicious and inexpensive!  I will never get tired of this place!  Chicken Tikka is my favorite, but everything is good!"}
{"text":"In Vegas you have to try the food. Very delicious and fresh meat. Kebabs are the best."}
{"text":"Food is veryyyy good. Customer service is not so good. But it's worth if for the food!"}
{"text":"Good food good price plus its halal which is hard to find also they are greedy half chicken for 10 bucks hard to find thank god for the good food thnx kobab korner"}
{"text":"Some of the best Kebabs I've had outside of the Middle East.  A cool new neighborhood, funky restaurant with lots of eclectic items, no tap water (but bottles were pretty cheap), and the owners were just chilling out and chatting with everyone, a couple of doctors and a policeman, and some great food.  A chicken kebab plate comes with salad and some delicious rice."}
{"text":"This place is very good! I was there last September and I had the Kabobs. The naan bread is great. I will be in LV again  in September and look forward to getting my lunch at KK and getting right over to the sports book at the Horseshoe. Now that's a perfect day!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner at 7pm. A menu was provided to us at 7:15 and a lady came to take order at 7:25. None of the items we wanted to have were available. We were tired after a long day of travel and decided to take from items that were available.   Went to wash hands. There was no soap and no toilet paper in the restroom. The food was served without utensils. The food was okay but not adequate for the price. After we had finished dinner, we were given the check with wrong pricing. Gratuity was added on the bill for four.   In summary, the experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"i eat here very frequently  i don't know why  it's probably because it's nearby it's ok i like that they deliver and have a wide variety of  canned soda but they don't have shish kabobs they only have  kabobs there's a difference but i do like the gyros."}
{"text":"Got the chili chicken. It was pretty spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has gone down A Lot! The prices are going up (now, buffet to go is almost $15..used to be $13. There is no gyros in the buffet, last time no chicken Tikka in buffet, time before no beef, one time fly kept going in salad..seriously, keep your selection a buffet...disappointed..not worth going to anymore."}
{"text":"I'm from los Angeles but Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure I drop by. The food here is incredible. It's the best Indian Pakistan halal food I have ever had anywhere ....."}
{"text":"Not only did they raise the prices since I've last been year, they raised the heat. The food tastes like it came straight from the microwave, including the battle-ready pita they served, with edges so hard it cut my lips.   I ordered the chicken special, but got two long pieces of avian turd. Sorry if I'm being culturally insensitive, but the food was just not visually appetizing, nor was it gastronomically appealing.  The tables were greasy, like Exxon Valdez: the Sequel happened. However, the staff were very friendly, and even offered me a free drink! Delicious battery acid dissolving soda, yum!"}
{"text":"Best halal food in Vegas ! It's one place me and my husband make a point of eating at every time we visit. Service is amazing too. A must try for all."}
{"text":"The KK is more than OK...it's fantastic!! They have a large menu and all the dishes ever tried have been delicious! Strongly recommend the Chili Chicken and Lamb Sharwma.  Kabob Korner is now my new go to Pakistani Food Stop!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place at least a 4 star rating, but unfortunately the food is just not that good, it was rather disappointing.   I've been here before and it was quite good. But this time I don't know what happened.  My boyfriend, roommate, and I ordered a super gyro, fried chicken with fries, hummus, cheese cake, and Greek salad.   The sauce that came with the gyro had almost no taste at all, and the texture was like water. The meat was extremely salty, it seems like its covering up some flavor that I'm not able to identify. Fried chicken is also too salty, where we can't even finish the 2nd piece. Greek salad was the only dish that I would've gave a 3.5 star. The hummus was awful. It smelled like neem oil, and tasted like cardboard. And last thing we touched was the cheese cake. I don't know if anyone had ever ordered cheese cake from this place, but from the look of it, I think we are the first and maybe the last to order that. It was chalky and the top layer was almost hard.  I really liked this place. But I think it has been slacking and needs more of that TLC. I live just around the corner from Fremont street and I want the cafes and restaurants around the area to be great. So I hope the owner would see this review and take this as a constructive criticism to better its food to a 5 star quality!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, while the odor in the interior of the restaurant is unbearable; and to make things worse the food is terrible and definitely not fresh;  The lamb Kebob taste like anything but lamb; while the French fries were soggy and pita bread dry;  I recommend going to another halal serving joint."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Afghan food in the area! Highly recommend their Knockout Burger - full of flavor and quality. Service is super friendly too and they give honest recommendations on their own menu. Visited this place multiple times in the same trip to Vegas. And you will too."}
{"text":"Non descript location at the end of Fremont Street just before the El Cortez Casino.  The building is not much to look at, and the inside is worn, but everything was clean.  The owners are super friendly and speak about four or five languages including Punjabi, Urdu, Malay, and Arabic.    The lamb GYRO I had was excellent.  About 6 bucks and worth every cent.  They will spice it up the way you want--hot or mild, you choose.  Fresh onions, tomato, lettuce.  Like they used to say at McD's--hot side was hot, cool side was cool.  Tasty!  Very good place for a light dinner or snack.  No beer or wine, but hey, you're on Fremont street so alcohol is a stones throw away.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Woww..big disappointment!! Good things: veg pakora and lamb kabab. Not good things:  Didn't even serve water. Chicken curry was tasteless  Very limited options  Rice is not good and no biryani. No naans but just pita bread Yelp timing says, opens at 11 am but it's actually 11:30  We couldn't complete what we had in our plates. Wouldn't recommend this if you want to energize ur taste buds."}
{"text":"Great food (I tried cheese burger and chicken wings) and extraordinary customer service.  A must if you are in Vegas and hungry."}
{"text":"Visited this place during 8/1/15 - 8/2/15   I just hope the owner reads this and learn a lesson or two.   Here are some negative points.   - Bad BAD customer service  - Quality is not maintianed - Drinks are supposedly self service  - No plates offered - No Sauce offered - No Utensils offered and SO much more!   LEARN THIS !  - Welcome your guests with a freaking SMILE! - Before the food arrives - Serve plates and utensils - Keep smiling if customer is re ordering even if its near closing hours. YOU ARE SUPPOSE to serve them until you close ! OTHERWISE PUT A NOTICE.  - wash your dishes properly! - IF A CUSTOMER WANTS TO SPLIT THE PAYMENT BETWEEN CC and CASH, ACCEPT IT! we are in 2015 not 1915 !   This is going to be a LONG review to please bare with me if you care or else dont!  Here's a little background - I visited this place with my friends back in April. As we were exhausted, I didn't really pay attention to the details. Food was great (especially BEHARI Kabab) loved it.   Now to the recent experience.   Went to Vegas from LA with my buddies. The entire time I kept bragging about this place to my friends and how this place has most amazing behari kababs ever.   Yelp states that they close at 11 Pm. - I called them at 10:05 and spoke to a nice gentleman who said yes we are open till 11 pm. I repeatedly asked him if they could serve us Behari kebabs in specific. He obliged and said YES (REPEATEDLY). We left our hotel and while on the way, I called again just to make sure. He then again said YES (REPEATEDLY). I was well satisfied and was looking forward to it.   10:30 - We got seated.  The host gave us 4 Menus and said \"we can only serve chicken biryani, chicken karahi, and any of the burgers\"  My reply: I just spoke to someone and asked specifically about the behari kababs.  Host: NO My reply: I called twice! Host: Let me check *he goes back in the kitchen and checks for god knows what* Host: Ok yes, if you had ordered us then we coould have made it but sorry we cant now. My reply: What are you talking about ? I just spoke to him 10 mins ago How can he not make it now?  Host: Yea he cant.  I was so frustrated at his blunt  and not to courteous responses. I was about to stand up and leave.   Somehow he put aside his ego and said \"ok we will serve you 1 plate of behari kabab'  1 PLATE? LIKE I dont get it. but anyhow. I said ok and we ordered rest of the food from that 'restricted menu'   ONLY reason this place gets a star from me is because of their taste. YES it tastes GOOD! No doubt about it. It is overpriced by a huge margin but arent they all?   Next day - I decided to give them another try. This time, we went for Lunch. around 3 Pm.   This experience was going to be rather worse, I would have not imagined it.   I called in advance again and asked specifically about the behari kabab. Host \"yes its available\" Me \"Can I place an order ? I'll be there in 15 mins\" Host: \"yes absolutely\" I ordered my food and got there in 20 mins.   Host \"Yes your order is being made and should be out very soon\" Me \"Thank YOU!\" I was quite excited !  My order arrived 45 minutes AFTER I was seated. So 45 minutes plus the 30 mins advance notice I gave them. ARE YOU SERIOUS? They seriously tested our patience. FOOD WAS HORRIBLE - OVERCOOKED.   Most terrible experience EVER!   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place was at Freemont St in downtown, now they moved here.   Same great taste. Try Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Super cheap food for Vegas, I went with a vegan friend who had a couple options here. I wasn't sure if they would because of how small the spot was. Food came up quick and decent. The hummus was nothing to speak of,  a bit bland, but I can't complain too much because the rest of the food was moderate. It is what it is and I wasn't expecting anything different..."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty restaurant about 1:30pm.  Had read previous reviews so I was prepared for a long wait. Ordered two plates, waited about 35 minutes.  It definitely has a \"hole in the wall\" look to it, but the food is worth the wait! I'm glad I trusted the other reviewers!  I hope it's still around next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here with family for lunch. Firstly, service was terrible and so was the ambiance and seating. It took very long for simple meals to come. The waitress would keep coming and tell us  5 minutes and the food still wouldn't come for over 15 mins. In total, we had been waiting for over an hour for a couple cheese burgers. When you're a family with a hungry baby and senior citizens, you NEED food to come out. In the end, the food was not very good. Nobody was happy with their dishes and we all left unhappy as we wasted about two hours at the restaurant. The only thing we liked was the Philly cheese steak.All in all, it was a bad experience. On a separate note, we were not welcomed into the restaurant, nor were we offered any drinks or menus until later. It is also probably important to note that we are usually not picky and critical about these things.   We later found out that there were only TWO people working in the entire restaurant, including the chef. Which is why everything was so slow. But why would a restaurant only have two employees???"}
{"text":"This was my favourite eat out place in downtown Las Vegas.. they closed down some time back was pretty sad.. but they opened in this new location.. hurraaay .. very spacious, extra seating in the patio idea is awesome..spacious and romantic...they have retained the old favourites + added a lot more in the menu.. Way to go, delicious food and with great customer service.."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Worst dining experience ever. our food took an hour to come out after we had ordered, and that too, not all of it at once. we ordered 6 naan to eat our food with (we were 7 people) and no naan came out until 10 mins later. the waitress brought out ONE naan and 15 mins later brought out ONE more. by this time all our food was cold and nobody was able to eat anything. and to top it all off, right at the end she let us know that one of the dishes we had ordered and were waiting for was not available. if she had told us at the beginning we might have been able to order something else. not to mention they do not give you any complimentary water, just $4 water bottles which makes no sense at all. we ended up leaving without finishing our food. I do not recommend this place solely due to their horrible service."}
{"text":"Been here the past two Fridays and I'm a fan now.  My first time, I ordered the chicken tikka, which I found VERY flavorful and delicious!  It came with rice, pita bread and a small salad.  The cucumber dressing and chili sauce is very good as well.  Today, i wanted to try something different so I ordered the chili chicken.  This dish is gooooood!  If you like spicy, then you'll love this.  It was a bit spicier than I'm used to, but the pita bread helped with that. LOL!  It's a big portion too, so I had to ask for a to-go box for my leftovers.   What I liked is that the chicken was not dry like I've had at other kabob or halal places.  It's very flavorful and juicy.   If you plan on eating there, call ahead.  It can take about 15 minutes for your order.  There's not a lot of seating, either."}
{"text":"We're the only ones in the resturant, and the service was bad.   I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, and I got chicken tikka.  They have the worst service ever."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, this place is definitely worth the visit. Their food is amazingly delicious and satisfying. I had their scrumptious onion rings during my last visit, It was so delicious and magical that I could hardly contain myself. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious chicken, great pita, and fair portions. They do take about 30 minutes, so call ahead, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Super Gyro Pita is insanely delicious. Definitely the best gyro I have had in Vegas. The lamb is so tender and well seasoned. Everything down to the onions is perfect. Fresh toppings and they don't skimp on the feta or tzatziki. The hummus was also very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Horrible service. Server stood there.  Never picked up empty plates or refilled drinks. Had to wait and ask for the check."}
{"text":"Was in town for a CTIA convention so tried this place and i have to say the food quality and quantity was great and great service too. Highly recommend you stop by if your visiting las vegas and looking for a great meal!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I read good reviews and sounded like what I was in the mood for. I was greeted immediately upon walking in and the gentleman, who turned out to be the owner, was super nice and very helpful in helping me decide what to have. I knew I wanted to try the beef Tikka and he told me if I wanted a little variety I could have anything in combination with each other. At his suggestion I went with the chicken boti  kabob. That really was an excellent suggestion as both were amazing and incredibly flavorful. I'm glad I was the last one there because I believe I may have been making faint grunting noises as I demolished the whole plate along with the hummus he made fresh for me just because I mentioned that I liked it during our conversation. I'll be back on the regular just to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Since this restaurant first opened, it has been a favorite around our house. The owner put a lot of effort into the food and was always in a funny mood.  Today (March 14, 2012), before leaving with an order, I learned that there is a new owner but am unsure if he was the surly man behind the counter. when we open the food at home, the falafel was burn't beyond edibility or recognition and the hummus tasted like chalky paste. Nothing on the plate was edible. It's so hard to count on good, affordable food in Las Vegas and this is the latest fatality in the downtown food scene. R.I.P."}
{"text":"We were the only customers here on a Friday night. It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks and 30 minutes to get our meal.  The waitress never checked in on us during our wait.  When we finally got our drinks the fine glasses were taken away and we were given plastic cafeteria style cups.  When I inquired why I was told they were for decoration only.  Although the service was poor the food was Delicious. Food this good should be paired with exceptional service.  To top it off they add an automatic 15% tip to all dine in orders. You mean I MUST pay for poor service? I would consider going back for the delicious food, but for take out only."}
{"text":"The guy cheated us by adding more money on tve bill than it costs...and he said he ran out of burgers but the regular customers came in and orderee a burger and he made it for them..wouldn't go back the rest of the food wasnt that great"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.... In downtown las vegas.....food is tasty....but it takes a long time ..... so order ahead...When you reach food will be ready....famous for gyros.....and spicy chicken entrees.......parking is another pain.....Overall a good place to eat....."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, I ordered food over the phone and when I got there they didn't have my order, so i reorder again for my whole family, waited for more than an hour, they missed my order again, they even didn't apologize, I was 10 years customer and I am not going there for sure. If you have time to waste and leave hungry after an hour then go to this place."}
{"text":"closed down - hope they open close by - granted the guy behind the counter was awful but the food was tasty-not as good as precious owners (even tho same guy cooking) but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my latest visit to Kabob Korner.  I have been to the downtown location many times but this was my first time eating there since they moved to the new location.  I had the Chicken Gyro - no onions and my friend had the regular Gyro - no onions.  Both arrived with onions and hers had small black plastic in the food.  Not sure how she had plastic in her dish but that's definitely what it was. (Maybe a plastic bowl chipped?)  She is a pretty good sport so she sent it back for another gyro and the next one was plastic free.  The service was not great and the pricing has definitely increased since the last time I was there.  $12 for a chicken gyro w/fries and a can of soda is just way too much.  (That was before the tip)"}
{"text":"Came in for a $5 gyro and ended up with an almost $8 super gyro for one reason or another: out of beef but I wanted feta.... The meat and pita were both hot and the lettuce and tomatoes cold so that was good. Tzatziki,  onions and feta were a treasure hunt to find. The lamb was seasoned well but had too many fatty pieces in it for my taste."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. Little bit of a wait but well worth it because food is made fresh. Customer service is very friendly. 15% gratuity included on all dine in. Had the chicken boti shish kabob and it was very tasty. Would come back again :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas again. Wanted some Mediterranean food. Found this place on yelp. Reviews were mixed. I've learned to make my own judgement. This place as great service and awesome food. Had their buffet items were limited but the flavor was huge. Chicken tiki was delicious. Lamb was absolutely the best. I've had Mediterranean but this was the best. If you are traveling to Vegas it's a great place to come and have some lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Food is Ok but service is very bad.. They do not even give water glass to customer and we have to buy it. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"great food i love this place i recommend the chicken kabab    the service its great they make you feel like you are home everything i tried was good and the place its nice and clean ."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS! We ordered a behari kabob roll, goat karahi, and boneless chilli chicken with rice and salad and it was all very tasty! The host Arham was polite, kind,  prompt, and accommodating. As soon as we entered the restaurant, immediately he was at our service, and for a better atmosphere he directed us to sit outside. The restaurant is clean and has a nice romantic touch to it. Several times Arham would check in with us and refill our glasses. I also requested Arham to change the music and he listened and took immediate action. When the food arrived, we were so overwhelmed and we thought we wouldn't be able to finish it, but we finished every single bite. The naans were mouth watering and the chilli chicken was heavenly and the behari kabob wrap was amazing! Overall, it was a great and a wonderful experience. Arham and his team were WONDERFUL!! WE WILL COME AGAIN!!! :))))"}
{"text":"A friend took me here and at first I was questioning whether or not to walk into the restaurant.  It's located on a corner of a building on Fremont and the restaurant looks old and greasy. Another thing that had me questioning whether or not to stay was the menu. I've never had Pakistan food before so I didn't know what I should order. I ended up sharing the tuna salad and the beef kabob. The food was different from anything I've ate before and it was actually pretty delicious.  It's not one of my favorites, so I don't know if I'd come back, but it's definitely worth a try! The best thing here is their pita bread so don't forget to get something with pita bread!"}
{"text":"This is the best effin gyro I had.....super gyro all day!!!! And the owner is cool as f@$&"}
{"text":"Good food, good portions for the price. Very reasonable. Clean atmosphere. Very quiet when I came in. Customer service was very friendly"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Service was even better. Portions are very big. Reasonable prices. Easy to find parking. Great host. Must visit when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"First off I love Mediterranean food and this place was no disappointment. The food was excellent & we tried several different things."}
{"text":"I'd walked by this nondescript building many times on my way down Fremont to the Cortez.  After reading some yelp reviews, I decided to stop in.  The Super Gyro (only $5.99!) was just fabulous, and the baklava I fired down for dessert was almost as good.  The food was so good, I came back the following night as well!  Give the Kabob Korner a try if you're bumbling down Fremont...it's light years better than any other fast food one can get downtown!"}
{"text":"Great place downtown for some awesome drunk food.  Being next door to the Griffin makes it very convenient.  I had the Gyro and fries and was very pleased.  The service was amazing too.  I was a little intoxicated from being at The Griffin and forgot my bag of stuff I bought at a shop downtown there.  They tracked me down and gave it back to me.  It wasn't crowded either out there.  This will be a must every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I realy enjoyed the eating pakistan food , this pakistans foods was way better the others pakistans restaurants food in vegas , ? will vizit again when ? come to vegas ."}
{"text":"Kabob Korner tradition once in every week! My philly and fries! Reasonable price:-) fresh and marinated with a little bit spicy!"}
{"text":"here food is really good. and customar service really nice.  i like to go there so many times."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! They have completely revamped their buffet and they have new options to choose from, including lamb. The food looked good and tasted even better. The  staff was very polite and accommodating. The owner himself came out and asked how everything was. I like what they have done with the place and me and my friends will definitely be back. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants some good Mediterranean food. A+++"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3 stars for their lack of customer service, but the food was really good so I added another star. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas. The only downside to this place is that it's in downtown- so you'll have to look for parking on the street. We ordered the lamb shwarma plate & sandwich. The portions were huge and the lamb was very tasty. The prices were great as well!   I just wish the server would say 'thank you' and learn to smile and be more friendly. Instead, he just looked annoyed that we were there. Also, the photos that are on this yelp page are outdated and not true. They have changed ownership and some of those dishes are no longer available."}
{"text":"The service is awful but besides that the owner has a very smart mouth on him and is very rude. If you show any concern he seems to want to punish you and say your order wi take 1 hour and make u wait. He is very inconsiderate and literally a smart mouth. He charges extra on the bill so make sure you check your biil. Food is nothing to brag about. And with his attitude not worth it all."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we have been here.  The Super Gyro is the bomb!  Not your run of the mill frozen pressed meat.  This has some substance.  They grill the meat with onion, peppers, and tomato.  Served on a grilled pita with lettuce and fantastic feta.  Priced right.  Don't let the neighborhood throw you off.  Just east of Fremont St. Experience.  I mean this is one good gyro!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Terrible! And the worker watches you eat the while time. Just standing around watching you eat is not ideal if you ask me."}
{"text":"Yelp really steered me right with this one. Amazing food and service. Super nice guy working the front recommended the number 2, which was a really good chicken plate with big chunks of roasted white meat with the perfect blend of spice and seasoning, flavorful yellow rice, and fresh cooked flat bread of the gods. Took awhile to wait for it, maybe 20 mins, but they were really busy on a Friday night. It also tasted like it was worth the time waited. Can't complain. Perfect dinner for a fun night out on Fremont St, which was just a little less crowded than the strip."}
{"text":"went there yesterday, i have never reviewed a restaurant but this one is so bad that i feel that i have to. i went here with my family and it was the worst excuse for middle eastern and pakistani food that i have ever seen. the owner is extremely rude, looks like he doesnt want to be there and isnt responsive to half the things that you say to him. we went around 4pm and there was not a single person in the shop other than the owner, then we sat down at the wobbly, sticky, and dirty tables and werent even offered menus or anything, we had to go up and get them from the counter. this would be fine if there was a large sign that had a list of all the foods they had to offer and what not (like at taco bell or something). i ordered the shrimp basket, it said that i would get 25 but i barely got 20 (i can forgive that) but none of the shrimp had been deveined, when i asked the owner if they forgot he said that they ordered the shrimp breaded and dumped them in the fryer. i couldnt eat them so they all went to waste and even when the owner saw that he did not apologize for it. then i ordered the falafel wrap, that was another thing that had been dumped in the fryer and put into a piece of bread. the whole thing was soggy and i was barely able to eat that. the rest of my family ordered kabob plates and the kabobs were over cooked, and the tiny portion of rice that cam with it was drenched in oil, probably so they would only have to cook rice once every 3 days. overall, dirty restaurant, soggy overcooked food, rude owner. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. probably good food if you are drunk or something. it might have been a good restaurant in the past, but not anymore."}
{"text":"One of my favorites on Fremont.  High quality meat, friendly service and a great, diverse menu (from middle eastern to american fair).  Prices are fantastic!  The place on Fremont East for cheap, good eats. $3.99 for a double cheese burger that I would put up to ANY burger on Fremont.   Lacking one star because if they're busy, it can take a long time to get your food.  I'd recommend calling in, or planning on a sit down dinner.   Also, lighting and atmosphere can be improved upon especially if you're interested in a sit down meal.  Thank you Kabob Korner!  You make my life better and easier!"}
{"text":"Great little place. The food is good, but the staff is even BETTER. If you're hanging downtown and want some good real food, definitely check this place out! The chicken kabobs were bomb and the falafel was really good too! It's really worth it just to get such exceptional service from great people!"}
{"text":"Such a bummer. I remember ordering samosas from here by way of Downtown Cocktail Room and they were delicious. They were just as delicious tonight, however they were frozen in the middle! Not appetizing. Gordon Ramsey would be livid! Not sure if I'd come back here knowing that they're not fresh unless I had quite a few cocktails first from around the corner"}
{"text":"I LOVE Kabob Korner!  Here is why...  YAYs... -BEST gyros in LV!!! ...the soft pita, the flavorful meat, the awesomely tasting yogurt sauce... is TO DIE FOR!  ***Ask for the SUPER GYRO!*** -Try the Chicken wings... it's always a dilemma between Gyro vs. Chicken wings... it helps to dine with a companion.  Thanks Andy T., for sharing your chicken wings with me! -Hawaiian Sun sodas and Kerns Nectar juices... are awesome!  -WIDE screen TV... always on the Food Network. -GREAT service!!!  Very affordable!!!  ...I always have a fun experience here!  NAYs... -Not the cleanest, but it's downtown LV so it's as clean as it can get! :)  SERVICE: ***** [The guys get 3Fs... Fast, Funny, & Friendly!] AMBIANCE: **** [small place, not the cleanest tables, but the taste of the food is totally worth it!]    FOOD:  ***** [BEST gyros in LV!  No bias, no joke.  Chicken wings are BOMB!] PRICE:  [$5-10]  OVERALL: ***** [5-stars, no doubt! ...and repeat business by me!]  Oh... & Thanks for the one time you served us... even though you already closed your doors!    Awesome. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Food quality:  Our food was freshly cooked and hot.  Good flavor, too.  It had the most meat I've ever had on a gyro (though it could have used a bit more sauce).  The gyro bread was toasted, too.  I liked that.  - Service:  The owner (presumably) paid lots of attention to our order and to us.  Nice guy, too.    Cons: - Not a great place for decor, but then, that wasn't why we went there.  - My son asked for a plain cheeseburger, but got lots of other stuff on it."}
{"text":"Amazing food especially the chicken and beef kabobs and chili chicken. went to this restaurant 3 days in a row while my stay in Vegas. The customer service is outstanding as well. Would highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Food is not consistent and prices go up and down based on the cashiers which are probably pocketing the difference"}
{"text":"Delish! What a wonderful escape from the strip. I had a falafel pita and it was so good! Crispy outside, hot soft inside. The hummus wasn't as flavorful as I'm used to, but everything else was perfect. Small location, and the owner or manager was super friendly. Decor was nice too, I felt like they really tried to make it cozy but still casual. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"First off... I really wanted to like Kabob corner.  Based on the reviews I believed that I would.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't the case.  I ordered the super gyro and a side of falafel balls.  Pros: The meat is Halal (if that is a selling point for you) cut thick and is decently tasty.    Cons: The meat didn't have that awesome crispy edge that I look for with gyro meat. The yogurt sauce consistency was really thin and gooey.  Not very appetizing.  The flavor was unremarkable. I had very little tomato and lettuce and absolutely no onion to speak of either. Falafel,  Ehh....  flavor wasn't too bad, but they were served with the same sauce and were \"doughy\"  Finally, would I take a trip downtown just to go here? No.  If I was in the neighborhood would I stop by? No.  Too many better options for gyro (Kyklos) and falafel (Parsley).  And there are tons of other options downtown.  Better options can be found right on the same block."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was in Vegas for the weekend and I came here and went the next day! I loved the chili chicken and the shrimp kabob. I found that there is one kabob korner in LA so i'm excited to check it out! I'm thinking about going to Vegas again just so that I can go here. The EMPLOYEES are nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Almost a true experience of the middle east. Great food and proper non Americanized atmosphere.  Try the chicken boti kabob #2  Not a fast food joint. They cook the food when you order so expect to wait 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"under a new management.  Food quality and quantity went down. got pricey. No one to clean the sticky tables. so unhygienic  taste: No Good. wait time: 1hour  guys at the counter are staring and have no respect for the customers. better to find a new place."}
{"text":"The $7 Super Gyro pita is legit- delicious tzatziki sauce, crumbles of feta, and an ample portion of gyro meat all packed on a thick pita bread. Bit of miscommunication when ordering and fries were added on to my order, despite repeatedly saying I didn't want them.   Service is prompt, restaurant interior is old-school, docking a star for the menu- instead of scribbling over your line items in marker when you change prices. If you can afford the rent on Fremont Street, you can afford a new menu board every decade."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken gyro, was pretty tasty.  Asked for a sample of lamb and was given a nice portion to taste for free, the lamb is delicious.   Prices are affordable and location is near my work, will come back."}
{"text":"No. I can NEVER avoid a new Kabob place. Not ever. Frankly, I think I would rather eat a good gyro more than any other meat related sandwich, dish, or anything. I am not Greek. I am not of any mediterranean decent, but I have the Gyro fever and there is no stopping me.   So naturally I had to stop in when I was in Fremont to get a load of the Kabob Korner and their Super Gyro of course.   It was a Gyro which is good in my book. It was super if you use the word super kind of sarcastically. Overall it was OK. Really, I am looking for that yogurt sauce and lamb/beef combo to knock my socks off but this super gyro was pretty super normal.   I wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Especially for the area it is really convenient to have the best food in the world so close to old town Vegas. Next time I try it I will update this review- I hope my mind will change or I will find that gem that they cook like none other. For now I say it is worth it if you have the time, the budget and the tase for a Gyro that you just can't kick."}
{"text":"Service and food were both great! I would definitely return here. Down to earth and the food seemed authentic."}
{"text":"I love the chicken tikka, while my husband loves the gyro.  The owner is really nice.  The place is small and can get kind of crowded at peak hours, but most of those people are doing take-out, it seems.  I've never had to wait very long."}
{"text":"The same guy that takes your order, cooks your order, plates your order, then serves your order. Palestinian home cooking at its best! So what? You have to wait...you never rushed your gramma for some cookin' from the heart."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer here since they had their little shop in downtown. Stuck with them even when they switched to a finer location. Stuck with them even when they raised their prices because the food and service was always consistent. However I went in today and was thoroughly disappointed. Not in the food but with the fact that they don't serve water with your meal. I don't get it.... Is this a new trend? If I go into a restaurant and spend 40-60$ the least I can get is a cup of nice refreshing water with my meal but instead i have to continuously buy water bottles which are priced at 2$ a pop. I'd be more understanding if it was a fast food chain and its but your own water but the fact that this location should be more \"upscale\" would incline me to believe that I get a ice cold cup of water with my meal. The only reason I give it two stars is because their chili chicken is alway consistent and great tasting. However as far as the hostess well she kind of just sits there. There's no \"hello\" or \"welcome\"."}
{"text":"Good customer service, poor atmosphere, food OK but very overpriced for what you get. I paid $22 with tip for a plate of Masala Chicken and rice with water. Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm used to the British/Aussie spelling of Kebab so i'm going to refer to this place as Kebab Korner.  Wow if i do end up going downtown more often it's likely because of Kebab Corner.   Found this little spot via a recommendation from Anthony M. Totally forgot about the Super Gyro so the cashier recommended the number 2 entree.   Chicken Boti Kebab (Kabob)  I didnt like the salad at all. All it did was take up space for extra rice or another piece of chicken or a place to put the two sauces. Sure it did add a little bit of color but it was wasted space for the food.  The rice was quite superb. Very fragrant and spiced perfectly, every bite was a melody of flavors you can lose yourself in.   The Chicken was just perfect, seasoned with just the right amount of spices, cooked to the point where there's a nice char flavor but still tender and juicy in the middle. Pair the chicken with the red sweet/spicy sauce made from dates and chilis and WOW.  The pita bread was above and beyond as well, soft and fluffy to the touch, chewy and flavorful to the bite.  Fell in love with the entree, next time going to have an affair with the Pitas."}
{"text":"Parking is a little tough because it's right next to Fremont St. but the food is awesome and so is the staff. I couldn't believe what I got for the money. I most definitely will be back and I looking forward to trying different items on the menu"}
{"text":"Restaurant name and exterior signage implies that they serve Mediterranean food and are located on a corner. Neither of these things are actually true. During lunch they offer a buffet, but during dinner hours, the main menu has a handful of Mediterranean dishes (falafel app, shawarma plates and pitas) but is mostly Indian dishes?  It was a challenge to order a basic Greek salad with protein, because there was a language barrier and the cashier was unfamiliar with the menu. Every question I asked, he would take to the kitchen staff for an answer, then come back still unable to answer my question.  My simple order for a Greek salad ($9 on menu, no description, apparently w/o protein?) plus lamb was rang up as a shawarma plate ($14) and all sides were substituted for the salad. No dressing, flatware, napkins, or pita were included with my takeout order. Tasted just fine but definitely overpriced.  This spot should consider a name change to reflect that the namesake kabobs and Mediterranean cuisine do not describe the  majority of the menu offerings.  NOTE: menu states all dine in orders are charged 15% service fee. Maybe if staff were trained, you wouldn't have to force customers to tip."}
{"text":"Kabob Korner is definitely not fine dining but for what it is, it's awesome.     We were downtown after visiting the Mob Museum and consulted Yelp for help with lunch and found Kabob Korner.  The place is pretty small and not anything fancy but the food was terrific.    I had the beef kabob and my husband had the Super Gyro.    Mine was really good, his was fantastic!     Mine came with a couple sauces that were very tasty - not sure what they are but they are really good.     Only other place I've had anything similar is at the Afghan Kebob House in NYC so it must be a \"kabob thing\".  My kabob came with rice so I didn't get fries but they looked really tasty with some kind of spices on top.     Next visit I'll go for the Super Gyro and a side of fries as I'm sure we'll be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"When it's bad, it's bad.  When it's good, it's . . . decent.  Kabob Korner is a little hole in the wall in the East Fremont Entertainment District downtown that serves up some great post-bar Middle Eastern food (gyros, kabobs, hummus, etc).  If it's late night and you're crawling out of your 3rd bar of the evening, there is no better food for you downtown.  Tasty, seasoned, and salty.  You will talk about how it's the best gyro you've ever had (i.e. the tzatsiki sauce is feta-based and hyper-salty).  But if you wander in Kabob Korner sober, during the light of day, you'll leave thinking \"Huh, that was a meal, alright.\" (not really bad or good, just decent).  So let's break down the experience by meal: - Gyro -- meat is bland strips of overcooked lamb, topped with fresh lettuce and a tzatsiki sauce that isn't tzatsiki sauce (not dill-seasoned yogurt, but a feta-puree).  In the light of day, it's a rich sauce that will dominate the entire gyro with a salty flavor.  After the bar, that amount of salt will convince you it's the greatest gyro on the planet. - Hummus -- bland, but well-blended.  You're pretty much eating this for an excuse to have another pita wedge.  After the bar, oh man, that toasted pita is delicious - Kabob -- probably your best choice.  They actually season the meat and sometimes cook the chicken so it remains tender.    Bottom line: keep Kabob Korner as a post-bar to-do and you'll be happy.  Visit in the light of day and you'll wonder why you eat there."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Very authentic...nice spot to eat and enjoy a fast meal while on the go."}
{"text":"This place is shady as shit, don't go here. The food was alright, I had the goat biryani which was ok except that the menu price didn't match what I got billed for. Apparently somewhere in the menu, it also mentions the fact that there is automatic gratuity which is always lame and shady. If you order water, you get a bottle of water from the grocery store which they charge $2 for. Finally, they only have one young woman working at the front and one person in the back so obviously it was slow service. They won't be in business for much longer, don't help them in the meantime."}
{"text":"We were walking around and saw this place, the place is kind of a hole in the wall with reasonable prices.  Food was excellent but service was atrocious that day, I'd go again though since food was so tasty :)"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service!!! We had the beef tikka kabob and beef nihari. Very flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner, as it seemed like an interesting place near to the Fremont St Experience. It's counter service, very fast food style. I had the chicken boti cabob plate, which was tasty. The baklava was refrigerated and bland. I would stop by here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tikka special since i used to like it from their pervious location and this time serving came in a weird way chicken tikkas were in a separate dish rice and salad in a  separate square bowl. Its so very awkward and uncomfortable. They should have kept all in one big plate. Hope they ll realize soon since its a new setup. Rice that came with it wasn't fresh at all it was microwaved from a yesterday or a day before. Servers are so so. Knockout burger was $8 with just a burger in plate no fries or any sort of side to go with that. Although i don't expect a lot from Desi Restaurants but it felt a little less."}
{"text":"Beef Super Gyros was good but, didn't taste like typical gyros meat ,the texture was more mushy like spam than the more compressed strips of meat I'm use to in a gyros pita. The people inside were friendly"}
{"text":"The best gyros or kabobs that I've had in town are here.  They also make amazing hot dogs and burgers too.  So many random different things on the item and ALL of them are good.  They take the time to make everything right, prices are inexpensive and the owners are very friendly.  I've been in here a dozen times at least this past year and it's my favorite place to grab a quick bite to eat downtown before hitting the bars."}
{"text":"I order from Kabob Korner all the time as do my coworkers. I'm so glad we found this little gem in Downtown Las Vegas.  Everything is good! Even the fries. Take out fries are usually plain and easily thrown away, but they have steak fries with tasty spices on them.  The pitas are good, the kabobs or good, the gyros are good, the shrimp is good, EVERYTHING IS GOOD! We have never been disappointed. Fast delivery, friendly services, very good food at reasonable prices. I recommend kabob korner to everyone!"}
{"text":"The food is very reasonably priced and it tastes good. But that's about it. It's not fast. They seem amiable, but don't count on anything resembling service. The tables may or may not be entirely clean. And definitely don't expect your food to look like the pictures they have up on the menu.  So, if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for this kind of food, don't feel like spending much on a plate and don't mind slightly iffy table surfaces, this place will suit your needs."}
{"text":"Owner is psycho but food is good. If you can ignore psychotic tendencies of the owner and mind your own business it's tolerable. But once again let me warn you, owner is a freak."}
{"text":"Love the food, but there is no consistency in the opening times. The place could use a makeover. The appearance is a deterrent to new customers.    We miss Ali!"}
{"text":"How is it that I haven't written a review of this place yet?   I have an art gallery inside the Emergency Arts building across the street and Kabob Korner is my go-to place for grabbing a quick dinner while installing a show or before hosting a reception on First Friday.  I used to get the Chicken Gyro back when I was eating meat - HUGE, MESSY and DELICIOUS!    These days, the vegetarian-leaning me has been getting the Falafel Pita Sandwich (which isn't on the menu oddly enough).  Same yummy, messy yogurt sauce over crispy falafel with a soft, comfort-food kind of center - stuffed inside a pita with lettuce and onions (if you want them).  Huge portions for the price.  Not a lot of vegetarian or vegan options in Downtown at the moment, so Kabob Korner really hits the spot!"}
{"text":"The tikka kabob was amazing. My kids really enjoyed eating outside and loved the food. The service was good, waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place... Amazing service and food. Been coming here for 3 days in a row lol and can't get enough of their burgers (especially coming From LA) where good halal burgers are rare. Can't wait for you guys to branch out to LA."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kabob and the chicken like substance served felt.more like a.sausage. It tasted ok.  Price was cheap. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend as the Greek place in Vegas.  That is the understatement of the decade! I got there a little bit after closing but they still served me the best Greek food I've ever had in my entire life and I am 45 years old!  I strongly recommend that you get the Chicken Tikki Masala with a side of long grain rice!  If I could give this a 10 star review in a five star review I would.  It was super fresh with a base of curry and the chicken literally melted in my mouth! I was wondering if I have died and gone to Greek  heaven!!!  This was my first time in here but it will not be my last for sure.  I work right down the street from this place so now I will frequent it at least once or twice a week!!!  I think I want to try everything on the menu now ... and I probably will eventually!!!    out of"}
{"text":"What a great place.  The chicken boti I had was some of the most tenderest morsels of meat I've ever had.  The pita was great too.  This place is tucked in the corer of Fremont St. that is somewhat hidden.  It's not on the side with the big video roof thing, so you don't have the circus of things that happen on that side of Fremont.  This place is definitely a good place to crash once you've done a good amount of wandering and getting hammered."}
{"text":"This four star review could be skewwed by the copious amounts of booze I had that night, but the platter we had was tremendous. Chicken, Vegatables, lamb and rice. All marinated to perfection, and offered with a spicy sweet sauce on the side. Coming from Dearborn, Michigan, an area with the highest Arabic population in the Country, I have had the great privallage of marvalous Middle Eastern Food. Up to par or above average in comparison...."}
{"text":"This place didn't even pop up when I searched for nearby restaurants as I am staying at a hotel less than a 5 minute walk.  I was on my way to the Chinese place next door when I walked up to the buffet sign.  I walked in and to take a peek at the line and stayed.  Most indian buffets I hit mainly serve chicken.  Not this place.  Goat and lamb were also being served!  I went back for more tandoori chicken, which was super moist, and chicken tikka.  Both were delish and the naan came out hot and fresh!  Can't wait for another trip to be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here, the waiters seem really stressed and overworked although they are very friendly you can tell that they are barely keeping it together, kind of feel bad for them. But the main issue with this place is the wait time for the food . I came in right around 8:15  and was seated, I had the lamb shawarma plate. I didn't receive my food till 9:00. 45 min was way too much time, I only complained once though, and my food came out after that. But there were a lot of mad customers who were also waiting too long for their food and complaining. Time is money . As far as the food goes, the lamb shawarma was ok not great, pretty oily and kind of salty imo, rice was ok, and the \"house salad\" is just like two slice of a tomatoes a couple slivers of onions, on like 5 pieces of lettuce. The one star is for actually getting my food. 12.99 for the lamb shawarma I don't mind, but u get reemed on the can of Coke that is 2.50 yes a can not a fountain drink, that is what made me mad. Oh also watch out for the 15% gratuity that's automatically added to the bill. I woulda tipped more but hey they did it for me. This place has potential, but needs a lot of work in getting the food to the customer on time. Shoulda just gone to mint India bistro next door."}
{"text":"Bomb, bomb, bomb, this place is so bomb! Definitely the best Kabob in Las Vegas. Was my first time there last night, and I had the Chicken Kabob which was recommended by the owner Ali. Man was he right.  The Chicken was grilled to perfection, the rice was tasty, the Pita bread was also the best I've had. I also fell in love with the red date sauce which was sweet/spicy, a perfect marriage with the chicken.  Service is bomb, price is bomb, Ali is bomb. I will definitely come back here again many times in the future.  Ali's Kabob Korner is so bomb, I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie..."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall kabob place is delicious!  My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick bite that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg and this was perfect! I ordered a steak gyro and it was excellent--moist and definitely not dry, but most importantly there were good-sized chunks of meat.  I was worried we'd be gypped since the prices were so low. The one thing that I wasn't too fond of was how watery the tzatziki was. I'm used to the thick creamy tzatziki sauce from other places, but this sauce was way runny. Oh well, small price to pay for the goodness that lies within the gyros. The falafel appetizer comes with 5 hush puppy-sized bites. I will be uploading my pictures soon. =)"}
{"text":"Went there because it was within a walking distance from where we were staying. The service itself was nice but it was the worst hummus I have ever tried. We had Chicken and Beef kebab and those were okay. I would not go there again unless I am really starving to death around there."}
{"text":"We tried other Pakistani/Indian food restaurants and I have to say that this food is not impressive but it's not that bad either. I was not amazed by the food. It's not spicy at all so if you don't like spicy food this place might be better for you. The customer service was okay, same thing as food, not great."}
{"text":"Great food loved the buffet and I got a burger as well! I'd reccomend anyone in the area to try it out very relaxing and ambient atmosphere and food to match"}
{"text":"Next time I come here (and there will be a next time) I will have to try the Super Gyro.  I am on a no red meat kick, so I had the Chicken Gyro.  It was really good, with a whole lot of yogurt sauce.  A tip for anyone on a first date type situation here,  get something you eat with a fork because the Gyros are really messy.  All that yogurt sauce gets everywhere, face, hands, and drips off your chin.  Porn star face aside, I really enjoyed the Gyro.  The hummus is the bomb.  Actually, I don't know what is better, the hummus or the pita bread.  Both are the best I have had anywhere.  The pita bread is really pillowy and almost sweet.  The hummus had a nice spice to it.  Paired with the pita and it was out of this world.    It's a small place, and easily missed, so keep an eye out.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive. While waiting server didn't bother to ask for water. When I asked for water brought a small water bottle later it was charged in bill for $2. I ordered lamb karahi. Full of onion and bones in the gravy. No lamb.. I cook better food than what I was served. Never going again."}
{"text":"During our last night in Vegas, I promised my husband a good time. After watching the Queen light show, walking around with googly eyes from all the lights and smoke, we found ourselves to be a bit hungry. Kabob Korner proved to be a satisfying reminder that one can indeed find a fresh and delish meal at an affordable price. I had the Chicken Boti Kabob and my husband the beef. Aside from glancing lovingly at each other, neither of us said a word during the meal. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Super gyro is just that SUPER!  Place is a small little shop just off the corner of Freemonth and 6th Street.  Calypso teas and lemonades are tasty.  Wanted to try other items on the menu, but the Gyro was just too good to pass up."}
{"text":"The family tried out this spot after reading some good reviews on yelp. So yes yelp is what brought us here. Unfortunately after entering we had a bad feeling . Place was really dirty .. Food on floors , rice and stickiness on all tables . No menus to look at and very unfriendly man at counter .. We should have went with are gut feeling and left but know we had to try it.. First order a double cheese burger , sorry we are all out , second order #3 combo, sorry we have no type of beef at all.. Bad start to a bad looking place . After finally going for are second and third choices we waited close to 42min for are order and there were only 2 other people in place .. Then I find a hair into rice and soda cooler was warm with no ice .. Total disaster . Maybe new owners recently or yelp has something wrong .. Was a waste of a pick from the yelp goodies .. Total disaster . Enter with caution."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly prejudice. Other customers who sat down after us had their order taken and food delivered before we even had our order. Other tables were offered water and our table was always skipped. The food is decent but the service is disgusting. No tip and definitely no return"}
{"text":"I work downtown, and this place is too far to walk, but the parking is so difficult, so they deliver for a small charge, and their food is really good, and I know good Middle Eastern food, and theirs is right up there.  The food is reasonable as well, whether you work downtown, live in Vegas or just visiting, this is the place for great Middle Eastern food....thank you Kabob Korner."}
{"text":"With all of the heavy foods you find in Vegas, it is nice to find a somewhat healthier alternative and at a cheap price. They had quite a variety of different choices along with some of the tastiest rice and french fries I have had.   It is a place to get a quick bite to eat that isn't a 5$ hotdog and a beer that you get in all the casinos. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this might be the only place on Fremont that gives you more options. The lentil soup was actually surprisingly better than I was expecting."}
{"text":"I ordered the super gyro today during prime time lunch hour. The pita was soft and acted as a perfect handheld pocket for the lettuce, lamb, tomato, onions, and feta. It was a quick, cheap and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Must try this place is really good, affordable and nice atmosphere very nice people as well."}
{"text":"Review of Gyros:   Meat is allegedly Kronos, but the meat was very salty (unlike Kronos meat), so either they EXTRA salt it when grilling... or it's not Kronos.  The sauce - why oh why put a sauce that's going to melt and evaporate on the bottom of a Gyros ???? I had soup in the bottom of my Gyros basket, and almost no sauce on the Gyro .... /grrr  If you want Feta and lettuce on a Gyro then by all means, but I ordered mine without.   There was a parade of foreigners coming in and out for their Curry dishes (Indian/Pakistani) food, so I'd say it's got to be pretty good, or it's the only place around to get Halal (meat)."}
{"text":"Great chicken kabobs the red sweet chili sauce is tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken boti by phone with the owner, was told it would take an hour. When I got to the restaurant he brought out chicken koobideh instead. When I said I ordered boti the owner said \"yes this is chicken boti\". I was upset that he took me for a fool considering there is a picture of the chicken boti right there on the menu board (I was also there the day before and order the boti), but rather than wait another hour I went ahead and ate the Koobideh, which is NOT on the menu. It was good but definitely no chicken boti. Very disappointed that the owner doesn't care enough about his customers to be truthful and admit his mistake because the food really is delicious."}
{"text":"The staff were extremely friendly and the food was killer. We had the lamb super gyros and they were flavorful and filling. The lamb was tender and plentiful and the price was just right. It is a little hole in the wall downtown but if you need a quick bite, don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"This place just sucks. Food was terrible. Service was even worse some how. Just skip it all together."}
{"text":"After craving hummus and kabob for the LONGEST time, I finally decided to make a trip here. The trip was well worth it. Upon arrival, the cashier was standing there talking on the phone... took him about 5 minutes before he decided to hang up, but it worked out ok because we had no idea what to order since its been awhile. I got the chicken kabob and rice, and a side of hummus. Husband had some gyro sandwich. We'll definitely be coming back here next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Had lunch here - food was reasonably good (had the gyro with fries, other lunch guests had gyro and chicken kabob).  Was moderately busy when I was there, and kitchen/register was lightly staffed, and food took around 30 - 35 min. from order to service - which was a bit long, particularly for a lunch on a workday.  Staff was reasonably friendly.  Decent lunch option downtown based on quality of food."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!  The ALWAYS great food is almost incidental to the family environment and wonderful feel of this restaurant.  This is the REAL thing.  The first time that I ate there I was transported back to my Sephardic Grandmother's dinner table. And that is a rare compliment because my Nona's food was authentic, lovingly served and full of history and sustenance.  They serve history and stories full of heritage at this mom and pop restaurant located in a vibrant corner of the emergent East Fremont corridor of downtown Las Vegas. Come for the food but stay for the welcome to the kitchens of the Old World."}
{"text":"Real talk, I just got out of the bathroom. I have an iron stomach and this place gave me issues. The sauce on my gyro was above room temp. The veggies on it were wilted and the tables were sticky. There was also an unusual smell in there. Almost like a sewage smell. Usually I give places a second chance to sway my review but I don't think I'll be going there again."}
{"text":"4 stars for food...the super gyro and falafel were great.  2 stars for service. The place was packed, and only 2 employees.  I think the owner was working the register and there was 1 harried looking kid in the kitchen.  On a busy Saturday, that wasn't the ideal. Food was coming out to tables out of order, partial orders, and amid confusion.  Took 25 minutes to get our food.  In the end tho, the food was great."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is good.  I have to give this review because the person behind the counter is staring at me while I eat and I can feel their hate for me coming off in waves.  I'm not sure why, but I'm positive he is imagining my death.   Also the table is really sticky."}
{"text":"Ali sahib and his wife are my good friends. This is my favorite restaurant. All the food is delicious. Try the gyro, biriyani,kebabs and aloo ghobi. It's the best."}
{"text":"It was late and I was hungry, so I hope that didn't cloud my judgment too much.  Prices are beyond reasonable (a characteristic of any good food stop during a lovely evening bar hop), and the menu was... varied... I stuck with the traditional, falafels, pita, and hummus.  YUM!    The hummus had the perfect balance of tahini and lemon (and you get a generous bowl full).  It had a nice tang without being overpowered by the sesame.  The pitas were just crisp enough on the outside but warm and tender on the inside (they serve flatbreads, I think for $0.99 each, not pocket pitas), and the falafels could have been a little more done on the inside, but overall very satisfying.  I took a bite or two of a friend's gyro - which was traditional, warm, and good.  Made from meat sliced off a spit, not that creepy rectangular compressed stuff equivalent to Oscar Meyer bologna that you sometimes find at festival gyro stands.  Definitely a thumbs up when the hunger pangs hit while checking out the Fremont bar scene."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall, literally, you will know what I mean when you see the place is right on Fremont Street East, next to Inspire theatre.  I could have looked past everything that was wrong with this one and given them 5 stars on food alone, the gyros are amazing here.  They have a super gyro and its made with lamb meat, charred and with real feta and a special sauce, not cucumber sour cream, but somehting perfect for the full balance of the tastes.Pita was charred and fluffy with that warmth of naan that melts in your mouth. The chix Gryo is amazing as well, I have a feeling everything has a great taste and silly good lamb meat!   5 star food.   I had to ding em on atmosphere, dont take a date here, a little grundgy, unless she is a grundy little rabbit..lol   It just feels really run down inside, like 1.2MM tourist have been there on the chairs from the 50s, and plexiglass tables, DING!   I could have even looked past this the food was so good, BUT, the service, while it was made to order, the service guy was kinda short with me.  Whatever, give me my damn Gyro so I can slam my face it in, in my car, and my belly is super happy!   Im Happy I stopped, I will be back for a to go order, bravo!   Solid grinds here.  Get some.   CHEAP!  under 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"The lunch Buffet was great. All the Mediterranean/Indian food you want and it tastes great , too.  The service is awesome. The tandoori chicken was very flavorful , unexpectedly flavorful. The beef was well cooked and also tender."}
{"text":"We took a go to order of kebab wraps from this restaurant and trust me this is the best kebab food I ever had. The restaurant is very small in the corner but don't go by the looks .. the food is extremely heavenly. The location becomes very adventurous if you walk the street in late night hours .. It's one of the best experience food wise and also if you looking for some street adventure."}
{"text":"Good gyro and boti chicken.  Nice surprise in an otherwise seedy area off Fremont Street.  No ambiance, but the owner is polite."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while since it's a few blocks from my work and never got around to it.  Since I've been cracking out on reading yelp reviews lately and saw that one had good reviews, I decided to go check it out.  The super gyro did not disappoint.  I *LOVE* gyros and have to say this is probably one of the best I've had.  The lamb was super tender and they don't skip on the tzaztaki sauce and feta.  In fact, they even give you a bottle of it to douse on your food if you eat in.  My wifey ordered the chicken gyro and loved it as well.  Super glad I found a new lunch spot!  :)"}
{"text":"Philly Cheesesteak, hot wings, pastrami, burger, crab cakes... Everything you want, it's delicious!! Halal for Muslims. Thank you Ali for the scrumptious spread!"}
{"text":"The guy working there is very rude... I was in vegas for two days and both days during lunch hours he refused to serve food cuz apprently he was more busy with preparing an order for a convention .. Very disappointed.. Went at night as well he messed up our order and even charged us more.. Two stars cuz the food was alright"}
{"text":"Had to up the star rating here. Sure, the interior is still the capital of Grime City, but the super gyro is tasty and the chicken boti, while small in quantity, is still a good dish. Plus, I didn't see any bare feet this go-round. Seriously though, the gyro meat is solid. Moist, spicy and flavorful, it's def the star in this sammie. As usual, prepare to wait 10 min for your order. (Call ahead!)  New tastes:  Hummus (avoid) Greek salad (sub par)  Hmmm. Maybe it should be a 2.5 star rating...."}
{"text":"don't waste your time bcuz internet prices are so affordable  but when you go in the restaurant every thing almost double prise its big time rip off and service food and waiters are sucks ! This is such a bad experience and waste of money !!"}
{"text":"This is not a clean place to go. The tables are dirty and chairs are torn. I sat for my meal to get ready and when I stand up to go, there was a glue like on the chair which ruined my pants. If you want Meditranian food, there is another one just at the other side of intersection which looks way cleaner than this."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Kabob Korner. I hardly venture downtown, but when I do, I always pass by Kabob Korner and think to myself, \"One day I'll try that place\". So after a happening afternoon at Vanguard, a group of yelpers and I went here for dinner. The menu, as well as the decor, can be described as none other than eclectic. Along with the gyros, pitas, and rice plates that are to be expected at Mediterranean/Greek establishments, there were a few not so expected finds such as pizza pockets and chicken wings. The decor was interesting as well- grapes hanging from the ceiling, vintage hanging lamps, and gold framed mirrors- quite a collection. Everything felt vintage-y, kind of old...Anyways, back to the food.  Chili Chicken Pita- bright red chicken pieces and bell peppers marinated in a spicy, lemony sauce, lettuce and tomatoes wrapped in a warm, buttery pita and topped w/ a spicy (Sriracha-based) creamy, yogurty dressing. The pita itself was oh-so-amazing. The veggies were fresh. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the chicken. The chicken was fatty- grease was dripping down onto my plate- and kind of salty. Nonetheless, I did enjoy my food.  The workers are great. The food is pretty good. If you're in that area, make sure to stop by Kabob Korner. With their extensive menu, I'm sure you'll find something you want to eat."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price but food is very spicy: they add jalapeno by default!  Their pitas are excellent.  Overall, a very good deal in Vegas.  I'd come back if happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"Found out they were under new management so I figured I'd give them another chance. In past the service was awful with extreme long waits for food, and food was basically just adequate. Well the place looks the same but that's about where the similarities end.  First time I came i decided on nihari and chicken tikka masala with naan. The food was DELICIOUS, and no skimpy naan - naan was huge and tasted like back home in Karachi. Next time tried tikka and Chana masala and both high quality. I came in the weekend and had their knockout burger - wow. The new owner really is putting a lot of effort in quality of food. Keep it up. You've got a regular customer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love the Chicken Boti Kabob! We have been going here for years now, when it was downtown and the new location. Super far now but well worth the drive. The owner, I think it's him, is so nice and remembers us every time we see him. Food is great! I totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only tried this place out because someone told me I should try them out for a quick bite to eat and they are halal...So I decided to order online and to place my order. Once the order was placed I saw that you had to pay online to complete the order. I go to pick up my order and the guy Chris I believe that's his name said that the payment online didn't go through and I had to swipe my card. The purchase also came up different than it was online. Ok come to find out both purchases was taken out for the same order!!! I called the store right away and was told that I could either get a credit at the store for the amount(no thank you) or solve the matter on my end basically telling me to take care of this issue on my own...No effort what so ever...The tone was more like it was my fault for ordering online...Which now I see as a .I am so disappointed because my family and I love to eat at places that serve Halal food and I will not go back nor refer anyone too bad...I will not speak ill about tgis place, but if someone asks me I will be honest.My quest continues on for Great Halal places and customer service...As for the food I was a bit upset so I really cant speak on the taste...But if a place doesnt have good customer service then it ruins the whole experience. Not Happy...Oh and yes I did solve the matter on my end and got my money back.."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with other yelpers after CMYE at Vanguard. It's tiny, tiny place, and I'm actually surprised we FIT in there, but I'm glad we did. The gyros looked really good, but I'm the sort who ends up with more gyro meat and sauce on my shirt than in my mouth. ;P  Ended up trying the chicken kabob.. boki? I think. It came with pita bread, rice, and a small salad, for under 10 bucks. Everything was delicious, the flavorful rice, the chicken, the pita bread, everything. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE....i love everything about it...so what if the tables teeter totter a bit or you have to wait for your food?! the food and price are superb and that's all i care about!!"}
{"text":"This is good food done right. It's a no frills place. The food is cheap and filling. It also helps that the food is halal (muslim kosher). The staff is extremely friendly as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"OMG this place is fantastic!  There is an explosion of chickeny awesomeness in my mouth.  :)  This is close to my work so I will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"same great chef, same great taste,quick service and ambient atmosphere. kabob korner has been reborn and its on its way to becoming the best gourmet restaurant across the strip, preparation takes a minute but when its ready the food is perfection, they used to be on fremont, since then they've changed the game with an all new menu, fine dining, and an out door, italian style patio coming soon. if you're a foodie you have to try the chilli chicken."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Downtown location for their great food and reasonable price. The owners (a couple) used run the store themselves. We would often chat with them too.  This time I was in Vegas, I saw online that they moved into a new location. I went there and was shocked. A Hispanic girl was serving and no sign of the old owners. I asked the server if they had a high chair for my toddler and she said they did but it was broken. May be I should have left at point but was too hungry and tired after driving over 600 miles that day. Things only went south from here.   We saw the menu, and everything is severely overpriced. While were sitting, no water was served. My wife asked for water pointing at my toddler child, and the server brought in just one cup of water! Are you kidding? So we don't get water unless we specifically ask for it? I went to the restroom and there was no soap in the restroom!   While ordering, I wanted the beef biryani but she said they didn't have that. Then I asked for the Bihari kabob and she said they didn't have it either. Majority of the items listed on the menu were not available. I don't recall if I ever went to a restaurant where they had a menu but the items on the menu were not available. She pointed me to only few items on the menu that were available. We finally ordered few items (not what we wanted) and sat there for a while. They finally served the food. The food was very bland and average - especially for the price. When we finally got our check, the check had more items than I actually ordered - the bill was much higher than what it would have been. I told the server about the issue and she then corrected the check. They added 18% gratuity on the bill and with the poor service I didn't want to pay any additional tip. When I gave her back the signed credit card receipt, she didn't look happy. I guess she expected additional tip in addition to the 18% gratuity.   The old owners most likely have sold their business to someone else. The new owner has no idea how to run a business and employs servers with no training to run this place.   Do not be fooled and stay away from this place. I will never return."}
{"text":"Kabob Korner is located right across the street from Fremont Street Experience. If you blink, you'll miss this small hole-in-the wall treasure. True that the decor and ambiance leave something to be desired, but the food is really tasty. I always order the Super Gyro for $5.99. For an extra $2.00, you can upgrade to steak fries and a canned soda. The gyro meat is moist, and their homemade pita bread is soft, also, The steak fries are crispy. Manu people are turned off by the atmosphere, but if you like great food at a great price, then K.K. is for you!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was a wonderful place. The food was outstanding and the customer service was very friendly and not a phony friendly either. I would return to eat here again."}
{"text":"Apparently, the staff is friendly. This wasn't my experience while I dined there but perhaps they were having on off day. If you want to drink water and don't want to waste money on bottles, you will be disappointed to learn that the restaurant apparently doesn't have any filtered water to serve you. I chose to drink nothing in protest. Although I was irritated early on by the quality of service, the food was another story altogether.  For the price, the portion sizes were more than adequate to stuff me and my friend full of delicious kabob. I'm an ethnic Pakistani, so I know good kabobs when I taste them, and this place definitely offers the real thing. The meat was juicy and not overcooked, and the spices were certainly adequate. The rice was also authentically prepared meatless pulao-- much more flavorful than the white rice you usually get from restaurants. The naan (white bread) was tasty, but I doubt they bake it themselves (maybe they do, maybe they don't).  The wait time was reasonable considering the quality of the food.  The restaurant is certified \"halal\" (which is basically \"kosher\" for muslims) if you care about that sort of thing.  If you're a Vegas local who hangs out in Fremont, you owe it to yourself to try this place."}
{"text":"Gyros and kabobs are great. I recommend the super gyro and the shrimp kabob.   Service can be a little slow, but it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came for the super gyro plate. Damn this plate!   This is what dreams are made of.   Keep supporting small business. This place rocks.   Fuck corporations."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner. Had the chicken something platter, with nice rice and mini salad. Meat was perfect, and the date sauce was sweet but awesome with the semi spicy chicken. The hummus is off the hook!"}
{"text":"This has now gone from my least favorite halal place in Vegas to one of the best. Not sure if management changed or what but keep it up!"}
{"text":"Sorry Fat Greek, you look like the Skinny Greek compared to Kabob Korner's Super Gyro and the Chicken Gyro Pita which was what I ordered when we stopped in after Artifice.  I  could barely grab my pita with both hands because this thing was super stuffed, I ended up using a knife and fork because it was too huge to pick up and take a bite. It was very tasty, and I'm looking forward to returning to try the Super Gyro...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"1-Worst customer service 2- Dirty plates served clearly had to tell them plates were dirty with food residue. The employee cleaned it with tissue. 3-Ordered chicken biryani but the rice was really hard and rice was re warmed again. Very unhygienic dirty restaurant.  4-They bring silverware in normal tissue ridiculous. 5- Stay Away from this restaurant I asked for the owner or the manager but was refused as the server stated \"I cannot give you their name or their contact\". I did not get any type of apology from them. Shows you how bad this restaurant is. Also will seek out to State of Nevada in regards this"}
{"text":"Ate here at life is beautiful fest awesome food good price its all fresh and good quality and great portion size"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Am here for my real estate convention, looking for Zabihah Halal food before I get forced into eating vegetarian food for the next few days at the convention. It was late Sunday night,  but this place was open. Looks like a hole in the wall place,  but has good service and everything is prepared fresh (so it does take a little longer)."}
{"text":"Nothing to look at from the street, but highly recommend.  Was here on business trip and friend recommended.  Glad I tried - will be back next time I'm downtown!  (You better be hungry - they're generous with the food, esp. the kabob!)"}
{"text":"I like to go eat here every weekend but sometime I don't have time to sit n eat and they charge $14 for buffet Takeout which is $8.95 regular price. I don't know why they charge $ 5 extra for takeout buffet. That's the big down side for me and yes they are very very slow if you want quick lunch don't go there specially on weekends. They made me wait for 15 min for lamb and after waiting they replace lamb with some chicken item. They usually do this so no surprise. Food is good yes but need to think twice before we go eat there."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to go, and there is always the most interesting/eclectic mix of people in this joint.  Food: I get the Super Gyro.  You can have your choice of beef or lamb, and I've tried both.  I prefer the beef.  They put the works on this thing, and then give you two sauces to put on top of it also.  The red sauce is deeeeelicious.  It's sweet, yet tangy with a little bit of heat.  I haven't found a sauce like it anywhere else.  My husband has gotten the falafel and it is some of the best falafel he's found in Vegas.  Service: The owner is awesome.  He's very friendly and personable.  We once called when we were starving to see if they were open, and when we said we'd be there in 10 minutes, he asked for our order over the phone and had it ready for us when we got there!  I always look forward to going to Kabob Korner.  Good quality food, nice folks, and I get to watch the Food Network (they have it on in the background!)."}
{"text":"Great food! Low price! Found in the historical part of the Las Vegas strip (aka Downtown!).  My friend showed me this small restaurant off the strip. Totally worth it for the price. I definitely recommend the chicken tikka, and I had a super full plate of the most deliciously seasoned chicken, rice, & bread (wasn't naan, more like the pita bread used with gyro). The presentation of the plate may fool you since it looks plain, but once you take a bite---the flavors are amazin'! There were 2 sauces, one just like tzatziki & the other was a sweet/sour type. The red sauce was ADDICTING! It also came with a salad.  I'd say if you're on a budget or trying to save money on other major Vegas activities (clubs, drinks, gambling, rooms, etc.), this is a place you must try!! I wouldn't mind eating here everyday while in Vegas haha. There's metered parking next to the place, so just be careful to put in the right amount of quarters b/c they're pretty strict about giving tickets when you're even a couple mins over...sadly I got one since I spent too much time enjoying/devouring my chicken."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  We had the gyros, which were excellent and the #7 plate, which is shrimp kabob with rice.  The #7 was off the charts.  All the meat was fresh and the seasonings were perfect.    Don't let the looks of the place fool you, it certainly is a hole in the wall, but it is worth going in.   Lal, the owner/cashier was great and wanted to make sure we had a great meal.  I'm definitely going here whenever I can."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome. Its knockout burger is the best Halal burger I ever ate in the US! The hot wings are also very good. Other dishes are mostly Indian style and good. The price is very cheap with regards to the good quality. The owner is a very funny and lovely man! We went there four times during our five days sojourn in Vegas. It is close to the Fremont Experience and you can enjoy it. The food is Halal."}
{"text":"Took a break from working at the Beat Coffee shop across the street and popped in for lunch.  So happy I did.  5.99 for a delicious chicken gyro that was fresh and plentiful.  I have a big appetite and it made for a satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Good place for beef, chicken or shrimp kabobs, or chicken or beef tikki. Chicken boti is served . Falafel, Hummus, and Samosos are available for appetizers.  Baklava and Kulfi for desert. American food is also available. Generous portions for a low price.   Unlike most downtowns, Las Vegas does not have very many ethnic restaurants. I presume the reason is that there are so many low price buffets that it is difficult to compete. Most of the patrons at Kabob Korner are Pakistani or Indian. The food is excellent and it is Halal (if that matters to you). They are playing Indian and Pakistani music videos constantly.  Halal is an Arabic term meaning \"permissible\" i.e. the food permissible according to Islamic law. Since much of the food is also permissible under Jewish law, you often see the Mayor, Oscar Goodman, having lunch at this kabob place."}
{"text":"What a sea change  New owner Lalil know his game well We had a early dinner 1. Tandoori chicken and 2 chili chicken  Both dishes were amazing served with portion of rice and salad  Tandoori beats the chili chicken for me, superb flavor  Highly recommend this spot, go check it out"}
{"text":"REALLY bad service. Zero Customer service. Zero courtesy from the staff. I don't know how this place got to 4 stars. It's definitely a lie. Service sucks. Waited for my order for more than 45 minutes and it was over cooked and burnt. Every item is over priced. I would not even give it a single star. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Menu says \"Best Gyro in Vegas,\" and actually, it just might be--thick slices of tasty seasoned meat, onions, lettuce, tomato, and homemade tzatziki sauce--delicious. Manager was super friendly too. A great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Food here was pretty tasty, by far it is the best chicken wing in Vegas... Don't expect the wing to be batter like KFC ... Full of flavor and very minimum batter, just the way I like it...   note- must be buzz to enjoy it as much as i did otherwise the wings are a bit salty when eaten sober... =)"}
{"text":"Excellent food at an excellent price. Had the hummus and chicken kabob.  I highly recommend! (2 doors down from Beauty Bar)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been missing out every time I came to Vegas!   This time I came to Vegas I made sure to stop by Kabab Corner. It seriously is amazing. The owners are so genuine and caring! The food was just so delicious, and I had the Chili chicken and chicken shish kabab, it was worth it! My husband had a zinger burger and it was one of a kind.   The prices are affordable and the setting is amazing!"}
{"text":"A night of fighting hooks can be exhausting! The only way to ensure you'll survive is to be well fed with delicious food. Kabob Korner did the trick and then some!   Last Sunday night, the DnD group found themselves in a predicament: Main Street Station was charging rip-off prices at their buffet! Since the number one rule of DnD is to save money (actually that might be the number 2 rule, but I digress) we found ourselves scrambling to find another dinner location for our final night in Vegas. After several failed attempts to find a suitable runner-up location, a rift formed in the DnD group. Half the group wanted rotten, 2-day old Sushi and the other half wanted something fresh. Luckily, I was in the half, who wanted something fresh so we ventured over to Kabob Korner.   I have to say, Kabob Korner didn't disappoint. I ordered the Chili Chicken, which was very spicy but very tasty, as well. It is served with this sweet red sauce, which is out of this world! You'll find yourself pouring it on everything on your plate. Once you've run out of food, you might even drink it out of the cup it comes it! It's that good!   If you're an impatient person, you may want to avoid this place, as it does take a little while to prepare the fresh food. You're more than welcome to enjoy the fast, rotten, worm-infested sushi, the other half of the DnD group gorged their faces with!"}
{"text":"I loved this place last time I came here , but this time they have a limited menu n the wait is more than 1 hour,  never gonna come back here again!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. The service was great. They guy who I think is the owner was very friendly and generous. Liked the food. Good decor. Would definitely consider coming back if I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Zero Star Review  I ordered a veggie biryani and a falafel gyro sandwich.  Not worth the price and the 15? default gratuity.  Food/Service both sucked!!"}
{"text":"I dream about this! We are from Utah and every time we come in to town we have to make a stop. We have been coming here for four years. We love the Chicken Tikka (dry). Honestly though you cannot go wrong! We have also met the owner of the restaurant and he is such a nice guy. He actually cares about his customers experience."}
{"text":"I dream about this place. We are from Utah and we have been coming to this place for 4 years. We love the chicken tikka (dry). You can't go wrong though. We have met the owner and he is such a nice guy. He actually cares about his customers and the service they get."}
{"text":"Good foods and 5 star service philly steak and tikka was awesome but biryani was ok but no complaint"}
{"text":"We ordered chicken shwarma and chicken tikka. Both were amazing in taste. The food was very good in amount. Rice used in both the dishes was of good quality. This is an authentic indo/pak restaurant. I will definately be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Kabob Korner is the place to be when you live in downtown or just in town... period. I use to come here all the time when I lived at the Odgen high-rise across the street.   I give this joint major kudos for convenient location, friendly service and awesome food. I will state that the service is quickest when you order over the phone, so if you happen to stop by from off the street you'll probably wait for 20 mins and if it's weekends it'll be much longer.  Me and my hub always order the chicken plate that comes with rice and a side salad and the 5.99 super gyros that are to drool for. If you want an idea of the price you can get 2 meals and drinks for $16 tax not included. It might seem like much for a hole in the wall joint, but it's totally worth it! Good job kabob dudes!"}
{"text":"My goodness this place is GOOD!!! I found this spot through restaurant.com and I can say that I'm pretty pleased! 100% Zabiha Halal, and this is the first time I'm not getting ripped for halal meat. The owner is such a sweetheart, he cares about his customers! Also the servers gave my party (20 ppl) bottled waters (on the house)! The chicken zingy burger is delicious and their chaat is off the hook! The biryani is pretty good (decent for the middle easterners lol)  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I usually don't find myself walking around this end of downtown. The wandering hobos around here seem to be more disgruntled than my usual encounters in other parts of town. But, I'm not here to review downtown hobos. I'm here for some gyro talk.  Kabob Korner is a small, yet comfy little spot. Their menu had many more American items than I expected (wings, chicken fingers, burgers, etc.). I guess they have to make \"general public\" food to get more business. I went for something a little in between the common and traditional. For around $8, I got myself a chicken gyro combo, which came with the gyro, fries and a drink.   Gyro was only ok. It made for a decent lunch, but nothing memorable.  I even had a bite of the super gyro (lamb) from whom I was eating with, which was far tastier than mine. Still, it wasn't tasty enough for me to go out of my way to get here. I actually enjoyed their seasoned fries more than my gyro.  Will I come back? Probably not. Though their more traditional items looked good, it didn't seem like enough to win my appeal. It looks like the only reason for me to shuffle through hobos in this part of town is the coffeehouse across the street."}
{"text":"Great food!!  The best fresh pita I've ever had, and the rest of my meal (chicken gyros and hummus, with kulfi for dessert) was really good, too.  It's basically a little hole in the wall joint, but with enough decorations and stuff to make it feel rather homey.  The staff was friendly enough, but then I am a single white woman so that might have made a difference, as per the other reviews.  I would recommend this spot for a good quick bite when downtown!  Man cannot live on 99cent shrimp cocktails, ya know..."}
{"text":"Worst place to be here! Orders are not taken right! The owner goes five times in the back to check if the food is available or not they are not sure what they are serving on the table. How are you running a restaurant with bad customer service and no food! Also everything we ordered is unavailable. Not recommend  place also be aware of their gratuity charges it's a rip off!"}
{"text":"Came in from Chicago for a convention and found this place on zabiha.com. The place is nice and neat but nothing special to look at. We ordered a burger, tandoori chicken, and sweet lassi. Everything was excellent. We went back the next day and ate there again. Good food again. Also this place is quite close to the las Vegas strip which is convenient if your from out of town and staying at the hotels."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean food In Vegas. Flavourful, yummy and really delicious. Out of all the awesome food we tried philly steak sub was the best, mourn watering.."}
{"text":"I waiting on my two person order for 50 minutes after being quoted a 12 minute wait and the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  The guy next to me waited 45 minutes for a single order of HUMMUS.  I was on a tight schedule and the staff was rude.  Multiple people were waiting on orders and were getting mad.  Refunds were not being offered.  Ultimately the food was pretty good so I am reluctantly awarding 2 stars, but NOT worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"I think the location is fantastic - close proximity to all of the cool downtown joints, including Emergency Arts. I haven't had anything spicy in a while, so I opted for the chili chicken. It was one s-u-h-p-i-c-eeee bird! It came with a portion of rice and \"salad\" (lettuce/tomatoes), along with pita bread. This was enough for two meals actually, as I took my leftovers home and had a nice lunch.  The place is small and the wait can be a bit long. Other than that, this is an A-OK joint for some comfort-y grub when you're downtown."}
{"text":"We usually visit this restaurant on our Vegas trips. A halal restaurant which has been in business for a number of years. Service has definitely improved!! We ordered double cheese burgers, beef samosa and sweet lassi. Sweet lassi gets 5 stars. One of the best lassi's I ever had.  The burger was a decent size and very juicy. The beef samosa is a rare find so definitely worth it. Good filling and spicy too. They also had kabobs and other Indian dishes on their menu.  Parking can be tight."}
{"text":"Kabob Korner... where should I start. It's a tough choice when a place is so well rounded. From the moment you walk in you are pleasantly surprised by a beautifully finished restaurant which includes a very comfortable and relaxing outdoor lounge. They offer some of Las Vegas' finest hookah, and trust me, I know good hookah. The menu has something for everyone, from kids to picky eaters, and vegans to meat lovers. I've had the Super Gyro Pita, the Spicy Zinger Burger, Chicken Tikka and the Chicken Shish Kabob, all of which were executed perfectly. The balance of flavorful ingredients in all their dishes is so consistent I would fearlessly order anything on the menu with complete confidence it would be just as delicious as the last. There is even a pool table available to use at no additional charge, it takes its place in the outdoor lounge, making this place great for casual lunch, a fun night with friends, a relaxing dinner with family, etc. To top it all off though, the service is fantastic, they are; attentive, welcoming, and very kind servers. I'm sitting in the restaurant writing this review and they didn't even have to ask which hookah flavor I'd like, they already knew, I am proud to say that I have become a regular at the Kabob Korner."}
{"text":"So this place looks a little suspect when you first see it. And the inside is no better. The ceiling tiles are stained and old, there is a nice layer of dust on the walls and the floor needs to be mopped. The food is great, however decorum and cleansliness is a huge part. This place just looked run down and old. I didn't get a pic of the menu, but it had permanant marker writing on the signs and items they no longer serve covered by old receipt paper and yellowing tape. Had the inside been clean. It would have been an easy 4.5. The food on the other hand..... was delicious. I ordered the beef kabob plate and received a hearty meal. It had two seasoned um....meat logs? Rolled seasoned beef sticks which were spicy and flavorful. The pita was soft and fresh, but the yogaurt sauce seems watered down. Extreamly watered down. Also they served a sort of sweet berry sauce with it. I'm not sure how exactly they use it but I dipped my meat in it, and it was a great flavor contrast. Would I go back? No, not my first choice, but if I was drunk and had a craving for a gyro then yes. I might stumble there in a drunken stupor."}
{"text":"Seriously terrible service!! So I ordered this place on Uber Eats, and moments after my driver left, I get a phone call from the restaurant stating that they gave my driver the wrong meal. The man said I could either keep this food or come get my order. Being that i was only a couple minutes away, I happily said that I understand mistakes happen, and I'll be there shortly. About 3 mins after I hung up, he called AGAIN to ask me if I was on my way!! When I got there, he gave me the correct meal then had the nerve to ask if I brought the other one back with me! When I told him I didn't bring it with, he threw his head back like he was upset! Excuse me for thinking someone else wouldn't want the food that they already delivered to me and that we had opened to check it? Anyways, after making the trip over there after they had messed up my delivery order, the least he could do is be appreciative that I wasn't upset when I got there. Definitely didn't leave there in the same forgiving and optimistic mood as I was in when I arrived."}
{"text":"The chicken was good, but service is bad. Was not acknowledge or greet. The knots were brunt and didnt not taste as good. Probably would not come back"}
{"text":"I'm all homo about family owned places.  This joint is operated by some Punjabi Pakistani couple.  Literally, the dude cooking your food owns the joint.  I get all warm in fuzzy inside knowing that.    Normally, we order something to-go while working downtown.  The staff is always friendly.  I wonder if they ever get stiffed by no-shows...  Anyways, the meat is seasoned very well.  The rice is awesome.  The creamy yogurt sauce isn't the normal tzatziki sauce, but it's good.  The grilled pita bread just adds to the meal.  Look, it isn't Bobby Flay quality, but the place is a damn hole in the wall at the end of Fremont.  If you're looking for some good food to soak up the whiskey from Hennessey's, then head over to the KK."}
{"text":"I'm not that in to chili chicken as a dish and I still thought theirs was pretty solid.  Naan is real good too."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.   I used to be addicted to Kabob Korner since its days in Downtown LV. This was my go to place for some awesome halal burgers & many of their platters. Now, it's a place that I go to when I am desperate for some food or TRULY craving a halal burger.   Today, I ordered a chili chicken platter & the famous knockout burger. I wouldn't even complain about the price of the platter if it was decent, but I can't even give it that much credit. The presentation of the platter was GREAT, but the taste? Not so much. It was displeasing to my tastebuds and I could not believe the quality of the food had dropped to such a level. It's astonishing.   The famous knockout burger, on the other hand, was relatively decent. If I do decide to eat something from this place, it'll most definitely be one of their American styled burgers.   Seating is incredibly nice (LOVE the choice between being seated indoor & outdoor)."}
{"text":"Their chicken kabobs are excellent.  French fries off the hook!!  Not too pricey, quick, and it's usually best to order to go.  Parking maybe a little bit of a hassle depending on time of day."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet. The rice tasted day old or worse. There was a decent variety of dishes, but none of them were good. None of the food tasted fresh except the fruit and the cream for desert. I really regret eating there."}
{"text":"You will have to be patient when you order because everything is made fresh when you order it but its totally worth it. Amazing super gyro and knock out burger. Location isn't upscale by any means but its halal and yummy. Will have to return to try chilli cheeseburger. Mm mm mm"}
{"text":"Service is awesome. Decent parking lot, buffet is little over priced but the non-vegetarian food is delicious. Decent choice on strip of Vegas for people who don't have time to wait in long queues at nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"My favorite gyro in town, by far.  Always super fresh and spiced with as much heat as you want. The resident vegetarian in the crowd also claimed the falafel may be the best she's had.  We wander in here almost every time we're downtown.  It has certainly gotten busier the last few times we've been there; there can actually be a wait for a table sometimes, but everyone plays nice looking for somewhere to sit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times.   The restaurant is intimate, quiet, and relaxing. It could do with dome interior upgrades, but the service is always good. Not too inquisitive but they pay attention to the customers.   My favorite dish to date is the chicken burger. It is absolutely amazing. The patties are made from shredded chicken breast meats. The spices compliment the meat extremely well. It is very juicy. If you eat anything you MUST try the Chicken burger.   On my next visit I tried their Philly cheesesteak. It was every bit as good as the chicken burger. It was well flavored, the bread was fresh, and it was very filling.   The third trip was all about the Cheeseburger. It was excellent as well. With all of the burger and gourmet burger spots in Las Vegas, I have yet to find a cheeseburger as tasty as this. It is better than Habit Grill, Bachi Burger and Guy Fieris.   This little restaurant is a hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little gem just off the strip. The lamb Gyro was fantastically good, and it was some of the best lamb I've ever tasted. The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Ok.  Unbelievable reviews brought me to this place.  It was close enough to walk too from the California hotel, even in the 116 degree heat.  2 locals even raved about it while my friend and I were in there.  We had come to the right place.    It was not crowded at noon on the Wednesday we walked in, so we got good service with at most, a 10-minute wait for our food.  We both had the Super Gyros with fries and drinks.  Drinks were more the warm side (couldn't figure out if it was the weather or a crappy fridge) but the fries and gyros was fresh.  But I must admit, that the fries were more impressive then the gyro.  I thought the gyro was just average.   All in all it was filling for a reasonable price (Greek food can be pricey in Hawaii); the fries were fresher and more nicely fried than most places I have eaten fries (no, not just Greek places, in my life).  I even had to use the bathroom and it was pretty neat.   I can say this, if this is one of the better Gyros places, I'm only going here.  I'm scared to go anywhere else cause the others must be real crap."}
{"text":"This review is based entirely around the Super Gyro menu item, a fully loaded gyro that happens to be the best I've had in Vegas.  When I'm giving a 5 star review, I'm basically saying that the establishment will be a repeat eat for me.  If I am craving a gyro, this is the place that I want to go.  This place is located on Fremont Street just east of Las Vegas Boulevard, so coming here when I get that craving isn't always the most convenient solution.    How good is their super gyro?  A few weekends ago my friends and I met downtown at Firefly at the Plaza.  I've never been disappointed at Firefly, and this was no exception.  However, after spending a few hours at Downtown Cocktail room (another place that I've never been disappointed) I seriously had a craving for a super gyro.  So after dropping about $20 at Firefly per person (which always leaves me satisfied as far as food portions go) I was willing to get a super gyro here.  As a comparison, the main contenders for my favorite gyro have been the Paymon's, the Greek American Grill, The Mad Greek and The Olive Mediterranean Grill.  Hands down Kabob Korner is at the top of my list, for gyros specifically."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, Kabobs do not even come on skewer or contain vegetables. Their definition of a kabob is an underwhelming stick of meat camouflaged in carbs to hide that fact that it is an unsatisfying life choice."}
{"text":"Again went back and excellent food!! Löve this place. The staff gives great service!!! Will go back to kabob korner"}
{"text":"*Best Gyro in Las Vegas*  Before I begin I will say that this review is completely bias, it is only based on the amazingly delicious Super Gyro and nothing else on the menu.   Located in a terrible place to get to unless you plan on hanging out downtown Kabob Korner is THE place to go to for gyros. Now I have yet to try anything else on their menu due to the fact that I have fallen madly in love with their Super Gyro. It is a delicious creation of meat, cheese, and flavor for a reasonable price. All of which I love. Now the biggest difference that I notice between the Super Gyro at Kabob Korner and other places is the fact that Kabob Korner puts their delicious crumbly feta cheese on it and the quality of the meat. The cheese makes a huge difference. It adds another dimension of flavor that propels the Super Gyro into an addiction. Every venture down to Freemont Street requires a stop at Kabob Korner."}
{"text":"They say this is the only halal restaurant in Las Vegas. That is not true. There are plenty. Also this is definitely not Pakistani cuisine. More like fusion of Pakistani and middle eastern. That being said, no complaint here on that because the food is epic!   Almost everything on the menu is good. Their burger is different than a regular American style burger and it is really good!   1 star less due to parking issues. Downtown is not parking friendly and you have to park far away on the streets and walk here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get gyros.  Dont let the tiny restaurant and super sticky tables drive you away.  You'll eat good here.  Completely out of the way for locals unless you're already going to be at fremont street...otherwise make sure to add parking to your tab! We went here was by accident. It was late on a Sunday night and everyone was either closed or getting ready to close and my boyfriend was hungry. We ordered the super gyro with hot sauce,as recommended by the owner. He kept insisting it was the best in town..best in the nation in fact.  Well...he was close.  It was delicious.  The whole thing was perfectly made. The lamb gyro meat was carved and grilled and topped with the usual with the addition of feta and hot sauce. So good!!  We had gyros earlier that day at the competition just up the block at Cous Cous and we weren't thrilled considering it was overpriced for being so mediocre, so this made up for that."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for my second visit. Service took a long time. Not sure if that was due to it being a Friday night or not. Chicken Kabobs were tender. Salad and rice were good. Pita was also not bad. Decor didn't match the updates of downtown. Kinda fun not amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and food! Better than other nearby Pakistani restaurants! Chili chicken, subs and other Tandoor items are great."}
{"text":"With every SuperGyro comes a worthy Nemesis and Im just the guy menacing enough to take it down with a single bite! KK is exactly the type of eatery you would spot in downtown.. old, wornout, discolored light up menus.. but darn good food and dang it good portions!  The Super Gyro is always good, also the Chicken Tikka and the Beef Kabob.  What I like most about KK is they serve huge condiment bottles of Tzatziki Sauce and that tamarind sauce stuff.. them dips are the dippiest! SAUCEHH!"}
{"text":"Buffet is good. Service is not great. Been here a few times. Price was inexpensive. Inexpensive food with poor service is acceptable. Price was recently hiked up quite a bit. For the price (Now), Mint Bistro right next door is so, much better especially for the service. Please note. If you ask for regular water you get bottled water. Little hidden charges are annoying. The food is still good though."}
{"text":"Very casual, something you would find in nyc, that's the vibe it had. Booth seats with a tv playing indian music videos. The kabobs have an indian spice flavor, that I was not expecting, it was good. Came in for dinner, the food takes a while to come out, small operation."}
{"text":"The best pakistani/indian food in Las Vegas..we eat here once a week..they have the most authentic taste! The only thing they need to improve is get more people for service but they are working on it..I'm a big foodie n i rely on yelp big time so that's why writing this review to help people get the taste of back home n enjoy the best HALAL burgers!"}
{"text":"Great food great price. This hole in the wall gyro shop has a lot to choose from and is quite tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Three words come to mind: Terrible, Horrible, Un-appetizing!!! Oh yeah, forgot to mention.......horrendous customer service as well."}
{"text":"On a busy downtown Las Vegas evening, my friend and I decided to get some food for dinner. This time, we wanted to try something different than the normal pizza and food truck options. Although this place has been here for a while, I keep forgetting that Kabob Korner existed. Well, no matter, this particular night was definitely going to happen!  At first sight, the place is a little drab. Red and wooden brown are the color schemes. Wall seating also had a blue padded backing to it. They don't offer wait service here, so that might be the reason for the non upkeep. You basically approach the counter, and order. When the food is ready, you'll go up and pick it  up.   For dinner, I decided to get the number 1, the Beef Kabobs for $8.99. Two strips of beef, saffron rice and a salad of tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. The beef was nicely seasoned however I little dry. The saffron rice had a nice flavor to it and the salad, in my opinion was just there as a filler. The overall dish was alright.   I've been to Kabob Korner many times and thought their food was great. This visit was just OK, but it won't stop me from returning. In a place like downtown, it's a great option for locals and visitors alike! If you're on Fremont East, come by and check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is fresh and very delicious. Tandoori and kebab are highly recommended. It's very tender and flavorful. The restaurant is shadowed by the Mint restaurant but let me tell you this it's way better than next door restaurant (mint restaurant).If you looking for nice and quite place to have delicious meal this is the perfect place. The owner(young guy) is very attentive and friendly with the service. He recommended us some of the dishes which we loved it. Although the place is not that busy and you have to wait a little bit for your food to come, it's worth it. You will not be disappointed. We have eaten at several restaurants in Las Vegas but this place feeds authentic food. We are so glad that we found this place."}
{"text":"Came with Yelpers after CMYE at Vanguard.   Standing in line we had a laugh at the menu. For a place that has kebob in it's name, only a 3rd of the menu was of that nature. They also have pizza puffs, chicken fingers, fried catfish basket, hamburgers, etc.....I guess being the only spot serving food on that block, they wanted to represent every drunk craving.   I got the beef kebob pita. The kebob was juicy and very strong in spices. I can appreciate that since I like stuff herbaceous/floral-y foods but I think that the corriander seeds in there need to be cut up. The veggies were fresh, the bread was chewy and soft and the yogurt was generous and cooling.   For a pretty big pita and a drink at $6, it's a good, cheap eat if you're at Fremont East."}
{"text":"This is essentially for east indians and Muslims and they really use that Mediterranean theme loosely.  The food isnt great but not bad.  There is heat in a majority of the recipes, which i have asked to be cut, but they cant.  The food is very much overpriced considering the cut of meat (bottom shelf) and the sides which seem to consist of lettuce and rice.  However, they do work that meat into magic and create a meal I would consider digestible and even tasty.  They seem to have a vision for this place, that just doesn't meet the level of product they are serving and really lack some basic expectations, when spending money in a business. I gave this business 3 stars because the times I have ordered, eating the food was a pleasant experience and I did enjoy it overall.  For the Muslims this is probably a place you would want to support but if you are looking for Mediterranean food, note to reader, you wont see one olive, spinach pie, grilled olive oil chicken, feta but there is a grilled pita that I enjoyed with a side of butter."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was good! The chicken fingers were okay, but dry. They gave tons of fries. No parking unless you look.   Be carful to look at the menu. The paper one, which is more convenient, has different prices then the wall. You will be charged more money if you don't pay attention.   Customer service was okay. Not welcoming but he did remember my name throughout experience.   Haven't tried gyros, which could be good!!"}
{"text":"We order 4 lassi then waiters come back and told lassi is not good and he was sorry we order 2 coca cola instead of lassi  but the guy bring us 4 coca cola for sorry about lassi We really got happy for that that's nice bussines also food was great everything was perfect thank you"}
{"text":"I have been going to Kabob Korner since just about day one. The food has been consistently good. I am stuck on the same 3-4 dishes, so I can't speak for the whole menu. The biggest draw for me is the falafel. I would have to say it very well could be the best I have ever had. Apparently they use 2 types of chick peas, fresh parsley, along with some other goodies to make a wonderfully flavorful experience. The chili chicken (#6) is a generous sized portion of sliced chicken breast, fantastic rice, a small salad, and pita all for 8 bucks. I really like this one, but wish it had a little more kick to it. I do like my heat. Gyros are great too, as are the beef kabobs. A bit of a down side is all of the beverages come out of a cooler, so you get cans or bottles and no free refills, a minor complaint in a sea of halal goodness."}
{"text":"Filthy tables, too long waiting to get the food. Falafel was bad. Fried shrimp smelled. The humus was so bad, I have no words to describe it. Bread was fresh and good. Chicken tiki was good. Rice wasn't that good. I never go back again. It was too filthy for me."}
{"text":"The food was great. It was yummilicious. I strongly recommend their chicken burgers,  chicken tikka, and chicken chilli."}
{"text":"Was searching for Halal food and found this place when I first moved to Vegas. Dined here a few times and the food has been excellent every time. I had the Gyro and the Burger. The burgers are okay but the Gyros are incredible. I've tried the Kabobs here as well and they are phenomenal.  Only thing I didn't enjoy were the chicken strips. They were dry and overcooked. The ambience isn't all that great but who cares, the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"For the price and quality of food, this is an excellent find in Vegas, and whenever I return to visit I try to stop by there.  Great hummus and Greek salads (everything fresh) - and my nonvegetarian friends speak highly of the gyros and kabobs.  This is a family run business - friendly - low key - not fancy.  Just east of the Fremont Street giltz, this is in an area that the city has been focusing on (in terms of redevelopment), so check out the area after your satisfying meal."}
{"text":"A friend of mine loves this place but he didn't really tell me what's there to love. We were walking around in DTLV and I got hungry after having a few drinks but I wasn't in the mood for pizza or burgers...I want something grilled. Kabobs!  This place is definitely a hole in the wall. It's not fancy. Heck, it's not even clean! The booth I sat on had a hole with a bit of tape on it. Fine, maybe the food will make up for it. The first time I attempted to eat here, they were closing in an hour and the guy at this place was driving people away. We got here around early dinner this time.  Beef Tika: Comes with rice and salad. Tender, juicy and tasty piece of grilled meat. There's hint of garlic. 4/5  Beef Kabob: Comes with rice and salad. It was alright. Nothing memorable. 3/5"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot. Fantastic lunch buffet for $11.99 with fresh bread brought to your table. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried the Normal Gyro. I wasnt up for a Super Gyro since i was attending a Photo Walk. Nice menu for all varying tastes. My Gyro and fries came out in a decent time frame. Love the seasoning on the fries. And my Gyro was delicious with good sauce and fresh vegetables. The only gripe is they have Canned Soda and on the menu it lists sizes like they had a Soda Fountain. I wish they would hook it up or bring one in. Id love to have unlimited refills instead of paying a Dollar per can cause im a thirsty individual. But thats not enough to stop me from never making this my Gyro Stop."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd stop on my Jury Duty adventure I had over the last 3 weeks.  Kabobs are one of my main food groups so I was pretty excited to not have to remove them from my diet just because I was on jury duty.    I walked in and there was only one other customer sitting waiting for his food.  I wanted chicken and the cashier who I had the feeling was also the owner and/or manager suggested the #2 combo so I went with that.  It looked pretty much like what I normally get from any Mediterranean restaurant so I sat and eagerly waited.  (note: this 1st paragraph is all about the wait for the food)  5 minutes later the other gentleman received his food.   I heard him get apologized to for the wait and figured no big deal, I had a long jury duty lunch break.  5 more minutes later a lunch rush hit, and the phone kept ringing for take out orders, and several people came in for dining in or to pick up their take out orders.  10 more minutes later and I was starting to wonder what was taking so long, but I gave the benefit of the doubt to the fact that it did seem like there had maybe been several orders called in prior to my arrival.  10 more minutes later (30 total if you cant keep up) and I heard some of the girls who had come in 15 minutes AFTER I did get their names called and food delivered.  The best part was I'd heard them order and 2 of them got the EXACT same order I did!  I made sure to look DIRECTLY at the cashier/potential owner/manager at this point with a face that I attempted to convey confusion with a slight hint of anger.  He did nothing, so I need to work on my facial emotion conveying skills apparently.   I had to get up to ask what the deal was, and it was clear he had completely forgotten about my order.   I found it a little weird that he could have done this since I was SITTING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM THE ENTIRE TIME.   He didn't seem apologetic in the least.  10 minutes later (40 minutes total) I had my name finally called and my food given to me.  At this point the cashier apologized and seemed sincere about it, and I sat down to eat.  My brain had been processing how I was going to write this scathing review and I almost was hoping the food would be mediocre or terrible just so I could write a 1-star review which is very rare for me.   Unfortunately (fortunately?) the food was delicious.  I really loved the sauce the chicken was marinated in, which was different than how I'm used to getting chicken kabobs from other restaurants.  Whether eaten alone or slathering it with one of the sauces provided the flavor was really outstanding.   The pita bread was hot and fresh (it better have been!) and I also enjoyed the rice that was served with the dish.  On food alone I probably would have started Kabob Korner with a 4 star review, but I have to dock it something for that insane wait I endured.  If the cashier/owner didn't seem so apologetic towards the end it would have resulted in a 2 star review due to the length of the wait, but I'm feeling somewhat generous today so I'll go with a 3.    Side note, I talked to some fellow jurors a week later and they mentioned they had also visited Kabob Korner.  Unprovoked they immediately mentioned how long their wait was for their food.   I'm willing to bet it wasn't as long as mine, but based on that and some of the other reviews, seems as though it's a fairly common issue here.  Okay back to my mirror to work on my anger/WTF face."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch today. Visiting Vegas and wasn't quite sure where to go.. this was a very nice surprise? It doesn't look like much but the food is excellent; great quality and taste. We got the chicken boti and tikka beef, both lean and full of flavor with sides of rice, pita and salad. I would give them 5 stars, but for a place that also serves Indian food I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have more sauces (like raita or chutney) for their Naan.  Would definitely come here again though!! Our waiter was super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Inexpensive ($7.99 for a plate). The ground beef kebab was decent: two skewers of kebab served with rice, a simple salad and a pita. Sauces were a yogurt-based sauce and a sweet chili dipping sauce. The menu is a little strange since it is Indian/Pakistani run but serves Middle Eastern (gyros, falafel), Indian and American food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a late lunch and tried the chicken kabob wrap. We were not impressed. It really did not have a lot of flavor. It was really very wet and drippy. I needed at least 6 napkins, which thankfully are on the table. Maybe we ordered the wrong item. But, how can a place mess up a wrap? The place didn't seem very clean. The table was sticky."}
{"text":"And the end of the ziplining adventure, Ken M. and I stopped by this place to get some food.  Don't let the name fool you.  There is no \"korner\" involved with it's location.  Maybe a nook?  Anyway, it's prominent by the Fremont Street East bars.  The guy running the place was very friendly.  Being a first-timer, he insisted that I should try the \"Super Gyro\".  I love a good gyro, so who am I to argue with the man's logic?  So the gyro comes out, and the guy wasn't lying.  The thing was huge, and tasty.  It was actually so big and packed full of food that it started falling apart.  It was a little messy, but that's what napkins are for.  It was probably one of the best gyros that I've had in a good while.  Ken's food choices looked excellent as well.  It started out a quiet night, but the place filled up fast after we got there.  The prices are cheap, and you definitely get what you pay for, and then some.  The menu is fairly diverse, so I may have to sample a few more choices along the way, but the first impression was definitely good.  I love a good, quality hole in the wall eatery, and while there was no actual \"korner\" involved with my dining experience, the location where it sits works more than well enough for me."}
{"text":"This five star is for the super gyro. I have never tried anything else on the menu because nothing else seems to be appealing. So, I say that the super gyro and fries are delicious, and if you find yourself downtown looking for a bite, this is a good place to stop by. You will find yourself coming back for more of this super gyro."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The food is very delicious and the owner is very friendly. We tried chana masala and chicken tikka, both were just yummy. I will stop by whenever I am in Vegas for next trade show."}
{"text":"I went to get FALFEL today and there is bolts on the doors :( makes me soooo sad face!!!!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I work downtown and we attempted to order a late lunch from Kabob Korner today, and let me just say I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life! I don't know who answered the phone but we were advised that they were out of hamburgers, hotdogs, philly cheese steaks, chicken fingers, basically everything on the menu. When politely asked what was available on the menu the gentleman advised that he didn't have time to go through the menu and became agitated. After attempting to explain that we were not trying to be complicated just attempting to place an order the gentleman stated \"hurry up you are taking to much time and we have other people waiting to order!\" Thank you but no thank you we will no longer be ordering lunch from this establishment."}
{"text":"Great gyro at a great price!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the Yelp reviews were good so I checked it out - glad I did"}
{"text":"I am seriously kicking myself for not reading reviews beforehand.  I blame the drinks.  I would've done the gyro in a heartbeat!!!  That's not to say my dish wasn't good.    I got the beef kabob which was fine but not memorable.  I figured the place was called Kabob Korner so I should get kabobs!  Right?  I guess not.  $7.99 is a fair price for what you get (2 kabobs, rice, salad, pita).  I will be back for everything else they offer."}
{"text":"Super gyro is bomb! Has to be one of the best gyro I've ever had. Rather than the super thin slices of gyro, they serve thick 1/3 inch to 1/2 inch slices of gyro that's seared on the outside for a nice crunch and still retains a moist inside that is beautifully seasoned. Yogurt sauce is a little disappointing but all in all, this place is better than your average Mediterranean joint!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here cause they wanted to get some food. While we are waiting I read the menu and I see \"best gyro in Las vegas.\" Knowing myself and the foodie I am, I end up ordering it to go. Ate it at home and I can say it was the second best one I've had so far. Seems like aside from actual Greek festivals, it ranks in the top 3. Must try local spot."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and default to visiting here when I want Gyro's.  It's not the fanciest place, and is pretty small but the food is great and it's fun to watch the music video's on the TV."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the waiter was super nice! Fresh food and great vegetarian options!!"}
{"text":"This place sucked. I think you'd have to be wasted to choke this stuff down. Most patrons probably are wasted."}
{"text":"After attempting 2 different restaurants for an all Indian/Pakistani cuisine, we found this hidden gem.  Tried the goat Karahi, so tasty. Cheesy fries, mango lassi, chicken tikka masala all hit the spot.  And the waiter Chris worked so diligently to serve us and went above and beyond.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had probably the best gyro I've ever eaten at the Kabob Korner. If you're concerned about cleanliness, ambiance, or service; this might not be your restaurant. If you want some delicious, cheap, Mediterranean cuisine it comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cute little place on East Flamingo near Paradise.  I only stopped in because the Chinese restaurant next door was closed. I definitely didn't want a huge dinner plate so I ordered the beef kabob pita sandwich for 7.95(8.63 with tax). Honestly...I rarely eat this style of food, so I'd say it was good. Not the best, but it had a nice flavor. I think I should've tried something without all that pita bread. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Seemed like a risk coming in, kinda empty and wierd looking.  But well worth it just for the lunch buffet. The goat is amazing.  The menu is not what I expected but I am excited to come back."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. I came in right at closing time. The owner allowed me to order food and eat my meal even though they were passed their hours of operation. The Gyro was actually the best gyro I've ever eaten my life. Everything was fresh tasteful. It was delicious I plan on coming back and bringing friends with me!"}

{"text":"Always fresh and piping hot when served. Can't go wrong with the gyro or a good ole cheeseburger. Fries are delicious also. Been coming here for years and the food has always been consistently great."}
{"text":"Who knew you could get a fantastic gyro in Downtown LV?  Just be careful venturing down here after dark, but in the daytime it's safe as can be.  The chicken gyros were huge and SO delicious!"}
{"text":"Another gem find with the help of yelp!  Very fresh food with great flavor.  I was a little surprised the beef kabob was not just beef tips, but ground meat with spices very similar to gyro meat.  This was quite ok though since I really like gyro meat.  The fresh made pita bread with dipping sauces was really good.  Kids got cheese burgers, which were very inexpensive, but very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"For Muslims that are particular about eating halal, this place is a gold mine. A variety of cuisine ensures that you won't get bored by the menu quickly. They serve American staples, such as hamburgers, chicken fingers and wings etc., as well as South Asian variety dishes. My personal favorite is the chili chicken plate.   The location is also a plus, as if you frequent the booming nightlife that's developing downtown, it's an ideal location to eat late-night or before you decide to go out to the various downtown venues.  My only wish is they bring back a few other staples that were under previous management, such as hot dogs."}
{"text":"Good food, good location, good service.  Young kid waiting was courteous."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Their food is awesome and is full of flavor. Too bad they are not open on Sundays. But I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review to inform people that place is under new ownership and the service and food is great again!!! I have been going to kabob Korner since they where located near Fremont street and I loved their gyros but when they moved to the new location I disappointed the quality wasn't the same. Then I recently found out that they changed owners  so I gave it another chance and I was impressed the lamb gyro and chili chicken both were amazing."}
{"text":"Bro, get the knockout burger!  This place is always part of our vegas ritual.  We always make sure we eat here and get some grub to go.  They specialize in halal fast food and Pakistani cuisine.  Its perfect for families with children.  They also have hookah outside ;)."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Excellent abd fresh tika chix and bopa chix. The entree had generous chicken pieces snd rice. Even the pita was good. Will visit again.   Be prepared for a 10 minute wait as they freshly prepare the food. But, there's always a Bollywood movue playing on the tv."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, my boyfriend wanted to order another gyro and my Chana masala was perfect.  Server Chris was attentive and enjoyable.  We'll be back!"}
