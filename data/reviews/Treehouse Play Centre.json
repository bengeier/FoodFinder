{"text":"My son and I love to come here on playdates! The baby area is very clean and padded - even for little ones who aren't walking yet! My son loves the play structure too and we can go down the slide together. You can bring food for the baby and order some food and drinks for yourself. They have high chairs too which means I don't have to bring my own booster seat in."}
{"text":"We love Treehouse and the friendly staff. Really nice and clean with a laid back atmosphere, unlike the industrial feel most play centres have."}
{"text":"The playground is nice and clean.  They closed regularly for clean up.  They have a padded area for smaller babies too (0-crawlers). We went there few times either for birthday party or kids' gathering event, my kids (0-3) still had fun even they already there few times.     I love they have straight rule: no food in the play area so you wouldn't see kids munching while they were on the slide or inside the tunnels.  The staff would stop you/kids when they saw people eating in the play area; this is why this place is cleaner than other playgrounds.  They care about their place so much, they take very good care of it.  The staff were friendly and nice.  They didn't mind to hold your baby while you're trying to settle another kid.  I haven't get a chance to relax and try their food/drinks yet so I couldn't give any comment about that.  (I was busy chasing or holding my kids)"}
{"text":"Been a few days ago for a bday party.  The place is really clean and cozy well managed for sure.  The thing that I hated is that the staff and management seems to be really attached to money and cheap. After the party, we were asked to leave the place (the common area), almost thrown out. Come on, the kids were having fun and the birthday parents probably paid good money for the party! I found it really cheap, disrespectful, closed minded, provincial and plain stupid. Until that moment, I was really excited to have found such a good place close to home, I was actually planning to come back for a coffee with my son. After been treated like that, no way... The place is virtually empty during school weekdays, they should try to be more friendly if they want to keep the business going... Too bad..."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. Took my 3.5yo & 15mo and they both loved it!   Size: Small. Nice two story foam/padded play structure with some obstacles and two wavy slides. Underneath the play structure, there is a small area with large stuffed animals and a small wooden slide for infants. There's also a Thomas the Train Step 2 Ride On Toy on Tracks that my 15 mo really enjoyed! To the side of the play structure, there is a foam padded play area for infants/crawlers with an assortment of toys. There are small cushioned couches for parents to sit around. There is also a bookshelf full of great books for both infant and toddlers alike.   Cleanliness: Excellent. Everyone is required to wear socks beyond the main entrance.  Service: Incredibly customer-friendly. Since it was our first time, we were offered a quick tour of the place and given the the option to pay when we leave.   Price: $12.50 for 2 and up plus $5.50 for my 15 mo. A little on the pricey side if you ask me (hence the 4 star) but still worth it!  Will definitely come back again when I need a nice break."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and just had a birthday party (ages 1-5). It has been the best party I've ever hosted, the space is exceptionally clean and exclusively ours for the party (which meant no big kids trampling around the smaller ones). The service was amazing and is absolutely the distinguishing factor- I was able to actually enjoy and chat with my guest because the host Maria was so friendly, helpful and efficient. She helped me with the setup, clean up throughout/end of the party, offering coffee/tea and coordinating guests for cake and even cutting and serving it! Things that usually I'm running around for the whole party! Most guests were asking about the place because they also enjoyed it so much. I am so happy I found it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to chill with friends and babies and most definitely if they are hosting a kids party."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Treehouse the first time were there last year. I didn't know what to expect with all the indoor playgrounds that are around now. It was very clean, well organized and the group we were with ages 1-9 really enjoyed themselves! We were recently invited there for a party and my kids in their words \"had the best.time.ever!\"   There are padded mats & toys in a closed off section for babies. There is a lot of space for parents to chill while the kidlets play. Washrooms were very clean. I had to mention that because a lot of places leave theirs a mess until closing with minimal tidying up - not at Treehouse.  Birthday parties offer exclusive use of the playground & party room. Coffee, tea, water & juice is included in pricing, but no food (you can bring your own).  They have a cafe with drinks & food (made from scratch!) and great snack plate option for kids. Treehouse is also a \"Nut aware facility\" which is very important for me since 1 of my kids has a peanut allergy.  The thing that impresses me the most is how nice & friendly the staff are and how clean the play centre is. It is one of our fav indoor playgrounds to go to in York Region.  My kids are looking forward to going back this month!"}
{"text":"Great place for my 3 year old to roam about when it's a little humid outside.    Cheap and good way to kill some time.  Not the biggest indoor playground but it does it's job.  Lots of places for adults to sit down.  Only downside is the crawl spaces are small for adults to supervise but I suppose that's true for most indoor playgrounds."}
{"text":"When you have a little toddler with a ton of energy to burn - this place is a great option to go check out.  It is more geared to the younger set - which makes it easier to for me to breathe easy - since I don't need to worry about my daughter getting mowed down by an older child, who might be bigger and stronger than her.   Pricing - because the place is smaller than other places and they have a great rate with the LWAB group (Tuesdays afternoon) - that I usually took advantage to come by and play.   Cleanliness - this place is pretty clean and tidy. I have never found this place to be overcrowded - which helps.   There is a small snack bar that offers food and they have a separate room for eating and feeding.   Overall, I like this place since it is quieter and not as overwhelming to deal with like some of the other indoor playgrounds - and I love how it is specifically aimed at the younger toddling set."}
