{"text":"Worst service and meal I have ever had. 1 hr 20 minutes. Only got a salad. Actually at 1 hr 30 minutes we left. Sorry. I would never recommend anyone eat here. Absolutely ruined an evening."}
{"text":"Very un impressed with the food. The fact that they charged $19 for an average tasting sushi roll is somewhat insulting.  Service was pretty good however, and the only reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Exceptional service!! Myself and my mother just had dinner here during our stay at the westin as it is the night before my wedding. Our servers name was Daniel and he was absolutely fantastic! So amazing and He really made the whole experience unforgettable. He even gave us each a class of champagne to celebrate the upcoming wedding! Very personable and professional. 

   The food was absolutely next level. Best sushi I have ever tasted. So much flavour and exquisite presentation. We had the happy hour special and the amount of food for the price was incredible. 

Would highly highly recommend a visit here not only for the food but for the overall experience!"}
{"text":"We were ecstatic there was a Japanese restaurant at the Hotel, couldnt wait to try it. Everything was excellent from the Pinot Grigio to the complimentary Lava cake for dessert. We started with the Tomato Ceviche..interesting, very refreshing and a perfect start to our meal. Tuna sushi was the best , i had to repeat the order. I love when sushi places put sesame seeds on their rolls like the spicy tuna roll . Ribeye was generous and perfectly cooked. Our server was witty and on top of things, very knowledgeable as well. The only thing i wish they had were glasses of sake instead of bottles. I wanted to try a glass or two not an entire bottle."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful view. 
A must if you are nearby, and worth the drive if you aren't."}
{"text":"I'm going to be daring and say that Marssa is some of the best sushi I've ever had, and I've had a lot of sushi in my day and in some really high end places. Sushi at it's best is something that not a lot of people get to experience and I'm sure there's better, there's always someone better, but this is pretty top notch. It's super quality, creative, beautifully presented and downright delicious. Not to mention that the environment and atmosphere is great. Perfect place to get out of the city for a bit and be treated to a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Last night we had dinner at this restaurant for New Year's eve. It was a fixed menu and I want to say that probably one of the best meals we've had their in a long time chef Kaz did an awesome job. The sushi the steak everything was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend you revisiting this place as the hotel is under new ownership and now moving in a positive direction.

All I can say is I've tried every sushi restaurant in Henderson and every place left me extremely disappointed except for Marassa it's a little bit of a drive but it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"Our server, Allison, was fantastic, however the manager on duty was not.  We requested to sit near the window as there was an open table.  Our hostess was about to seat us there when the manager quickly arrived to say that it was reserved.  He wasn't very polite.  Well, that table was not occupied until over an hour later and by then more tables near the windows opened up.  The manager catered and swooned over the diners/friends at that \"reserved\" table, even offering to open the windows that allowed a better lakeside view.  He was so attentive to them, but not everyone else- there were other diners sitting alongside the windows and the manager never offered to open it up for them.  This normally wouldn't bother me, but his actions were so clear, blatant and disgusting.  The omakase was amazing, but the manager's attitude left an ugly taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Yuk. Honestly...besides the sake, what a disaster. Even the edamame was in edible. I went there a couple years back and it was delicious. Not sure what happened but definitely go somewhere else. Horrible."}
{"text":"The decline of this restaurant is very disconcerting. The service remains great but over time the menu has become more limited and there has been a noticeable decline in sushi quality. These items will have to be addressed for my continued patronage."}
{"text":"We called to make a reservation and from the person that answer the phone we were told didn't need one because was Wednesday..we drove 40 min To get there ..once in we were approached by a guy probably a busser that said the restaurant was closed for the evening ..we said we called earlier to be there at 9 pm..he said again that they were closed ..another person stepped in and walked us to a table..they gave us a free dessert to make up the earlier inconvenience it was a special night for us they just ruin it...
We tried four dishes ..the tuna carpaccio was good , the Marssa raw bar platter was good the fried rice was ok but not done properly ..rice wasn't mixed well ..the spicy seafood miso contained 1 shrimp and one piece of crab..not our taste..the service at the table was ok."}
{"text":"this is easily the most overrated 5 stars on yelp and leaves me quite puzzled. the sushi was mediocre at best so i don't know what the fuss is over the master chef. service? for a four diamond restaurant, it was definitely subpar. we were there on a very slow night with about 80% of the restaurant empty and 2 people sitting at the sushi bar, yet took 30 minutes to get our appetizers. we ordered a couple of rolls which also took awhile, but was not memorable at all. the hot entrees (lamb and kobe short ribs) were very good, but the damage had been done and our experience had been ruined by the time they came out. i don't mind paying up for a good dining experience so i was lured in by the high ratings of this restaurant, but i did not get what i paid for. truth be told, this a 3 star restaurant, but considering the prices and the overly enthusiastic 5 star ratings, i feel a 1 star was appropriate to balance out the reviews."}
{"text":"Best sushi  in the USA  
If you like NOBU give MARSSA a try.   You will NOT be disappointed.  I was STUNNED at the quality and exceptional sushi presented at MARSSA...then I found out Jero trained the sushi  ?!  Best !!! Insanely presented and fresh!
PS that goes for Morimoto too! MARSSA costs less and is better in many ways. Please discover this place !! Great Saki selection and super staff.
You will never be rushed. Prepare for a sushi experience from Heaven"}
{"text":"This place is so over rated and over price.  Don't know why people gave 4-5 stars. Is it bc they never have great sushi before or am I too picky?  Service was horrible. I ordered crunchy el, hamachi fiesta and marssa box. The crunchy el had too much cream cheese in it and the marssa box was ok .  I ordered fruit and Mochi for desert.  The wait was so long, I just went home.  Over all, the food is mediocre but over price (small roll for $20, common people, what are you thinking). The service could have been better.  I would not recommend this place.  Save your money and go to I Love Sushi in Henderson."}
{"text":"We are loosing a Lake Las Vegas institutions. Las Vegas only master sushi chef, Chef Fuji, is leaving in September; taking a job in Beverly Hills. If you haven't had the pleasure of enjoying Chef Fuji's amazing creation time is running out. 

Oh, and try the creme brule, you won't be sorry or feel guilty."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Complete package here with a beautiful setting on the lake, friendly and attentive service, delicious and creative dishes. Sake cocktails are yummy. We enjoyed a sushi platter, Hawaiian style opakapaka, and filet. All were perfectly prepared of highest quality. Desert was a creative cheesecake. Terti was a great server who took care of us without hovering. Will return!"}
{"text":"Good food. Sushi is my all time favorite food, so I'm a tough critic. Wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but it was good. I'd recommend and eat there again."}
{"text":"It's all about the flavors! The Master Chiefs will not disappoint you! Come check out Marssa you will not leave unsatisfied! Our server was EXEMPLARY! I came with my little angelic nephew who isn't very angelic and our server just gave him the BEST night of his life. I believe his name was John. He's skinny, short hair, and said he had kids of his own. Absolutely a superb experience."}
{"text":"What an excellent night! Marssa will please any foodie whether they are seafood fans or not. We had the land and sea dinner for two. And it was well worth the money. My fiancé doesn't like scallops all that much but he won't stop talking about them. The only bad part was I had to share them with him, usually I get them all to myself! We ordered two orders of Uni and Hamachi because they were so fresh. The Uni was like butter and the Hamachi melted on your tongue. The ahi was placed atop a wasabi mashed potatoes served on dry ice. The Wagu beef was tender and juicy. Sid was our waiter he was great. The head chef Kazuki was wonderful, you can tell he loves what he dose and should be proud."}
{"text":"This is going to be a strange review...but I ate at Loew's for their Thanksgiving brunch (which was served in Marssa).. they had both traditional Thanksgiving fare as well as some great Asian dishes as well.  It was unbelievable!...I'm planning on going back again next year, just because the staff and the meal were both so amazing.  Oh, and our daughter loved it too.  They had a children's buffet area, with all the chafing dishes at kids level...the attention to detail was fantastic.  I don't remember the price...but I want to say it was $50 per person...which seems like a great price in retrospect (oh, and I think young kids were free).  An amazing find...

Update:  Since Westin took over the hotel, the Thanksgiving brunch definitely took a hit.  No more turkey carving station and less food options overall.  Still a 4 star experience though, what with the beautiful venue, great staff and solid food."}
{"text":"This may be the one time Yelp reviews have let me down, or I may have visited on an off-day, but the awesome reviews did no live up to my experience. 

First off, for what you're getting, every dish is ridiculously overpriced. I ordered the Nigiri Set ($29) - which included eight pieces of nigiri. I would expect for $29, the quality of the sashimi to be top-notch, but disappointed to bite into dry snapper on top of over cooked rice. The salmon and tuna were okay, but the same quality I can get at an AYCE place. 

My friend was equally disappointed with her Chicken Pancit ($32) - nothing about it was authentic and I had a bite and 100% agree it was way too salty. 

Needless to say, both of us left without finishing the food and frustrated to have wasted money at this place. Although the service was fantastic, we would not come back here again. For the rest of our stay at the Westin, we were much happier dining at Rick's Cafe."}
{"text":"WOW ... who knew some of the best sushi i've ever tasted would be in las vegas. Stayed at Loews for my B-Day went to eat here for Dinner.. spicy tuna roll is amazing.The Kobe short ribs one of the best things that I've ever experienced Im thinking about them right now. MUST GO."}
{"text":"Went to Marssa last night 11/3/17  it was awesome from the cocktail waitress at the bar to the dinner. We were seated at a very romantic table with a view. Allison our food server and her assistants were spot on.  We were treated like VIPs. The food selection on a the recommendation of Allison was a 10.  The Manager on duty came over to our table to make certain our dining experience was nothing short of excellent. I would definitely recommend Marssa to anyone wanting good food, a chilled atmosphere and top notch service without having to do the strip thing from the Valet guys to the sushi chefs. Thanks. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and it did not disappoint! We started off with a crab roll...so good! I ordered the rib eye and I loved every bite of it! I'm a tiny person, but I have to say, I did a good job attacking the steak! The cobia fish prepared Hawaiian Lau Lau style was a must have - coconut milk, lemongrass, banana chutney. I ordered wasabi mashed potatoes and it came out was expected. The fried rice was good, I had better, but good. The evening was topped off with some banana dessert and I loved it! Everything about this restaurant was great, reasonably priced. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here for the first time last night for dinner. We were greeted warmly by the entire staff, and seated by the window for a view of the lake, albeit was to late in the evening to catch the view. A complimentary champagne toast was delivered to the table! So sweet! My brother is a steak connoisseur (we are from Japan and are used to eating Kobe Steak) and he was greatly pleased with the wagyu rib eye. The rest of us ordered sushi, the salmon and hamachi carpaccio were incredible! Salmon belly was melt in your mouth, although, I wasn't the biggest fan of the added olive oil drizzled on top. The hamachi was what my mom described as \"walking through a field of daisies and lavender\" it was pleasantly earthy with the pear pico de Gallo and greens. The seared albacore was INCREDIBLE, it is always a favorite dish of mine and Marssa's delivered. The tiger roll made me sit back in my seat and roll my eyes in delight.
The atmosphere was great, it was warm and magical dining with my family. Our server was a spunky and kind woman, we got to share some laughs each time she visited our table. She delivered a mochi ice cream sampler to us that was yummy (and I don't even like mochi all that much.)
All in all, a wonderful dinner. Sending lots of love to the staff and kitchen! Thank you for taking such great care of my family and I!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday last nite and had one of the best meals ever. We had the Sea Journey for 2 with 6 different items. Each item was perfectly cooked, the venue was beautiful and the server Allison was the best. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Living in kinda-remote Lake Las Vegas you're just happy being kinda-remote but when you have a place like Marssa in the neighborhood it makes the question of 'where should we go out? ' a no-brainer. Full disclosure we have yet to try the steaks (sorry) at Marssa but the sushi is AWESOME! Not inexpensive but so well with it. Faves are the Tiger and Diablo rolls. Marssa has a great happy hour menu and the rest certainly won't let you down. This isn't a one-time 'yeah that place was ok' it's a never-let-you-down experience. If you can catch the sunset from the dining room with the awesome Eastern view you're in for another treat. The mountains glowing pink is just picture perfect. Try it. I am pretty sure you'll like it. Or love it. Or get addicted. Whichever."}
{"text":"We came back to Marssa yesterday and the menu has changed since the last time we were here, but is still great.

Seared scallops to start - the best I've ever had. 
The sushi was fresh and good.
The pancit is still yummy.
The spicy filet cooked in a wok was fantastic.
And the Tokyo Mule was a great cocktail!
All of this topped by great service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely 5+ stars for Marssa!!
Had the pleasure of dining here last month and WOW what a great experience. The atmosphere is great, the views amazing, the presentation on point and the food to die for!!!
Excellent menu from land to sea with a perfect variety for every palette out there. Was very excited to try different things on the menu new to me. Was more then pleasantly surprised with the Lau Lau Halibut OMG HEAVENLY!! This dish was unbelievably the best Halibut I have ever had and I'm a Seafood Lover from Boston, MA. So I know nothing but the best seafood growing up in New England. Let me tell you from the moment it came out I was in awe, the presentation in the banana leaf was BEAUTIFUL, the sweet smell of the bananas and coconut milk were heart warming, once opened there was the Halibut covered in the banana chutney with Yukon potatoes just a perfect dish. The flavor AMAZING, the Halibut cooked PERFECT, my favorite dish by far :)) 
I enjoyed other dishes too, the Tuna Cocktail was great, the dry ice gave it some flair to the table. 
Salmon Carpaccio YUMMY sliced perfectly thin, amazing flavor loved the sauce!
Ribeye was so flavorful loved the ginger garlic sauce, med-rare I chose and it was cooked perfect.
Ended with dessert Mochi of course lol I have to try it wherever I go! Great flavor selection and was very satisfied.
Overall excellent dining experience here at Marssa would highly recommend it to anyone coming to this side of Henderson. The views of Lake Las Vegas are beautiful and it's such a relaxing environment here. Perfect for when you don't want the noise and combustion on the Vegas Strip!
Took some great pics too :)"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were a bit too high for this place.  Maybe I was blinded by the shiny Four Diamond award, or the fact that Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title was mentioned every 5 seconds at dinner.  I don't know, but it didn't quite make it for me.

When I walk into a restaurant with so many accolades, I expect to be wowed.  Our table ordered the first round of cocktails and some edamame to kill time while we waited for a couple of friends who were running late.  Our server was very nice, but seemed a little unclear about the cocktail menu.  It seems that the restaurant does not have their own bar, rather, the lobby bar makes the drinks and they have to bring them down.  OK, no problem, but unusual.  Apparently most people don't order cocktails, just wine and sake.  He also had a couple of assistants who introduced themselves to the table, but didn't have answers to any questions.  

The edamame was pretty bland, but it was a decent snack with our cocktails.  For round two, I ordered a Bombay Sapphire martini, very dry.  It arrived with way too much vermouth.  Disappointing.

Since the chef is a master sushi chef, I was expecting some inventive and creative options on the menu.  I was sad to see that there were only about 10 choices of rolls, most of them involving tempura, and the usual suspects when it came to nigiri and sashimi. 

I was pretty excited that foie gras was an option, but I decided to go with the sushi & sashimi sampler, which is supposed to be 9 of the chef's signature sushi creations.  I figured I would give the chef free reign.  I even told my server that I am very adventurous when it comes to sushi and that Chef should feel free to try out something new, or whatever he wanted.  He said something like, \"better be careful or you'll get the uni.\"  I said, \"um, yeah, it's my favorite, I hope the chef puts it on there...hint.\"  I then allowed myself to dream of all the natto flying around and some weird fish I'd never heard of.  Ahhh...

But no.  My sampler arrived, and while beautifully presented, I learned that 4 out of 9 of my bites were crab based.  The other 5 were two pieces of tempura roll, spicy scallop, cajun albacore and a teeny piece of my beloved uni.  The sushi was fresh and good enough (well maybe not so much the scallop), but I am kind of upset that I spent $38 for the Forrest Gump of California Rolls.  Crab avocado, crab cucumber, crab ceviche...

I'm not sure if it was just the price of the dish that was holding Chef Fuji back (I know he's got some good stuff up his sleeve - and I would have been willing to throw in a couple more bucks for the good stuff), or maybe he didn't believe that I could handle anything more than the basic.  Or maybe he had the night off.  I'm confused, and sad.  A tear."}
{"text":"After a visit to Tokyo, Japan we felt that every SoCal sushi place was sub-par. Then we visited Marssa...this place is amazing and can easily match and sometimes even outclass our Japanese sushi adventure. Unforgetable!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner on New Years Eve, but on New Year's Day brunch was mostly leftovers from the night before."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite dish ever...

I would never do this dish justice by attempting to describe it but all I can say is that I've never had anything like it before and whenever friends ask me where to eat I can't help but to bring this place up just for this dish alone! You can pick any fish you'd like & it's cooked in a banana leaf with coconut milk, potatoes and bananas. The aroma alone might cause you to make a sound that isn't appropriate at any restaurant :) 
Amazingness doesn't begin to describe the dish. I could eat it every day, all day for the rest of my life. For this dish alone I have to give this place 5 stars. 

As for everything else, it's ok, nothing spectacular. The restaurant itself is very dated and desperately needs a facelift. It overlooks the lake which is probably beautiful during the day but at night you can't see any of it. All the other dishes including the sushi are overpriced & good but again nothing amazing. 

I drive from Summerlin for this one fish dish cooked in a banana leaf which is crazy but every bite of it is so worth it! 

I will be back just to order my favorite thing ever over & over again."}
{"text":"Amazing Dining Experience  and Service. I would give them 10 stars. Chef prepared the most delicious selections and the service was 2nd to none. I recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great food and a great service. Disagree comletely with the guy earlier who knows about sushi."}
{"text":"Dined here on saturday night.  We've ordered the Omakase 100, which is a chef's signature 5 course tasting menu cost $100.  If the courses were chef's signature, then he surely don't know how to handwrite.  The first course was a poke like dish; bit sized chunks of tuna in onion vinegar puree.  Not a fan of onions, so this course was so-so.  It was more show than tasty (since it was served in a bowl of dry ice).  The second course was slices of sashimi consist of two slices of tai (red snapper), kanpachi (amber jack), and hamachi (yellow tail).  Both tai and hamachi was topped with delicious yuzu dressing, but the almighty kanpachi was lacking in favor (which was quite disappointing).  So, dinner was proceeding quite well, then it made a U turn.  The third course of bit sized sliced wagyu, lobster, and tuna on crispy cracker were very uninspiring.  The taste were from bland to overly sweet and salty.  The fourth dish featured miso yaki seabass, which was overcooked and tasted more like swordfish.  However, the nigiri plate (fifth course) was the best of the night; salmon belly, uni, king crab leg, and tuna.  I never had Uni nigiri styled (typically served gunkanmaki style), it was quite amazing.  The salmon and tuna was perfect as well.  So, was it worth the $100 or $20 per dish?  No.   Bottom line, just order the sushi and skipped the rest of the fushion \"stuff.\"  Please keep in mind that the sushi is about 25% more expensive than your average sushi bar."}
{"text":"During our staycation we trird this steak and sushi restaurant out. Had a pretty decent happy hour. The service was great, they were very accomodating considering we haf our 5 year old with us. The Manager came to say hello and the staff was very nice. The ambiance and views overlooking the water were wonderful. I took one star off my review because my biggest peeve is when a restaurant cooks dishes with chicken and doesnt label the item \"dark meat\". I absolutely dislike dark meat and haf I known the fried rice and the other chicken dish I ordered was dark meat I wouldnt have ordered it. The price point is up there but again we stopped in during their happy hour amd still managed to spend $100 on two people, with only 1 alcoholic beverage oh and 1 desert.  But hey its staycation right?"}
{"text":"This place was all right. The food was decent but not worth what we spent. We only got soups and salads."}
{"text":"Excellent!

Simply fantastic food, view, ambiance - and especially the service. We had a toddler with us, and they went above and beyond to accommodate him. Couldn't ask for a better evening.

Culinary highlights include - honey walnut shrimp, specialty rolls, and a fresh nagiri selection.

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I need to eat here more often. Thinking of it cuz I ate here for Restaurant Week last year and it was unbelievable. We also ordered off of the regular menu I can truly say this is one of the best dining experiences. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and it was FANTASTIC!  One of the best meals we have ever had! Our group shared several plates so we could try a little bit of everything.  The appetizers: every single bite was perfect. The scallops and walnut shrimp were delicious.  We then ordered the Raw Bar.  OMG, this is a must.  This was my personal fav. It was plated very nicely and everything tasted so fresh.  The salmon, tuna, yellowtail and albacore were so delicate, light and fresh.  Next came the sea bass.  It was beautifully served in a giant banana leaf.  It had this magical coconut sauce that was so perfect.  The guys ordered some meat. It didn't disappoint!  The wagyu NY strip and the lamp chops.  Again, perfect! They were served medium rear and were so tasty!  The strip steak came with this yummy sauce that just enhanced every flavor.  We also added a side of the fried rice that again, did not disappoint.  Wow, what a meal!  The chef is definitely getting it right!  Our pictures do not do it justice.  Our waiter, Daniel, was fantastic and very knowledgeable.  He recommended this fantastic Japanese whisky that we all loved!  I cant say enough great things about this place.  A must go!"}

Dont care for flare, dont care if you want foofy shit.....He's one Cool, Calm cat , friendly, hands on, one of the BEST places i've ever had for amazing sushi.... I know, what your thinking....A Japanese Sushi Chef..... indeed rare these days....

Go Omakase......no need to flinch....just do it.... The dinner entrees are very good, but Chef Fuji is the reason this joing rocks.....

Tuna Cocktail.....nuff said....

If its too far for tourists...by all means stay away... i like these hide away gems....."}
{"text":"We love Marssa! I ordered the Filet Mignon and fried rice. The dipping sauce for the steak is phenomenal! One of the best steaks I've ever had! Cooked perfectly and so tasty! The California rolls are made with real crab. So delicious! We also loved the chocolate Lava Cake. I also ordered the pecan shrimp which was so good! We live in the northwest part of Vegas but we will definitely drive 45 minutes just to eat here! The servers are fantastic and go the extra mile to make you happy! Edy was our Server and was so kind to my daughter. He brought her some watermelon pearls out after dinner and she loved them. We had a great time. The atmosphere is great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicest restaurants at Lake Las Vegas and I ate here many times when I was in the area over a month.  Hummm it has to be described as an Asian fusion restaurant with sushi options.  The food was interesting and sometimes creative.  There were some good flavors in some of the dishes but much of the sushi seemed to be very Americanized.  The prices seemed high for what you got and I found I usually liked the steaks and cooked fish better than the sushi and other Asain \"fusion\" dishes.  The omakase tasting options were generally good but sometimes a bit too progressive for my tastes.  The best thing about this place is that there never seemed to be a wait and a reservation was never needed."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner yesterday with my fiancé and had a lovely time! Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but we had such a nice waiter who answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. We came with a Groupon too and there was no lack in service at all. I'm so glad we came."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come here for dinner last night... The most amazing food and drink ever... BEST sushi and steak we've ever had... The stuff is amazing... Totally worth every penny and more...  Can't wait to come back... We came here just for happy hour just to get a little snack Left to go wonder around and see other food place... But come back for dinner cause nothing else sounded good BEST DECISION EVER..."}
{"text":"Ok so we stayed at hotel and walked by this place about 50 times and honestly just blew it off. We decided to try it and damn what a blessing in disguise. The filet minion was amazing.  We also had the spicy sashimi salad. I have had plenty of sashimi salads in my time but this was absolutely amazing. A meal in itself. Had so much sashimi it was crazy for under $20. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have ate at a lot of restaurants here in Las Vegas and never thought of dining at the Westin for fine dining. Boy was I proved wrong, Marssa's is by far on the best overall dining experiences we've had. From the food and beverage supervisor Abdul making us feel like a VIP to the view of the lake from our table. The food was outstanding! I can't wait for our next date night because we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Maguro sashima is fresh, the seafood coconut curry udon has amazing flavors, and the Opacapaca Lau Lau is delicious. A bit on the pricey side but everything we had was so good. Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Unreal! This was the biggest disappointment I have ever had at a restaurant. We sat down ready to order for the happy hour menu and we waited 15 minutes for a waiter to visit our table. We asked the hostess for a table for our kids to sit together and we were given rude attitudes from the hostess and a waitress that was standing near by. The pictures will show that the place was completely empty."}
{"text":"Very solid food preparation and stellar service. 

Marssa is the 'high end' restaurant located in the Westin Lake Las Vegas. I brought my girlfriend to this hotel for a very special dinner before a surprise event that I was planning, and the level of food and service was on par with what I was expecting. The restaurant decor is a bit understated and the long, narrow space doesn't exactly command a grand presence, but the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the beautiful Lake Las Vegas created a quiet and elegant atmosphere. 

After reading through some of the reviews, I felt it was wise to stick with the more traditional entrees, rather than go with their sushi menu. Not to discredit the sushi chef in any way, I've just never been to a restaurant that serves great steak and prepared fish, that also serves impressively good sushi. Maybe being in the middle of the desert had something to do with it as well. I went with their grilled ribeye which came with nicely textured mash potatoes and shishito peppers, while my girl went with the John Dorry cooked Hawaiian Lau Lau Style. The quality of my ribeye was fantastic, and I enjoyed every tender bite of the solid beef flavor. The John Dory was cooked perfectly in banana leaves and served with a delicate yet tasty sauce. Both of our entrees were executed perfectly and were delicious. 

The service we received was excellent as well. Granted it wasn't very crowded on a Saturday night, but our server was knowledgeable and attentive, while still giving us our space to enjoy our meal. The only slight awkward moment we encountered, was when I ordered my steak well done and he insisted that I get it at least medium well. I actually prefer my steak a nice medium rare, but perhaps there might be reason why someone would order their steak completely cooked. ;) No big deal, just a little food for thought.

If you have never been to the Westin Lake Las Vegas, I would highly recommend it on your next trip to Vegas. And if you do stay here, Marssa is the place to dine. We came here expecting to enjoy the beauty and peacefulness of Lake Las Vegas, and we were treated to a pretty excellent meal. Thanks Marssa."}
{"text":"Great sushi and seafood,  drinks,  great service.  We're love the Tiger roll. Grief rice is great too."}
{"text":"I'm a traditional sushi/sashimi kind of guy and I stay away from any sushi place that also sells steak, fusion food and other non-sushi. But because of Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title (if true), I decided to try Marssa. 
I should have stayed with my instincts and stayed away.

1st - Their sashimi plate is mediocre at best. For $70, I would have expected fancier fish, than the boring usual maguro, shake, tai, shiro maguro, etc... No fish was cured so it was very chewy - especially the tai and the shake. No uni, no bass, no spanish mackerel, not even regular mackerel. I was told that there was no toro, which i understand. Toro is seasonal and it is not the season this time. 

2nd - For $70 sashimi plate and Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title, I should have been served fresh ground wasabi. When asked for it, I was basically treated like \"it is fresh ground wasabi\" pointing at the powder based wasabi. I had to re-itterate and tell the waiter to tell the sushi chef for fresh wasabi. He did comply and came back with fresh ground wasabi. Wasabi makes all the difference.

3rd - Kids plate is a joke. If you have 7 or 8 year olds, better get 2 kids plates for each kid to fill them up, which is equivalent to an adult plate price.

4th - Sushi is Ok. However, for someone with Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title, when I ordered the amaebi, they should have also brought out the deep fried shrimp head. 

Conclusion - If you are into rolls, this place is OK, although very very pricey. I am not a fan of chain sushi restaurants like Nobu or Sushi Roku because of the impersonal fish selection. However those places are much much better than Marssa. If you are a sushi connoisseur, stay away. This place is awfull."}
{"text":"I am thinking this is Vegas' best kept secret.  I know it's really in Henderson at the Westin at Lake Las Las Vegas, but you really need to try this restaurant.  The menu has a section where couples can try 3 selections and we chose the Omakase which was amazing.  From the beginning to the end we loved everything about it, the soup was very good, sashimi and sushi plus the presentation were very nice.  Then the finale was the steak, our choice was medium which was very juicy and the sauce to dip was so good.  We have eaten steak all over town and this one is now one our top selections now.  The chef sent over a surprise at the end to finish our meal.  Ask for Allison for your server, she is so nice and explains everything on the menu.  Get a window seat to view the lake.  Hopefully you don't get a table next to you with kids that scream and don't know how to behave in a restaurant I would only hope that the host would keep couples separate from families with kids."}
{"text":"Consistently a great place to have a drink at the bar, enjoy a small dish before dinner"}
{"text":"Always had a great time eating @ the sushi bar @ Marssa. Tasty, beautiful plating, and great service. Master sushi chef Fuji..the only master chef in Las Vegas. Kaz and Martin, the other awesome sushi chefs = 0)"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for sushi. I have to say the uni was the best. Excellent offerings from the sushi department, the grill...Not so much. We ordered the Omakase dinner which included wagyu strip. I don't think so....
I've had better steak at chain steakhouses.
The interior leaves much to be desired, very disappointing.
There was nothing that went above and beyond and this was a $250 bill for two. Make the drive into the city for something better or just stick with sushi."}
{"text":"The sashimi quality is quite good.   Hamachi kama is delicious.  Desert are ok. We tried banana tempura and mochi ice cream.  Easy to make reservations.   Located on the lobby level o's the westin lake hotel.  Highly recommended the salmon skin hand roll!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi bar offers 15 different types of sake and we enjoyed a couple of varieties.  One filtered and one that was not filtered.  Both were excellent. Hands down the best sushi and sashimi  I have ever had.  Enjoyed the salmon and the tuna sashimi.  Eel roll was excellent as well as the tiger roll."}
{"text":"Marssa Marssa Marssa... our evening started off at Marssa a little questionable but ended strong. First when we showed up at Marssa, without a reservation, we weren't greeted or even acknowledged at the door when we walked in. There was no one at the hostess station and servers looked at us waiting but went about their business without acknowledging us or saying anything. It was actually several minutes before the hostess showed up. Since we didn't have a reservation she put us on a waiting \"list\" (which amounted to a piece of scratch paper) and told us it would be about a 20 minute wait and they would call us when our table was ready... but we counted no fewer than 8 open tabes .  We went up to bar to have a drink while we waited... and waited... and waited.  No call and 45 minutes later we went back to ask what was going on and got seated right away.  By the way, most of the same 8 tables were still open. When we asked why we didn't get a call about our table, we got a shrug like she had never seen us before.  Come on... really?!

Now the food on the other hand was fantastic. The spicy Miso soup was a generous portion of hot, spicy deliciousness.  The Combination Fried Rice was also really good.  But the sushi was the star of the show... wow!  And with the ginger presented in a cup of smoking blue dry ice, what a great visually creative surprise. We had a great meal and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really lovely. We had a great meal on happy hour, which still ended up being rather pricey @ $100 for two people. The food, however, was delicious and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Under the new management, this is a truly a 5-Diamond restaurant -- beautiful setting, personal attention (including attention to dietary restrictions and allergies), and delicious delicacies that are not available anywhere else in Las Vegas.  

This restaurant makes for a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars however we had to wait 40 minutes to get our food and the place was not busy . The waitress would disappear for 10- fifteen minutes at a time. When we finally received our food , it was excellent... Filet mignon,seafood miso soup, spicy scallop roll and topped with cheesecake. All was perfectly cooked and mouth watering!!!!! Very Pricey as the bill was 100.00.   For that price service should have been superb!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great venue.  The views from the hotel over Lake Las Vegas are amazing.    

Great presentation, I had the Tiger Roll. Shrimp, tempura snow crab, avocado, spicy tuna, eel sauce.  Outstanding!   

Great service and overall experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to this restaurant on our last night of our weeklong wedding anniversary vacay at the Westin in Lake Las Vegas.

Craig was our waiter and he was excellent and very knowledgeable about the menu items. 

We decided to go with \"The Marssa Experience\" since we were not totally hungry yet wanted to try a little bit of everything. Boy, did we make the right choice! Best bang for your buck-It's a five course meal including dessert at the end. Everything was fresh, unique, and fantastic.

Any bad reviews on here are from people who don't know a thing about sushi or fake reviews from competitors, yeah I said it.

5 star establishment, hands down."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Thursday night and everything was good. I've had better filet mignon but that's not to say that Marssa's mignon wasn't good because it was and I ate every piece. The pretty edible flowers on top of my mashed potatoes was a nice and elegant touch. 
However, the sushi is the main reason you want to come here. It is so fresh and so delicious. The tuna was so fresh and literally melted in my mouth. 

The food was good but I would come here for what they specialize in next time...THE SUSHI!

I will definitely be back especially since they are literally a minute from my house."}
{"text":"Thanks to storm Cindy in New Orleans ..my husband and I decided to take a staycation at the Westin Hotel in Lake Las Vegas. We usually visit good restaurants and do positive reviews for locals and non locals in the greater Nevada area.
The first impression of the restaurant was  breath taking. You are able to see the grand lake side view while eating. 
We ordered the Salmon w steam Broccoli, shrimp tampora roll, Asian salad, and tampora roll. It was absolutely amazing and fresh. It taste as if they had just caught the Salmon fresh. Everything melts in your mouth here.
Our Host Sid, by far deserved way more then a 15$ tip... he helped us pick meals, appetizers and sampled the sparkling sake on our anniversary. As a native local, I adore the services here and will be back. 
Be sure to ask for Sid.... tell him Glowing Star Media sent ya..."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Marssa for her birthday and we had the omakase.  It was one of the best meals we have had, anywhere, and I would say without hesitation that Marssa stands up to Morimoto in Philadelphia, which is one of my favorites.  Service was excellent, and Chef Kaz's creations were amazing. The chef used superior quality ingredients along with superior techniques on each course. The sushi courses were superb, ultra-fresh, and the fish was the star.  The cooked dishes were perfect, and the combination of both cold and cooked dishes over the course of the evening demonstrated Chef's skill and desire to present a memorable and first quality experience.  I would very highly recommend a trip to Lake Las Vegas just to try this restaurant--and then just go back again and again."}
{"text":"The food was great but why is it that these fancy restaurants always serve tiny portions? I'm not asking for a buffet, I just want to get my money's worth."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 2 year wedding anniversary. The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. 

The sake was incredible as well, even if it was the house selection. Although there is a mixture of Japanese and New American on the menu, the sushi is something special.

I hear reports Chef Fuji has left. I hope this isn't true!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal! They always go above and beyond and add the extra touches to the dining experience. Both times I have been here they have been consistent on going above and beyond. The steak and sushi are AMAZING! Highly highly recommend and our server, Alison, was one of the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, attentive service, great food and presentation.  I ordered from happy hour menu- miso soup, Marssa salad (amazing), California roll (with toasted sesame), and halibut with pickled lemongrass.  Wife had salmon cooked in a banana leaf and spicy edamame.  The manager offered wine glasses and toast for our anniversary but since we don't drink alcohol, they instead gave complimentary dessert to celebrate.  Chocolate lava cake and mango cheesecake with berries.  Wonderful experience start to finish.  Even the guy holding the door as we exited wished us a happy anniversary.  Thank you Marssa!"}
{"text":"It's been a little over 2 years since we've been here before that we have been coming a few times a year for over 10 years and let me tell you the consistency of quality and taste has not changed. I'm not a chef nor worked in the food industry but what I do know is consistency for that many years with hotel changeovers is very challenging but they've found the answer. Thank you for fantastic sushi, steak and service that was on point. And tip if they have uni order it you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, had crunchy eel roll and unagi sushi. Very good. Finished off with lava cake that took forever to get and was dry. All in all very good"}
{"text":"We've been here before & food is always great but didn't give any bread & butter to start with.  For the price of the food, one would think that some bread would be provided. Especially because the food takes a while to come."}
{"text":"Menu is not extensive.....there was nothing horrible or amazing about our meal. I'd say average. Service was great."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant  anywhere!  Drew has always served us and taken the best care of us! The fish is always fresh and so good. The chef takes special requests and his presentation is always very beautiful.  On several occasions my husband has held business dinners with numerous coworkers here and has had the same level of service and quality. We would never miss dining here!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but our server said some \"interesting\" things that were rather inappropriate.  Wish I knew when last call was since we were planning to order more but were told the kitchen was closed.  It closes at 10 and we tried to order more at 10:05.  They apologized but it was the first time I heard \"no\" in the Vegas area when we were trying to spend more money.  We would go back without a doubt because the food is superb, but hope to have a different server since it tainted our experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic. That's the only way to describe it. Medium fatty tuna was the best sushi I've ever had. And our server, Danny was not only friendly but very knowledgeable about the menu.  Hidden gem for sure. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do .....do NOT order the sushi. The food presentation is magnificent. Relaxing beautiful atmosphere. The waiter is beyond wonderful. The restaurant is nice and clean. Plates are unique and what beautiful eating utensils. However, the sushi is the same grade as those at \"all you can eat\" buffet. I ordered the chef's sushi entre special and the fish were cold and hard like those at the low grade buffet. Their miso soups were quite tasty though. Fried rice had gigantic egg pieces. I would not go back again. It just feel like the chef could have been one of those worked at Chipotle fast foods."}
{"text":"Driving that far away from the strip, I knew it was going to be good. We had the Tropical, soft shell crab and eel roll. Delicious!!! The Tropical roll was the perfect blend of fresh salmon and the mango that was fun to eat. The soft shell crab melts in your mouth and the crunchy eel was done to perfection."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for Valentine's Day since my boyfriend saw that the sushi chef was on Dinner Impossible on the Food Network. They had a special V-day Menu which we decided to order from. The first course was the Tuna Cocktail, this was slightly seared tuna with a spicy BBQ sauce and cucumbers. The Tuna Cocktail was good so when the second course came out, I had the Lobster Miso soup and the BF had the Hot and Sour Soup...it was a disappointment. The Lobster was so overcooked that it was rubbery and hard to even swallow, the Hot and Sour Soup was overly spicy and nothing special. The third course included the New Zealand Lamb Chops which had a Coffee Mole Sauce and Butternut Squash or the Aburi Yellowtail. The Mole Sauce overpowered the Lamb Chops, but the Yellowtail was surprisingly delish. For the main course we decided to order the Sushi for two. It came with Tuna Sashimi,  Toro, Salmon, Kobe Nigri Sushi, Tiger Roll, Crunchy Roll and Tropicana Roll.  All the rolls were half rolls (about 4 pieces each) and the nigri was nothing special. For dessert, they provided a chocolate type wafer dessert with a rasberry puree...I didn't care for it very much but the BF thought it was ok. Overall, we were a bit disappointed by the fact that this was supposed to be the only Master Sushi Chef in Las Vegas, but the quality of the food was mediocre. Ending on a positive note, I do definitely recommend the Marssa Martini!"}
{"text":"Definately one of our top 5 dining experiences.
  
We were greeted very friendly and promptly seated this Thursday evening.  We started with two   Lemon/Sage Martini's which were out of this world.

We decided to go for the fixed price menu (Omakase) $160.00 and were not disappointed.  It started with a hot steaming bowl of Miso soup that was full of jumbo shrimps and crab.  It was 10/10 and the best I have ever tasted.  The next course was Honey Walnut Shrimp and Seared Scallops.  The Tempura Shrimp was done in a delicious honey mustard sauce.  The scallops had fresh ginger and served with a great sauce with some micro greens.

Next course was Seared Tuna with crispy onion and Salmon Carpaccio with raw onion and capers both in their own tangy sauces.  10/10

After that we had a selection of the Chef's Nigiri an the presentation was beautiful with ginger on dry ice.  They served the Nigiri with an awesome smoked soy sauce. 

The main entree was a perfectly prepared piece of beef with Wasabi infused mashed potatoes and Wok Vegetables.  The steak and the mashed were 10/10.... however.... the vegetables were pretty disappointing.  They were presented poorly in a dollar store soup bowl, oily, bland and a hodge podge of veggies.  I would suggest you stay away from this side dish.

We had to skip dessert.... too stuffed.

I recommend that when you are in the Las Vegas area that you venture out to The Westin at Lake Las Vegas and try this restaurant.

The ambiance is great, with stunning lake views.

Our server was Daniel and he was excellent and attentive.  Our bill came to $211.00 and we were extremely satisfied (vegetables not withstanding)"}
{"text":"As a Concert Pianist I've had the blessed opportunity to experience some great Chefs and food from Europe to the USA, and Chef Kazukj, and the amazing staff, such as Sid my waiter, it's all above and beyond the bar of exquisite food and hospitality."}
{"text":"I had the spicy edamame and the vegetarian (vegan) fried rice. I wanted to try the other vegetarian items on the menu but they are closed on Sunday. Maybe next trip to Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"WOW!! This was our 2nd time at the Lake Las Vegas Westin & we were blown away by the incredible SUSHI!! Marssa is a must!!  It's AMAZING!!  The food and service and staff were superb.. We couldn't have asked for better quality Sushi and service.. 

Allison our server, was super knowledgable & treated us like royalty.. She is a keeper! :) 
Her smile & professionalism was truly appreciated & we can't wait to visit Marssa again!"}
{"text":"Please read through several reviews before making a determination on this place. You will notice several odd themes within many of the reviews. They have odd spacing, several exclamation points (also oddly placed), specific prices of food mentioned, odd capitalization, etc...We went with a groupon, very much looking forward to it, and it was completely gross.  The taste of the food was really fishy.  I had to stop eating the food and just let the server take it back.  The presentation was okay and are service was okay enough but they were young and basically uninformed.  I would never return."}
{"text":"This restaurant, located at the Westin Hotel in Lake Las Vegas, serves very high quality sushi and an assortment of premium Hawaiian fusion cuisine. The service is good and attentive. I gave them only 4 stars instead of 5 primarily because you can get comparable type cuisine and quality at other establishments in Las Vegas Valley at lower prices."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to have driven 30 min only to find they are closed for a private group when there is only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars because our service was great and the appetizer was good. The food (including the sushi) was a letdown. Our app was the spicy edamame and it was awesome. I was happy with it because I learned something that I could easily make at home. The rest of the meal wasn't very exciting though. We ordered two sushi rolls-the tiger roll and crunchy eel. The tiger roll wasn't very spicy and the tuna on top was very mushy. The crunchy eel roll had a sad layer of \"crunch\" on the outside. I am used to crunchy rolls being covered with crunchy fried tempura, but this was just a deep fried roll. The eel also had a off taste-kind of like old fish. I have had eel plenty of times at our local sushi joint it is always tasted smoky and good, but this eel was too fishy and if there was an excess amount on the roll, it would have been unpleasant. Our entrees weren't great either. I had the seafood katayakisoba. I really like cioppino-an Italian fish stew, so I thought that this would be similar-at least that is how the server described it. The problem was that the dish had too many elements to make it enjoyable. The broth wasn't tasty. It didn't have the right amount of savor. It was slightly sweet and it didn't do anything to bring the many elements of the dish together. Also, the pieces of vegetables were too big to eat and were still too raw. I had to cut them up and let them soak before I could eat them. The fish all needed salt and the fried noodles tasted like pizza crust. It was so weird! Finally my wife's dish was the opakapaka lau lau. It comes to the table wrapped up in a banana leaf, reminiscent of steamed fish that we have had in Hawaii, but isn't actually baked in the leaf. The problem here was again the seasoning of the dish. The fish just didn't have nearly enough flavor. The potatoes that were served underneath the fish were bland. We didn't taste any of the coconut or ginger elements that are mentioned on the menu. The only thing that was good about was the banana chutney....the problem here was that there wasn't enough of it to be enjoyed with each bite of the fish. It needed about four times the amount that was served with it. My biggest gripe was the price of everything. Fish isn't cheap and this is an upscale restaurant, but our total was around $150 with a tip. No drinks or dessert and a $5 appetizer. It was a ripoff, and I wouldn't go back. The best thing that came of it was that now I know how to make spicy edamame and to skip the long drive from Summerlin to Lake Las Vegas in search of great fusion cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's and was expecting to be wowed.  Presentation, yes.  Taste, I have had better for sushi, price, oooh kind of up there.  

The one dish that I most enjoyed was actually not sushi, it was the duck.  I like plain sushi, so the fusion ones I tried was a bit hard for me to enjoy...Just what I prefer.   Beautiful atmosphere, fantastic service too.  

If I do make the drive out here, I probably will try other dishes...Def want to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I guess the reviews do not lie! This place is amazing! We ordered the salmon/tuna mango roll and it was great. Their ingredients, specially their fish was fresh and tasty! For our main entree we ordered the filet mignon and the duck. We couldn't decide which one was better as they were both cooked to perfection. They both had the same sauce reduction which complemented the food to perfection. There is really nothing wrong I can say about this place, great atmosphere, good customer
 service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location, atmosphere is good. 
Had some sushi that was lovely, only been once"}
{"text":"This place truly is a hidden gem, as described in previous review.  Had one of the best meals I have had in Las Vegas.  Was surprised at how nice the Lowes Hotel at Lake Las Vegas is. The restaurant has a beautiful lake view.  This place is real serious and reasonably priced for such a high quality meal.  The Opacapaca Lau Lau was exceptional hands down one of the best cooked fish dishes I have ever had.  The Kobe beef tartar with truffle oil was the best tartar I have ever had.  The sushi was all very fresh and high quality.  The deserts were also exceptional the Pumpkin Tiramisu and tempura bananas were unreal.  We spent about $100 a piece but it's easily possible to go and have a great meal for $60-75.  

My one complaint is the raw fish selection is fairly limited. I figured a master sushi chef would stock a wider variety of fish.  All the fish was of extremely high quality, I just wish the selection was larger. 

Basically what I am saying is this place is worth the drive and a must try.


*The hotel is now called The Westin Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour 5:30-6:30. Fill up on the medium fatty tuna. It's pretty good. I also enjoyed the salmon carpaccio. Skip the California Roll unless you ask for no sesame seeds. It's overkill with the sesame seeds. And definitely get the spicy edamame."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Westin for a little staycation and decided to splurge for dinner. I can say it was well worth it. The sushi was out of this world. Just melted in your mouth. 
The Chilean sea bass Hawaiian style was some of the best fish I've ever had. Not only was the food fantastic but the presentation and service was top notch. 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"the food here is fantastic! 

Really well menu planning and excellent execution!!


But that isn't what sets this place apart 

From other fine dining restaurants.. 

It's the excellent service!  When you come here... 

Ask for Drew! He's the man! 



If you're already here.. Don't order anything.. 

Ask the server to create the experience for you.. And 

He will work with the sushi chef to create something 

Wonderful for you.. 


On the hot food side.. 

The lamb is amazing! Order it med-rare if you don't like

Really dry meat! 

Try everything!! 

There isn't anything that isn't good here.. 


Then pay for it! It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service.   The Hawaiian style prepared fish was incredible with fresh banana chutney, coconut milk, lemongrass and Yukon potatoes.  The steak filet surpassed even Flemings and Ruth's Chris.    Highly recommended.   Our waiter was Sid and suggested the most wonderful food selections.   Very knowledgable and accommodating.   Thank you for a wonderful evening.  We look forward to another dinner soon"}
{"text":"We went back there last weekend for our anniversary getaway.

This time we had Allison. She was a pleasure to have wait on us. 
She was very friendly and suggested a great Sake which we had two bottles. 

She was very conscious of the wife's dietary challenges and everything went perfect. 

I started with the Uni which was so fresh it was some of the best I have ever had. She had the spicy tuna roll which was great too. She had the spicy sashimi salad for dinner which she seemed to enjoy and I had the spicy wok filet which was delicious, flavorful and had plenty of spice!

For dessert she got us a complimentary mango cheesecake which was a great touch.

Thank you  Allison for a great experience!"}
{"text":"We started at Marssa with the Bento Box.  This appetizer was a 3-4 (see below).  BUT, the rest of the meal, and the service, and the overall ambiance of the place, brought the rating up to 5 stars.  The rest of the evening was that good.  It was fantastic.  Even though we never ate here when Chef Fuji was here, we did not find the main courses lacking.  I can't wait to return.  

Drew was our server, and he was perfect the entire night.  Refills both from the bar and with our water were very quick.  He had great recommendations and did not try to upsell us at all.  I was so pleased I told the manager.  We'll be sure to ask for him next time we are at Marssa.

As noted above, we had the Bento Box appetizer, and it didn't knock our socks off.  It contains 4 items:  honey walnut shrimp, an edamame dumpling, lobster cakes with crab/cucumber salad, and duck confit spring roll.  The dumpling was fine, I enjoyed the broth it was in about as much as the dumpling itself, if not more.  The lobster cakes were solid, but I could have used more of the sauce.  The cakes were underseasoned.  I didn't care for the walnut honey shrimp.  While it was cooked very well, the honey glaze did nothing for me, it was bland.  I liked the duck confit spring roll, but without the accompany sesame sauce.  I liked that you can try lots of things, but more than one dish missed.  So, the appetizer left us a little worried about the rest of the meal.

Our fears were unfounded.  I had the Marssa, a 9 piece chef's tasting platter that included both hot and cold dishes.  The winners were the Cajun albacore tuna, the A5 wagyu beef, the mackerel, and the shrimp ceviche.  The shrimp was so fresh, the body/head were moving a little on the plate.  I've never seen anything like it.  It was not off putting at all.  You are clearly at the mercy of the chef, and at $48 it's not cheap, but I certainly felt well taken care of.  It was a fantastic meal.

The wife had the seafood katayakisoba.  This is crispy noodles with broth and many types of seafood:  calamari, scallops, crab, shrimp.  It also has veggies and mushrooms.  This was a massive dish, and again, it was fantastic.  The seafood was cooked perfectly, very tender.  The noodles were crispy at the top, and when you got more into the dish, they soaked up some of the broth.  Very flavorful.  This is a definite repeat.

For dessert, we tried the pear tart with cinnamon sorbet.  It was very good, the pear took on an almost apple like quality.  This was a large dessert, easily shareable and well worth the money.  

Overall, we found both the raw and cooked dishes to be executed very very well.  It was a pleasant evening in a great setting with excellent service.  You can't ask for much more than that.  It may be a long haul for most in the Valley, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week has really proven its worth and shown me two great restaurants that I probably would have never experienced before.

I almost want to keep this place to myself, but I have to talk about it because it really was that good!

Marssa is located in the Loews Las Vegas Resort which is further out than the MonteLago Village of Lake Las Vegas.  We thought we had missed the hotel since we were driving along for awhile.

Loews Las Vegas is a hidden gem of a resort and I'm glad we found ourselves there.  

Their Restaurant Week menu offered you a choice among two starters, two entrees, and two desserts.  Luckily, the Big F and I agree on one really important thing, and that's food.  We easily decided to try the whole menu.  Just as we were about to put in our order, our waiter came by and told us they were out of hamachi.  That definitely put a damper on things and we looked over what we could substitute with hamachi.  As we perused over all the different rolls and sushi, the waiter came back and said they found more!  Yay!  

Service continued being a little quirky when steak knives soon appeared and an entrée consisting of beef arrived in front of me.  When a second steak showed up in front of the Big F, we knew something was wrong.  We motioned to a waiter (not our original one), and told him we didn't think these were our entrees.  Our waiter swiftly took them away (as they were $100 pieces of steak)!  Then the Big F noticed some discussion going on at a nearby table and had a feeling that they received our starters.  Indeed, that is what happened!  All was sorted out and we finally got our meal! 

Starters, choice of:

* Sashimi Trio \"cajun seared albacore, garlic ponzu sauce; togarashi seared tuna yuzu miso sauce; and yellowtail asian pico del gallo\" - Two pieces of sashimi each and what makes this fish different is their unique and complementing sauces.  They had us scooping up all the sauce we could!

or

* Sushi Sampler \"4 pieces hamachi verde: (yellowtail, scallions, Thai chilis topped with cilantro, and thinly sliced limes) and 2 pieces temari scallop (slices of tuna around spicy sea scallops with wasabi flying fish roe and wasabi aioli).\" - The hamachi verde is a refreshing sushi roll with the lime slices, but it's the temari scallop roll that was the real winner.  We really enjoyed the scallop and wasabi aioli, it had us wanting more!

Entrees, choice of:

* Miso Braised Kobe Short Rib \"shiitake mushrooms, grilled asparagus, crisp maui onions\" - One of their most popular dishes, and you can easily see why.  The morsels of meat were gently braised and quite delicious.  The buttery mashed potatoes were just fattening and oh-so good!  A heavy dish indeed!

or 

* Opakapaka Lau Lau \"coconut ginger cream, kobocha squash and banana chutney.\" - Beautifully presented where they 'release' the banana leaves to showcase the hidden secrets that lay within.  I'm not one for cooked fish, but this was extraordinary.  Not dry at all, and the sweetness from the banana chutney adds a completely new dimension to it.  I would go back and order this again for sure!

Desserts, choice of:

* Chocolate Lava Cake - A molten center with lovely sauces and fresh berries that come with it.

 or 

*Asian Pear Tart - Oh my gawd delicious.  So good that it's not worth sharing.  The tart is flaky and light, and the asian pears are sweet and just perfect.  And the sauces that come with it only add to the happy hum in your mouth.  Worth driving out this way just for a slice of heaven.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  You probably saw me licking the plate!

Our waiter forgot that we ordered the sake flight, a sampling of four sakes ($19).  And when we told him midway through our meal that he could just forget about it, he decided instead to give it to us complimentary!  The four samples included \"shirakaberuga junmai, dewazakura \"oka\", hoyo \"fair maiden\", and creme de sake.\"  

We did notice that it was hard to find our waiter and it looked understaffed.  When we had a chance to chat with the waiter later on, he did confirm that it was understaffed that night, which definitely explains the mix-up with all the food.

Despite all the weird service, I'd give Marssa a 4.5.  (I'm sure it would be a solid 5 during our return visit.  We're told we have to try their Dinner for Two Sushi Platters created by Master Sushi Chef Osama \"Fuji\" Fujita!)  Master Fuji was actually on hand when we left so we got to say hi too!  With him being the ONLY master sushi chef in Nevada, how can you resist not sitting in front of him?

But if we don't go for sushi, I'd definitely return for their other entrees instead.  This is one of my top choices for a nice date restaurant!

(And you know pics are posted of this fabulous dinner!)

Update! 12/08 - Returned for another fabulous visit.  This time we sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed wonderful food and fabulous service."}
{"text":"Limited Menu but GREAT Sushi!!  We tried Chef Fuji's Hamachi (Tuna) Carpaccio Cocktail and the sauce was so delicious that we asked to keep it for dipping later. The presentation was also nice with dry ice smoking from under a martini like glass.  We then ordered the Tiger Roll, Tropical Salmon Roll and the Fried Rice....all which were outstanding.  The sushi rolls were not a lot of rice and mostly the filling and they were rolled tightly so that when you dipped in the soy sauce, it did not fall apart.  Very good and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner

{"text":"Incredible sushi and even better service! Highly recommend this place. The sea bass did not disappoint and cocktails were top of the line!"}
{"text":"Wow.. can't believe I haven't written this review yet. Went here for anniversary dinner in August and it was awesome. With excellent service and food, Marssa is far and away your best option for a nice dinner at Lake Las Vegas. Since we ate at Marssa we have had short rib at several other restaurants and have yet to find one that is as delicious as Marssa. Cooked perfectly and with a TON of flavor, I highly recommend this dish.

Definitely a must when visiting Lake Las Vegas and I look forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. This was my choice for Valentines Day diner. 
This is how you know you had a good diner,...When there isn't one thing you didn't enjoy and everything you tried was really delicious. When it comes to sushi sometimes it's hard to have your taste buds surprised in a good way- this place did just that.
The service was what I wish every place to be like! Our sushi came out pretty fast. Our waitress, Natasha was really nice. When we asked what she liked best she didn't just say the most expensive items she mentioned a few different choices. Also every plate we ordered she knew what it was and explained the dish to us  when she brought it out! 

Chef Fuji offers sushi \"classes\" (sushi and sake sessions). Our dinner orders where so beautiful we're defiantly considering taking a class, I'm sure we'd learn a thing or two! I was reading online that chef Fuji is the only master sushi chef in all of Nevada (this may or may not be true).

One fact is that all of our fish was fresh, beautifully prepared, and delicious! The kobe beef short ribs where very savory. Our favorite item was the Tropical Salmon Sushi Roll: tuna, avocado, rolled with salmon, sliced mango, and a squeeze of lemon. The salmon and mango blended in both taste and texture so well, it was a really refreshing sushi roll. 

We ordered a sake sampler (which was all cold sakes) my favorite was the Shirakabegura Tokubetsu Junmai. 

If you come here please order the Hamachi/ Yellow Tail that was also one of our favorites. 

In the pictures you'll see we also got the Bento Box- crispy lobster, kobe satay, edamame dumplings, and chicken yahatamaki. And we got The \"Marssa\" with all soy paper, which is chef Fuji's specialty sushi and sashimi. It was so nice getting to try all these different bites, and when our waitress Natasha brought it out she knew everything that was in each of his specialties so again that made it more fun to try. 

Last but not least we ordered ice cream and the chocolate lava for desert. Our dinner came with amuse-gueule of seared hamachi and at the end with chocolate lollipops. 

We can't wait for patio dining to open up- the view of the lake is nice here and once the patio opens up it'll be even nicer. Lake Las Vegas is a drive if you live on the West side of town but trust me it's completely worth it and really nice break from the city! 

We'll be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I can start by saying that this restaurant really surprised us in a great way. You would never think that great food would actually come out of this place. I mean it's super far from where I live.

Let's get to the food!!! recommended from my co worker who actually works here at night and was our server we thank you drew. 

Chutoro nigiri-(medium fatty tuna) 4/5
Actually really good I kind of only wish it was garlic ponzu sauce but very fresh.

Albacore tataki-4/5-great flavor and I wanted like another 3 orders of this..lol

Kumamoto oysters 5/5 so good my favorite thing

Tuna cocktail 5/5-the display was something amazing they put some dry ice in the liquid and the cup was smoking and the tuna was delicious!

Spider roll and crunchy eel-4/5-  Really good rolls the great thing about this place is the crab they use in the rolls is snow crab.great flavor only thing I can say is I wanted more eel and soft shell crab in my rolls

Spicy edamame-3/5-not bad not the best either

Sea urchin (uni nigiri) 5/5-super fresh!

Hamachi kama-4/5 prepared really well and tasted great and the skin on the outside was crispy enough to eat stone places don't prepare this right but this was good

Salmon skin hand roll 3/5-this was probably my last favorite thing I mean don't get me wrong I ate it all and it tasted great but the bonito flakes that we're stuffed in here didn't make it awesome!I would suggest a little eel sauce and less bonito thank you

Fried banana and chocolate lava cake dessert 5/5-this dessert was amazing it was simple with this salted caramel gelato the combo was awesome

Overall this is a great place if you want to bring your significant other and just want to get away from the fast life in Las Vegas for a night and enjoy good food and feel like your in another town when you're only 30 min from the strip!"}
{"text":"Omg. The most expensive mediocre Japanese food ever. Save your money. Do not ear here. Tempura is heavy tasteless batter. Sushi is like supermarket quality. Prices are outrageous. Ambience is so so. Lake view is only good thing. Chef is not up to past results. He is gone and so is good food. Forgettable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! My husband and I are here twice during our stay-cation at the Westin. Service was phenomenal, our waiter was Daniel. He made great recommendations for food and wine pairings. 

Let's talk about the food--some of the best sushi we have had in Vegas, even compared to the celebrity restaurants downtown. We especially enjoyed the fish lau-lau style, the fish carpaccio, the filet, tiger rolls and tuna sashimi. Must try the banana tempura dessert--to die for! 

Presentation was beautiful, atmosphere was high-end but relaxing. Views of Lake Las Vegas were available from all tables in the restaurant...

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had Absolutely the best service ever in my life, starting off at this restaurant with amazing food and staff, thinking it doesn't get better than this... But it does... After having a great dinner with staff that make you feel like you're at home. The director - MIKEY!! - took the time to talk with us, get to know us, make sure we were having the best experience and that everything was up to standard (which it was, with flying colors).


After hrs being gone from the restaurant we ran into Mikey on the Hotel property (the Westin) and he continued WOWing us with complimentary S'Mores kits for everyone at the fire pits on the beautiful outdoor terrace. After the experience Mikey and his staff (thanks, Steve!) gave us I will make sure when I come back to Lake Las Vegas I will with out a doubt stay at the Westin all because of him. Thank you for making our trip!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in myself for living at Lake Las Vegas for 2+ yrs and only just discovering this hidden gem! Found this place via recommendation from the Island Sushi chef who claimed Chef Fuji at Marssa is the BEST sushi chef in Nevada....bold claim but his biography designation as the only Master Sushi Chef I would say is accurate.   

The place is pricey but you get what you pay for....romantic restaurant without being overly pretentious.  We went at night, so we didn't get to take in the full effect of the restaurant with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Lake Las Vegas.  However, the sitting area right outside the restaurant (part of the Loews hotel) has small fire pits with a cozy sitting area at night.

Onto the food, the fish and seafood is exceptional!  For appetizers we ordered Chef Fuji's Tuna Cocktail which in itself is a mini show since it comes on top of a vase of dry ice to give the impression that this poke like tuna dish is smokin'.  We also ordered the sp gunkan roll, which turned out to be a mini sushi sampler plate with spicy yellowtail, spicy tuna, creamy corn and prawn, spicy scallop, and eel with avocado wrapped in soy paper.   While the fish was fresh, I don't know if it's really worth $20...but again you pay for presentation as well...and the dish was almost too pretty to eat...almost =).  The only lack luster dish was the sakekasu salmon, which just seemed to have a miso/soy glaze paired with fingerling potatoes.  Nothing exceptional there...  We also tried the seafood curry udon which had a light Japanese coconut curry broth combined with what seemed a copious amount of squid/scallops/prawns/king crab.  The udon was cooked perfectly and the coconut curry broth was not overly sweet.  We ended the meal with pumpkin tiramisu...the coffee extract was replaced with pumpkin....the texture was amazingly light...definitely a good end to the evening.

For those not wanting to pay the price tag associated with the dinner menu, I noticed they have a happy hour Tues-Sat from 6-7pm....well worth a try if you are ever in the area.  Also Chef Fuji also holds a Sushi and Sake school in the summertime for those wanting to truly learn from the master =)"}
{"text":"Travelling north from Tucson overnight at The Westin, Lake Las Vegas. Evening meal at this restaurant proved to be a delightful experience. Food quality and service were just great. They even, from the bar, had choices of Port. One would be surprised at the amount of quality restaurants that do not stock Port. That was an aside, Enjoyed my experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Marssa is most definitely outstanding!  The BEST food I have ever had at a hotel restaurant, I will stretch and say the best restaurant I have been to period. Simply amazing appetizers, best miso ever, and the sea bass is spot on amazing also.
Now the food is perfect, but so is the presentation!! Service here matches the food, outstanding in every way... I have no connection with Marssa in any way, just here on vacation staying at the Westin Las Vegas lake. Great place to stay also!!!

Omg... I almost forgot the California roll, out of this world...period... Never have I had a California roll like this at all, crab cake....BOOM!!! Out of this world!!!

Allison, our waitress... AMAZING also!! 
I'm out of words!!!!!
Outstanding!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and high quality food.  Thoughtful flavor pairing and presentations."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go! We had the sea platter for two. The wine was amazing the service is spot on. Take the time to go out of your way and get off the strip go to lake Las Vegas. The Westin is a beautiful hotel and service is like no other"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Lake Las Vegas from California and read  The Marssa steak & sushi bar received excellent reviews. The sushi was equivalent to our favorite sushi restaurant in Maui, our waiter Daniel recommended a perfect saki to go along with our meal. The big plus is its a 3 minute drive from our place more saki please."}
{"text":"I was very happy with this place, the sushi was excellent, the curry was very nice and the bento box was very good too. Dessert could have been skipped here, not bad, just not great. Everything else was awesome though!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place based on yelp reviews and was sorely disappointed.

This restaurant can't really figure out what it is, and I don't mean in the \"fusion\" sense. It seems like a nice restaurant with cloth tablecloths and dim lights, but then they give you the cheap disposable chopsticks you get with takeout. The waitstaff is dressed formally in black collared shirts and black pants, but then their demeanor / attitude is very casual. They have a sushi bar, but serve things like california rolls and spicy tuna rolls. 

My boyfriend had the seared duck, which was flavorful, but chewy. I had the nigiri combination, which includes 8 pieces of nigiri. The nigiri / sashimi prices are incredibly high for the incredibly low quality - $9 for 2 pieces of regular ahi! It was just barely better than the sushi you can get in a box at Whole Foods. The rice also kept falling apart every time I attempted to dip it in my soy sauce. 

The cocktails are reasonably priced but they're not fantastic. 

There were children running about unsupervised in the dining room. One group of friends performed a rousing rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\" 

There aren't many choices as far as restaurants near lake las vegas go, but I definitely won't be driving out here just to eat here any time soon."}
