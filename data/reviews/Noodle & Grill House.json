{"text":"The Noodle & Grill house is an affordable little Vietnamese lunch kiosk, that sits on the +15 level atop of the ScotiaBank on the corner of 7th and 7th.  It can be accessed from the street level by taking the stairs beside the Scotiabank entrace, or you can access it via the +15 walkway.  Every lunch hour, this little place has a big lineup of happy, return customers that support ths little business.  I am one of them.  I have tried a number of things on their menu, but tend to stick to the asian buffet items or ltheir daily specials.  What tends to amuse me (in a good way) is that they use scissors to cut up their chicken and spring rolls.  I don`t mention that as a concern and from what I can see, there are no food safety issues.  But it is just mildy amusing to me to order a spring roll, and to see your server pull out a pair of scissors and cut it into four equal pieces to put on top of your noodles.  If you are looking for fast and delicious vietnamese, don`t pass by the Noodle & Grill House.  I can usually get my lunch for arouned $7 and it is consistently good.  As C.T. mentioned, this is a cash-only establishment."}
{"text":"Very good Beef Stew Noodle Soup!  For only $8.50!  The soup in Cantonese is called \"Ngau Lum Mein.\"  Although it's Vietnamese, it' has Chinese food as well.  A friend of mine recommended me to eat here and she was right; it's so good!    This little take-out place is quite popular amongst the workers in that area.  Go early and you can secure a spot in the eating area around the take-out place.    FYI - Cash only.   I'm definitely going back to try more of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Sad lunch for me.  I used to come here every once in a while if I wanted a good hot noodle soup (beef flank was particularly good).  Came here after several months away and this place has gone down the drain.  The soup still smelled delicious, but the broth had no flavor and was quite watery.  The noodles were inconsistent (some of them were a bit hard/dried still).  The beef didn't taste very good and the beef flank was a bit dried out.  I probably won't be back, if I want a noodle soup I'll lineup at Koya's in Banker's Hall."}
