{"text":"Chow fun is fun. Staff very helpful. Clean and reasonably priced. Fried ice cream is mmm"}
{"text":"This is a pretty unique restaurant. It is a mix of Asia and Hawaii food restaurant. This place looks very nice and clean. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We had Kalua pig with seaweed salad. it was very delicious. My son like spicy food ,so he had the flaming noodle . It was very spicy. he loves it. The calamari and malag were really good dessert . we orderd one more of each calamari and malaga to go. The smoith is fantastic.

We definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Look i'm not going to go all out and blast them. Maybe it was a bad night, it was an hour before close. I really like seeing small business succeed. I love Hawaiian food, I eat it all over the valley and go out of my way to find new joints. I even learned how to make some of my favorites. Tonight it was just bad. No flavor on just about everything. The mac salad was hard and tasted like just cold shells with no flavor at all (Mac salad IS a major part of Hawaiian). A couple other things about the place bugged me, messed up the order to begin with, no booster chairs for kids sucked, just a couple little things. I spent $35 for our meal and as a family we couldn't eat it and just threw it away and went some where else for dinner. Like I said, maybe it was a off night. I will not however be going back with so many other places to get the same food. I wish them the best and all I can really say is quality check your food all the time, if it is the cooks fault you need to catch it before it goes out, if it is just bad recipes then work it out. There are a ton of places around town you can go and see how they are doing it right. Sorry guys .. this place just isnt for me."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because we had a coupon from restaurants.com. First of all, there was only one person running the restaurant. I don't know when they usually get busy, but it was around lunch time, so I would expect it to have at least 2-3 people working: 1 as the cashier, and the others as the cooks. Secondly, the cashier had a hard time finding the coupon tab because the manager has changed the system on him. It took him like 15-20 mins to find it. I think it's the responsibility of the manager or owner to let your workers know how to work a new system. Lastly, the food wasn't that great.

Char Siu Chicken: had a little bit of taste, but it wasn't char siu chicken
Beef Broccoli: barely any flavor
Vegetarian w/ Fried Rice: most of the vegetables were overcooked
Mini egg rolls (got them free for checking in): it was mushy, and there were only a little bit of filling
Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp: burnt
Fried Tofu: it wasn't crunchy on the outside 
House salad on the side of the meals: soaked in the dressing. I think they should put the dressing in a little container, especially if it's a take out order.

Having bad service is not the worker's fault. The worker, Jaemar, tried his best to work efficiently, but he was working the cashier and cooking the food. So whenever a customer comes in, he has to stop cooking for a little bit and take the orders. I give him credit. I think the food would've tasted better if it wasn't rushed. 

Sorry, but I won't be coming back again unless I'm informed that things have improved."}
{"text":"Good food needs more customers will go again. I don't think smoothies are real fruit. Needs less oil and more choices. Would recommend if on that side of town. Woh whooo"}
{"text":"We had the short ribs and char siu chicken, the meat was pretty good, a step up from most fast food Hawaiian places out here in Vegas but, being from Hawaii nothing can compare to the real stuff"}
{"text":"Food was neither awesome nor terrible... average. Can't comment on the staff or the condition of the restaurant because I ordered through UberEATS. I personally do not believe I'll eat there again, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. The portions were descent... fried rice was pretty bland and the chicken was blehhh. My house salad was drenched in dressing, but that's how a lot of people like it- just not me."}
{"text":"Well where to begin...I usually don't take the time to leave a review, but my goodness is this place not up to par. Tisk tisk; I was actually hoping for a some good quick asian cuisine, unfortunatetly I got undercooked rice, undercooked chicken, and a seaweed salad that contained more greens than seaweed. 
I was really disappointed that the chicken seemed so undercooked ( I am hoping that it wasn't; being that I just ate this less than an hour ago.) The consistency was rubbery and chewy, it made it rather unpleasant to chew and I spit the food out because chicken isn't supposed to taste that way.
Anyways, this place isn't for me. Hope the quality improves!"}
{"text":"Positive: They honored the coupons with no hassle.  The mac salad was basic but tasty. The char siu chicken was decent, a little heavy on the 5 spice. The employees were very nice and friendly.

Negative: Everything else.  The kalbi ribs were terrible; very dry and salty. The Teri chicken tasted like they boiled chicken and then poured cheap old Teri sauce on it. The mochico wings were burnt and tasted like they were fried in old filthy oil. The garlic shrimp had the same nasty old oil flavor as the wings.  The adobo...wow. It tasted like boiled pork dipped in vinegar and cumin mixed with school lunch brown gravy. The lo mein tasted like what I imagine pig slop would taste like - greasy, super salty, mushy noodles.

Overall: Very disappointing dining experience.  I will not spend t any more money at Oh My Rice.

The unique menu is what caught my attention, decided to give them a shot.  I feel bad that the food was so unpleasant. I always want local businesses to succeed. It was definitely bad enough that I felt I should review them so others can at least make a more educated decision on where to eat. I would like to give them a second chance, but I can't justify spending any more money at the risk of getting a similar result. I can't see them last long if the food I received was up to their normal standard."}
{"text":"I placed an order here using the Yelp Eat24 app. I received a call from EAT 24 that the restaurant never confirmed the order. EAT 24 tried calling the restaurant and the owner, but no one answered. I waited until a little after the estimated delivery time just in case, but the food never arrived. I canceled and EAT 24 refunded my money. If you're very hungry, you should probably consider ordering from a restaurant that will actually bring you food."}
{"text":"First they need more people waited awhile to get your order in the cook which is also taking the orders is confused on how to add the voucher and free egg roll for check in... also they also gave my order away to someone else and have to wait for another long wait to get my REAL ORDER... haizt  this food better be good or else won't be coming again... 

Kalbi: doesn't taste like kalbi. And not even cook well

Shrimp s&p: shrimp was hardly cook and u can literally taste the FLOUR just disaster waste of time and money I'm sorry to say. 

Good thing the guy forgot about the punch card coz I won't be coming back 

----
Owner reach out and try to make my bad experience from last time offered $30 credit to try them again and I did now my orders is much better than the last time. I do appreciate the gesture."}
{"text":"This was the worst way I could have spent $60.   My fried rice was not cooked all the way.  My ribs had more fat than meat & my chicken was cooked hard.   FAIL"}
{"text":"OMG! Do not order from this stingy restaurant. I ordered calamari cost 5.99. When i received my order They gave me only 5 pieces of small calamari and not even crispy. Taste old and recooked!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and we cant say enough about the gentleman who served us, he was great! We came in towards closing and he still took extra time to provide top notch service. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident on 2/22.
Ordered a build my own w lots mein. 
It was sooo good! Best I've had in Vegas. Had a reddish tint, assumed it had a red wine vinegar maybe..
Went bk next day, ordered same thing. It was soo bad! No flavor,no color, no seasoning, ice cold & ready in mins. Like it was sitting for hrs. My son said, different cook. And yes, it was different workers. 
Really strange how same food at same rest could taste so different."}
{"text":"Hawaiian, Japanese, and Filipino, all on one menu- you can DIY your own fried rice or noodle dish, or grab an entree with kalbi, mochiko chicken, or abobo. We came in super hungry and tried a little bit of everything.

The mochiko wings were our favorite item, but they didn't really resemble mochiko chicken I've had elsewhere. Good flavor though, til we got to the last couple pieces that were undercooked and pink inside. 
I tried the Oh My Flaming Noodle- it is so spicy it should come with a warning! Definitely pair this with the mac salad or seaweed to help cool down between bites. My guy made his own rice dish and really enjoyed it. He also had one of their smoothies with boba, which was freshly made with fruit and juice. I do wish they'd marinate their boba though.
The manager came out to check on us and delivered a dessert for us to try, on the house- I didn't catch the name, but it's a Filipino rice pudding with ice cream? Interesting, not something I've had before.

Service was really friendly and the food came out quick. I'd keep this in mind for a takeout spot, particularly if you have picky eaters or vegetarians, as the DIY dishes can easily accommodate specifications. 

TIP: Snag the Yelp deal ($12 for $20) before you go, and check in for 3 free mini egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Great service from Jearmar at the register and got food fast. Food is tasty- I got vegetarian option noodles and a spam musubi. Lots of veggies in my meal and enough food I shared it!"}
{"text":"I never send food back but I had to say something when there were no noodles in my vegetarian chow fun. The worker who didn't prepare my order apologized for the inconvenience and then returned my food in two boxes: the original container of veggies and tofu and a side of clumped together chow fun noodles broken into small pieces. I'd ordered the same dish a little over a month ago and thought I'd found my favorite chow fun so close to home, but this was not it. 

The owner walked in to the restaurant a few minutes later and I requested that he recook the dish for me. I was really hungry so I had started eating the tofu and veggies when he asked to take the food back to the kitchen, and subsequently mixed the same veggies with fresh noodles in his wok. I thought this was a poor judgment call considering the first cook had been so careless. It was edible, but definitely didn't compare with the tasty chow fun I ate here soon after their grand opening. I ordered a smoothie that only listed orange and pineapple on the menu but also included an unexpected wild berry smoothie base. I really like the veggie egg rolls, but I'm unlikely to return after this awkward experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this place, very disappointed. We ordered delivery, which was on time. But the food was soooooo dry and old! My husband took the food back and guess what... they were closed! It's going to take for us to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is okay. We ordered the char siu chicken entree, mochiko chicken entree, 2 musubis, side calamari and fried tofu, and about 4 cooked to order plates. I got the shrimp mix with chow fun which didn't sit well with me. The chow fun came out too oily. The shrimp/adobo was not a good combination. My family enjoyed the entrees and the fried rice they ordered. The calamari was a bit pricey for the amount we paid for. We would probably eat here again, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed eating at this place! I'm not one to even usually write reviews, but I hate to waste my money as well."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! Love the service food was great ..  the cook with the curly hair he  was absolutely knowledgeable about the food that's being prepared . I'm into food and it's a plus to see people who work in the food industry actually care about there job. I give this place 5 starts 5 star service."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot from here. I love their special garlic shrimp, calamari, and tofu. Everytime we pass by this place I need to buy something even I am not hungry. Employess are very friendly and if you do not understand the menu because of the food combinations to cook for you they will explain it to you. I got a free taste of the chicken and when I come back I will order that. Try it it is hawaiian asian fusion."}
{"text":"The service was good, the guys there were nice and fast, but the food was so bland. There was no taste to anything. I had the kalua pork and my bf had the adobo pork. The rice was also way undercooked. Not very impressed or happy"}
{"text":"I so wanted tbis place to be great, or at least good. They were not. Unfortunately they were out of:
Boba
3 kinds of smoothies
Fried ice cream

The fried rice was bland and under cooked. We didnt recieve a receipt or our calamari. When i asked about the calamari I was advised we hadnt been charged for it. One of smoothies was totally wrong. Staff was accomidating but being out of 25% of your menu is frustrating."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had got a restaurant.Com certificate from tmobile Tuesday and picked this place out. Not bad. I really liked the seaweed salad but everything else was either dry or oily. I'm very picky with my food. On the other hand. My hubby loved it so don't get me wrong... food is good just not up to par with my taste buds."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Food is great and the service was super nice too!

Their mochiko chicken is so delicious. And the ribs too!"}
{"text":"Our first visit using a Groupon purchase coupon.   We were met by Bailey and Jaemaz, the were awesome and patient with all the questions.    We winded up ordering the pork dish that came with cabbage and they let my sister substitute the cabbage for rice.   There was a lot of meat.   The only issue was it was soooo salty that we winded up throwing it all the way.     We are going to give it one more try.    Review to follow."}
{"text":"Customer  service is incredible. Food is amazing. Check it out see what you are missing."}
{"text":"It is my second visit to this place. Very casual type of place and their menu is asian fusion- Hawaiian, Japanese, and Filipino, all on one menu. I like their Kalbi short ribs- delicious tender beef short ribs grilled to perfection with Korean BBQ sauce. It comes with rice or noodle with a choice of salad. We also tried Kalua Pig and Adobo.

I also like Mochiko chicken wings-Japan mochiko flavor or you can choose plain with sauce.

We came in yesterday and tried a lot of food.

The flavor on these dishes were very tasteful and fresh. The deep fried eggs rolls which is Spring rolls to me are crispy and are the best I have eaten.

The service were good on both times.

The price is reasonable and they offer delivery. I just wished they were located closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I think they need more staff and someone to focus on food only. The food is decent but nothing to pay full price for."}
{"text":"Ok sooooo I typically wont write bad review because I feel people never tend to share good dining experiences.......BUT I hate to say i should have stuck to my first instinct when I arrives at O My Rice in the dead center of the lunch rush and I swear I saw a tumble weed rollin by. NOT ONE CUSTOMER! Well I now know why. The fried rice was old, dry and flavorless. The veggies barely cooked. The mac salad was just the same ingredient as the fried rice except with macaroni (total disappointment). The service was BLAND! The girl who took my order didn't even know how to pronounce the items nor did she ask me if I wanted chicken or pork when I ordered my Adobe..... I guess I look like a pork kinda gal. Definitely a waste of $15. The ONLY reason I gave them 2 start is because the place was immaculate! But then again kinda hard to be dirty with no customers ......"}
{"text":"The second man working there was on his phone from the time we arrived, while we ordered, and until we left! Paying little or no attention to us. Food came with lots of discounts and coupons but NOT WORTH IT . it tasted like a TV dinner. Soggy noodles, chewy shrimp, bland tofu, super soggy egg rolls. Please, for the sake of your taste buds and your wallet. Do. Not. Go. Here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it since I wanted some hawaiian food and the Mochiko wings, fried rice and Mac salad were good. Reason why it's only getting 2 stars is because the sad excuse for Pork Adobo. It was tender but it wasn't even close to adobo.

First off the cook needs to lay off the black pepper and whatever herb he used to trash the dish. (Filipino but can't make adobo?) Second, how tf is it spicy. Really sad that this place can't make adobo which is a 3-5 ingredient dish. Fusion..more like confusion. Go read some recipe books"}
{"text":"Just to be generous on ratings, I'll give a 3 stars due to the fact the portion of chicken I received were so little as they buried it with too much rice."}
{"text":"O My Rice is a type of Asian fusion restaurant (they seem to be everywhere) that recently opened in my part of town.  Carbs carbs carbs!

This place is akin to your L&L and your Aloha Kitchen, with a mixture of hearty Asian cuisine from all over the world.  Filipino is noticeable on the menu, which is funny because not ONE Filipino in sight behind the kitchen!!  So, as such, we stayed away from the Filipino food because if it ain't better than my Mama's then it ain't worth trying.  Sorry guys.

We had a Yelp coupon that gave us I believe $20 worth of food for $12.  With that we decided it give it a go.  Wound up at O My Rice on a Friday night, it was pretty empty at the time.  Menu boards are pretty straight forward though.  Appetizers, salads, meals, noodles & rice, and desserts.  We wanted to maximize our Yelp coupon so wifey & I decided on a couple of meals and an appetizer to share.  We ordered:

*Kalbi Short Ribs ($10.99) - beef short ribs grilled with Korean BBQ sauce
*Mochiko Chicken ($7.99) - Japanese style sweet fried chicken
*Eggroll ($4.99) - 6 piece

Each meal came with your choice of fried rice or chow fun noodles & choice of house salad, mac salad, or seaweed salad.  For the Kalbi Short Ribs meal we got fried rice & mac salad, for the Mochiko Chicken meal we got the chow fun & seaweed salad.

Order didn't take very long, about 15 minutes from start to finish to be packed up to-go.  Boxes were heavy & packed well.  Quick, friendly service.  Under $20 to boot!

Once we got home, we discovered that O My Rice likes to do just that...O MY RICE!  They pack on the carbs!!  Our plate was heavy with more fried rice than meat!  A heap of mac salad!  The Kalbi Short Ribs was on the small serving side, 6-8 thin cut pieces.  Same went for the Mochiko Chicken, 6-8 pieces but with a ton of chow fun noodles and a decent size serving of seaweed salad.

The Kalbi Short Ribs were pretty standard.  Store bought marinade, nothing very special but they were BBQ'd well with nice burnt edges.  The Mochiko Chicken was much closer to a Teriyaki Chicken (it's possible they made a mistake) because there was no batter on the actual chicken itself, but the flavor was very sweet.  Wish the salad with the meals were packed in separate containers because by the time we got home, the mac salad & seaweed salad were warm and soggy from being in the same container as the hot food.  Pretty much a waste.

The eggrolls were not to my liking unfortunately - very little filling and too much of a sesame oil flavor.  They were fried OK though.

The standouts here were the CARBS!  The plain fried rice & chow fun noodles were tasty!  Must be the sauce they use or the way they are wok-cooked - really adds that Chinese 'breath of the Dragon' taste you get from cooking in a wok with high BTU.  Wifey & I really enjoyed that.

Would be back to O My Rice again if they put a larger serving of meat with the meal & they pack the salad separately.  I would probably have to have another coupon though again to venture out that way.  But it looks like our next order would be from their section of the menu where you can build your own fried rice or chow fun noodle plate.

{"text":"Not a bad place.  This place has am unusual menu.  Part Hawaiian.  Part Asian.  I liked it. The food was good, but not great.  I'll give them another shot in the future and perhaps add another star.  They also make smoothies which are pretty good.  Serving size was reasonable.  I wish they had some lunch specials.  I don't usually spend $12 on lunch.  Not all the entrees are $12 of course, but some of the ones I like are.

It's at Craig&Jones in from of the Neighborhood Walmart."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stumbled upon this gem today, and we could not have been happier. The staff was awesome, and made suggestions for us because we have never eaten here, we got the char siu chicken, and the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and mac salad. It was bomb. Super tender chicken, great flavor!!! The lady at the counter even gave us coupons and a free app while we were chillin. 

We usually go to L &L, but this was way better. 

Will most def come back"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner....I was looking forward to the bao bun and hawaiian food. They discontinued the bao bun...so sad. I was very disappointed. charsu chicken was bland and boiled.....boiled! \"Hawaiian\" garlic shrimp tasted  like flour. Spam musubi and mac salad no flavor and not mouth watering. I did get fried tofu that was somewhat tasty but no sauce at all. 

I think this place has great potential but they should know just a little more about asain hawaiian fusion. It would make a huge difference and most likely get more business. Just a few tweaks.   

The gentleman who rung our order up was nice and friendly the restaurant  is very  nice and clean."}
{"text":"The food is so salty  all I could taste was soy sauce I sliding teriyaki which is supposed to be semi sweet  never coming again just a heads up"}
{"text":"First time in cashier a little rude but he explained they just had a rush so no biggie. Takes my order didn't have pennies for change (no biggie) then made small convo. Runs fingers through hair and walks over to get a drink. Comes back to front counter and digs in Halloween candy and gets gum.  counts money in register then is called back to finish food. Gum in mouth hands not washed goes in kitchen and starts to handle food couldn't see whole kitchen but from what I could see he used tongs. Get my food and go home no soy sauce but I make it happen. Food bland shrimp over cooked but spam musubi was good. I said I would give it a second chance but after two bowel movement and stomach pain today I'm having second thoughts. I let the manager know before I left my concerns and he said he would take care of them. So maybe in a couple month."}
{"text":"If you've eaten Hawaiian food before please go elsewhere. You'll thank me. This place definitely need to invest in a Hawaiian chef"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get to try the food... first thing that was said to me when I walked in was, \"sorry it's going to be at least an hour we have 4 online orders\" I get it but I don't . There was one person in the lobby (waiting for food), then I walk in a they can't handle 6 orders? It smells good. Too bad I didn't get to try it."}
{"text":"OMR!!! Finally a create your own fried rice joint. Had lunch there the other day and the food was great. Got to pick my own chow fun noodles, protein and veggies. The place is brand new so I'll cut them some slack on minor things. I'd didn't try any of the menu items but I will be back."}
{"text":"The delivery driver was very rude, \"Is this yours, next time put your building number on you order\". The food descriptions are not all accurate. The flavor is OK, but there are plenty of better Hawaiian BBQ places in the area. I like Lulu's my self, but they didn't have delivery."}
{"text":"This food was ok, not bad, not great.  Boba and fruit smoothies were good though.  Friendly staff but they're still learning the ropes.  The resto is clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"A little pricey and greasy but all in all not bad. Free WiFi is a plus. The smoothies are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Used my free UBER EATS offer and mochiko chicken i ordered came with too much rice. Chicken no flavor to it! I guess it really showed and tasted FREE.. Sorry not to my standards of regular eatery joint in the future!"}
{"text":"This was the First & Our Last! This has to be worse experience ever at any fast food restaurant. It took 15 minutes to take our order , plus it took 50 minutes to receive our food To-Go. To make it worse, the food was horrible, ie: Beef & Broccoli with Fried Rice, it wasn't Fried Rice it was boiled rice & house salad had no flavor at all, the house salad looked like southern greens with no flavor or dressing-to make it worse they charge me $9.99 & the Meal portion was only $8.99, I asked why was I charged $9.99 and the cook said, probably was the tax, I laughed. I didn't ask for my refund because it would of taken probably another 15 minutes. My daughters  Char Siu Chicken with fried rice with house salad was the same as my the beef & broccoli, not worth the money. My Wife's Vegetarian with fried rice was horrible, looked like a pile of dog food. Our Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp 4 piece $4.99, was very burnt waste of money totally, Our fried Tofu $2.99 had no flavor and supposed to be fried, not fried tofu I don't know what it was. Lucky for me I had a $15 coupon, but if I new what i was purchasing I would of save my money. No Fault to our Cashier/Cook Jaemar, he was the only person working during the lunch hour and he was doing his best to cook the food & cashier at the same time & the food showed it. When we were there, two customers walked out and another customer wanted their money back, because they waited longer than 1 hour & the food wasn't even ready. The owner need to really focus on customer service and hire more employees to make his business work, not to just save $8.25 hour, while losing $50 to $100 hour, just doesn't add up! , Plus the food dishes need alot of work, ie. Flavor & presentation. This place needs alot of work, we won't be returning. Save your Restaurant.com purchases on the establishment. Jaemar,  you being a hard worker you definitely can get a better job."}
{"text":"I should have known better after reading the reviews. I walked in and was greeted by a lady who couldn't speak or understand english. One cook who had to run back and forth to help this lady get our order in. The food took along time and was very disappointing. The mochiko chicken was ok! The kalbi ribs had no flavor. Musubis dry, no sauce. I felt sorry for the cook who probably owns the place. Horrible food and service!"}
{"text":"1/8/17 
Adjusting my review by adding a star. The owner contacted us directly to apologize for our experience on Fridat. That's super classy; he didn't have to respond at all. Might consider giving this place another shot based on his customer service. 


1/6/17
Slowest service, terrible food. 
We tried this place because we heard it was ok. When we walked in there was 1 guy working and 1 lady in line. We ordered 4 meals and 1 smoothie. 35 minutes later we got our food. The chicken is stringy and tastes awful. He gave us mochiko chicken breast instead of wings. The Mac salad is inedible and the fried rice has a pool of oil in the bottom of the box and oil dripping from the rice. My daughter ordered a Sunrise Surprise smoothie - orange & pineapple. It came to our table purple. Not sure what types of oranges and pineapples they use here, but I've never seen purple oranges or pineapples. The server was rude and argumentative with regard to our questions. I totally understand being busy on a Friday, but no apology for our 30 minute wait, no apology for OBVIOUSLY making the wrong smoothie. 

Complete waste of a drive and our evening."}
{"text":"Terrible service and even worse quality food. We stopped in to get a smoothie, which looked delicious on the pictures. My smoothie was brown (when I ordered the Green Monster). I don't think the worker ever made a smoothie in his life, I'm not sure if he could even pour a cup of water. Never would I ever go back."}
{"text":"Ordered $50 worth of food and couldn't eat anything but the mac salad and rice.  The meats were inedible.  After tasting them (teriyaki, char siu, mochiko chicken, garlic shrimp, kalbi) I was afraid if we ate them any further we'd get sick.  It was sad but we threw it all in the trash. 

Maybe we went on a bad night when a cook was gone and someone that didn't know how to cook tried to wing it??  Idk, but with all the other options around I'll never go again and can't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food tastes great!! Not only was the food made quickly, but it is also made fresh. I had the mochiko chicken and fried rice. The fried rice was amazing! It had great taste and wasn't too dry or too wet. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. In all, this place has great fresh food. I highly recommend this place to someone who wants food that is fresh and fast. I definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I walked in at 2:30 pm and not a soul in sight. I was going to go to my Go-To place Schwarma House across the street , but decided to give this NEW place a try. I ordered the Char-Siu Chicken with Fried Rice and the Seaweed salad combo. The Chicken was tasty and so was the salad. The fried rice was some of the most bland flavorless rice Ive ever had. I had my order to go and when I got home I had to dowse my rice with Teriyaki baste and glaze to give it some flavor. They also used so much oil in cooking the bottom of my To Go container was coated in heavy oil. I might try a second time , but if it does not get much better , I doubt I will go a third time."}
{"text":"Saw them on Yelp with the coupon deal and decided to try them out!! Great fresh food!! Ordered the \"cooked to order\" with chow fun and beef. Very tasty!! Garlic shrimp was yummy!! Got a free dessert as well (rice pudding) that was delicious!! Definitely coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"We had the meat lovers (beef, chicken, pork, and spam) fried rice. Great flavor and a good sized portion. Wife had beef lo mein. $20 for the two of us with drinks, so pretty average price. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came in during my lunch break and was immediately greeted by friendly and quirky staff. I was only grabbing To-Go but the staff waited on me and started me off with 3 egg rolls as an appetizer for checking in on Yelp. LOVE their take on mochiko chicken and making them into wings. Recommending this place to all my co workers"}
{"text":"It's really good.
O my flaming noodle is my favorite, u should try it.
In addition, they use special ways to cook ice cream.
I never eat in another place"}
{"text":"Well, I will start this off with a positive they give you plenty of food... menu selections are good and the place is clean (I like that) however the reason for the 2 stars is we ordered Hawaiian food which online said is their specialties and was sadly disappointed the flavor was just not there. The mac salad is a mustard blend like you buy in the store from a carton.... and last but not least we ordered drinks and had to laugh because it was the size of a water cup or a kids happy meal...no wait those are bigger lol... probably won't be back"}
{"text":"New place just opened. Very friendly staff, helped us figure out how to order. You can get an entree with choice of sides or go aka carte and select your rice or noodle then add meat and veggies. They cook everything to order, not buffet style, so that is a huge plus! Takes a minute longer but worth it.
Hawaiian and Asian blend with smoothies and several appetizers and deserts.
We ordered the Kalbi Ribs and Kalua pig with Lo Mien noodles and seaweed salad. All was very good with there own sweet chili sauce. One entry can be easily split between two people.  Entrees around $10 and very fair for the amount and quality.
Hope they do well- we will be stopping there instead of Panda down the road."}
