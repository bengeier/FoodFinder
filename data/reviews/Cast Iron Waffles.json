{"text":"Omg tried the waffles today and they are amazing!!!! Don't need any syrup they are sweet, delicious ! New favorite breakfast place!!!!"}
{"text":"We went looking to try the Lumberjack waffle at  the Ballantyne location and found out they were sold out. I guess that's what happens when you show up at 11am. But none the less, we had amazing waffles (peanut butter cup deluxe and the deluxe). I'm looking forward to coming back, earlier of course for the Lumberjack."}
{"text":"Bacon and maple buttercream waffle. Great salty and sweet balance. Great coffee as well."}
{"text":"Cute little shop near Birkdale. Waffles were a little different... Belgium type are not like a typical American breakfast style but rather like a sweet little treat!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Cast Iron Waffles, so my husband and I went to check it out this morning.  The waffles there were so good!  They are Belgian liege waffles, so are very rich and sweet.  I was a little worried when they brought each of us only 1 waffle, especially since we paid something like $4 for 1 waffle.  But the waffles are so rich that you couldn't eat 2.  

I ordered a waffle with nutella streusel and powdered sugar, and my husband ordered a deluxe waffle with nutella, frozen strawberries, fresh bananas and homemade whipped cream.  Both of us were so impressed with how tasty these waffles were.  We were still a little hungry, so we ordered 1 more waffle - a deluxe one with nutella, double order of fresh peaches and the homemade whipped cream.  We split it and really, we were pushing ourselves to finish it.  It was so delicious!

Next time, I'll just do 1 deluxe waffle and a 16 oz chai.  The chai was extra thick and creamy as well, so when I ordered my usual 20 oz and mixed it with 1 1/2 waffles, I started feeling like I really didn't want any more sugar.  But it was very good and now that I know the deal, I'll just order accordingly next time.

The owners were there and were very involved and friendly, as were all of the employees.  Also, I saw a sticker on the window that said \"Free Wi-fi\" and I'm always happy to have another place that I can go with my laptop to work and change it up a bit.

I'll be back, Cast Iron Waffles!"}
{"text":"Cast Iron Waffle KNOWS waffles! I've searched for a place that serves Belgian liege waffles for a few years without any luck.  
My husband and I traveled an hour for breakfast at the Southpark location this morning, and it was definitely worth it! We had a smorgasbord of waffles this morning, the simple Naked, Nutella, The Lumberjack, and Slowberry.  All were amazing! We also had Cast Irons version of a caramel macchiato and mocha latte which gave Starbucks a run for their money. 
Quaint little place with lots of character. Quiet, early on a Sunday morning. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I made a recent trip and were first timers. We were both impressed with the taste and quality. I had the slowberry waffle which was fantastic and my wife had the cinnamon roll waffle which she really enjoyed. We love to support local businesses and would strongly recommend others to give it a try."}
{"text":"The waffles are good and the staff is friendly. I went on a Sunday morning and they were understaffed so the service was slow. After reading other reviews, I decided to stay away from the coffee. I tried a fruit smoothie instead. It looked inviting; however it did not taste good. I ordered a mango strawberry smoothie. It wasn't sweet. In fact it was a bit sour. I threw it away after a few sips. 

Regarding the waffle, I ordered a naked waffle (without any toppings). It was good and very sweet. I think the waffle is ideal as a snack, but it didn't feel like a breakfast item."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have some gourmet style waffles for breakfast or lunch! I tried the deluxe waffle and my boyfriend had the lumberjack and the cinnamon waffles! These waffles are filling so I'd suggest 1 to start or 2 max if you're extra hungry. Don't be fooled by the smaller size these are decadent. The staff are all very friendly and easy going. Coffee here was just okay IMO and yes THEY ONLY SERVE WAFFLES but trust me they will fill you up just fine."}
{"text":"The best waffles ever.  I used to go almost every weekend with my family and now that we are not in Charlotte anymore, I miss it dearly.  The service here is great as well.  While the seating is limited, there are tables outside as well.  The Belgian Liege waffles are fantastic with any topping.  There is no better!"}
{"text":"The waffles here are sooooo yummy.  My favorite is the \"Lumberjack\" - maple syrup and crumbled bacon on top.  There are many tables so come earlier in the morning before other people are up to get a seat.  And, alas, I thought their coffee tasted terrible!  I ended up throwing it away as I thought it was undrinkable."}
{"text":"Found this eatery on yelp and decided to go with my boyfriend.... the atmosphere was very quaint and staff was very friendly. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. I would recommend to any waffle lover or foodie!"}
{"text":"We went back- this time to the physical location on Longstone Ln. In the interest of full disclosure we were invited back by Chris D. after my last review. Here's the story:
AWESOME! We had the Deluxe & Lumberjack waffles & tried the strawberry smoothies again. The waffles were DELISH! The smoothies were COMPLETELY different this go 'round- thick with rich whipped cream. We loved it~ no denying. The staff was kind & courteous and we couldn't have been happier. Go get a waffle Charlotte, u won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Perfect if you're in the mood for waffles. They offer lots of options and the waffles are very sweet. The coffee was good and they had many flavors that could be added."}
{"text":"Quaint little coffee shop.  Waffles are in the liege style and are fairly different from what most Americans think of as Belgian waffles.  Sweet all by themselves, the shop has a host of options for toppings (though I haven't noticed any savory options).  Has become my \"go to\" snack spot in the area."}
{"text":"Great waffles! Try the naked ones. I got some frozen ones too. They are decent, but as expected not as great as the fresh ones."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying out, but experience was tainted by them forgetting to make our order. We patiently waited for them to bring it, finally realizing that was not happening. After playing the who's fault is it game behind the counter, our food was made. The food was good, but would have tasted far better with even the slightest of apologies for the oversight. Disappointing."}
{"text":"First tried this place last year, it was really good- probably 5 stars. Stopped again recently and they no longer offer gluten free. Super disappointed. The coffee drinks were good but not enough for me to stop in just for those. Won't be going back, sadly."}
{"text":"This is my revised rating after conversations with an owner that is interested with his customer's satisfaction."}
{"text":"Trying something new while we were in town. Definitely want to come back again..the waffles were delicious!  Each of us tried a different one and they were all great."}
{"text":"Meh, this was just ok. Tried this on a whim since we'd both heard of it but didn't know too much about it. I read other reviews beforehand so I had an idea of what to expect. Other reviews were right.. not much for parking at all. I ordered the Lumberjack w/ a coffee and he ordered the Cinnamon Roll waffle. Not overly impressed at all, very little seating inside and the waffles were 'fine'. The coffee made me want to go somewhere else for a better cup afterwards. The employees--not too happy. I won't be back.."}
{"text":"The last two times we've been , we've been disappointed. I asked the girls what has changed , the waffles are rubbery , and it's just not that awesome waffle experience anymore. ...She tells me that after 11 a.m they don't cook the waffles in the \" Iron \"  , they just heat up the waffles \" in a microwave \" that were made earlier . ???? & ???? When people go to eat at Cast Iron Waffle , That'd be what we want .....A Cast Iron Waffle . It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop tucked into a community of townhomes. Waffles were to die for and you can too them with whatever you like. There's not much seating, maybe a two or three tables, but there's a bar you can sit at. 

All the coffee is fair trade as well and I was so happy to see they have traditional espresso drinks like a true machiatto! New fav spot!"}
{"text":"My husband had been bugging me to try this place for a while now, so I finally gave in. I am not a big waffle eater but I decided to get one and a coffee. I came in with my husband and daughter at 3pm on Good Friday. One person was working, a young girl. She asked what we wanted. I asked her to give me a minute, I had never been here before. So I got a waffle with bacon and maple icing, my husband got the cinammon roll waffle and my daughter got a plain waffle with whipped cream. I saw a waffle maker, but she put our pre-made waffles, not made to order, in a toaster oven type thing and heated it up. Maybe the waffle maker is just for show. I also ordered a coffee, no coffee in any container. I advised the girl and she said she would get some. So she proceeded to heat up our waffles, bring them to the table, make the two ladies behind us some coffee. At this point I was slightly frustrated. Not only did my waffle, which by the way is the size of a pop tart, taste like card board,it wasn't even hot.I could barely cut it with the plastic knife and fork. I went to the counter to tell the girl I no longer wanted my coffee, and I would like my money back. She states, It's almost ready. I also advised her the waffles were horrible. I asked her if I could get the manager's name and number. She said, he isn't here. I just gave up at this point. She did provide me with the owners name and the email for the business. I just think that for $4.50 a waffle, they would be made to order. I never did get my money back either. So we just walked out, without my coffee. We will definitely NOT be going back. They should also have planned better for a Holiday and get people in there that actually want to be there, and be helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome quaint coffee shop that has a great selection of Belgian waffles.  I got The Lumberjack (maple syrup, maple buttercream & bacon), my two kids got cinnamon roll waffle with whipped cream & strawberries, while my wife got the sticky bun waffle and an iced coffee.  Great way to spend Father's Day!"}
{"text":"I notice the sign while driving by and decided to give it a try.  I had their special with three berry compote and fresh made whipped cream and it was one of the best waffles I've ever had.  The coffee is quite good as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place. So much so that I invited my best friend and brother to join me for my first time. We love waffles and thought if the name had waffles in it, it had to be good. Well, my friend and I  arrived first. It was hot inside and I mean the hot that you can't eat comfortable. While we waited for my brother, we ordered 2 small frapps, to cool us off, they cost over $10. Starbucks is not even that high. Plus they were not all that good. We also were able to see the waffles, which were small and took forever for you to get them after ordering them."}
{"text":"My one star might be a bit misleading, as I have not tried anything to eat or drink here. But this is because i have not been able to try anything because of all of the moms and dads and their offspring in the place. I have tried on THREE separate occasions to go in and try the coffee and waffles only to find all of the tables and the chairs at the bar occupied. I am always reassured by the staff that a table will soon open up, but I have waited up to 20 minutes only to find families camping at the tables. 

The last straw occurred on my visit on Tuesday, December 28th. Of course, all of the tables were occupied by \"breeders\" and their children, so we were going to take 2 of the chairs at the bar. Just as we were going to sit down, a woman puts her kids in the chairs to watch the waffles being made. Both the woman and the female staff person just looked at me, expecting me to make a scene, I suppose. I just stared at each, then walked out.

As a member of a 1000+ person organization that just moved to Ballantyne, I will be recommending against visiting this place to all that will listen.

To Chris D. in response to his/her comment:

Your comment is understandable, however, you completely ignored the part about the person allowing her children to take up TWO seating areas while paying customers were trying to sit. Can this be expected in the future?"}
{"text":"I love this place. Not your typical breakfast. You have to go in knowing that you may or may not get a seat, you will probably wait in line, but the waffles are amazing. I don't do coffee, but the hot chocolate and a naked waffle on a cold morning sure hits the spot."}
{"text":"Cozy, great food, excellent staff. They have regular deals in the texting club. The naked waffle is perfection, but all of their toppings compliment the basic waffle very well. My favorite breakfast food."}
{"text":"Great waffles. These have that sugar in them that doesn't melt when it's cooked.. Sooooo good. Highly recommended!!! It's also in a pretty cool location."}
{"text":"Good but small waffles. I would like a full size waffle, cover the whole waffle iron with that batter....."}
{"text":"Get the naked waffle! It's so good and nothing is needed because the waffles are already sweet!"}
{"text":"cute and very trending place...

However, I only gave the experience 1-star.

They are more concerned about global coffee fair trade than they are about the local environment... ironic.

They use plastic plates and utensils... and they don't recycle.  WOW!  I thought everyone recycled these days."}
{"text":"The coffee was good. The waffles came undercooked and underwhelming. There are no real healthy choices here,  everything is sugar laden. Tried the waffle with fruit, and it's not even fresh fruit, just soggy canned stuff.  The bill for 2 small waffles and 2 lattes was with tip was $24. Not at all worth it."}
{"text":"Waffles are delicious, and the coffee is good too. Plain Waffles are a bit sweet but delicious without syrup or anything else."}
{"text":"Great waffles from this place The service was very slow and it took a long time to get our waffles.
 Nobody in the place but it was very slow  & very expensive as well parking is below par"}
{"text":"The Waffles are wonderful and the workers warm and inviting. Great atmosphere as well.  This is a Waffle and Coffee House that does it right!"}
{"text":"NOT our cup of tea. 

With that said, the place is cute and the workers are nice so I would love to give them more stars but I'm basing it solely on our taste.  

These are not ordinary waffles but liege waffles meaning they are infused with sugar balls in them. We were expecting more options than liege waffles since our whole family love waffles but guess we didn't research enough. 

We ordered 1) plain, 2) whipped cream 3) nutella & berries. The plain enough was so sweet that we could barely finish it. My son who LOVES waffles and nutella AND whipped cream took 2 bites and said he couldn't eat it. 

If you love sugary stuff this is the place for you! But for us it was too over the top and we couldn't enjoy the waffle or its toppings as much as we would have liked to."}
{"text":"These are the best waffles I've ever had! My whole family loves these things. They are super thick and sweet. They are so tasty plain, but the toppings are a fun touch. Their cappuccino is yummy too!"}
{"text":"I tried them out this morning/afternoon with my reluctant hubby, and couldn't be more delighted!  So tasty!!  I didn't really find anything to be excessive in terms of price (2 deluxe waffles, and 2 cups for coffee for 14 bucks), especially considering you're getting a specialty item!  Excellent coffee, out of this world waffles, and very friendly staff!  They even brewed my decaf coffee as a one off, which impressed me, because at any other chain, I'd have gotten whatever was left in the pot from the morning.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have always had great customer service. Today was not one of those days. The female worker with blue eyes and brown hair pulled into a bun was extremely unprofessional. My friend ordered a plain waffle and I ordered an Elvis waffle. Because my waffle already had toppings on it I chose not to ask for maple syrup. My friend wanted maple syrup for her waffle. After waiting a few moments at the counter for assistance my friend politely said \"excuse me, may I have some maple syrup?\" The mentioned waitress then rolled her eyes and rudely said, \"our waffles are sweetened on the inside and we don't serve syrup or butter with our waffles.\" I'm sorry but there was no reason for the rudeness. The lady could have handled the situation in a more positive manner. Then shortly after we finished eating our waffles, I got back in line to order a second waffle. The customer in front of me was asking about a smoothie and the mentioned female worker spit an ice cube out of her mouth and back into a cup before responding to the customer. It was incredibly disgusting and highly unprofessional. Other than the customer service, the waffles were amazing. I highly recommend trying all of their different flavors."}
{"text":"I have eaten a liege waffle in Salt Lake City and loved it so much that when we came to Charlotte for business I looked to see if I could get them here. I drove for 40 minutes to get one and it did not disappoint.  So good that I ate 
2 of them to get my fix. My favorite is with Biscoff and whipped cream. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Sunday morning we wanted to try a new place for a quick and delicious breakfast. We found the cast iron waffle and boy were we in for a treat. Friendly employees, delicious waffles and great atmosphere. The girls loved the envy waffles and couldn't get enough of it! We will definitely be back for some more exciting waffles to try !"}
{"text":"ErrrrrMahhhhGawwww!!!  Go here people!!! It is so so so good!!  The waffles are top notch!!!  I really wanted to order one of all of them but be forewarned they are very rich!!  I have gotten the cinnamon one twice (its redic delish) and the chocolate chip one once (also so yum)!!!  Great place for a sweet-tooth snack :)  The staff is also fantastic!! Super nice, helpful and the food comes out quick yay!"}
{"text":"You know...as someone who isn't a waffle connoisseur...I can't tell you how these stack up with other Belgian waffles.  But the experience was quite lovely, and the waffles were delightful, along with the service, so that's all I need for 5 stars!

The location is a bit strange-- yes, below a row of townhouses, in a cookie cutter community.  But when you walk in, it's cozy, and clean, with some high tops and lower tables, it feels neighborhood-y. Thankfully my GPS took me the right way, because I was worried based on Julia M and Chad E's experiences locating the place!  

The woman at the register was manning the shop alone.  (It was about 10:45 on a Thursday when we went.) She explained to us how the waffles are the liege variety, and made from a dough, so they'd be denser than a traditional waffle, and there's sugar in the dough, so it'll be naturally sweet and crisp on the outside.  She also explained to us the different varieties of teas and coffees available (there are a bajillion syrup flavors btw.)

We ended up getting a plain (which is with powdered sugar) and a Nutella banana strawberry.  The whipped cream is the real deal...no icky plasticky Cool Whip here, thank goodness. The waffles had a nice sweet chew, and crusty exterior...and as I peeled mine bit by bit, there were little sugar chunks embedded in the dough.  Loved it!  It was like a mini sugar explosion. 

This woman miraculously juggled it all, running around behind the counter, steeping tea, making waffles, topping them, tending to the other customers and even the old-fashioned soda machine in the back. (Which by the way is precious...she explained how sometimes the quarters don't take , so it's hit or miss if you'll get one via vending, or if you'll have to get someone to come over and open the machine for you!)

Bottom line, I think it's a nice spot, and if I lived closer, I'd definitely put it on my list of tasty treats.  

BTW: We were offered free refills on our Apricot infused iced tea and even on our hot berry teas.  Nice."}
{"text":"Great waffles! Small cafe but every local should try their waffles!!"}
{"text":"Really really good authentic tasting Leige waffles.....if you haven't experienced Leige waffle you need to - NOT your average Belgian waffle! They also have gluten free options. Outdoor seating too. Service was really slow - we waited 1/2 hour for our 3 waffles - one wAs gluten free and they said takes about 15 minutes longer, but overall a really great place :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the people who have previously visited this wonderful establishment but if you have not tried Cast Iron Waffles in Piedmont, you are losing a part of your soul. Friendliness, happiness, amazzzzing waffles with toppings galore, and a coffee that will take you back to a place of comfort and satisfaction. All other ratings below a 4 star come see me. Mr. Stevie"}
{"text":"Waffles were so good, but other breakfast items could make this place a hit. Also, not a large seating area."}
{"text":"Workers here are so nice! Also a very good place to eat if you are into specialty waffles(: it's just 10 minutes from my house so me and some friends skate down there for breakfast sometimes."}
{"text":"I have been dying to come here for months and today I finally made my journey. It's a 30 minute drive from my house and I have to say, I would drive a half an hour on a regular basis for this waffle. To die for. Chewy, crispy, not too sweet. It's the perfect treat. The owner was lovely and the coffee was great. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Their waffles are banging!!!
***2 waffles will do you right!***
My favorite is the Sloberry and the fruit with Nutella"}
{"text":"We (reluctantly) hit up Cast Iron Waffles after a recommendation by a friend and to make it short and sweet... we didn't really care about it. We walked past Terrace Cafe on the way to Cast Iron Waffles and the smell of incredible food was overwhelming but we already had plans on meeting our friend so we kept walking.

For being a restaurant called CAST IRON WAFFLES I figured they would have some sort of magical waffle amazingness... but they didn't. The lumberjack waffle was ok but not at all worth the $5 price tag especially with the plastic plate and fork to eat it with. 

The place had plenty of different coffee and drink options but as far as Waffles go you should stick to going to your local Waffle House :)"}
{"text":"I think I may have caught them on a not so stellar day.  I came here with my hubby on a cool winter day, excited about some warm and delicious waffles to set our taste buds a flutter. We ordered our waffles and sat and waited for the liege lusciousness to begin.  I got the one with bacon on it, the Lumberjack, because everything is better with bacon and hubby got the peanut butter cup waffle.  They were brought to our table, we took a few bites and meh!!  They were cold, a bit hard and a bit on the overly sweet side.  We finished them but were both a tad bit disappointed.  We will definitely give them another try and just ask that they make us fresh ones and not ones reheated from the case. There is a huge difference between a liege waffle hot off the cast iron waffle \"press\" and one sitting around and getting reheated.  If you have had the former, you will understand while the latter doesn't hold up.

The atmosphere was kind of cold but maybe it was just because of the weather outside. Doesn't strike me as a place where someone sets up shop and tries to stay all day.  The person working was nice and friendly and seemed to enjoy being there.  There are many drink options as well but I passed on getting a coffee because I had just finished one at home.  Maybe next time.  

I will give this place another shot for sure and try a drink, a fresh waffle and something with little to no glaze to overpower the waffle.  I have a feeling that might add a star or two but based on atmosphere, taste and quality for my visit, I give it a solid three."}
{"text":"It is a quaint place and the staff was friendly. The waffles were alright, nothing spectacular. Honestly the coffee was much worse. It was nice to try something different, but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in here this morning and we were so happy we did :).  We both ordered nutella waffles - they were the best waffles I've ever eaten.  The have a pretty decent coffee selection.  I got a mocha latte and it was delicious.  My husband got a strawberry banana smoothie and that was excellent as well!  The place is decorated really cute; like retro.  The seating is kind of tight on a Saturday morning, but we were able to grab a table."}
{"text":"This was an amazing find!  I literally stumbled upon this place and was absolutely impressed with it.  This is not your typical waffle place and their coffee is divine.  Great place for a quiet meeting or a quick bite."}
{"text":"Interesting that my review from a couple of years ago has mysteriously been deleted.  Were not impressed, as the waffles will definitely provide you with the sugar headache, as they are excessively sweet.  In my original post, I joked that it would be a great place to eat, and then drop off the kids at the grandparents house.

During our visit, the music was too loud.  They choose to put the speaker right above where you order, so we had to practically yell our order.  The person who took the order was clearly having a bad day, and was not very polite.  We ate with plastic ware on cheap throw away plates.  There is great potential here, but it's simply a place to purchase a sugary waffle that won't require syrup.  Heaven help you if you use both.

After my original review was posted, I did receive an email from the owner asking me to reconsider or delete my review.  The very purpose of Yelp was to provide an unbiased review of our local businesses.  When you do well, you get rated as such.  When you don't; same thing.  Majority rules, so if you do more things right than wrong, your ratings score stays high.

I declined the offer then, but might reconsider in the near future, to provide a comparison.  It's been two years, and would gladly prepare another review based on this next visit.  I just didn't want to have the review corrupted.  Now, I've found it's been deleted, so in all fairness, I've voted here again."}
{"text":"Small, cute shop hidden in Piedmont Row with some window seats, tables, and one big square booth. There are also a few tables outside with a view of the fountain. The waffles come out a few minutes after you order and are warm, dense and sweet. We only tried the peanut butter cup one with peanut butter and chocolate drizzle, powdered sugar and whipped cream w/ chocolate chips. It was very good, but too sweet for me. I'm interested in trying other flavors. The highlight for me is their unique teas to choose from. Fun place for a snack."}
{"text":"Awesome waffles and great customer service. I got the slowberry which was super delish-- a liiiiiitle on the sweeter side but next time I will ask for now powdered sugar which I think would make it just perfect. My hubby got the lumberjack and it was Devine!  The atmosphere is quaint and cozy-- coffee shop feel. definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"great food good environment recommend deluxe waffle. fantastic if ur looking for an easy waffle brunch - simple but great"}
{"text":"Amazing waffles, friendly service, a neighborhood charm. It does get pretty packed on the weekends and it's small so not a lot of place to sit. But the waffles make you forget all that!"}
{"text":"A lifetime ago I worked as a barista in a coffee shop that made toddy based drinks.  It's the only place I've ever had them and I was beyond thrilled to find them here! My iced mocha toddy based drink plus a naked waffle was out of this world.  This is the kind of business you hope never ever ever ever EVER closes because it's too amazing!"}
{"text":"Listen, I am an INSANE twice weekly patron of the Ballantyne location.

After my girl Olive left, I stopped driving from Cotswold all the way out there for my waffle fix.  

I've gone to the Piedmont location now at least 10 times and once I stupidly brought seven friends.

For starters, their staff is rude.  Unhelpful, unfriendly and the one girl can't make a mocha from toddy, milk and chocolate to save her life.  This same girl served up 8 burned waffles to my friends and I.  She said she had turned the waffle iron up too high and was scraping everything off.  Every single waffle had a layer of black on the bottom.  

Another visit my waffle was mushy and slightly gray inside.  I also do not believe they put the additional sugar on the waffles as these compared to Ballantyne are decidedly less sweet and crunchy.

Secondly, the atmosphere is totally different.  It's very cold feeling and the music is way too loud hard rock for 8am.  Ballantyne is warm, great music and you could sit there for an hour relaxing.

The last time we went we found out that  the locations are not owned by the same owners as Ballantyne so we couldn't use our punch card there.  BAD BUSINESS.  So, in addition to being the subpar location you also wouldn't honor a frequent guest card? I will give kudos to the chick with the bright red hair, she's a major improvement from the idiot who worked there before her.

Today I cruised back up to Ballantyne to have my amazing waffle and iced mocha in bliss.  I was late for work and didn't even give a damn."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a quick bite. I ordered the sticky bun waffle. The waffle had a crispy exterior, but a thick interior. I prefer my liege waffles with a airy light interior. The candied pecans topping was absolutely delicious, but the waffle itself was just a tad bit too sweet for my taste. I would have just ordered waffles with fruit instead. I also ordered a mocha latte, which I thought was one of the best coffee I've had, EVER. I would definitely make another trip out here to try another waffle (just not the specialty ones, way too sweet for me)."}
{"text":"came here last weekend and got the peanut butter cup waffle and it was amazing. my mom and sister got a coffee and tea and said it was very good as well. they have a really nice selection of teas with unique flavors you don't see everywhere. the shop itself is cute and cozy. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Thought honestly I did not come here for waffles, j came for coffee and a \"healthy option\" açaí bowl. This was the worst experience that I've had in a restaurant and for a lousy claim to an açaí bowl. 
I ordered to go, to get something quick to go just a coffee and an açaí bowl, then comes Reason 1.) I was standing at the end of the bar waiting for my açaí bowl to come out and they lady working behind the counter rudely asked me \"what are you doing standing here....?! You need to go sit down and wait for your food\" I wanted to tell her I would but there was NO WHERE to sit. So I ended up standing and crowded some poor family while hovering over their table. I felt bed. 
Reason 2: I asked for a toddy, the girl behind the counter then asked me \"iced or hot\" I replied iced. Then another lady came back and explained to the cashier that she didn't know how to make an iced toddy and was confused and needed help...but the cashier was too annoyed to help her so I ended up changing my drink to an iced coffee to make it easier on them. 
Reason 3: when my poor excuse of an açaí bowl came out it was COMPLETELY watery, as explained by the picture below, it was so watery it was more watery than a regular smoothie, so I showed the girl behind the counter how bad the consistency was and her response \"oh well...it's already made....what can I do about it?!\" This was a $7 bowl and you think they would care enough about their reputation to be kind and re-make the açaí bowl or try and satisfy the customer. The two people working today were just so absolutely rude I cannot believer that they think they can talk to people in such a way."}
{"text":"Tasty!! Very sugary but that can be good on occasion. But, the service wasn't great and the place seems a bit run down...almost dirty. Needs a spruce up."}
{"text":"Their waffles are amazing!!!!!  The inside of the place is cozy and it's perfect for a quiet coffee time with a friend or simply just being on your lap top.  Everyone that works there is friendly and knowledgeable about what's on the menu.  I love this place."}
{"text":"If you were given a blind taste test and told to identify the food that you ate, no one would guess that they had eaten a waffle. I tried the lumberjack waffle which comes with maple butter and bacon crumbles on top.

First the waffle. It is a dense black hole of dough. I understand why so many reviewers thought that it was only partially cooked. This is not your fluffy waffle with pockets of air bubbles inside. Rather, it's exactly like a hunk of half-cooked cookie dough. Solid through and through. It doesn't come with syrup. There are 2 reasons that Cast Iron Waffles doesn't offer syrup. 1) This kind of dense doughy waffle wouldn't absorb any syrup. The syrup would bounce right off this thing, and 2) syrup costs money.

Now lets talk about the toppings. The \"maple butter\" is really extremely sweet maple icing, like the stuff you would decorate a cake with. There is a lot of it and it completely overpowers any other tastes on the plate. Can't taste the bacon and can't taste the waffle.

The owners of Cast Iron are trying to run a restaurant as cheaply as possible. Everything screams CHEAP in this place. Plastic plates and forks for example. Did I mention there's no syrup? And, get this, self serve room temp tap water that you get from an urn at the end of the counter. You get up from your table and fetch yourself a small cup of luke warm water.  For the diner's pleasure, a stack of small plastic cups sits in repose by the urn. I would be embarrassed to bring a guest to this place.

I would suggest that the owners change the name of this small, badly executed restaurant to \"Maple Frosted Cookie Dough\""}
{"text":"Very elegant Waffle House, normally I can eat 1 large Belgium waffle. Owner advised most can only eat 1 of his waffles.

Flavor was spot on, didn't get coffee: Service and  quality of goods are accurate to the price.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love waffles, and I love the concept of this place, but I have a few problems:

1.  The South Park location is hard to find (maps app takes you to the wrong section) and no one working in Piedmont Row or walking around seemed to know of this place. Seems like a sign board or better advertising might be useful. 

2.  Fresh cooked would definitely be better but I didn't get that option. I went at 5:00 on a Sunday afternoon, and was told that all waffles are made in the morning then wrapped in plastic wrap. I bought several frozen to take home for others but thought that the fresh one would actually be freshly cooked. It was wrapped in plastic the same as the frozen ones so there was absolutely no justification for paying twice as much. At that point, my credit card has already been charged so there was no turning back. 
 
3.  The afternoon counter guy was not the most helpful. When I asked him a question about the syrup, rather than answering in words, he merely flung out his arm pointing at the syrup behind him. I had to repeat my question in 2 different ways before he actually answered. I was the only customer in the restaurant and it was still 3 hrs before closing, so I'm not sure what the problem was. 

After taking the waffles home and reheating them, I did think they were good. Different from the Belgian style I typically like- denser and heavier but sweeter and delicious. Based on the issues above, I don't think this experience deserved more than 3 stars but I'll probably give it another try when I know I can get a fresh waffle."}
{"text":"I first had liege waffles when I lived in the UK and did some traveling in Belgium and the Netherlands - I fell in love with liege waffles with Nutella. I was so happy to learn about Cast Iron Waffles here in Charlotte and was excited to go. 

First off, I did my homework...I looked at their menu and saw that all they sell are liege waffles and coffee/tea/hot chocolate/smoothies. If you are looking for \"regular\" waffles or a huge breakfast, go elsewhere. Also, know that liege waffles are NOT like waffles you have at IHOP - they are smaller, richer, sweeter and chewier...and for me, much better!

So, Cast Iron Waffles is a little hard to find - I saw the \"Waffles - Espresso\" on the side of the building and pulled in, but the friend I was meeting missed it and had to call me to guide her in. This place is TINY - exactly 4 tables inside and a small bar that seats maybe 6, at the most. There is outdoor seating, as well (maybe another 5-6 tables) but we went during winter and no one was outside. We had a to wait a few minutes, but a table came open. We ordered and paid, and they waited to make our waffles until we got a table. The latte I ordered was great!

The waffle itself was fantastic! It was small and thick, with chunks of pearl sugar on the bottom. They drizzled a little Nutella on top (maybe 1-2 tablespoons) - not too much, just enough and I was in Heaven! My friend who met me had never even heard of liege waffles (she did her homework, too, though) but she was raving over them as much as I was. She got hers with powdered sugar only, and got a chai tea and enjoyed them both.

As I said, we waited 5-10 minutes for a table to come open, but people eating seemed nice enough to clear out quickly so others could sit. Our order came out a few minutes later and we were done a few minutes after that. We lingered awhile over our drinks, but left as soon as we saw others come in who needed to sit.

For me, it's a splurge place, because the waffles are sweet and rich - but I will be back. Thanks for bringing something different & delicious to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"In a quaint neighborhood of brick homes comes a Northern Europe mojo from the young lady with blonde hair and waffle patience, from the rack of Belgian waffles, and the Indie rock playing at a tasteful level.  The ideal place for reading the newspaper and watching a couple across the street play frisbee with their kid at 8:39 am.  I finished my basic Belgian waffle at light speed and I am going to leave before I put on sweatpants and make a fool out of myself.  It's good Belgian for a good price."}
{"text":"Amazing warm waffles at a very reasonable price! I had the traditional Nutella & fruit, my date had the lumberjack waffle with bacon & maple cream. It was my fave & I would order that one next time. The service was fast & friendly!"}
{"text":"I went to their location in Ballantyne before and had loved it! So i decided to try one out since it was closer to where i was staying. I will never be coming back to this location.. EVER! The place is done very nicely and looked super cute! I ordered a cappuccino and a waffle with Nutella and fruits. Now, trust me when I say, I LOVE anything with sugar and I threw this waffle in the trash! It was uncooked on the inside and I could literally taste the batter. It was terrible. The nutella, was barely there. It was a disaster for 4.5$. The cappuccino was served in a foam cup even though it was not a take out. I expected a place like this to atleast serve coffee in a mug when I'm paying so much for it. I got a half full 12oz foam cup that probably had 2 oz of just foam and bitter coffee. One of the worst coffees I had as well. Needless to say, I will never be returning."}
{"text":"I live in Dallas TX and have a 16-18 hour drive to get here. Guess what? I do it. Their waffles are that good. REAL DEAL Belgian style with the yeasty dough, etc. If you think you know what a Belgian waffle is, you DON'T so just go here and learn something that will make yer stomach smile. Took my buddy Skip here and he thought it was awesome also! No one I have ever turned on to this joint has not returned for more. Savvy?"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in South Park. Quiet atmosphere. Great place to study. Nice employees! Fast service ! Nice spot in southpark area"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning with my family, and I've got to say that I'm impressed! Delicious waffles (we had the powdered sugar), good espresso, and great coffee. Sure it's a small spot, but I love the character that they manage to pack into another otherwise bland South Charlotte strip mall. I actually enjoy spots that are vibrant and full of customers... whether they are kids watching the waffles being made, or professionals grabbing their morning joe. Cast Iron was busy, but that's a sign of a good business. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Best. Waffles. Ever. I had a biscoff waffle AND a maple butter waffle. Delicious!!! Need bigger drink selection though for those of us unhealthy types who like soda in the morning :)"}
{"text":"Yum! We just moved back to Charlotte and checked out this place for breakfast this morning. I didn't find it tough to find at all; actually w e decided to go after I noticed it while driving on Ardrey Kell. It's in the Cedar Walk neighborhood, close to Buffalo Wings and Rings.

The waffles were delicious and just what I had expected. We tried these delicious types of waffles while in Belgium several years ago and were excited to see them come to life in Charlotte. As others mentioned, this type of waffle is already sweet (dense dough with crystallized sugar pieces baked in) and smaller than what we consider Belgian waffles, so definitely keep that in mind while picking out your toppings unless you are looking for a dessert. If I'm not mistaken, I believe we actually ate them as dessert, fresh out of a waffle food truck, while in Brussels. I chose to top mine with the maple butter, and I was happy that the maple butter came on the side so I could add as much or as little as I wanted.  My husband had the nutella and seemed equally as impressed. The waffles arrived quickly and were piping hot.

I have to admit that I find some of the complaints about the waffles being so sweet to be a little unfair. Yes, the waffles are sweet but that's exactly what this type of waffle is. Liege waffles are completely different from their Belgian counterparts, and it's obvious that some people didn't realize what they were ordering, or expected something completely different, and judged their meal based on that. If you are looking for a typical waffle joint with the typical Americanized toppings this place probably isn't it and you would be better off going to IHOP or the Waffle House. I personally love this type of waffle and will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"It was  good. My waffle was cold and they gave me new one but after making wierd face. Since i was from out of town and thought not cool."}
{"text":"Waffles are dense and pastry-like, authentic Belgian. Portions are manageable, and coffee is excellent."}
{"text":"Definitivamente la comida es muy buena el servicio es rápido la mesera es muy amable y muy limpió el lugar Ami lo personal si me gusto."}
{"text":"SWEET GOOGLY MOOGLY these things are yummy! 

Totally different from anything I've ever had, but I knew walking in, not to expect Waffle House quality here (thanks fellow Yelpers!) 

I went on a Thursday morning so the place was empty (awesome news for me) the girl behind the counter was nice she gave me some suggestions but I knew exactly what I was going to get the moment I walked in....

Hello BACON waffle! 

Officially called the Lumberjack, this thing rocks! It's their classic waffle topped with bacon and maple butter. 

The word \"sweet\" is an understatement for this thing. The waffle is dense, loaded with sugar and that damn maple butter is heavenly....top that off with an absolutely ridiculous amount of bacon topping (always a good thing) and it's nothing short of ahhhmazing!!!!  

I will offer a warning though, since it's sooo sweet, take your time eating it. Seriously, with this much sugar...slower is better. Ha. 

Overall, the waffles are scrumptious. Do your sweet tooth a favor and give this place a try! It doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"So so so delicious. I get a waffle with chocolate chips and whipped cream! Hits the spot everytime"}
{"text":"One word.  Nutella!  I never knew how amazing nutella could be on a waffle until I had one of theirs.  Then we added fruit to it and it became perfection.  Super delicious but a smidge on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Were were excited to see this small venue open in the neighborhood. The big mistake was bringing friends from out of town for the first time.
The waffles were thick and too chewy, with any topping just to sweet. I would imagine it's more of a kids thing. No meat.. just waffles. No one in our group finished theirs.  I could barely wait for lunch time I was so hungry. On the other hand, I thought the coffee was great.
I do hope these nice people can make it, but unfortunately, not with us as customers... especially since \"The Skillet' opened just 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"For waffles and coffee you can't beat it and great prices. The waffles are like nothing you have had. It is more like a dough than batter.  Must try!"}
{"text":"I recently went back to give them another try for a quick waffle on my way to a meeting.  The service was a little on the slow side, but the waffle was warm and tasty.  This time I knew to get a plain waffle with just a sprinkle of powered sugar instead of getting one with all the extra sweet stuff."}
{"text":"decent waffles for a premade and reheated waffle. 

for $4 for a small waffle I would expect something made fresh though..."}
{"text":"If you've never had the opportunity of trying a Belgian Liege style waffle, A) You truly haven't lived and B) You're in for a treat. Cast Iron Waffles is churning these things out like they're going out of style and each one is a hit. 

My wife stumbled upon this place and fell in love immediately. Resting at the base of a town home in a strip of other small business (Connected to the same shopping center as Wings and Rings and Blink off of Ardrey Kell) it's a perfect little bistro-esque location for breakfast. It may be a bit difficult to find for first-timers and actually find a parking space (you can always park in the bank's parking lot) but the location is very quaint and houses tons of personality. 

For those of you who appreciate waffles, you may have to dash the idea you have in your head. These are Belgian Liege style waffles. They aren't pouring batter into a piping hot waffle iron and handing out faux eggo garbage. This is a brioche type dough that is hand-pressed into a waffle iron. Filled with tons of pearl sized crystals of sugar, each bite of waffle is crunchy at first, bursting with sugar crystals and finishes with a brilliant chew. Be prepared for intrigue as many waffle aficionados tend to be. You won't think \"waffle\" immediately, but rather \"sweet bread.\" The owners have put a lot of thought into how these are prepared and their dough is no joke. 

There are different choices of toppings ranging from whipped cream, fruit, nutella, maple butter and powdered sugar. There are the occasional seasonal options on the menu but I have yet to be impressed by any. My recommendation is go au naturale. Just plain waffle to see what your taste buds will be up against. If you're looking for an added sweetness, go for the maple butter. Not too overt with maple flavor and just the right amount sogginess to add to those chewy waffles. Many of you may consider this spot as more of a \"treat,\" than a breakfast joint. It all depends on who well you can handle the sweetness of the dough. 

These guys also do coffee and espresso drinks. None of which are a draw and pale in comparison to the lead singing waffles. 

One of the coolest aspects of the shop is the old school coke machine they have in the back. You have to get quarters from the register and then open the door to the fridge-style vending machine. Note: You have to pull your bottle of coke out REALLY fast for it not to lock down on your bottle. Ask one of the employees behind the counter. They'll be able to tell you more. 

Cast Iron Waffles is a must for anyone in the Blakeney area. The business owners are great to chat with and love to hear their customers' stories. Ask to hear theirs. What a great family. Love how they are operating this little joint. 

Hear, hear for Belgian Liege waffles in south Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ok, so transpose everything I've ever said about Cast Iron Waffles and move it about 10 minutes from where I live. BOOM. Now, my favorite waffles in town are holdin' steady in South Park and boy, oh boy, does that make me one happy camper. 

Same old liege-style waffles, happy staff, hotter than lava and delicious coffee. So, so, so, so happy to see these guys expanding the brand throughout Charlotte. 

If you haven't experienced these waffles, make a trip. Hell, make two trips. I love that they have the bottled cokes made with real sugar. One of my go-tos if I'm not in the mood for coffee. If you're planning your maiden voyage for CIW, go for the naked variety. It'll give you a good idea of how to build on the basic waffle.

This location is located right next to George's in Piedmont Row. Parking in the garages or on the street. There is a bit more space than the location in Blakeney. Enough room to do a victory dance after enjoying a waffle, no doubt. 

Welcome, welcome, welcome to the neighborhood, guys! SO THRILLED to see you in South Park!"}
{"text":"Excited to see another \"breakfast\" option in South Charlotte.  Love to see the entrepeneurial spirit alive in well.  Now onto the product itself.  Personally way too sweet for my wife and I- originally we both ordered one waffle a piece and I was thinking, I'll need another.  Halfway through I was full as these are extremely rich waffles.  Limited seating."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on a Sunday around 12:30.  The place was pretty empty but the tables were dirty & the were dirty napkins on the ground, all while the workers were behind the counter talking and playing on their phones.  We cleaned our own table and ate our waffles.  When we left 30 minutes later, the place looked exactly the same as when we walked in, minus our clean table.  The waffles were okay but you can tell a lot about a restaurant that isn't kept clean."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with good chill music in the background. Came with Holly on Sunday morning before COT. I needed to refuel after a wild night... 

The waffles were just what I needed. Delicious! Really fun and friendly staff."}
{"text":"It is such a pleasure to find a fantastic local coffee shop nestled in the chain-overloaded Ballantyne area.  It is not clearly evident from the main road (Ardrey Kell) but this gem is worth looking for.  As a mom'n'pop independent coffee shop it could stand on its own, but this place has a unique claim to fame--Belgian Liege waffles.  They are completely scrumptious especially with a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The waffles can be ordered with toppings but they really stand alone.  They are dense, chewy and bursting with flavor. The waffles are sweetened with pearl sugar. I can't seem to get enough of them.  I regularly crave them for breakfast.  I would happily forgo any other breakfast--bagels, doughnuts, anything--for one of these heavenly waffles.  Though they are served with a fork and knife, I simply pick mine up with the prvided wax paper and munch it down.

This is such a fantastic treat."}
{"text":"I live in the condos here - and needed some coffee. I ran down to this spot to try it. The one girl in there was pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people, but the latte I got was really good and I got two plain waffles with no sugar to go. The waffle by itself is very sweet dough and tastes awesome without any toppings on it.

There is parking in the structure in the west building that is very convenient and there is a lot of seating in the cafe. I hear they have wifi, but I didn't try it out.

The waffles are all made early in the morning, so the earlier, the fresher."}
{"text":"Went there two days ago, heard about it on Creative Loafing.   Very friendly staff, ordered a naked waffle and hot chocolate, which I got within five minutes of ordering.  Very tasty, glad I only got one because it was very filling!  Had no trouble finding the place."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE. 

We ordered via Postmates and got the Naked Waffle, cinnamon roll waffle, slowberry cobbler waffle, sticky bun waffle, and the lumberjack waffle. 

They were all great but there's nothing like the Naked Waffle. It was the first and last bite I took. By far my favorite. You should 110% get at least one!"}
{"text":"Liege waffles! These are so different from the traditional \"Belgian\" waffles we see so often.  Liege waffles are dense and sweet and you can hold like a cookie!   

Cast Iron Waffles is a little, cute store front amongst a residential/commercial development. It's small inside so you may not be able to sit down, especially peak morning times. I like my waffle \"naked\" but you can get the deluxe version and choose fruits and toppings. 

I ordered a dozen for a work breakfast but I wanted to stretch it out a bit so I asked if they could cut them in half for me. Instead, they made 24 mini waffles for me by spliting the waffle dough in half before it went into the iron - that way they were still round. I appreciated the flexibility!

The coffee flavors here are fun and interesting. This is a great spot for a sweet-tooth breakfast with a decadent coffee!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for waffles after a trying day. They had exactly 2 left, which was our luck. Apparently they had quite the breakfast rush, it was a Saturday. The waffle was good, tasty, sweet. They were out of ingredients for the lumberjack too, so I ended up with the peanut butter cup. I typically go light on carbs but made an exception. It's probably not a place I would go back to, but it's great for its niche."}
{"text":"Los mejores waffles de Charlotte, el deluxe es mi favorito acompañado de un latte deliciosooooo!! Recomiendo comprar los congelados para llevar a casa para desayunar o para un rico y rápido postre!!"}
{"text":"I just love their Belgian waffles! So delish, but they are pretty pricey and they charge extra for toppings."}
{"text":"I have been to Cast Iron waffles several times and every time the food does not disappoint! The waffles themselves are slightly smaller than a typical Belgian but the dough/batter mix used creates a heavenly consistency and taste. The toppings are delicious! The bacon waffles, however, use some sort of bacon bits instead of the fresh crispy bacon that I would prefer. If I were grading this solely on the food, I would give it 5 stars even though it is a bit pricey (around $4 for one deluxe waffle). Service is slow and there have been several times where I have had a bit of attitude from at least one of the girls working. Parking in the plaza is difficult but not completely unmanageable. I definitely recommend you try this for a quick bite some morning!"}
{"text":"I simply love this place as I am a waffle addict.....not any waffle but the type of waffle that is carefully put together with the perfect taste....only a few places in Charlotte have the gift but this place is on another level all together because the waffles are delish and sweet......now understand that the sweetness of this waffle is on 10 so it's more of a dessert and I probably wouldn't go for breakfast again as the sweetness lingered long after I had left but that won't stop me from returning:-)"}
{"text":"I ordered a chocolate peanut butter waffle, along with some other things. On the menu it is described as a peanut butter and chocolate cream cheese. Nowhere does it say that the waffle contains Nutella. Long story short I ended up at the hospital for a serious allergic reaction. You would expect a small business to be more cautious about indicating what menu items contain nuts.

Never coming back."}
{"text":"Thanks to Ben.. Cast Iron Waffles was at the YELP event at the Fillmore.  I had a sample there, omg..... I was hooked. So sweet, nice crisp on the outside yet soft and melts when you bite into it.. The event was Friday. I had to stop by on Sunday. Couldn't get enough. I had the Deluxe waffle. It has Nutella, banana and strawberry. I was sooooooo high from the sugar afterward. I can't eat this everyday but its definitely a treat. 
In case you don't know what's so special about their waffles, well I can explain. 
Their speciality is the Belgian Liege Waffle.. The dough is thicker than regular waffles mix and it has Belgian Pearl Sugar. They smashed a pre-measured dough into a waffle iron and it create this wonderful caramelized crisp shell and soft sugary inside. Soooo good. You MUST try at least ONCE in this lifetime. 
Those waffles were so good but I wasn't too crazy about their lattes. Definitely not their speciality. Maybe next time, I'll just get a regular cup coffee..."}
{"text":"I had a friend that lived in Belgium who would bring these delectable waffles home, so I need what to expect. SUGAR, SUGAR and SUGAR. If you're expecting something else, you probably should not go here. They only have waffles, nothing else to eat. There is a wide assortment of coffee drinks. Tables are limited. It was busy on Saturday morning and there wasn't enough seating at the one off Audrey Kell. I ended up getting the triple berry waffle which was excellent. I really could of had two, but my ass told me to stop. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious waffles and great coffee. I also love to buy the frozen waffles and bring them home. So easy to warm and a super fast breakfast."}
{"text":"Very cool place and great waffles. Although very sweet, even the bacon one. Coffee's are decent but not super. All of it is overpriced and the service is ok. Pretty girl service who are expedient but not friendly."}
{"text":"Bad coffee, fake bacon, dry waffles. Only the fruit was good. This is basically a hipster coffee shop staffed by the cutest girls the manager could find. The waffles are smaller than pictures make them seem. Also, there are about four tables with no room for much else."}
{"text":"This isn't your ordinary leggo-my-eggo waffle house. They serve waffles made from a sugary and buttery confection of dough, not batter. For a newbie like me, I settled on the plain waffle and will eventually work myself up to a full loaded waffle. The plain had just enough sweet for me to handle on my initial tasting. The sugar caramelizes on the edges to form a crisp, delicious bite. If your sweet tooth gets an aching, go for the berry toppings or the one with syrup and bacon. 

Next, order up a latte! I had not seen a crispy marshmallow flavor before so heck, why not try everything new?! It was very good and they offer a bunch of different flavors in case that doesn't tickle your fancy. If you're not the coffee-going type, then will tea do? They have a nice variety of teas to choose from as well.

It is in prime location in South Park in the prestigious Piedmont Row (where the Starbucks used to be). Service was very friendly.

They also have WiFi, but don't go here thinking you're going to crank out a bunch of work. I found it a tad slow and my husband and I were the only ones in there. Maybe once they get more of a crowd, they'll bump up their internet package. Although the WiFi was their weakest link, they have lots of outlets. Oh, let me not forget to mention their very clean bathroom.

Nice to see you in the neighborhood, Cast Iron Waffles!"}
{"text":"Best waffles ever!!!! I like the deluxe the best... It comes with strawberries bananas Nutella and whipped cream! Oh and the coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"A good, unique place semi fast food that's experiencing some new-restaurant growing pains. 

Food is good, but they seem slightly too stuck up to make concessions for those that ask for them. For example, their waffles are made with dough, not batter, so it's naturally sweet. Because of this, they don't serve waffles with butter or syrup. End if story, no exceptions. 

Other small nit picks, utensils aren't served with the plate, you have to go to the coffee bar to get them. 

Great food, good potential, annoying growing pains."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to check this place out. The service was exceptional! Really friendly and informative. Decided on a Coconut Milk Latte (yes, they have milk alternatives...hooray!) and a Slowberry Waffle. I could be remembering the name incorrectly but it's the waffle topped with a sort of jam made from slow cooked berries, powdered sugar and whipped cream. It was delicious. The waffle itself is sweet enough to eat alone but very tasty with the jam and whipped cream.
  My only critique is that I would have preferred a warm jam since the name mentions it is slow cooked; I misinterpreted that as it was warm. Either way, it was delicious! 
People like to compare these waffles to typical Belgium waffles and they don't realize these are Belgium-Leige. Trust me, they are good! 
They also offer a loyalty punch card so you can earn a free coffee or waffle after 9 punches."}
{"text":"This would have been a five star review except for the mediocre experiences I've had here the past few times I've come. 

The waffles are now inconsistent with big pieces of sugar still not mixed in and the waffles are now more likely to be served from a drawer, rather than straight from the waffle iron, even when there is not a crowd. 

Toppings are tasty, the tea selection is fun, but seating is limited and I'm not interested in picking huge sugar clumps out of my waffle when I eat it. 

I wish my experiences were consistent and I keep coming back in hopes things will get better again, but they haven't."}
{"text":"What? The waffles have chunks of sugar in them? What?!?!

This is officially the best place ever.

I never thought I'd love a waffle until I tried the waffles here.  You may be detered by the small size of the waffles in the showcase.  But really, the waffle itself is pretty heavy, and it only gets heavier by adding on toppings (which is a must).  So it's actually the perfect size.  By the end of my first waffle, I felt like I was borderline hyperglycemia diabetic.  Perfectly borderline. 

Definitely try to check in and get their deals if they're offering.  I paid 5$ for my waffle including powdered sugar, nutella, strawberries, and whipped cream.  

Not only is the food good, the place itself is like a cute cafe with small tables and outside seating.  On a nice day, I wouldn't mind my party running late so I can chill on the shaded tables outside."}
{"text":"Finally tried it for the first time this morning and it was yummy! We ordered 3 waffles thinking they looked small. We definitely over ordered! The waffles are rich, sweet and dense. One waffle is plenty! We got the berries and cream, the cinnamon pecan and lumber jack. I preferred my berries and cream since it was a bit lighter compared to the other two but all were great. Will definitely be back! Cute little neighborhood feel with great coffee as well."}
{"text":"Simple little hide away cafe for breakfast, snack, or hot beverage in South Park. WiFi,  TV, friendly staff, great waffles, earned it 4 stars from me. Would of been 5 stars, but paid $4 for a to go waffle which only had 5-6 slices of strawberries on top."}
{"text":"The chicks here know how to make so damn good waffles and look great while doing it unlike back home. 10/10 definitely stopping  by here again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. The waffles are delicious and the espresso is amazing. The prices are great, too! Highly recommend the deluxe waffle with strawberries and bananas. I used to think that nothing compared to my father's homemade recipe, but this sure is a solid contender."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Small, quaint shop serving unique waffles - but not regular waffles. These are Belgium waffles - more dense and sweet than an American waffle. They're more like pastry. 
Only downside might be plastic plates and utensils. That said we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The good:
Nice atmosphere
Great waffles
Reasonably priced

The bad:
Not really visible from the main road
Few tables"}
{"text":"I tried their deluxe waffle with nutella, chocolate syrup, fruit, and whipped cream. It's been said by other reviewers but worth repeating, this isn't your standard waffle. More chewy and thick than standard waffles, almost the texture of cake. This isn't a light breakfast, be prepared for a rich, heavy tour-de-force that will take a couple of hours to recover from. Very indulgent and certainly not a low calorie venture. But it's worth the treat as long as you realize that your productivity will plummet in the afternoon. Their atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the smell of coffee mixed with waffles can instantly lift your mood when you walk in. The caramel macchiatos are great too."}
{"text":"We live walking to distance to Cast Iron (over at LaVie) and this is one of our weekly spots! We usually stop by to grab coffee before work, and also frequent this spot on the weekends. The waffles are great and come in a variety of flavors. There is also outdoor seating with a wide sidewalk, so it's great for bringing the dog and just enjoying a nice day. We love Cast Iron!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant. Very small place, it wasn't busy so this was great!  The only reason for the four stars is because my husband thought they were small. The size was fine for me. I had the cobbler waffle and it was amazing!! I happen to like table service but all in all I was very happy and we will return."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this little neighborhood waffle and coffee joint. On all three of my visits, it was jam-packed with eager waffle enthusiasts. The menu is limited but what they do, they do well. Seating is available inside and out but, be aware, it is very limited.

The waffles are tasty but are a little too sweet and dessert-like for my middle aged palate, and that becomes even more the case once powdered sugar, fresh fruit and/or Nutella are added. Nevertheless, I do enjoy dropping in from time to time and compensate somewhat by going sugar-free in my coffee and passing on the sweet toppings. One is my limit though.

Overall, I think this place is a Gotta Try, at least once. Just get there early to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Waffles are tough and almost stale tasting. Also the waffle dough has more of a doughnut taste to it, not what I was looking for. If you're going to have a business solely dedicated to waffles (only food they serve) I would expect those waffles to be pretty damn good. Idk if it's because maybe they are frozen not fresh but whatever they're doing is not working."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and efficient. The idea is great. The waffles were ok. The hot drinks were good. There is something missing. It felt like it should have been in an amusement park. Paid $21 with tip. I don't want to sound like a snob but. I don't like eating off cheap plastic plates with cheap plastic utensils and the absolutely cheapest napkins sold.  Glad I went to try it but not real anxious to go back."}
{"text":"Great place which highlights what the waffle should be.  Quick, convenient, great price and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Cast Iron Waffles! I'm addicted to their naked waffle. I love that I can buy frozen waffles in bulk."}
{"text":"I'm honored to write the first review for this location as it just had it's soft opening today.  I was walking by after dinner and was invited in for some coffee and dessert.  With it being too close to bedtime, I passed on the coffee but could not resist ordering a peanut butter cup Belgian waffle to go. 

Even in a to go box, the waffle was beautiful with peanut butter and Nutella drizzled artistically over the top and the whipped cream mindfully placed in a separate plastic cup with a lid.  The whole ensemble was placed in a plastic bag with extra napkins and a fork and knife.  I'm always surprised how many restaurants fail to include little things like that. 

Since they have some cute bistro tables and free wifi, I ended up opening up my bag and staying a bit to enjoy my waffle in the cool summer air outside.  The waffle was crisp, flavorful, and the toppings only made it better.  I can also see how they say you can eat it naked (no toppings).  Being a Nutella junkie, if I see it on a menu, I have to order it. They had an offering with bacon which I just might have to try next go around.

The owner, Art, personally came out to greet me and we chatted a bit about the lack of real coffee shops in the area.  Living within walking distance, I am very pleased to not only find a small (non chain) coffee shop in my area, but one that serves amazing and reasonably priced breakfast.  My peanut butter cup waffle was a bit over $5 but that's less than I can get out for one drink at other (green international chain) coffee shops.

I'm looking forward to trying other waffles (maybe the maple cream and bacon one) on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I came here based on some pretty strong recommendations of local friends. Cast iron waffles is an interesting entity. I expected more of a dine-in restaurant but it's arranged more like a swift-service, quick brunch snack shop. Yes I just said \"brunch snack.\"  While the food didn't impress, it didn't entirely disappoint either. Can you see why I'm stuck at 3 stars??  The waffles were obviously pre-made which is something I'd expect from fast-food chain instead of upscale almost boutique looking shop like the one in South Park (although in their defense they do have 4 locations).  I think them not being made fresh impacted my experience heavily. I'm familiar with liege style waffles and expected a doughy sweeter waffle, and that's what I got. However, despite I was the only one in the place at the time, my waffle was only slightly warm and was much more dry than I expected. I couldn't decide on what types to get so the barista made me a half Cinnamon roll, half Lumberjack (sweet and salty : bacon and buttercream) waffle. The cinnamon roll side was obviously the winner and I'd get it again - almost like a huge Cinnamon Toast Crunch chunk lol. The bacon on the lumberjack half was a little too chewy to make me go for it again. Either way, service was with a smile and the prices were more than fair + you get a dollar off your waffle or latte with Yelp checkin. I'd come here again, but definitely not make a special trip out of the way for what they have to offer.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars for the waffles because they are awesome. We lived in Belgium for a number of years and these are very reflective of the desert type of waffle that you can get there. The reason I am only giving three stars is I found service to be a bit unfriendly and the coffee was really not good at all. What I would say to the people who run the cash register is, just smile it's not that hard and don't act like you're doing the customers a favor by being there!  We are patrons and patrons pay your salary!  
I've been here a couple of times and both times parking has been an issue. So come prepared with parking patience!  
Again, for my taste and compared to what we used to get in Europe, I think the waffles are awesome!"}
{"text":"The waffles were good but the service could have been much better. My family and I went here for breakfast. My daughter got the waffle with chocolate chips, I got the deluxe with strawberries and bananas and my husband got the cinnamon roll. All three were good but sadly, they are only getting two stars because of their service. 
When we got there, we ordered our food, the girl taking our order sounded like she would rather be somewhere else. She was not pleasant and was almost rude...pretty blah and that's not great since she's the first person customers see. After waiting for almost 25 minutes...we got our drinks but we're still waiting. We noticed that they were just cleaning so we asked them about our order. My husband gave them our receipt which had two parts, the order and actual receipt. He had accidentally taken it after the girl taking our order walked away without giving him a receipt after we ordered. The girl apologized and said that was what they needed to make the order and that it would take a few minutes. The girl who took our order should have noticed since we were just sitting there waiting and there was only one customer after us. She played dumb apparently. Anyhow, one of the girls (blond and shorter) approached and asked us if we wanted extra toppings for our order or a drink, we passed since we had toppings and drinks. I told her how the girl who took our order should have noticed and how she was kind of rude, she asked which one...the one with the nose ring?  I pointed the girl out, she was taller, had brown hair, was wearing a gray hoodie, and was just waking out from the back room. When the girl walked back, she asked what was wrong and I overheard her saying that she didn't even talk to us. She was the one who took our order, maybe she shouldn't be working at a place that deals with customer service as she is not good at it. 
Overall a bad experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Coffee? Check. Most delicious waffles in the world? Check. Carb coma? Check check. 

This was hubs and my second time here and I'm sad I waited so long. I forgot how amazing just the aroma of Cast Iron is as soon as you open the door. Then there's their menu. All of the combinations of toppings that you can put on your waffle are amazing. From fresh fruit to Oreos, or just a \"naked\" waffle, they got you. The coffee is also amazing. 

They have indoor and outdoor seating and cute little nooks to enjoy your waffles in. The staff both times were super friendly and seem to enjoy you enjoying your waffle. One would definitely be enough, but since hubs and I are fatties living in skinny bodies, we each ordered two and put ourselves into carb comas. 5 stars and will be returning."}
{"text":"I call myself a breakfast connoisseur cause I'm obsessed with all things breakfast food and this place did not disappoint! Though the seating options are limited we were able to grab 2 spots at the bar. The waffles were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the other ones they offer! As I mentioned above the seating is tight, so if I had to pick something they could improve it would be additional seating, but other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this place i guess they were about to close, because our service there was lousy. Asked the waitress if the waffles were fresh, she stated they were. Because they were cooked sometime today she stated. I believe they were bought from Sam's  Club or something. I believe Sam's waffles are much better. My wife liked them, I felt that they were dry and not even warm"}
{"text":"Very intimate, cafe style waffle & coffee shop in Ballantyne area that serves some delicious waffles. The Lumberjack was a maple & BACON topped Belgium waffle which was delicious. I'd recommend trying the waffles out. The price was inexpensive and cup of Joe was on point. 

Downside: This waffle which can be a little difficult to slice into under normal circumstances should not be served on a plastic saucer with plastic knife & fork. Totally confused. But hey everything can't be perfect in the world of cheap waffles & coffee. 

I'd still go back and enjoy another waffle!"}
{"text":"These waffles are perfect as they are. No sugar, syrup, or other toppings necessary. I know the options are tempting, but trust me on this one. Get a plain waffle and enjoy the simple indulgence while avoiding a sugar crash later."}
{"text":"I thought I loved waffles before, and then I had a Cast Iron waffle.  

I'm not sure if those little crunchy pieces are crack or just sugar, but they make these waffles amazing.  It's not your typical waffle, that's for sure.  The dough is more dough-like, making these more like a Brioche than a waffle batter.  

Since it was my first time eating Cast Iron, I chose to go with a plain waffle with a bit of whipped cream.  I say a bit, but what came out was more like a softball sized dollop of fresh whipped cream.  I'm glad I went plain because I tried the bacon maple waffle that my sister got, and while it was incrediblely flavorful, I was much happier with the simplicity that my waffle offered.  We ate fairly early in the morning so we didn't have any issues with the freshness of our waffles.    

We ordered a bunch of waffles to go so we could heat them up as dessert later in the week.  We accidentally ordered fresh instead of frozen waffles so I was worried they would get gummy or not re-heat well, but after 10 or so minutes in the oven, they came out perfectly fine.  

I noticed Yelp says they're closed.  I'm really hoping that's not the case because I'm going to need more Cast Iron waffles in my near future."}
{"text":"This place has great food and even better service. I stop in occasionally on my way into the office and grab a quick bite and a coffee. Always a pleasant experience which is harder to find these days. Much better than Starbucks, spend local!"}
{"text":"By far the best waffles I have ever had and I love the smoothies there. Also great and friendly staff. Customer for life!"}
{"text":"HOLY BAJEEZUS! Replace \"bajeezus\" with a four-letter expletive and that's exactly what I said after I took a bite from their waffle at the Yelp party last night. It was fantastic! BEST WAFFLE IVE EVER HAD! I couldn't control myself. \"MMMM\" and \"Oh that is DELICIOUS\" are my normal reactions to good food. But \"Holy _ _ _ _,\" now that's somethin' serious! 

It's not your traditional Denny's waffle. It's a completely different style & is VERY sweet without being overly sweet. Before cooking it, they throw some sugar pearls in with the batter which caramelize, creating a wonderfully chewy treat. I tried it with the maple butter & strawberries... my imagination could not have possibly conjured up a more perfect combination! 

I also went online to check out their full menu. I was expecting these wonderful concoctions to cost like $10. The \"deluxe\" waffle which is what the one I got would be characterized as, was only $4.50 (i think). It didn't appear from their menu that they offer anything but waffles & beverages but I'd make that trip. It was amazing. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, subpar waffles.  There a dozens of better places for a quick breakfast in South Park.  Even Waffle House has better service and ingredients without the high prices."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since the sign went up.

Great inside decor - very warm and welcoming. A good place to hang out.

Short menu - it is indeed all about the coffee and waffles. On the latter, the waffles are unlike any you've probably had, more rich and very sweet. In talking briefly with the owners it's due to the mix, the increased butterfat, and their use of pearl sugar. Overall, these are excellent portable waffles that are very sweet. A decedent treat.

Coffee-wise, no complaints - had the dark roast and it was great.

I really hope this place survives because South Ballantyne needs a local coffeehouse instead of only chains!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with the bonus of waffles. Small and cozy inside. Perfect size for a big snack as you get 1 waffle with your choice of toppings or choose from pre made combos. Waffles are made right there and are thick and chewy with just a little bit of crunch. The coffee is delicious too."}
{"text":"Love love love the waffles here!!! Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because the young lady working was very rude the afternoon we went in to eat. Closing was in 20 minutes and she definitely made us aware. Despite this , I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The coffees were fantastic we had a couple of mocha's and like some have noted, I'm sure there seems to have been a bit more sugar than some other places, but hell if you're ordering a mocha in the first place, are we really overly concerned about sugar, because it made them taste amazing.... Anyhow, that was great, the waffles were fantastic - Love how they have some pictures of the different kinds and types you can get, because the menu was a little confusing.  They also happened to be having a 'Random act of kindness' donation/discount deal while we were there, for awareness of Human trafficking and gave $5 off of our $20 order, which was great, so we actually researched it a little more and donated $10 to a local Human trafficking organization, so kudos to them on their goal to bring awareness.  They succeeded here, and we'll be back for more coffee and waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is so sweet! It's located in the bottom floor of a townhouse, so not easily found, but totally worth the drive once you get there. No need to bother with fruit or toppings for your waffles, although everything is fresh and delicious. The waffles themselves have the pearl sugar in the dough so they are sweet and tasty on their own. The staff is friendly if only a tad inexperienced and first timers tend to need a bit of navigation on the straightforward menu(its almost confusing since there are no major choices to be made). Super yummy and worth the drive out to the south Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"love this place, probably too much. The waffles are amazing just by themselves, but you are doing yourself a real disservice  if you don't get one of their many deluxe waffles. The staff was very friendly and my orders are always accurate and consistently great. Their ice mixed drinks really make their drink selection shine. get the pistachio one, then prepare to hooked for multiple visits."}
{"text":"We felt we were back in Brussels. They were delicious. I want to go back and try some of the other choices on the menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"Needed spot in piedmont row. Stopped in to grab coffee which was excellent. Staff was friendly and it was clean"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I promise. I keep going with hopes it will be like my first time at the Ballantyne location, or even as good as the small bite I got at the yelp event they were at. But all 3 times I've been to the Southpark location they have served me a cold \"reheated\" waffle. My chocolate chips don't even melt :( I have yet to go  and see more than one other person there so I'm not quite sure why the extra couple of minutes to make a fresh HOT waffle would be a big deal. I inquired about their process and was told they make them fresh in the morning and reheat them but if I'm going to actually pay for a waffle I want to watch it being made. Otherwise I can reheat my own from the store. 
Also, inconsistency with the hours that they are open. Everything says 9 until you get there to see they changed it to 7?"}
{"text":"We live nearby and have been wanting to try the Cast Iron Waffles foe a while. We walked in at 8:30-am on a Monday after a holiday. One other customer there., otherwise empty. The person behind the counter did not acknowledge us, even after we said \"good morning\" We waited for four-five minutes and walked out as no one seemed interested in helping us. We went across the street to Panera Bread (which was packed) and had a great breakfast experience. Don't know who owns Cast Iron Waffles, but they certainly don't have their eye on the business."}
{"text":"I visited Cast Iron Waffles recently and I have to say that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I thought it was a breakfast place where you could waffles, eggs, bacon, etc.  Instead, it is more like a coffee shop that happens to serve waffles.

With that being said, the waffles are absolutely delicious.  I had a naked one, which obviously has nothing on it, and it was so very tasty.  I also tried the cinnamon roll waffle which was way too good.  To me, the waffles seem more like a dessert than breakfast though.  So, I'm pretty sure I when I go from now on (and I definitely will be going often), it will be when I'm wanting a cup of coffee and have a sweet tooth, rather than a breakfast meal."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in Cast Iron Waffles. Part of my disappointment is in myself for choosing this place without knowing much about it. My wife and I were coming to the Southpark area to visit a family member who had recently moved there. I saw this place on Yelp. It looked interesting, and I chose it over some other breakfast places like Flying Biscuit and Original Pancake House. Bad choice. It didn't look promising when we walked in just before noon (they're open til 3 PM) and there were was one other party (two people) in the place. When we saw that the place was essentially just waffles and coffee, we debated whether to walk back across the roundabout and go to Terrace Cafe to get a proper breakfast/brunch. We decided to stay and give it a shot.

I got a maple buttercream bacon waffle, and my wife got a plain waffle with powdered sugar. When I inquired about syrup, I was told \"we don't have syrup, our \"belgian liege\" waffles are sweet enough without them.\" True enough for my waffle with the buttercream topping, but not so much for my wife's naked waffle. And I'm pretty sure I read other reviews in which other people had gotten syrup for an extra charge. Anyway, whatever. We were in a bit of hurry so we finished our waffles and coffee and left. The girl who served us was the only visible employee during our visit, and she asked half-heartedly \"how was everything?\" literally as we were walking out the door. 

In fairness, my waffle was pretty good with the bacon and maple buttercream topping. However, their \"naked\" waffle is not savory or sweet enough (despite what the employee claimed) to stand on its own without syrup or some other topping. The coffee was pretty good also. I would advise anyone thinking about eating here to adjust their expectations... this isn't a breakfast place. If you substitute waffles for doughnuts or other pastries, its essentially a coffee shop. I fully acknowledge that I didn't educate myself enough going in. However, the overall experience was disappointing enough even if I had known more about the place. If you want a coffee specialty drink, it's probably a good spot. But if you're looking for breakfast, there are plenty of better options in the Southpark area."}
{"text":"Okay, really great waffles.. To eat for dessert or if you are just craving for something super sweet.

Place - A small quaint cafe, tucked in the corner, next to George's Brasserie on your left. So make sure to go around the roundabout fountain, and veer to the left and find your parking spot.

Food - Only serves waffles, coffee, tea... No eggs! I had the bacon waffle special. It was cloyingly sweet and was not good  for breakfast, which was what I did. I thought maybe they would serve some eggs. Maybe they will in the future. 

They make their waffles ahead of time, to be efficient. I don't mind. 

Price - It was mediocre. Not bad for a cafe place.

If I were to come back, I would only consider this place for after dinners, or a get together with the girls for some sweet night/day. My rating would really be three and a half stars but if you round it up, it's a four!"}
{"text":"These waffles are the BEST!! There is not  a lot of seating so I wouldn't bring a big group here, but it's good for a group of 2-4.  You order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  It has a coffee house feel to it."}
{"text":"Liege waffles are awesome and coffee is good too. I've never had them before and now prefer over the regular waffles.  They are denser but have have a great sugary, crisp crust and sugar pieces inside. The place is small cafe style so not great to go to for a family breakfast out, but you can get it to go or get frozen waffles for home. I definitely recommend this place, we go quite often since we live so close by."}
{"text":"Liege waffles - thank God for Belgium!  These sinful waffles are so good and if you pour the warm maple butter over It?  Hold on, I had to regain my composure, but you add that maple butter, omg!!  
We had the naked and the slowberry waffles (5/5) and, the crispness of the waffle caused by the pearls of sugar embedded in the dough, I got one word for ya: DAMMNN!! 
Not a big operation but the service is good and folks were friendly (5/5).
The restaurant itself is small but comfortable and the ambiance is nice (5/5).
Google Liege for businesses near you or buy a ticket and fly to Charlotte and get you some!!"}
{"text":"Waffles are very tasty, Coffee is Good.  However who ever rated this with 1 $ is nuts.  Place is pricey.  My wife and i each had 1 cup of coffee and 1 waffle a piece and it was nearly $20.   I'll def go back, but not as often as I'd like, Wheaties are way cheaper."}
{"text":"We had driven past Cast Iron Waffles many times but had never stopped. Today we decided to see what it was all about and boy are we glad we did. 

The waffles were great (try the Deluxe Waffle) but more importantly the owners and staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel right at home. 

Great locally owned business - We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"The place is small and cute, lots of locals. Kids enjoyed hot chocolate, waffles were delicious! We tried seasonal pumpkin cream waffle, Nutella waffle and peanut butter waffle. All three were good, maybe pumpkin was the least flavorful and really did not taste like pumpkin to me. But all in all it was great and we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and original waffles, quaint and funky."}
{"text":"Holy Waffle Gods! This is not your grandmas waffle iron, local IHOP , pancake house Waffle House waffle. They are thick, rich, sweet and not for the faint of heart. The feels I'm having eating this gloriousness! This is soooooooo worth the holiday traffic hell to get here. I don't think I want another regular style Belgian waffle. The sweetness and the brioche thickness texture are just amazeballs. I'm so hooked! This will be my cheat day spot for a while."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cast Iron Waffles, at both locations, for a few years. I was happy to see that this location had reopened
But...

The change in the way an iced mocha is made will make me stop coming here. They used to be made with their cold pressed Toddy, and now apparently they make their mochas just like EVERY OTHER coffee place in the world.

Boring.

You can only get one ounce of toddy if you get a 20 ounce mocha and they still cram espresso into it. Talk about missing the point.

Talk about a waste of $4. 

I would normally rave about the waffles, but I am not too disappointed to bother."}
{"text":"Waffle was decent, but that the only option on the menu. Coffee is about average. Place was basically empty on a Saturday morning, a testament in and of itself. My issue was the service was terrible. Preferred to talk about their social lives then explain to customers what's on the menu & poured the wrong coffee (Hot not Iced). Not Into the whole customer service thing... Then ask for an optional tip."}
{"text":"Literally the best waffle I've ever had. And it was really well priced. I've been thinking about it since I ate it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to sample one of these delectable bites of waffley goodness and I must say---- Best Waffle EVER!!!!  They are not your normal batter waffles.  This is \"brioche dough\" ....I think :)   Anyway, best thing I have ever had for a breakfast sweet treat!!!  I can't WAIT for them to open in the Piedmont Town Center......YAY!!!!  I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Delicous waffles and coffee. Easy going location with casual benches outside so my friend and I could chat uninterrupted. They brought our waffles to us and the waffles themselves were topped with a generous amount of whipped cream and yummy combinations of flavors."}
{"text":"Last year my husband and I stayed at an inn over a little waffle restaurant in Savannah. They made authentic Belgium liege waffles and they were amazing. You could experience the slightly crisp exterior and fluffy interior even with an abundance of toppings. That being said, the waffles we had today at Cast Iron Waffles were nothing like those delicious beauties. 

There were 2 other patrons in the restaurant when we arrived. After waiting at the counter for about 5 minutes we were helped. There were 2 people working but only one out front, so we waited while she prepared waffles and coffee. It would have made more sense for her to take our order so we could sit and then start making all the food. 

The waffles we received were not good at all. Nothing like those amazing waffles we had in Savannah. These were super dense, chewy and tasted like raw dough inside. There was no crunchy exterior. None of us finished our waffles."}
{"text":"Visited Cast Iron Waffles for the first time.  The staff was friendly and it was a cozy place to grab a great coffee.  The waffles were tasty as my husband and I had the Naked Waffle and we added the powdered sugar for a nice sweet taste.  We also had a mocha latte which was a winner with me as they used Ghiradelli Chocolate with a fresh strong espresso.  

The seating at the location wasn't plentiful and we got our meal to go.  There is a small outdoor seating area, however it was raining today so that was not an option.  Overall, it was a nice place to try and we would try their other options as well."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. I have been here 4 times and each time the waitstaff has been sullen and curt. They say no pleasantries but act as if they would rather there be less work and fewer customers.  It is always hot and rather gloomy inside. It is not a happy environment. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The waffles are good and the place itself is adorable. The service, however, is very unfortunate. On my first trip, I came in to pick up a to go order. My waffles weren't ready yet, and after telling me this, the two young women turned their back to me, leaned against the counter, and stared up at the wall-mounted television until the waffle iron let them know my order was ready. 

Don't expect any kind of service after they drop off your order if you're dining in. They use disposable plates and utensils, which are clearly cheap. I have visited several times and have consistently received service you would expect from a bored sorority girl. 

With training and a dedication to making a customer feel welcome, this place could be great. For now, though, not so much."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. Daughter of owners is extremely rude and gives horrible customer service. Refused to accept coupon for a buy one get one free. Called \"mommy\" which ended up being daddy (owner) who then cursed me out with several \"F\" bombs then threatened to call police. Would not recommend at all. Go to a bagel shop. Way better customer service."}
{"text":"Waffles were OK at best.  It was closer to cold than warm.  The person I was with had the peanut butter cup waffle.  The chocolate chips didn't even melt.  Most of the tables were dirty and the place was empty.  I'd be surprised if this restaurant is in business six month from now.  The staff, however, was friendly and helpful.  

(I also had a single shot of espresso - it was sour).  

I won't go back unless I see a number of very positive reviews."}
{"text":"Free wi-fi with a decent speed! Busy on weekends,hard to find a seat.

Amazing corner location just like star bucks and a wonderful neighborhood :)


Got a text message on the second morning of the recent snow storm that they're open.What a relief !!! 

Saw the text message and started walking in the storm towards the coffee shop..it was an adventurous hike...... 



Wondering about the distance:I live next door ;) Haha"}
{"text":"My wife loves it here. Employees are very friendly, coffee is ok, and the waffles are basically like desserts. A little too sweet for me but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique!  I had the cinnamon roll waffle and my friend had the pumpkin pie waffle.  I am a sweet fiend, so I was in heaven with my choice and probably could've eaten all of hers as well.  While I do understand their Belgian street food concept, I think that adding a few savory options like an egg and cheese or a turkey bacon and cheese would appeal to american customers more, and would attract more business.  I observed several couples come in and leave when they realized there were only sweet options."}
{"text":"Went for quick breakfast solo at 8am.  

Setting - Simple location, somewhat sterile and bordering on warm.  Nice bar seating a window tables.  Tucked in the west corner of Piedmont Row shops.  Parking was easy in the adjacent parking deck.

Food - They have waffles.  The waffles, being pre-made earlier, don't really have that freshness.  The consistency goes slightly chewy.  But dang, the offering are a diabetics worst nightmare.  Maple, bacon, quadruple berry, chocolate everything.  I just wanted a waffle with some fruit, so I went with the berry.  It was kind of a compote, with really think syrup.  My teeth just itched.  And I don't need the dollop of whipped cream to be bigger than the waffle.  
This was dessert, not breakfast.
Coffee was alright.

Service - It was empty, so I got prompt service, and received my food at the counter in about 4 minutes.  I wouldn't go so far as to see the employee was warm or engaging, but hey, they weren't rude.

Price - $7.50 for a waffle the size of my hand and a cup of coffee.  Not outrageous.

I'm glad I went to check it out, but I'll stick to Original Pancake House or Terrace Cafe."}
{"text":"Belgian Liege Waffles.  Wow.  Never had them before, but they were so great that I left with a dozen frozen ones for later!  These waffles are made from a dough, not a batter, and the dough has to be hand pressed into the waffle iron.  So unique.  The Deluxe Waffle with Nutella, Strawberries, Bananas, and Whipped Cream ... is absolutely DIVINE!  Must try one! (or maybe two, three, or four of them!)

There was a line waiting to order, and a wait for first-come-first-served seating.  Trivial.  I'd wait an hour or more for one of these waffles, and stand on the curb outside in the rain to eat it!  This is a seriously good treat!

Can I give this place six stars?"}
{"text":"I recently spent a couple of days in Charlotte for work, and once again was able to visit Cast Iron Waffles for some decadent Belgian Liege Waffles.  These are not your Eggos or quick and dirty offerings from Waffle House and the like.  Nope.  These are high pearl sugar content, caramelized pastries made on a very special constant temperature griddle.  They are then topped with various toppings like Nutella, fresh fruit, whipped cream, and so on ... the one topping missing?  Syrup.  But you neither want it, or need it.

So having already developed a jones for these waffles ... I was pleasantly surprised that Cast Iron Waffles now had more than one location!  Yippee!  And one of them was only three miles from my hotel, rather than having to schlep halfway across the city to the wonderful (but remote, for me) original location.

When I visited, the café was spotlessly clean, the staff were pleasant and quick to serve, and not only did I stuff myself there ... I took home a package of 12 frozen waffles for the family!  They love them, too.  Funny stickers on the bag of frozen waffles tell you how to gently heat them for best effect, warn against the crime of using a microwave, and even suggest that it is illegal to use a microwave on these waffles in Belgium.  Funny, but we duly followed the instructions at home, and had a product exactly the same in terms of crispiness ... as we would have received in the store.  I guess these folks really know what they are doing! 

Five thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Oh my...this place was just fantastic.  Not sure why, but I was expecting more of a restaurant, but this is more like a coffee shop that happens to serve incredibly good waffles.  Upon the suggestion of the lovely lady up front, I ordered mine just plain, to see what this waffle had to offer on its own merits.  I don't regret it.  It's nothing like a waffle that you're used to.  It's much denser, like cake almost, and has a sweetness on its own such that it doesn't really even require syrup.  

Luckily I had a wife and friend with me, though, who ordered one dressed up with Nutella, so I got to try that one too.  The coffee was fantastic as well, and I look forward to coming back at some point."}
{"text":"Checked them out at the ballantyne location yesterday. Really enjoyed the crispy, butter-less waffle with icing and cinnamon (i forget the name of it). Cappuccino wasnt that bad either. Very small place, four or five tables inside, a few outside. Didnt feel crapmed at all and was pretty cozy. The girl that served me was very pleasant, I will definitely stop in again when I'm working on this side of town."}
{"text":"I went to the Ballantyne location yesterday morning (seperate review for that location). My oldest daughter has been asking me to check it out because she wanted to go their on our date night. The Ballantyne location closes at 4pm, so we decided to go to the Southpark location, which as the website says, closes at 9pm. We show up about 715, see the neon \"OPEN\" sign turned on, and all the lights inside turned on, but the door is locked. A facially pierced young man opens the door and explains that they are starting to close around 7 now. I explained our situation, disappointed daughter in tow, and he half heartedly apologizes and offers if he can get me anything... I still dont know what that means.. if they are closed, they are closed. We came there to sit down and enjoy some time together. 
So I am posting one star for the lame attitude, for NOT turning off the bright neon open sign (was still on at 8pm when we walked by later) how hard is it to shut off lights? Also for not posting on the web that your hours are changing, that doesnt take too long either, and for disappointing my little girl. That was really a bummer."}
{"text":"The place has no 'personality'.
I am a huge fan of waffles, authentic or not. I used GOOGLE and searched for 'Waffles in Charlotte'. 
Along with other places, the search yielded Cast Iron Waffles. Sounded good, so I gave it a try. 
I called the number listed no less than 7 times, no answer. Silly me, I thought 'Wow they are so busy they cannot answer the phone'. I arrived 40 mins later to an almost vacant but nice looking place that definitely had a 'coffeehouse' feel. 
The staff did not acknowledge me or my friend. We stood at the door a few moments before we realized the staff was not going to say Hello or offer to help. 
We walked over to the counter and ordered flavored coffee and plain waffle for me. Bacon topped waffle and medium coffee for my friend. Reasonably priced. 
A few minutes later I looked in horror when the waitress brought our order over in flimsy paper thin plates with cheap/flimsy plastic ware. The presentation was awful! My flavored coffee served in a run-of-the-mill styrofoam (not coffee mug) cup was decent. The waffles?? THESE CANNOT BE AUTHENTIC BELGIAN WAFFLES! You would do better to go to the local IHOP for waffles. The waffle was lukewarm, dry, and albeit very sweet, taste as though it was pre-made. The bacon was artificial bacon bits at best, or a a bacon-like product. 
I mentioned to the waitress that I called numerous times. She said she did not know the phone number but would have someone check the line. She later told me to look at the door and that is where I could find the number.
I would not recommend this place for waffles. Coffee? Only if you are in the area and not particular about coffee etiquette."}
{"text":"Kesha (sp) has the best service and she's new. Or newer.  Don't forget to get a frequent/LOYALTY punch card.

The smells are nice as you go through the mall. 

A sample is what sold me. I figured this was more like the traditional Sunday Brunch waffle type and never cared for such outside of brunch so that's why I stayed away. However, the sample had a crunch that told me this is different so I started to research and review the place. 

I learned of the styles and batter mix. I talked to the workers and was told the crunch is a ball of sugar. I'm not the sweet tooth lady but when the mood strikes - I want something and for that, I can recommend Cast Iron. 

I tried the biscotti type yesterday and it may work for others but solidified my top choices would simply be Lumberjack = Bacon & a syrup & the Slow Clobber which inlcudes berries that are sweet and tart to balance the sweetness of the waffle. 

I've read reviews from their original location and people complained it's too sweet. I must say - the kid pointed out how sweet this item is but continued to munch on. I personally didn't notice this waffle to be overly sweet via the sample or the Clobber kind. I look forward to getting the bacon style once it's clear to me if the bacon is freshly prepared or from a pre-packaged purchased item. This won't impact my choice to try it but will either lower or raise my expectations - that's all. 

Also, I saw this from a local CLT list/group: Note to Owner and thought it would be useful to include on certain reviews such as this. So here goes, 
Note to the Owners: 

Hey Y'all, 
I'm glad you all opened this type of cafe and I can see it going over well in places that I have lived and visited. I do want to highlight your manager at the original location (I believe Crystal) was prompt and professional in addressing my gift card request via our phone calls yesterday. Keisha (Pineville) was supremely a great choice in hiring. Although she is new - it would not be known because of her lack of skill or knowledge. Instead, she's poised, knowledgeably confident and represents the company well with service above par. It shows that she likes her job and I must say she is an asset to your team. 

I understand running a small home grown business is hard work and it's like birthing then rearing a baby so I get that when someone rates you with a lower star rating or make light of their experience or speak negatively that it can touch a nerve. I will say, your responses are judged/will be judged harder than anything a reviewer writes. In all honesty, it can be a turn off. So trust your product and team will continue doing things well and for the times they don't then do as you have written and make it a teachable moment to retrain. Just note that you reprimand a reviewer it doesn't always sit well. It's okay to speak your peace but not everyone will see it as intended. In short, you can't please everyone; yet continue to do what you do best and accept everything w/o taking it personal. 

To your continued success and growth!
Ms. Joyce."}
{"text":"I LOVE these waffles and any time we have guests staying with us from out of town, we take them here! We also have a family tradition of eating birthday breakfasts here. 
I REALLY wish they offered almond milk as a milk alternative since I can't have soy (I'd stop in a lot more often) but the waffles alone are worth visiting this cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"Although the waffles & coffee items are pretty good, this is not the best place to meet up with friends. They get 1 star for beyond below customer service. Visit date: Dec. 2 2017."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying the new waffle & coffee shop since they opened... finally got around to stopping by this past weekend. Twice! That should tell you I really enjoyed my first visit.

I'm not sure if Cast Iron is more of a coffee shop or a waffle shop. The owner said proudly she thought they were both! I think she may be right. They have a ton of coffee, latte & tea options. Their espresso machine was down during my first visit, but the iced toffee nut latte I had to get was so good, I got another iced latte (creamscicle) during my second visit.

I couldn't control my temptations & got a waffle each time. As other Yelpers recommended, I tried the Lumberjack (with bacon!) on my first visit. But I preferred the Slowberry waffle I got on my second visit. I liked the overall flavor better & I think the waffle was fresher on a Sunday morning.

Having been in the shop now, I can see why they only offer waffles. It's a small space. They don't have room for much else. However, I do wish there were some other food options available. For good coffee from a local place & an occasional calorie splurge on a waffle, I'm happy to have Cast Iron Waffles in Southpark."}
{"text":"Holy Moly ravioli, ok this place doesn't actually sell raviolis but I am sold on the concept. After sampling some AH-MAZING Authentic Belgian waffle at the yelper's rock party at the fillmore tonight, I am completely convinced on the idea of some Cast Iron Waffles. I am telling myself nothing sounds better than a warm cup of creamy espresso with foam and some more of the delicately sweetened waffles.

They make their waffles out of dough, what a great idea. Tastes very fluffy, soft and buttery. The top of the waffles are naturally sweetened with a glaze, paired with their home made maple syrup. Even their maple syrup is very honey tasting with a woody maple flavor, ahhh. 
Does this place have patio seating because if they do, I will be here every weekend for brunch. Bravo!

P.S. I actually looked really hard to find the name of the restaurant, this is how good their waffles tasted. Not to mention the long line waiting to sample their food."}
{"text":"Your \"ma and pop\" kinda shop- homey warm vibes.. Great service.. Scrumptious treats.. Hidden gem! Parking is small, and seating is limited, but makes it all worth ur while when u take a bite of a Belgium waffle! I like to go easy with the naked waffle, but don't be scared of the Nutella, bacon, or fruitier options. Toffee nut ice coffee is my go to- they also have large tea options and sell their homemade waffle syrup.. Make sure to get some waffles to go- or call em in for pick up :)"}
{"text":"Free wi-fi (waffle100) so that's a plus!  The coffee is good & they have several selections/concoctions including Italian Coffee.

The waffles are soooo good!  There are lots of options for creating just the taste you want, but by itself, it's fantastic.

A nice space in Piedmont Row with plenty of tables & plugs! Good connection speed, but if you have any troubles, let them know as they are still trying to figure out their bandwidth needs."}
{"text":"The food was awesome but the service was horrible. The person behind the counter never smile and appeared irritated by my family of four appearance at the restaurant. She never made a recommendation or engaged on anything regarding us trying to make a choice from the very extensive menu. The person who brought our food to us was a bit better as she smiled and asked if there was anything else she could do. At the end there wasn't even a goodbye or a thanks for stopping by---nothing. The waffles were great but I doubt I will be using the coupon I got emailed to me after my purchase. Atmosphere, environment and engagement do matter."}
{"text":"Stopped by today and tried the authentic Belgian Liege Waffles along with a excellent latte. The owner was there and she took the time to tell us about the differences in American waffles and the Belgian Liege waffle. I thought I knew about waffles but I learned a few things today. They were delicious and different from your regular Waffle House style of waffles. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Charlotte's a strange location for some of these things.

It's pretty easy to get to, although some construction around the buildings made parking a little bit of a challenge.  GPS also doesn't really know where this place is, so you'll have to kind of walk to find it.

Really tasty waffles made belgian style, so you won't find heaps of maple syrup, but plenty of other toppings like fruit and nutella to suit your appetite.  Definitely a great place, and I would love to return some day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little places ever! The waffles are so freaking amazing and the coffee is so great. Love the atmosphere of the place! Also I love the waffle Wednesday's with $2 naked waffles & $3 medium lattes."}
{"text":"Went by here today and they are now closed.  The phone number is disconnected.  Too bad.  They are supposed to be opening a new store at Carolina Place mall in June, but this unfortunately does no good for Piedmont Row."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. This place is super unique. The waffles are out of this world and one of a kind for me. They have so many choices and toppings for the waffles. I get the lumberjack which I recommend if you like bacon. It had a coffee house feel and isn't huge which I like. If you are in the area come take a swing by here."}
{"text":"Let me say that I like waffles.  Until somewhat recently - namely when I have to make them for the kids - I really prefer them over pancakes by a wide margin.  While you can pull waffles out of the freezer, it is just so much easier (and tastier) to make pancakes from scratch.  Sure, you can make waffles at home, but they are so messy.  And who has time to go to Waffle House every day?  But I digress.

The waffles at Cast Iron are different from just about any other waffle.  However, to have them, you have to find them, and that is a bit of a challenge.  The address does not help much.  It gets you in the area.  Their directions tell you they are \"across from the bank\", but in reality, they are in little shop in the base of a townhome (or that is what it looks like) - while all the other businesses are at the other end of the center.  So you are nowhere near where you would think they should be.  Keep that in mind.

Should you actually find the place, you may find yourself disappointed if you go at the wrong time.  While they sell their waffles to go (so you can enjoy them at home later), apparently if you go outside of busy hours, they actually make waffles during this time even for serving at non-busy hours.  So if you are are there at, say, dinner time - a nice, non-busy time where you might want a waffle for a treat - then you are likely to get a previously made, perhaps refrigerated or frozen waffle rather than a freshly prepared one.  Still tasty, but not great.

And there is not a ton of selection - not that that is a bad thing.  Waffles and some toppings (which you can customize).  Everything else is drinks.  Just so long as you are not expecting a version of the Belgium House of Waffles or the Waffle House of Belgium, you should be fine.  This is more the Belgium Kiosk of Waffles.  With beverages."}
{"text":"Wow!! Had an amazing breakfast.  If you like peanut butter cups, you should try the peanut butter cup waffle.   I also tried the lumberjack and it was equally delicious.  It was a little sweet for breakfast but a little desert for breakfast never hurt anyone.  I did have to take it down a couple stars because they did not have free refills on coffee and they ask for gratuity at the register."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast! Really cozy place, everything is super sweet so proceed with caution. Solid four stars. Loved my berries and cream waffle. It was yeasty, chewy, crispy, and sweet. I also got a caramel macchiato that I should've skipped, just added to the sugar stickiness. Boyfriend got the Nutella strawberry and we traded half way thru. Also really good. :)"}
{"text":"I was the only one there on a sleepy Thursday afternoon. I had a banana/strawberry/nutella and whipped cream waffle. It was very sweet and filling. I also had a latte which was super hot but good once it cooled down. $8-ish for both; not bad for an afternoon treat. At first, I thought they were located in Birkdale but they are actually across the street next to a Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Highly recommend cast iron waffles if you've never been. These dense sugary waffles are so sweet and delicious. Not a whole lot of seating so we get ours frozen to go in bulk. Can't tell the difference. The butter syrup combo on the sweet is terrific and you don't need much."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Won't accept their own company's coupons. We had a coupon for buy one get one free waffle, and they refused to accept it and threatened to call the police."}
{"text":"Good little place when you dont want a huge breakfast at terrace cafe. Staff was very personable and polite. Had the berry waffle and caramel latte."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place late last year and, can I just say, what a scrumptious find! 

The owner was super friendly and offered me a taste of their fair-trade coffees. Note the coffee sacks hanging up as decor - this place ONLY serves fair trade and direct trade coffee, and for this I applaud them. They also provide eco-friendly compostable coffee cups to-go.

Those liege waffles brought back fond memories of Belgium and yes, they are rich, and they not so cheap, but just sit back and enjoy it slowly, sip on your coffee to balance out the sweetness, enjoy the chill coffeehouse music playing, take in the unique and cozy atmosphere and revel in the non-chainy, non-impersonal style that is Cast Iron Waffles. 

The place is pricey but this is justified by its fair-trade coffee, quality waffles, independent flair and friendly service. The place is small, so plan ahead, get there early, or just take it to go. 

Bottom line, enjoy it for what it is and go support your local coffee shop! 

May more like-minded shops open up all over Charlotte and give those boring, large, average coffee chains a little competitive kick in the rear. Dare to demand something different :)"}
{"text":"Cast Iron Waffles are greater than life. They are slightly crispy and chewy with crunchy little pieces of sugar embedded inside. Of course you could enjoy eating them plain but if you have the option of adding nutella, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, and powdered sugar on top then obviously you kinda have to. (Just get the Deluxe waffle.) Plus strawberries and bananas are fruit which helps you justify eating 100000 calories in sugar.
Small, but def super filling. The coffee is eh but this is a waffle place after all."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time, was highly disappointed. The employee and owner (I think) were very rude and not willing to answer any questions that we had about the menu. It's unfortunate for them because the waffles were delicious but because of the attitude we received I hate to say I won't be giving them any more business!"}
{"text":"The waffles are like crack! I'm a Nutella and banana  fanatic, and they combined my 2 favorites on one of their to die for waffles. Even their plain waffles come with the butter syrup which is sinful. 

The downside: my last 3 visits their coffee was pretty terrible. Expensive and very watered down. I can't always indulge in waffles, my waistline doesn't approve... So I wish they had better coffee or maybe breakfast sandwiches or something."}
{"text":"Good place for a cup of coffee and waffle. Had the plain waffle with extra maple butter. Excellent!  They use fresh whipped cream. I will definitely be back. Relaxing and good. Many varieties of toppings"}
{"text":"Cool place, small yet nice. If you go at the right time you can have a pleasant experience. Staff was nice. Unto the waffles. They are SWEET you almost need nothing other than maybe fresh fruit. I'm sure kids love it but almost too sweet for me to eat if you get the Deluxe Waffle..."}
{"text":"Amazing Waffles, I had 1 specialty Pecan waffle. Then had to have a second plain one. It was great by itself. Then I purchase 3 more to take home."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast sugar-shock on Saturday morning. The atmosphere is mellow and hip, the food and coffee were delish', and the folks behind the counter were SUPER nice.  We'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Best waffle I have ever had in my life. Try the deluxe waffle with Nutella, whipped cream, strawberries and banana. Will come back here every time I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Walk in it a chain with counter service.  Staff was a cute little girl very sweet.  Menu overhead was waffles and coffee, tea drinks.  You can't get eggs or other things here so if your thinking one can get waffles and other get eggs think again.  It really is waffles and you know waffles.
  Waffles had so much sugar that my husband couldn't finish it.  I should say he's eaten a pound of Godiva  at a time.  They are more like a dessert. Don't do breakfast here unless your fasting Blood sugar is like tanking out and your about to call 911 for a coma. 
   The tea was decent but you have to pay for refills on coffee and tea.(not cool). It wasn't like they were making Chemex coffee for you, just came out a large carafe my husband said it was ok coffee.  Cleanliness was awesome."}
{"text":"Place is pretty legit. Just wish every waffle was made fresh on the spot. They just take some pre-made waffles and warm them up. I got one with Nutella, strawberries and whipped cream. Mocha Latte was good too. Just need to make them fresh and you'd be a 5 star shop!

Menu is pretty limited but the place is small too. So it's not like they can start making a bunch of extra stuff. If you are into crepes, this is a nice, smaller alternative. 

I shall return."}
{"text":"More positives than negatives:

Negative: 

Quite dark inside for mid day, they only have natural light coming from one side. 

No side items to speak of.  Would have rounded out the brunch with some fruit.

Positive:

Dem are good waffles. I tried the peanut butter cup. It wasn't overly topped where you couldn't taste the sweet waffles. Since these are made from dough and not batter, they are sweet and taste great as dessert. My wife enjoyed the Lumberjack, it was a great balance of salty and sweet.... bacon! 

The setup is nice. Hard to balance the decor for a waffle place and an espresso shop. It definitely leans toward waffle place."}
{"text":"I'm not huge on sweets but these waffles were great! For 8 dollars, I got 2 waffles. The lumberjack has maple buttercream and bacon (how could you go wrong with that) and the deluxe has fruit, whipped cream and Nutella. I substituted Nutella with maple butter. Apparently you can substitute ingredients on all the waffles! 

The waffle was so good and not mushy at all! Yelp allows you to take off a dollar on a waffle after checking in so be sure to do that. I will definitely be coming back. :) 

P. S. Their coffee is a little on the expensive side but their service is great!"}
{"text":"Nice little place specializing in waffles.  They are very good, but sweet in general and with added toppings, sugar rush!  Would still go back when in the mood for waffles and something sweet."}
{"text":"Authentic Belgium Waffles!  Not really a breakfast spot, more like a dessert spot.  They offer a full coffee bar, but the best is the medium roast coffee. If you get the fruit on the waffle then it balances out the sweetness. The Nutella on it is awesome too!  Small place, not good for big crowds."}
{"text":"I visited this location during the afternoon for a quick snack. Ordered the plain waffle which turned out to be very dry. Nothing Belgian about it. My guess is that the waffle was made in the morning and then sat under a lamp or in a display all day prior to being reheated to serve to suckers who decide on a waffle for an afternoon snack. I have tried the same waffle in the morning at the Blakeney location and trust me it was divine. Suggestion to owner: do not serve pre-made waffles in the afternoon. Just make them fresh. I can wait. Seriously."}
{"text":"Its just WAFFLES, no eggs. I missed the eggs. I ordered the bacon waffle with what I'm assuming was some kind of maple frosting. The waffle was fluffy and had specks of caramelization thoughout, but a little dry. I asked for extra frosting when I placed my order and she seemed a little confused at the request. I guess I baffled her. Anyway, coffee was not bad, considering the shit I've been drinking. Its gotta be the water. Overall, a kitschy little place with four tables. You place your order, get ur own coffee and they bring you the waffle. End of story. I still want those eggs."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The size of the waffle was like a thick bread slice. Nothing special. They gave you paper plates and plastic utensils. We had coffee, a latte and a waffle each, for $20. We probably won't go back. My husband said, he'd rather go to IHOP."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best breakfast ever. Everything is so good. I am a sucker for sweets. I could eat here every morning. I am so glad they finally opened a location closer to me. Love Love LOVE!"}
{"text":"Great waffles, great coffee! The waffles are thick and hearty and delicious!

Served on plastic, which is a little interesting considering how eco friendly they appear to be.

Try the cinnamon roll waffle! Sweet, but not too sweet!"}
{"text":"The staff was very personable and knowledgeable about the products that they carry and the sticky bun waffle was awesome it was so Savory  with pecans and caramel sauce and a topping that cinnamon and sugar"}
{"text":"Simple, cozy and delicious. This place is small but the waffles are great and the price cannot be beat.  Loved it here and will be back!"}
{"text":"As a culinarian i try to go into food establishments with an open mind. I complain very little since I have understanding of what it takes to create great dishes. I can't say that this place has that at all....

When I think of a cast iron I think of something very hot which should allow whatever it is I'm making to be crispy. A soft delectable doughy waffle with a crisp crust, sounds amazing right!? 

My waffle with bacon and an imitation Cinnabon icing was far from that, in fact it had a stale texture.

The biggest and most dissapointing was after my nine month pregnant ordered a Naked (basic waffle with powdered sugar) we were informed syrup is an additional charge.....wait, What?!

So if you had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich stand, would you charge additional for bread? Owners you need to work on your concept a little better."}
{"text":"So if you like waffles, you'd better get all up in this place... Seriously.  It's absolutely delicious... 

I went with a couple friends to celebrate one of them finishing a triathelon and we had a great time... I ordered the one with maple buttercream and bacon on top... I think it's called the Lumberjack... It was out of this world, but let me tell you something... There is a reason they do not provide extra syrup or butter in this place... You'd probably end up in some sugar induced coma if you added anything to this... I am obsessed with sweets and even I couldn't finish it all in one sitting... 

The set up of the shop is a little Starbucks-ish, but different... We didn't know what to do since we hadn't been there before but we felt our way around... We weren't sure if we were supposed to clear our table since they delivered the food to us, so we went ahead and did that ourselves... No big... The staff were hilarious and I enjoyed interacting with them...  That waffle was a straight up fluffy taste explosion and I loved every minute of it... I guess I'll have to work up my sugar tolerance because I refuse to leave another one unfinished... Maybe I'll just go classic next time... 

OH!  Keep in mind, all they do is waffles... If you want bacon strips, eggs, grits or any other waffle accompaniments, there is none of that here... It's just waffles... Good thing they're frickin fabulous!"}
{"text":"The waffles and coffee are so delicious. Wide variety of different ways to get a waffle and even though the size is deceiving they are very filling. Love the ambiance and I am never let down. I will continue to bring people here."}
{"text":"Great real Belgian style waffles. They're so much heartier than usual waffles. I ordered the deluxe with Nutella, strawberries, raspberries, and whipped cream. At first I thought this is way too small but it filled me up. I also has a toasted marshmallow latte which wasn't a marshmallow flavored as I wanted but still good. Great service!"}
{"text":"After hearing about amazing coffee I had to try.  Waffles are good, my son had a S'mores one he loved and I had a cinnamon roll one.  I wouldn't say they are amazing, but they are good.  Ordered an iced mocha latte.  I'll admit...I am super super high maintenance about my coffee and I pretty much expect perfection.  The iced mocha fell way short.  It tasted like an iced latte with hardly any ice.  Iced mochas are the perfect balance of espresso, chocolate, milk and ice.  This had very little ice (like 5-6 cubes) and the chocolate was barely noticeable.  As far as an iced latte goes, it was decent, but it was not a good iced mocha. Since the focus of this place is waffles and not coffee though I still gave three stars for the tasty waffles. Probably won't  be back because we don't live very close, but I'm glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now for breakfast on the weekends, the last visit being yesterday with my sister and her two lil kids.  Both times I have had the same thing:  waffle with strawberries and whipped cream.  Surprisingly, the waffle dough they use is very tasty, and one waffle is pretty filling.  It is already sweetened, so as I had mine, i think it's perfect just the way it is.

The only complaints I have are:

- The plates and silverware (plastic-ware).  I totally understand it's a small location, but it is VERY hard to cut the waffles on a glossy plastic plate with a flexible plastic knife.  Feel free to stay with the plastic ware, but just upgrade to a better quality to make it easier to eat on.    For this reason, and not the fault of the food, hot chocolate, or service, i have to give it less than 5 stars.

The staff is very friendly (some cute girls too!) , the restaurant definitely feels more like a coffee house, but luckily this one serves pretty delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge waffle person, but this place is great! I've even purchased some frozen to bring to family in savannah.  They loved them also.  My daughter and I always get the deluxe with strawberries and bananas and mocha lattes. Fabulous! The only flaw is when the place is too crowded to get a parking spot or table. I think perhaps some people don't realize you order first and then grab a table.  If you're in the mood to indulge at breakfast, come here.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"For the best belgian waffle this place is a must try on your bookmark on yelp!  Belgian waffle is like eating dessert for breakfast so so so good. The dough is made the original way free wifi good good good coffee. If you like this place sign up on there website to receive text messages for good promotion."}
{"text":"They've got delicious waffles here, but the coffee is terrible. Our favorite waffles are the naked without the powdered sugar (already has sugar nuggets within the dough) and the deluxe (Nutella, strawberries, bananas and whip cream). Our kids love their waffles and we sometimes taken frozen ones to go. The bacon waffle is good too if you like the savory and sweet combo.

We've had coffee at both locations (Ballantyne and southpark) and it's TERRIBLE. We've had Americanos, lattes and chai teas...all tasted watered down. They need to invest in some good baristas and better beans. Come for the waffles, but get your coffee from Rush, Not just coffee or even Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping I would like this place but to be fair I only had  the coffee...... I asked for the coffee extra hot I even gave her the temperature of where I wanted it.  I told her I don't like warm coffee I like very hot coffee...... She said she would make it hot..... when she gave it to me it felt somewhat hot but when I took my first sip I could see that it was not hot at all....it  was not to my liking...... I asked her if there was any way I could make this hotter and she said no not now it's already made!   She did not offer to make me another one at a much hotter temperature as I had requested when I put my order in...... That is very disappointing since I spent $4.40 on coffee that was lukewarm....and I didn't finish it..... I probably will never go back there.....what happened to making the customer happy????.???  Guess not"}
{"text":"Following the recent Yelp shindig where Cast Iron gave away samples of their waffles, I came here. The next day. And I brought Mrs. K and K Junior, because there's not much that we love more than wonderful waffles. And wonderful waffles is what we had. I went with mine plain, but the others were ordered with nutella and whipped cream. And let me tell you, these things are plenty sweet all on their own. You really don't have to add anything.

An hour later, the sugar crash hit us all pretty hard. Nap time. But it was SO worth it."}
{"text":"I happened in on the second day of their soft open, so they were still training their cashier and barista which, understandably, slowed things down a bit. With that said this is still a great place to grab coffee on this side of town. I did try their waffles and they are delicious. They were so good you could actually eat one for dessert. 

The owners were actively involved and very friendly, once everyone is trained this place will be a success."}
{"text":"For a Saturday morning breakfast, I can't think of anything better. Soon after this little joint opened, a friend said to me, \"You HAVE to try this new waffle place!\" But I was on my way just as soon as I heard the word \"waffle.\"

These are not, I repeat, NOT like Waffle House. They're Belgian Liege waffles. super dense, chewy -- they're made with dough instead of batter, and imbedded in the final product are crystallized sugar pearls. 

Your best bet for a top-notch waffle is going at a busy time...you'll have a bit of a wait, but tasting a freshly ironed(?) waffle is worth it. At non-peak hours, expect that you'll be served a waffle that was made a few minutes ago.

They have an old-school coke machine that you put quarters in. It's a bit tricky, so take the advice of the staff and pull it out quick!! ;)

Great spot for breakfast meetings, and they offer free wi-fi. Apparently their coffee is highly regarded by the readers of Creative Loafing. It's not my favorite, but when you need something warm and delicious to wash down your waffle, it's never a bad choice. 

There's a TV at the bar, so you can watch something if you're not keen on conversation. Outdoor seating is a plus, when the weather's nice. I always park in the bank parking lot and walk over. It's easier than parallel parking next to the shop.

Definitely go for the \"Extra Sweet\" variety with maple butter, sans the powdered sugar. Nothing gets me out of bed on a Saturday morning like the thought of that waffle."}
{"text":"I can't help it. I love Cast Iron Waffles.

Ever since the first moment I walked into the Ballantyne location, my heart has belonged to the perfectly chewy and sweet waffles served here. Very little makes me happier than a simple, naked waffle from CIW.

However, to be fair, they have lots of other delicious toppings and waffle-esque pairings, like a fancy cappuccino or freshly brewed cup of Joe.

This location is nestled in Piedmont Row, a perfect locale for those who spend time in the South Park area, or are wandering by during a day of shopping at the mall. Parking is plentiful, either close by (parallel) or in the deck.

Thankful for this new addition to the burgeoning food scene in SP and hope this store is as successful as the original one. The recipe has, thankfully, stayed the same."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Love the waffles (extra sweet with maple butter). Love the simplicity. 

Don't know how you could come in here and be disappointed in the least. It's a fabulous concept and I am glad this location is open. 

Parking is a breeze in the garage just next door. 

Customer service has always been splendid for us. Could have something to do with the adorable baby we have started taking with us."}
{"text":"I stop in frequently because I work nearby. Their coffee is great and the waffles are also delicious. The place is somewhat small and has a coffeehouse feel. This is my go to spot for coffee when I'm in the area working. Please keep in mind, that these are not the same style of waffle that most people would identify with. They contain Belgian pearl sugar, are very sweet, and of a different consistency than most waffles. I prefer to eat them with nothing on top of them, but I have had peanut butter and sloeberry jam on them. If you go in thinking you're getting a Belgian waffle that you would order from most restaurants, you will probably be disappointed. I have recommended this place to several coworkers that visit from out of town, and they were extremely happy with the service and product.

The staff is always friendly and talkative, and I've never had an experience that I wasn't happy with! Please stop in and check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place in a whim with a friend. It was a cute little place and the staff was super friendly. We both tried the berry waffles and absolutely loved them!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Wonderful little hidden cafe.   Coffee selections are great and so are waffles.  Portions are on small side. My husband and I could've had 2 orders each and boys usually split but ate a whole. Very good!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my daughter. The service was great!  Had a brief conversation with the owner - very nice person. As for the waffles I had the Lumberjack and my daughter had the cinnamon roll. My daughter loved hers and mine was pretty good too. I would have preferred it to be a little warmer and softer though. I agree the time it took to prepare was a little long, but I know that is all part of being new and I'm optimistic for them getting better (thus the 4 star rating - giving them room to improve). We will be back soon and knowing my daughter, often too."}
{"text":"I am glad to see them open!! The waffles are awesome the coffee is amazing and the workers are so polite! If you haven't tried the waffles run don't walk now! You won't be disappointed! YUM"}
{"text":"The Lumberjack waffle is my fave! Maple buttercream and BACON! Seating is limited, that's the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"These waffles are just delicious. Not too sweet and just crunchy enough. The blended coffee is amazing. If you are a coffee lover, definitely give it a try! Super nice and chill atmosphere. Great for catching up and enjoying your brunch"}
{"text":"We love waffles, so heading to this place seemed like a home run....and it definitely was.  The staff was great and the prices are very reasonable. (less than $5 per waffle)  They offer coffee house type drinks and a variety of waffle creations.

We got the Maple and Bacon Waffle, which was phenomenal.  Luckily the portion size is not too large, because we would have eaten it until we had gotten sick. lol.  The waffle was not dry and the maple icing was great.  There was bacon packed into every single groove of the waffle as well.

We will definitely come back here to try more of their delicious waffles, like the chocolate peanut butter one."}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a restaurant and been turned off by everything before even trying the food? That is exactly the vibe of Cast Iron Waffles. When you walk into the restaurant the two girls behind the counter were extremely annoyed and you can tell by their expression. Then they don't want to answer questions about the menu, then they get annoyed when you asked them for more time to look at the menu, we didn't have a big party only two people. On top of that the girl who was putting the waffles into the oven to re-heat the waffle would be touching and texting on her phone then she goes and touches the waffle without any gloves or tongs and puts the waffle in the over. 
After more careful observation they touch everything with their hands and the entire time we were observing them they never washed their hands ONCE. All three people behind the counter prepared everything with their bare hands, then never used utensils or gloves. 
The food was only decent and it came out cold....even though we saw them heating up the waffles. We also saw them cutting the banana with their hands, then they would touch their hair and touch the food, we were so appalled at how unsanitary this place is. 
On the deluxe waffle they only had banana and strawberries as an option for fruit toppings and we got both banana and strawberries and when the waffle came out it literally has 3 slices of banana on it and 3 THINLY sliced strawberries. 
I honestly don't understand how this place even passed a health grade test. The workers here need a total attitude change, or just a change in jobs because they must hate their lives here."}
{"text":"Man nothing is more delicious than the Belgium waffles and coffee after a night of fun with friends! So I wanted to try these folks. 

I wish I could have this every day but I don't to end of on that Biggest Loser Show!

The only reason for giving them 5 stars was the taste. The food was good and I have to say they are doing their best. They were quite busy so it shows a lot of people agree with me!"}
{"text":"Excellent waffles   Small quiet place. Great service. Perfect escape from the fast food breakfast world."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp of how good this place was I felt like I could not leave Charlotte without giving these waffles a try.  They were good, but not the best waffle ever!    

I had a deluxe waffle with my son, by daughter had one with just nutella on it and my husband had a special called the lumberjack which had bacon on it. 


First they need to update their online menu.  It says they have waffle Sundaes and the girl working there said they got rid of that shortly after opening because the company they got their ice cream from lost all their ice cream when their freezers broke."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing.  I went the week that it opened, so service was rather slow.  Im sure they will work the kinks out.  The customer service and food was outstanding.  Ive never been to a Cast Iron Waffles before and I can see why they all get great reviews.  I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"A little hard to find, but the payoff is WORTH IT.  I found myself trying to kill time in the SouthPark area and wanted breakfast so after some yelp searches, decided to seek this place out.  It's located in Piedmont Row, really tucked in to the left of the round-about (if you are coming in from Fairview).

Once I parked in the parking deck, I made my way around to the front, opened the door and was assaulted (in a good way) by the smell of fresh waffles being made.  There was only one other person in the shop, sipping coffee and working at a table.  I was greeted right away and I asked a lot of questions regarding their most popular waffles.  The staffer was more than happy to explain that the waffle base is all the same, it's just the toppings that differ.  Lucky for me, she had just finished making some fresh waffles to I tried the cinnamon roll.  Unfortunately they were out of bacon so my first choice of the \"lumberjack\" was denied, but I was just as happy when the cinnamon roll and a mocha latte (I worked out that morning so I felt okay about it).

Over all, the shop itself is pretty cozy.  I'd say maybe a handful of tables, I witnessed a lot of people just jumping in to grab coffee before their day started.  I didn't stick around long enough to see if they had wifi, but it's probably safe to assume since someone was sitting there on their work laptop when I came in.

Looks like you can also buy a batch of frozen waffles here (dangerous), but I can totally see that as an option if you A) don't live near south park or B) want a little variety instead of the usual eggos :)."}
{"text":"Liege waffles. I'm doing my best to burn that into my mind so I don't forget the name of one of my favorite breakfast finds in a long while. I had them first at Cast Iron Waffles. And boy, what a treat.

Let's talk about this type of waffle. This isn't your standard puffy Belgian that starts crisp but swiftly turns to mush under the weight of maple syrup. These pucks of love are about half the size and two times the weight, sweeter than standard Belgians and dense to bite, made with pearl sugar which caramelizes as the waffle cooks. They're also incredibly tasty.

On Cast Iron itself -- no, you won't find much seating, and my group was lucky to get the last table available for our group of five. It happens, and is a testament to the shop's quality. Can't eat in? Get something to go. Buy a couple frozen and make them yourself. You'll live to see another day if you don't get a seat, though your waffle surely won't.

Our local friend who recommended the place noted he foolhardily ordered two waffles on his first trip to the establishment. While he ate both, he couldn't manage another bite of food the entire day. One is all you need, he said. And repeated himself. To look on these initially, you wouldn't expect his words to ring true. You're not going to find any of the usual breakfast sides on offer at Cast Iron, but frankly, you won't need them.

My berry waffle arrived at the table painfully last of all, as I sat in want watching my friends savor their lovely creations. The fruity concoction atop my liege waffle wasn't your average squeezed-from-a-bottle affair, featuring a mix of multiple berries that gave a sweet and sour twist to every flavor-rich, delicious bite. My friend's banana, strawberry and chocolate combo was the best at the table, but mine was still comparably amazing. The coffees, hot and cold, were also universally praised.

This waffle will make you very full. It will likely shorten your lifespan. It will make you wonder whether Cast Iron offers to wheel you back to your car for a couple bucks extra tip. But it's oh so worth it."}
{"text":"In a town where bottomless mimosas and hour long wait lists reign supreme, this hidden gem was a joy to stumble upon. 

We were up early looking to grab a bite before a panthers game. Our hopes of beating the Sunday morning church crowd to our standby breakfast place were completely destroyed when we found a line out the door and a wait list an hour long. 

We had heard of Cast Iron Waffles, but have never been. Upon walking we found a quiet shop with a cool vibe. If you're looking for a full English breakfast, this place isn't it. But we were able to order immediately, the coffee was about the same as Starbucks from a price standpoint, but roughly 1000 times better. My girl ordered a pumpkin waffle and a chai latte. Picture of the waffle attached. I had every intention of ordering a cinnamon roll waffle and a latte. What came out of my mouth was a cinnamon roll latte. The barista willingly accepted my off the menu challenge. I also scarfed down a cinnamon roll waffle. So much so I forgot to take a photo for you fine folks. 

Long story short if you're looking white table cloths and crab legs: keep looking. If you're looking for a great cup of coffee, a low key atmosphere and an amazing waffle."}
{"text":"Tried it, price is way too high for what you get...a waffle out of a warmer with minimal toppings, paper plates and plastic utensils. Just tasted like an average waffle. could have eaten two or three. Not worth the price at all.  We ended up going to Dunkin Donuts for some more food after eating here."}
{"text":"Cute place to go enjoy some waffles and coffee. They do have acai bowls! Will have to go back for that."}
{"text":"After a few confused turns while walking, I humbled myself to use the directory on Piedmont Row to find this place. It happened to be on the one street I didn't drive down while looking for parking. Go figure. I took my daughter here for her birthday breakfast. She loves waffles, and was very excited looking over the menu. She choose the chocolate chip waffle, I went with the cinnamon sugar and frosted waffle.

As a true waffle novice, I looked around for some syrup to put on the waffle, as I had done all my life with the plain ones I ate at home or at Waffle House. My daughter reminded me that what I was eating was sweet enough, and syrup would be overkill. She was correct. One bite told me that the cinnamon and frosting was all the sweetness I needed. These waffles are very sweet, like Nestle Crunch and a Slurpee for breakfast sweet.

We both are 95% of our waffles, but had to throw in the towel. They were firm around the edge, yet softer in the middle. Much thicker than what you would get at the Waffle House. The shop is cozy, and the server was friendly and warm."}
