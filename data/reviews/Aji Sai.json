{"text":"I've been here a few times the food is fantastic the place is clean and you can't go wrong with $13.99 all you can eat lunch and even dinner is only $19.99 The food is absolutely delicious but the service is shit, that's why there's one star off and also because we went this Monday at 11:30am but they opened the doors at noon we thought we were mistaken but even the sign on their door said 11:30am. It's a nice location and it's so worth it. 

Note: take it easy on the tempura stuff the portions are crazy huge."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times this year and it's OK.  Nothing spectacular about the decor or the menu but it is priced on the lower end of the AYCE Japanese restaurants in the city.  It's not very big and twice we came with a group of 10 so we sat in the far back up the stairs.  It is one of the better AYCE places in the Yonge-Bloor area.  It appears to be a chain of Aji Sai in the city and I haven't been to the others before.

Chinese operation here (like most of the Japanese restaurants in the city).  The quality of food was average compared to others I've reviewed on Yelp.  Sashimi is not as good as the other places.  The service was average and the server told us we could only order ice cream once (as much as we wanted) because too much scooping it was difficult on her arms.  One of the personal trainers in our group (yes, we're gym rats) offered her his services :P I've given this a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"This place is okay but their other location is better in food quality and service. I will be reviewing their buffet

The sushi buffet doesnt always have a sushi item you want and the fish itself isnt always fresh. They always seem to be out of salmon skin handrolls when I eat their buffet (and I have literally been to this place for their buffet more than 5 times). In addition, the sauce they use to spice up the handroll or sushi gets boring and stale after used in more than one sushi item (Spicy California roll, various handrolls, and sushi pizza). The non-sushi items in the buffet do not taste good: the sweet and sour chicken is drenched in sour sauce (the same sauce used to drench the spring rolls) and dumplings are bland. 

As for the service, the staff look miserable and unfriendly. The food doesnt necessarily come when you mark it down, or in a timely manner. We got explicitly scoffed at by the manager because we gave them a smaller tip as a result of the crappy service. If smaller tips are not indicative to staff of a needed change in customer service standards, then its no wonder the buffet has yet to improve over the months.

For such an expensive buffet, there are other sushi places to spend your money on (such as their other location). 

Only good point is the convenient location."}
{"text":"It may seem uncharitable to give one star but this is the worst place ever.  If I could give a zero I would. I've been there 4 times only because it was where I was invited each time, and after tonight you couldn't pay me to go back. 
Aside from the food being carelessly made and randomly served, the 4 staff members they had were ignorant at best. Words can't describe the lengthy list of neglectful, complacent and rude service we received.
What could have been a pleasant 1 hour meal was a 2 hour ordeal, they would bring stuff at random some things taking an hour or simply forgotten, there was one grimy i-pad for the whole table of 7 to pass around instead of menus.. very self serve, and the staff stood around texting or chatting with each other, and even out right ignored you when politely asked for anything. I found myself having to be outright bossy and rude in order for anything to happen eg. cup of tea, beverages, condiments. I have many server friends and am very conscious of how to courteously treat servers, but this was unbelievable. 
On top of the worst service I've had in my life, and I'm not exaggerating.. everyone had AYCE and felt bloated after.  
Two of use were was wise enough to order 2 dishes each a la carte, which the waiters resented us for because AYCE is easier and more profitable for them. 
Despite the small amount I ate, I felt indigestion, not only from the bland greasy food, but from worrying about how sanitary the preparation was. The bathroom was gross and if the servers were that careless, I'm terrified of what the kitchen was like.
If it wasn't a friend's birthday plan to eat there, I would have walked out at once or better yet, never set foot in there. 
It's my version of hell!"}
{"text":"It's definitely better than Kyoto AYCE :) and cheaper"}
{"text":"love the volcano roll and terriyaki salmon belly. of course all the sashimi and rolls are pretty good - and by good, i meant standard ayce sushi good. But still, things are quite fresh, rolls are nicely put together, adequate selection of appetizers. When it comes to sushi place downtown, this would be my place to go."}
{"text":"A once great AYCE sushi restaurant is now one of the worst for service and quality. They are under new management. I would give it a 0/5 if possible.

The servers are constantly confused, bring food to the wrong table repeatedly, and flat out ignore people. They used to have 2-3 sushi chefs working at a time, now they have 1. There appears to be a constant backlog of orders now that they do Foodora. This translates into a restaurant of people waiting up to an hour (yes, an hour) for an order of sushi while irate delivery guys hover at the counter. If you follow up, you get a confused look with a light \"oh sorry\" and nothing is done. Honestly a huge shame they can't figure their business out. We've been going for 6 years and have always recommended it, but will not go back. 

Particularly bad experience tonight:
-could only order sushi twice in 2 hours and 15 minutes because of how slow the service was and how backed up the chef was with take out orders, which he prioritized. 
-Avocado salad served with no avocado.
-Spicy salmon roll served with no spicy sauce. 
-Too much rice on the rolls as if they're trying to fill you up quicker.
-Rolls were wrong and when we gently corrected the waitress, she started pointing at a menu item in an effort to prove they were right, only to realize they weren't. I politely asked for the correct item (how crazy that I'd want what I ordered) and the chef gave us cut eye and took 20 minutes to fix it.  
-Eating dinner while listening to frustrated Foodora delivery guys the whole time.
-We asked for the bill, waited and then watched as our server left for the night. We had to ask another waitress twice for it.
-Confirmed they are under new management, who clearly have no clue how to run a restaurant.

I've never experienced something worse in a restaurant than the last two visits here. GO ELSEWHERE. There are better places!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends, and I would definitely say it's a better AYCE sushi restaurant. Some foods I really like from here: avocado salad, seaweed salad, vegetable and salmon soup, rock n' roll shrimp, grilled salmon, pretty much all the rolls, and some more that I can't remember. 

However, the only thing I dislike about this restaurant is their gratuity system. I absolutely hate it when restaurants impose a gratuity on you (especially for small parties of, say, three), because I find it tacky and rude. I can understand if they do this for large parties, but we were three people. I happily tip waitstaff 15-20%, depending on how ingratiating they are, so they're actually losing out by making me pay 13%. 

Secondly, when you pay with credit card or debit, the machine asks you if you want to add a tip, sort of encouraging you to tip twice if you don't read the bill carefully and realize that the tip is already included in the total price. My friend and I both made this mistake, because the waitress simply quoted a tip-inclusive price verbally as she brought our bills and punched in payment prices on her machine, so we had not even had a chance to look at the bill.  My friend thought the price we paid was mathematically too high for the dinner price, so we did decide to look over the bill. After we realized the double tip, the waiter adamantly **refused** to give us our extra money back. They said it would be too much work for them. Really? I've worked in restaurants before, and all they would have had to do was make a note when balancing the till, or inform management regarding the discrepancy. They had no reason at all to not refund us. After almost getting into an argument with them, they grudgingly gave us the money back and didn't seem happy at all! I still remember this experience... just because it stood out so much. So beware of double tips if you come here."}
{"text":"Not great quality of sushi. Tiny pieces of fish on top of the \"dragon rolls\" which had maybe one type of fish in them too....and that was it. A ton of rice instead of fish/ veggies in the sushi, the ratio was totally off. The tempura was decent, but again not worth it for Ayce dinner at basically $24 (tax included). Much better places around it. Service was quick, but awful attitude of the waitress which was unsurprising given the reviews. Never going back."}
{"text":"This became my absolute favorite sushi place when I moved in to Toronto in 2004. However, unfortunately, it became too popular for its own good. Longer line ups, grumpier waitresses and lesser fish quality.
Still a good spot for sushi cravings though, at a very decent price and a perfect location!"}
{"text":"It's ok if you want to stuff your face with a lot of rice.  We were there at 4 pm and missed the lunch price.   The all-you can eat dinner deal is over $20, and is not really that much of a deal.   Sushi pizza was deep fried and greasy.  You can get better sushi rolls at the foodcourt.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm an ex-Vancouverite so I'm a bit of a sushi snob. However, Aji Sai wasn't half bad! Came here for the $20 dinner AYCE on a Saturday. The restaurant wasn't packed so our food came out fast. 

Sashimi was fresh and the slices were adequately sized. Tempura was crispy and fluffy. The house rolls were great, especially the Volcano Roll and the Black Dragon -- very delicious! They also offer butterfish sashimi, which I've barely seen elsewhere. They have pretty good filling-to-rice ratio in their sushi so it wasn't just a chunk of rice like many other AYCE sushi places in Toronto. 

As extensive as the AYCE dinner menu was, there was no seafood motoyaki! Blasphemy! And no oysters either... =( 

However, this place would get four stars if it wasn't for the rude service stint at the end. We were about an hour and half into our dinner and was about to finish off with ice cream, a waitress told us that there was a group of six waiting at the door and they were running out of tables, at which time she handed us our bill. When we handed her our order form, she said that would be the last round (I've never seen limits to ordering rounds at AYCE places). We were almost done anyway, and we didn't want to keep the group of six waiting, so we finished our ice cream and left. As I was walking out the door, I saw another WHOLE EMPTY SECTION at the back of the restaurant behind the sushi bar that was elevated by maybe five steps of stairs. There was definitely more than enough space to sit a group of six, and she rushed us out for nothing. 

At least the food was solid."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! We just finished our meal. We went for the AYCE option. Everything we ordered was subpar. The salmon sashimi quality was quite low, the shrimp tempura was not freshly made, the 'steak' teriyaki was hard to stomach, the new bacon shrimp tempura was gross, you get the point it was terrible!!! We had eaten there just a few months ago and it was pretty good so we returned, but never again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. It's a relative decent AYCE place. I liked the sashimi. Salmon, saba and butterfish were all good and fresh. Sadly, they didn't have tuna on the menu. Seawood salad was awesome (Ordered twice). The sushi maki rolls are average. Th firehouse roll was prob the best one with fish flakes on top, but everything tastes the same (different variations of california rolls with minimum differences). Avoid anything that has tempura in it. Feels like the tempura wasn't particularly fresh and a bit soggy so the sushi roll that had tempura bits tasted below average. Their katsu was good , but other appetizer dish were rather lacking.

Tried their ice-cream desserts. Red bean and green tea were okay, but avoid the mango pudding at all cost. Even my boyfriend who is not hat picky about food couldn't finish the pudding. 

Great service overall. The order came really quickly. Granted, we were the one of the two tables that night. No problem with the bills and the server was attentive. 

Overall, good value for the food and downtown location if you go there hungry and order sashimi and a few special rolls. The ambiance is not great though, the place does feel a bit dreadful with its lighting."}
{"text":"I came here to eat on a Saturday night and ordered the AYCE. Ordered the spicy sushi roll and it did NOT look fresh. The rice broke apart and salmon was unappealing. Later ordered some dimsum. And it looked as if was microwaved. I decided to give them the 3 star for their attentive service and willingness to move to a warm table since their original spot by the door was freezing."}
{"text":"Good sushi, fast service! ... Not the best i tasted, but surely works if you crave for sushi, and thats the only place nearby, you can go to kill the Sushi craving."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch to try the all you can eat since my favourite place in the area recently closed.  It was unfortunately underwhelming.  I've had some amazing AYCE sushi and this did not stack up.  I got a green dragon roll and the avacado was hard to the point of crunch.  my handrolls were also not that great as im pretty sure the seaweed was stale.  I didn't end up getting the last 2 handrolls that I ordered but I didn't even mention it to them because quite frankly, I didn't want them after what I had already eaten.  I also ordered a miso soup and it was just not good.  Toronto has some of the best sushi that i've had so I was upset that this was the quality that it was.  The service was fast and they were nice enough, but not the best at customer service.  One server stood beside my table because I only had 2 rolls left and she wanted to take my plate away - so she waited and watched me eat.  

I won't go back again"}
{"text":"Monday afternoon, co workers and I amble to Sushi Inn http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-inn-toronto#hrid:q56OXpYiMNBnRBufpQMOtQ to get some lunch. It is full, and the downstairs is mysteriously closed. Not wanting to wait 30 min for a table, we head to Aji Sai. 

I don't love AYCE. Its usually gross. But I went for it and I was shocked. I have been to Aji Sai in Barrie and it was sub-par, so I never returned. This location was actually good. The fish was of good quality, the menu was extensive including udon soups, teppanyaki, sushi and maki. No sashimi however they did have butterfish sushi which was fantastic. The rice to fish ratio was well balanced overall. 

Some of the best sushi I have had in Toronto lately, surprisingly. (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-marche-toronto#hrid:nLERMU8gcxKpquphj8eJpQ) And lunch price was $12.99, which was tremendous value, especially considering what you get at Asahi http://www.yelp.ca/biz/asahi-sushi-toronto#hrid:CzczcqhOxWkVlFQ2h2fAIw for the same price in the same neighbourhood. (18 pieces of cucumber and avocado roll for example)

Solid choice. Service was ok but not great. I will return however, and soon."}
{"text":"Gross probably about one of the worst AYCE sushi places I've tried in the city. 

Nothing fresh, nothing made right, portions are so large, it's unreal. I had a single order of chicken terriyaki and I get a bowl of oversauced gummy chicken the size of Texas?

The restaurant's mission is clear.. to stuff you with rice or whatever you order til you're sick of it. 

Price for dinner wasn't cheap either and service was cold as a cucumber. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of my UofT friends for some Reading week stomach stuffing... mission complete! 

Everyone left with pants feeling tighter and wallets feeling lighter. $26.50 Weekend dinner AYCE. not the most expensive I've had, but still a large amount so best kept to a \"once in a while\" outing.

The Goods!
Sashimi - White Tuna, Salmon, Surf Clam
Maki - Boston, Mango/avocado, Smoked Salmon, Spider, tons more ITIS set in so memory got a bit fuzzy =P.
Tempura - Yam, Shrimp
Grill - General Tao, Sweet and Sour Chicken.
Sides - Seaweed salad, Edamame, Agedashi Tofu
Dessert - Fried Banana w/ drizzled chocolate, Ice Cream (Green tea, Red bean, mango)
Really wished I had noticed the Boston Roll earlier and definitely regret not getting more sashimi!!
Avoid the Grill options that we got, we had some people who didn't like raw fish (sad times). 

Service was very good for an AYCE joint, perhaps because of the dinner hour (Price) they are on their best behaviour? 

Definitely planning on going again for lunch this time!"}
{"text":"Not a best place to have  jap  food. The teriyaki chicken was rubbery, veggie / tofu tempura were oily. It was not even close to good."}
{"text":"They charge 15% gratuity. That is very annoying and unfair. 

It makes it difficult to be cheap."}
{"text":"Good fast service, pretty broad menu, I got my fill.

They had sashimi when I went. 

I only had a few annoyances like lack of tea and unpredictable portion sizes.."}
{"text":"First review.

Terrible service. We asked for wasabi like 5 times without an answer. Food is also leaves a lot to be desired"}
{"text":"Dinner visit. Seated quickly. Opted for a la carte menu. $1 oysters when you purchase an alcoholic beverage or opt for their all you can. These were really good! Got the tatoki sushi roll and that was mediocre (not a big fan of cream cheese in my rolls) majority of the choices incl. cheese so it's difficult to shy away from it and not to mention the offering list is short. Beef kimchi fried were mediocre. Sushi combo was ok. Service was fast and good. Prices reasonable. Overall, experience is positive and would visit again primarily for the oysters. (Mon-Weds special)"}
{"text":"Decent food for the price, but don't expect high quality ingredients.
The major issue though is they automatically added a 15% gratuity to the bill for a party of 2. Their credit card machine will also ask if you want to tip on top of the already added tip. That is just dishonest. Beware not to tip twice."}
{"text":"Solid sushi with plenty of bang for you buck! No seriously, I dropped nine dollars (tax in) for the L4 lunch special here today and I walked out with a huge bag of food. Someone doesn't really like the environment because it is plastic and Styrofoam aplenty but I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. 10% off take out! 

The three sushi chefs at the sushi bar are young, in constant motion and know their stuff. Every roll I've had has been very fresh and very tasty. It's all pretty good and standard. Not too inventive of a menu but all your favorites will be there. Pretty quick with the take-out too. 

A while ago I had AYCE sushi here and I remember that being pretty great- a lot of stuff you wouldn't normally see on the cheaper take out menu (ex. butterfish sushi). 

Note: Today, I saw a waitress drop a spoon for someone's ice cream on the floor, run it under water for a several seconds and then put it back in the bowl. Not saying that I wouldn't do this in my house, because I would and I do, but I'm not really sure that's appropriate for a restaurant. Especially since the offending spoon was dropped in a high traffic area. 

Anywho, I'll be back for to stuff myself to the gills with these tasty, Japenese delights."}
{"text":"I get take out from here almost weekly. The food is consistently good. The service is quick and the sashimi is fresh no matter what time of day I order. I recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood for simple and quick take out."}
{"text":"This is such a great sushi place with an amazing all you can eat menu. Definetly worth going back to again and certainly not a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"The only impressive fact about this place is their Boston Rolls which my husband and I really like. They have a good all you can eat selection, however I am not a fan of their sushi because it doesn't taste fresh and it's cold and dry. A few times I noticed water inside their salad dressing which made the dressing taste horrible."}
{"text":"For $20 AYCE, this is pretty good value for money. They have a large selection of sushi and rolls, but very few sashimi options (no tuna; crab stick is not sashimi in my opinion). The problem is that when we ordered a few dishes from the kitchen (tempura, edaname, grilled squid, eggplant, etc.) none of them were good (just salt, grease and sugar) and the waitress brought out a large amount at a time. So for three of us dining, the kitchen staff assumes that we ordered for three, when in fact only one of us wanted an item and marked one (1) in the menu. So we ended up eating more of the greasy food and less sushi. This strategy probably worked in favour of the owner, who may lose money on sashimi. So I recommend communicating clearly with the waiter how much of the non-sushi item you want when marking it on the sheet.  Also, the bathroom could be cleaner."}
{"text":"All you can eat buffet.  Major yum.  The dinner buffet has different dishes than at lunch.    The dinner is better if you like shrimp and squid.  And I love shrimp and squid. One of my favourite buffets - everything is made fresh.  And their sushi is of respectable quality.  I would rate their sushi 7/10; it's not just good but very good; but not excellent; but hey the price is right.  You have to eat all you order or they charge you a surcharge for everything you didn't eat which I think is fair to avoid waste and to keep prices reasonable.  I like their garden salad, salmon sashimi, unagi sushi, ikayaki which is grilled squid (aka calamari), and their shrimp tempura.  Although their waitresses don't speak perfect english, they are helpful and efficient which is great in my books.  If you have the buffet I would highly recommend you go at least with one other person for their buffet, so you get a better variation; ideally 3 or 4."}
{"text":"Decent experience and standard AYCE. Some of the rolls were not put well together, but there's nothing wrong with the taste."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I might be going a bit harsh with only a 3 star review. 
I've dined at my fair share of AYCE (All You Can Eat... for the uninitiated) sushi restaurants and this location doesn't stand out for me as either above or below average. Everything was good but not great. Nothing was disappointing but nothing surprised me with it's quality. 

A friend and I showed up here on a Saturday night to an empty restaurant. It seemed like more people came here to pick up rather than sit down. The ambience of the dining space was definitely lacking with some poor lighting and a lack of decor (at least at the front of the restaurant where we sat). Our orders came out relatively quickly and as far as I could tell we got everything we ordered, no more and no less (some other sushi places often mess up the large AYCE orders). Maybe this was just because it was a slow night, but I'd like to think they just have good staff. The rolls and sushi were what you would expect from any AYCE sushi place. They were tasty but unimpressive. I was a LITTLE sad about the quality of the salmon sashimi we ordered. Again, it wasn't bad, but it just seemed a bit less fresh than other restaurants I've eaten at. The price was alright for the wide selection they offered, maybe a touch less expensive than I've seen elsewhere (~$50 for the two of us together). 

I wouldn't say it's the best AYCE sushi in Toronto, not really even that close, but it is a fine place to catch a meal with some friends if you're in the area and pining for some tasty Japanese fare!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in ALL of Toronto. Like its the best... ever! And the best part is... its all u can eat!
 wooo who!
Everything from the avacado rolls to the shrimp tempura is amazing. At most sushi places after the 1st serving the taste of the stuff gets blan and grose but everything here is just amazing, food wise.
And the price is great!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????fusion??????????xxx????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????staff??????????????????????????-_-"}
{"text":"This is your typical AYCE Sushi joint and you do get what you pay for but considering the area and the quality of food (for AYCE), we've never been disappointed. Aside from the rather disappointing wine selection (when I used to drink).

The selection is good, service can be touch and go sometimes but overall we enjoy almost every time we've been there. The selection for AYCE sashimi is actually better than most but the main reason we love this place is the seaweed salad. We simply can't get enough. 

We've been here many times and never once have they ever charged us the automatic 15% gratuity. People do know that they need not pay that 15% if they disagree? it's not law."}
{"text":"Woman did not even turn around to hand me take out food and continued to talk to colleagues."}
{"text":"Customer service. Customer service. Customer service. This place has absolutely no concept or understanding of customer service. Usually, a place will have a big handful of people that can really deliver on the basis of customer service, then you have a couple bad apples that ruin it. At Aji Sai, it's like EVERYONE is a bad apple. This place is horrible- but the sushi isn't that bad.

They do have a pretty good selection on their AYCE menu. The selection is pretty good. One thing that I do have to get out there is the fact that their spider roll just tastes ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It was pretty disgusting and I love crab- just not this one. The tempura is always on point. Pretty good sized shrimp tempura and the batter is nice and light and crispy. 

Speed is a hit or miss. I've gotten pretty fast service at times and then other times, I've gotten some pretty slow service. 

I really can't deal with the servers at this place because they are too rude, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been there three times in the last two months on the weekends with an average party of about 8.... and we had a great time! The menu is somewhat extensive with both sushi and non-sushi options. It covers the basics... Generally, I stick to fish, but for those who are not fish lovers there are some nice soups and your typical tempura and meat dishes.  

For lunch, the price for AYCE is $13, which is tremendous value as far as sushi is concerned. Yes, there are a few items obviously missing, don't expect Tuna sashimi or a lot of sashimi for that matter or large shrimp nigiri. But then again, come on, let's be realistic, it's $13. Mind you they do have some shrimp, tuna and some eel makis, which a lot of the AYCE's do not even offer. I am talking of course, about the eel. 

If you go for dinner, I think the price goes up to $20 and of course, with that so does the selection. But for a nice, laid back lunch, you simply cannot go wrong here. 
 
Although I still consider Aji Sai on the low-end price-wise on the sushi totem pole, along Generation Sushi and Sushi On Bloor (meh), I do feel like they are trying to strive for something a bit better. 

No one is going to call this place a full fledged authentic cuisine, it is not, it is however a tasty Japanese simile which is worth having again and again... and for $13 it's great value and at a fraction of what you would pay if you went to an authentic Japanese restaurant. Guu anyone?

It is centrally located and about 3 minutes north of Yonge and Bloor and the decor is simple but straight forward. Also, I have found their service quite good, yes, they do shy a way a bit because like a lot of different Asian restaurants there is always a language barrier among the servers. Also, I think the place is run by Chinese, not Japanese, if that matters to you. I will double check this next time I am there eating my happy heart out."}
{"text":"It's my first time to this place and will be the last time too. I have been to the one on Queen a couple of times and liked it, thinking this one would be of at least similar quality... Anyway, overall it is just much worse, and there seemed to have fewer items on the menu too, and one thing other than its food that really bugged me is: they added 15% tip on the bill without telling me while waiting for me to key in my pin, had I not noticed it I would have put another 15%. Honestly I didn't even think I got 15% worth of service, since everything was slow and cold(not talking about the food, although what I ordered was mostly cold too)."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great all-you-can-eat sushi place for years, and I think I finally found it.  Only $11.99 for the lunch menu, it's definitely on the cheap end.  And, you get a lot of variety offered of maki and sashimi (and other menu items).  The dinner all you can eat menu basically has the whole menu on it.  The sushi was fresh and well made.  And delicious green tea ice cream at the end!

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is actually not bad! I try to stay away from AYCE places cause I always end up eating too much. But my friend wanted to go here so I figured why not give AYCE sushi another shot.

I'd order these menu items again: seaweed salad (but I'd request sauce on side, cause it came kind of drenched in sauce); atlantic smoked salmon roll; fire house roll; black dragon roll; salmon belly; spicy butterfish handroll. I wasn't a fan of: rocknroll maki; squid tempura.

I think I'd actually come back in the future (although probably not for a while)."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I've been to many AYCE sushi places and this one is slightly below average. Their menu selection was nothing special. You will find all your standard stuff. They did a few dishes well, and a few were edible but not good. Notable fails were the kalbi, seafood udon, and stir fried squid. On the other hand, their rock shrimp and rolls were decent. The chicken skewer was good too. 

Service is not note-worthy as you can expect from any Chinese owned place.

Price is reasonable. There are better places but I won't mind coming here again if I'm in the area and want to stuff myself."}
{"text":"Aji Sai is a pretty solid restaurant. 

Our school had a massive trip to the reference library, and hence, approximately 30 students made their way down to Aji Sai at some point during the day. 

My group had arrived first, and were immediately seated. The place looked fairly cramped, but wasn't so bad once we sat down. 

As the store was relatively empty, we got our massive order pretty quickly. The short ribs are really good, and anything tempura was perfect. Crispy, but not immensely oily. The sushi was actually really good quality, and better than other AYCE restaurants I'd been to. Dynamite roll is a must try, along with the spicy salmon roll. 

Once the restaurant got busier though (whole place started getting filled), the wait times for food was quite some time. At first it wasn't noticed, as you spent the waiting time talking with friends, but after a while everybody became anxious. 

Some of our orders never got to us (probably lost with the influx of all the orders), and one of the members of our group even heard the waiters talking in Chinese, saying \"These kids eat too much. We are going to run out of supply. How much longer and how much more food are they going to order?\" 

However, for the price you pay, the food is totally worth it. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unattentive service, poor attention to the food and not worth price.

Came here because we heard good reviews about it, decided to get a la carte for dinner instead of the AYCE, which is $21.99 plus tax. We got the dynamite roll and the diamond sushi set which were pricey. For ordering regular menu items, you'd think that the rolls would be a bit bigger and presented better, but they looked exactly like what you'd get if you were to get AYCE, and the dishes were sloppily put together, like someone just threw it on last minute. Like, really, are you kidding me? If I am paying more for the same thing I can get for AYCE, I'd expect larger portions and better presentations. The taste was nothing special, even the food court sushi down the street tastes better, and we paid like 2x the price. 

If we knew it was going to be like this, we would've gotten AYCE instead. The service was pretty below average too, besides taking our order and getting us water, they didn't come ask about the food or anything, even though the restaurant was kind of empty. Not to mention it was hard to wave someone down. 

Definitely better options in the area, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. The service was slow during lunch hour where most people would be rushing. The servers were really nice but not too attentive. They didnt have spider roll that was on the menu which was a huge dissapointment.  Was not the best visit."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time and the last time I was here was at least 1.5 years ago before I joined the Yelp community.  It's typical AYCE quality, but their best roll is the Firehouse roll. It's essentially a California roll topped with red tuna and tempura flakes with spicy mayo on top.  This was my favourite.  The sushi itself was of average quality.  

I think the positives to this place are: Price - $12.99 for lunch, fairly fast service and the sushi is okay.  

The biggest negatives to this place is that they don't offer dessert, or shrimp tempura and their kitchen items are a bit below average.  

Not worth a special drive, but if you are in the area, it's good for a quick AYCE sushi lunch."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Aji Sai is a good choice downtown for all you can eat sushi. There is a lot of selection on the all you can eat menu - even for those who don't like raw fish. The sushi is what you expect from all you can eat - a bit scaled down versions. The service is so/so. The price is as expected (around $20/person).

Make sure you try the cream cheese won tons and the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Passable.

Was in the area and hoping for a variety, so we opted in for AYCE. Not impressed whatsoever. 
Prices for A La Carte were reasonable, but the quality overall for either option of AYCE or A La Carte was horrible.

There was way too much rice in every piece of sushi, and the pieces of sashimi were super small. Aside from sushi, there were hot items as well like Tenpanyakki and Grilled/Tempura based items, but even those were at most passable.

For $23 a person AYCE, the quality could've been better. Probably will not be back. Definitely worth the additional dollar or so for better quality, and better atmosphere in general."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and alway order for pick up. The food is decent ant always consistent in quality. They are fast and always have my order ready in 10 minutes.  The staff is always pleasant and the service is great. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So many options and delicious flavours to choose from.  I was quite impressed even if service might have been a little slow that day. 

Staff were very accommodating to my friends allergies so that was very much appreciated.  We also had arrived later and they were still good to serve us.  

So many options I didn't have a chance to try them all but I definitely intend to come back to this place because it is comparably better than most."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. I usually go there for their lunch all you can eat - and I am never disappointed with the taste. Their Makis and rolls come with a (rare to find in all you can eat) balance between the rice and other ingredients. Its true they dont have sashimi items on the list, but for that price, I guess they cant!
Im surprised people say they dont have ice cream/desserts with the AYCE - as they do have, its just not on the menu, U have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on a regular week day.  The all you can eat sushi deal looks fun, but opted for something from their takeout menu and ordered the Fire House roll, Red Dragon roll, edamame and the miso soup.  The Fire House roll was by far my favourite, the rest of the order was ok, nothing to write home about.  

Service was meh, but the prices were good.  I will definitely go back to try the All You Can Eat deal next time."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but the last visit changed my experience forever. I arrived at 945pm as Aji Sai closes at 1030. As I arrived I was told the last call for food is 10pm and greeted with an apathetic attitude. I was then asked if I would be finished by 1030 because the boss wasn't here and the staff wanted to leave. They then asked me if they could just \"double\" the kitchen food order well my girlfriend was still looking at the menu. Never been to a restaurant that asks you to leave at the time it closes just horrible."}
{"text":"Similar to other lower quality AYCE places, this sushi place will not provide quality.
I ordered a green salad, Red dragon role, butter fish and salmon Sashimi, edamame and some tempura. The only thing that truly surprised me this time was the green salad! Cause it only consisted of lettuce and dressing. The rolls were miniature rolls as seen in the pic. I would definitely not visit again and don't recommend wasting $20.99 on a weekday for dinner. Once I find a good AYCE sushi would definitely post the review.
And last but certainly not least the salmon teriyaki that was suppose to be belly was a fin plus lil bit of meat left on it"}
{"text":"I've given  Aji Sai three chances, and now I'm done with them. Between \"meh\" sushi, slow, grumpy service, and the fact that you receive about a quarter of the items you order from their all-you-can-eat menu, I don't understand why anyone bothers with this place."}
{"text":"Just north of Bloor St on Yonge is Aji Sai. After seeing some of the yelp reviews it was necessary to pay a visit.  
The place is quite spacious though it may appear small. Our server was helpful and was able to provide me some feedback on what to order on their AYCE menu.
The every dish that came out was beautifully presented. Among notables I admired their green Dragon, salmon avocado hand roll, and cowboy roll.
Their prices listed; lunch is $13.99 and dinner is $19.99 is quite reasonable for the area. 
I've been to a few places around downtown, this place is good and they've got a good selection.
Seating can be quite squished as some of the tables are so close to one another.
Quite a surprise though it's just north of  buddy Bloor and Yonge, it was somehow quiet lol...which is a plus! 
Parking is nearby for those driving and for those taking public transportation, the subway is a skip away.
Good place, I shall revisit if I'm in the area craving sushi."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp, still decided to try because we were craving for AYCE and its in the neighborhood. It turned out to be a very big disappointment. First of all, for dinner AYCE menu is only 5 kinds of sashimi, which is pretty limited the choice. Secondly, all their chicken dish has a weird fridge taste. Thirdly, by the time we were finished, there are 4 pieces of sushi rolls on the plate, out of the 20 that we ordered, the waitress basically forced us to eat it otherwise she will charge us $2.00 each, then she went back to her counter to gossip about this to her boss. At that point, I just no longer want to order further and just wanted the bill. When we got the bill, there is a default 15% tips which the service itself does not deserve it."}
{"text":"Not bad for an AYCE sushi joint. The selection is fair and price is average ($20.99 on Fri-Sun dinner) but food poor.  I found the fish:rice a little too much and food was on the bland side. 

Liked:
- Shrimp & calamari tempura
- BBQ eel (unagi) sushi
- Volcano roll
- Spicy salmon sushi
- Butter fish sashimi
- Red tuna sushi

Disliked:
- Yakitori (it was a large piece of dried out chicken deep fried)
- Snapper and salmon sashimi (bland)
- Steak teriyaki (chewy and dry)
- Selection of rolls (almost 90% of the rolls consisted of tempura bits)
- Agedashi tofu (cold and tasted weird)
- Salmon teriyaki (they only had the neck & belly)
- Udon (not the Japanese ones so very hard)
- Soy sauce (Worst part of my experience. They use the cheap Chinese brands so it's salty as ever. It made everything taste bad!!!)

Unlikely to return!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi but SLOOOOOW service. At both their yonge and queen locations. Also our servers never seemed happy to serve us and when asked questions I'd get a grunt or mumbles in reply. Had to ask for tea at least 3 times. I'll be back tho because I'm addicted to sushi and this place is very decent. 

Try the spider roll!! And fried banana with your ice cream!"}
{"text":"I will give it a zero! Dont come to this place . It sucks. The staff is very rude and they are always observing what people do in scary way. ( mean looks) .It is definately not a comfortable place to eat . I felt like i was in a zoo. The waitress takes your plates away when you are still eating, they add their own tip which is about 15% with the bill plus when you are paying with a credit/debit card the machine asks you to give another tip. They make us pay double tip when they gave us the most terrifying and bad service."}
{"text":"I've always gone to the Queen Street location instead of the Yonge location but today I chose to come here since I was in the area. It is a lot smaller. The service style is different since they provide a checklist of the AYCE menu which is not as diverse with the choices but at least it still kept the special rolls. My coworkers and I sort of overordered so by the end we had 16 unfinished pieces. To avoid getting charged a freakish amount for it, I quickly asked the waiter if I could take it to go instead. The to go charge was an extra $5 to the bill which was fine by all of us. 

We ordered:
Miso Soup
Green/Black Dragon Roll
Mango Avocado Roll
Fire House Roll
Rock n' Roll
Alaska Roll
Sushi Pizza
Chicken Teriyaki
Gyoza 
Cheese Wontons
Shrimp & Squid Tempura
Vegetable Tempura
Dynamite Roll

Just a quick note, every item after sushi pizza...I don't have pictures for because those idiots devoured them before I got pictures of it. I manage to get the others because they all ran to the washroom lol"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night, restaurant was empty with one server. Food came fairly quick, everything was hot and to temperature. My only complaint is how annoying the server was coming over to our table to micromanage what we eat, she kept saying if you don't finish this dish well charge you! And when we ordered dessert, she wouldn't bring it until we \"cleared our food\"! How rude! They also added an autograt of 15%!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested me to come to this place and tbh I'm really disappointed. The presentation and taste of many kitchen food were really bad. Seaweed salad looks nothing like the thin green stands that I am used to. Sushi rolls were pretty average as well. Oh and no shrimp tempura and ice cream desserts like any other AYCE lunch menu."}
{"text":"Let's just start out saying that I am disappointed with this place after reading reviews that it's a good place.

I went for dinner (around 7pm) on a weeknight and found them semi-busy.  That's a good sign that the fish doesn't sit too long.

I ordered the all you can eat (ayce) for $18.99 and was given a menu and 2 different ordering sheets.  The first thing that I noticed was that you didn't get limited on how much sashimi you could order.  The bad thing is that the rolls come in 6's or 8's only which is terrible if you dine alone or have only 2 at the table.  They should allow smaller portions so that you are able to try more food.

Here is my review of the following:
Salmon Sashimi - pretty fresh tasting and decent size!  Ate 12 pcs!
Spicy Tuna Hand roll - wasn't spicy and not much taste
Seafood Soup - don't order it. just fish bits, mushrooms and 2 small pieces of squid
Spider Roll - seemed like the crab was deep fried a long time ago
Tempura Roll - tasted ok but the tempura wasn't fresh
Spicy Tuna/Salmon roll - decent
Mango Icecream - probably my 2nd favourite dish after the sashimi

As you can see, I didn't get to try too much since the rolls filled me right up!

Finally, the service.  It really, really sucked!  I had to ask a couple of times for my tea to be refilled.  Also had to wait awhile before they came to take my order sheet.  I noticed that the younger waitress had the time to talk to the sushi chef rather than serve her guests.  It even took time for my bill too!

I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"I don't care how affordable this place is, you're getting exactly the quality that you're paying for. Went there with a friend last night for dinner & drinks. Between us both we ordered oysters ($1/ea with the purchase of a drink), the \"must-try\" spicy squid tentacles, the salmon crackers and the vegetable tempura. The oysters were AWFUL - served only slightly colder than room temperature and all the shells full of melted ice water. This was SO bad that my friend and I, huge fans of oysters, didn't even finish our orders. The \"must-try\" squid tentacles were overcooked and over-battered, making them not only chewy, but hard as well. The only thing that hadn't been screwed up was the vegetable tempura, and I imagine you'd have to be pretty hard-pressed to really mess up deep-fried vegetables.

Our (main) server was really nice, and offered us 10% off for our unfinished oysters. However he explained that this resto has just recently come under new management and are still working out the kinks. He also explained that between the English/Korean/Chinese waitstaff and the Mandarin-speaking cooks, there is often a communication issue. I hope that this is indeed the sole issue, and one they can fix. I, however, will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Pretty good mid-downtown AYCE. Food is yummy.
GET THE BUSHIDO ROLL. Sashimi was all good, AND THEY HAD SABA SASHIMI.

Service is pretty shit though. Asked for cups of tea 3 or 4 times before it ever came (other people were served tea, so they had the stuff ready)."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi lunch"}
{"text":"Updating my review here! Unfortunately it's bad news.

I've been slowly coming less and less here. I've been on two dates here for dinner service (normal menu) and although the dates were months apart, and I bought two completely different dishes, I was up all night SICK. Like, throwing up sick.

Today I came back for AYCE, which is my favourite thing to do at this location for lunch.

I crave their green salad, but today it tasted sour and was much more watery than usual. I found some lettuce that had brown spots and other large bits didn't seemed to be washed. I ate it to be polite but it was super off putting.

The shrimp tempura in my roll was soft and rubbery. Like eating a sponge almost :( it also had a strange taste but I don't know if it was because of the salad prior.

Everything else I had was fine, other than the chicken teriyaki, which was tasteless and basically weird fatty bits. Like all of the pieces from the chicken you don't want.

They have changed the seats in here though, as before they had seen better days. I have no complaints about the wait staff because they are always pleasant to me. Shame about the food quality, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I didn't like at all my experience there, the service was really shitty, the waitresses looked like they ran out of fucks to give, after ordering my order took a reeeeeally long time to come and when it came the rice in the sushi was warm! 

After sitting down the atmosphere was so not welcoming I wanted to go away immediately but I stayed and even than, after the order came I could only think about eating the faster I could so I can go away 

TBH besides the ward rice the food was not that bad but the atmosphere was so heavy I would not want to go back"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a friend. They sat us at a table, and I noticed a dead fly on my plate. As the waiter sat us, he noticed it also. He took the plate, and the tried to throw the dead fly on the floor without us noticing. He didn't replace the plate. I told him that I saw the dead fly, but he said that our server will get us another plate. 

We obviously left the restaurant. Poor service means poor quality food. DON'T EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"- Used to be my go to cheat day spot. Not anymore.
- Quality has dropped significantly as has the service.
- Dinner is a bit more expensive but definitely the better choice. More variety and for some reason, ingredients seem a bit more fresh.
- Salmon rose - my favorite item on the menu. Used to over order on this very item.
- Wakame salad used to be great. Now its just very dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"bad service, the waitresses were rude and ignored us. the food was decent although the sushi did seem a bit unfresh and warm (sushi is typically cold)."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: This is the only All-you-can-eat sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto as of this review

After going here twice, I can say it's enjoyable. It's got everything you would need in an all-you-can-eat sushi resto:
- Fast, reliable service even during peak lunch time (12pm)
- Solid selection of sushi, rolls, and the usual sides
- Rice is not mushy, done well enough
- Great price ($11 + tax)

Overall, if you're in the area and hankering for some sushi this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"AYCE, so don't expect sushi to serve your royal guests at your dinner party.  But for $13 for lunch I can easily get my money's worth."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi.  You get a checklist and check off all the stuff you want to eat.  It tasted pretty good for an all you can eat.  I liked the sushi pizza.


Beware, you have to pay the menu price for items you do not eat.  I do not mind this.  In fact, I encourage it.  Charge double.  People need to realize that food isn't free, and if you don't like it, it isn't an excuse not to eat it (think eating at your own house).  Only time it is acceptable is if it is not fresh.

Overall, I liked it."}
{"text":"This place is literally around the corner from my apartment and I'm in love with it. They're ingredients are always fresh. 

Tips:

1. Get the Wakame Salad if you like seaweed salad. It's heavenly! 

2. Sometimes they add 15% gratuity to the bill even if you're a party is less than 8 people, so check your bill. 

3. Get there early for lunches - can get super busy!"}
{"text":"Ever gone into a restaurant and have one of the friends you're with create a bit of a fuss with the waitress and you spend the rest of the evening wondering if the staff will spit in your food?

Welcome to my evening. Thanks to a pretty innocent misinterpretation on what was going on, we started off on a bad note with the waitress. So I'd first like to say how professional and polite the staff was to us despite this. Serving people is a tough job and this restaurant did a good job of serving us well. 

The food is pretty typical of All-You-Can-Eat. The quality is pretty decent but nothing mind-blowing. I personally felt the quality was better than most. The selection was particularly surprising and I was pretty pleased with the selection of hand rolls and regular/special rolls. If you feel like meat, this place hits the spot pretty decently as well. They have nice Chinese dishes and interesting cheese wonton bites. 

I do have to say I haven't been to many AYCEs in Toronto, but compared to what I'm used to I thought it was quite solid and reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"Other than the speed at which the food came out at, it is not good. Sushi was stale. Shrimp tempura in dynamite roll did not taste fresh and the rolls are very small."}
{"text":"I'd leave zero stars if I could. I ordered from them on just-eat and they left out my tempura. When I called them to rectify the situation they were not helpful at all, acted as though they couldn't care less. The owner was horrible to me! After feeling mocked over the phone I told her I'd call her back and when I did, no one picked up. When the customer service rep at just-eat also tried to contact them they didn't pick up. Now onto the food: one of the special rolls I ordered had TWO pieces. Such a rip-off. The seafood udon had bland, overcooked pieces of fish and shrimp that they had clearly just thrown in with the same amount of carelessness they display in their customer service. The chilled tofu was bland and drenched in a ton of sesame oil. I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because it is supposedly the \"best\" AYCE sushi in Toronto. 

The one word to describe my experience here is \"disgruntled\". The quality of the sushi isn't bad, per se, but the whole experience left me vowing to not come back. For the record, Kyoto House on Dundas is much cheaper and has better quality. 

The quality of service was virtually non-existent, making it very difficult for me to even muster a 10% tip. 

I found a fruit-fly and a piece of plastic in my Udon soup. Upon telling the server, she gave me this \"what do you want me to do\" look, without even attempting to make amends. 

I left the meal feeling nauseous, furious and wondering whether my stomach was going to survive this ordeal."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here. This time around, by a fortunate mistake, I ordered a sushi combo that included sashimi. My first time eating sashimi and I liked it. Fresh and filling."}
{"text":"I am a regular to this location!!! I have to say I love this place...fast service & the food is mouth-watering out of this world. AYCE lunch is $15 (new price increase) & dinner is $20 (new price increase). Must try the Rocking shrimp..."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is advertised outside as all you can eat $12.99. 
We sat down at 3:30pm. Although the service was ok we were served the dinner menu without being told so and when this was brought to the attention of the waitress at the end of the meal, she informed us that last call was at 2:30pm... Not sure how we're supposed to guess. We offered her a chance to correct the situation and get the manager but she preferred to refer us to the fine print on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and I went there with my friend, I like Wakame salad so much Tufu steak also good but mango salad is very awful for me . Miso soup also good too and their service is good , I like all of them just one girl who has a moody face and angry with us. My friend ordered kimchi beef fried after she ate 1 bite , she returned it back . She said it's not delicious. I didn't eat much because I was full easily. I went there Saturday afternoon the price is 16.97$"}
{"text":"This place has to be my favourite all you can eat sushi place, and  they do a great job with a la carte too.

This location feels nicer than the Queen West location. It isn't so brightly lit, and is quieter- conspicuously absent are the same 10  muzak tracks playing on repeat. They also have a checklist ordering system, so fewer items are forgotten or \"forgotten\". The rolls are also slightly different than the Queen location, with some choices added, some taken away, and others formulated differently. I believe that they use a different teriyaki sauce as well.

To start, there is a huge variety of sushi, sashimi and maki, ranging from the traditional to on-the-spot creations. The Fire House Roll (tuna, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo and mango) is surprisingly delicious. The Cowboy Roll (beef and green onion) is delicious too. The fish is quite fresh, as are the grilled meats, and the seaweed salad is awesome too.

A la carte, you have more choices, and the rolls are more carefully crafted (the AYCE ones can be somewhat rice heavy, although not as much as other locations and restaurants).

Overall, Aji Sai is great food in  a great environment, and an excellent value for your money!http://www.yelp.ca/writeareview/biz/cPzIic1AqH1ApTVVaww5hw?return_url=%2Fuser_details_reviews_self%3Fuserid%3DyGuE8QzNotZCFirfweR1Fg%26rec_pagestart%3D0&review_id=g3WPH7aUTT1cUrx3vw5AuQ#"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here because Ritual had a deal. Chicken teriyaki with rice, soup, salad, 2 spring rolls and 3 pieces of California maki for 5 bucks. Decent deal but the food and service was another story. 

I came on time but still had to wait 10 minutes (this is in addition to 10 minutes that Ritual told me to go). When I got there, the restaurant had 2-3 tables so they weren't that busy. I saw my order and all it was missing was the maki. The sushi chef took forever to get started even though I didn't see him make any other rolls in the time I was waiting. The servers were even telling him that I needed the rolls but he dgaf. Finally, they packed up my food but didn't give me a spoon for the soup.

The food itself was bland, the teriyaki sauce was thick and bland, too much corn starch (or whatever thickening agent) was used. The chicken was dry and chewy. Salad was warm. Best part of the meal? The 3 pieces of sushi I waited so long for."}
{"text":"This location has better food than the one at Queen. I mean don't expect gourmet sushi, ok? But it is delicious. It was cheap, good food, ok service. Its a small place as well so may not be ideal for big groups. 3 stars. B - rating."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED, closed, CLOSED!!!!!!

In mid December 2017 this location was replaced by Dumpling Fresh Express.  The inside (except for a preparation area in the front window) has remained SO SIMILAR that when I was there a couple came in and were perplexed about why they menu had changed :)  :)  They left feeling a little embarrassed after drinking the tea.

It's sad that the owners of this place seem to have stopped caring about this place.  If you search the Yelp reviews for this place sorted chronologically - you will notice that the quality of this place dropped off a cliff starting about 6 months ago.

Sad - because I liked this place.

There are several other locations - Queen Street, and the Danforth?

Good Bye Aji Sai."}
{"text":"Walking to this location from Eaton Centre, I worked up quite an appetite for All You Can Eat at $18.99 instead of the A La Carte option.

We were seated right away as I had made reservations in advance. Looking at the menu, there wasn't much selection but I still managed to grab some of my favorites.  
When the food came out, it seems like they got all of our numbering wrong and just gave us everything we ordered but in a portion that would feed the whole table. 

In a way it could be a good thing but not when the table may not be in agreement with some choices. All the meat looked and tasted like it was drenched in sauce and nothing really stood out.

Overall, it was descent for a downtown all you can eat price and it's at a very convenient and accessible location."}
{"text":"I paid my first visit here with a fried recently for lunch.
The food is decent compared to the price (12.99 AYCE). The variety of dishes in  AYCE menu is average, no sashimi though. The pieces were of a good bite size, not too big that doesn't fit in the mouth. Not too much rice to fill  you up fast either. The fish were fresh and of good quality. I got to try butterfish for the first time and really enjoyed it. Every thing was delicious.

Service is not superb but is OK. Wait time was short. And it has average seating area. 

One thing that I must say, because it is really important, is that a tiny bug find its way some how to my dish and when I notified the server she only took my plate away and brought a new one! Definitely gross"}
{"text":"This Aji Sai a tiny place on Yonge St. just north of Bloor.  There is another affiliated location on Yonge St. SOUTH of Bloor that's much larger but the AYCE menus are different, as are the AYCE hours.

I like THIS Aji Sai WAY better than the one further south, although I have been to both many times.  This Aji Sai is small and intimate, quiet, and seems much more sophisticated and professional.  The service is great and so is the sushi chef.

Sushi rolls are great, good balance with rice and ingredients, well-made.  The variety on the AYCE menu is good, I like the sesame chicken a lot and the general tao.  The sauces are tangy and tasty.  

Only thing is that they don't have dessert on the AYCE -- at the south location they have several on theirs."}
{"text":"Fairly standard not too expensive sushi. I've eaten here a dozen times out of convenience and some days are pretty bad, some days are better. Likely depends on their shipment of fish.
It's fine for what it is, but don't expect fine dining.
The staff are nice though we typically ordered take-out."}
{"text":"if i could...i would rate this place -5 stars 
i can't believe that a place like this is still in business
me and a bunch of friends went to this place, in search of a good ayce place. 
sadly when we ordered our sushi, they decided to place salt in some of the pieces of the sushi, after arguing for five minutes with the waitress(lanuage barrier) she took the pieces away and decided not to charge us. 
as well we has piece with sugar in it, and pieces with avacado in it as well. which were not advertised on the menu. 
i'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Saturday lunch AYCE for $12.99 from 11:30-3:00. 

I'm one of 6 tables up front with room for ~35 people. I hope weekends are slow and this is not representative of the quality of fish I just ordered. For 13 bucks, it's worth trying. A few more parties flowed in until almost all tables were filled on the floor by 2:00. 

Out of Butter fish :(
Snapper, salmon and Saba sushi
Spicy Yellowtail hand roll
Red Dragon roll
Californian Rainbow roll
Black Dragon roll
Dynamite roll
all decent. 

The rice is a bit undercooked an crispy at times. The fish was cold (very important to me) but paper thin but that's to be expected with all you can eat. That said, it was good. Very good when I think about what I spent. 

Service is fast but I can do without the Kiss 92.5 music and would prefer more authentic or mellow lunchtime tunes. All in all, you get what you pay for. I would never come at dinner but for lunch, it's worth it."}
