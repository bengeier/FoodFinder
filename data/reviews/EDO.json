{"text":"I came here for groupon deal and we were seated right the way. My waitress serve us the water in 15 mins and I kept asking them to provide me the regular menu (I planned to order some other dishes too), waited 30 mins and kept asking, still no menu!!!!!

I've waited more than 45 mins for my first dish / drink. This is the worst Japanese meal experience. I ordered the sake and my waitress tole me out of stock. She opened another one before telling me this is not what I ordered. 

Later, there is another waitress (Japanese girl?) served me with much better service. She found out the sake that the other waitress gave me is totally different than the one I ordered. She apologized and send back the premium sake I asked for.

The food was okay, but you must be very patient on every dishes.  Average we have to wait 15-20 mins for each dish.  It is worth to wait for the main dish - black cod or Kobe beef. The beef was okay but we both very like the black cod. It is juicy and tender, their five grain rice is very chewy too!!  The best leave the last!!!

Overall, it is an okay experience. I believe I would have better experience with a better waitress."}
{"text":"Edo is one of my favourite Japanese restaurant! Especially, pre-fix or tasting menu is incredible!! Some of them are fusion and it worked very well. Since I am tired of regular Japanese dishes in other restaurants, I loved their special tasting menu at occasion. Teriyaki at other restaurants is usually very sweet and it isn't traditional teriyaki taste from Japan. The chef in Edo is from Japan, so he knows what he is doing. Sushi tastes sooooo good! I am from Japan, I can tell the difference between so-so Sushi and real Sushi. What made me surprised was my husband loved the food at Edo! He has never a big fan of Japanese foods but he loved them! Seafoods and Kobe beef are amazing! If you want to try, check Summerlicious and Winterlicious menu. It is more affordable, I think."}
{"text":"Higher end japanese fusion. Fresh quality food. You're always greeted with a hot hand towel and a tiny (free) starter noodle salad. It's best to order everything at once, as it comes as it's made."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a casual lunch.

Food: 5/5
I went here for lunch and had the chicken teriyaki, a maki roll and a bottle of sake. The chicken teriyaki came with a fresh miso soup, small salad with delicious dressing, and regular teriaki box. The tempura was noteworthy with seaweed, sweet potato and shrimp. Everything seemed to have been made with intense attention to detail and was quite delicious.

Service/Ambiance/Decor: 3/5
Friendly and knowledgeable, nothing exceptional though."}
{"text":"Like most other reviewers I came here with my family for a groupon deal.  We had the three course Kobe beef steak dinner and while it wasnt bad it was hardly impressive.  They served a trio of appetizers to start and it was by far the best of the three courses.  it consisted of sunomono with glass noodle, mini dynamite roll wrapped in soy paper, and salmon tartar.  The sunomono was my favourite and the dynamite roll was pretty good as well.  It left a good impression on me but the rest of the meal proceeded to disappoint.  The main course of the Kobe beef steak was pretty much an average steak, cooked to medium rare the meat wasn't tender (it wasn't tough either, just extremely so so) and was lacking in flavour.  It was no better than a steak at your average steakhouse.  Moving on, I've learned to not expect much of dessert in fixed menus but green tea affogato sounds delicious, right?  What they served was not affogato, it was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with green tea sauce, successfully preventing the steak from being the most disappointing dish...yay?  The meal wasn't bad and the price was acceptable with the groupon discount, but the experience was so disappointing that even our very attentive waitress and above average appetizers could save."}
{"text":"Over-rated. Sushi and maki were fine - but you can get that anywhere. Everything was Ã  la carte, which seems pretentious in a Japanese restaurant. The \"large\" salad was not large. And the chicken teriyaki sauce was the saltiest I've ever tasted - and didn't even taste like teriyaki sauce. Grilled tofu was tasteless. Next.
PS you have this resto listed twice, so you need to merge them!"}
{"text":"My first and only visit to this restaurant to date was as a result of the Groupon offer of a dinner for two for $72.  The meal is pretty much explained by Angelo B below, but apparently he likes large portions and can eat like a horse, because we, a foodie and chef, were more than stuffed. Having eaten East Asian food all over the 905, I would have to say that this restaurant blew us away on the quality and presentation of the Japanese menu. The best Japanese is Markham/Richmond Hill.

Unfortunately, what was really lacking was the service. The female waitresses (we were sporadically served by three or four of them) lacked management and direction, and were all over the place making absolutely ridiculous mistakes and were inattentive. The restaurant was maybe half full, and they seemed to struggle and tried to do everything.

Luckily, we were waited mainly by a male waiter (I believe, of East Indian descent) who was fabulous. His service was akin to that of what you get in fine dining, Michelin-starred restaurants. 

Once this restaurant is able to better manage front of house, which is a letdown for the food served, this restaurant will shine."}
{"text":"We went before a show. It's a beautiful restaurant, with an intimate atmosphere.  The food was excellent.  We ordered sushi and sashimi combinations, and the fish was fresh and tasty. Presentation was impeccable.  Service was initially stiff, but improved as the night went on.  

As professional/graduate students, it was slightly steep for us (over $100 for two), but well worth it for a special night out."}
{"text":"Intro: winterlicious, table for 4

Pro:
- food was good, not very impressive though
- seated us quickly
- we were here so long, parking became free after 9
- clean and cozy environment

Con: 
- super slow service (reservation was at 7, didn't leave until 9:45pm. 20 min wait for each course.)
- waitress forgot to get/refill our water 3 times
- washroom is in the basement

... All 4 of us will not come back."}
{"text":"Well OK it's because of the groupon deal, we give edo a try with not much of expectation after seeing most yelp reviews. It's marketed on groupon as a 5 course  tasting menu but the overall presentation, flavor  and quality were in a low grade. I decided not to write about the details about the 5 courses because it doesn't worth my time but at least I think is important as a yelp users to share my reviews here. I mean, if you've already got the groupon you will go anyway. I don't really want to further ruin your expectations. 
I was going to give only 2 stars but the service was not too bad, the staff was attentive, friendly and explain all the dishes very well. They have 3 other locations but I doubt I will try any of the others anyway. There is far more better real Japanese cuisine in Toronto with way better quality and menu choices."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, price is fair. Great service"}
{"text":"We ate the Summerlicious dinner menu for 4.

The food is well made and the service is very well done. However it seems the air conditioning was broken (or malfunctioning), which distracted the dining experience as we have to fan ourselves between courses. We booked at 6:15pm (which is the earliest until 8:45), but throughout the dinner up until we left at 8:30, the resturant was barely half-full, makes me wonder if they are subtly trying to deter diners using this site (or summerlicious diners?) to reserve seats for the prime dinner hours.

My father ordered the steakloin main dish and he find the meat portion too small, but for the rest of us choosing the tempura one it's enough.

Not sure if I planned to return outside of summerlicious."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional. Sashimi was fresh and generous. Service attentive and knowledgeable and not overbearing."}
{"text":"Worst food surprise when they presented a burnt salmon filet to my table!  How do you even think of putting that on a plate and then to the table?!  We sent it back and had to complain again because it took another 20 minutes to get a new dish while the rest of our table finished their meal.  Then the kicker, they had the nerve to charge us for that dish!  Any place that gives a round of service like that will certainly see their business crash...and fast.  There's soo many other places to eat in Toronto - cross this one off your list."}
{"text":"Expensive, but worthwhile. The food is top-notch; even the green tea is absolutely delicious. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to Japanese food, but at Edo they pretty much blew me away. Everything tasted amazing, and the service was very good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"*4.5 stars

Booked a Summerlicious reservation on a Sunday night, which was moderately busy but not packed nor any waiting customers. Decor was classy and had a romantic ambience to it.

Really enjoyed the restaurant, from the food to the service. I was curious to see how this meal would be worth $35/person, but for 4.5 courses and after the meal, I thought it was worth it and would consider coming back. I even found their regular menu prices to not be overly expensive (although pricier than your average sushi joint)... and coming from an asian used to cheap eats, that's definitely a bonus. 

As soon as I was seated, they gave a palm-sized plate of a refreshing cucumber noodle salad. I'm not a fan of cucumber, but it had seaweed and a bit of sesame mixed in with fine cucumber slices and what tastes like yam noodle. After a few minutes, we were given a complimentary 'amuse', which this time around was a handroll, except used a rice wrap with avocado and shrimp laid on some rice on the inside sprinkled with tempura bits, spicy sauce, and sesame seeds. Absolutely delicious. It tasted like sushi and definitely 'wetted' our appetite.

APPETIZER:  
I ordered the salmon tataki, which was a bit of seared salmon in a yuzu sauce. The sauce was a little overpowering if you dabbed too much of it, but the fish was really tasty and very fresh indeed. I was also pleasantly surprised that the portion was quite generous, ~5-6 pieces of salmon (and not like 2 pieces as per usual gourmet portions), so I was quite happy about that. My boyfriend ordered the sliced duck in soba noodles (which were green) and he really liked it. I found it decent also, perhaps slightly salty, but tasty and a good-sized portion.

OMAKASE SUSHI SET:
This was a 5-piece sushi set that made the Summerlicious menu 4 courses instead of 3. I really liked this addition. I had 2 papaya maki rolls (which had a spicy sauce that made it delicious - and I usually hate papaya), a surf clam sushi with a sweet sauce, a salmon rose with green roe on top, and another fish sushi with a peanut-sesame sauce. They don't serve these with soy sauce, which was unique, and I appreciated that experience because the sushi really didn't need it - it was quite flavourful as is and you could really appreciate the freshness of the fish.

*EXTRA*
We ordered a spicy salmon roll because it said it was an Edo classic and had their tempera bits and spicy Dynamite sauce trademarked, so I said, we have to try it! Unfortunately this was a little typical compared to our wonderful East meets West-inspired meal so far, although there were a few pros. The seaweed used to wrap the sushi is great (as someone who makes sushi having solid non-musty tasting seaweed is important). The rolls were also very soft and again, fish was very fresh. But yes, a little on the small side and a bit typical... but really good spicy sauce (I guess that's why its trademarked!)

MAINS:
I had the Kobe beef lasagna. Unfortunately this was a let-down. Don't get me wrong, it was absolutely delicious.... as a lasagna, but a totally disappointment because there was the 'Kobe beef' advertisement. I should have realized that it would be difficult to really distinguish it as Kobe beef if it's all ground up and overpowered by tomato sauce, but sadly, it only hit me when I took the first bite. Had it not listed it as 'Kobe beef lasagna' on the menu, it'd just taste like a decent lasagna using regular ground beef found at any Italian establishment. 

On the other hand, my boyfriend was really satisfied with the grilled seafood salad. He thought the shrimp in particular was really sweet and everything was perfectly grilled. Now I tasted that there was pesto sauce in the salad and it was generally a good salad... but it was very Italian. Basically the mains were not very Japanese at all, and were comparable to ordering an Italian dish. I was expecting more fusion between the two cuisines, not 90% Italian... so while I enjoyed it, I had to dock a star because of it. 

DESSERT:
My favourite course - I ordered the green tea tiramisu and my, I could eat 3 of those. It was a true delight! It had a nice whipped cream sprinkled with matcha powder with tiramisu spongecake at the bottom of the cup. So when you use your spoon to dip in - it is like heaven. It also came with a matcha-sprinkled biscuit and some fresh berries. Overall a light and refreshing dessert that I savoured to the max.

My boyfriend had the black sesame panna cotta. He fully enjoyed it also. It was sort of like a black sesame paste with gold flakes on top... but he scraped the little bowl like no tomorrow and stated that it was a must-have dessert for any black sesame lovers. Dessert was a home run for the two of us and both these desserts deserve a thumbs up.

SERVICE:
Great! Our water was filled frequently, they were fast taking our used plates, and our waiter consistently asked us how our food was."}
{"text":"Don't understand some of the negative reviews below, particularly the one from the girl who claims that she is \"put off by fish.\" Not exactly clear why she went to Edo in the first place ...

I go to sushi restaurants all the time, and Edo is consistently the best for this particular service tier. The sashimi is always fresh, the tempura crisp and light (not soggy or overcooked as in many other places), the rice clean and perfectly textured. This place is my go-to choice, even though I have to drive across town to get there."}
{"text":"When my dad goes to the gym here (personal trainer session), my mom and I will usually have dinner here waiting for him to finish. Always a pleasant experience and never busy.

Love the sashimi as it's always fresh, and I have to say, the selection of 300ml sake's here are amazing. You have your signature rolls here, hand rolls, and Chicken/Beef/Salmon Teriyaki. My mom loves the Gindara with a bowl of rice.

Service here is very friendly and obliging. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you happen to be staying here, or waiting for someone to finish their gym!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious and was impressed by the food. The salmon tataki is to die for, and the flavors of the other dishes were all amazing. The sushi platter was delicious, the kobe burger was juicy,  the sweet potato fries were crispy and battered with just the right amount of tempura, and the seafood pasta tasted like Japan (if Japan had a taste). I definitely recommend this place for anyone who loves trying out fusion dishes."}
{"text":"Not very good portions are tiny, white radish was mushy and tasted like it was rotten. I mentioned this to the server and she told me that I was not supposed to eat it! In 35 years I have never heard that you are not to each the white radish on the plate, anyhow I told it tasted rotten and again she told me that I was not supposed to eat it! Why would they put rotten food on a plate. She should have been trained a simple sorry and I will look into it would have been fine. Her argumentative attitude just cost her a tip. There are better places around."}
{"text":"We tried the Aburi Torched Sushi chef special tasting plate this evening. The seafood itself was great, and the condiments were an interesting and tasty match. However, the Kobe beef was a bit over torched, and the rice did not taste fresh. 

We also had the oyster tasting menu. No complaints about the fresh raw oysters. The oyster nigiri was decent, but again we had a problem with the texture and freshness of the rice. Maybe it's because we came an hour before closing...

In my opinion, the quality of food we had today wasn't worth the price, and this is due mainly to the rice. We were happy with the service."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 other Edo locations in mid-Toronto and am a fan of the menu. I was happy to find the same excellent food and standards at this new Edo location in the Hilton Markham. Bonuses: Parking is easy here and nice lunch menu choices. My favorites are on the menu too: hot eggplant appetizer, sushi pizzas, salad with the fantastic house dressing. 
There's a nice discount going on for eating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and a very reasonable price , the food is amazing and the customer service is very good , the food takes a bit of time to get ready but everything else is great"}
{"text":"In summary, way overpriced for mediocre food. 

Came here with a Groupon, which was meant to be a \"5 course tasting menu for 2\" with a regular price $128 (groupon was $72). 

There is a large parking lot for the hotel, but it was completely full, so we had to drive around for a while, which was a little annoying. But its free parking (although this is Markham so thats kind of expected). Enter the restaurant and the lady who greets us does not smile nor even really make eye contact... basically just asks to process the groupon. The restaurant itself is on the smaller size. Customers are very casually dressed. 

Seemed like almost all of the restaurant, if not all, were using the Groupon, as we were all getting the same food. From my experience, most restaurants don't count the amuse-bouche as one of the \"courses\", but this place does. 

The food was only okay:
-amuse-bouche (Seafood Sunomomo: Tiger shrimp, Hokkaido scallop, and kanikama on a bed of grass noodle and seaweed) was okay. Visually, this was probably the only thing that even came close to what I expect from a Tasting Menu (ie was at least somewhat creative) 
-appetizer (Chawan Mushi: Fresh Nova Scotia lobster and egg custard in a tarragon and black pepper lobster bisque) was actually pretty bad. The lobster piece was tiny, and pretty useless. In fact, when I saw & ate it, I had no idea what it was. It's only after when I looked at the menu again that I noticed it was lobster. The dish essentially tasted like egg
-sushi was okay... quite comparable to decent AYCE places. I'm a little suspicious of the quality of the fish given they covered each sushi roll with generous amounts of sauces 
-entree (cod) was the highlight... actually tasted nice, although the portions were very stingy 
-desert was also decent, but again stingy portions 

When I see the words \"Tasting menu\", I expect to see some creativity. But that was lacking from this meal. Unfortunately the unfriendly service just makes things worse. I would feel very ripped off if I paid the full price for this meal (and this would have been a 1 star review). Based on the groupon price, I'd give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I think I will give Edo another chance and modify this review, but tonight it was just Okay. 

We had:

Hamachi appatiser - 5/5 get this

Seaweed salad - 2/5 an assortment of seaweed, when I only really wanted one kind. The dressing was thick. A peanut, or sesame base. Not for me. I would have preferred a Japanese vinaigrette. 

Tuna sashimi - 5/5 really fresh and tasty

Spicy salmon roll - 3/5. I've had way better at other places. 

Black cod - 4/5 very tasty. I didn't love the truffled brown rice. i didn't care for the flavour combination.

Chocolate fondu - 1/5 - FON-DON'T! 

Cheese cake - 2/5 this was a bowl of creamy, cheesy custard. It was okay with the strawberries, but we were expecting cheesecake. If you order this, modify your expectations. 


The service was awful. Our server was slow. She didn't bring out side plates, or clear old plates at the appropriate times. Water glasses were left empty for half the meal. But I will mention there is a lot of construction on the block Edo is on, so perhaps they were understaffed tonight. 

As I said, I will probably return one day. I noticed how fresh everything was and want to try more dishes here."}
{"text":"Last time I got a chirashi lunch here. This time I got a chirashi dinner takeout, thinking it would be bigger and better. Boy was I wrong.

My complaint about the chirashi lunch last time was that it lacked variety, but was okay in size. This dinner was okay in variety, but severely lacking in size (plus no soup and salad, and they forgot my wasabi). As you can see from the picture, there was only one thin slice of each kind sashimi. Taro's fish, which is just down the street (3 min drive), does the chirashi bigger, fresher, and cheaper.

I actually felt ripped off (it's like \"I paid 19 for this? You gotta be kidding\"). Don't think I need to come back again.

Quality: 6/10, Value: 4.5/10, Service 8/10. Overall 5/10 (Not an average)

Update: Please check my Japango review for how a Chirashi should be. Japango's Chirashi ($21) more than doubles Edo's Chirashi in amount of fish, exceeds Edo's Chirashi in quality, and includes soup and salad. Everything about Japango's Chirashi puts Edo's junk to shame. Hunger is preferable to Edo's food."}
{"text":"We came here for their prix fixe menu (per Groupon), and were blown away. Note, you need to make a reservation to enjoy this menu, because they need to prepare for it!

Service was excellent. We enjoyed some Bloody Samurai's (similar to a Caesar but with a few changes), garnished with shrimp.

Now, on to the food.

As soon as we sat down, we were offered a few bites of a noodle/cabbage dish. I'm actually not sure what it was, but it was delicious and the perfect amount of tangy.

I thought this was our \"amuse bouche\", as promised by the menu, but then the actual amuse bouche came out and it was divine. Salmon sashimi (I'm sure there's an official name for this, but I don't remember it) mixed with a light sauce, garnished with a radish, and sitting atop a piece of seaweed. Lovely. Too bad my date ate his, otherwise I would have been happy as a clam eating both.

Next, we had the lobster bisque with an egg. Yes, an egg. It was amazing and just the perfect size to give us a taste without filling us up for the next course.

Then, the aburi sushi came out. We had a lovely selection of seared tuna, squid, salmon, scallop, and one or two more types of fish. Each piece had it's own seasoning (e.g. a dollop of something or other), which was a nice touch and helped bring out the flavour of the fish. There was no soya sauce, which I'm not used to, but it's not a big deal. To be honest, I wasn't wowed by this, as I regularly have aburi sushi and it seemed like it was supposed to be smokier. 

Finally, our kobe beef steaks, medium rare, came out. The rest of the menu is determined for you, but here we had a choice between the kobe beef or black cod. I'm sure the black cod was great, but I just had a craving for kobe beef. It exceeded my expectations, as it was served atop grilled asparagus and peppers, accompanied by a mushroom rice mountain seasoned with truffle salt. Yes, you could actually taste the truffle salt, and it was delicious.

The dessert wasn't very impressive compared to everything else. My date and I ordered one of each so we could share. He got the green tea affogato and didn't want to share (it was delicious). I believe it was ice cream covered in green tea sauce, with some cookies on the side. I got the chocolate fondue. The fondue wasn't warm, and I ate all of the fruit on my plate. I wish I got the affogato because it was really good."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Round Three: Gentleman's choice, and he did a good job!  We arrived with high expectations, especially my boyfriend since he lives in the area and has been wanting to try Edo for quite a while.  In the best possible way, this dining experience was reminiscent of an infomercial to me.  

Anyone who's tried to find something to watch between 2am and 9am on a weekend knows how infomercials work - it's never as simple as \"5 easy payments of $19.99 buys you this wonderful device!\"  They always knock off a payment, add a carrying case, double the quantity, offer their first born - to really convince you that it's a deal.  So as a lover of deals and, admittedly, an occasional victim of infomercials, how could I not be excited by a place that goes above and beyond the expected three courses for Summerlicious?  

Online, I had learned that there was a \"surprise complimentary amuse\" to start things off, and a sushi course offered with your choice of entree!  When we sat down, we were presented with a tiny dish (a little bigger than a toonie) with some julienned greens and glass noodles.  It had a mild flavour, but I enjoyed what I presumed was our amuse.  But wait, there's more!  Apparently the amuse was still to come, and this was just another extra that had been thrown in for good measure.  The actual amuse consisted of vegetables wrapped in rice paper with sauce.  It was very pretty, and was tasty too - although the first bite didn't have much sauce and as such not as much flavour as the second.  But, like the first dish, it was light and refreshing and a nice way to start the meal.

There's always one not-an-actor testing the product who gets really REALLY excited by it - this part was played by my boyfriend as he gulped down two Japanese Slipper martinis before I managed to finish my first.  I got the impression he liked it.  

I do have to mention the server we had.  She was amazing, and really embodied a TV presenter as she described each of our courses.  I loved the details she gave, including the chef's suggestions on how we should eat each item.  It elevated the meal to more than just dinner - it was an experience.  She described each of the 4 types of sushi the chef had created.  All delicious, a particular favourite was one with a small piece of cream cheese on top.  Each piece had individual sauces, and weren't served with soy sauce because \"they don't need it\", our server informed us.  She was right!  

The product salesperson and/or inventor always has to take some time to explain to you why it's so much better than the competition.  Through the grapevine, I've heard that the main chef's concept for the restaurant is to show that Japanese cuisine is more than just sushi, and as such there isn't a lot of it on the regular menu.

Perhaps to emphasize this point, our main courses consisted not only of the assorted sushi plates, but also of a separate entrÃ©e.  I selected the Wafu Umino-sachi Noodle - shrimps, scallops, and mushrooms with soy flavoured spaghettini.  The seafood, the server informed me, had been soaked in sake.  I could taste it, but it wasn't overpowering.  Again, the flavours were mild but worked well and I really enjoyed the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Kobe Beef Hamburger Steak.  It was the first time trying kobe beef for both of us - and WOW.  So flavourful, so juicy...just delicious.  I highly recommend it!  

As for desserts, I ordered the pear and he the chocolate fondue.  Both dishes came with a good amount of fresh fruit and were both very tasty and a nice lighter finish to the meal.  

Luckily, that's where the comparisons end; there was no mad grab for further sales when we finished our meals.  This is the way I believe a Summerlicious experience should be - professional, and really showing why we should come back to the restaurant for the regular menu.  An extra hat tip to this lovely experience - as we were leaving, the chef himself called after us to thank us for coming.  A very nice touch.

All in all, it was a fantastic meal with amazing service in a very nice setting."}
{"text":"If I could give negative star I would give them -5 star.  Our experience Today was terrible.

My GF and I went their with the $88 groupon deal for the Kobe Beef dinner. We originally bought it for the Markham Hilton Location, but that one closed down so they sent us to here.
We also upgraded $24 for the Aburi Sushi taster.  But the Sushi quality was under par and worst than AYCE. Ther Service was horrible and Slow.

The Aburi sushi was prepared and sitting at the counter and the Slow Blonde waitress was walking around doing random thing for a good 15-20 min and we had to remind her we order the Aburi Sushi Taster. By the time it arrived it was ice cold. and the favour sucked, They just took normal sushi and torched it.

Main Dish Kobe Beef. They just took a normal piece of steak and slapped it on the grill. It was decent for a steak but I wouldn't call Kobe Beef.

After we finish our Steak both our glasses was empty and she came clear away our dishes and silverware. She walked back and forth 4 times by our table and didn't ask to refill our water. We had to ask her.

Lastly what put the nail in the coffin is when we got our bill They slapped on an automatic 15% $20 tip. For that service I was diffinitly not going to left her a tip. I was soo pissed I just left the money on the table and left without complaining to the manager on duty.

I warn people stay away from this restaurant. Spend your money elseware like JaBistro or Guu."}
{"text":"Visited on Mon Oct 13 Thanksgiving for a tasting menu Japanese Tapas meets Spanish Wine. It was a special event with a a group called Spanish Wine Society. Reservations for 4 were easily made. Went with 3 friends Janet, Puiyan and Deanna. Parking in the area was a bit limited to pay-and-display along Eglinton. 

Atmosphere
The restaurant is split into two levels, we were at first seated on the bottom level with a normal table for 4. After 20 min the server moved us to the upper level. But the seating was awkward we were seating beside each other in a line, it really made it difficult to have a conversation. The server said this section was where guests were seated for the tasting menu. We didn't enjoy the setup of the tables, and there were 2 staff that were trying to get organized which took a while. We asked one server to get the tasting menu started, and 15 min later the 2nd server asks if we are ready to start they obviously didn't communicate. The volume of the restaurant was a average volume, but died down by 10pm. 

Wines
The Master of Oenology was Gonzalo Lainez, but he barely talked to us. We were given 3 glasses of wine: a Chardonnnay, a Rosado and a Madre Reserva a red. The glasses were only about 1/3 full and they didn't offer refills which seemed kind of cheap. We could see the bottles all opened at the table on the side, they should have offered refills. He made brief 30 second introductions about the wines, but seemed more interested in talking to the group to the left of us. The group to the left seemed to be personal friends, as near the end of our meal he took off his jacket and sat down with them. We asked Gonzalo if he had tasted the food, and stated that he hadn't. How can he talk about the wines if he hasn't eaten the food that it was paired with? 

Food
There was a small amuse-bouche consiting of room-temperature noodles which was nice and sweet. 

The 6 items came on two dishes, you can see photos that i've uploaded. It was difficult to keep track as on the menu they weren't listed the same way that they were served. All of the portions were very small, which is typical of tasting menues. The seared tuna was good. The unagi avocago temari was quite unique looking as it was a round-style sushi. The Kobe gyoza was disappointing as there was only 1 piece! The mini dynamite hand-roll was excellent and they use a different type of seaweed that isn't as chewy. The chicken breast was a bit tough in my opinion. There was what we assume were real gold flakes on the dishes.

The highlight of the evening was meeting the Corporate Executive Chef Ryo Ozawa who has been with Edo for 9 years. He has made appearances with Top Chef Canada and other cooking competitions. At least he explained that he tasted the food and the wine to ensure they were paired well. He talked to our group for a good 5 min and was much more interesting to talk to than the wine expert. He even gave his personal business card.  

For the price of $25 including tax and tip was a great price. But I was still hungry afterwards and got a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Visited Fri June 30 for dinner. Called to make reservations the day before. Very attentive service, this place is a perfect 5 star! 

Pros
The meal comes with an amouse bouche, don't drink the sauce it has a vinegar taste. 
Tempura moriawase came with 3 pieces of shrimp! As well as seaweed which I haven't seen before. 
Miso eggplant - The eggplant was very soft and tasty, a bit too much miso paste which overpowered the eggplant. 
Rainbow dragon maki -  Fresh and tasty, no complaints. 
White wind dragon - A specialty roll that is torched, a must-try. 
Lots of free parking available. 
You can order delivery from UberEats!

Cons
The server had a bit of a heavy Japanese accent making it difficult to understand at times. 
Edo doesn't have as much of a high-end feel since it's attached to Bayview Village and shoppers can see right into the restaurant. 

Protip - Sushi purists will say that sushi cannot be made with brown rice but my health is more important. Any roll can be made with brown rice for $1. I LOVE places that can make sushi with brown rice. 

Damage $52"}
{"text":"Unsure of what to say, not terrible, but the taro and beef tataki both had a bitter aftertaste. The quality is not up to par to the price, and overall letdown.

For $50+ per person, there are many other better places to go to.
Oh, the atmosphere was adequate, service was superb."}
{"text":"Have been here a million times and now, we live so close I can see it from the end of my driveway. Score.
Not the best sushi in the city (that award goes to Nami), but solid. Definitely toned down for the Forest Hill crowd (I can make that comment since I am one of them but not your typical).
Fish is sometimes questionable - I have had several very fishy pieces of tuna which is pretty gross if it has ever happened to you...you swallow it and think, 'umm, I might be getting sick from this later on'. Favorite thing of mine to order is the avocado salad - the ginger dressing is so legendary that they've started selling bottles of it, I could roll in the stuff.
Cooked food is great - if you like to go to sushi places and order chicken teriyaki, you're in luck..tempura is yummy too. 
Ebi almond is greasy and made me feel sick afterwards. Too many almonds.
Tuna tar-tower is spectacular. I was sad when it was over and even more sad that I had to share it.
Sweet potato tempura fries are really good.
All the rolls are good - this is one place that doesn't make spicy tuna by smashing up tuna and mixing it with tempura bits and mayonnaise. It has a chunk of tuna in the middle with tem-bits and mayo beside it. The more expensive way of making it, I'm assuming. Butterfish is a lot of peoples' favorite but I find it really soggy. 
Service ranges from slow to FOREVER. The owner cruises through every time I'm there so you'd think they'd get it together...
Rather expensive but not the most costly."}
{"text":"After my boyfriend and I sat down we got a tiny piece of spicy tofu, we like it,nits not that spicy and the sauce is pretty good.

Then we waited for 20mins ! To get to our salmon tataki, it is a good salad with also very tiny portion, 3 pics of salmon.. 

Then we wait for another 10 mins to get our sushi, it is very good and variety.

After the sushi, another 15 mins... My boyfriend and I were getting hangry already and finally here it comes the main course, Kobe Japan slider and Japanese style seafood pasta.

After my first bite of the Kobe slider I realized how silly am I to think the burger meat will be different! When Kobe beef become burger meat, there's nothing Kobe about it... Infact it makes my jaw hurts after I chewed all the meat... The sweet potato fries are just yam tempura that's been cut same as fries.
Inside the seafood spaghetti, there's one small scallop that's been cuffed into two pics, two shrimps and 3 slices of squid...I like the flavour although my BF doesn't.

At the end is the small portion normal dessert.

I can only say it's a dinner that just worth 35$, no more."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon (just as most of the other patrons in the restaurant did) and we had a good experience. We had arrived around 6pm and were the only ones for awhile, though I was glad that it began to fill up a little later on. The waiter (though quiet), was very attentive and explained every dish as it arrived. It's a modern, fancy restaurant inside of the Hilton hotel so there's definitely a classy aura around it. The food was also prepared expertly and was definitely at a superior level to the many other Japanese restaurants in the area. Good for a romantic evening. I believe they also do takeout, which is an interesting spin on fine dining."}
{"text":"Best sushi around town I refuse to eat sushi from any where else! Only down fall of being part of the mall it closes mall hours"}
{"text":"Don't know much about their regular menu. i've only been here once for winterlicious... not impressed and on the pricy end. Wait was very long for each dish, portions are so small, food was not unique. Did not have a good experience. will not come again."}
{"text":"We'd heard about Edo for years. Service was efficient and the food came quickly. But overall not very impressed. Reasonable price. Decor a bit tired."}
{"text":"I was able to try this place during Summerlicious, their Summerlicious menu really did caught my eyes, and I've been hearing good things about this place, so I decided to try this place.

The place is actually quite small, but it's very elegant.  Menu wise, for regular days, it's on the pricey end.  Due to the longer than usual wait at the front, when I was seated and ordered our food with my friend, the manager of the store gave us a special roll from the house.  I was actually very impress with the handroll given, it was smoked salmon but wrapped in rice paper, something I never had before.

Out of all the dishes, I really enjoyed their house special sushi platter.  The fish was very fresh and the chef added special sauce on each sushi to bring out the freshness of the fish.  The main course was very good too,  but having to eat the Beef Patty without actual buns did felt a bit weird.

Overall, I enjoyed my time at this place and I would recommend going here for Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Fast next to mcdonalds. Got the 3 piece veggie roll. Was ok. Good service; no line. Good for takeout. Tea was a bit pricey, ordinary lipton tea or cheaper type teabag for ~2$.  Not the freshest fish. Fast food where they strive to minimize costs to maintain profit. Frozen common fish like shrimp/artificial crab/reformed tuna.

They have veggie options"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to anything Japanese. I LOVE Sushi! I live in SF and there is no shortage of amazing sushi establishments. 

The hubby was a restaurant manager at Edo several years ago and has been talking about it for sometime. I don't doubt his sushi knowledge and trust that Edo would be just as fantastic. 

He DID NOT let me down. Edo is now my favorite sushi restaurant. Yes favorite! Not fav in Toronto - just Fav PERIOD.  

The sushi pizza was soo good! The fish fresh and the rice, just the right amount of crispy. 
Maple Tuna literally melts in your mouth
My all time fav dish is the Sea Treasures. Baked battered fish coated in Japanese mayo - doesn't sounds great BUT trust me it is!

I can't rave anymore about this place anymore..You must try it! I wish they'd open an Edo in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"This wasn't our original place where we wanted to eat, however where we were planning on going had a line up so we decided to get some sushi since we were starving.  This place looks really nice inside and can definitely accommodate large groups (one group had about 20 people for a bday celebration).  Lucky for us, even though a Saturday night we got a table for 2.

The menu and drink selection is pretty decent.  Had the Wild Elder drink (gi, elderflowers, etc) and at first it was really syrupy sweet tasting. We asked the server if we couldget it in a taller glass with club soda.  She was very accommodating and the drink tasted much better after she adjusted it for us.

We ordered a few things from the menu - organic miso soup, beef tataki (I don't think worth the $13 price), spicy tempura tuna (not bad), and another sushi dish with butterfish (which was quite nice).

Service was ok - our server was very nice and helpful when we asked for changes in the drink, but she forgot small things like bringing us water or soy sauce.   But everyone was pleasant and nice so perhaps she just had a long day.

I don't think I would specifically go back here, but if I were in the area I wouldn't mind giving a few other items on the menu a try.

Decent effort overall"}
{"text":"Food sucked and the service was slow, even though the restaurant was not busy. There are better options in the area. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always fantastic this location is. Friendly service and clean. Prices are great, portions are good. 
High chairs for families. Food is very fresh. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of hubs go to lunch spots, I like that they're Calgary based and during the holidays they have some great charity initiatives. They've also expanded their menu and the new chop chop bowls are a good quick lunch option. The staff here are always friendly and accommodating and the wait isn't to long."}
{"text":"Decent.   What do you expect from a place in the food court?  Ordered the chicken and beef combo that came with spring roll and drink.   Spring roll was soggy.   Food was ok. 

Only would come back if i was pressed for time and wanted something quick."}
{"text":"I just found out the location is closed! Their website didn't mention it is closed. I called ahead for reservation at the Markham location and my call was answered. Now that I think back my call must have been directed to the Eglinton location without knowing it. I only knew it was closed when I actually arrived at Hilton Suites in Markham on the day of my reservation and noticed the door closed with a sign at the front. I received a groupon voucher for Edo Markham as a gift and it cannot be redeemed now. They should have mentioned the closure on their website or the person answering the call at the Edo Markham Hilton Suites number should have mentioned it. It is such a mismanaged restaurant. What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious 2012, and can't say that I am impressed.  Actually I am slightly embarrassed that I picked this restaurants for my girlfriends on our night out.  We did a pretty late booking for Winterlicious but I went on Open Table and picked this one because it was available on a Friday evening and had good ratings.  I'm glad I booked because there were a few people waiting for seats at the door when we got there.

The Winterlicious meal included appetizer, sushi, main and dessert.  The portions were dainty, even for us girls who usually eat like birds and can never finish anything.  We ordered an extra sushi roll to share.  The food came out so slow, I think we must have waited 20 minutes before our salads came out.  The martini that my friends ordered tasted like soho and cranberry, for $6 a pop, that was a bit pricey for something that was so simple.

I think the most disappointing part of the experience was that the waitress kept pressing us to order her favourite picks.  She practically made my friend switch her vegetarian salad pick to the tuna salad and didn't mention to my friend who is already putt off by fish that the tuna is cooked very rare.  Then when my friend said she didn't enjoy it, she egged my friend to eat it and then made her feel bad that she barely touched it.  

The taste of the food was interesting, creative, pretty but it didn't taste very good.  The sushi that was included had some kind of mint leaves in it which was weird.  The chicken/kobe beef dish wasn't good for my friend either.  The salmon dish that was part of Winterlicious was completely deep fried and the \"tartar sauce\" was just chopped up eggs and mayonnaise - gross.  There was just too many things thrown into that dish, the tartar sauce, balsalmic reduction, tomato salsa, yuzu sauce, and another green sauce.  It didn't come together at all.  The only thing that was good was the sushi pizza and the dynamite roll.  The dynamite roll wasn't part of the Winterlicious menu.

I also have to mention that their soy puff pastry tastes like the puff pastry that I can get from Costco.  Not bad but I can buy a few tubs of these for the same price that I paid for this meal."}
{"text":"The food is the same at just about every Edo so no need to go into that.  The service at this location is excellent.  They get you your order quickly as well."}
{"text":"By far the best Sushi in Markham. We frequent Main Sushi but tried this on Mother's Day. The selection was different and classic. The flavours amazing and the sushi was incredibly fresh - and it was a sunday :) LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Food is very good, especially the sweet potato tempura!!!! Service is great. Very expensive."}
{"text":"There are many restaurants along this strip of Eglinton, some of which attract a fair bit of buzz from the Forest Hill crowd, before settling into mid-town mediocrity. 

Located down the street from Ave/Eg anchor Yitz's Delicatessen, Edo provides a convenient answer to those who feel more like raw fish than cured meat. 

At one point, they pretty much had the strip to themselves. Now, sushi joints dot the landscape, in varying degrees of authenticity. I doubt anyone would accuse Edo of being overly authentic, but if you're willing to shell out, you will receive a perfectly decent meal. 

In light of the clientele and toned-down offerings, I humbly suggest that we coin a new term for this kind of cuisine-\"Jewpanese\"-ethnic food that you can bring your squeamish grandparents to enjoy. 

Viewed through this lens, dinner at Edo is a success. Miso soup packs deep flavour into warming broth studded with tofu and wakame. Wait staff don't bat an eye when superannuated diners request spoons. 

Gyoza-made with veal, not pork-are tender pasta pockets with a light crispness, surrounding delicate meat. 

Tempura anything is properly crisp, although the Shiso leaves always have gloopy cold spots. They're best avoided in favour of the sweet potato and zucchini. My only regret about the shrimp is that there aren't more. 

Bento boxes offer the usual suspects. Rice is texturally perfect; stir-fried vegetables occasionally overdone; teriyaki is predictably sweet and dry-just as your grandparents like it. 

Sushi is well-executed but unadventurous. Cream cheese appears often in rolls, along with crispy tempura bits. The fish itself is reliably fresh, though. A pick-and-mix selection makes for a fun and collaborative meal. 

This is the rare case where I deduct points for atmosphere. The room is cold and grey; the chair are hard metal, set at odd angles. Service discourages lingering. A model of efficiency, perhaps, but an underwhelming dining experience."}
{"text":"TL;DR (points 1-4 are explained below) I even made a Yelp account to make this review.
1. Server gave me attitude when I asked where my food was after 40 minutes
2. Sashimi/sushi wasn't the best, everything lacked variety 
3. Green tea actually costed money (like a 3-4 dollars/each) in a Japanese restaurant. Lol. 
4. They make the machines automatic tip to be 18%, 25%, other. Some older folks have no idea how to use the credit card machines and set it to another %age. The audacity to even go to 18% when their food and service is shit amazes me. 

__________________________________________________________________________________
This is the most ridiculous place I've ever been to. You'd think that in a high end shopping mall, they would have good service. This is the second time I've come here, and they absolutely did not redeem themselves whatsoever. Second time is going to be described here: 

1. The server was atrocious. She's this middle-aged lady with short hair and clips on her fringe (not hating on short hair and clips, just trying to describe her so that you can identify her in the future). We waited 40 minutes for 3 orders (2 chirashi + 1 ginzo?ginko?) because the people beside us ordered a lot. Here was the dialogue: 

Me: *No attitude, I even smiled*  Excuse me miss, I was just wondering where our order is. We waited for a while now and just wanted to know what's the status. 

Her: *Frowned + lots of attitude* So just wait 10 more minutes. They have a big order and you can wait. 

Me: Okay. Thanks.

Excuse me what? If within the 40 minutes, someone had walked up to me and said \"Hey guys, sorry for the wait! The other table has a big order and yours will be coming in the next 20 minutes.\" I'd have nothing to say. Reasonable. But this lady gave me attitude for asking where my food was and it left me fuming. I was bringing my parents out for a nice dinner and the mood was totally ruined. 

Also, this is a personal thought (+ I have never worked in the food industry so I have no idea if this thought is reasonable or not), if the other table has 10 orders and we had 3, isn't it possible to give them a few orders first (3-5), work on ours while they eat, serve us ours and then work on theirs? Whatever, I wouldn't know. All my knowledge about serving is from Flo's diner and some other apps. 

2. The food was underwhelming. The chirashi was actually just 3/5 rice, 1/5 vegetables, 1/5 actual sashimi. There was so much rice that even if I ordered another side of sashimi, I'd still have rice left over. There were 2 avocados, 2 cucumbers, a whole bunch of tasteless white shredded carrots, leaves and a daffodil. Then for the sashimi, it was just chewy octopus (bad), one salmon, eel (unagi), 2 other sashimi I don't recall and 2 eggs (tamago). It looks good trust me, but it tasted unsatisfying. Plus it wasn't sashimi soy sauce lol. So that means that the soy sauce is super salty just like me. 

3. Why would you charge for green tea?? I don't understand. I go to these quaint little Japanese restaurants and they give green tea for free. I don't remember how much it was ($3.99 or less??) but still! I don't remember because one of the girls actually saw how poor the server's manners was and quickly came over to say that the tea was on the house. So that's why there's one star. If not, I would've found a way to code into the Yelp system a 0/5 star. 

4. The tip machine % option makes it so that you give 18%/25%/other. I'm sure some older/not tech-savvy folks have fallen for this because they don't know how to change the options. This is fricken ridiculous. 18%??? Are you FRIED. They have the audacity to charge this much tip with these servers + food quality? Hell no. 


Thanks for listening, don't go to this place - you'd be better off to go to Loblaws and go get a green dragon roll for $8.99. 

*Also side note, at Donburi, a big bowl of salad, green tea, and miso soup are complementary. Everything here was tiny - small ass cube (literally a cube bowl), with 1 inch deep of soup + 2 strands of noodles - i shit you not. Then miso soup was $4 and green tea was $3 or something."}
{"text":"3rd visit to this reastaurant, first one not on a weekend. I have to admit it was disappointing. Reserved at 7.45, arrived at 7.45, waited 10 minutes for seating - table was Empty. the waitress kept telling me \"Ill be right there\". i waited until 8.25 to order an appetizer of black cod plus two rolls. Took 30 minutes to order.
 Food came after 30 min, first the roll, and last, of course, the appetizer. 
Left 1$ tip. 
The food is great, the atmosphere good (except some big screaming parties with tons of kids), but the service received was really, really bad.

I will come back, during weekend this time. Looks like the management cuts on employees during the week."}
{"text":"The food here is on par with any other location but the service is always slow. Its like they think that because they're a contained restaurant that people don't expect that quick speed of service that you've come to know and love at the mall food court locations.

Pick up the pace people!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here while on a business trip to Toronto and stayed at the Hilton. Service was really good. I started with Miso Soup and then progressed to spicy tuna \"pizza\", Unagi (freshwater eel) nigiri, and finally the Dragon Roll with butter fish. Fish was very fresh and flavorful. My only comment is that virtually none of the dishes had any spice--including the spicy tuna! Even the wasabi had virtually no burn to it. I added so much wasabi to the soy sauce that it took on the consistency of chalk and still nothing. Very odd. 

The sushi pizza is a neat idea; basically a round rice \"platform\" underneath the fish, cut into slices just like a pizza. 

My only other beef is the price, but I must say I expected that based on the fact that this Edo is in a hotel, and food in Toronto is fairly pricey anyway."}
{"text":"The whole experience was very pleasant. The chef's selection was magnificent in every sense. Tiny portions of meticulously crafted gastronomics tease your palate and leave you wanting more. The downside is that all other sushi restaurants lost something today. No one lives up to this! Highly recommended food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We go here for our son. He loves their Age-dashi tofu and the avocado rolls. 

Their service is efficient and they also have a good bar with wines, and single malts along with sake."}
