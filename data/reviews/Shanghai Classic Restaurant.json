{"text":"Always a family favorite.  We go here every couple months.  Best sizzling rice with shrimp and tomato ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Chinese food. The ginger beef definitely has a richer flavour than any other Chinese place in town. It's worth going for that alone. Aside from that everything else seems like an average Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Another place that will serve you up a \"Gweilo-Special\" - Ginger Beef, Chicken Fried Rice, Spring Rolls, and Chow Mein"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Chinese restaurant in town - lunch or dinner. It's a small restaurant so reservations are recommended, but they also do takeout if you are unable to grab a table.  This restaurant has some of the most friendly wait staff ever. They are often super busy but still attentive and personable.   The food is delicious, the portions are big and really reasonably priced. Some of our usual dishes that just don't taste as great anywhere else:  Duck 4 courses - variations of this exist, and all of them are delicious. The Peking duck is by far the best in the city! The duck fried rice is also delicious.  Salt and pepper squid / seafood.  Sizzling rice.  Dumplings Beef flat rice noodles (we only order this in Chinese so I can't recall the exact English translation).   Try it! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"At 630pm I ordered sliced chicken & veggies, pork & sweet/sour & steamed rice. They said delivery in 40min but it arrived in 20! Food was HOT and Very Good! Was it fluke everything was so awesome at peek business time??"}
{"text":"I have eaten here again, this time take out, and the dumplings and rice have the same rating, but the ginger beef was amazing, and the mix veggies were hot and fresh.  Its been a couple of hours since I have eaten, and I am still not hungry."}
{"text":"There are not many good chinese restaurants in calgary. Shanghai classic is one of the few acceptable ones. The prices are fair and the food is decent. They have a wide selection of fried noodles and rice for lunch, a large selection of dishes for dinner and even a small selection of late night eats. I recommend their Peking duck for dinner which is what we usually go for. The service is not great which is not out of the ordinary for a chinese restaurant. I have noticed they have quite a few regulars that dine there and they seem to get better service."}
{"text":"Gone down hill. Ordered Cantonese chow mein for take out. The contents were the most laughable. Few mini shrimps and negligible amount of.pork."}
{"text":"Good but not great could be better in renovations and presentation but best jelly fish in calgary and awesome  staff. Pretty good"}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually not bad... It actually has quite a bit of Chinese patrons.  The food is good as well as long as you do not order the 'gwei-lo specials'. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I dined at Shanghai Classic, it was one of my favourites when they were located in the strip mall at Northmount and 4th. I was glad to discover that they had not disappeared from the Calgary food scene. It is one of the better restaurants to be found in a residential area. Last night we had the Ginger Beef but unfortunately the Ginger Beef good have been better. The beef was cooked to perfection. The beef was tender on the inside with just the right amount of crunch to the batter. The sauce was too heavy on the soya and we could hardly taste the nuances of ginger in the sauce. The other dish we had was Snow Pea leaves in Garlic Sauce (off menu item) or in Cantonese Tau Miew.  This is one of my favourite vegetable dishes and I must say it was cooked to perfection, the sauce was just garlicky enough to complement the snow pea leaves. The snow pea leaves were tender, the stems were cooked just enough to maintain the slight crispness expected in a stir fry. Service was good. Two dishes and steamed rice cost $30 before tip."}
{"text":"The boys and I were here with some friends at lunchtime.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  Our son ordered steamed layered white rolls (un see geun) with a side of condensed milk and it was wonderfully soft and delicious.  We also ordered three types of noodles for lunch: egg noodles with beef slices and baby bok choy; flat rice noodles (hor fun) with shrimp, Chinese mushrooms, squid, char siu, sliced chicken, baby bok choy; rice vermicelli with char siu, onions, a few bean sprouts, and shrimp.   Overall, we had a pretty good lunch; the flavours were fairly average, though (bland to mildly salty).  The kitchen should've thought to change up the veggies a bit.  Two dishes had no other vegetable in it except for baby bok choy.  Well, at least the hor fun had a few Chinese mushrooms in it..."}
{"text":"I ordered a deep fried squid. The menu is for $8.95, and that is the only menu I got. When I got the bill, they were charging me $12.95. They told me that is a larger size, which I saw it nowhere on the menu and they didn't tell us when they took my order. Very dishonest restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family likes to enjoy lunch or early supper at this restaurant in Beddington.  We have gone to this place often and lots of Chinese people eat here. That's a good sign since they are picky about Chinese food.  My little niece loves the ying yang rice.it comes half with a white creamy rice chicken side and the other half a shrimp tomato rice side.  We enjoy this a lot.  We always get the beef rice noodle dish . It has stir fried tender beef slices with flat rice noodles & sprouts .  It was my moms favourite too!  Their large congee we get is a huge bowl and we often take leftovers home.  We like the congee with tender bass fish fillets and the Chinese egg mixed in.   The Chicken chow mein is delicious with the crispy noodles and especially when tossed with the gravy !  My favourite which I get every time is those large chicken wings!  Large and lightly battered and served with lemon wedges.  You squeeze a drizzle of lemon all over them and they are the best ever!  Sometimes my husband order the Sizzling tomato shrimp rice dish.  His favourite and it sizzles and crackles when they pour the sauce over the crispy hot rice!  This is a popular place in the strip mall beside the Beddington coop.  Go try it - good food and often very busy!"}
