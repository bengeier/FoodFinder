{"text":"I order almost the same thing as always. Once I ordered \"zi ran yang rou\"-- a lamb dish to go, I don't know what the English name for it. It looked kinda different that day, but still the same smell/flavor, so we ate anyways. After we ate, we felt so weak and had no energy, so basically lie in bed all afternoon, my mom felt bad, but I was worse and threw up so many hours after laying in the bed, I threw up and I felt relived! I never experienced anything like that in my life! We never went back again. I guess the lamb went bad but they still went ahead and served it. I used to had no concept of suing or complaining it to the health department, I don't know what could happen if I did."}

I was so sad when Dong Ting Spring sold to another owner and the food was totally different. I am excited to have access to that great Hunan Food once again. Enjoy the fish, kidney, and almost any chicken dish. Very good!"}
