{"text":"Went to Hashi Sushi yesterday (Mothers Day, May 14, 2017) with family and friends. The reason we chose this restaurant was from the positive Yelp reviews, my wife loves ramen, whereas I like sushi. We both get to order what we want. 

Wifey had: R1 Tonkotsu Ramen ($14). We were expecting the gooey yolk egg that comes with traditional Japanese ramen, but what we we served were fried egg strips. The ramen was pretty bad. Lol. When wifey comments that \"it's ok\" she's being polite. And other signs: she struggles to finish even half of the dish and leaves the meat from the ramen. I tried it and agree that it's not good at all. In all fairness, we are comparing this ramen to the likes of Ramen Isshin, Sansotei, and we recently came back from Tokyo, Japan. The broth lacked flavour, the egg was not the gooey yolk, the pork wasn't good. I told my wifey I owed her another ramen dinner :) Maybe it's because the owners are Korean and this is a Korean version of ramen?; 2/5

I had the Dinner version of the Beef Teriyaki and Sashimi Bento ($19). The included salad was good and so was the dressing. I found some bad greens in the salad -yellow. Yes throw these out! Sashimi, tempura, miso soup, and beef teriyaki were all good. The edamame was very salty and unedible; 3/5

This restaurant is quite small. Yet, service was very slow. Based on the number of tables, it could accommodate approximately 16-20 people. While we were there, 2 groups of customers (both were a party of 4) were turned away. The lady asked if they had reservations. Both didn't. She told them she already had reservations and she didn't have a table for them. I shook my head at the way they conducted business. My friends and I were there for about 1.5-2 hours and she left an empty table for a reservation instead of serving those customers. By the time we left the restaurant, the 4-seat table was still left unoccupied. Anyway, that's their decision lol. 

We will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service was terrific. We had everything from Gioza and sushi for appetizers, and Ramen for our meal. Really delicious. Portions large and bursting with flavor. Prices were very reasonable. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"I tried the spicy Sashimi Salad with Oshinko roll and the taste was great. The salad was just mild spicy which was the right kind of spicy for my taste. One of the ways I judge a sushi placw is by their wasabi and this placed passed the wasabi quality test! I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"What a nice change from the cookie cutter sub-par sushi restaurants that are everywhere.  The food was great, the portion sizes generous and the plating was esthetically pleasing.  Prices are also very reasonable.  Would recommend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hashi sushi is Korean owned, the menu offers Korean and sushi.  It is one of the newer restaurants on the bayview street strip between Eglinton and Davisville. 

A nice small patio off bayview looked welcoming so we decided to try it out. 

We were greeted by a very polite server. She welcomed us and gave us the choice of seat. Of course we chose the outside. 

To start the server gave us ice water infused with a hint of lemon. Very nice touch.  Also seeing our son, she said she has a little one at home about the same age. She offered him a starter chopstick to try to eat with. So nice!

The a la carte menu seemed par for the course with respect to offering and pricing.  Will try that another day. 

We ordered the Bento and the sushi combo. Both were well portioned and Delicious.  The sashimi was very fresh and the spicy tuna was just right, not too spicy.  The Bento came with sashimi and tempura. The tempura was perfect crispy. 

I was tempted to order the bim bim bop, next time...

Overall Hashi Sushi is an above average Korean sushi restaurant.  I am happy to have found it among a sea of Chinese raw fish restaurants on this strip."}
{"text":"I'm always looking to support family-run businesses!  Good, hard-working people here!

The rolls and sashimi were fresh tasting and well made, Korean style of course.  We tried several different kinds from a couple of platters and also ordered some a la carte options. I particularly enjoyed the red roe (most places use orange).  The hamachi was my favourite fish of the evening. 

If I lived in the area, I would definitely come back!  They don't have fancy decor, nor are they ayce (like the other restaurants in the area).  

I would highly recommend this place if you're nearby.  It would be a great choice for take-out too!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, but they are a great new option in the area. We had a couple rolls, can't remember which. But I really loved the gyoza and veggie tempura :)"}
{"text":"my favorite place in the neighborhood.rolls are  fresh, reasonable price and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi restaurant around the neighbourhood. It's run by Koreans so you also have the option of ordering some Korean food if you like."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi at a fair price.  Portions are large and filling.  The only thing that can improve is the tea, which is a bit bland.  Otherwise great place, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered a Sashimi, Sushi and Maki set takeout for new year's eve party. They were all fresh and tasted great. Perfect amounts of rice for each sushi and Maki! Everyone at the party enjoyed all different types of fish. I will definitely try to dine in next time."}
{"text":"I live around the area and this place has always been my go to place to eat. This place never disappoints! Everything is clean and tastes delicious. The food is prepared with a lot of care.. And the service is great. I usually order the bulgogi bento box and the deep fried dumplings are to die for. The sushi is great! I hope this place remains in business for a long time.  A highly recommended place for those who are local in the area."}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi place in Toronto.  So much better than excess amount of mediocre AYCE sushi places around.

Both times we've gone we ordered the sushi platters and everything was super fresh and tasted great.  The rice is seasoned very well and there is the perfect amount... nothing worse than sushi with too much stodgy rice.  The presentation was also on point.

The restaurant is super clean and the owners are very friendly.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We decided to order this as reviews were quite good therefore took a chance.  Ordered Party Platter A, Edaname and Beef Bulgogi and they said would be delivered in 40 minutes.  Over an hour later, the driver finally came (she said she took a taxi to deliver it) and adviced me the Bulgogi not there as not available.  That was pretty disappointing as I would have expected a phone call to advise as I would have retracted my order.  When we finally got to eating our dinner, the rolls were fresh however rice was not sticky but falling apart, edamame was pretty bland, all in all a poor experience.  I'm happy we gave it a try and maybe their in dining is better than delivery."}
