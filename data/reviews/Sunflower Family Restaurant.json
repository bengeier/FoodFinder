{"text":"Small place open until 2 pm. they serve breakfast and lunch. grits was creamy with lots of butter delish.  hubby had pancakes with hashbrowns.  good portions with good prices.  Looks like alot of locals go there.  Service is very friendly.Will try the lunch next time."}
{"text":"Popular and busy local diner outside of Charlotte.   Large lunch menu consisted of classic American dishes with southern treats.   Hamburger steak, hot cakes, collard greens, fried okra and veggie beef soup were all delicious with satisfying portions and reasonable prices.  Friendly, efficient service. Worth visiting if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's kind of small and they are always busy. The owner comes around to ensure everyone is taken care of. Although it's busy, your food comes out promptly. I've never had an issue with my order. You get so much food for a decent price. I'm just sad that they are closed on Sunday's now. Very friendly staff with a down home atmosphere. I'm a Charlotte native and haven't found a place that has it all ( friendly staff, quick service, great atmosphere, and a concerned owner who values each customer). They are unmatched. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in middle of a busy street. Must try. We will have to go back for there fish it looked amazing. We went for breakfast and regret not ordering the fish."}
{"text":"So we have been here 3 times, so i can give a fair review. Love it. Its a mom and pop style diner. The food is excelent and the staff was great. I only have one complaint. The hot sauce.. lol i hate texas pete so ill have to bring my own lol. Other then that outstanding. Ill post pics of the food next week. This will be out new once a week ."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was plentiful and really really good!! Oh man that breakfast was perfect. I tried this time the Spanish Omelette with the sauce on top. Yummy!! Prices are also right in."}
{"text":"We use to really like this place. But the overly salty food has us both dizzy after we leave. To me they really used too much sodium. One time the soup wasn't good and we complained to have it changed and then the owner came out to tell us it tasted fine to him. After that experience that had been our last time there. The staff is always been friendly and there's usually never a wait for food but after the few times I've having bad experiences we have decided to find closer and better establishments."}
{"text":"I was told about this place from a friend and decided to give it a try. I was impressed with the food, customer service and atmosphere at this location.  Since that time I have returned with others and they were also impressed with   the overall visit. Needess to say I will be returning and it will be today."}
{"text":"Great food and service and the decor reminds me of the beach. This is the only breakfast place in the area though and fairly small, so you'll probably have a wait depending on what time you arrive."}
{"text":"Great food. Jamie was a sweet and attentive waitress. Kind of noisy but not excessive."}
{"text":"I just love this resturant. I have been going here for years. It doesn't matter how long I stay away, the owner knows my voice on my over the phone orders. I place a lot of phone orders. When i walk into the resturant, i am greeted by the waitresses and they are so polite and nice. They seat me and my party down if I am eating in and if I have a call in order they assist me almost immediately. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The breakfast is awesome and under $10 four 2 meals, you can't beat that. Over the past four years I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. It is by far the best breakfast spot ever!!!!!!!!

Once I had to go into the restaurant and wait on 2 other people to come and the waitresses we're very polite. They did not rush me and they did not rush us to finish eating once my party did arrived."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch breakfast lunch Place in Charlotte North Carolina do not sleep on this place the service is excellent the food is excellent fresh grape portion size delicious whenever I visit Charlotte this is my number one stop in when I get there and when I leave I love that place if they had a t-shirt for restaurants I will wear their t-shirt proudly"}
{"text":"Sunflower is the BEST homestyle breakfast/lunch place in Charlotte NC! My husband and I frequent this place often. I love bringing friends there for the first time, they are ALWAYS pleasantly suprised! A few weeks ago, I came with a group of 16, anyone who has been to Sunflower knows that isn't the place to bring a big group and expect to sit together. That Saturday morning, the staff was beyond accommodating! We were able to sit together as a group and our food was brought out as fast as it is when I am in a party of 2. All 16 of our orders were correct. I expected nothing less. Thank you Sunflower for being amazing as always!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite place for breakfast. Alas they will not be open on  Sundays anymore. MY CHILDREN WILL  Either be eating Cheerios or nothing. This is my go to spot when I don't want to cook a Sunday Breakfast.  Whoa is me. John (LOVE YOU)  Can we add home fries to the menu? Just asking. Sunflower is like my home away from home on afternoons I am home alone and haven't eaten. The apple topped pancake will cuddle you right up. I am getting the spinach feta today. If you wants some. Get in your buggy and go go go gadget!!!"}
{"text":"The Greek omelette was the best I have ever had!!!  Even better than that was the genuinely warm and friendly mood of the place. Felt like I was having breakfast at my Grandmother's!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! Typical diner feel and food. The pancakes are gynormous! We shared one, and had to take the other home. I ordered the turkey sausage and cheese omelette, it was just ok. The fried apple sticks are like a not-so-guilty pleasure in the middle of breakfast. I'd order those as a dessert. The grits didn't need any extra salt or pepper. And the rye toast was really good too.

We shall return."}
{"text":"This restaurant may look rough from the outside, but it has a cozy inside. The service was terrific and the food was served in nice portions. The food tasted great and I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We stopped here to try something different and our expectations were exceeded.  The service was great and the food was delicious.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"You will not find better home cooking anywhere in town and it's a bargain too. Fast service, kind staff and good food it's a shame they aren't open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Philly Cheesesteak to die for! I was pleasantly surprised at both the service and food quality. Looks like it's a place the locals gather. I hope to be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to judge on my first trip but my husband and I were not impressed. I ordered biscuits and gravy w/bacon and eggs, my husband ordered a rib eye w/grits and eggs. My biscuits were burnt and hard. The gravy was not sausage gravy but had a few crumbled pieces of sausage on top. My husband's \"rib eye\" was a slim fatty piece of meat that was even saved by Hentz 57 sauce. The atmosphere is great and the staff was great. They knew guests names when they walked in the door. We'll give it another try another day."}
{"text":"If you love Southern style food Sunflower Family Restaurant is a must try! If this is your first time visiting, trust me you will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food, great biscuits, huge portions, good service. Service was rendered at a reasonable speed for the crowd. The biscuits were light and fluffy I truly enjoyed mine."}
{"text":"I'm giving them five stars, not because it's the best food I've ever had.. it's because it's genuinely just /good/ food and they deserve it. A from your mama or grandmama's kitchen kind of good. It's absolutely reliable. I would know... I go to this place minimum once a week and feel negligent for not haven written them a good review sooner.  Everything I've gotten has been great. You're going to want to try those fried pork chops. The salads are big enough that it's a challenge to finish it. The soups ALWAYS taste home made, not just some junk out of a can. This place will give you the warm fuzzies of a home cooked meal. The service is always great. There's this beautiful little greek lady running the front end of the place that always remembers our names and our common orders. These people deserve your business for lunch/breakfast. 

You won't be disappointed. It gets packed though around noon, (because it's so good, obviously) but the waitresses and cooks get people in and out quickly. Comfort food at its best. Healthy options, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why people are giving this place all these excellent ratings. When you cook well this place is an turnoff. The city rated it a 95.5 and that is deceiving.  Pro: Kitchen from the view of the back door on the side seemed to be very clean. Large portions.

Cons:  Food is not good. It you like bland and unseasoned food this is your spot. They charge you for everything.  Parking is barely any.  Bathrooms are small. 

Suggestions:  Change cooks.  Change locations or at least buy some more space for parking.  By all means get some tables that match the width and length of the patrons."}
{"text":"GRITS GRITS GRITS! The most amazing Grits I've ever had! Usually you have to modify your grits by adding butter and sugar and more butter and sugar, BUT I can tell you that you will not have any issues enjoying these grits. 

 The diner is small, clean and very friendly as everyone seems to know each other by first name. A very refreshing sight to see! All the servers are great and very attentive and the breakfast was perfect! I can only imagine how good their lunch is. I will definitely make sure I come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is simple and soooooo good. Stopped for breakfast, got a special of sausage patties, scrambled eggs, cheese grits and hashbrowns.  Tasty! Everything looked so good that I forgot to take a pic and dug right in!!! The portions were generous and the staff was friendly.  They even had a fish variety available for breakfast.  Crab cakes, croaker, perch etc. I'll be getting that next time.  I noticed there were 2 other tables with first timers like myself enjoying their food while declaring the place their \"new\" spot.  All I could do was chew and nod in agreement."}
{"text":"Solid Grady spoon establishment.  Quick service, wide selection, and the food tastes good.  Be sure to slow down on Statesville road.  You very well might drive right past this place if your not careful."}
{"text":"Very good southern fare. Definitely worth a try. The chicken fried steak was excellent."}
{"text":"So yummy and kind service. Take your appetites though. Huge servings. Thank you for awesome food!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant located in a trailer, no worries there since they can actually seat 4 at a time at a table or booth.  The food is delish and you get quite a bit for your $$$.  An order of fish and grits includes 2 pieces of fried fish, grits 2 eggs and toast for roughly $7.99!  oh  yeahhhhh"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago and I was impressed with the service and the food. I will be going back again and telling my friends about this hidden gem!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for about 8 years and have passed this place hundreds of times.  One day my husband decided to surprise me with breakfast and I had no idea it was from here.  Boy, we have been missing out!!!  I've always seen this place packed each time I have driven past it and always thought to myself that I'll go there one day.  The grits, egg whites, and turkey sausage are my favorite items from here as well as the fried apple sticks.  I prefer cooking my own grits as usually when I order them in a restaurant, I have to doctor them up.  Well... that's not the case with the grits from here!  I did not have to add anything to these grits, which is an A++ in my book (lol).  

My husband and I are hooked and are fans of this place.  We have yet to try the other dishes, but we're completely sold on the breakfast.  The prices are very reasonable and the food portions are great, so you do get your money's worth (I can only speak for breakfast, that is).  We usually call ahead and place our order and it's always piping hot when we pick it up.  I have a list of favorite breakfast spots here in Charlotte, but this one is definitely in my top 3!!!"}
{"text":"Southern food at its finest. It's a meat plus three type restaurant that will leave you feeling full and uncomfortable the rest of the day from all the food you try to finish. I got the Bologna burger with chili and subbed the fries and slaw for mashed potatoes and gravy and fried okra for an extra $1. Also had the vegetable soup. I ate about half and felt really full. Leftovers the next day tasted even better. This place is very affordable. You could definitely split an entree here for the amount of food you get. In and out in under in hour during lunch."}
{"text":"Home style breakfast food with great service. It's not spectacular but will leave you feeling good and the staff are excellent. The grits really make it. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Unassuming little place, not much parking up front but there's room out back. Came in for breakfast around 6:00am and found the place well lit and cheerful (but not too cheerful) and with a little effort we mananged a table for six. Fresh black coffee was quick to the table and kept hot and filled throught breakfast. Special was Eggs and Grits and biscuit with choice of bacon, sausage, livermush, or Spam so I went  with the Spam.
A hot plate full of food arrived shortly: I generally prefer my spam medium-well with some crispied outside and hot inside but didn't think to ask (didnt think I had to, but it's the south...) Eggs up are easy wreck but these were delish: set whites with warm, soft, runny, yolks just begging for hot sauce and crumbled biscuit bits. Firm, creamy grits covered half my plate and didn't need any help, no salt, no pepper, no butter, just a fork. Fresh hot moist biscuits..."}
{"text":"Love the diner feel here! Definitely a mom and pop joint that should be around forever. Seating was quick even during rush hour lunch. Service was impeccable, constantly asking if we need anything and re-filling our water. Staff here work really hard churning tables to get customers seated right away.

I ordered the bologna burger w fries and had my co worker's chicken soup. The soup was so hearty! Def worth getting. And the bologna was the thickest I've ever seen. Best part about the burger is they added chili and fried pickles! Really juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant right off Statesville road, next to a gas station doesn't look like much, but wow is it amazing. Food is reasonably priced, portions are large, and the staff is amazing. One of my new favorite restaurants. You better come hungry though. They serve breakfast all day (which is amazing) and have great specials throughout the week. They've been open for 13 years according to one of the workers (may have been manager or owner), and I believe they'll be open for a lot longer if they keep up what they're doing."}
{"text":"The food is really good, however on several occasions I have witnessed waitresses handle money, use markers, and then proceed to toss bread or biscuits in your to go container with there bare hands. They don't wash their hands or put gloves on. I witnessed the cook this morning rub food on his shirt, touch his hair and did not wash his hands, he had no gloves on to change. Although I love the food, this will be my last time coming. The thought of getting sick scares me. Owner are wonderful people and very friendly, I hope they will talk to their employees and reiterate the importance of cleanliness when dealing with food that's being sold to their customers of many years."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and I love the owners and staff! Whenever we go in they know us and always make us feel very welcomed!"}
{"text":"In town visiting a good friend,who suggested havin breakfast here. Wow nice breakfast options. 
   I ordered Salmon Cakes (Delicious)with scrambled eggs & hash browns w/ two biscuit. That was one good damn breastfast. They give you a pretty good size portion of food for $10"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great! The crowd kept coming and the food kept flowing. We had the flounder, grits, corn beef hash, pancakes and bacon. We couldn't even eat it all the portions were so large! Great place for an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting Sunflower restaurant and the service was HORRIBLE. The food was good. Unfortunately, the customer service was terrible. Our waitress was amazing, but the hostess and cashier was rude, irritable, and unprofessional. Prior to being seated, the hostess rolled her eyes as we counted the number of people in our party. This type of body language will make anyone feel very uncomfortable and unwanted. After spending $50 & leaving our waitress a tip well over 20%, I purchased fried shrimp to-go and sat in the chairs in front of the register and waited for my order to be provided to me. The waitress walked by and told me that it would be ready in 10 minutes. I waited 15 minutes and politely asked the cashier if she could provide me with an estimated wait time for my order. She told me that it takes 10 minutes to be cooked. I told her that it had been 15 minutes & her exact response was \"Well we are busy and there is nothing that I can do about that. You'll have to wait.\" Which I didn't mind doing, but her attitude was unnecessary. She forcely pushed the kitchen door open, came back, & told me that it would be 2 minutes. Another 10 minutes goes by.. as I waited I watched the cashier process cash transactions without making eye contact nor smiling at customers. I also saw someone place my food on a shelf under the register area, but I didn't say anything. I waited for the cashier to notice. She finally noticed, with no smile, no apology for the delay she said \"You paid for this right?\" I responded yes ma'am with a smile and she practically threw the food in my hands. At that point, I did not want the food anymore so I asked for a refund. The cashier called the hostess over who just so happens to be her mom and her mom said, \"Well she paid for it so what's the problem? Go tell your dad.\" The waitress went in the kitchen, came back, & processed my refund. There was a party standing at the counter that complained of bad service as well, which is sad because I've heard so many good things about their restaurant. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't the same as others. Their first impressions made a lasting impression and I will never eat there again! Advice: Great customer service is the key to a thriving Organization. The cashier lacks proper customer service skills, but obviously is overworked & may need some help. Today might have just been a bad day, but regardless of the day you're having or how busy it is that shouldnt affect the way that you treat customers."}
{"text":"I had a horrible and totally unexpected experience today at this restaurant with my daughter. The manger Dora was very rude. Upon paying for my food I advised the manger that my daughter had spilled her milk and ask if she could replace my daughter  to go cup of milk.The manger said since you are no longer at the table we cannot replace it.  I advise it was just given to her in a to go cup from your waitresse. The manger still refused to replace my daughter milk as I was proceeding to pay for our meal which was a total of $31. As the waitress started to clean up the table she said \" oh her milk spilled let me run and get your daughter another one\". The manger Dora heard the waitress and said \" no they have gotten up from the table no need to replace her milk\". After experiencing this rude customer service experience from the manger Dora this will be the last time I will be patronizing this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time having breakfast here and I loved it! Price is a little higher than the other breakfast restaurant I go to down the street from here but I can understand why...the quality of the food was good. Especially the salmon cake that I had. I loved the grits also. I also got waffles to go for my daughter and she really like it. The place is small, so it does get crowded, but it's worth it. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I think it was second or third visit, where I overheard a conversation between a waitress and a customer and he was saying how he had just come yesterday and that he loved their food and the waitress responded by saying, \"We don't have one time customers.\" And this my yelp friends is so accurate.

The breakfast here wins me over. It is affordable, it is good eats and feels like home. They always over a daily special. Last visit, I had sausage patties, grits and 2 eggs and white toast for $3.99. They have a vast option of breakfast items and their omelets are pretty good. They aren't overcooked and come in many varieties. It must be a southern thing but if you want fish for breakfast, you can get it here too. 

We recently tried their chicken fried steak and it was not so traditional but very delicious. It was well seasoned, juicy and crispy. The grits are always creamy and well cooked. Served plain so you can season any way you want, sweet or savory. 

They are only open for breakfast and lunch. And depending on the time you go can be very busy. I was shocked at how busy they get. They have definitely have their stream of regulars. I mean the food is good. 

Very easy to call in and pick up your food too. This is definitely a rotation in my family outings. My son loves this place."}
{"text":"awesome service! great food and no matter how busy this place gets, the wait is never long! mad PROPS to the staff for their enduring commitment to serving the community a great product!!"}
