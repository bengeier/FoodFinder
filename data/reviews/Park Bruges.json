{"text":"Ooooh my Gosh Amaziing Brunch!! The Baked Banana Walnut Spiced Rum Crème anglaise stuffed French toast blew my socks off!! The slow Roasted Beef Brisket Potato Hash with sunny side up eggs, Gouda cheese & Horseradish Cream was extra tasty and delish!! Eat it!! No regrets!! Very happy taste buds and belly!! Great Bloody Mary to top it off! I scoped out Everyone else's plates I could see and they all looked wonderful ..."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5, but I'm rounding down.  My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. I was initially surprised by the decor. I'm visiting PGH for the first time, and Park Bruges doesn't look like any other place I've been to so far in PGH. It's modern-ish and I loved it. The staff seemed really relaxed. We were seated immediately, as we were arriving for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. There were about 5 or 7 other tables with customers.  We were given water immediately, and our waitress seemed nice enough. He ordered the Bruges burger, I the grilled veggie melt (I can't remember the name and it's not on the menu on the website), and we shared an order of Bruges frites.  The fries were perfectly salted, but soggy. One of the reasons why it's not 5 stars. They weren't greasy soggy, just soggy. I also like my french fries piping hot, and these weren't burn-your-mouth-hot, so not ideal for me. The roasted garlic dijon mustard that comes with the fries in delish though! I plan on recreating it at home.  My boyfriend says the burger is the best burger he's ever had. The bun to meat ratio is fantastic, and the bun is perfectly toasted. The patty was juicy (as witnessed by me, because it was dripping juices onto his plate) but the bun didn't get soggy at all. As a vegetarian, even I thought the burger looked amazing.  My veggie sandwich was amazing. As silly as it sounds, a good/well made grilled veggie sandwich is hard to come by. Often times the bread will not stand up well to cooked vegetables, and water from the vegetables will drip all over the place. The sandwich has arugula (my fave), grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, tomatoes, feta, hummus, and maybe some other things I can't remember. It was all on a perfectly toasted ciabatta bread. It was crispy enough to hold up to the vegetables, but not so hard that it cuts the roof of your mouth when you bite into it.  My biggest complaint about lunch was the slaw that came with the burger and sandwich. I still haven't figured out what was off about it, but it was not tasty. I seemed oily, and kind of flavorless. With that being said, the sandwich and burger more than made up for a sub optimal coleslaw."}
{"text":"I love the food. I love the beer. I am baffled as to why the take out is so bad.   I called and they left on hold twice till I hung up. When I arrived there was barely anyone there. Awful service."}
{"text":"Park Bruges enjoys a popularity due largely to its location. Until recently, there weren't many alternatives nearby. Now, there are. This is overpriced, overrated pub food, given a meagre bistro makeover. A recent lamb shank was clearly cooked from frozen, and was smothered in a repulsive glut of oily sauce. Mussels are not fresh and are overcooked. It's a testament, unfortunately, to the relative immaturity of the Pgh dining scene that this place still gets great reviews."}
{"text":"Finally, finally, finally, Park Bruges is open! They did a soft opening last night (1/28) that I heard about through a mailing list, and we hightailed down there right after work. I'm glad that we did, because by the time we left at 7 or so, the place was packed.  For those of you who are familiar with Point Brugge, this restaurant does a great job of capturing the same vibe. The booths and tables are spaced so that the cafe has a cozy feel, but you aren't right on top of each other. The bar still dominates the front of the house, which is great for those coming by for a quick drink/snack or for waiting for a table (though there is a small waiting area as well, unlike at Point Brugge). The menu has many familiar items, but also adds some new dishes to the mix (more on that below), and the food is clearly made from fresh ingredients, and is well prepared and delicious. Even though the servers are still learning the menu a bit themselves (like I said, we went on opening night, and a \"soft\" opening at that), they are enthusiastic, friendly, and very helpful.   For those not familiar with Point Brugge, Park Bruges is a Belgian-inspired restaurant, with the feel of a neighborhood cafe. The menu includes traditional Belgian fare, such as moules (mussels) and frites (fries) that are cooked to perfection. They also offer salads (some of which change seasonally), burgers, and typical continental European fare, sometimes with a bit of a twist. They have also added some other dishes that seem to be inspired by Alsace-Lorraine. I ordered a garlic soup and a traditional tarte flambee for dinner, and both were incredibly authentic in their flavors (I lived in Metz, France, for a while). Other dishes at our table include a burger (cooked to exactly the right temperature), a spinach salad with salmon, grilled cheese with tomatoes and rustic bread, and two plates of the frites. All of the food was just right - not too heavy, and not too skimpy, with great flavor profiles even for simple items (like the burger). We also ordered some profiteroles with caramel and ice cream for dessert, which looked great. Unfortunately, I was unable to taste them for this review, because my children inhaled them all in about 30 seconds!  As you would expect from a Belgian cafe, the beer selection was excellent, both on tap and in bottles. The Trois Pistoles and Corsendonk were our favorites (both on draft). Park Bruges also has an extensive wine list, and a very creative selection of cocktails.   Right now, the posted hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 11AM until 10PM (9PM on Sunday). The restaurant is closed on Mondays. Brunch is served until 3PM on Saturday and Sunday (unlike the Sunday-only brunch at Point Brugge).  In summary, I recommend Park Bruges very, very highly. (In fact, I finally stopped just reading Yelp, and set up an account, just to post this as my first review.) Park Bruges is a huge asset to the Highland Park neighborhood, and I know that it will soon be come a destination restaurant for those outside the neighborhood as well, just like its sister venue, Point Brugge."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened a few years back in conjunction with Point Brugge in the Point Breeze neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Although it was a back-up brunch plan to e-squared located on the same street, my friend and I were very pleased with this decision.   I enjoyed the prixe fix menu by choosing the the steak and eggs, potatoes and started it all with a delicious Bloody Mary! It was so good that I ordered a second.   My friend ordered a the crab cake/ Eggs Benedict paired with fresh fruit. When we arrived, there was a line around the building but the service kept up with the demand. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender had the Bloody's in front of us within minutes.   We will be going back because  my friend's favorite beer is currently on tap, Le fin Du Monde. Seasonal I am sure, this restaurant is stays fresh with it's evolving menu based on local crops and other seasonal factors. You can tell the staff at Park Bruege loves what they do!!"}
{"text":"I would actually want to give this place a 3.5, but am leaning more towards a 3 because we weren't wowed by this place and there are limited options on the menu.  The menu is kind of small in my opinion, but it seems that most people go there for the mussels.  We started with Soup of the Day (which at this moment I can not remember, but was it was good!) and House Salad.  Both were slightly above average.  The main thing I liked about the House Salad was the dressing!  Then we got the mussels in the Lobster sauce and braised short ribs.  Mussels were yummy and definitely be my choice if we came back.  The braised short ribs were a little disappointing.  It was cooked pretty well, tender and moist, but I didn't think the flavor was that good.  They also carry Anchor Steam beer here, in case you're a fan of the San Francisco brew."}
{"text":"Awesome meal tonight!  Ordered the muscles in the creole sauce and couldn't have been happier. I have been looking in the area for a nice small restaurant for my wife and I to go on casual dinners out and I think I found my new favorite place.  Yelp definitely helped me find this location as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best brunch locations I've been to.  The location is decent enough - the biggest point for me being ample street parking (on a Sunday morning, at least).    The atmosphere - clean and contemporary.  Some people might find it a bit too sterile, but I thought it suited well for our meal.  The pricing is pretty good - it's a little on the higher end in my opinion, but it's WELL worth it for the amount and quality of food.  The service - excellent service.  As someone who worked as a server for years, I'm pretty critical of waitstaff when I go out to eat.  They didn't disappoint.  The food - Absolutely insanely delicious.  I did their prix fixe brunch which was eggs benedict with rosemary ham, potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa.  The portion was pretty large, but not so large that I couldn't finish it.  Every bite was incredible.    Overall - I'd obviously recommend this place.  I have only been there for the brunch so I'm not sure how other meals stack up, but it's great for a weekend morning.  I'm looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and a very attractive girl works there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here for the first time since the opening, and YUM.   The restaurant seemed to be pretty crowded, but the host did a fantastic job of traffic control and really had people moving in quickly as tables were vacated. Our server was quick and friendly, and my seasonal draft beer (Penn Brewery Chocolate Stout) was fantastic.   Partner and I split the tasty classic poutine, and then each had sandwiches (me: Southwest veggie burger, him: chicken sandwich). Both were good, but not as good as the poutine.   My advice: get here early or late on the weekends, because the place isn't huge (though bigger than its sibling, Point Brugge) and I don't think they take reservations. The waiting area is pretty small (and right in front of the door), which led to some folks waiting in the vestibule. The bar area is sort of cramped and busy, meaning that if you can't grab a barstool, you're likely to be blocking traffic and moving out of the way quite a bit.    Try the poutine and the beers on tap. I'm definitely coming back for a tarte flambe!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place for brunch this morning and it did not disappoint! We were able to sit outside, no wait, friendly staff, and great food! I highly recommend the chorizo burger, your tastebuds and stomach will thank you. Also, the bathrooms were really clean lol, I appreciate that at any establishment!"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip out to Bryant Street in Highland Park.  Be aware that Park Bruges does not take reservations, so your best bet is probably heading out for an early or late dinner.  Otherwise, this place fills up fast and you may be stuck with a long wait.    My boyfriend and I chose to dine here on Valentine's weekend, and had not trouble getting a table for 2 around 8:30pm.  Great European beer selection, with nice wine and cocktail lists as well.  The service was fabulous.  I really wish I could remember our server's name...she was totally sweet and went out of her way to answer our questions about the menu.  I'm not typically a fan of mussels, but these are not to be missed.  We went with the green curry preparation as per the recommendation of our server.  After we finished off the mussels, we used the loaves of crusty bread to mop up the rest of the curry.  If curry isn't your thing, they offer two other sauces: classic white wine and spicy creole.  For our meals, I went with the Grouper Special, while my boyfriend chose the Faroe Island Salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, although next time I would probably order the salmon myself!  The portions were generous, especially for the price.  This is a solid spot for a casual, laid-back dining experience.  Great food options, friendly service, and usually pretty easy to find parking on Bryant Street.  Can't wait to come back soon for brunch!"}
{"text":"I think i just found my new favorite Sunday brunch spot!   Everything my friends and I ordered was great! Everything that we ordered tasted fresh and was interesting, a little bit different from your standard eggs and bacon (but you can get that if you want :) ).   I ordered the tarte flambée. It was what i would call a breakfast pizza with a Mexican flare (chorizo and pico de gallo were involved). It was DELICIOUS! So fresh and flavorful! The portion was huge though, a could have definitely split it with someone. But don't worry,  I also ordered the special waffle of the day (fat kid alert!), because hey, I can't just order something super Mexican at a Belgium place right? The waffle of the day was pineapple strawberry. The waffle was great, especially the fresh fruit topping. there is nothing like real fruit on waffles!   The only let down was they didn't have espresso. But hey, you can order beer with brunch so it makes up for it.   A must do in Highland Park!"}
{"text":"French fries are amazing! Very good service and the quality is even better. I ordered a hamburger with cheese"}
{"text":"We go all of the time and yes, it's consistently good. But we know the dishes that we like and the ones that we don't prefer. The mussels are good when mussels are in season, but really, i've ordered the moules frites when the mussels have been so small that i'm not even sure why they bother serving the dish when they can't get a good product. the flatbreads are yummy. my fiance loves the burger and the pork chops. the mac and cheese is good and the fries are always yummy."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed everything I've gotten from here. I highly recommend coming for brunch. They have a good sized brunch menu with amazing waffles."}
{"text":"I dined here with 2 buddies this past monday . We all loved the moules frites in white wine and shared a decadent chocolate dessert. The service was excellent as well as the setting was cozy, it was not noisy like most eateries. Although I favor Point Brugge, I'd return to this area."}
{"text":"The food is well prepared, fresh Belgian standards. There's obviously a solid commitment to quality of preparation and ingredients. The dishes are largely unchallenging (mussels, steak frite, chicken breast) and the only time the quality of the food dips is when they stray into slightly more imaginative territory. THE FRIES WILL ELEVATE YOUR SPIRIT TO A WORLD OF PURE FATTY BLISS.   Their brunch menu is great with a wide range of good options and a nice pre-fixe menu that comes with an entree, side, and a brunch cocktail. The brunch poutine will also keep you full for a week. Be sure to arrive right at opening or several hours after opening for brunch, or you'll be in line forever."}
{"text":"Delicious and expertly prepared food.  Service is top-notch and ambiance is authentic.  Favorites are mussels in wine sauce and flatbread.  The sauce for the mussels could be served as a beverage!"}
{"text":"This is the first 5-star review I've given in a long time.  It's hard to live up to the hype, especially that PGH yelpers tend to label everything the \"Best in Pittsburgh.\"  In my experience, that label has been placed on very questionable places.  This place, however, is a homerun.  For a Sunday brunch, I couldn't be happier.  The much-touted mussels were as great as advertised.  The mussels are in a brilliant and delicious broth, which you just want to drink straight up.  And the bread is a perfect fluff with a crunchy crust to soak up the juices.  The serving sizes are large -- and for around $10-14 per entree, it's head-scratching how they can make a profit.  You get a LOT of smoked salmon with your eggs benedict, you get a LOT of lamb with your Moroccan eggs, and you get a pizza sized Torte Flambe.  In addition, the service was excellent.  The food was out quickly, the waitstaff walked the tables offering coffee refills (a welcome change from having to track them down!), and they were friendly and helpful with the menu items.  Based on all the previous reviews, there are several items I'm eager to try next time.  I don't think you can ask for anything more."}
{"text":"I used to like the mussels here but lately they've been puny and disappointing. That could be seasonal. But the rest of the menu has gotten really lazy and not good. For lunch I ordered \"torte flambé\" which was literally a toasted pita (Belgian ?) with some dry ham chunks and bland cheese and a pathetic sprinkling of parsley. No flavor and dry and how is pita bread a torte ? I have two stars because the frites are still delicious. But that's just salt. Thanks."}
{"text":"I usually go to Point Bruges - but, Park Bruges is just a good..... fabulous food and huge portions!  Small plate of mussels and a salad... perfect!  My table mates had the steak salad and the dinner special (snapper) -- terrific!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with an interesting assortment of menu items. I recommend the poutine or the roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pgh brunch spots. Always delicious and fresh. Had the omelet special last time, chile relleno omelet, it was fantastic. And the poutine is hard to refuse. Also, try the crab beignets for an appetizer, so good. The bartender/server on the weekends is super friendly and always makes a good reccommendation. Also good beer selections. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I like the menu at point Brugge better but this is nice for a change of scenery.  I was luck to get a table outside.   Service here is always great. Fast and friendly.   We had some great drinks while waiting for some appetizers. Our group shared the mussels as this is their staple!!!   Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice and attentive, the food was great, and the dessert was decadent. I had the lamb shank and my wife had the special of roast duck, both were moist and delicious. We finished the night off with a wonderful piece of chocolate cake. We had a really good time."}
{"text":"I am basing my review on brunch-only.  The food is phenomenal (especially liege waffles or eggs benedict).  Coffee is brewed perfectly and the service is always solid.  The wait can be long, but they try to move people through quickly.  I think the quality and experience here trumps their sister restaurant, Point Bruges."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes... This is the place I have been looking for.  Excellent moules frites and long list of belgian beers with some hard-to-find selections on draft!  I was not overwhelmingly impressed with the flat bread or poutine appetizers, but the outstanding mussels more than make up for that in my mind.  I was so busy gorging myself on mussels and beer that I barely remembered to speak to my fellow diners... Sorry friends - I'm an antisocial diner with food this good in front of me."}
{"text":"Love love love Park Brugge! Moules - both preparations are incredible. Poutine is best in Pittsburgh. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"I dined here with 2 friends this past Tuesday. We all enjoyed the moules frites in white wine and shared a decadent chocolate dessert. The service was great and the atmosphere was comfortable, it wasn't noisy like most eateries. Although I prefer Point Brugge, I would return to this place."}
{"text":"Oh my. Where do I begin? Well in my eyes it starts with the mussels. White. Wine Garlic Sauce is to die for. A tradition I have with my beautiful mom as we sit and enjoy a night out with each other. The poutine fresh from our great neighbors up in Montreal is excellent. Park Brogues never disappoints. It is a little small but you know what the tightness hasn't bothered me yet, so nothing to complain about here. A Pittsburgh MUST if you haven't tried it out yet. MC"}
{"text":"If you love point brugge, you're going to love park brugge.  The menu's slightly different, but both have the essential Belgian beer and Mussels."}
{"text":"I'm glad I visited! I enjoyed the locality and ambiance. We ordered Classic Moules-frites, Arugula salad, and the charcuterie board. Mussels were great, but fries and Arugula salad were even better! Very nice bread, too!   Three stars for the charcuterie board, though -- it was meat only. Nothing really stood out. I wish it offered a variety of meat, cheese, crackers, pickles, etc.    Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Ever since Park Bruges opened it has been great to enjoy the same quality as Point Brugge in a larger, more open space with less need for a wait.  This is a great go-to brunch location on a weekend....although the menu is slightly different than its sister location of Point Brugge some of the essentials remain such as Liege waffles (a must have!) and mussels (moules frites for brunch - why not?)  The brunch menu does change from time to time and while not all the choices are always top hits (some strange combos) it's always fun to try something new."}
{"text":"Great service and beer selection. Mussels, pork chop, and steak with frites are highlights."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was not crowded and it was shortly before the time when they stop serving brunch. Our waitress brought the brunch menu to us but told us that we'd better hurry and order in the next two minutes or we can't get brunch. When we asked to see the lunch menu, she said, I'll give it to you but you are going to have to wait a while before they start serving lunch. We ordered brunch and were served the food but not once did the waitress check to see how we were doing. We had to flag another server to  get us condiments and to ask for our bill. She finally brought our bill and then we had to wait until she finished her conversation with the bartender. I could understand the neglect and the wait if the restaurant was busy but it was not even 1/4 full. Normally, we like the food and are happy with the service but this waitress was terrible. I only wish I had her name. When we were leaving, we had to exit through the side door because my pregnant daughter was on crutches. I went ahead of her to get the car and they could see she was struggling to open the door but three servers and the bartender ignored her so that they could continue with their very important personal conversation. Incredibly rude."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, as it is walking distance from my house, and have never been disappointed.  Everything is delicious, but you MUST try the moules frites and steak frites!  During warmer weather the patio is open and dog friendly, which is a huge plus in my book (they also bring water out for your dog)."}
{"text":"I took one of my snooty foodie friends from Manhattan here and we both loved it! Everything was great, the food, the service, and Mmmmm, the Belgian tripel ale, OMG! Easily the best beer I've had in the past 10 years. The Moules frites are not to be missed, they were wonderful. The Eggs Benedict was also very tasty. Some day I should move to within walking distance of the Park Bruges Cafe, and eat there at least 52 times per year. Well actually the only thing that might stop me is that there is sometimes a line to get in, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"If I don't need to wait, I'll love it even more.  I came here twice after dinner at teppanyaki.... One was to let a friend try the mussels because he was leaving Pittsburgh soon. The other time I was just craving for fries since we had a light dinner.  Mussels, tasty mussels! My favorite part is to eat the bread after dipping them in the sauce. I loved the frites in my first visit, but I was never surprised by them afterwards. They're still good though.  They have good Sunday brunch. I like the waffles. It has a different texture form the one on Murray. The french toast with salmon is also delicious."}
{"text":"After church, my 7-year-old daughter wanted to have lunch \"in the city.\"  I had hoped to visit Point Brugge.  They were running a 45 minute wait.    So, I called over to Park Bruges in Highland Park and no wait at all.  I asked the hostess if the place OK for kids and she immediately replied: \"But of course!\"  I appreciate that kind of warm welcome for kid diners.  By the time we arrived, we ended up having to wait a few minutes as the place was slammed all of a sudden and a few tables were in the process of tabbing out.  No problem, it gave me and my daughter time to look over the menu where nearly every item sounded like something I wanted to try.  Deciding on what to order was no easy task.  In the end, my daughter went with the mac and cheese (but of course, she's 7!).  I would order this myself next time!  I had a few bites and it was really good.  I ordered the special - beef short rib hash.  Heavenly.  The beef was melt in your mouth good, crispy potatoes and veggies.  Plus, it came with a brunch beverage - the spicy bloody mary went great with what I ordered.  (You can choose between a mimosa, beer cocktail, glass of prosecco or a bloody mary.)    Maybe I'm just getting older and cranky but I'm finding that Sunday brunch is a lost art these days.  Sunday brunch does not equal silver tins of sausage and bacon and a waffle station.  I can get both at the Residence Inn and it's free with my room.  But we were both very pleased with Sunday brunch at Park Bruges in every way: ambience (sleek without being stuffy), service (incredibly friendly and welcoming to me and my kid, very attentive), food (delicious!) and value (I love when my entree comes with a choice of brunch beverage).  Can't wait to go back on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed coming here for Brunch. I've always loved Point Brugge and still think the menu is more diverse but won't complain when there's a plate of fries and aioli mayonnaise in front of me. An extremely nice staff and a very friendly environment."}
{"text":"Since we have been going regularly to the Park over the last couple of years, I thought it was time to provide a review.  This is our favorite Pittsburgh restaurant.  Living in the South Hills, we typically make the journey to Highland Park on Saturdays, so we are most familiar with the weekend brunch menu.  We have never had a bad experience here.  It's hard to try everything on the brunch menu because the specials are so tempting or we often re-order the items we've found that we really like.  My wife usually gets the Omelet of the Day since they are so varied and delicious.  My favorites in order of preference from the brunch menu are steak and eggs, slow roasted beef brisket potato hash, and open faced BLT.  On the dinner menu, the Gerber Farms roasted half chicken is worth the time needed to prepare.  Of course, the frites and mussels are always recommended."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Park Bruges, but I've gone for lunch several times. Steak, fries and a great beer... What more could I ask for? Lunch prices are quite reasonable for the quality, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Park Bruges is my go to restaurant for date night with my husband.  I love their specialty drink list.  Some of my favorite menu items are: creole mussels, Mediterranean platter, frites, and Bruges burger.  Food is fresh and flavorful and service has always been on point."}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes today. Didn't mind since it was 2 degrees out and the warmth in this cute and cozy place was welcome. Not my first visit but first time for brunch. I ordered a selection that came with sunny side up eggs and honestly don't think any egg should be eaten with the white uncooked because I find it disturbing....but more power to those who can! Ordered them over easy instead. They came out a second's worth of cooking from being over hard. A waste of a good egg also in my opinion. I need it to be cooked white with yellow nice and runny. The perfect over easy egg. So I sent them back. Came out less than 3 minutes later.... Hmmmm. Obviously on these and first attempt the grill was way too high with crispy edges to eggs. Their second try it appeared they turned them over for just long enough to not be called sunny side up because when I cut into them the white below the surface was clear and runny.  Ok. A lot of dialogue for eggs, but if you're gonna serve brunch have someone in the kitchen who knows how to cook eggs!  Today wasn't that day apparently. Sent my meal back (and did not order anything else) but did enjoy my Mimosa!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal at the Park!! The food is always superb and the service outstanding - particularly from Amanda and Deveney!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch today, \"small order\" of mussels in the curry basil sauce, OMG--it was amazingly and too big to eat alone!  Served with crusty bread that you can use to sop up the liquid--honestly, it was fabulous. Dad ordered the cream of mushroom soup and their beef dish, son ordered their onion soup a chicken gyro--not one complaint and the plates were empty when we were done!"}
{"text":"My review covers Sunday brunch. Points for attentive service with personality and for cooking with butter instead of processed vegetable oils.   The food: Parmesan & Herb Biscuits  I will preface this by saying I was fortunate enough to date a girl from the mid-west once who was an amazing cook that made the best biscuits and sausage gravy I've ever tasted to this day - so I have high standards.  The good: Portion size somewhat in line with the price tag. Eggs and biscuits were well done. Didn't skimp on the amount of sausage in the gravy.   The bad: Bland. Meh all over again. Despite all of that suasage the gravy was still surprisingly void of any flavor. More black pepper may have helped, but wouldn't have completely solved it.   In the end, after years of watching, I can simply do better at home. Lastly, as others have commented, it gets LOUD in here, not my cup of tea as far as atmosphere goes. Not likely to return.   Meh. That about covers it."}
{"text":"Shouldn't have been too surprised by how absolutely fabulous our brunch was, when we arrived just 7 min. After they opened and took the last table available! From there it just got better. No complaints at all. Zero. The food was amazing and the staff was quick and pleasant! Will def be back again! And again. And again. And again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! 10 Family members aged 7 to 70 all very happy with our meals. The mussels were amazing- plump, beautifully presented and plentiful. The bread was fresh, with crisp crust- much was needed to mop up all the delicious broth from the mussels. The cheeseboard was a delicious education. Every entree, we had Steak Frites, cooked just right, Chicken Milanese which made us actually stop and say \"Wow!\" Creole Shrimp and Grits, and Gemelli pasta, was delicious. Portions were generous. Somehow we made room for dessert, cheesecake and apple tartine...apple melted in your mouth. Food done right! The service was friendly and helpful. We were celebrating two family birthdays and left very happy- not because of the wine and beer- although that was good too!"}
{"text":"You'll get good food guaranteed.  Mussels, of course, are great.  Bruges burger - get it.  Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, soups, entrees, etc... all top-notch.  Plus great draft beers... maybe 4 or 5 only, and all great.  Only minus is that the decor is a bit bland and kind of dated in a late 1990s way.  Layout could be a little better too - the rear of the restaurant feels cramped with booths and small tables in the middle.  Sit up front if you can."}
{"text":"Really nice place. I've only had lunch here, though I'd like to come back for their weekend brunch sometime.  It's (relatively) small inside, but well-kept. As is common in Europe, the water comes with no ice, and it's served at room-temperature. I had the classic Montreal poutine and steak frites, which ended up being more frites than I could eat; unfortunate, because they were really good. Overall, the staff there seem to really enjoy and care about their establishment, which shows through the final product very well."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant,  but was expecting a lot more looking at the pictures.  From a vegetarian standpoint the food was good but not great.  I might need to try some other dishes but the waffles were much better at Waffles Incaffinated than here.  The poutine should have been good but it uses chicken broth so couldn't try.  Either way this ambience was nice will try again and see."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go with my boyfriend. We've had two really solid experiences here, with delicious, comforting food and excellent service. I love the ambiance, and I love walking around Highland Park after dinner. I definitely recommend this place for a great, easy dinner with friends and family. When I move into the city I'm going to become a regular here, and I cannot wait!"}
{"text":"The star I subtracted from my review for Point Brugge returns here due to the vastly improved seating / atmosphere within the restaurant.  It's really nice to be able to comfortably sit in a spacious restaurant that doesn't get so loud as to impede conversation.  Other than that, the food at this restaurant was excellent just as at Point Bruges.  I've had multiple preparations of the fresh mussels and they are all excellent.  I've also sampled the various other dishes that my girlfriend has ordered, and those were excellent as well.  I also appreciate the friendliness and promptness of the staff.  Overall, this is a great restaurant that you should definitely visit if you're in the area looking for some food on the pricier side."}
{"text":"After walking 4 miles around the community yard sale we were looking for a bite to eat. Stopped in and was not disappointed. Everything was made fresh, they use fresh seasonal fruit which was excellent. If there were any negatives our waitress was not very attentive, however we did notice the other tables did not have the same issue with their waitresses. Also the white sangria was not the greatest but overall we would definitely come back if In the area again. If you are looking for something different, delicious, and freshly made then this is your place."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday... Had the mussels in white wine, pasta with butternut squash, pecan pie for dessert and cocktails, everything was just delicious!!!! I can't wait to go back. The menu is the perfect size, all Dishes sounded great, it was hard to choose. They also sport specialty, local liqueurs. Super awesome place! Price is right as well! Yum! Oh... Staff, excellent as well."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner Sunday evening with a friend. We were both craving seafood and my friend had their mussels here once before. So upon her suggestion, we came here. The food was delicious and fresh and came very quickly. I also had their IPA beer with my meal and that beer was good too. My friends' Mediterranean appetizer was tasty as well. We really enjoyed our food and the service was great. I'd definitely return here in the future. But in the meantime try their mussels dish in white wine sauce. It was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the food and service were phenomenal each time. Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have a lot of food allergies, but they have always been able to accommodate me and given me multiple choices besides. The servers and friendly and gracious. They seem truly invested in providing a delightful experience to their diners. If I want to impress anyone from out of town, Park Bruges is my first choice. Definitely go, you won't be disappointed. Oh and get the frites!"}
{"text":"On a cold day in Pittsburgh, my daughter and I headed to Highland Park to eat lunch before going to a movie. The restaurant we planned to visit (on our list of must-try) had a 1-hour wait, so we checked out this nearby restaurant. My daughter ordered the Citrus Ricotta French Toast. It was OK, but lacked sweetness. The fruit sauce of raspberry-passion fruit was tart when a little sweetness would have been welcome with this dish. Fresh fruit of cantalope, honeydew, pineapple, grapes and strawberries accompanied this. The melons being out-of-season now were without flavor and did not compliment the dish. This was something we would not order again. I ordered the Baked Eggs Cassoulet which was excellent with the taste of one of my favorites, bean soup. The eggs added to the idea of a brunch item. We also ordered the Classic Montreal Poutine to share. This is a dish we would order again and again with perfectly fried potatoes, just the right amount of gravy and cheese curds. We scarfed them down neglecting our other food since the poutine would not be good for take-home. We plan to return here to sample some other things like the Brunch Burger, Southern Style Crabcakes or my standby weekend brunch item, Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I like this place, though I don't feel as excited about it as I do Point Brugge.  Went in on a recent Saturday night at about 8:30, were told there would be an hour-and-a-half wait, and waited about 45 minutes.  On this trip I focused on trying all of the things that were new on the menu.  We got the poutine, which could hardly be anything but delicious with those fries and cheese curds from Arsenal Cheese in Lawrenceville.  I also had the garlic soup, which I was really excited about, but didn't love.  The soup was monotonously starchy, with little to break it up or add interest, and even the cheese on top failed to excite.  We finished with a large order of the mussels, the new spicy Creole preparation with andouille sausage, peppers, onions, celery and crumbled Maytag Bleu.  These were very good, though I am sure I will order my traditional white wine order next time. Ah, we are creatures of habit!    The decor is, true, sterile and, ok, a bit bland, but in a clean, modern way, I thought.  It's hard not to compare this to such a memorable predecessor, and it's not exactly the same, true, but this is still a fine restaurant and worth a visit."}
{"text":"I would say that there's better places for brunch in Pittsburgh than Park Bruges, however, they do a good job with the dishes they have. I thoroughly enjoyed the French Toast - stuffed with apples.   I felt like their Tarte Flambee could have more of a kick to it, a little too bland considering the description on the menu reads, \"chorizo & potato hash, corn, cheddar cheese, shirred eggs, pico de gallo.\"  Overall - not too bad for the price. Great for a lazy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Very cute location. 99.9% satisfied. Went for late lunch and hostess was a bit slow to seat but we sat outside and it was lovely. Our waiter was attentive but not too over baring. He made suggestions and was extremely helpful. The authentic Belgian fries with the Amish curds were to die for. I also had the salad with local grown greens and added salmon. Best seared salmon I've had in a long time. Very citrusy. A+ highly recommend. Cool spot in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is great. The Bruges Burger was probably the best burger I've had. And the atmosphere is so quaint - exactly what you'd expect a Belgian brasserie to feel like. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Did I mention that I had my first experience with mussels here and fell in love with them? Because I surely did.   Great place,  worth all the hype.  I'll definitely be back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"This place will fill your belly! Good food great beer and amazing service!"}
{"text":"\"If I was born on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I wasn't and I'm not, so it doesn't\" -Colin Farrell, IN BRUGES   I must respectfully disagree Mr. Farrell. Park Bruges thoroughly impressed me with their variety of classical Belgian dishes, friendly and competent staff, cozy location and impressive beer list.  My ever present girlfriend and I met a few friends at Park Bruges one Tuesday evening for some dinner. It was a beautiful night so we opted to sit outside (it was also the only remaining four top in the restaurant). Since we were the second to arrive, our friends already had a table outside. Therefore, I will refrain from reviiwing the atmosphere inside the actual restaurant for the time being. I am going back so look for it in either another review, or an edit of this one. What I did see through the large picture window looked like a cozy little place with a nice bar and seating for maybe 40.  To lead off any good meal, I think you need a good beer. Park Bruges certainly comes through in that department. While their draft selection is a little limited, they more than make up for it by having a very, very nice selection of bottles, both Belgian and craft/import. This is a big plus for my friend, Jon, a Belgian beer nut, who likes Park Bruges even more than I do. While I respect the Belgian ales, and do partake on occassion, I like a greater variety than the yeasty sweetness you get in those particular styles, and the melange of other options pleased me greatly.  The service was very good also. Our server was nice, attentive, and informative, a great combination for a waitress. She always made sure our glasses were never empty, our old plates were always quickly whisked away almost as soon as we were done, and we always had plenty of fresh bread. This is very important as you will see in a minute.  On to the main event, the food. I went there expecting to get a nice meal, maybe an appetizer, dessert, and main. That all went out the window when I saw the menu and wanted everything on it. That's usually a good sign so I went with my gut (literally, I was starving) and loaded up on slald, soup, fries, a burger, mussels, and dessert. Yes I am a fatass, but at least I am a happy fatass.  For the salad I got the regular house salad tossed in a champagne vinegarette. Overall, I remember it being a good salad, but the other items I had kind of overshadowed it, so sorry I can't be a little more detailed. As my salad was coming out, my friends were getting their onion soups. One look and a whif later I am chasing down the waitress to get one for myself. One of the better ideas I have had in some time if I may say. It came out piping hot, like a good onion soup should, and somthered in creamy, melty,emmental cheese. The apples they put in it kind of threw me through a loop, but it was a good loop to be sure.  The next item I got was the PEI mussels in a classic garlic, onion, white wine, and cream sauce. They mussels were cooked well so they were firm, but not rubbery. The sauce they were in was the true star of the dish. I was a little thinner than what I would have made myself, but it tasted fantastic. This is where all that extra bread came in handy. They didn't even need to rinse the plate after I got through with it.  For dinner I got the Bruges Burger with coleslaw and an order of the pomme frites. The burger was cooked medium rare, like I like it and the shredded short ribs mixed with the creamy gruyere was a delightful little pop to the sandwich. It was a good burger, not the best I have had, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. The fries were also done properly as well. They were double fried and seasoned well (take note Pittsburgh, crispy, salty fries are invading and I am telling them where to find resistance fighters) and the garlic mayo added the perfect bit of zazz to go with them.  For dessert we had a stout infused Belgian waffle with a homemade chocolate-candied walnut ice cream. It was good, and a manager told me it was an experiment, but I felt it fell a little flat. The stout just made the waffle taste burned, but the ice cream, the truly good part, covered up the flavor well. I would liked to have seen perhaps a fruit sorbet with the stout waffle, or maybe a Lindeman's Framboise, or Kriek infused waffle with the same ice cream.  All said and done, I really enjoyed my visit to Park Bruges. I wish that I could have rated them higher, but it was just a few flaws that kept them out of the top slot. I gave them the \"Yay, I'm a fan!\" rating because the one or two little misteps kept them out of the realm of \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\". Park Bruges may not be as good as it gets, but they are pretty damn close. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic muscles, fantastic frites.  I hate to say I haven't explored much else on the menu since the muscles are so great!"}
{"text":"Loved this brunch! I had been here for dinner before but Highly recommend coming for brunch. No reservations and the line starts around 10:45am so get there early. Restaurant was filled immediately. Service was excellent. Menu has something for everyone depending on what you are craving and they always have delicious sounding specials as well. I ordered the Tarte Flambee which was huge (ended up taking half of the tarte home and topping it with two more eggs for breakfast the next day) and a side of liege waffle because those are the best waffles known to man. Per the servers suggestion I had it topped with chocolate but next time I would opt for syrup. Beautiful presentations and I loved all the variety on the menu. Living in the local neighborhood I can promise I will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Very warm and cheerful service! We had curry mussels (the moules dish) and the classic Tarte Flambee.   Mussels were pretty good, only had a few but it was definitely tasty. The tarte flambee had a good crusty base and delicious savory toppings - the whole thing was kind of like a thin crispy pizza.  Overall, had a good time here! We were in quite a rush and really appreciated the server accommodating us."}
{"text":"I didn't think mussels got any better than the red curry mussels at the original Point Bruges, but I was wrong.  The green curry mussels here are amazing, a little spicey for some, but I couldn't stop eating.  I had the short ribs for dinner which was good.  I ordered it because it comes with a parsnip puree.  This was good, but not as good as the only other time i've had it."}
{"text":"Sigh. This was a delicious brunch.  We tried everything from the Fritatta of the day, Mussels, Waffles, Brunch burger, and the Crab beignets.    The bloody mary was excellent. (it could have been my state of hangover but this could have been the most miraculous thing I've ever had to drink)  The Mussels - as usual for Pointe/Park Bruges were delicious. They deliver. Always.  The only place in pittsburgh that even compares for mussels is Monterey Pub on the North Shore.  Everything else was top-notch.  The variety was excellent - plenty of brunchy items - but good mix of the their specialties.    Writing this now makes me want to go back this weekend. I'm upgrading from 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"As much as I L-O-V-E-D Park Bruges' concept (menu, actual food, service, etc.) the only thing that bothers me about it is the decoration and look of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, it's clean, chic and super trendy, standing out in the quiet neighborhood of Highland Park. However, I'd expect something a bit more in theme with \"Belgium.\"   Besides that, everything works. The beer selection is modest but incredibly diverse (we tried: 3 Philosophers, Hoegaarden White, and Grimbergen Blond). The PEI Mussels in classic white wine sauce are not to be missed. Mussels the size of your fat aunt's large toe (a.k.a. very big), and so succulent you can't help but lick the plate after you're done.  I'd love to come back in the summer and sample other beers on a hot day."}
{"text":"We had a delightful dinner at this restaurant. We ordered scallops, steak frites, and one of their mussel bowls. All were delicious. The mussels were among the very best I've ever had, not a single closed one in the bowl, broth was excellent. Scallops were served with great accompaniments. Portions were very generous as well - we all left stuffed and satisfied, wishing we had saved more room for dessert.   This restaurant has a nice decor, very pleasant and open. Service was very attentive, waitress kept bringing more bread to dip in the mussels broth and kept our coffee cups filled.   One of the best meals we've had in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite at Park Bruges. The rest of the food is great, too, and the atmosphere is really relaxed yet classy. Monday night jazz (not during the summer) is a blast!"}
{"text":"We went here for weekend brunch. The cocktails were delicious and food was bomb! This was my first time having breakfast poutine which I definitely would order again. They also have outdoor seating in the Warmer seasons and are pet friendly which is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Park is not the best Bruges that's ever been a Pittsburgh Bruges, but it's certainly a fine Bruges.  You see, Park Bruges, has green curry mussels and Point Bruges has Red Curry.  Maybe Park = Green.  Maybe there's some other cause.  I don't know.  But I do know that Green is not as good as Red.  So there.  When you're there, do get a Belgoo beer, they're amazing.  The burger is also a stand out."}
{"text":"Great place!  Never had a bite I didn't like! The food is great, nice and imaginative, very lively flavors.  The atmosphere is absolutely awesome! The waiters are very kind and agreeable, adding to the overall convivial environment inside the Point.  Very nice place.  Go there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall, it was pretty good. Nothing extremely impressive, but food was good! My husband and I came here with two of our friends on a Friday night and we all ordered different dishes. We started with the classic version of Tarte Flambe (the version with the ham). This flatbread was phenomenal and it was hard to share because I'm sure everyone wanted the whole thing to themselves. The hubby ordered Bay of Fundy Salmon and I, the Moules Frites (classic white wine). Although the salmon was nothing all too special, the mussels were so worth it! Amazing, I tell you. I love that they also give you a French baguette for dipping. I've ordered mussels frites at other places in town that don't include bread. You need something to soak up the sauce! I hope to make it back soon to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Always a good expérience. I wish they had some filtered blinds  in part of the back dining room---but the food is always very tasty. Wait staff is on top of their game."}
{"text":"We arrived here at 2pm on a Saturday and after reading all the raving reviews I expected a decent wait. It was actually very quick seating into a casual dining area. They have a great selection of seasonal beers and cocktails. The menu is simple and to-the-point which makes for an easy decision making process. Our server was nice but in a forced sort of way, not very personable. I'll be back in to try new menu items."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch. The star of the show was the Tarte flambée, an excellent French flatbread/pizza covered in creamed leaks, eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Excellent! Friendly wait staff. Clean and contemporary. Try the mussels with the beurblanc sauce and crusty French bread...amazing!"}
{"text":"There are two things to have at Park Bruges. First, mussels in either a  traditional or in a seasonal broth. The rest of the menu is fine, too. Second, something from their bar. Their female bartender is approachable, efficient, knowledgeable and unobtrusive. Their beers and spirits are carefully selected. If a tall red-haired woman is your waitress, you're all set. She leads without pushing. The only trouble with the place is some of the waiting customers. They get in your space and pounce for your spot at the front, but once you're seated at a table away from the bar, it's safe."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and each time has been great.  The meat and cheese plate is very good, and the entrees are fresh and cooked to perfection.  There is a decent wine selection and the bar tenders are friendly.  Arrive early, as this place fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal and the service was great. Tried the trout - crispy skin, mustard sauce with shaved brussel sprouts, garbanzos and radishes and no bones! Loved it and Will come back again"}
{"text":"I guess they are known for their mussels but they were out of stock.. could've been that 5star, but the other foods were fairly good as well."}
{"text":"The poutine was terrific.  The portions are huge -- the appetizers are meals unto themselves.  Very classy vibe, yet not stuffy.  Try the poutine"}
{"text":"The best brunch spread I've had in a while.  We planned to catch up over brunch and my high school friend suggested Park Bruges. It was nearby and we were scheduled to arrive right when it opened. Luckily they had one outdoor table open which we promptly snagged.  Service was a bit spotty in the beginning, although we noticed the place filled up shortly after we arrived. It's harder to grab the servers' attention when outside, so keep that in mind if you're sitting there.  We decided to do a family style meal and ordered the crab cake eggs benedict, their chicken and waffles special, the breakfast poutine, and the ricotta donuts. It took about 15-20 minutes to get our food, but it was all served at the same time and wow oh wow, what a spread! Just the picture of these items is enough for a good rating. But I was even more blown away by the taste.  I went for a donut first and bam! I knew we were in for a treat. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, they were the best textural experience. The dipping sauces were also perfect, chocolatey for something heavier and a fruity strawberry rhubarb for something lighter. Both sauces weren't too sweet, which I really appreciated, and they didn't feel too heavy as donuts normally do.  The breakfast poutine was very well made. The fries were fried very crispy, and the presentation was beautiful. To be honest though, I didn't love the sausage gravy. The flavor was a bit flat and after the fifth or sixth bite, it felt a bit boring. Something herby or a bit of kick I think would've helped.  The crab cake eggs benedict, wow. First off, beautifully arranged; I didn't want to disturb it. The colors of the hollandaise down to the fruit made it quite the portrait. The egg was perfectly poached and that bite with everything on it was just incredible. Good flavor, great texture, and all around one of the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The challah was also a nice, deliberate touch.  The chicken and waffles weren't as pretty but equally tasty. The cheddar chive waffle batter was no joke. The cheesy, oniony flavor really came through and paired so well with their fluffy buttermilk fried chicken counterpart. I believe the cut was a boneless chicken breast, but it wasn't dry whatsoever. The final touch, the habanero honey, sealed the deal. You got sweet, salty, fluffy, crispy, meaty, and cheesy flavor explosion with a little kick in one bite. Game over.  Prices are what I'd expect for brunch, ($13-16 per entree), and despite the average service, the food and environment were phenomenal. I would highly recommend a weekend brunch here if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I think this is the restaurant I've been to the most in Pittsburgh. Some of that is the convenience. I can walk here, but I really enjoy the food too. It gets pretty crowded and unfortunately they don't take reservations. When the weather is nice, there is usually a line when they open for brunch, and they have outdoor seating, but only 3 tables so if you want one, get there early. Or, they do take out, so if you want a lazy day on the couch with delicious food, you can call in your order and pick it up to avoid the crowds.   The absolute best thing on the menu is the mussels. They are so good and they usually have 3-4 different flavors you can try. I love the classic white wine sauce, but they also have a green curry, which is delicious and slightly spicy. You also get french bread to soak up all the yummy sauce when you're done. They have two sizes of mussels: 1 pound or 1.5 pound with fries. The fries are really good and crispy. They're just seasoned with salt, but the crispiness and large flakes of salt are what make them so good.  I enjoy their prix fixe brunch special. Tasty mimosas and my favorite is the crab cake eggs benedict. Eggs benedict is my favorite brunch dish and the crab and spicy hollandaise work really well. And as weird as it sounds, the best brunch side is just their bacon. Nice and thick, with the right amounts of chewy and crispy. I really want to buy it to cook at home.  The decor is a little boring but seats are comfortable and I'm always so focused on the food and conversation that I don't mind the simplicity. It gets a little loud in there also, but I can still hear my table's conversation, so that's okay too."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this location as we usually go to Point Brugge.  We always order the moules and frites with white wine sauce.   I left pretty disappointed.  While it has the same vibe as Point Brugge, I found the food didn't taste the same.  The white wine sauce was much more saltier and less flavorful.  It was a sharp salty taste that I couldn't get pass.  It didn't enhance the moules like it should have.  Frites were the only thing that was good.  Staff isn't as friendly or quick as Point Brugge.  I think the only benefit to going here is that you don't have to wait around for a table as much.  I think I know why though."}
{"text":"Point Brugge in a bigger space.  (That's a good thing.)  It's about the same menu, same good service levels - solid meal.  We had mussels when we went on a Tuesday evening, my usual standby at the other location.  (The lobster-Pernod sauce is good, but the white wine and garlic is the best.)    Service was excellent.  The space is larger than the other location, but it was still surprisingly packed on a Tuesday evening.    Not sure exactly why, but I can't give them five stars.  It's a solid establishment, but it's missing a kick to push me over the hump to five stars.  Solid spot for a meal, though."}
{"text":"What's up, cheesecurds?  Poutine was solidly great - the cheese curds were squeaky, and that's the make-or-break.  Also, I pretty much swam in my mussel broth.  Yums."}
{"text":"Two friends and I went to Park Bruges and ordered a smorgasbord of food.  Seriously, it almost didn't fit on the table.    But alas, let me start at the beginning.  Our wait was short, just enough time to grab a drink at the bar.  I couldn't resist getting a beer off of the extensive list, but my dinner mates each got cocktails (Beer Sangria!!) that were creative and tasty.  The bartender and hostess were very friendly.  We ordered the following (for real, it was just us 3, don't judge):  Tarte Flambee - classic version, the Cheese Board with chorizo, Asian Chicken Skewers, and Moules Frites - Spicy Creole.  For dessert we ordered these three cream puffs with hazelnut deliciousness inside.    My absolute favorite dish was the Moules Frites.  You CAN get great mussels in Pittsburgh!  The Creole version had Maytag bleu cheese that melted in your mouth.  The Frites were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  What a treat.  When I come again I'm getting this allllll for me!  My second favorite was the Cheese Board.  I'm a complete sucker for a good Cheese Board and this one had a great mix of cheeses, including one of my favorites, St. Andre's.    The Skewers and Tarte Flambee were good, although I found the Asian Skewers a bit out of place.  I actually liked the cucumber salad that came with it more than the skewers.  Still wonderfully tender, delicious chicken, though.  The Tarte Flambee was good but it didn't stand out after gorging myself on everything else.    Service was good, waitresses were attentive and friendly.    Best of all, our bill was surprisingly lower than what we were expecting.    I highly recommend Park Bruges...the dinner I had stands out as one of the best I've had so far this year.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Two out of three meals had multiple hairs in them.  You'd think they might comp them all but no such luck.  Long waits for hairy meals.  Won't be going back, that's for sure!  Ew.  Gross"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I am lucky it is only a 6 block walk from home. I have enjoyed literally everything I have tried on the menu. The problem is trying to pass on a favorite to try something new. The popular mussels which come with your choice of 3 sauces (I prefer the basic white wine and butter), the frites (fries), the salads, and even the grilled cheese sandwich.  The Brugge burger is simply the best in the 'burgh. Even the roll is super tasty. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly and help each other out so you are not left looking for your waiter when they get busy."}
{"text":"Did I really never review this place? I've only been here like 9372758274728573 times already haha It's okay, better late than never right? SOLID Four star in terms of food and drinks!  My friends and I came here one time and we truly tested out their drinking menu. Similar to Pointe Brugge, it has a bunch of beer selections. However, my personal favorite is their Moscow mule served in a copper/tin looking glass/mug! It's fun to drink and the taste is very nice and smooth. Not too sweet and easy to sip on. But if you are into beers, they have many other selections. They even have tasty virgin drinks for any pregnant ladies out there!  Onto the food. MUSSELS!! Of course we come here mostly for their mussels. To be completely honest we prefer Pointe Brugge mussels slightly more, but this place is still very good! The only thing is they serve it in one size (1lb I believe)...Pointe Brugge gives a slight more option in terms serving size.   We have also tried their other food as well and it was also very delicious. What they call as their \"small plates\" are by no means small at all! We made the mistake of telling our friends they wouldn't get enough food with two small plates...that resulted in them going home with a bagful of leftovers lol. Their \"flat bread pizza\" or whatever it's called in French is really good, and so was their pork belly! If you like fatty food, must try the pork belly. We ordered a few other entree but I don't remember them all - regardless everyone loved their own food! From appetizers to sandwiches to special entree, everything was good.  I couldn't give this place a five star because 1) mussels are better at their sister restaurant and 2) they don't offer the same Belgian chocolate dessert as their sister restaurant.  But yeah, if you are in the area, go explore!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch ~12 on a Sunday, party of two. We've both worked in the service industry - we aren't a difficult 2-top to have.  The hostess seated a 4-top that arrived after us, before us. Probably wouldn't have noticed if the 2-top hadn't been sitting empty for a good 10 minutes.  Our server poured one glass of water and left the other empty once we sat down. He rarely checked in on us.  It took us a good 20 minutes to get a bloody mary and a mimosa.  During our appetizer our server would check on the tables beside us but barely glanced our way.  Ordered our food 25 minutes later.  Our entrees came out a good 5-10 minutes apart.  The one redeeming thing about the service was that he noticed when our water pitcher was empty.  Even then, it took him 10 minutes to get it refilled.   Basically, our server was awful.  We love the food at Park Bruges and have been here multiple times.  Giving two stars because the food never disappoints.  The service was absolutely terrible for no reason.   They were faster with the check than they were with anything else."}
{"text":"Listen, I love eating locally, and I love eating a value meal (i.e. price and quality match up). PB on the other hand takes the safe route with everything. No seasonal menu. Food is overpriced and mediocre. Atmosphere is dim. Bartender is great, but good drinks can only carry a restaurant so far.   This restaurant is the epitome of being the only \"American / French\" restaurant in a prime walking neighborhood that does everything to be nothing special but lure HP neighbors because of the lack of other sitdown type of restaurants in the area (honestly, AppleWood is better if you just want a burger).  Mussels are eh. Chicken eh, etc. etc. Do something special. Serve good food at a reasonable price. Serve seasonal food that leverages local farms.   If you want to spend $25 on an entree, eat ok mussels, and have expensive good French fries, go to PB."}
{"text":"Park Bruges did not match the hype for me.  I got the Steak Frites.  It was tasty, but I swear I can get the same quality at many other places.  It just seemed ordinary to me."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here but I went when it wasn't very crowded (around 2). Otherwise I wouldn't have liked it nearly as much."}
{"text":"Good moules, good beer. Brought back memories from Belgium, so definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"To start off it's been a while since we've gone to the sister restaurant Point Brugge for brunch but I distinctly remember them having a French toast on the prix fixe before.  I could have guaranteed if they had that this time around at the Park my wife would have ordered that.  Highland Park is different from Point Breeze but it didn't change the fact that there was a little bit of a wait since this place was also very popular as well.  We seemed to be the first in line right after the entire restaurant had been completely seated.  We had a wait but it wasn't that long at all, about 20 minutes or so.  We could have been seated right away at the bar but we preferred to wait for a table.  We had each gone with a prix fixe two of which were the brisket hash and I had the original Benedict (with ham).  I had the Benny with crab cakes last time and it was ok but I just felt like having ham this time around.  The sides were bacon and a cup of yogurt.  The drinks were samosas and one Bloody Mary.  I had ordered a side of Bruges Frites too.  I was pleased with my Eggs Benny.  The ham was very tasty and overall it was a filling brunch.  The bacon here is so good.  It's thick cut and very smoky.  It does not seem like your everyday grocery store bacon at all.    The \"fries\" are very good but very salty.  It's a funny joke my friend and I have about frites vs fries.  Frites are served with some sort of aioli instead of ketchup and because of the name they are more expensive.  This place fit that cliche to a tee.  They are fries... by any other name.  They also have poutine here which to me is funny to see.  Usually nice sit down places that serve mussels don't serve poutine.  Poutine where I come from are a fast food and they are EVERYWHERE and anywhere you can order fries (not frites) the option for poutine is automatic.    Brunch here is nice.  It's sort of expensive but it's a treat.  If you weren't going to have alcohol it would be more realistic... but hey Bloody Mary for brunch.  It's what makes a difference between breakfast and brunch.  Legitimate brunch = cocktail of some sort.  I can now say that both the Park and the Point are legit for that AND they are both good and nice for brunch on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Amazing mussels and service. Went to brunch with a small group on a Sunday and had about a 30 min wait. We all ordered mussels and when the food was relieved, we discovered a hair on of the the plates. This is bound to happen in even the best restaurants and our server immediately took the plate away. Within minutes the manager was at our table with sincere apologies. After our meals, she stated desserts were on the house for everyone.   All of the desserts were amazing, and I will definitely be back to a restaurant that values their customers as much as Park Bruges does"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always leave wondering why I don't come more often. I always get 2 things to when I'm here - the poutine and a pound of mussels (classic white wine sauce).  they serve it with crusty bread that you dip in the sauce -oh man my mouth is watering thinking about it.  This place is great and I swear I'm going to come back more often."}
{"text":"The mussels, the fries, the beer! I love this place. My favorite time to come here is for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday. I love the waffles and eggs benedict. They also have a salad with strawberries and fresh greens when strawberries are in season, which is an absolute must.  The wait staff is always great, and the ambience is peaceful and low key. Definitely a favorite brunch spot in the East End."}
{"text":"I am picky, let that be known.   Park Brugges satisfies my endless craving for mussels much in the same way its sister restaurant does. Situated in the charming business district of Highland Park, Park Brugges is a great place to spend a romantic evening, or get your grub on after work. Roll up those sleeves because moule's can get a bit messy at times if you dive into them with a zeal such as mine.  I imagine they have other fantastic dishes on their menu, I am sure of it. Alas, I doubt I will ever discover it for myself as I am too busy getting lost in a sea of curried moules and crispy frites (mayo!), while the current of Unibroue carries me onward."}
{"text":"Fantastic Nieghboor spot with friendly service and great food. Mussels and Frites are must, but you certainly won't be disappointed with any of the options. It's nice to go with a group to take advantage of sharing several dishes. Brunch, Lunch, or Dinner is always on point!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm for a late lunch. There were few customers in this place. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a coffee. Coffee arrived lukewarm. After waiting for 30 minutes for the chicken sandwich, I paid for the coffee and left. During the time I was seated there, no server came by to ask me and the one who took my order did not bother to check on me. This is the worst service I've ever seen. Will not go back. The menu is very sparse with a few random items. Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 2-3-4 stars.  So, I'll average and go with 3.  Went in on a Saturday night and waited about 45 minutes table for 2.  Not bad.  My main complaint is that it is LOUD.  I mean, put some carpet down or noise tiles up or SOMETHING.  I had to keep asking the person across the table from me \"What?!\"  The food was good, the service was good.  But the #1 thing that won't make me come back is the price.  $19 for a plate of pasta with some boiled shrimp?  Ummm....next time I'll save my dough and go eat at Eleven.  If you like Mussels, maybe this is the place for you.   ...but they're not my thing.  But hey, maybe that's just me being picky and liking quiet restaurants.  If you're into a noisy scene and lots of beer selections, you'll probably like it.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Such great food. I try to be health conscious when eating out (meaning whole grain, real food, and served with fresh fruit and veggies).  At most restaurants I only find two items that are healthy that I would like. Here I was shocked at how many options on the menu qualify ... even whole grain grilled cheese with tomatoes for my child. Things were both healthy and delicious too!  I had a salmon omelet of the day and my hubby had a sausage sandwich with an egg on it. I love eggs, so I think I could eat here every day!  The atmosphere could qualify as romantic or social depending on the time of day.  And there was great art work on the walls giving it a very modern feel, mixing nicely some old looking touches with great art work.    I also drink a lot of water at meals.  I loved that they had a bottle of water in the middle of all tables... and it was a neat bottle... kind of looked like an over sized wine bottle with a top that would go on and off... hey, it's all the finer details!"}
{"text":"Park Brugues is quite an awesome place to stop by if you are looking for a place to relax and have a great conversation with friends/family over late breakfast, lunch...or beck..over dinner. The restaurant is higher end casual...but not a stucked up place..andoffers a variety of drinks that you can have, or even if you don't drink, some great dishes to share as well.  My SO and I shared a cheese board (+chorizo) and moules frites (white wine sauce) and we were really happy with our meals. Although the food portion was big, we were so happy that the meal still felt light and didn't make us feel sluggish after eating a lot of food like we typically get at other restaurants.  Of note..try dipping and asking for extra bread to eat with the white wine sauce that is left over after eating all the mussels in our moules frites...it was divine!! I really loved our meal here!! The prices were also very reasonable. They aren't on the cheap side especially when compared to Pittsburgh establishment...but they are still very reasonable!!  Check it out if you are looking for a place to dining over great conversations with friends and families. I wouldn't mind being back here again for sure despite the fact that I'm not usually a drinker either!"}
{"text":"This place is largely overrated. We waited almost an hour on a Sat evening, got in, sat down, ordered their signature stuff (mussels, flatbread pizza, and a Tuna dish). Waitress was friendly and food came out fast. But nothing was extraordinary: the food as a whole was bland; the mussel meat was quite small and didn't really have any taste; the tuna was probably cooked too much that it was quite floppy. We were full in the end, but it wasn't worth the $40+ per person we paid for, even if it included a very expensively priced beer."}
{"text":"Delish!  Mussels and beer done right and a very nice great prix fixe brunch.  Always has exciting specials.  Don't miss one of their seasonal beer/special dinners!    Even if I didn't live in the neighborhood at a walkable distance, I would go out of my way to get here.  In spite of a decor that reminds me of a nice eat n park, this place always has a lively and fun vibe.  Great staff and bartenders!"}
{"text":"Park Bruges has been on my brunch to-do list for some time.  I was meeting a friend on Sunday morning hoping to bribe her into being my petsitter with a great meal on a beautiful day.  Park Bruges did the trick.  I was expecting a wait of around 30 minutes minimum given our prime brunch time arrival (just before 1pm) but since this particular Sunday was the running of the Pittsburgh Marathon and Bryant Street was part of the route, we only waited minutes for the hostess to clean off one of the outside tables.  It was a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we enjoyed the weather and rooting on the final runners as we dined.  When I went inside to ask the hostess about sitting outside, I saw the daily beer bottle special was Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout.  I ordered one as soon as we were seated and greeted by our friendly and personable waitress.  Deciding on food was a bit more difficult.  Everything sounded delicious and I had been looking over the menu online the day before but still couldn't make up my mind.  After our waitress approached us for the third time, I went with my gut and ordered the Open Faced BLT and a side of Bruges Frites.  My dining partner went with the prix fixe brunch option of Beef Brisket Potato Hash, Granola and yogurt, and Mimosa.    The beautifully structured creation of maple-bourbon house cured bacon, sunnyside up eggs, tomato, and arugula on ciabatta drizzled with smoked paprika aioli makes you remember why brunch exists.  Those frites with roasted garlic dijon mayo didn't hurt, either.  If I wasn't such a lady, I may have also devoured my friend's main course.  That beef brisket potato hash is made with gouda and horseradish sauce topped with sunnyside up eggs.  It should be no surprise that when our waitress asked if we wanted dessert and we didn't really answer yes or no, we opted for a delicious chocolate cake (I think she mentioned something about Bailey's when she explained the dessert options) to end a perfect meal.  I could not have imagined a more perfect day.  The only reason I deducted one star is because I felt the brunch was a little pricey.  Our two meals (with drinks and dessert) came to $65.  I don't mind a splurge every once in awhile and on this particular day it felt worth it."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Point Bruge cafe I wanted to try the Park Bruges cafe as well. The food was nice but you can clearly see the difference in the environment, the atmosphere and the food. Park Bruges is larger than point bruges but less cozy and \"familish\". Food is still of great quality even though for example the great basil mayo sauce was now simply mayo a d the fries seemed more like precooked ones. In general though it is a great choice for food definitely."}
{"text":"As we walked to the car and began to get in, my H held the door open as I rolled in.  He closes the door and gets in the driver side, when I state \"better hurry to the hospital the baby is coming.  Let's call her Mussels.\"  I had done it again.  Ate until I was so stuffed it was unpleasant, but if you asked me if I regret it I will say \"nope!\"  I do get overzealous when it comes a new place that I haven't been to, all I want to do is try everything that looks good without regard to my personal wellbeing.   So the food, we ordered a classic poutine, the Bruges Burger prepared medium, a LB of mussels spicy prepped, and a few drinks.  I explained to the H that the Poutine was his but I wanted to try it thus making him the main consumer so I wouldn't eat too many.  Well that didn't work as planned.  Upon delivery I fork dived in and got a huge amount of fries, curds, and gravy.  Simply divine!   He got the burger to which I had to try.  Really very good, and I ate his side salad, lovely dressing.  My mussels were very creamy and brothy I simply loved them but felt something was left off.  The bartender offered extra bread to sop up extra juices that I gladly accepted.     Now this is a shame to say about what should be a 5 star place.  The restaurant was just confusing.  You walk in and there is no hostess there.  No sign saying please wait to be seated, no just people loitering around I was like what are we supposed to do???  So there is a small bar real close to the door so with the fear of waiting forever we seized the two open seats and decided to just eat there.  Bar has no TV, and the Bartender was as slow as molasses. Absolutely no sense of urgency.  She was nice, and knowledgeable if you could get her attention.   The food was EXCELLENT!  But I am upset that I ordered the spicy mussels and thought the whole time these are not spicy... Very good but not spicy.  My H kept saying it was probably b/c I always like stuff extra spicy and have a high tolerance.  I kept saying no my mom who can't eat anything with spice would eat this no problem.  But having never been there I thought it was just how they served it.  That was until the check came.  Another episode of a bartender not writing down an order and rang me in for the classic and not the spicy.  A little too late to complain and they were really good still but, I really wanted the spicy ones!  So the service was meh.  It took her 10 minutes to even wait on us because she had one speed, the I don't give a sh*t speed.  Still would totally come back!  Those mussels were to die for and next time I will know what to expect if I get the wrong ones."}
{"text":"Park Bruges, what a spot! Easily the best mussels in the city of Pittsburgh. I always rant and rave about them! Winter is the best time to go get those mussels because that's when they are in season so they are that much better. Also the French fries are to die for. Double fried shoestring French fries they are always perfectly cooked. They also have a great selection of Belgium beers as well. The place never disappoints! Enjoy."}
{"text":"After a splendid meal here, it's time to update my review. The coveted 5 stars goes to one of the best cheese plates in town, amazing food and exceptional service. Park Bruges specializes in Belgian  beers, and they are well known for their mussels. But there's a lot more here to appreciate, including consistently great food and a friendly neighborhood vibe that will keep you coming back. Same owners as the popular Point Breeze location, but a larger establishment with shorter lines.   We tried the Flemish onion soup, and it is extraordinarily satisfying. I had the Shrimp and Grits, which was prepared with Southern authenticity.   Top it off with friendly and knowledgeable service and you have a real winner."}
{"text":"We've been there only for brunch on weekends, so I can't say nothing about week days. Expect to wait in the line specially in the lunch \"rush hour\". Food tastes good, have good presentation and portions are enough. In my opinion the price is a little bit more than average (compared to other brunches restaurants) but it because the place and meal are better. I just think could have more healthy options in the menu."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this spin off of the Point Bruges restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.   I recommend both the dinner menu and the brunch/lunch menu. Both the dinner and brunch dishes were excellent. The hostess was very pleasant, my brunch wait person was not. The Point Bruges is exceptional too! You can't go wrong at either location."}
{"text":"Mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels mussels,  mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels mussels...sigh...  Mussels, Mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, Mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels, mussels mussels...  I mean, seriously, the mussels...just thinking about them makes my mouth water. Now, obviously, I'm a BIG fan of mussels, and I've eaten a lot of good mussels in a lot of good places, but nothing compares. They are known for their mussels, and everyone says to go for their mussels...yea, yea - but no, really, go for their mussels.  I had visited their sister company quite some time ago, Point Bruges - and ever since have been itching to visit this place. The mussels and everything we had at Point was amazing.   While mostly positive things come to mind when thinking of this restaurant...my mussels and frites were - beyond delicious. However,my friends pasta meal came out...luke warm...so there's that. We were having a very late lunch (senior citizen style dinner), so there weren't many in the restaurant. We were at a two top - and the service was great - attentive and seemed genuinely interested - but after our plates were cleared, I was still finishing a glass of wine, and we began to feel rushed. The waitress coming over multiple times (glass of wine still half full) looking for the payment for the check that she gave us. I looked behind us and saw that the dinner rush was beginning, there were quite a few people waiting for a table at this point. The table next to us - another two top - was empty - so I knew we were getting the feeling of being rushed because they were going to combine our two with that two to make a four top - low and behold - as soon as we stood, that happened. Well, such is life - for a restaurant who doesn't take reservations - they must turn tables quickly. There was another incident with a toddlers squeaky shoes (I mean these shoes were purposefully squeaky as though they had a dog toy in them) who walked around the restaurant for a bit too long - but I can imagine management was probably stuck between a rock and hard place with that one.  All in all though, very satisfied. Great place to go...not sure why, but feels very Pittsburgh to me. Very really good eats Pittsburgh.  And you must try the mussels ;-)"}
{"text":"Park Brugge is amazing. I love their brunch. The burger is very very good. Their specials are always fresh. I treated myself to the crab cake Benedict which was incredible. We live so close and are frequent customers. Make sure you check out their specials because the fried green tomatoes open BLT dish was fantastic."}
{"text":"I brunch a lot. I am serious about brunch and having moved to pgh from phl I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find some great brunch places to fill the void. Luckily one of the first places I stumbled upon (with the help of google maps and yelp reviews) was Park Bruges. Situated on Bryant Street in Highland Park, they were right around the corner from where I stayed the first time I visited Pittsburgh. I feel pretty lucky to have this place be one of the first restaurants I've tried because it is so darned good.   This is a Saturday and Sunday brunch place which is super important to me, the idea that you can only brunch on Sunday is something that Pittsburgh has GOT TO STOP. It's the weekend? you should be able to brunch. End of story.  Their brunch menu is pretty big with lots of options if you're indecisive. They even have a prix fix option where you get a brunch beverages, brunch meal, and a side dish. I'm a big fan of their eggs benedict, steak and eggs, and brunch poutine (so decadent, and delicious).   If you show up at a few minutes before 11am (when they open) there is a line to get in, but if you are in that line you are usually sat immediately at 11 which makes it a great way to be sure you can get in. I also like coming up here because of their proximity to E2 and tazzadora (in case the wait is too long I like options!)  I've also recently had dinner here and I can admit that I was just as happy with that meal as I was with brunch (except that brunch is the best meal of the day and therefore trumps all other meals in my book regardless of how good they are).   Overall, it's fair to say that I'm a fan and will continue to be a fan so long as they continue to feed me delicious brunch foods and cocktails."}
{"text":"My friend, A, and I went to brunch here.  I have been to Point Bruges several times and know that if you want to go to brunch and don't want to wait in line you get there early.  We arrived at 10:30 for an 11 am open.  We were not the only ones.  Standing about 4th in line, we were sat within minutes of opening and had waters and some of the best coffee I have ever had within a few minutes more.    A and I like to think that we are brunch professionals having sampled quite a few in the city, so we knew that we should try something varied in order to share.  She ordered the omelette of the day which was prosciutto, asparagus and goat cheese with fresh fruit.  The salty meat and savory vegetables melded perfectly with the creamy goat cheese.  The eggs were cooked to perfection with just enough crisp on the edges.  Slices of cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon surrounded a pile of strawberries and grapes.  All of the fruit was perfectly ripe.    I ordered the brunch-style Poutine.  When eating out, go big or go home.  The massive pile of double-fried fries was covered with 2 fried eggs - again perfectly cooked.  These people know their eggs.  Scattered throughout the pile were local cheese curds.  Having a lot of friends from Wisconsin, I like to think that I know my cheese curds.  They need to squeak if they are good - and these squeaked away.  A surprising treat was the homemade maple-apple sausage.  Real apples, definitely real maple syrup and delicious pork made up the sausage.  The fries were definitely more than I could handle, but A was happy to help.  For me, brunch would not be complete with a Bloody Mary and this was a serious Bloody Mary - no pre-made, store-bought mix here.  Absolute love.    All in all, this has to be one of the best brunches in the city.  I look forward to coming back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Had  a wonderful birthday dinner here last Saturday night.  The atmosphere is of a neighborhood bistro.  Easy-going and unpretentious with many repeat customers. Dress code would be \"come as you are and just enjoy.\"  We arrived around 6pm and, although the restaurant was quickly filling up, we were able to be seated right away, as we were just a party of two.  The traditional Moules Frites was heavenly and, thankfully, I was offered additional fresh baguette so that I could enjoy that wonderful sauce. I understood quickly why I was given a spoon.  My husband had the Steak Frites and he enjoyed every morsel.  We ended the meal with a delicious piece of Tarte Tatin with a wonderful crust and truly fabulous caramel sauce.  Our server was lovely and helpful and helped us choose the right Belgian beer to go with our meals.    The only thing I want to note is that the last time we were here was almost a year ago and I pointed out that there was no baby changing table in the restroom.  We did not have our now-toddler with us this time around, but I noticed that there was still no changing table in the restroom. Certainly, it's not the most sightly item to decorate the wall of a bathroom, but I'm sure it would be a welcome convenience for the many families who frequent this place."}
{"text":"I ended up stopping at this restaurant this past weekend for brunch with companion.  Having been here and to the sister restaurant before I once again held high hopes and was not disappointed.  The decor of the restaurant is nice with a lot of open space and seating which is good since it  seems to fill up quickly.  We arrived at 11, their opening time, on a Sunday and within a few minutes the restaurant was almost full.  By the time that we left almost an hour later there was a fairly big wait for a time.  For brunch I ended up ordering the omelet of the day which had barbeque pulled pork, jalepeno cheddar cheese and onion.  Now that may sound a little weird but It was easily one of the best omelets that I have ever tasted in my life.  The BBQ sauce was of the Carolina variety, so a bit vinegary which fit perfectly against the spiciness of the cheese.  By the end I felt like I had almost eaten a very good pulled pork sandwich which in my opinion is perfect for brunch.  My dining companion ended up getting the tarte flambee.  It was a very interesting dish that almost ended looking like a flat bread pizza but was also very tasty.  The bottom line for me is that the food was fantastic and I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the voice of dissent, but based on the glowing reviews and price, I was a bit underwhelmed by the brunch here.  I was actually planning to go to E2 for brunch on Sun., but my dining partner and I ended up here because the wait at E2 was running an hour at noon.  Here, we were seated within half an hour, which I appreciated, given the hectic nature of the PGH brunch scene.  I ordered the prix fixe brunch with the special of the day (pulled pork, cheddar, and onion omelette), potatoes au gratin, and a mimosa ($20).  I chose the special because I'm a BBQ aficionado, and I love me some pulled pork.  Between the pulled pork and cheddar, I expected the omelette to be bursting with flavor, but I found it rather bland.  I was also disappointed with the amount of pork in the omelette, which seemed rather stingy.  While I liked the flakiness of the potatoes (they were more akin to a casserole), I also found them bland, flavor-wise.  The part of the meal I enjoyed most was the mimosa, but to be honest, I don't have a standard of comparison, since this was my first time drinking one.  My dining partner enjoyed his grilled cheese, although it wasn't quite what he was expecting (he was expecting your standard grilled cheese).  While this wasn't a bad brunch, I doubt that I'd come out of my way to have it again, given that there are so many awesome brunch places in PGH.  For a similar quality brunch, I could have gone to Pamela's or DeLuca's, or gotten something more unique at at E2 or Coca (and paid less, to boot!).  If I were to come back here or to try Point Brugge, I think I'd stick to dinner so I could try the mussels and frites, since that's what everyone seems to rave about.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear that they opened a sister restaurant to Point Brugge Café in a location that was more convenient to me.  This location is definitely spacier and more open than the one in Point Breeze.  The service is great.  Many of the service staff from Point Brugge work at Park Bruges.  The no-reservations rule still apply here and the wait is the same.  The style of the menu is similar but of course with different plates.  The food was good, but I would still prefer the cuisine at the older location. The frites are 10x better at Point Brugge than here.  Here, they are thinner cut fries and not as crunchy.  I had the Red Wine Braised Shortribs for dinner and though  it's good, but I didn't want to lick my plate clean like I normally do when I visit Point Brugge.  The moules are the same here.  One thing I really didn't like were the desserts, especially the souffle.  When you think chocolate souffle, you think of a fluffy and light pastry in a white ramekin hot from the oven seconds from being baked.  I anticipated getting this and digging my spoon into it and watching the pastry collapse into itself revealing the yummy goodness inside.  Well... It is a crime that here, they call their dessert a souffle.  It was more like a flourless chocolate cake.  There's nothing wrong with that, just don't call it something that it clearly isn't!  Disappointing!  The ambiance here is also different. Point Brugge is certainly livelier and more cozy, but I guess this place is more for bigger groups or families or if you prefer to be more than an arm's length from your fellow patrons.  All in all, a decent place to eat, but if I had to pick between the two Belgian restaurants in town, this wouldn't be it.  However, I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by many of my friends, and I finally get a chance to try. Indeed, the visit turned out to be a good experience. The mussel, available in three kinds of sauces, was as good as the reputation. There aren't many choices available on menu though. Among all the restaurants in Highland Park, Park Bruges is quite popular and was crowded on weekend, and reservation is not available."}
{"text":"First night of serving on Friday night!  My wife and I happened to drive by and noticed the front window jammed with people waiting for tables.  After months (more than a year?) of delays, the sister restaurant to the legendary Point Brugge Cafe (Point Breeze) has finally opened.  Grand opening on Tuesday 1 February, but a \"soft opening\" was announced to the Highland Park neighbors earlier this week.  As you might expect if you've ever seen the reviews of Point Brugge Cafe, Pittsburgh now has another terrific fresh-food restaurant!  And another feather in the restaurant cap for Bryant Street and Highland Park.  The decor is contemporary -- sleek and simple -- but very comfortable.  It's a boisterous place (some might call it \"noisy\") so if you're looking for dark, quiet, romantic dinner, this ain't the place for you.  If, however, you're looking for great food in an energized environment, this could your new dining \"home.\"    I wish I could offer a more extended sense of the menu, but my wife and I both ordered the same thing.    We started with a potato/pancetta soup.  It was broth-based, but with just a touch of cream to hold it together.  Light and delicious.  Our entree: herb-crusted salmon over arugula and lentils.  In spite of the fact that we ordered the salmon well-done (not fans of raw fish), the salmon was moist and tasty.   The arugula and lentils were wonderful.    For dessert, we shared an order of profiteroles: three crisp, hollow rounds of pastries filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate and, I believe, a bit of caramel.  Again, very flavorful.   Not a fan of chocolate, but whatever they drizzled on the profiteroles was particularly tasty.  For fans of Point Brugge, the menu includes the steamed P.E.I. mussels and Belgain-style twice-cooked fries with seasoned mayonnaise.  (The family at the table next to us went through two orders of EACH!)  The service was very good even though it was the first night with customers.  I was told that the cafe hired EXPERIENCED servers, host staff and bartenders.  Congrats to them for thinking through this.    To repeat: another tremendous addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and ESPECIALLY to fans of good, fresh food who live in the East End.  My only disappointment was that I couldn't get an espresso after dinner.  Only traditional American coffee (though it IS PrestoGeorge coffee).  No big deal, though, as I can always wander around the corner to Tazza d'Oro on Highland Avenue.  I didn't pick up the phone number or find a Website for the place.  I hope that other Yelpers can supplement this soon."}
{"text":"I love seeing all these quality spots coming to Highland Park. As the neighborhood I grew up in, HP has always been a great area, but spots like Park Bruges are really making it a destination.  I stopped in for brunch and was pleased to see a brunch menu with varied choices as well as a prefix option.  Like it's sister location, Park B offers great food, great service and a great atmosphere - Pretty much all you could want in a neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and no TV, no annoying sports or commercials. Just nice people actually talking to one another."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Our entire group loved it.  Green chili mussels, poutine, baked ckn and onion soup- awesome."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friends on Sunday. The restaurant itself wasn't too crowded, we called ahead to make sure the wait isn't too long. We only had to wait for about five minutes when we got there.  I think the food here is either a hit or miss. My friends and I ordered mussels and fries to share, and I ordered a vegetable frittata for myself. We ordered the classic white wine sauce for mussels and it was good as expected. The baguette that came with the mussels were a bit tough, but it wasn't rock hard. The fries are also delicious; however, compared to the fries at Point Brugge where the fries are short and stout, these are longer and thinner. The vegetable frittata of the day was roasted eggplants, tomatoes, feta cheese, and arugula pesto. The frittata itself was kind of a disappointment. It was very bland, and wasn't all that great. I won't try it again.  Other than the frittata, everything else was great."}
{"text":"This place never ever disappoints.  The onion soup is the best I've ever had.  The summer salad tonight has pickled blueberries! We split the low country boil mussels this time and it was amazing. The staff is so friendly and attentive.  You must try."}
{"text":"What's not to like? It's Pittsburgh, Belgian style.   You like fries and beer? How about poutine and a Belgian beer? Maybe even a tasty plate of muscles."}
{"text":"I came here for an early Sunday dinner around 430pm. It got busy quickly- Pitt's graduation had just let out- but even once all the tables were filled, the service didn't waiver. It did get a bit loud, but it's a smallish room.  We got a couple of beers (great selection) and the Classic Montreal Poutine to start- came out right away. I got the Shortrib Pasta- huge portion, great taste (maybe needed a bit of salt) and reasonably priced. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  We finished with the Salted Caramel Brownie Cheesecake. It was pretty small- as the server warned us- but it was very rich and definitely worth it. I would certainly recommend Park Bruges and I look forward to checking out its sister restaurant in Point Breeze."}
{"text":"Simply excellent an awesome Pittsburgh restaurant! Their brunch is excellent. Try the fries OMG! The portions are generous and the service is great. You may have to wait :). It's worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant tops all categories: fresh, inspiring food- relaxed, cozy environment- and prices are reasonable!  On the weekends they have Brunch which is amazing! The grilled cheese is definitely not your ordinary! It's worth the trip, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in the area and stumbled on this little gem.  I know we were hungry and food always tastes better when you're hungry but the desserts were super duper yummy.  We ordered the Vegetable Frittata and Pork Belly... we enjoyed it all.  Then for dessert I ordered the profiteroles, my dad the chocolate souffle and my mom the Tarte Tatin.  We all agreed these desserts were phenomenal and we were so happy to have found this restaurant especially since we are tourists in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food, drinks and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"*Homer Simpson drooling sound*   Park Bruges is a total success!  The space is wonderful & inviting.  The layout is nice and open, and it seems like there's more tables than at Point Brugge.  We were told a 45 minute wait on Saturday night, but didn't wait for more than 20 - 30 minutes.  The dress ranged from very casual to a little dressy.  The hostess and waitstaff were all efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable.    The beer selection is ample and varied, with many high ABV options.  There's about 5 beers on tap, and too many bottles to count.  I had a Three Philosophers quadrupel, and my friends had a brown ale from local Full Pint Brewing Co and a Ephemere lambic from Unibroue.  Our beers ranged from about $6.00 - $7.50.  The food was spot-on.  We started with the Classic Montreal Poutine.  The gravy was more of a chicken gravy, which surprised me and others who'd had poutine before, but it was still delicious.  We continued with the Moules-- one classic and one with andouille sausage and bleu cheese.  Both were delicious, though the flavors in the latter are more robust than the light white white/herb sauce.  The moules didn't come out with any bread, which was disappointing, but I'm sure you could ask for some.  I had the sea scallop fettuccine.  Ample sea scallops perfectly seared with a light-ish sauce and large green and red peppers.  We were all too stuffed for dessert, but I might try their chocolate martini next time!  Also, I think on my next visit I'll do more of a small plates/family style dinner rather than order entrees.  I love that I have the 2 dining options at one establishment.  Little trivia: They used the Flemish spelling for Point Brugge and the French spelling for Park Bruges since both are spoken in Belgium!"}
{"text":"We decided upon Park Bruge for brunch. I have read so many wonderful reviews of the place. We arrived and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It was packed. Leszek ordered a bloody mary. I watched the bartender make it...he was very generous with the Absolute vodka. I ordered a California red wine.  Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgable, a bit frumpy, apparently you can wear whatever you want to work, but why not dress up a bit? I ordered Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Potato Hash sunny side up eggs, gouda cheese, horseradish sauce. $14 I also got a side of Creamy Polenta figs & candied walnuts. Cup $3.50 Leszek ordered Classic Steak & Eggs sunny side up eggs, horseradish cream, Bruges frites. $17  The side of polenta arrived before my meal. It was very good but only one very small piece of fig in the bottom. I was looking forward to more figs, so I was disappointed.  My entree arrived and I was very surprised at the minimal amount of beef brisket, it couldn't even have have been 2 ounces, again disappointed. The potato hash was good, fresh and from fresh potatoes, not freeze dried. The brunch comes with a chunk of baguette as well, its crusty and hard. No jam or butter.   Leszek's steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was beyond rare. He was okay with that but was not happy that it was so tuff. The waitress never checked back so he just ate it.....very slowly. If you are going to charge 17$, check back, make sure it is cooked the way the guest ordered it and make sure it is desirable.  I am not sure if we will return. For such a popular place, there should be a little more love in the food."}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I went here for brunch. It is a fairly small restaurant, but their brunch menu was quite yummy. We ended up waiting around 45 minutes, but it ended up being worth it. A little pricey - but great for an occasional much-needed girls' brunch!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite brunch in town!     Today's selection was the waffle with fruit topping.  The topping changes seasonally - this version was an amazing blueberry ginger, which paired great with two perfectly cooked Belgian waffles.   I did it prix fix brunch style, with a side of potato gratin and a bloody mary for $20.  The potato could have been warmer, but it was so rich and tasty that I didn't even care.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, but gotta say that the waffles are going to be really hard to beat."}
{"text":"Tried this for Sunday brunch and wow, am I glad I did! It was terrific. Great little place with a nice comfortable atmosphere. Food was creative, fresh and quite tasty. I had several possible choices that made my mouth water but ended up selecting the Eggs Benedict with rosemary Parma ham with a chive hollandaise sauce. It was so good!! Eggs cooked perfectly, the sauce was filled with fresh chive flavor and was a fabulous accompaniment. My wife ordered the green curry mussels and the bowl was a rich bath of spicy broth and a generous serving of delightful mussels. I consider myself a mussels expert and order them whenever I get a chance and was SO happy to sample hers. Repeatedly! They were among the best I've ever had. The sauce was a delightful blend of curry spice with the distinct flavors of cilantro and basil. Yum. I wanted to stick my face in that bowl and lick it clean. Instead, we asked for extra bread and did it in a more civilized manner! But wow, was it ever good. The vegetable fritatta was really good and the baked eggs Diablo hit nearly every possible note you'd want in a breakfast entree - marinara, banana peppers, capers, and olives. I mean, what could be bad about that? It was super tasty. And oh yeah, those Bruge frites? Awesome. And yes, they ARE suitable for breakfast! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The vegetable linguine with salmon was amazing. Also there french fries with gravy are excellent. They also have a great wine and beer list. We have always had superb service."}
{"text":"Are you in Pittsburgh? Somewhere in the East End? Is it lunch time?   Get yourself to Park Bruges. Subjectively, they have my favorite burger in all of the Burgh. The burger is always perfectly done and the bread is fresh, with a perfect crust. Everything above and beyond that just makes it all the better.   Though the draft list is small, their bottle selection is substantial and varied. They have great wines available and the atmosphere is vibrant -- for lunch or dinner.   Going for dinner? Get there early or get ready to wait."}
{"text":"Park Bruges is a cute restaurant located in Highland Park.  I went there for brunch and was a little disappointed based on the hype. First, the service wasn't great. Our server was rarely available. We waited a long time for drinks; so long that we saw the bartender make herself a drink and take a few swigs while we were waiting for ours. The mimosas were good according to my friends, but the bloody mary I had was terrible. It was excessively salty and peppery.  The food itself is great. I had a brunch poutine that was amazing. The cheese curds, egg, sausage gravy, and fries all worked very well together. Everyone else enjoyed their food too, except for the potatoes gratin, which were undercooked.  In summary, the food was great, but the service and drinks make me question how quickly I'll go back."}
{"text":"Yeah for fries and beer!  Met some friends for a casual lunch and was very impressed with the Belgium beer selection!  The grilled cheese is buttery, melty delicious and I couldn't stop myself from finishing it!  The fries are crisp and salty....everything I want in a french fry! It was a perfect combo of cold beer and salty comfort food!  (My finace got the mussels, which he still dreams about!  Yep that good!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with my friend. Surprisingly, there was a line even before it opened at 11 AM. We were seated immediately. The food was great and our waiter was attentive. Definitely come early as it gets crowded.   We ordered the waffles with seasonal fruit (strawberry and mango) and the classic white wine mussels. The waffles weren't that big in size but it was a good portion. The fruits were delicious and fresh! Hands down, this place has one of the best mussels dishes. It was delicious that you could even just drink the broth! Order the mussels! You won't regret it! (Unless you don't like mussels). The food is good but it's definitely a bit pricey for the quantity."}
{"text":"We were seeking a brunch/lunch spot today when we were running some errands and decided to try Park Brugge (since we love Point Brugge).  Cannot say I was disappointed here either.   Like always, the Mussels were amazing (we always go with the classic wine sauce), service was super attentive and fast, and the food was yummy.  Even though I wanted something not on the brunch menu, they made it for me no questions asked!  The space was larger, more open, and you were not right on top of anyone either... this was great.    Happy to have another option when I am having my amazing mussels craving.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch. Ordered the Crab cakes Benedict and a Bloody Mary. The food arrived super fast and was very tasty."}
{"text":"I yelped thos restaurant and am glad i did! Otherwise i wpuld have never came. Now this is going to b my new sinday brunch spot. Great food. Loved how they took there time to decorate the plate with food. I brought my kids here and they ate every single bite. I had the crabcakes! Very good. I hoghly reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to their sister restaurant (Point Brugge) before and been really pleased and this was no exception.   It's a little out of the way from where I live and in the middle of a residential area but worth the effort to make a trip here.  This restaurant is a little larger than Point Brugge so I would anticipate a shorter wait.  The staff were really accommodating.  We had a very large group and after requesting a table for 8 to 10, we ended up with 14 people.   They made extra efforts to get everyone seats at our table and making sure we were accommodated.  With a group that large, I anticipated slow service and the food did take a while to come out and drink requests and refills were slow.  I imagine the service is much more personal and quicker for smaller groups.    I split the dinner moules frites (mussels and frites) in the spicy creole sauce with someone.   The sauce was nice and spicy and had great flavor.   It was great for dipping the bread they provide (which is a little on the crusty side) and gave a nice taste to the mussels.   With a lb and half of mussels, bread and fries, this dish was perfect for sharing.  They also have a good beer and wine selection and a nice bar area to sit at while waiting."}
{"text":"I like this location more than Point Brugge, because they have essentially the same menu but with less of a crowd. The mussels in white wine sauce are to die for, and they keep us coming back, but some of the other dishes are not as great. The roast chicken is delicious (beware: takes half an hour to prepare!), but the sauteed chicken breast is pretty much tomatoes with a side of tomatoes. I couldn't take more than a few bites before getting overwhelmed. So if you want the best thing on the menu, order the mussels in white wine sauce.  The service here, like at Point Brugge, is consistently very bad. I've had to wander around looking for the seating host/ess multiple times, and usually end up asking the bartender to point him/her out to me. Once we're seated, the waiter typically shows up once to get drinks, and if we don't order our food then, we will have to flag them down 15 minutes later--which is an ordeal in itself, as they are mysteriously out of sight 60% of the time, and chatting with other customers 30% of the time. I've seriously sat and watched our waiter have 15-minute long conversations about the weather with a customer at another table while we wait to ask for more water.  Anyway, we've come back here many times, which must mean that the great food is worth sacrificing service for."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a while back and forgot to review. Food was amazing. Literally the best bacon my gf and I have ever had. Was super thick and smoky tasting and perfectly cooked. The eggs Benedict was super good too. Can't go wrong here. Drinks were great too"}
{"text":"Point Brugge is by far my most-visited restaurant in the city, so obviously I can't not like its sister, Park Bruges. I have eaten here twice now, and while it's not as crowded (major plus), I still prefer the original in Point Breeze.  The menu is very similar (almost a little too similar) to that at Point Brugge. A notable addition is the tarte flambée, a French-style flatbread. Very good (I got the classic preparation, with ham, caramelized onions, and crème fraiche) but nothing mind-blowing. I'd get it again if I was sharing with a group, but I wouldn't find myself craving it. They also have poutine, which I have yet to try, but the frites with roasted garlic aioli were just as good as their Point Brugge counterpart. I actually think I may prefer the aioli to the basil mayo!  As for the mussels, which are always a must, I had to try the new preparation with Maytag Bleu and Andouille Sausage. Again, liked it, but mind wasn't blown. Same goes for the macaroni gratin--Point Brugge just does it better. For those who live in Highland Park, this is a great addition to the neighborhood. As for me, I can't say I'll be abandoning my favorite spot to eat anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch after having been wowed a few weeks ago by Point Brugge Cafe. We arrived around 1 pm and there was a bit of a wait. It's Sunday, no big deal. After about 10 minutes we were escorted to our adorable mosaic tile table and handed a brunch menu. I wasn't expecting to have to order brunch since it was a little later, but there were lots of appetizing looking choices.  I wanted to try the frites, as I had read the reviews and you Yelpers consistently recommend them. We ordered some for the table as a started. They did not disappoint. I've never had frites that were that addictive! I think I stopped talking the moment they arrived, and didn't come up for air until they were gone. So perfectly delicious and the garlic dijion mayo was a perfect pairing for dipping...and I don't even like mayo! I ordered the Vegetable frittata of the day, which had Gouda, carmelized onions, tomatoes, and a heavenly pesto sauce. It was really tasty and fresh, and served with chilled fruit which was a nice light touch. I don't think I've ever had a better frittata. It was perfectly cooked and the quality of ingredients was apparent. My wife ordered the eggs diablo, which I obviously sampled. I really loved the sauce, but I'm not a huge fan of banana peppers so it wouldn't be something I would order. There were a few veggie friendly choices on the menu, so we had more than one option when choosing our lunch/brunch. The other folks at our table got meaty type dishes and raved about them.  The restaurant itself, like it's sister location, is adorable. It's a place where you instantly feel comfortable and you just know a special dining experience is awaiting you. I'm excited to come back and try that incredible looking banana nut french toast. And to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"We headed to Park Bruges on a Sunday for brunch and this place was packed. Luckily a couple of people changed their plans and didn't show up for a reservation so we were quickly seated. The staff was amazing and friendly and also explained their brunch offers for the day. All the food that came out looked and smelled amazing.   I opted for the Prix Fixe Brunch Option and chose the open BLT sandwich with maple-bourbon house cured bacon, the potato gratin as a side and and the house mimosa! The mimosa, delicious and so refreshing; the potato gratin was absolutely amazing and I am sad I couldn't finish it all!   The open BLT sandwich was really good too, the flavor combinations were fantastic, I loved loved loved the smoked paprika aioli, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the bacon! I have never had maple-bourbon cured bacon and was excited to try. But, unfortunately the bacon was really dry and chewy and did not have much taste to it! So I didn't finish it. Even though the bacon should have been the highlight of the dish, I still didn't miss it too much as all the rest of the flavors were really good. I would definitely give them another try as I loved not only the atmosphere but the presentation of the food, the friendliness of the staff and the overall feel to this place."}
{"text":"Waiter was awesome and food was great. This restaurant wasn't too busy and street parking was easily found. The fresh, warm zeppoles are a must-eat!"}
{"text":"Been here a zillion times. Onion soup is a must. Poutine divine. Burgers amazing. Once had muscles mid winter that didn't smell so great. But I could tell the broth was amazing, and the bread too. One adorable red headed bartender  is a doll, he really is. Some of the other staff, including manager type dude, come off a little snobby. They might ignore you if you're not in the industry.  But whatever it's mostly delish"}
{"text":"It's a quaint clean little place. Staff was nice, specifically Abby from the bar, which is where we ended up sitting because they were busy for their brunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was a bit taken back by the menu since to be honest it wasn't untill then we realized we were definitely not in the burger place we thought we were. (apparently there used to be a burger joint across the street but it is now something else) The only burger was a lamb burger and yeah.. no thanks.. the only things to me that seemed somewhat appealing were the \"grilled cheese meal\" and \"mac & cheese meal\". So I ordered the grill cheese and hubby had the mac... everyhting to this point was good, and even though the menu was certainly not our cup of tea, we could have lived with it and who knows maybe if we saw their regular menu instead of the brunch, we may have had a diffent opinion ... But then the food came. .  My grilled cheese was about the size it would be  if you made a grilled cheese out of piece of bread for  bruschetta. With a side of some interesting coleslaw. The mac and cheese looked better and thats about where the enjoyment stopped. The mac & cheese tasted really old or just made really cheaply and someone mixed in some pepperoncini juice. If we were at some kind of dive bar and thd food was super cheap, we wouldnt have been surprised but we weren't. The bartender was super nice,  even though we didn't really complain except when I asked if this was the normal size of the grilled cheese and she replied yes!  Either way considering what you pay, in our opinion its not worth it."}
{"text":"Darren brought me here a few weeks ago, and I liked the mussels but not as much as the mussels I've had at other restaurants. But their frites are some of the very best anywhere. My chocolate souffle was also divine."}
{"text":"Sister to Point Brugge on Hastings Street. I came here for brunch with my family. Good brunch items, but some dishes were hits and some were misses.   I ordered the prosciutto and tomato sandwich. Decent sandwich. The tomatoes are sundried. Bread was a bit soggy. My brother ordered the leige waffles. For the record, they don't compare to Waffalonia's. The ones here were really dry. At that time, they also had this strawberry, chocolate french toast that were also extremely dry.  Still, this probably is a good brunch place. You just need to order the right things. Next time, will definitely order the mussels, poutine, and mac & cheese. Seems like it's what they do best."}
{"text":"I was blown away!!! I don't know how a simple salad could be so delicious! Very cool atmosphere, great service, and salad/ bread were out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Mussels. Beer. We love this place! I prefer the classic style of moules, my partner is into the spicy ones. We share bites and both mmmmm through the meal. Last time we got the ham tarte and oh my gosh was it good. The frites are so crispy salty perfect and even more amazing with the creamy aioli. Love this place.   The brunch is so good too! Have only been once or twice and both times we loved it. The ham benedict did not disappoint and the poutine is yummy."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner this past weekend and was a bit less impressed.  The moules frites left me extremely satisfied and were quite tasty.  My glass of wine was a measly 3-4 oz.  Seriously?  I easily paid for your cost of the bottle of wine in one glass... you can spare another ounce or two.. geez.  Also, my partner got the southwest veggie burger.  The texture was pretty mushy and sad and the poblano pepper was unseeded and EXTREMELY HOT.  To the point of inedible.  When we mentioned this to the server she just kind of shrugged her shoulders, did not offer to send it back, so my partner had to scrape pretty much all of the burger toppings off to make it edible.  Anyhow, we'll probably go back."}
{"text":"I live very close to Park Bruges and have been there a few times and I have ordered out as well. Let me just say the Gemmelli pasta is awesome. I loved it. I have also had the cafe chicken which I really really enjoy. The side salad that comes with it is very good. I have had the poutine as well, which is very good. Simple, but so tasty. They have a good draft selection, including one of the best beers I have tasted. I cannot recall the name of it, but if I had it again I would instantly know. I'm definitely going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a Sunday dinner of \"small plates\" at Park Bruges.  What an awesomely relaxing time!  This is the best meal that you can have in Pittsburgh and still wear jean shorts and a t-shirt.  Service was friendly and prompt, without being overbearing.  We had PEI Mussels (appetizer), Onion Soup, Split a house salad (wonderful dressing), and a Tarte (think wood oven pizza) with creamed leeks, 'shrooms and bacon - heavenly.  The wine pours were heavy (thanks so much!), and the selection definitely above average.  P.S.  loved the music selection and hipster ladies with tats on the service. Wish this was around when I was young and needed a place to impress or hang out - I had to fly to Amsterdam!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this  as much as Point Bruges.  Everything food-wise is pretty much the same, however the space is a bit larger at this location.  I had the liege waffles, which were made to perfection.  It came with bananas foster on top, which was just fantastic.    If you're looking for brunch in the Pittsburgh area, this is one of the must eats in Pittsburgh.  The brunch special is 20-23 dollars, with your main entree, side and drink (whether, beer, mimosa, bellini, etc.).  Very reasonable, considering the quality of the food.    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything was great at this place. My wife took us out for my birthday. I enjoyed everything about the cocktails from the cucumber Tom Collins to the leffe blonde ale. I had the beef shirt rib and found it to be very flavorful and tender. I am a sucker for beef though so perhaps I am bias. My wife had the steak frittes and really enjoyed it. The place isn't huge and seemed very busy for a Wednesday night. The weather was good though so the patio helped turn the people out a bit quicker. I couldn't imagine going in the winter unless you had made a reservation (if that is even an option). Long story short I think it was worth the wait. Will return again some other beautiful summer evening."}
{"text":"We headed out to Park Bruges for my bff's birthday last night....her and her husband have been here several times and invited us along, our first time at Park Bruges. And I have to say, it definitely lived up to the reviews!   We got the Poutine - fries with cheese curd and stock gravy - and the Tarte Flambée - a kind of flatbread (I think?) with marinated tomatoes, olive oil, and cheese -  to share as our apps. Very good! I have to say I've heard nothing but good things about the Poutine, which was delicious. But I actually preferred the tarte. It was light and tasty - a nice appetizer. For our entrees, my husband got the mussels with the green curry sauce and I had the cafe chicken sandwich with a salad and champagne vinegarette (a suggest from my friend). Everything was very delicious.  It's hard to complain about this place, because honestly, there's so much to love. If given the opportunity, I'd give Park Bruges 4.5 stars. Just not quite 5. I'm just going to be a little picky, since all of the reviews are so good and there's little to complain about. My chicken sandwich was very good...chicken was flavorful and the mozzarella and dried tomatoes made the sandwich. But, the bun was just a little too crunchy for my liking, so I ate half the sandwich then took the other half of my chicken and mixed it in with my salad.   The only really negative thing I can say about our first experience was our service. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice, she just really didn't have any sense of urgency. Drinks and refills took several minutes and we had to ask for an extra set of silverware, since there were only 3 on the table. Overall, like I said, she was friendly, just not very efficient.  The restaurant itself is cute. The place is small, but that doesn't bother me. We sat inside, and the restaurant is very comfortable, although it did get quite loud the busier it got. There is minimal seating outside, which is a bummer because I love to sit outside and eat. The problem with sitting outside, if you choose to do so, is this. They don't take reservations. So, if you end up going at prime time, people are sort of just hanging around at the bar or outside, which means, if the latter, people waiting for tables are sort of just hanging around in front of your table while you eat. Could be a little awkward. My suggestion would be to go a early like we did (6pm) or a little later, say after 8 or 8:30."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now. Everything from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food is phenomenal. If I had to knock it on anything it would be that there is not enough seating. I enjoy the mussels, they have a unique taste to them that you can only find at your local Park Bruges. Also their fries (Park Bruges calls them Frites) are exemplary. If you ask me if I will be returning I would grin at you and say \"stay tuned\"."}
{"text":"Excellent mussels great location friendly staff. Something I didn't expect as a neighborhood resturant.  I'd recommend it for a great date place or just a weekday meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in Pittsburgh for the zoo and found this gem.  Food was great, the service better. Walked in around 6ish on a sat and had some fab beer (Corsendonk on tap), great food and nice atmosphere.  Lucky us."}
{"text":"Several years ago, I tried Pointe Brugge for the first time, and Park Bruges had been on my restaurant wishlist ever sense. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, the hubby and I decided to finally check it out.  I was delightfully surprised to see that the restaurant wasn't completely packed on a Friday night - probably because it was the day after Thanksgiving! - and we were given the last two seat table. Neither of us were very dressed up but felt comfortable in the traditional style restaurant among other patrons wearing jeans and even sweatshirts.   Our waitress came and checked on us pretty quickly and consistently popped over throughout the evening. We both ordered beers, and I went with a delicious Belgian on-tap high-alcohol-content offering. I wish that I remembered the name because it was heavenly (especially to this Belgian beer-loving girl).  We started with the Slow Roasted Shortrib Poutine per the recommendation of our waitress who did not steer us wrong. The mixture of the shortribs with the gravy was absolutely heavenly. For our entrees, I selected the mussels with green curry sauce while my husband went with the Jamison Farm Lamb Shank. The mussels were well prepared and the sauce was tasty, but the curry heat began to build up for me and became a bit too powerful for my taste. I had really enjoyed the red curry at the sister restaurant Pointe Brugge and felt that the green curry here was spicier. My husband's lamb was delicious. He quickly ate the lamb, the side sweet potato and brussel sprout hash, and even finished my mussels for me, drowning the bread in the green curry sauce to soak up every bit of flavor.  I'm so happy to have finally tried both of these cousin restaurants and am very pleased with both of my dining experiences. Based on proximity to my home, more attractive interior decor, and that magical red curry sauce, I think that I will likely be going to Point Brugge more frequently than Park Bruges in the future."}
{"text":"We loved it! There was a short wait on a Saturday evening but we sat at the bar and enjoyed some Belgian beers. Our dinners were delicious! The mussels are the best I've had in Pittsburgh! The decor and atmosphere are fun and warm and the staff was knowledgable about both the dinner menu and the beer menu.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to head over to Park Bruges for a casual lunch on a recent summer afternoon. For the majority of the group, it was their first time at the restaurant - this was my second.   The menu is similar to their sister restaurant, Pointe Bruges, but the ambiance of the restaurant is quite different, in that Park Bruges doesn't seem as inviting as is its counterpart.  I enjoyed their 1/2 portion of mussels in a spicy curry sauce. Served with French bread on the side, it is absolutely perfect. The flavors are bold, yet not overpowering. I couldn't resist but finish off all of the broth in the bowl - it's just that tasty.   The bar has a large selection of beer on tap and in bottle. I paired a lovely Belgian beer with my mussels. I could have had another, but had to go back to work :("}
{"text":"I am a Scallop junkie. The scallops at Park Bruges? The best .5 star !!! Service? The Best even though they were very busy. This is a come back for sure"}
{"text":"Dinner: 1/17/14. We enjoy Park Bruges a little more than Point Bruge, simply because it is physically more comfortable and easier to have a conversation with your dinner companions than at it's sister location. While we have eaten there numerous times, who says things can't get even better. This visit rose above the others. The mussels had a new preparation, curry. Delicious, we had to order extra bread [fresh with a crispy crust] and spoons so we could all sip on the broth after the mussels had disappeared. The best was yet to come: Striped Sea Bass, with polenta/artichokes/tomatoes. I am very picky about how my fish is prepared. I don't want it to be dry. The waitress and I talked about the fish and how I liked it to be prepared. She coached the chef, and he or she hit it spot on! It was one of the best restaurant prepared pieces of fish I've ever had. I grew up in a home that great food was expected and good food seen as a disappointment. I didn't expect this fine of a preparation. Also the polenta was creamy, well seasoned and artichokes/tomatoes added texture and taste."}
{"text":"Service, food, drinks are wonderful. Love the atmosphere! Highly reccomend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"While the chorizo omelette chilaquiles style was delicious and creative, Park Bruges is far too expensive for the quality, quantity, and service offered.  The meal was tasty and savory, but what takes it down two stars is 1) for service and 2) for price.  However, if you have no qualms about spending whatever money you want, certainly come here for tasty but small food portions. And you can and should stop reading if you don't care about money or aren't constrained by a budget ! The profit margin for the meal I ordered must be huge for the price. Probably two eggs, 1 oz of chorizo, assorted veggies in the omelette, 8? Tortilla chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa verde $14. Then, the service was mediocre. If having a high price ticket for brunch, the server was often gone for long periods from the time we arrived to ordering to getting the check settled. We got there as soon as it opened as well, so it wasn't too packed.  Parking is easy, and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"We walked in for Sunday brunch and were seated in less time than it takes to drink a glass of water (served by the friendly bartender).  The enthusiastic waiter got our drinks quickly, and we were off to an excellent start.  I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a restaurant by its Bloody Marys, and the one ordered by my sister was delicious (it had fresh dill in it -- inspired!).  But what got my attention immediately was that the unsweetened iced tea was just as delicious.  It's just water and tea leaves!  Why doesn't mine taste flowery and very gently tannic?  I forgot to ask what kind of tea they use, but it tastes fantastic.  This was a good harbinger, and the rest of the meal was just as satisfying.  We got pommes frites for the table, a decision I recommend.  Three of us had vegetable frittatas, which were tasty if maybe just a little more virtuous than necessary, and one had crabcakes with braised kale.  The kale was the best thing on the table -- smoky but bright with tomato sweetness and acidity.  Yum.  We felt we had some indulgence coming to us after our fritattas, so we got the doughnut holes with cherry and chocolate sauces.  Life was then complete.  If I lived in this lovely neighborhood, I would come here all the time."}
{"text":"I've heard people talk about this place all the time and finally decided to go and see for myself.   It was prime brunch time and it was so crowded here that we had to get seated at the bar or else wait hours to get seated.   We ordered the baked french toast which looked extremely appetizing.  When I had a bite it seemed to lack something...There wasn't a lot of flavor in the strawberries that were in the french toast which was pretty disappointing.  I ordered the bruges frites brunch style.  It was a heaping pile of fries, eggs, sausage gravy, and cheese.  The first few bites were amazing but afterwards i found the fries too salty, being covered in gravy made them soggy as well.  Some chunks of cheese were not melted and dispersed well enough either.  I liked the fries that were untouched by the gravy - one of the best fries I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Consistently satisfying place for brunch. I get the Eggs Benedict or potato hash and have never been disappointed. The food is filling, rich, and warms and wakes you up. My favorite to date was a duck and sweet potato hash a few years ago, but the beef brisket and gouda hash from this past weekend comes in a close second."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday, and holy crap did I love my grilled cheese sandwich.  Despite being relatively simple, it was one of the best restaurant versions I've ever had.  The bread was wonderful (and stayed crisp the whole time!), the cheese was gooey and melty, and the oven-roasted tomatoes added a wonderful smokiness to the sandwich.  Imagine the flavor of hearty marinara sauce without the actually messy sauce, and that's what these tomatoes were like.  And I got it with bacon, of course!  Coleslaw on the side to lighten things up, and I was a happy camper.  I ate the whole thing, and since I generally have only a moderate appetite, I think that shows wise portion sizes on the part of Park Bruges.  The sandwich was $9 with bacon, I believe $8 without.  I also got the \"side salad\" which was $7, and seemed expensive, but it was also enormous.  2 people could easily share this and each person's portion would still be larger than your usual \"side salad.\"  I loved the sweet walnuts, and tangy cheese on top to keep the salad exciting.  Service was a little slow, but our server was very friendly and brought us some bread and butter since we were so hungry.  They were busy, but not packed, at 1:15 on a Saturday.  Lunch is a great way to get a taste of this place for a smaller price - and they offer their macaroni and cheese at lunch too!  I wanted so badly to order it, but I was determined to try something new and I'm so glad I did.  I could eat one of those grilled cheese sandwiches every day."}
{"text":"Sure, the moules are good. However, I have two major complaints: 1, An estimated wait time of 45min on a Friday night at a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations isn't a big deal. What is annoying is when that 45 min turns into almost 1.5h as it did for our party. I understand that the restaurant can't control some variables (like how long diners will remain at their tables) but they given the obvious success of the establishment they should either accept reservations or expand. 2. The frites were absolutely disgusting. I've had frites before (in France admittedly, not Belgium), and I don't think they should should be entirely comprised of the burnt, crunchy ends of the fry as ours were. They looked and tasted like the greasy mess that's likely present in deep fryers at the end of a shift. Given the classic combination of moules with frites there's no excuse for messing this up. Overall, recommended with reservations."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the Steak Frites and Moules Frites, and let me just say, they were nothing special. For $29, the steak frites portion was tiny, there were only a few slices of steak, and A LOT of frites. The mussels from the Moules Frites were fine, and were on par with any other mid-range restaurant that serves mussels, and this dish also comes with a whole lot of frites too. We pretty much filled up on frites because they gave so much of it. Honestly, I did not come here to pay $50 to eat 2lbs of frites. I would much rather save my money and eat bigger and better steak at Meat and Potatoes."}
{"text":"Located in a residential area in Highland Park.  Awesome mussels and Belgian beer selection, but you have to pay extra for the frites to go with your mussels.  Service is good.  Wish they were open a bit later (close at 10pm on Fri/Sat night).  All the food I've had there has been great, but I wish their menu was a little bigger.  Atmosphere is pretty modern and felt a little cold for my taste."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend. My eggs benedict and crab cakes were pretty good, nothing spectacular though. We split poutine and it was good, could have had a little more cheese on it. The table behind us ordered mussels, and as soon as they were delivered we started smelling a really bad smell, I watched the ladies at the table and they were definitely turned off by them and told them waitress they were no good. Sort of scared me a bit, it should be pretty obvious to the cook if they had gone bad. Overall it was decent, I don't think I'd seek it out but I would still go back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood.  This has been a great addition to the neighborhood.  It definitely has the feel of a neighborhood restaurant.  It reminds me in that way of an Irish pub except the food is much better!   And the beer list is better.  Which is saying a lot.  It's also a destination restaurant.  People drive in from all over to eat here.  It's casual.  It's friendly.  It has an upbeat atmosphere.  And the food is really good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I feel weird to give this 3 stars when so many people rank it higher, but I was not impressed. To be really honest? The decor was just SO blah. It felt like any old diner (though very clean). If I'm going to be dropping the type of money on brunch and brunch drinks that I am here, I want it to feel a bit nicer and more unique. (Point Bruges does this well!)  The food was good for brunch. I had the brisket and potato hash with a horseradish mayo/hollondaise sauce. The yogurt with granola and fresh fruit was actually really really good. I just find it odd that the yogurt was the thing that impressed me the most..."}
{"text":"Went to Park Brugges for brunch after hearing all the amazing things about this place and its sister restaurant, Point Brugges.  The boyfriend got the gingerbread beer cocktail and really enjoyed it.  We might go back for the Belgian beer selection, but the service was ho-hum (sure they were busy, but I had to ask multiple times for my water to be refilled, server never came to check on the food, etc) and while the food was good, I'm not sure it's worth the price.  We got the tarte flambe-think pizza on a poppadom.  It was flavorful and crispy, and the arugula really complemented the ham nicely.  We got it with a side of potato gratin which was pretty meh.  We also had the brunch-style poutine, and here we were less impressed.  We've both eaten a lot of poutine (I'm from the Canadian border), and there's a certain way it should be--crispy thick cut fries with a rich, flavorful gravy.  The fries were rather soggy (and not just where the gravy hit them) and the gravy was pretty bland. The addition of sausage, while innovative, did not blend well with the gravy, causing the dish to be unnecessarily heavy and sweet.  Maybe we didn't pick the right menu items to fully experience Park Brugges.  I might give it another shot for lunch/dinner, but I won't be back for brunch."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday at peak time and had to wait quite awhile to eat, which we expected as they don't take reservations. As we were waiting, we were given a plate of fries on the house by the hostess which was so nice and totally unexpected. Our dinners were all fabulous and my pork chop was cooked to my exact specification. I think I like the Point Breeze location's food more but the free appetizer was a great touch and wonderful customer service. We would come back again without hesitation."}
{"text":"This is tough! I don't know whether I prefer Point Brugge or Park Bruges..Well, truth be told, I like them both for their own separate reasons. Same but different in their own ways. While we've been to Park Bruges only once, we've been to it's sister restaurant many times.   Park Bruges is a bit more contemporary and doesn't have the neighborhood feel that Point Brugge does, however, the food is exemplary as well as the service. While we were waiting for our table, we stopped each had a drink at the bar. I had a LaChouffe and she had a mixed drink which was very good. While lingering at the bar waiting for our table we noticed how good the food looked and obviously that just whet out appetite.   As per usual, we felt the need to share an order of the mussels and frites. You just simply can't go wrong with the classic white wine broth. The mussels were cooked perfectly and were very clean(little to no grit). The fries...well, both Park Bruges and Point Brugge have this mastered. They're perfect. The problem with the mussels is we want to eat a loaf of bread to make sure we sop up all of the bread. Yes, the carbs are worth it.  For dinner I had the Chicken Milanese which was basically a mixed green salad piled on top of some of the crispiest chicken I've ever had. The lemony breading on the chicken is just exceptional. The one gripe I have with the chicken is that it's pounded very thin and could lead to potential over cooking and a very dry piece of chicken. The dressing on the mixed greens was very nice. I couldn't quite tell what it was, but it was a vinaigrette and it was very nice. The greens, tomators and other veggies were nice and crisp.  She had the special, which was a Bluenose Bass with asparagus and tomato risotto. She loved it. The fish was so meaty it cut like chicken. The tomato risotto was perfectly cooked as was the grilled asparagus. I sampled a little but of everything and while I do not normally eat fish, I would eat this fish.  We also had the Lemon Roulade to go. By far one of the best desserts in Allegheny County. The sauce is exceptional, the cake is moist and delicious. Get one.   The one thing I want to point out is that while you may have to wait, it seems tables turn fast, and that's not a bad thing. Will definitely be back to Park Bruges!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was okay! Entree was decent, but a bit overpriced for what you're getting in my opinion. My fiance tried the mojito, and while it was good, it was super small and not worth the $8. However, their desserts were to die for!! Loved them. Plus, the atmosphere was really nice and the staff was friendly. I'd definitely recommend going as long as you have a thick wallet with you. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great little place - it has become very popular with the locals because of the great beer selections and authentic European fare. I am a huge fan of their moules & frittes, as everyone else is. (Although, if we are splitting hairs, I wish they would omit the cream from their \"Marniere\" sauce - it is quite nice without it at home...  Point Brugge was such a success, it was logical to have them expand out to a second location in order to accommodate their many fans. Service for us has always been spot on; the dishes come out hot, well-prepared, and with a smile. They have a great beer and wine list, and the overall experience and ambience is great. The remainder of the menu is also wonderful (try the rotisserie 1/2 chicken... delicious!) and well worth a try. Very nice restaurant for families - staff were friendly and helpful when we brought our little one along for the ride - she loved the food off the regular menu as well!  Pros: Everything on the menu Service  Cons: Can get somewhat crowded on the weekends, but that's to be understood! Parking is a little rough when the neighborhood is crowded at night"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a salty snack and decided to stop at Park Bruges for their Bruges Frites.  WOW, these fries were delicious! They are thinner cut fries and each bite was perfectly crispy and salty! The garlic dijon mayonnaise was such a good combination with the fries and ketchup was available upon request if the traditional combo is more your thing.  I ordered the side of Bruges Frites for $6 and was surprised by the large portion. It would be perfect to share with a group of friends in addition to entrees or in my case with my boyfriend as a snack.  The restaurant was on the smaller side, but we had no problem getting seated on a Saturday morning.  Street parking was not a problem either.  The menu entrees seemed a little pricey to me, but it would be worth going back to decide if the price is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak frites. Oops. The frites were bountiful, perhaps overly bountiful; however, the steak I received was small, under seasoned, and tough. Curiously, the strange garnish of raw carrot slices was under the steak.  At $17, this hurts.  My friend's poutine was nothing to write home about, but at least was edible. Greyish chunks of short rib sitting in lukewarm gravy with unmelted cheese curds didn't impress us.  Maybe this was the kitchen's B team? That or they were hung over.  Server was friendly but absent during our entire meal. He catered to the couple next to us and bafflingly enough, a three year old boy who wasn't enjoying whatever his mom ordered, but not two thirty year olds with spending power.  Only when we asked for the check did he ask if we were enjoying our food. Apologizing for the steak but offering a free drink \"next time I'm in there\" was a funny non-consolation since a. I don't live in Pittsburgh and b. I'd never come back if I was, so I'll give him a star for that."}
{"text":"Last week I looked for somewhere close to my home in Morningside for a casual but edible (read: not bar food) dinner with my boyfriend, J.  We did not have reservations at Park Bruges but were able to get a table, albeit indoors, around 8p.m. on Saturday evening. Loud with bustling conversation, but not rambunctious drunkards, it was difficult to hear each other and perhaps would have been worth trying to make a reservation outdoors or waiting for an outdoor table.  I've been to the sister restaurant, Point Brugge, but J has not been to either.  I am an extremely picky eater and usually tend toward safe restaurants with somewhat simple menus; J was thrilled to see that Park Bruges offered (reasonably-priced) mussels on their menu.  He chose the spicy creole with sausage and even convinced me to try one, though it was hard to taste it under the spiciness-- he, however, loved them and sopped up the extra sauce with the great crust of bread that accompanied his meal.  It may go without saying that the bruge frites on the side were devoured between the both of us.  I opted for a lighter appetizer of the (original) Tarte Flambee but was a bit nervous that there would be too much creme fraiche, leaving the tarte soggy.  My worries were assuaged as soon as I saw the tarte.  The cheese did not overpower the other toppings; in fact, the carmalized onions comprised the majority of the tarte-topping.  As someone with a small appetite, this was more than enough food for a late dinner; the leftovers were still crisp yet not-too-dried-out for breakfast the following morning.  My only complaint would be that the restaurant seemed slightly understaffed, as our waitress was tending to nine tables, both indoor and out; she did not take our order or deliver our check until prompted by us, which I always hate to do when a server is so busy."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I may be a creature of habit, but this place is my Saturday morning (1 PM counts as morning if you're at brunch) for a reason, other than it being within walking distance of home. It fits my priority for bunch better than any other place:  I have to have a fruity bubbly with my sugar bread and not wait forever for it. I don't like the fuss of the nearby brunch spots; even their sister location in Point Breeze is tiny with a typical brunch wait (they also only serve brunch on Sundays). I have never waited for a table for the +1 and I on a Saturday morning. Never. That's insane in itself. Breakfast without a wait seemed like a dream only served on a plastic dish at Eat N Park. Nah, right here in Highland Park.  So I'm a loser and order the Liege waffles with \"seasonal fruit topping\" (blueberry ginger is my fav), gratin potatoes square, and a St. Germaine cocktail every single week. It's too good not to. The little waffles with the pearl sugar!? Ugh. The 1+ always gets the special, which has been anything from a Greek omelet to an Irish breakfast Ruben. I don't ask nor judge. He hasn't complained yet.  They also serve a really great lunch. Get the fries.  If you want brunch and do not want to wait \"about 45 minutes?\", this is the place to go. Even if they had a ridiculous wait like everywhere else I would probably still show up here.. Those tiny waffles (and full bar!!!) are that good."}
{"text":"Great food. Hipster 9000 crowd. Pretense and prices a bit high. But would come again. With a fedora."}
{"text":"Park Bruges is a lot of positive things, but I like it most because of its charm. Aside from being comfortable, consistent, and a safe choice for any group of people you might eat out with, I'm always impressed with their Belgian beers, well-priced and non-overwhelming wine list, and rotating soups and specials. The staff is always excited, and the atmosphere is good for family, dates, friends, or even just a casual drink and small bite.  Obviously, the mussels are top-notch, but I've also been satisfied with anything on the menu, from the Mediterranean Platter to the Bruges salad (with beets and Beemster cheese) to the short ribs and everything in between. They don't take reservations, so sometimes you end up waiting, but it's tough to get comfort food this good anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Pretty popular so either make reservations (if possible) or plan for a wait. After about 20 minutes we were seated. We ordered waffles and corned beef hash. The hash was very good. The waffles however were not. Lukewarm, very hard and about 30% smaller than a traditional Belgian waffle. I didn't eat more than a third. The bacon was excellent, but at $6 for only 3 slices way overpriced."}
{"text":"Always terrific food!  Needless to say, go for the mussels.  I would have given them 5 stars but my wife orders salmon and the portions are always tiny.  Really weird given the mussels are plentiful.  She doesn't like mussels, so she gets salmon.  We would go more often if ..."}
{"text":"The mussels tasted amaziiiing. Also I had the tarte flambe and it was very good. Steak and egg isn't recommended though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a great place for mussels and Park Bruges was recommended to us. I must say everything we had was delicious, but not as great as we expected. The mussels were almost over cooked, a tiny bit chewy but the original white wine sauce was very nice. I got the red snapper special and my husband got the Bruges burger. My special was phenomenal and fresh and so delicious. Husband's burger was good, but not worth the amount he paid. I think we'll go back again, but choose some less expensive options."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place is a block away. Since I've recently moved and have no food I have been here three days in a row. Every single dish was fantastic. Myself and my roommate have gotten the park burger, macaroni and cheese, the mussels and frites, Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak Salad, and Gemelli Pasta. I can't decide which plate was my favorite so far since they were all completely delicious! I also got the Brooklyn Summer Ale and it was one of the best beers I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I can't recommend this place enough. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that our waitress was a little slow with the service. However, the food made up for it. Also, we got take out twice and it was ready in 10 minutes only."}
{"text":"Really good food here.  Been here several times. I always get the mussels in white wine. They are the best In the city. Last time I was there the food was cold, but that is the first time we have had a problem in a dozen visits. Wife and I go there ever year for our anniversary and it's always a nice evening."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The green curry mussels are to die for. My husband always gets the burger and loves it. Great atmosphere, Belgian beers & frites... What's not to love? Can't wait to try their brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Park Bruges is my favorite haunt.  Their food is delicious and their draft selection is small but mighty.  They now offer happy hour during the week which is great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and everytime is better than the last time. Great food and freat enviroment. Beside the mussles which are great I love the Lamb Shamp plate I have never tried anything like it in US. I also tried the fundy Salmon and its really good. A must try. I will for sure come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection, very friendly but sporadic servers.  I went with my husband and a friend of ours who was in town visiting.  My husband ordered the burger, and enjoyed his food, but what really stood out food wise was their willingness to accommodate my friend's and my meat free diets. There were a few vegetarian options already on the menu, which my friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. They were more than happy to omit meat from their regular menu items as well so I ordered the Tartes Flambee with the fig,arugula and goat cheese without the prosciutto. We also shared an order of their delicious frites.  Overall, nice place-if a bit small- I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is ok....though we do also refer to it as \"Denny's\" I mean...Denny's is ok too right? The mussels in white sauce are way better than the andouie ones which oddly came recommended by the wait staff. This place reminds me most of a restaurant one might find in an airport. In offensive, fine and filled with business casual travelers."}
{"text":"i've gone here for dinner once and brunch twice. i have not been disappointed. for dinner, i got the salmon with lentils. bomb. such great flavors together. the beer selection was also right up my alley. for brunch, i got the biscuits and gravy both times. the first time i got it as part of their prix fixe menu, so i opted for the potato casserole along with my biscuits. the potato thing was just ok. it lacked flavor, but with a little salt, it was better. the biscuits and gravy, on the other hand, were outstanding. topped with a fried egg! nomz! the second time i went, i did not want the prix fixe menu, so i got the biscuits and gravy with a side of frites. holy crap is that a generous portion of fries!!! and the horseradish sauce served with them was awesome. also, BEST BLOODY MARY I HAVE EVER HAD. so much dill and just deliciousness in every glass. i love this place. and the service has always been incredibly friendly and professional. i'd recommend this place a million times over."}
{"text":"Note: During the week, their kitchen closes at 10pm.  This sister restaurant to Point Brugges in Point Breeze (Park Bruges is in Highland Park. Get the pattern?) mostly impressed me the other night but didn't turn the tone of Pittsburgh's culinary scene topsy-turvy either in my opinion. Nor did it throw my personal dining expectations into a simmering pot of turmoil. Allow me to elucidate...  Poutine: I had been coveting it ever since I learned of it through an online forum centered in Canada years ago (don't ask). When I first read of it, I dismissed it as \"disco fries\" or \"fries with gravy and cheese.\" That was until the Canadian users positively jumped all over me for my ignorance, chastising me for making light of what is signature comfort food of The Great White North. \"It's not just cheese, you n00b. It's cheese curds,\" I was snarkily told like a Trekkie who had haplessly wandered onto a Star Wars message board.   The gist of it all was that I simply didn't know what I was missing and would never get to have some \"real\" poutine unless I journeyed north of the border.   So, once I read that \"real\" poutine was being served in a Pittsburgh dining establishment, I just had to go and try that which was forbidden to Yanks such as myself.   Choosing my appetizer was easy to decide. Enthusiastically, I told our excellent server Kristen what I wanted and eagerly awaited it.   What came to our table was a plate full of properly fried (twice) gravy-smothered tater sticks, a cluster of white cubes, and a cup of roasted garlic mayonnaise (my request).   I suppose I got the impression that everything would coagulate together into a heap of divinely fattening chaos, but it didn't quite do that.   Again, the fries were immaculate, the aioli making them mythically munchable, but that gravy was dull, man. I barely detected it. In fact, it got in the way, as did the cheese cubes, which again, hardly registered a blip on the gustatory radar screen. I almost thought the curds were tofu, and the heat from the fries hardly broke them down. That I was able to eat these with my fingers and didn't need a fork was telling. Not that the poutine was abominable at all, and to repeat, this was the first time I've ever had it, but I keep getting the vague feeling that it should have and could have been even better than it was.  I came very close to ordering a burger, but I opted instead at the 11th hour for the more sophisticated (and expensive) Roasted Jamison Lamb.   Hmmm. The lamb was carved into squares that were pink in the center and easily chewable. Roasted apples, pureed parsnip, and a pesto of almonds and caramelized onions added woodsy depth to the plate. The apples and mock mashed potatoes in the parsnip gave me a sense of comfort and familiarity. The pesto was exotic, sylvan, nutty, and saccharine and complimented the puree as well as the protein superbly. The modest serving gave me a reason to savor each morsel, to divide each slice of meat and drag it through the puree and pesto before eating it, to not scarf it down like a famished brute. This was most certainly gourmet and not for gluttons, which kind of describes me...at times.  Kay's 1.5 pound of mussels delighted her almost as much as mussels elsewhere have. After tasting some for myself, I too felt a slight whiff of disappointment in a lobster-pernod, fresh tarragon & basil sauce (one of 3 kinds offered by the restaurant) that was good enough but not amazingly ambrosial and mussels that were surely tasty but lacked the plumpness I have grown accustomed to. Don't misunderstand me. These mussels were fine, but I have doubtlessly had mussels that were bigger, better. *sneeze* Meat & Potatoes *sneeze*  Kay and I were supposed to trade off on a duo of desserts in the Tarte Tatin and a Chocolate Souffle, but Kay pretty much hoarded her souffle since she relished it so much. The Tarte Tatin was described to me by Kristen as an \"upside down apple pie\" but reminded me of a strudel when it came time to eat it. Honeyed and fruity, the soft apples yielded to my fork and teeth perfectly, the crust delivering oodles of texture, the fresh whipped cream knoll cutting the sweetness down a notch. Kay's dessert was essentially a light, cakey mousse that was merely enhanced, not overrun by chocolate. Embraced by a salted caramel, the souffle was not nearly as decadent as one would think, which by no means is a strike against it. To me, however, the Tarte Tatin won the duel, scarcely upsetting the souffle.   Is PBC worthy of the hype? Eh, for the most part, yes. I'd still like to try that burger, though. My decision nags at me.   P.S. The atmosphere was more casual and inviting than I thought it would be. As we waited to be seated (about 15 minutes) we spoke with a party who came all the way from Pleasant Hills to try Park Bruges. South Hills folk will come to the East End for good eats after all. I'm glad I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Bloody Marys for brunch and a great beer selection. Mussels get all the press here, but my fav is the Bruges burger with coleslaw!!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved everything! The food was amazing and so were the staff. Everything was prepared exactly how we wanted it (4 of us had orders that had variations of what was on the menu).   The frites are better than I could put into words. Next time we come I'll be sure to order one of their famous Moules (mussels with a choice of sauce).   Only thing from giving them a five star review is there were fruit flues around our and the neighboring tables - kind of put a damper on everyone's meal after it landed on all of our plates and glasses. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Park Bruges is a simple restaurant. They don't put much effort into aesthetics but they do put a lot into the quality and taste of their menu items. Yesterday was my second time dining at Park Bruges. My boyfriend and I ordered the charcuterie board, green curry mussels, Bruges frites, and the crab cake po boy. The charcuterie board was good overall; we enjoyed all the meats except one that was a bit too salty for us. The (delicious) Bruges frites are listed under \"Small Plates,\" but the portion was quite large. They fill a regular plate up with fries and it is served with aioli. The crab cake po boy was a little sweet, which my boyfriend enjoyed more than I did. But the best part of the meal were the green curry mussels. While the mussels themselves were average to good, the green curry sauce was AMAZING. It is probably the best sauce I've ever had with mussels. The mussels were obviously delicious in them, but I also loved dipping the bread into it as well as the fries, and, honestly, I also just drank it straight out of the bowl. The flavor was perfect and I couldn't get enough of it!  Taste | 4.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Really 4.5 stars. The moules with frittes were excellent just like in Belgium. We really impressed with all the dishes we sampled and the nice selection on tap. Food allergy friendly.  I am rounding down from 4.5 to 4 stars rather than up to 5 stars because it can be a bit noisy--but in terms of the food and service, this is a winner."}
{"text":"Went to Park Bruges for brunch today with the family.  Got there at 11am when they opened and there was already a crowd gathering to get in.  The space is significantly more open than the claustrophobic cramped space of their sister restaurant Point Bruges.  Everyone loved their food.  I had the tarte flambee with Parma ham, arugula, cheese, rosemary, and eggs served over a light, crisp flatbread.  The ham and Gruyere croquet and steak and eggs also received raving reviews from the table.  I had a bite of the kids' liege waffles with ginger blueberries on top and they were delicious.  All of the portions are BIG.  We didn't get the prix fixe (one dish, one side, and one alcoholic drink) and were still stuffed at the end.    Of course, we got an order of mussels to share which were delicious as always.   Service was excellent.  Our servers were bright and friendly and our coffee was frequently refilled.  Overall, the opening of Park Bruges is a wonderful thing to happen to Highland Park.  It gives you the chance to experience all of the excellent food and beer of Point Bruges without being uncomfortably crammed like sardines into a tiny space during the extraordinarily long wait for your table.  I would give Park Bruges 5 stars if it were not for the unsightly and quite frankly ghettotastic vacant lot next door.  Park Bruges sits right next to an overgrown vacant lot that 2 buildings used to occupy (including the old Terry Villa who used to make the best Cheesesteaks in Pittsburgh).  The grass and weeds are so overgrown they're almost above your head.  I know that's not their property, but they should figure out who owns it and offer to cut the grass!"}
{"text":"*This review is only for brunch since I've never been any other time. I have been for brunch about 5 times now though and it's always delicious. The menu changes from time to time, which is nice. They always have a pre fixe selection that includes your drink (mimosa, bloody mary) entree and side dish as well. Oh, and they always have poutine which is a must as a side. I like to go and share one sweet dish and one savory with a friend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 time and haven't been disappointed yet. The first time I ordered a pesto dish (delicious). The next time I went for brunch and got whatever the special of the day was (I believe it was a frittata...whatever it was it was quite good). Most recently I went there for Valentine's day dinner. We had no issue getting a table. We ordered muscles in a red sauce, wings, and the duck leg with pork white beans and vegetables. Everything tasted great. Will definitely be going back there again"}
{"text":"Great brunch at a reasonable price!! Highly recommend the mussels for a starter!!"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood place where the mussels have some muscle and the brews some oomph! And....everything on the menu is truly excellent. The roasted chicken is cracking and their specials will seduce you. Start with the onion soup, share an order of mussels--- I like the green curry sauce but the wine broth is a good classic choice too.   On weekends prepare to wait as no reservations are taken--- the service is good, the people are friendly--it's a place---as the jingle goes \"where everybody knows your name.\""}
{"text":"I had lunch with my boyfriend here before we went to the zoo, and it made for a really nice date!  It wasn't difficult to find parking, the service was great, and the atmosphere was quiet.  The food was really good, and the menu had some interesting options. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer because we were starving.  It was on the sweet side because of the figs and honey but I still enjoyed it.  I ordered the classic Montreal poutine for my meal and my boyfriend ordered the short rib poutine.  We both loved our meals! Also, considering that we needed boxes to take half of our poutine home with us, I would say their prices were reasonable; however, the menu overall is not cheap for lunch.  I would definitely recommend checking out the restaurant if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Park Bruges. We've been to Pointe Brugges for brunch and felt the quality and service were on par at both locations. We sat outside and our party of 4 enjoyed a lovely meal. Two people ordered the steak and eggs, asking for the steak as medium rare, it was more medium. The third member of our group thoroughly enjoyed the Pulled Pork Chile Rojo. I had a salad and frites, FYI the \"side\" order of frites is freakin' huge. Like, dinner plate portion huge. We would definitely go back for brunch and to check out their dinner menu as well. This location seems to be less crowded then the Hastings St. venue and since they don't take reservations I would most likely choice the Park over the Pointe for that reason since both seem to be equally enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm driving with my wife and we were headed to go get some pho for dinner.  I mentioned to her that Park Bruges was close by and all of a sudden she couldn't stop thinking about Park Bruges mussels.  We ended skipping pho and we immediately drove to our favorite restaurant Park Bruges.       We have been here many times but I haven't written a review yet for them.  This place is just us.  My wife always get's their mussels and I order their Bruges Burger.  Her mussels come with frites and my burger comes with a salad.  So we just switch and she gives me her frites and I give her my salad.  That's a happy marriage!  Anyways I love this burger.  If you want to read more about their mussels check out my wife's review (Carrie W).  She says they are the best mussels in the Burgh.         I usually order my burger medium.  My only complaint is sometimes it does get a little greasy on the bottom of the bun but the bun does hold it all in.  It doesn't get soft.  The burger comes with shredded short ribs, gouda cheese, green peppercorn mayo.  This is my favorite burger in Pittsburgh.  My wife usually orders a IPA from their draft list and I usually get a Belgium or German bottled beer.       On other visits we have tried their poutine and it is very good too.  Now a days we are just too stuffed to have their poutine and finish our dinner.         If you come here on a Sunday or right before 5pm you usually can easily get a seat.  After 5 it does get busy.  There is a bar here and no television.  It's just a nice causal place that has good service and great food."}
{"text":"i wish Yelp gave half stars because my actual rating would be 3 1/2 but I normally round up. This is a nice little restaurant tucked in the Morningside area. Street parking is available during the day provided you follow the rules on the sign.  When I arrived the place wasn't too busy. They have a full bar and seating all around it. The place did fill up during the course of my visit. If you are planning on eating lunch you will be given huge portions! My waitress told me that the soup of the day was a creamed cauliflower and broccoli. If you order a sandwich it comes with a heaping helping of coleslaw. They also have full size salads.  I noticed that they have a lunch special of 1/2 sandwich and a cup of the daily soup for $9.00. I saw they have a specially prepared French onion soup that sells for $6.50 for a bowl. If you want it as a cup then you must do the lunch pairing for a slight upcharge. If you do the combination then you won't get the coleslaw.  My food came out rather quickly but I must say service is very slow since I only saw two waitresses there and one manager who asked how my food was. It took a while to get my iced tea refilled but they finally obligized.  In spite of the delay the food did not disappoint. I loved the chicken half sandwich and the French onion soup was to die for!  This alone is worth having and in the future I'd pair it with a small plate.   This is a great place to eat but it does fill quickly. They do need another staff waitress to handle to amount of people that come in. Located near Food glorious food on Bryant St in Morningside it makes a great place for lunch, dinner or even brunch."}
{"text":"We brought our Pitt girl here on Family weekend and were all very happy with Park Bruges' awesome Saturday brunch.  The three of us were drawn to their  crab cakes Benedict with creole hollandaise.  The 2 crab cakes were generously sized and topped with perfectly poached eggs, smothered with hollandaise all on top of a slice of challah-- delicious!  -- though I was slightly disappointed there was no hint of any creole spiciness.  Next time I would just ask for Tabasco. Also shared a single Belgian waffle, served with both blueberry ginger compote and chocolate sauces on the side:). I've never had a true Belgian waffle so don't feel qualified to comment on its authenticity, but thought this was not very special in taste, tho the presentation and sauces were excellent. Service was awesome, prices reasonable for the food.  We didn't partake in the brunch prix fixe deal, which includes a mimosa, Bloody Mary or another (I forget) boozy alternative as well as an additional side order...   Next time!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasure! Visiting from Milwaukee, our local friend suggested this place. As soon as I saw the Frites on a plate on the way in I knew this place was going to be legit. We were a party of 7, 4 arrived first and then 3 later (with 2 hyper kids, mind you). A server's nightmare, right? Nope! The server, Abby, didn't bat an eye. An extra table was brought up and we continued brunch. We felt so welcomed despite our group arriving separately and having some young talkative children. It's experiences like this that unfortunately are lacking more and more. By the way, the chicken waffle (a quarter round) was amazing. The brunch poutine was to die for (their sausage gravy was amazing but no biscuit and gravy option, but it's Belgian right? I'll deal :)  We paid on one bill, which is how it should be (kids) and tipped appropriately.   The service stole the show, which made the somewhat pricey menu worth it. Every penny."}
{"text":"This place is cute restaurant in a quiet neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Before I entered the restaurant there were people eating lunch on the tables outside-which had a very inviting and relaxing cafe feel to the place. As soon as we entered there was someone ready to seat us and we were fortunate enough to grab a window seat (the weather was absolutely beautiful)  We ordered a small portion of the white moules for an appetizer. The mussels are served in a warm white wine sauce and comes with a side of fresh bread. We devoured the mussels then managed to dip the bread in the left over sauce. For individual dishes we ordered the chorizo tarte flambee, steak frites, and brisket sandwich. The tarte flambee was a little too large for me to finish ( and I am a big eater- so it was perfect for me to take home) What I loved most about it was the crunch of the flatbread.  Sometimes the bread gets too soggy with fresh ingredients but this had a good balance between the toppings and the baked bread.  All the portions were generous and not too salty. I am a french fry killer and i thought the ones served with the steak were perfectly crispy- loved it. I also ordered a mojito for lunch and it was delicious. It was a little on the sweeter side but still very fresh and refreshing.   The service at this place was made the whole experience so much better. They were always making sure we had enough water, drinks, napkins at our table and were ready to clear plates at the right time. I've been to Point Brugge a few times but it was my first time here. Park has more seating and more variety on their menu."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, do I love their brunch! Twice now we have joined the line outside to be greeted right when the doors open to be seated right away. The ambiance is clean and simple and a little on the smaller size. Our service has always been with a smile and prompt. Both times I've gotten the ham eggs benedict, which is a hefty portion and the chive hollandaise sauce is scrumptious! I've had a bite of the waffles and it was equally scrumptious! I will say their potato gratin is a must order on the size every single time. They have specials everyday and they always make my mouth water. I like any place that keeps the coffee coming and you feel like you could spend hours there catching up with a friend. We will be back! I can't wait to try dinner at some point. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was just OK! It is definitely over priced.  The sausage was over spiced."}
{"text":"Last night was maybe my fourth time at Park Bruges and they have all been great experiences.   The menu is nearly identical to its Point Breeze sibling (which I also love). Overall, I think I prefer Point Brugge, but I can't exactly pinpoint the reason. Maybe my experiences have been just a bit better there. It could also be because the restaurant is a block from my house.   Anyway, Park Bruges offers a mix of sandwiches, salads, and larger entrees. Two other items they are known for are poutine and mussels. I have had mussels at Point Brugge and they were great, so I would imagine the same would be true here.   On my most recent trip (last night) I had the flat iron steak salad, which was delicious. In addition to the juicy, medium-rare steak, the salad came complete with bleu cheese, tomatoes, herbed potatoes, and a champagne vinaigrette. Totally awesome.   In the past I have also had some of their pasta dishes which have all been excellent as well. Dessert items vary, but last night we had a flourless cake with raspberry mousse filling and, while one slice is large enough to share, I could have eaten literally the entire cake. It was that good.   Service has always been great, too. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best FRENCH ONION SOUP!!!! The staff is always great and the food is always fresh!  I will continue to go back there"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.   Why?   It's so consistently good. We keep coming back for more.   The service is great and attentive. The food is always piping hot and delicious. The prices are reasonable for what you get. And the atmosphere is clean and comfortable.   If you are a booth lover like me, this place is for you! It's at least 70% booths/banquets. Yes! I also enjoy sitting at the bar. (My only complaint is they don't have purse hooks at the bar ... such a necessity! Hopefully they add those soon.)   As far as drinks go, their Moscow Mules do not disappoint and I always find a tasty beer or wine to try.   As you will see in other reviews here, Mussels w/ classic sauce and frites are where it's at. They also serve my husband's favorite burger in town. It's all about the bun!   Do yourself a favor and check this place out ... just know that there is almost always a wait so if you want to get in right away I recommend a geriatric 5:00 p.m. dining hour. Or lunch. It's also a great spot for lunch. :)   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my new \"cheers.\"  I live about a block away and it's become a nice meeting space.  The food is always delicious and pretty high-quality/fresh. I don't like mussels- but I've heard these are some of the best in Pittsburgh.   Otherwise the menu doesn't change, and there is nothing unique here. Don't expect to have your mind blown, but do expect to have a good meal (I love their salmon salad).  There poutine is great as are the flatbreads.  The drinks and cocktails are solid and reasonably priced.   Decent wine selection and rotating beers. Once again they are your standard cocktails and nothing will blow your mind, but that's not always a bad thing.  The ambience is usually awesome too it's fairly quiet and they have a decent sized bar to sit and visit at. I've never had bad service, and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"What a fantastic ambience and menu! I have brunched here multiple times, usually opting for the outdoor seating. The mussels are amazing, especially the green curry and classic white wine butter broth. The specials are always great. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Big fan! It has been SO LONG since I have been to a place with a solid Montreal poutine. We had no wait when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and were promptly greeted and sat. The brunch burger was delicious! The BLT was alright.   Definitely will be back, worth a trip if you haven't been."}
{"text":"One simple little statement:  Get the Brugge burger.    I was leaning pork chop but our server gave me the ol' crinkly face when I asked her opinion, and in the \"oh-crap-I-don't-have-a-plan-B-what's-the-first- thing-I-see\" moment, I see burger.  Meh.  Okay, rough week, let's indulge.  Burger comes.  Looks okay.  No lettuce, no tomato, just burger, mayo, cheese, a bit of short rib chillin' under gouda.  Decide I'll ask for the LT, but no servers to be seen, I grab the bun.  It's crispy/flaky on the outside.  I am intrigued.  I go in for the bite.  and...BOOM.  Best burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  Lettuce & tomato is for chumps.  Seriously, this thing is fantastic; some people describe things as a \"party in my mouth.\"  Well, if it's normally just a party, this is a Tiesto-DeadMau5 rave.    Get the Brugge burger.  (Yes, I only gave it 4 stars...it looks modern/chic inside, which is not at all like Belgium, and I think a place that has a good beer list should have a great bar, but it looks like more of an afterthought.)"}
{"text":"I just made my first trip to Park Bruges.  We were driving around Highland Park, looking at houses, and realized that a beer would definitely be a good thing right about then.    I've only been to Point B. once, (sister restaurant), it was crowded and too loud and I was in a bad mood at the time so I can't really say much about it as a comparison.   I think I was looking at houses then, too.  I've been looking at a lot of houses lately and I'm often not in a good mood afterwards.  I really don't think I want to own a house again.  But that's not what you are here to read, is it?  I will say that I left Park Bruges in a very good mood, which is a good sign for them as one comparison point.  The service was very friendly and they were knowledgable of the menu--both food and beer.  I thought the mussels were very good--we also had a Tartine that was tasty but could have been cooked a bit more.  The selection of Belgian Beers was more than adequate.     My only complaints are that 1) they need sun screens for the windows!; 2) it could be 'warmed up' a bit; and 3) it would be nice to invest in a sign for outside.  But if you need a nice, big booth, not too loud, and good food and beer, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch and people watching! The place is very cute, and the service is friendly and not at all rushed. The menu has lots of entrees and a la carte items including waffles and omelets and salads and mussels..... but I think the best way to go is to choose from the prix fixe option: there are many, many choices... and each comes with an entree, a side, and a beverage.  I had a mimosa (yum!) with a frittata of the day (white beans, roasted tomatoes, broccolini, and fresh pesto) with a side potato gratin. The frittata was almost to large to finish, and the flavors of the fresh ingredients melded perfectly. The potatoes were a yummy stack of creamy deliciousness. It was a great way to begin the day!"}
{"text":"Park Bruges is a hidden gem in Pittsburgh that is growing! This was one of my first dates with my girlfriend and it was a success. We got a bottle of wine to start the meal that was priced reasonably, and delicious. For an appetizer we split the Macaroni and Cheese with jalapeños in it. So savory and good!! The slight heat was awesome! I got the Steak Frites, and it was arguably one of the greatest steaks I've ever had!!! The fries were mostly likely the best ever! My girlfriend got a shrimp linguine dinner that was cooked to perfection! She loved it as well. For dessert we shared a chocolate waffle with homemade ice cream that was Carmel Salted Vanilla!! This made for a great conclusion to one of our first dates. We already have talked about going back soon. Park Bruges head chef, Chef Jason, came to our table to ensure our meal was up to his standards. A+++++!!! Park Bruges is perfect for date night, dinners, dinners with family and friends, and special occasions!!!"}
{"text":"I came here twice, for brunch and for dinner. I loveeeee it. For brunch I ordered two entrees because I was starving, I got eggs Benedict and their Belgium waffle. Both of them are phenomenal. It's plates licking good! Belgium waffles reminds me of the waffles from wafflonia.  For dinner, I came with bunch of friends. We ordered many things to share. We got the mussels with classic wine sauce, yum I don't even like mussels but because of their sauce I had two :-p we also dipped the French bread with the classic wine sauce, and ended up having two bowls of bread. Yum, the sauce is so tasty. We also got cheese plate, which is small to share with five people. It's more suitable for two or three people. We also got the frites, salmon, and their ribs. Wow everything was amazing. The portion and the price were pretty reasonable too. We were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant, we didn't realize they were already cleaning up already. They did not rush us at all and were still filling our water. The waitresses here are so friendly. I am now a big fan of Belgium food! Thanks park Brugge"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers available.  I do enjoy Sunday brunch here. The pesto hollandaise that comes with Eggs Benedict is nothing short of perfection. Liege waffles with chocolate---OMG!!! And finally the veggie frittata...jeez is it delicious. They also do a prix fixe brunch. The items I've mentioned are what I've had on different visits. Imagine trying to eat all of that at once. They also make pretty amazing salads which I've had for lunch. Another lunch fave is the Steak Frites."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Saturday brunch and we found an amazing one!! This place is the real deal for brunch!! Crab cakes eggs Benedict was amazing, the best crab cake I've ever had topped with delicious hollandaise and egg. We also got the Tarte, also delicious! We order the donuts as an appetizer, they were tasty, but there was so much food I would cut them out next time."}
{"text":"Maybe the best burger I've ever had. The Bruges Burger was a small bit of braised short rib with Gouda on an excellent sourdough ish brioche. The burger was juicy and tasty and nothing short of perfect.   Poutin was too salty for me, but replaced them with regular fries which were great!"}
{"text":"Park Bruges is an OK restaurant -- it's clean, easier to get a seat than it's sister restaurant and the staff are nice but some of the dishes are way overpriced and some worse than others.   I would stay away from the French toast, and poutine. The French toast serving was puny..  looked like half of a toast with jam and did not taste great. The fruit accompanying this half toast were also fit for a toddler.. the single slice of cantaloupe and pineapple were so thin, it disappeared into nothing. The sad little grapes only had 2 that were edible. The poutine was too salty and the cheese curds were a little scarce.   The mussels were fine but the bread that accompanied the dish was so stale, my friend had trouble pulling it apart.   My favorite dish that I tried was the tarte flambé, which was crisp and flavorful with two eggs with runny yolk on top."}
{"text":"Another highly talked about restaurant in the bag!    I know just a few days ago I raved about the cute little neighborhood of Highland Park, but I must say again, it's adorable!  I'm just surprised that most of the storefronts on this road were shuttered or closed down.  It's a shame with Park Bruge being so popular... You'd think more people would come out here seeking other businesses.  But I digress...  A late afternoon lunch offered a chance to slip right in.  Still being on a diet, I resisted the urge to order the poutine (soon, my friends, there will be some cheat days!).  I saw the Spinach Salad and thought, perfect!  The salad comes with strawberries, pears, dried cranberries, candied walnuts and multigrain crostini.  I also added in portobello mushrooms for an extra $2.  Good choice on my part!  The bello's were nice, big and juicy and a perfect addition to a flavorful salad.  I really enjoyed the creamy chevre walnut dressing too, especially because they don't scrimp on it (if you like light dressing you might want to get it on the side).  I also really loved the candied walnuts (dah!).  There was a ton of spinach, so you really don't have to worry about it being a dinky salad!  The crostini, meh, I took a couple nibbles but left most aside.    The service was extremely friendly but laid back.  To the point where if you had somewhere to be, you may want to keep an eye on time, it can get a little slow.    I definitely want to come back off diet so I can indulge in some of the delicious looking items ie POUTINE!"}
{"text":"The food is great! While the presentation of the short ribs could have been better, it was delicious. A few of my friends got the Chicken Milanese and it was even better.  The service was also good. Very friendly."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been here multiples times for brunch and dinner, and a few times just for drinks. All of these experiences have been great.  I can never resist the mussels with white wine sauce - I always ask for extra bread to soak up the extra sauce so I don't \"waste\" a single taste! Also AMAZING is the flat iron steak salad. I ask for the steak medium-rare and it is always cooked to perfection. The warm potatoes and champagne vinaigrette create a great combination with the blue cheese and caramelized onions (if that sounds strange to you, you'll have to trust me and try it!). I try the mac & cheese everywhere I go, and I have to say this is not my favorite mac & cheese in town (it is a little thick for my liking), but it is good. And don't forget to save room for dessert!  Prices are reasonable and the fact that it is BYOB (not advertised, but you can bring your own bottle for a $5-10 corking fee), makes it the perfect place to have a nice 3-course dinner for 2 without spending over $100.  Brunch has some similar options to its sister restaurant, but it also has some new/different items. Among my favorites are the eggs benedict, veggie frittata, and salmon scrambler.  Last, if you love Belgian beer (like I do), you will appreciate their selection and the bartender's knowledge. They can make good recommendations based on your preferences, so it is a good place to try out some new brews."}
{"text":"It was nice but unexceptional.   Some of the friendliest service you'll find anywhere.  An extensive and reasonably priced belgium beer list.  Attractive ambiance.  But the food?  Despite legitimate belgium dishes like mussels in white wine sauce and fries with gravy (poutine) every dish we tried was universally heavy and bland.  They have live jazz nights and it's a cozy place to catch up with friends.  I love belgium brews, and I'd gladly come back for drinks but I'd pass on the pricey but mediocre food."}
{"text":"We came here as our last stop in Pittsburgh. I am a fan of poutine fries and heard they make a traditional one. I also had the mussels in wine sauce and the other half had a BLT. Service was a tad slow for not being that busy. I am not sure if the fries in a poutine are meant to be all brown and burnt looking, but that is how ours arrived and I wasn't a big fan. The biggest offense for me were the mussels which had a strong smell of urine. I googled this, and some say this is the smell mussels can get, because they lay around in their own pee. Whether or not this is true, I am going to pass on mussels from here on out. The broth however was very nice, and hid the overall string stank..Plus I didn't die, so maybe everything was OK after all. I expected a big more from the place, and I not sure if I would return"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go here ever since I moved into Morningside. It troubles me I that I have eaten at so many restaurants in Pittsburgh, but never took the time eat at this local joint. I feel a mixture of sadness and happiness after visiting PBC. This place is awesome and I will be coming back. The decor, service, and food are top 5 stars. All I can say is that I was a little disappointed with the range of the beer menu. I was extremely pleased with my salad, but judging from the to wish I had order the mussels. They looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was perfect. My sister swears by the roasted half chicken, which is served on a bed of frites, pearl onions and vegetables in pan sauce, so that's what I had... Magnificent, if too generous! Her husband had the mussels, Spanish Romesco style, and I had a taste of the delicious sauce on a bit of bread. I fully understand why this is her favorite place to eat and I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"AH! YES!  I have been trying to get to Park or Pointe for years now, and finally got my wish. Of course, I headed straight for the muscles, and they were DIVINE! A fabulous white wine sauce drowns these delectable muscles in goodness, to the point when, after the bread is gone, you want to scoop spoonfuls of it in your mouth. YUM.  My husband and I split the Bruges Burger, done medium rare, along with a side of greens. The burger was done to spec, and was delicious.   The service was prompt and respectful, and the atmosphere was hopping. A little loud, but it was to be expected, noting the popularity of this location."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch is certainly the highlight of this place. The scrambled eggs with chorizo was delicious..will be been for more.   We've been here for dinner as well, but was not as impressed as brunch.   Service is always friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"I would actually rate this more at a 3.5 and rounded up. Had the veggie burger, it was good. Not spectacular but a very good one. Cheers,"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've waited so long to Park Bruges- it has been a favorite of the hubs and I since moving to Pittsburgh. Now that we live in Highland Park, and 2 blocks from Bryant St., we go almost every week.  To start, the wait is usually long. They don't accept reservations, so don't go here if you're looking for something quick. Do check it out if you want to taste the best mussels I've had in Pittsburgh. You're almost immediately greeted by the manager/hostess and put on a seating list. Grab some drinks at the bar, or if you prefer, run next door to a local bar for a few beers.   I HIGHLY recommend the house salad- the champagne vinaigrette is AMAZING and will make even the strongest hater-of-salads sing a different tune. Any of the appetizers are worth a shot, but our personal favorite is the mac&cheese. It's creamy with a hint of spice.   For dinner, hands down the moules frittes. Our personal favorite is the classic white wine, although we've tried every option. Get extra bread for dipping, and maybe a spoon. The sauce is THAT good. The fries are crispy and totally worth the calories you consume. If you have room for dessert try the flour-less chocolate cake.  Good food, good service, good price... 2 blocks from home... can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"First time at Park Bruges! Went for the brunch and was extremely satisfied. The open faced BLT was amazing."}
{"text":"Great brunch, poutine fries are a must!! My boyfriend ordered a special when we went, omelette with brussel sprouts, cheese, etc, it was fantastic. I ordered the beef brisket hash, really good just a lot of food!!! The regular poutine fries are so good, I don't know how they keep them so perfectly crispy! A must try!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place when visiting the burg! I've eaten mussels at some world class places and these were better than the best I've had!"}
{"text":"We went about 6 on a Thursday eve. Greater and seated immediately. The place is clean and very pleasant atmosphere.  We had the scallops and steak salad for our entrees the charcuterie board for app and the chocolate flourless cake for dessert.  Everything was fantastic. Portions size, how they were cooked, how they were served all on point. The service is attentive and friendly yet not irritating.  They have great water too, water people will get what I'm saying.  Only my second time to this long time gem (first time was great too) and we plan on returning."}
{"text":"The Park Brugge in Highland Park has the best brunch in town. I had the mushroom fritatta with goat cheese. The goat cheese was so fresh and they used just the right amount of herbs. We also shared a waffle with berries and whipped cream. The wait staff was very nice and helpful and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to Park Bruges I have been astounded.  Nothing I have ever had there has been bad.  My recommendation first and foremost is to try their frites - you will not be disappointed.  It comes with a garlic mayonnaise which will knock your socks off.  I have been there for both brunch and dinner, and it is wonderful for both.  The wait staff is great and very efficient.  Their cocktail list also features some delicious choices that go very well with your meal."}
{"text":"So, I take you all pretty seriously when you talk about pounds of mussels and bruises from frites, so I ran the gauntlet of this dangerous-sounding one-two food combo and I'd like to think I came out the victor. I even had my frites laying helplessly in pools of their friends' - the mussels - green curry. No seriously, that was a great decision - putting the fries in the mussel sauce, that is! Not going to lie, the frites were not the most impressive iteration of the potato that I've ever had, but they were a nice psychological flotation device to have on hand when I started to panic and think I was too deep in fancy waters. Having said thaaaat, this restaurant is gorgeous! Nicely lit, lovely location with a quaint view from the ginormous windows at night. The standing bar was a bit too close to the sitting bar, as my group found out when we were asked to violate the fire code by waiting there until our table was ready, but I doubt this is frequently a problem - the restaurant is rather small for its popularity, yes, but we went on a rainy day, so the outside option was unavailable. The service was also excellent (our server, at least!), and, I'm not sure if it is their dress code...literally....but all the servers were wearing cute little dresses that were all different, but all attuned to the ambiance of the place! (Oh, and they were all female, hope that helps in your visualization.)  Everyone at our table got something different, including the day's special (which was juicy, juicy duck with grilled seasonal vegetables), french onion soup (which I hear was delicious, but did not try), salmon (which was literally phenomenal), and a tarte flambee (which I also did not try...starting to see the new gluten-free trend?). That didn't even slow us down! Next up was the strawberry shortcake, which I was assured was tasty, and the gluten free chocolate cake, which is stuffed with a delicious cream that CHANGES FLAVOUR EVERY DAY. Changes. Every. Day. And the gluten free chocolate cake stays the same! Which is good, because that thing was perfect. I will be back. For that. Every day?"}
