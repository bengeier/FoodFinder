{"text":"Not just a grocery, but more of an old world-style bodega. Grab an espresso or a cone of Boreal gelato while perusing the dry goods. They carry fresh Ontario produce as well as bulk items (nuts, grains, etc.), and the owner is a gem--really just a delight to chat with. Oh, and they make a mean salad, although the sandwiches also look pretty tasty. Totally one of my favourite new Toronto spots."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little shop tucked away just East of Dufferin on the North side of College. I ride past is almost everyday and until recently, didn't even notice it. I'm glad I finally went in.

Senisi's is tiny. Really tiny, but in a good way. You can get sandwiches, gelato, fantastic coffee, great soft drinks and even a few groceries but you'll either have to take them to go or sit in the front. That's not a bad thing because there is a tonne of natural light that comes in the bay window and you can people watch for hours. Dufferin and College can be a fun spot to pass the time.

I strongly suggest you stop by Senisi's if you're in the neighbourhood and looking for great staff, great customer service, great conversation, great food or great drinks."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this authentic Italian deli/coffee shop while travelling in Toronto. The owner and chef was really warm and polite and suggested I try the meatball sandwich when I asked what was popular. The sandwich was like no other meatball sandwich I've ever tasted. Coming from an Italian family, I can honestly say the sauce and the balance of taste reminded me of Nonno's cooking. Don't walk past this place!"}
