{"text":"They held our table even though we were late. The honey butter and bread was so good! We all had the Caesar salad and being garlic lovers we were not disappointed! My mushroom steak was tender and delicious! The mashed potatoes were creamy and so good! Definitely worth the 3 hour drive!"}
{"text":"I had my doubts after reading the Yelp reviews, but boy were we pleasantly surprised! We had a 6-hour layover at the airport so we decided to go out for dinner here. Every single dish we ordered tasted amazing. The steaks were tender, the fried chicken was juicy and delicious, salads were tasty, and the creme brulee was out of this world! The service was equally awesome - exceptionally so, actually. My mom had bought some cookies elsewhere and the restaurant allowed us to enjoy them as our dessert after our meal - which sounds simple enough, but most restaurants don't allow any outside food to be consumed at their tables. This place is top notch if you're having to hang out near the airport for a while and want a nice meal. Will definitely go back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Canyon Creek gives you the highest quality beef possible out of all steak houses within this price range.  On top of that food here is flavourful, bold and refreshing.
I find that most steak restaurant tend to overcook my steak. I have been here three times and my steak was cooked perfectly each time. 
My girlfriend and I actually went to Tom Jones Steakhouse, which costs over $100 person, three weeks before we came to Canyon Creek for the first time. Interestingly, we were both craving for Canyon Creek instead of Tom Jones a month later. 
Simply put, this place gives you good quality beef with chefs that really knows how to cook at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome food with laid back service. Enjoyed a great dinner with the family - kids were served well with great food and I enjoyed an excellent dinner with my wife. Great atmosphere with most tables feeling private. Highly recommend for just about any demographic."}
{"text":"First and last time going there. Though the service was okay, the food was not. I Ordered the \"Got Cheese Chicken Penne\" and \"Pan Roasted Salmon.\" Chicken Penne was decently priced. But it wasn't anything extraordinary - I've had better. It was very sweet tasting, which I didn't like at all. Serving size was a good amount for one person. 

The amount of Pan Roasted Salmon you're served compared to the price ($30) is ridiculous. I thought it was a main dish prior to ordering, but looks more like a starter/appetizer."}
{"text":"A good places close to the airport where you can enjoy a descent steak. Service is very friendly, location nice and the food comparable to other steak chains, e.g. Outback. I chose the sirloin 10oz and it came exactly the way i wanted it. Prices are decent and if you get to have a discount voucher from a close-bye hotel you get another 15% on food. Overall ok to go."}
{"text":"A chic, romantic atmosphere with good service. Our server was polished and very engaging. Although we had a party to attend to after and did not have a lot of time, our server was attentive without making us feel rushed. Each course was served exactly as ordered but tasted standard. My partner an I went with the special winter set menu that came with a tasty Cesar salad, a dry Chicken dinner entrée (wasn't too fond of the sauce that came with it) and a very sour and flakey Peach Cobbler dessert. Final price was okay but not worth the food I got... The only highlight of my meal was the honey butter given together with the complimentary bread which was to die for! If I decide to come back, I'll probably order from the actual menu and not the set menu - lesson learned."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for new years eve. It was a last minute booking so we were just happy to get in. Our booking was for 8:15 but didn't get seated til 8:30. That was ok with us considering it was NYE.
We were taken to our table near the cozy fireplace and had a moment to glance over the menu before our server, John came over. He was awesome.
He came over with some warm bread and a sweet butter which was amazing. For starters we ordered the sweet potato fries and spicy calamari. The fries were also very nice and the dip was great too. The spicy calamari was ok, but nothing to rave about.
For our mains I ordered the Chicago cut steak medium rare with creamy mashed potato and my partner ordered the chipolate steak medium rare with creamy mashed potato. We waited a little while but we were in no rush whats so ever, as we were enjoying our bottle of red ironstone wine and nibbling on our starters still. When the steaks came out they looked amazing, my steak was cooked to perfection, so juicy, soft and red inside. It tasted amazing! I tried a bite of my partners steak which was also very very nice with the goat cheese melting on top.
As we slowly enjoyed our meal a couple behind us in a booth were very lovely Dovey as they just got engaged. So cliché but lovely to see.
After finishing (almost) our mains we ordered dessert. I got the individual brownie whilst my partner wanted the pumpkin creme brûlée . John informed us that he brûlée was all gone but suggested the banana coconut cream pie as it was his favorite. When our desserts came they looked delicious! I tired a mouthful of the banana cream pie and was in love, it was so light and fluffy which was a great way to end a heavy meal. My brownie was also very good ( when are brownies and ice cream with caramel sauce not good) but felt it was to heavy after a big meal.
Overall the this restaurant was terrific. John our server was great, he wasn't pushy or clingy, he wasn't absent and hard to get a hold of. Fantastic night and would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant ever tried!
Please see pictures . Absolutely everything was wrong! 
First I ordered a bloody Mary and I got an extra spicy bloody Cesar, finally after 35 minutes I got a bloody Mary with half of the tabasco bottle was in it! And I usually enjoy \"spicy\".

And see picture of the ugly soup. 
See picture of the black overcooked chicken \"toxic\"
The chicken taco was cold with a large onion skin in it!  And the rest was just as bad on taste. 

Services: mess up, they never knew who order what, mixed plates with different tables etc..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner here June 30th. Service was amazing, thank you Taylor!

Food was great and portions were huge. 

Will be back again. Open table helped with the reservation"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with this restaurant.  We visited this restaurant back in July.  The food wasn't much better than your average Kelseys with a higher price point and the service was terrible! I had the prime rib dinner which was mostly fat! There was a group of us dining and we all said we would never come back!"}
{"text":"I'm here as I write this review.

This place is horrible. It took the server almost 20 minutes to take our order like wtf. Gave us shitty multigrain, yes multigrain, bread. With some nasty butter. We ordered a sangria as well and it literally tastes like pubes. 

Just finished dinner. I ordered the 14oz Rib Eye steak and my wife ordered the steak and lobster mash. worst presentation I've ever seen. the steaks were okay. definitely overpriced.

Only giving 2 stars because their calamari was decent.  And they played arcade fire one time. Anyway screw this place. Just go to a hot dog stand you'll get a way better experience."}
{"text":"Best hamburger I have ever eaten. Apple smoked bacon cheeseburger. The steak was delicious as well. Great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the '5 at 5 Wednesdays' where Canyon Creek has a select menu for $5 appetizers and beverages from 5 pm to 11 pm in the bar section.

Some notables are the 'Prime Rib Sliders' which is 3 sliders packed with thinly sliced prime rib beef with jus and horseradish sauce on the side for dipping (reg. $12.95), the 'Golden Calamari' which is a generous serving of the standard dish (reg. $10.95), and the 'Canyon Creek Dip' which is their version of a spinach and artichoke dip (reg. $10.95). 

With drinks like Gin and Tonics and Stella Artois draft for $5 as well, its hard to justify going anywhere else on a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"We were there on a Monday evening that we were the only customers.  A lot of customers in the adjacent pub, though. The waiter was by courteous and one of the best service I've had.  

The steak was great. So does others on the menu."}
{"text":"Slow but the prime ribs are soooo good. The brownie is good as well. The salmon is so-so."}
{"text":"FIVE stars for the food -- OUTSTANDING! 
Three stars for the service -- friendly hostess, but a bit of a stuffy waiter. Was not happy that we didn't order wine -- ah ... but we made up for it in the tip. Happy waiter later."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last traveled in the area so I forget what I had to eat. I do know that the food, service and ambiance were all great and I was relaxed and contented. It is on my travel list of places to go to whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fair. I had  what they called a Cobb salad which didn't amount to much. That plus a Cesear salad and two drafts was over $50 Cdn"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the service here! From the moment we arrived to when we left it was top notch!! Kenny our server was the bomb.com!!! Seamus the manager was amazing!! 

My husbands steak was a little over done and without a hitch Kenny took it back and Seamus came by to apologize! The steak was returned to perfection and all was great! They saved the steak!!! Desserts arrived on the house for the inconvenience! Nice touch guys!! 

They saved the Valentine's Day dinner thanks guys!! Too bad Barbarians Steak house can't take pointers from these guys!!! Don't go to Barbarians worse service and food is meh!! Go to Canyon Creek best service EVER and the food surpassed expectations!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to have dinner one night (my husband, myself, and three kids) and the front desk attendant at our hotel recommended Canyon Creek.  The adults tried the special summer prix fixe menu and our kids had chicken fingers and fries.  Everyone left full and happy.  Service was very polite.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Go get the canyon dip and the prime rib sandwich, you won't be sorry! The goat cheese pasta was good as well. Nice cozy spot and the wait staff was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Food and service was what we'd expect for a busy Saturday night and a big group... however, WATCH YOUR WALLETS!!  We were pick-pocketed right in front of our eyes, likely by a patron.  Regrettably, we won't be back again.

It's really too bad because we chose this restaurant due the ambiance, price point and quality of service and food, which were ideal for a big family group.  We made an early reservation to celebrate a loved ones birthday.  Highlights of the meal included friendly service, prix fixe menus (folks liked the prime rib and steak, for example) and family-friendly atmosphere (many people with babies and kids).  Everyone was pretty happy with their food, which included appetizers, wine, a range of mains and desserts (crème brulée, brownies and pecan pie were yummy).

The service staff did feel badly and were apologetic about the theft (incl Management), however, the fact that someone dug into a purse and ruffled through pockets that were not exposed or in the open, is really unacceptable, disappointing and will keep us from visiting again.  To confirm that it was a patron that was responsible for the theft, my loved one called her credit card company immediately only to learn that their card was blocked because of some irregular purchase attempts at Scarborough Town Centre within an hour of us discovering the theft.

For big groups, there really are a few options for where to sit in this restaurant (you will be right in the middle!)  so beware, folks!  Spacing is tight, and that means that many people will be walking by your jackets and personal belongings.  It doesn't matter how well you conceal your items (for example, the wallet stolen was in a small, closed purse with a scarf stuffed on top, tucked into a seat), but with so many people walking by, the opportunity is great for those with fast fingers!"}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious lunch with my coworkers. Didn't have such high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. We were a party of 10, so they gave us a private dining room. The restaurant itself is decently decorated although a bit dark on the inside. They served delicious fresh bread with sweet honey butter while we waited for our meal. For my starter I chose the Hickory Smoked Pulled Chicken Salad which was an interesting mix of flavors (melon, chicken, lettuce and hazelnut). My entree, the Grilled Jail Island Salmon on a bed of lentils, was superb. It was probably the best of the three options on the fixed price menu. For the dessert I was leaning towards the apple crumble but ended up getting the Chocaholic Pot de Crème instead, which is a delight for chocolate lovers.. but a little too much chocolate for one person to finish! The service was excellent, with the waiters patiently attending to our needs and getting us to go boxes as required. Bill came out to be $19 per head including tax and tip, which is quite reasonable considering its prime location and the quantity of food served - this is not one of those fancy places that charges exorbitant rates for bite sized meals. I would highly recommend this place, and will be back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today and we were all impressed which is normally not the case when the 12 of us go out for a meal. I had the 'simply fish' entree. I just love their bread and the honey butter that they serve with it. I ended my meal off with one of their starbucks specialty drinks since I was pretty full at this point. Those of us who had the coconut cream pie and cheesecake were happy. The prices were very reasonable. Since we were a big group, they put us in this little room and it had a cabinet with paper (like a whiteboard) for meetings. I will definitely return this restaurant."}
{"text":"we ordered the special and an appetizer.  They forgot to bring out our appetizer and our fish entree was too dry.

i was not impressed of the food but we only ate there because of the quick service (so we thought) .

for the price that they charged us, i gave this restaurant a two stars; had it been less expensive, it would have received three stars.

nothing to write home about but the food experience was worth to YELP about."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer and the food and atmosphere are always great. The wait staff remember what we normally order. The new menu is pretty decent - especially the Asian Nachos. The Caesar salad is terrific - well dressed with smoked bacon and shaved asiago. The steaks are very good, certainly a cut above the Keg."}
{"text":"Usually service is great and food great but when I came in two weeks ago for a farewell work lunch the southern chicken sandwich tasted like it was cooked in old oil. My coworker and myself had to break off the burnt parts of the burger. I think Friday's they are just too busy since other days of the week the food is good"}
{"text":"I guess I do come here very often, because I came here again on Dec 26 for dinner. 
This time, I ordered their Ahi Tuna Salad. Got a nice dressing, perfect to offset all the turkey I had in the last couple days. It would be nice if the salad dressing is less salty, I should have asked for the salad dressing to be on the side."}
{"text":"Food plated nicely but lacking flavor. Had the prime rib...Bland and lacking any seasoning. Won't be back, disappointing."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for two on a Friday evening, but when we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty.  It did fill up somewhat as we sat, but I would've expected this type of restaurant to be busier at this time of the week.

We ordered the prime rib off the prix fixe menu, which came with a choice of appetizer (soup, Caesar salad, or house salad) and dessert (brownie with ice cream or crème brûlée).  Although we didn't order them, there were also other entrees on the menu that seemed good (including a fish option and a vegetarian option).

The bread that came to our table was nice and warm, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, and somehow the butter was really delicious and didn't taste like regular butter.

The soup was a butternut squash soup, and it was also quite good.  I didn't think about it at the time, but in retrospect, I'd recommend going light on the fresh cracked pepper the server will offer you; I asked for a bit too much and it overpowers the soup.

The prime rib came with choice of a side (I opted for the russet mash, which had an interesting nutty taste, and was definitely very creamy), and creamy horseradish.  I don't know if it was the knife I was given or something else, but I found it difficult to cut through the meat, although it tasted like how prime rib should be (both in texture and flavour).

The brownie and ice cream were good, but too sweet for my liking.  The brownie itself was very rich (think super chocolatey), and they drizzled it with quite a bit of caramel.  The ice cream tamed it somewhat, but I ended up having to leave most of the brownie on my plate because of the excessive sweetness.

The service was a bit slow, although each staff member was definitely very nice when they did make their way to the table.  The good thing about that is that you never felt rushed.

As it was getting closer to winter, I had a heftier jacket with me than I would otherwise have.  I noticed that there were no coat hooks, nor did I see any sort of coat check or anyplace to put my jacket, so when we were seated at a two-person table (booth-style seating) I ended up having to sit with my purse and jacket taking up half my seat.  It made eating my meal a little less comfortable than I would've liked.  It would've been very easy for them to have added a hook on the side of each booth to accommodate this, and I'm surprised they hadn't thought about this.

Overall, there are some improvements that I would want to see if I go again, but it's still not a bad place to go if you have a bit more time on your hands."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business. I had not had lunch and while walking past Canyon Chop House decided to stop in and have an early dinner. Very pleasantly surprised to find a very inviting atmosphere.  I was seated promptly and the wait staff - Alejandro and Alanna were excellent. I have a habit, if I am undecided between two different entrees, to let the waiter decide for me. In this case I could not decide between the Meatloaf, and the BBQ Ribs. Alejandro whole heartedly suggested the Ribs. They were awesome. 

Would definitely go again if ever back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was quite satisfied with everything.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  My glass of water never went below half, which I like.  The food was fantastic.  The chicken chop was backed perfectly and was very moist and tender.  The honey glazed angus short ribs were out of this world.  My only gripe is that the portions didn't really match up to the price.  I felt there could have been a little bit more."}
{"text":"I think I'm just not the steakhouse type.  The service was slow, slow, slow--we had a reservation for seven, but our table wasn't ready until 7:30 because the previous party hadn't cleared out.  If their food took as long to arrive as ours did, I guess that makes sense--it felt like our waiter took a break after every single course.  (The waiter delivered our wine without waiting for our appetizer orders, then took our appetizer orders without asking about our entrees. When we finally ordered our entrees, we had to flag him down separately to order wine to go with dinner.)

My steak was good, but the appetizers were mediocre (the calamari had more breading than seafood and the spinach dip was the same cheesy goop that every generic steakhouse seems to serve).  It wasn't a hardship to spend hours over dinner with good friends, but I really wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with consistently reliable service and food quality. The prices are very reasonable for a place in the heart of downtown Toronto. Went for supper and had a great time. Food came out on time and service was very attentive. Sign up for the newsletter."}

{"text":"Fantastic service considering how busy the restaurant was! Food came quickly and was still hot. Everything was delicious. Asian nachos was extremely flavourful. Canyon dip was good although slightly bland. All the portions were a great size for sharing. The goat cheese chicken penne was by far the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fine dinning evening at Canyon Creek. We were delighted with the food. It was delicious . Our server Kenny was amazing, kind and attentive. It was our first time at this restaurant but not the last . We will recommend it to family and friends. The prime rib, steak and lobster mash were incredible . The desserts of molten chocolate and creme brûlée are new favorites."}
{"text":"I always go to The Keg for steak and wine but our friends convinced us to try Canyon Creek.  With hesitation we went and now I have a new favorite steak joint.

First off I love the ambiance.  When we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces and then were promptly sat our booth. 
Our server who's name was also Scott acknowledge out presence with a smile and said he would be with us shortly. He was correct. Scott greeted us and listed of the specials and his recommendations.  As a large person myself, it's refreshing to get an honest recommendations from another \"large\" person. 
Since I was at a steakhouse I chose to get, you guessed it, a steak. Not just any steak . A peppercorn steak with mash potatoes. 
Our drinks came quick . Then came the best part. Bread and butter with honey in it..delicious! 
Our table received all our food and the most important part began..eating.
My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was juicy and flavourful especially because mine was peppercorn. 
Our server asked how I liked his recommendation and made sure that our needs were met. (Great server). Other servers came by time to time to grab empty plates and glasses to make sure our table was clean and clear. 
Our deserts were Cheesecake and a Brownie with ice cream. We shared 2 desserts between 4 people. 
The meal was exactly want I wanted and executed perfectly in my eyes. 

I will be coming back to Canyon Creek. So many other items I need to try."}
{"text":"Great food,  Good service, good price for a date night. I would come back here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Rating:  2.5 stars

Canyon Creek is on my go-to list for decent meals, but we usually frequent the Front Street location.

I had lunch here and the experience is quite different from my Front St. location visits.  Although the primary menu is available all times, they do have a lunch menu.  Both of us ordered sandwiches that were on the menu.  To my surprise, although tasty, my fried chicken sandwich was only at room temperature, whereas I would have expected the chicken itself to at least be somewhat warm.  I asked my dining companion about his meal (if I recall, it was a burger) and he said it tasted fine but was not hot.

Not sure if this is because we were at the very start of the lunch rush, and they had prepped some meals ahead of time?  I had upgraded to yam fries to accompany my sandwich, and these were piping hot.

This could be a one-off experience;  I've been to this location before (mostly for dinner) and have not had issues with their food, incl. the temperature of the food.  However, this lunch visit was not that great."}
{"text":"2.5 stars (for this visit)

This is a Canyon Creek location I frequent.  I've always had good meals and good service here.  But my most recent visit was not up to expectations - I'll chalk it up as an \"off\" visit, and will not abandon ship just yet.  But I do indeed hope it's a one-off!

We arrived at an odd time - 430pm, wanting an early dinner since we had skipped lunch.  As Club members, we had just received an email offering a free Salted Dark Chocolate ganache with the purchase of an entree.  This enticed us sufficiently to choose Canyon Creek.

Since it was an odd time, I did find that I stood at the front for approx 5 minutes before a hostess was in sight.  It was Family Day, so the restaurant was a somewhat busy despite the unusual hour.  A server came quickly to take drink orders, and we were ready to place a food order when he returned.  He told us bread was not immediately available, as it was still in the oven, and that he'd bring some along when it was ready.  We didn't mind, as this meant fresh baked bread!  It did take some time, but our patience was rewarded.

I had ordered the large 14oz prime rib.  I asked for it to be \"as rare as possible\", but  acknowledged that with prime rib, they often don't have any very rare cuts.  My friend ordered the 10oz at medium rare.  We also ordered a side of mushrooms, and I had a ceasar salad.  

While eating the ceasar salad, our prime rib entrees were served.  The server also quickly returned to ask if everything was OK. Since I was still having my salad, I did not check my prime rib just then.  Once I finished my salad, I cut into my prime rib, and saw that the meat was WELL DONE - not even a hint of pink to be seen.  Ack!  It took forever to flag down the server (they seemed short-staffed), and he said he would replace the dish.  When he returned, he came with a slightly pink cut, stating that this was as rare as they had - I would qualify the doneness as medium to medium-well.  This is a real DISAPPOINTMENT, as I've never had problems at Canyon Creek before even when requesting \"as rare as possible\" for their prime rib.  My friend's \"medium rare\" order was more like medium / medium well with just a hint of pink.  We're not sure but are guessing perhaps this is a prime rib from lunch hour, that sat under a heat lamp?  We did hear later during our meal as another party ordered prime rib that prime rib would not be ready for another half hour.  So yeah...we definitely got the end of the last roast.

I had ordered the large prime rib with the intention of having left overs - now I'm not looking forward to having the left overs, since warming up my medium-well prime rib will make it even more well-done than I like.  Sigh...

As I said, one of the reasons we chose to dine at Canyon Creek was the offer of the free dessert Salted Dark Chocolate ganache.  When we inquired about it, the server had no idea what we were talking about, and looked at us in disbelief and confusion.  He (probably not intentionally) made us feel like we were trying to scam him.  But he did say he would inquire, and sure enough, we were each served this dessert on his return.  The restaurant should make sure staff is up-to-date on current promotions.  Fortunately, we had the emails on our phones, in case it came to that.

So lesson learned here?  Do not come at a \"strange\" hour if you're looking for rare to medium-rare prime rib;  you'll likely be served what was made for lunch, and kept warm (getting more well done by the minute).  Come later in the evening, and the prime rib should be just right.  At least we've been fortunate in many past visits never to have run into over-cooked prime rib by visiting during the evenings.

Being one of my favourite Canyon Creek locations, we'll still come back and give it another chance.  Let's hope this visit was a one-off!"}
{"text":"Took my mother for dinner last night.  Not my first time here but I was disappointed this time.  Ordered the prime rib.  It was tough and chewy.  The pork chop was also tough and flavourless.  For the price ($200+ for 3 of us) I expected better.

If you want prime rib I would recommend crossing the road to Milestones where we had to die for prime rib last week!"}
{"text":"Good value, staff was great, food was great. Had a group of nine with 5 kids, gave us the private room and were very accommodating and fast.

I've had the prime rib here many times and it's always very good."}
{"text":"Came here after a 12 day cleanse with some good friends for RIBS! 

Great start to the evening. We got there at 8:15 and because of our reservations, we were at our table within 5 minutes. Glad that there were hooks behind our big booth to hang our jackets! Once everyone was settled, our waitress came and took our drink orders. When she came back, we were ready to order. 4 out of 6 of us got their ribs. 1 got the fish tacos and 1 got the steak. We also ordered 2 appetizers.

They provided us with a small loaf of bread with their amazing honey butter. (I can probably just eat bread with that butter all night) Our appetizers came pretty quickly. I shared the avocado and bacon salad with a friend. Tbh, it was good but not worth the $9. There were slices of avocado, grape tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions and feta. We were expecting more from a salad. 

Our entrees came. The steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare. The fish tacos where great. Their fully loafed baked potatoes were piled with goodness. The ribs were fantastic! However, my friend found a piece of hair on her ribs. We had orders a full rack and shared it. She was on her last piece of rib when she pulled a hair out of her mouth. Needless to say, I stopped half way through my ribs even though I was seriously craving it. 

The manager came over and was very apologetic and informed us that they were sorry and explained that all their cook staff wear hair nets and etc. Please keep in mind that my friend and I weren't angry at this situation. Things happen. The manager comped our ribs and desserts. In the end we only had to pay for the appetizer. 

Overall, we had a good experience. Would I go there for ribs again? Hells yeah! The employees there are nice and courteous. The washroom are clean and they have awesome bartenders. :)"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend and sat on the patio, we were served by a petite asian server (whose name I don't remember as I am horrible with names). She was extremely sweet and personable, she made awesome recommendations and showed a genuine interest in us and our needs. I came with my boyfriend and my cousin who was visiting from Vancouver. Despite being busy our server ensured that our drinks were always refilled and even came by to ensure that a bug did not fly into them (as were were sitting on the patio and our first drink had a fruit fly go into it). Our server was also really patient and we never felt rushed, as we took our time and order things slowly off the menu. I could tell that she really wanted us to have a good time rather than flip our table quickly which as I have worked in the restaurant industry know can be an issue with some servers. We order the chicken tacos to share, then had the garlic shrimp ravioli and a steak. The food was fantastic but our service was the highlight of the experience. We will be definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again last night for a drink and a small bite to eat. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio...I don't remember which one, I just know it's the more expensive one on the menu and it's yummy.  And my hubby ordered more of Steve's Mojitos. 

We ordered the Golden Calamari.  It is fried in a chili buttermilk batter and served with a garlic aioli. The were cooked perfectly and and were delicious!

After the app I opted to try the Molten Chocolate Cake.  At first I wasn't sure because of the basil creme anglaise but boy am I glad I branched out. The chocolate cake was deliciously moist and was well complimented by the basil creme anglaise. It came with vanilla bean ice cream in a candy tuille basket and was garnished with a crispy basil leaf. I got three basil leafs and popped one in my mouth as soon as it was put down in front of me. I was going to just move them to the side but my husband made the suggestion to eat one of the leaves with a bite of the ice cream. Wow!  I highly recommend you try this. I ate the last two leaves this way and then wished I had crumbled them up and sprinkled them all over the ice cream. The candy tuille basket tastes like the inside of a Skor bar and when you take a bite of the candy, ice cream, and chocolate cake it's just heaven in your mouth!  I will definitely be having this dessert again!

As always, we had a great time and were served by our favourite bartender, Steve. I hope you get to meet him the next time you're in."}
{"text":"We deliberately went here at an off time to enjoy a quiet meal.  Sadly, even though we were literally the only people in the restaurant, they sat the only other two tables as close to us as possible so we were surrounded with loud talkers and kids.  Why, when there's so much space, do you insist on cramming people together like livestock?  
The steak was raw and the Cobb salad underwhelming.  The bread was moderately tasty, though."}
{"text":"This location in particular is outstanding. My husband I have been frequenting this CCSC for the last several years and have NEVER had a disappointing meal.  The lunchtime cooking crew is specifically amazing. 
New lunch time items are very innovative as well as well executed."}
{"text":"Does service make a meal no but in this case it certainly did. The manager is a young spunky girl with a keen sense of customer service. The wine is marginal but the penfolds is a solid go to red for the whole staff. When I wasn't quite pleased with a dish they weren't satisfied with my passive aggressive \"its fine\". Instead they rolled forward with changing things out for me.  What a wonderful experience and really isn't that why we go out to have a great experience."}
{"text":"Came with 6 girlfriends on Saturday night. We had good time. Nice service. We stayed for at least 5 hours their talking and they didn't try to get us out even when they were closing. Was pleasant, because many places let you know when it is time to leave. Food was good. I think everyone liked their dish. Lobster guacamole was a hit. I think they can improve desserts. I found them a little too simple in taste."}
{"text":"Felt rushed. Appetizer came in a matter of seconds. My main arrived two mins later, I had hardly started my salad, so my steak sat there until I was done. Might be a great in-and -out lunch spot..."}
{"text":"I think this might have to replace my current date night restaurant, Milestones.

The second time i went, the service was AMAZING, food was delicious, everything was just fabulous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, ambient setting,  music and lighting.  Food was done right.  Chipotle steak was prepared right.  Friendly servers."}
{"text":"Went to Canyon Creek before the Leafs game. Service was poor and slow. Meals were warm not hot. Complaining to the manager got me \"so what do you want me to do about it\" . No buddy thats not the approach. Never going back and thats what I told him. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had spent a long day running errands and buying groceries and prep materials for a charity event. We had taken the bus to go to the party city and dollarama beside Sherway gardens and were exhausted and starving as we were hauling around giant Costco bags and walking from store to store. When we entered the canyon creek hoping to enjoy a meal after a long day, the host REFUSED to let us eat at the restaurant and told us to leave. We were extremely frustrated as we do not own cars and had to haul our bags full of charity event supplies around the Sherway area and on the TTC. The woman and the manager were extremely rude and dismissed us simply because we had larger bags. I felt extremely judged by the staff and management as they turned us away. It made me realize how discriminatory some restaurants can be and how good service is often dependent on customer visual profiling."}
{"text":"My friends and I had the burgers. They were like grease balls. Really full of oil and the portions was quite small. For $16 it was definitely not worth it. And the fries are small as fuck. I give the meal a 4.5/10"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch or dinner! Priced like a steakhouse but food is much better than the keg or others in my opinion. I love their unique sauces (horseradish sourcream, honey butter, etc!) wonderful atmosphere and good food! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was quite good - got a burger with delicious skinny fries. 

Very nice ambiance (sort of dimly lit/romantic).

I went twice and had friendly, attentive servers both times. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Embarrassing Waste of Money - Visit was on Jan 7, 2017, Server ID - 200172, Check# 649307, Table#74 - To make a long story short, I recently got engaged and we decided to take our families out for a nice dinner to celebrate. We made a reservation for 10 People which worked out fine because we were seated on time. However, our server was rude, didn't even introduce himself. He seemed in a hurry all the time and did not give us the time of day. He was MIA most of the night and it was difficult to get a hold of him for anything. One of my guests happen to asked if pop refills were complimentary and he was rudely told/asked \"If it IS, then do you want one?\". It took lots of work in order to get other drinks refilled e.g. water and we had to hunt down our server each time to ask! We also asked for \"regular\" butter which took about 3 quarters into the meal to arrive, by that time we didn't need it it anymore. It also didn't help that my mother decided that she would take care of the bill. Being older, she messed up on their credit card machine and forgot to include tip, which promptly asked about (she gave him cash as tip and asked for a bit of change back). He made an asshole move by giving her back a pile of nickels and dimes.... (we have people at the table that have industry knowledge, and this is usually only done when the server hates their guests). Personally, he deserved no tip at all. My parents don't eat out often, and they are still wondering why anyone would pay so much money for such garbage. This is the last time that any of us will set foot into a Canyon Creek and we will make sure no one we know makes this same mistake."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner before a concert. Our server was extremely nice and attentive, and made sure our food got out quickly so that we could be on time. I'm vegetarian and they were able to make the asian tacos without the chicken. It was delicious! I highly recommend stopping here for some drinks and food."}
{"text":"I've been to Canyon Creek about three times and all three times I have ordered their Prime Rib. What can I say, they do Prime Rib well -- medium rare, not a lot of gristle and just enough fat. Unfortunately each time I have gone with friends, they did not enjoy their mains as much. For example their steak was apparently \"ok\" and wasn't as flavorful as the Keg's. Their desserts aren't anything special and any dessert I can hardly remember probably wasn't worth it. Their service is ok. Our last waiter was really helpful and funny, unfortunately the food did take quite a noticeable while to get to our table. If The Keg is fully-booked or closed, this is my next go-to place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I come here for the skinny fries, always. Prime rib is a good choice, or any of their steaks in general. Chocolate brownie was surprisingly good. Highly recommend this place if you want a good steak at a moderate price."}
{"text":"I went on a date here not too long ago, and I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. what stopped me was the wait... and the service. I made reservations and still I had to wait such a long time. The waiter that I had constantly messed up our orders. Ordered a ginger ale, gave me Pepsi... asked for Pepsi, got a watered down Pepsi...promised to bring our complimentary bread, never got the bread. He definitely didn't receive a tip. I ordered the bacon burger with a side of fries, and despite the amateur service, it was the best burger I have ever eaten. Definitely would recommend this restaurant but prepare for terrible service. The restaurant was very packed but was surprisingly very quiet so it's great for a date of a night out with your friends."}
{"text":"Always good, consistent service.  Price is fair."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. Really good food. Delicious drinks and deserts and a very nice atmosphere. We tried the Asian nachos and the lettuce wrap for appetizers. Both were very good. We have so far tried the tandoori spiced grilled chicken salad, the Chipotle sirloin, the peppercorn steak and the pan roasted salmon. I can honestly say they were all very delicious. We've also tried the molten chocolate cake and it is excellent."}
{"text":"Listen!! The prime rib steaks were perfection! Like butter! 
The thing is, my mom and I would have never thought to come here had it not been for this cool gift card that arrived in the mail ($25 off a $50 purchase).
The meal was topped off with a heavenly double chocolate brownie. One of our servers, John, was very pleasant and helpful (our other server, not so much, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). We highly recommend steak dinners here."}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered our steaks medium. Her's came back medium and mine was medium rare to rare. Waiter kept calling my aunt \"dear\" which she didn't care for. Overall a really nice place but I've had a better steak at the Keg.."}
{"text":"The chicken goat cheese penne was awful!  Noodles were over cooked and chicken tastes as though it had been microwaved.  

My wife's ribs were terrible, too dry and the sauce was not even remotely good. 

Service was very good though.  I would not recommend this place to anyone as good quality has really gone since I was here last (2 yrs ago)."}
{"text":"Only the atmosphere. Food is as good as any other Western place. Went for my Birthday and it was good but nothing exceptional. Had steak and fried calamari."}
{"text":"I was staying at one of the area hotels last night and walked over to canyon creek to avoid hotel food...but I got hotel food at a restaurant.  Ordered a peppercorn filet and got something that looked like a ribeye covered with ground black pepper out of a mccormicks container and then cheap gravy with 4 peppercorns covering it.  Veggies were literally 3 asparagus stalks and 2 slices of carrots.  Ordered canyon dip (described as basically spinach artichoke dip) and had a runner drop off tortilla chips and a dish half filled with salsa and the other half something that looked like guacamole.  We ate it but had no idea if it was what we ordered.  Perhaps just an off night?"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice restaurant to celebrate 3 birthday with my mother who lives 2 hours away and Vaughan is in the middle.   My husband who works close by and has always heard good things about Canon Creek was the most unimpressed.  I called 3 weeks a head to make early dinner reservations for my stepfather, who is handicapped, my mother, 9 year daughter, 6 month old son, my husband and myself.   Telling them who was coming and asking about Children's menus and high chairs, I thought I picked a good restaurant but, I was wrong.

When we arrived we were treated well and followed (I think the manager) to our table and asked what we wanted to drink.  Having to situated my son I said just water for now.  The high chair was just one of those wooden chairs, which my son was unable to sit in.  We then needed to ask for a kids menu for my daughter.  No one ever asked me for my drink order again.  

We all ordered off the pre-set menu.  Mushroom soup was amazing, but my bowl was taken before I could finish.   My Steak was amazing, but there was no vegetables. My husband said the roast beef had no flavor.  

Dessert came and there was no offer of tea or coffee, I was still drinking my water, which never emptied. 

Leaving I was extremely disappointed, maybe if we didn't have the kids it would have been better, but looking around there were lots of other kids there,  and I asked when making reservation about children."}
{"text":"used to love their old canyon creek dip with the tomato salsa, definitely don't like the new one. Interior is dark and dingy but overall a quite place compared to pubs in the area"}
{"text":"This (and any other Canyon Creek location) is our go to chain restaurant for casual fine dining. Love the rotating menu and friendly staff. Oddly enough, I also like the dim lighting although I don't care for that in other restaurants! My wife enjoyed a tabasco free caesar and I had a Mexican Yucatan margarita with our lunch today. The margarita was nice and spicy due to the added jalapeno bits. Beef stew was not hearty enough and a bit watery and salad was standard. Southern fried chicken sandwich with jalapeno and cole slaw aioli was OFF THE HOOK. Love the soft bun. Well that says a lot now doesn't it. Garden salad instead of fries to balance out the health a bit. Glad our waitress was efficient because there was a large group seated at the same time but we didn't have to wait long at all. Service was quick and we were done in about 40 minutes. Looking forward to next time. When in doubt, go with the prime rib."}
{"text":"Birthday Party reservations for 8 and 12 people showed up for dinner, so we had to wait a little for a bigger table to be available, no big deal to us and didn't appear to be for the staff either.  When we were seated for dinner we ordered drinks and glasses  of water came right away along with the bread & honey-butter (YUM!).  Dinner was served pretty quickly considering the size of our group, most had steak dinners and nobody was complaining about the quality or quantity.  Every person who was working that night was friendly and courteous despite if we were in their 'section' or not!  The entire experience and great service gets 5stars!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on our way to the Jacks next door when we decided to try Canyon Creek instead. I can happily say Im happy we did that. I Loved the food at Canyon Creek !! The chipotle steak was absolutely amazing! The service was great as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and wait staff were top notch.  The food was hit and miss.

We ordered the scallops wrapped with bacon and they were delicious.  The chop house salad was out of this world. This meal was looking very positive to this point.

I ordered surf and turf and my filet came out medium well (ordered medium rare) and my loaded baked potato was cold, although the lobster was divine.  My wife's grilled salmon was overcooked and so was my son's sirloin steak.  I sent my steak and potato back and the manager came to our table and offered us a glass of wine on the house (what we were drinking).  A nice gesture, but really missed the mark.  We were having a pleasant dinner and they mostly ruined it (for a pretty expensive meal)."}
{"text":"Their $5 happy hour deal in the bar area is cheating customers. On the menu, it said '$5 for appertizer and beverage' and when the bill came, it showed $5 for the appertizer and $5 for the drink and the total is $10. When we asked the server, he said it is $5 each.

We don't mind paying but hate to be cheated. We will never give our business to restaurant that do business by cheating."}
{"text":"I had a meeting cancelled on a Friday afternoon so decided to meet a friend for lunch near the airport since he was nearby .  Thus was my first time at this location.  My friend and I used to visit the location by Square One fairly regularly since it was near a client we had.  In any event, I didn't order anything to really write about, as we shared the fish tacos, and I added a Caesar Salad, and a shared bottle of Cab.  The service was prompt and friendly, and this location has a great \"solarium\" type room that is mainly open air, but is covered and is cool, so if is very comfortable when the sun is strong."}
{"text":"The service was great, the waitress we had was very friendly, polite, hospitable and accommodating. The establishment itself is clean, looks and feels to serve for upper class clientele but can be versatile for casual get togethers, family dinners or romantic dates. The ambiance is perfect and food arrived to the table in a timely manner. However, the food lackluster and I was slightly underwhelmed. I came here around lunch and ordered from their lunch \"discounted\" menu which I personally thought was still on the pricier side. Their options were very limited and once the food came out quantity and taste wise I didn't think it was worth the price or the hype. I ordered the pasta and my partner ordered the Spicy Chicken Bowl. The pasta was good but for the price I feel I could have gone elsewhere cheaper for better quality food. My partner knew the spicy chicken bowl was obviously going to have a kick however didn't know the severity of the spice level. The waitress failed to mention or warn us that this is not for the mild to average spice lovers. This dish can actually become quite unpalatable if you don't truly love or handle spice and the spice actually eventually overpowered the entire dish. The desert was delicious, yet once again for the price and quality I was slightly disappointed. I do have to say though it isn't awful and I will be coming back yet it probably won't be my first choice of places."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers for lunch as we work in the area. This is your typical downtown restaurant - very similar to most others in the area. Food was good (had the burger which was nicely done), prompt and attentive service and decent prices. The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is that it doesn't differentiate itself in any way from the standard downtown eatery in any way."}
{"text":"Generous wine pours, steak cooked perfectly. Bonus: Michelle the bar tender called me \"Love\", as in \" What can I get ya, Love?\".   Great music piping in. Not too loud, good variety."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our first meal when we arrived in Toronto. We booked through OpenTable and got 1,000 points for our reservation!

The bread and butter is probably some of the best I've ever had. For a drink I had the foxy lady (Hendrick's Gin, Mediterranean tonic, fresh strawberry, English cucumber, mint bitters, rose water) which was very good. My boyfriend and I shared the bandera chicken tacos (Chili marinated, roasted chicken on corn tortillas, with fresh guacamole, charred tomato salsa, shredded red cabbage, queso blanco, and Valentina crema) and the sesame sirloin salad (Grilled top sirloin, fresh greens, roma tomatoes, goat cheese, sugared pecans, with sweet chili teriyaki dressing and crisp wontons). The tacos were tasty but had to be eaten with a fork. We ordered the salad since the steak was recommended to us by our waitress. The salad was probably one of the best we've ever had and the steak on it was very good.

We would definitely come back again if we lived there."}
{"text":"Food was terrible for Winterlicious - the only decent thing was the soup, I didn't even finish the main course and I could not take another bite after the first of the dessert. 
Service was not the greatest, they did not let me choose how I wanted my steak. 
The place is alright looking, nothing special. 
I felt terrible for taking my dad there for his birthday, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Canyon Creek is one of the best steakhouse I've been to in years. The staff was very friendly, and would stop by my table often to ask about the food.

  I had the coffee crusted steak; it was very soft and tender, and the sides were fantastic as well.  Unfortunately, I fished out a small hair in the onion crisps. The manager and server handled the situation very professionally, with free desserts for the entire table.  They also gave us a new,  full side of onion crisps. (which were also delicious. ) 

Overall, everything was great!!  :)"}
{"text":"We had reservations and were seated early, but we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. Apparently they had a bit of a mix up on who was going to service our table. Me and my family were irritated because of the wait, but our server apologized and gave us 3 free appetizers! He was very courteous and immediately made our experience 100 times better. 

I had the top sirloin steak and it was pretty good, but my sister had the chicken and it was very dry. The mashed potatoes are really good, but the best thing we had was probably the lobster guacamole with chips. 

Overall it's a bit overpriced, but the customer service was great."}
{"text":"Your hungry...interested in a nice meal, but don't want the regular Jack Astor's, Casey's or Montana's? Enter Canyon Creek Steak & Chop! The decor is nice, definitely the Keg meets Milestones'. The lighting is dim, and inviting for diner for two, or a nice group meal.  I had the herbed chicken with mashed potatoes...Can you say fulling! The brownie for desert was a wonderfully delicious way to have the whole diet crash and burn. My companion had the New York Steak medium well, and for those of you who can appreciate that fine line between well done and medium with pink' Canyon Creek is definitely on the ball! The waiter was friendly, attentive, and efficient' just how I like em!! The overall feeling was definitely worth repeating."}
{"text":"I was at Canyon Creek on Friday to meet up with friends.  I found out that they were participating Winterlicious and figured that we give them a try.  3 courses for $25, you really cannot go wrong with that price!

The food was great, the usual expected fare from a chain restaurant.  The ceasar was dressed and seasoned perfectly.  My salmon entree was delicious, there was an excessive amount of rice pilaf as my side.  I loved loved the brownie dessert.  It was a great way to end a meal.

Service was top-notch.  Our waitress was attentive.  We did not feel rushed having our meal.

Overall, it was a wonderful evening with great food and service.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I probably should have read the reviews first... It's a very good location near the town center which drove or decision to try it. We were seated very quickly on the patio on a Thursday night. The staff and service were excellent throughout the evening. We all went for various versions of sirloin steak. I personally went for the Chipotle version. All the steaks were done as requested but they had to be toughest stringiest things I have ever had the misfortune to see in a restaurant in a couple of decades. The Chipotle butter did redeem it slightly but overall a huge disappointment. The bread with maple butter was outstanding and dinner could have ended there. There is a good beer selection and the decor a bit tired so be warned."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night, I got a card in the mail for a coupon, so I thought we should check it out! Server was nice yet very talkative. I ordered steak as did my boyfriend, I told her I was gluten free. My food came and had onion sticks that were deep fried. She realized this as I put them on my bfs plate (I hate making a fuss about this), she apologized and asked if I wanted a new plate. We were in a rush so I told her it was fine. The steak I ordered came out well done versus medium. I told her and they re did it. She also knew we were in a rush but it took quite long to get the machine. Overall, I thought my experience here would be better as I thought the company was doing something different with the coupons."}
{"text":"A pretty room with pricey mediocre food. Seems corporate."}
{"text":"I came here Sunday evening for dinner. It wasn't busy at all, probably because of the Black Friday weekend. My friend and I ordered the calamari to start, we thought that it was really well made. For our mains we got the chicken penne and southwest chicken. For the price we were paying, we found that the portion was very small. The mains were just okay, nothing amazing, could probably eat better elsewhere for the same price. Bill came up to about $60."}
{"text":"You think you're better than chain restaurants? I bet you do. I got news for you, brother. Y'AINT.

My favourite steak to eat (that isn't maddeningly expensive) is the Chipotle Sirloin at Canyon Creek. This dude is $24 damn dollars. And it is beautiful. There's this goat cheese butter melted on top of it and the meat appears as though it went swimming in a spicy little sauce (that you shouldn't ask for extra of 'cause it'll ruin it, I've lived and learned) for hours. Every time I go back to Canada for a visit, I eat this at least once. It's heavenly. (Also, one last note: the Caesar salad is crazy. Like, outrageously good.)

The restaurant in general is great, but this piece of meat is wonderful. Unfortunately I do not possess the vocabulary necessary to accurately explain how scrumptious this dish is. So maybe go and see for yourself? Really, go. Tell me I'm wrong! (Sidenote: if you tell me I'm wrong, be prepared for a lengthy discussion on why you're not intelligent.) 

MEAT!"}
{"text":"Went back again for my 30th birthday, and the experience was (just about ) as stellar as last time.

I ended up going for the seafood linguine off the winter menu. While I'm not necessarily a fan of how messy the whole thing is (it's extremely difficult to get a forkful of pasta and twist it on a spoon because of how much sauce is in it), the end result was very flavourful and the scallops were a particular highlight. Most of our group settled on the pan-seared chicken, which (based on the bit I tried) is bursting with goodness and is topped with a generous helping of salsa verde.

Not only did we have a prime spot (right next to the fireplace), but the cake we brought in (bought itself) was chilled and served at just the right time.

If I have a minor quibble, our server was apparently more smitten with a couple who had come in and sat near us and brought their child. While I normally wouldn't care either way, the service wasn't as good as previous times we were here, and we had to wait a couple of times to get dishes bussed out or ask for something that wasn't immediately delivered. Then again, that's the whole \"premium casual dining\" experience I talked about in my original review.

Besides that, fantastic experience as always."}
{"text":"Up until midway through my meal, I was ready to grade this as a two-star experience, but lo and behold, Canyon Creek knocked it out of the park once again.

I hadn't been to this location previously, although I had visited the Canyon Creek up by Roy Thomson Hall several times before. Finding the Front Street location was a bit of a trick, as it seems to be down a small stairway off the street and can be easily missed if you're not paying attention.

Things got off to a shaky start when we had to wait quite a long time for service. Though we were well aware that it was going to be busy (this was just after a Jays game, which we had just come from as well), there was a good half-hour lull between the time the waitress brought out drinks and the time she came to take our orders. Not to mention that one of my friends got a sticky glass for their beer (we're assuming they handled it after making a mixed drink), and we were a bit surprised that other groups were coming and going before us.

But boy, did they sure come through big once our orders were taken. I had a Garden Burger with a Caesar salad. That just might be the best veggie burger I've ever had. You almost couldn't tell that it wasn't real meat. Packed full of toppings and dripping like no tomorrow, it had me stuffed and satisfied by the end of it.

Half our group also had the prix-fixe menu, and what I tried from them (the garden salad, the pan-seared salmon and the creme brulee, the last of which was given to me because one of our members had to leave early) was all on point and flavorful.

We also had a... special discount, which came in very handy at the end of the meal and knocked off a substantial portion of the bill. I realize it shouldn't factor into my experience, but I'm pointing it out all the same.

They also have a weird habit of putting way too much ice in their soft drinks. It was hardly more than a small cup's worth of actual soda, and a good two-thirds ice. I had to tell the waitress that I wanted no ice in my drink, which she argued a little about but eventually acquiesced to. Tone your ice game down, please.

This location is a worthy successor to the King Street CC I visited in the past, and besides a couple little points (mainly, handling crowd flow on busy days), I'll definitely be coming back in the near future. One of my new favorite restaurants at the south end of the city.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancé for a pre Valentine's Day treat, we got in with no reservations and enjoyed a lovely meal! 

My fiancé ordered the 8 oz prime rib with mashed russet potatoes, and I had the salmon salad. For dessert we had the molten brownie cake. Needless to say we were really satisfied. We actually came here because I was given a gift certificate from the GM for the location on Front St in Toronto. I had planned some holiday parties there, and as a a Thank you they gave me a gift certificate. 

The service at this location was great, a girl named Carolyn helped us and she was attentive the whole time without being over bearing. The food was solid as it always is across all canyon creeks. 

Definitely a must if you wanna skip cooking dinner for the day and have a solid meal with great service then this is your place! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Second visit to this place since there are very few options on Airport Rd by Pearson. First experience wasn't that great, steak was served rare when I ordered medium. You'd think a steak place would get that right!  What brought me back was the sample of Asian Nachos I had on that visit. Something really different; just the right combo of crunchy, spicy, and sweet. Enough for a meal when paired with a salad. They brought me back and I will come again!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Canyon Creek while traveling for business.  We brought a very large party and found the entire staff to be friendly and helpful and the food to be great.  Keith and Shamis worked with us to make sure the party went well.  We couldn't have been happier.  Top notch place and staff."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced, I remember canyon creek being on the same par as keg, but unfortunately this particular location looks like a Swiss chalet from the inside.

But it doesn't stop there, I had the steak and shrimp 'chef' signature dish but it really had no flavour whatsoever ... Add to that, they served with plain steamed rice and boiled veggies. I would expect menu items to be paired properly but the rice complemented none of the little flavour the steak and shrimp had so I just didn't understand. 

The restaurant was saved by a decent bar selection including a rich, spicy creemore no9 and good service, otherwise I would have been shouting at the manager over my $170 4 adult bill !!! 

Looking at the clientele it seems this place was filled with people not really enjoying food, but more so playing around with half eaten plates and drinking.

Desert cheesecake  was a piece of dried up sponge cake so it might have been over baked ... Errrr or just 'bought' a while ago :) cookies with the kids meals where supposed to be soft chic chip ... But more like ginger snaps even the kids left them half eaten ! 

This place seems like a default selection if you can't get any other place to eat within walking distance, which I guess why it's popular for tired mall goers and tourists since they probably won't be back. However for localites, I don't need to tell you the gta has lots better to offer and at a more suited price"}
{"text":"My friend and I frequently go to this location for a meal and drinks.  The food is always great and the service is very good.  Yesterday, however, we had some issues with waiting for our food and our meal coming before our starters.  We told our waitress to cancel our starter as we had a movie to get to.  The manager came over and told us the meal was on her.  What??  We told her we weren't that angry but she insisted.  To the manager who was working May 6th thank you very much.  We definitely will continue to visit your restaurant.  Customer service at its best!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night.  It was busy and we were told the wait would be 30 minutes, we decided to wait.  The table was ready in about that amount of time and once we entered the dining room there were actually a huge percentage of empty tables (maybe 30%).  Not sure why we were waiting then but perhaps it was a matter of quality control.

We ordered our food and got our meals about 5 minutes after ordering.   The food was cold,  fries were soft and portions were skimpier than usual.   I almost feel like we got food that was sent back to the kitchen from a different table as the food was barely warm let alone hot.   After we finished eating a table near us got their food, they happened to actually order at the same time we did so it basically confirmed or meals weren't made to order. 

Only reason why I didn't give 1 star is because I've had better experiences at this location before so I'm hoping it was a one time fluke."}
{"text":"Food = 3    Service - 0

At 5:00 we arrived with our group of 5 and were informed that they could seat us but we had to leave by 6:30. That was fine with us.

After getting menus our server (Johnathon?) came to the table with a smile and promptly took our orders. His pleasant manner must have been an attempt to mask his total incompetence.

20 minutes later no water or drinks appeared in spite of asking two different people at least 5 times. Amazingly another server approached our table with a water pitcher but left when she saw we had no glasses. Finally smiley came out with our drinks.

Around 5:45 the food came out. Our friend ordered medium rare prime rib which came out basically raw. She sent it back and it came out raw again just a little darker on the surface.

We never saw our server again until 6:15 when he cleared a couple of plates and left the rest of the mess in front of us. We asked twice for our desserts which smiley kept saying were coming. Finally we flagged another server who took a few dirty dishes away and left the rest.

We left without our desserts. It took so long to get the check that we just paid and left."}
{"text":"Went to Mississauga for business and some friends took my out to eat. 
This place was close the hotel so we decided to give it a try.
The place is nice like a hip bar pretty classy but relax. 
The service was fast and the waitress was super friendly and helpful.
We shared the asian nachos and they were amazing. Wontons with chicken and veggies nice combo and I am glad I tried them. 
Main course I took the fish tacos and I was a bit disappointed. The fish was a bit blend and the filling too juicy so it made it so hard to eat, the tortillas were falling apart. In the end I ate the filling and left the tortillas in the plate.
My friend had a burger and it was so juicy and delicious wish I took the burger as well. 
We also had a few beer and mine had a lemon taste and I really enjoyed it.
I cant wait to go back and this time I will try the steak"}
{"text":"Big Eye Tuna Salad! Add Tabasco and you have got the perfect tasty quick lunch. Fast great service!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in Scarborough. We went there on New Year's Eve for dinner and were by happy with our choice. I have been at this restaurant couple of times and every time I am happy with my food and service. I found there coconut chirps are amazing: fresh and crispy with funky dipping sauce. I had asiago cheese/mushroom burger, which was very fresh and juicy. Mushrooms and cheese added a nice kick to it. 
Service was great. Very friendly ...."}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars*

Wow this place was PACKED Saturday night. Who would have thought this Canyon Creek, in a little unassuming plaza beside the gigantic Scarborough Town Centre, would have been the life of the party?!? Reservations are a MUST! My mom, who had booked a table for 8, even received a call earlier Saturday morning to confirm her reservation.

Canyon Creek is a great casual steak place with prices less than The Keg, but more than your average Casey's for steak and meat. My family especially loves the Scarborough location for Canyon Creek, making it convenient for some of our family members to get there. 

There are some new additions to the menu, I had the meatloaf which was so very juicy. No dry piece of soap here. Most of my family had the steak and all finished it without a complaint. We always order the fried calamari for appetizers and that quickly hit the spot. Dessert ordered varied from a solid piece of cheesecake to a Banana cream pie. My bf and I shared a very sticky and sweet Pecan Pie, which I normally don't like, but with a good hot cup of joe, was good.

Wines here a so very decently priced as we ordered a bottle of good flavoured Chianti for $34.

Service needs to be described in two parts here. First, our actual waiter was excellent. Funny, charming to my mom (!!) and very pleasant, so no complaints there. However, our dishes did take some time to get to us and between appetizers and our mains, all the wine was finished. It was an extremely busy night (but still)...our waiter did make sure to let us know that our food was fast approaching.

Overall, no complaints here. Most likely will be back again for another causal family get together.

{"text":"It was my second time there the other night and it was as fantastic as the first.  I took my girlfriend there on our first date and we went back on our anniversary.  The place is way cool and comfortable.  The lights are turned down a little and the mood is layed back and romantic.  At no time do you feel rushed, or ignored when you wanted something.  Right from the start we were greeted with a warm smile and were seated right away. Within moments our drink orders were being taken, by a knowlegeable waitress who helped us pick a great tasting wine.  We both had steaks cooked to our liking, and finished with a pecan pie which was the best I believe I have ever tasted.  

There's not to much negative to say about this place, but it was a Monday evening and I'm sure the place could be quite busy on the weekend so call first to make sure you can be seated.  As well the bill was over $100.00 so you can't do this everynight but if you save it for the right time you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Canyon Creek  a few times now. I usually order the NY or Chicago steak. It's my \"go to\" when dining at a steakhouse. 

I have never had a bad experience at this location. The service has always been good, and the food is always delightful.

The staff here is outstanding. I highly value staff that knows their menu inside and out. It's important for me as a customer to receive details of the menu and recommendations. I always have questions when it comes down to ordering and I'm always pleased to know that the staff is very knowledgeable and are able to provide feedback.  

I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, let alone chain steakhouses but when I do feel like going out for a steak, this is my first and only choice. 

Always a great evening out."}
{"text":"I came here with the parents for a farewell and thanks for everything dinner on my last night in Toronto. They had both been here a couple of times and thought it was an easy option (and relatively inexpensive, considering their little girl was buying!).

So, we went into this really nice restaurant, which was a pleasant surprise considering the neighbourhood is all about outlets and business parks.

There was a great vibe coming from both the outside seating area and the more quiet and family friendly seating inside. 

We were placed in a booth, which seemed to be a bit narrow, and then given our menus.

My parents had suggested the prime rib sandwich as a go to meal, but I wasn't in the mood to be honest. Instead I had the cheeseburger with chips (fries) and shared a side salad with my dad. I also had a pint of Toronto's local Steamwhistle lager, which was quite nice. In fact, I ended up having two pints of that (I wasn't driving!). The burger was tasty, though lacked seasoning. I did like the big piece of pickle, which we don't seem to get here in Ireland. Too many chips for me, but other than that, very nice.

I really enjoyed my sandwich and I could see that the parents were satisfied again with their meal.

The service was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was great. I would totally come back next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Portions very small. They have lot of space for customers but it feels old world. each seating area is next to each other so no privacy. I found portion size too little for the price they charge. I would visit few more times to make a better opinion."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, Canyon Creek was quite decent. I had a delicious prime rib sandwich for lunch and my friend had a steak salad. The beef was cooked exactly as ordered and it was juicy and flavourful. The prix fixe menu looked to be a great deal but we weren't THAT hungry."}
{"text":"Came in with my brother to use the $20 off $50 mailer coupon I've had sitting in my purse for a while and nearly forgot about until the day before it expires. Booked a reservation online through OpenTable, no problems whatsoever with that.

Being a steak lover, I ordered the 10 oz prime sirloin ($30.95) with mashed potatoes. The steak was great; good quality meat, lots of juice, grilled as I asked for it, crispy exterior, melt in your mouth texture, but just slightly not hot enough. The mashed potatoes were good, but I think some gravy would have been great since it did get a bit dry halfway through the meal. Onion crisps and the accompanying greens brought a good balance to the steak and potatoes; really wished there was more of the salad.

Also ordered some parmesan truffle fries ($5) to share. They were light and crispy and tasted good, but I didn't really taste parmesan or truffle, just some rosemary. The complimentary bread at the beginning of the meal was a bit bland but toasted perfectly and came with butter that more resembled buttercream (like on cakes) more than normal butter.

All in all, a satisfactory meal at a satisfactory price (we came up to just under $60 for 2 people). Most of the sides were good, not mind blowingly great, but the steak is what I came for and it was solid. Prices seem to be slightly lower than at other similar establishments, which doesn't hurt. The atmosphere in the part of the restaurant where we sat was dimly lit and very private - perfect for dates or for chatting, though it was not so well suited for taking pictures. I really liked how quiet and cozy it was; very relaxing and low stress compared to other places where the music is so loud you can't have a decent conversation. I'd definitely consider coming back  as I had a great time here on my first visit."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but I had asked for a cake because it was my mom's birthday but the serve must of forgotten towards the end of the meal so we never got it. 

The appetizers were pretty good. I would recommend Asian Nachos and the Prime Rib Sliders."}
{"text":"Was here on jet lag. Welcoming staff, sat me under a sunny place as I requested. Food was fine. Service much to slow when you need to rest!"}
{"text":"The steak was great but it came at a price, arguably not worth the premium. Though the ambience and service is very good, so perhaps the extra cost is associated with the experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in to have dinner 2 nights this week sitting at the bar. The staff was great especially Jamie they made an out of town person feel like a local. The food and drinks were great. I was in on a Wednesday and Thursday I was greeted with a hello Mickey from Jamie. You don't usually have staff remember your name after one visit. Those nights it's $5 off apps. The coconut shrimp Jamie recommend was the best I have ever had. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for dinner this Friday and both dishes were perfection! Our waiter was great, he answered our QAs, and brought warm bread with delicious honey butter-- yum! My bf ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes while I ordered the half rack of ribs with fries and slaw. We received our food within 10-12min of placing our orders. It arrived in no-time! My ribs were fall-off-the-bone good and my bf could not stop raving about his steak. He even said the ribeye made his top 5 list of Best Steaks! The waiter acknowledged Brendan(?) as the chef behind the steak, to which my bf replied \"That guy is going places!\" We had a great time."}
{"text":"You know how bad this place is when 3 waitresses are sitting down eating and telling you good night as you leave. 

The menu is very overpriced for the options and quality of food. The menu is also limited to very few options and not great by any means.  

Ordered the calamari, for 12.50 I got rubbery frozen calamari and it was very small. 

Chicken tacos for around 14 was a joke, dry and tasteless. 

My friend had a steak and \"poached lobster\" but all she got was a piece crumbled pieces of lobster on top of her potatoes....which was probably fake. 

The menue is over priced with cheap cuts of steaks and over all I would say save your money and go toThe Keg!  There is a reason it's empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"One of my favourite chain restaurants. I usually got for the prime rib dinner (they have a 22 ouch that is not on the menu, and worth the $6 over the 16oz), or the prime rib sandwich. The ambiance is nice. I am also a fan of their canyon coffee and creme brulee for desert. The Sq1 location is hit or miss. I find that the sherway location is more consistent, and has a better chef."}
{"text":"Went to Canyon Creek last night for our long overdue anniversary dinner. Choose this particular restaurant because the hubby is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. The service was stellar, Anthony was our server, he was very attentive and had a great table manner. Had the calamari to start, very good, loved the garlic aioli.  We both ordered steaks, I had the steak and lobster mashed potatoes accompanied by asparagus, all very tasty and cooked perfectly. My husband had the New York 12 oz with a loaded baked potato. He declared it the best steak he's had in years. Dessert and specialty coffee followed to complete an overall great meal. Loved the lighting and ambiance, our booth was quite cozy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a really great steak dinner. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Amazing honey butter, a must try! (it's free!) Went for the summerlicious menu, had the shrimp salad for starters, which comes in a cute glass container with dressing on the side. The salad was nice and refreshing, definitely looks way better than my friend's Cesar salad. For the main dish, I ordered the rainbow trout, which was poached perfectly in the inside, and slightly seared on the outside creating a nice crust, and also visually beautiful. The dessert was the chocoholic pot de crème which was nice and creamy, though I would have liked it just to have a bit more sweetness in it. 

The cheery on top of the food experience is the amazing service we received. Our waiter Jeff was not only good looking, but also interacts with the customers with great sincerity. Tip them well!"}
{"text":"The quality of the steak is usually outstanding. Service is always very nice. It's very clean and trendy. My only complaint is sometimes the meal takes a but longer than most steak house. However is it usually worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here on a Friday night given that I was meeting a friend at Sqaure One and none of the restaurants in the vicinity are rated particularly high.

Made reservations on Opentable and asked for a booth  which is what we got. The restaurant was at around 75% at 8 pm so I don't think reservations are that big of an issue. Decor was ok for a chain. The dim lighting probably helped hide some of the flaws.

When it came to the food, I really wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised! We ordered the Asian Nachos to start. Quite creative and very good mix of flavours. For dinner, I ordered the tandoori spiced grilled chicken salad. Again, very good flavour and substantial for a salad! Seemed quite redundant going to a steakhouse as I don't eat beef, but was happy that they actually had decent alternatives!

The prices were very decent. For 1/2 app, main and 8 oz wine, bill was only $40. I joined the Canyon club for a $10 coupon which I used! Waitress was friendly. Service was prompt. All in all, I would be back if I had to limit myself to the Square One area."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for my brother's birthday. The place looks good but definately not the greatest. The service was alright. I reminded the greeter and the server twice that it was a birthday and I wanted to order a surprise pastry/desert or something. They said they'd take care of it. The garlic bread was very good. The food howerver was average. We ordered the Rib eye steak and a NY steak. I went through 3 wines on the list before I got something that was in stock. The service made us feel like we were forcing them to serve us food. No acknowledgement of birthday either. We werent even asked if we wanted desert! For a place that is supposed to be top notch, I almost want to give it 1 star."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  The decor was really nice.  But it took us two and a half hours after being seated to get our food!  There was a convention in town and I don't think they were prepared for it.  That being said, Mark the Manager and our server were very apologetic and he even comped our entrees!  Had he not done that I would have never gone back to that place and would have told everyone I know that they were terrible.  They were more than fair given the hiccup, so I will definitely give them another chance to show their best."}
{"text":"First trip to Toronto and we decided to stop in at Canyon Creek. The food was amazing! Steak and Lobster mash was phenomenal! It was cooked perfectly and would most definitely order again.

But that's about all I can say that was good. Our service was absolutely TERRIBLE! DO NOT attempt to go unless you have a good 2 hours. We were seated and that was the last time we saw anyone for about 20 minutes. We finally got our drinks and then waited another 10 minutes to even order an appetizer. We had no clue bread was involved until we saw another table get some when they were seated. Drink refills? Forget about it. 1 person in our party didn't get silverware. Once we got our check, we waited another 15 mins to actually pay. It was quite frustrating. It was really sad because the food was so dang good! 5 star food. 1 star service."}
{"text":"Excellent experience for a Prime Rib.  The meat just melted in my mouth and the service was spot on ensuring I never had an empty glass.  The entire experience is worth a second trip for this out of towner and will definitely be on my repeat visit next time I am in Canada.

I personally recommend asking for the real horseradish instead of the creamy stuff they give with the Prime Rib it will make all the difference."}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting in a few years and possibly the last. Our server sucked, she was very inattentive and left dirty dishes just sitting on the table. The steaks were small and 2 felt cold. Three of our party had the 34 dollar special, only one of 3 got veggies, the other 2 were very plain. We received our bills before the three got dessert. What a waste of a night out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved dinner here. Server was attentive and friendly. My husband and I ordered the Prix Fixe with prime rib and were able to cut it with a form. We were disappointed they had run out of canyon dip, but didn't let it ruin the meal. The only issues we had were 1. it was super dark, likely due to the fact that it's downstairs and 2. The waitress or kitchen forgot a lobster tail and it took a while for that to come out so I was almost done with dinner by the time it arrived. Otherwise a great meal and decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Service was friendly and efficient. Only imperfection were that the  Fires on the side were salty. They gladly brought some unsalted fries over when we asked. Steaks were done to your preference and were very favourable. I like the Prix Fixe idea. Personalized starter entree and dessert for $37. A good idea. Menu had a lot to select from. Ambiance was nice and staff were very polite and catered to their patrons very well. 
My first time here and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great setting! Lobster cakes were lacking taste, but the salmon salad really made up for it. Huge piece of Salmon next to Asian themed salad with wasabi guacamole. Has great tables for  single business traveler that stay at surrounding hotels. Also free wifi!"}
{"text":"The only place that topped Canyon Creek for me was Hy's Steakhouse but who wants to pay over $200.00 (for two - tip included) every time a craving for juicy steaks comes about?

That being said, Canyon Creek Scarborough has been at the very top of my steakhouse list for years. The prices are reasonable, the service is always fantastic, professional (they know how to take care of customers) and the food (from the appetizers to the main courses) is impeccable. I love the atmosphere. It's perfect for a romantic date or a dinner with family/friends. The booth by the fireplace is my favourite spot.

I only wish that they didn't remove the bacon-wrapped scallops and stuffed mushrooms from their menu. Those were our favourite appetizers! 

I highly recommend this particular location. I always have an incredible time here!"}
{"text":"I came here twice. The first time I was told that my steak would be juicy and delicious - it was a bit disappointing. The side dishes were average...Our server was also very slow.. The second time I came here, I ordered ribs. The quantity is decent, but for the taste....let's just say I had higher expectations - especially since the cost was comparable to other middle-high end restaurants. The decor's nice though - I would give it 0.5 stars higher...but because of my first experience, it has left a bad impression on me."}
{"text":"Stick to the large hunks of cooked meat here and you should be okay. I erroneously decided to stray from the tried and true and ordered the beef stew. Ordering a beef stew in a steakhouse you would expect something somewhat meaty and substantial. What appeared was more akin to a soup than a stew. A 3\" by 6\" by 1\" bowl of gravy with no pieces of beef or vegetable larger than 1 cm square and those amounted to about six in total. The two \"puff pastry\" breadsticks were stale and only added insult to injury - bland and uninteresting. I think I would have much more enjoyed a $2 can of Campbell's Prime Rib Chunky soup from the nearby Walmart with a side of fries from McDonalds. I would have complained but it was my daughter's pre-graduation dinner so held my tongue. She was happy with her wonton nacho appetizer and my wife's prime rib was acceptable.

My advice to Canyon Creek - repackage the beef stew as an appetizer soup since it has no resemblance to any stew I have ever encountered from a can or otherwise. It is insulting that you charge $20 for this entrée. Your menu infers you employ real chefs -  if so, they can do much better. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place was our favourite restaurant to eat at because the burgers were amazing, and the service was amazing as well. BUT TODAY we had a very different experience. The burgers tasted weird so we informed the waitress, only for her to be rude and brush us off. The manager finally came and spoke to us and I showed him the burger meat and how burnt it was and his reply was 'it's cooked on a hot grill, obviously it'll be black and charred'. They didn't offer to get us new food and we were charged full price for our meal. We will never be returning to canyon creek again. And the bacon on one of our burgers was pretty raw too."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Canyon Creek, mostly out of a lack of somewhere else to eat.  Most places were packed due to World Cup, and we couldn't get in.  Canyon Creek wasn't so busy so we gave it a try.

We had the summerlicious menu, and it was great value.  Salad, main, and dessert for $15.  Everything was very fair sized and came out really quickly.  I had the Caesar salad, which had a bit too much anchovy for my liking, but was otherwise good.  I had the Cuban sandwich for the main, which came with fries, which was also very good.  The dessert was a chocolate chilli mousse which was really delicious and just the right size.  

My sister had the rainbow trout which came with an Asian coleslaw.  It had way too much wasabi and was really too hot to eat more than a little bit of, which was unfortunate because it could have been really good.

Also of note, there are no change tables in the bathrooms, which isn't the end of the world, but it's definitely worth noting!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my experience was very uncomfortable. For the first time in a very long while I have experienced racism in a restaurant. I truly hope that others don't feel the way I felt today not just in this restaurant but any restaurant. The service I received felt discriminating and I essentially...lost my appetite."}
{"text":"My wife and I were just looking for a simple, moderately priced steak place and this place fit the bill. We did not want the 50 dollar cuts but did want some unique flavours. An interesting menu with standards and some fusion type apps. All the food was very tasty, service was great and the environment was nice on a cold night. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went here with my step daughter - to be honest I had such a good time with her it wouldn't have mattered where we went or what we had. We sat on the patio I had a Caesar salad it was good fresh lettuce always helps ... prices were good - staff was pretty fast and attentive"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed!

 This was my second visit since 2007.  Yesterday, we decided to come due to my recommendations.  We decided Canyon Creek due to a $50 gift card we received on our birthdays from my coworker (we have the same birthday).  We would've went to these franchise of Swiss Chalet, Jack Astor, Far Niete, and Canyon Creek but stuck with something a little fancy.  I previously had a birthday in 2007 with service and food that left an impression but yesterday had changed everything.

 They're doing a Lobsterlust special on their menu.  We decided to order their 2 pint of pale ale, lobster cob salad, and 8oz striploin steak with drunken lobster. 

 We weren't impressed with service as our waiter \"Simon\" didn't offer us appetizers, when we clearly said we're sharing.  We asked another waitress cause it was hard to get his attention.  She recommended the spinach dip and told the kitchen to hold our mains (appreciated it).   When the mains came, steak wasn't medium -rare as asked and cob salad was chunky and bland.  When our meals was finished, Simon didn't recommend us dessert or coffee or tea.  

I wasn't impress overall and food didn't \"WOW\" me."}
{"text":"Not impressed.... out of 4 meals not one was hot.... they are extremely pricey you would think it would be better.  Manager had to come to our table three times... I felt bad but quality was not there at all.  The bartender serving us was great no issues with service.
Probably be a very cold day before I ever return :("}
{"text":"Came to this location with my dad and grandma. It was not busy at this time, which was nice. The servers worked in teams, so we didn't wait long for anything.

My Dad got ribs and my Nan and I had the Prime Rib Sandwich. Ribs were huge! Prime Rib was cooked to order. I had this sandwich at the Front Street location and HAD to get it again. The au jus is so damn good, I couldn't resist. They serve Starbucks coffee which is awesome.

The service was excellent. My Dad is a talker and they still managed to laugh at his jokes. :P 

This one is close to home, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in for dinner. We wanted something close to Union since we were taking the train. We had 1 hour. We did not tell our server that we were in any type of hurry.

We arrived and were seated in a big comfy booth. Decor is classic. Sound level was low as it was not busy; we were there kinda early.

Our server brought our drinks, took our orders and within 15min we had hot, fresh meals. Wow! I had the Prime Rib Sandwich with Fries and my mom chose the Southwest Chicken.

My sandwich was excellent. Beef was tender and sliced thin. The au jus was to die for. I definitely used all of it! Fries were super thin; like mini McD's fries. Almost annoying to eat, but good. I felt weird eating a whole handful at a time. :P My mom's chicken was seasoned well with a little kick and topped with avocado and peppers on basmati rice. Good stuff!

We were out of there with almost 20min to spare! Amazing! I know the service is probably slower during busy times, but this was perfect. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! I was here for the holidays during the snow storm, originally from California. One of the best places while visiting Canada. The place itself was nice and neat. If I lived here it would be one of my favorite spots"}
{"text":"One of my favourite chain restaurants! Excellent service, good quality food and a nice bustling ambience. Great for nice casual dining!

 I'm a fan of their warm bread and whipped butter,and their calamari starter! Their Lamb Two Ways is also quite nice, especially the grilled chops- succulent, smoky and pink in the middle! I love finishing off my meal with their Pumpkin Creme Brulee, a silky pumpkin spiced pudding topped with a hard caramelized topping... mmm-mmmm. Perfect end to a perfect dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Prime Rib Sandwich (which incidentally is the only thing on the menu that appeals to me), and it was a very blah experience.

The place tries to look like an authentic Chop House, but it can't really hide the fact that it's nothing more than a Sir Corp boxed food joint. 

The menu seems such the same-- really old school meat and potatoes-something for everyone-maybe salmon if you're on a diet-have a steak, but it won't be that great- kinda place. And for almost $30 for each entree, I can't justify any of the selections.
I also can't justify, how all these chain restaurants love to display their wine bottles vertically and use them as decoration in each and every nook and cranny. I know that less wine is bottled with a cork, but unless their rotating their stock very carefully, this could lead to a lot of spoilage. It's total chain bollocks. Go to any corporate place-- O&B or the like and you'll see this being done. 

Roast Beef Sandwich was okay. The kitchen (or our waiter), forgot to put the horseradish mayo on the plates for us. We noticed that something didn't taste right half way through, and when we asked for it, the waiter was very apologetic and brought it right out.

In my opinion. The only thing on the menu worth having is this sandwich. Some of the apps are really good, but the entrees fall short and seem unappetizing.

Not to fussed about going back here."}
{"text":"Always a fan of that Chipotle sirloin! My go to steakhouse when I'm craving steak at a moderately fair price. Occasionally, but being on their listserv, they'll have neat member-only specials and incentives. Service can be hit or miss at this location though."}
{"text":"We came here after a horrible experience at Milestones. Had a fantastic time! I was ecstatic to find out that they indeed still have filet mignon on the menu, and they have it a variety of ways! 
The food was fantastic, the wine list was very extensive, and DESSERT! 

The atmosphere was great, the waitress had a great personality And she even charged my phone for me!!

I can't wait until we go back!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Canyon Creek (Rathburn Rd, Mississauga, near Square One). Nice cosy atmosphere, plenty of parking, clean interior and washroom. Food options are good, steak is the reason for going. However I was very much torn between the prime rib, but opted for the chipotle sirloin as recommended by our server Kailee. The prixe fix menu cannot be beat. $36 for three courses and all delectable options, the hard part is choosing! Along with my steak I enjoyed the fully loaded potato. My starter was mushroom soup and my dessert choice was creme brûlée. Lovely wine selection and a variety of drinks. Something for everyone. You get great value on food prepared with fresh, quality ingredients with lovely plating. 5/5"}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse food.  I must mention that they have great service.  I had a burger which filled the gap nicely - served with a dijon mustard sauce on the side.  Not a destination dining spot, but I imagine it would be a good place to stop before a Blue Jays or Maple Leafs game to line the stomach."}
{"text":"First time there... wanted a nice prime rib... got a huge piece of cold fat and a plate of under cooked vegetable.  Never offered more bread and never really saw the waiter much.  Advertised free WiFi but given two different codes that never worked.  I will most certainly not dine there again the next time I am in Scarborough or wanting a good piece of steak."}
{"text":"If your in the neighbourhood and in the mood for steak I recommend heading over to Wellington and york to a place called BARDIS a little higher price range but worth it because unlike canyon creek it's a true restaurant experience a true steakhouse and worth every penny. Canyon creek is part of the Sircorp family and therefore their menu items are the same as every other sircorp restaurant. The avocado tomato and frozen shrimp brushetta is identical to the one at scaddabush, which makes no sense being on a 'chophouse' menu. They cut corners on food quality, over staff and management has attitude like they are working at canoe, but not one of them even knows what 'velouté' means. I worked there for a week and it was comical to see people in there 40s attempting to run the line. FRESH FRESH, screaming at people to run their food' their terrible terrible food yet unable to clean a plate to proper presentation. IF SAUCE DRIPS ON THE SIDE, WIPE IT UP.  Anyways walk two blocks over to BARDIS and enjoy your self. Unless your okay with spending your money with microwaved mashed potatoes then canyon is the place for you! Haha a seriously terribly run restaurant and terrible food quality. RUN!!!!"}
{"text":"A great selection for a group outing on a chilly winter's night.
We had a group of 10 hungry diners and they accommodated us in superb style albeit a bit rough on some of the finesse items.  Our waitress was very interesting.  Full of energy and strong opinions on  the food which was refreshing.
I chose to ignore her suggestion and went for the 14oz prime rib.  It was perfectly cooked to medium rare.  The meat was tender and full of flavour.  My fully stuffed baked potato though looked like it was on life support.  My colleague's potato was huge with the stuffing forming a mini-mountain.  Mine was more akin to a valley where I had to look inside.  The replacement one was much better.
And now for the finesse stuff, or lack thereof.  Out came the meals and several of us got the wrong plates.  We got it sorted out but speaks to a lack of a process.  The prime rib, while tasty was not hot coming off the pass.  Not cold but definitely not hot.  It was quite an effort to get our water glasses topped up.  Lots of attention if you ordered something from the bar but the basic attention to detail was a bit lacking.
A fun evening, pretty good food but service efficiency was a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Service was slow when my boyfriend and I went to this location. Take in mind it's only a Wednesday night and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Maybe it was just us but we received every item we ordered so slowly whereas other groups received their items quickly after ordering. We probably spent 2hrs at this establishment and 1hr and half of it was waiting for our food and service. The food isn't bad. Nothing special."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was exceptional. Our waiter, David, took great care of us. David is the reason I'm leaving a review. We weren't the easiest of parties, but he handled us with grace and professionalism. Next time I'm in Toronto I'll be back because the food was good and David was great."}
{"text":"Had a dinner for my Mother's birthday there.  Very busy, so glad Yelp helped out on reservations.  Also, the restaurant was smoky probably because of the kitchen.  However, food was great and cooked well.  good value for the money and will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service , good steaks (although quality declined in recent months) and nice atmosphere.  Good date night with quiet tables .  Only fault is that their offers from head office are not always honoured at this location unless you insist .  Recent visit for example 15% off until August 31 for lunch from card on table for members - which I am.  When asked waitress \"oh that ended June 1.\"  It was honored by manager when I insisted but why put the card on the table if not in effect?  Second time this as happened at this location."}
{"text":"Red meat. We hadn't had it in awhile so our group headed here because it was near the Fan Expo. Extra chipper boy wonder waiter? Check. Loaded baked potatoes? Check. Succulent prime rib? Oh boy did it hit the spot. The soundtrack was good, too. This isn't a premiere steakhouse if you're a steakhouse snob who cares about all the details, but we had a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"I use to lovee this place but my last visit was just meh.  They give you free bread to start with honey butter and I ordered a side caesar.  Their caesar has always been amazing, but failed to impress me this time.  The dressing is super garlicy and the aftertaste will last alllll night haha so don't forget to bring some gum.  Had the ribs as my main.  They were pretty tender and the bbq sauce was good, but nothing great.  I feel like the quality of this restaurant has gone down a lot in the last few years"}
{"text":"we were staying out at the airport as our AM flight was really early. We decided to try this place out for a beer and a quick snack. We ordered the prime sliders and wow were they amazing. Great atmosphere and terrific service."}
{"text":"With the exception of The Keg, this is one of the better chain restaurants I have been to. The starter bread with the delicious honey butter is a nice touch. The service is always excellent - knowledgeable and efficient. The Caesar salad comes in a chilled bowl with real bacon bits and shaved Parmesan. It is delicious, but beware, the dressing is very heavy on the garlic. The cheeseburger I had last time was amazing! The house-made egg bun really makes this burger stand out for me. The patty itself was very juicy as well. My only complaint is that it's in a basement, so you don't get a lot of natural light and it does tend to be very dark inside. However, the food and service are worth going back for."}
{"text":"Location: 255 Bass Pro Mills Drive, Vaughan, ON L4K 0A2 (right behind Vaughan Mills) 
Price: $$$
Service: Good 

I guess Canyon Creek would be considered an upscale restaurant compare to other chains of fancy restaurant (ex like Joeys). Personally, I think Joeys better. 

The location I went to is rather quiet compared to the one at Square One. I went during lunch time, and it was not busy at all. I feel like it's a very generic \"upper scale\" restaurant from the layout to the food. Canyon creek however is known for their steak- so they say. Whoever they are, it is true. I love my steak to be rare and usually when restaurants say they make rare well, my steak comes out medium rare. To my surprised Canyon creek stayed true and my steak came out rare! It had a beautiful red centre and soft- it was cooked well. 

Even though the food is generic, their lobster guacamole is something folks should try. They did a good job balancing out the taste of seafood and the guacamole. 

Verdict: Meh"}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant and atmosphere. The service was excellent. I had steak which was very good. Dessert and appetizers were good. We had chicken pagoda as appetizer and for desert banana cream pie. I really enjoyed it! Oh and the bread they give you as appetizer is so fresh and tasty, yummy!"}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious 2017 during lunch.

Arrived at 12 PM and there was a line forming at the entrance. Looking inside, the lounge area was pretty empty, and looking at the rest of the seating area, it was also not too busy. It looks like it just takes a really long time to have people seated. Ended up waiting almost 5 minutes before we got seated.

I like the interior design here, and the way the tables are arranged throughout the floor. Initially I thought it was just the lounge up front, but then heading inside you can see it's very spacious.
Washrooms are also very nice, and they've got strong air freshener going.

The waiter came around to take orders, taking time to go through the menu and provide some recommendations. For some reason, bibimbap and pho were on the winterlicious menu. They don't offer that normally. Personally, I would have preferred something closer to what was on their regular menu rather than some random \"unique\" dishes, so I went with the Candied Atlantic Salmon, the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the Salted Dark Chocolate Ganache.

We were offered some fresh bread with honey butter on the side. Additional bread available on request.

I wasn't particularly impressed by the dishes. The candied salmon came with what I guess is smoked salmon with some beets and something like orange or tangerine. Tasted alright.

The fried chicken sandwich was pretty average. The meat was dry, and skin was somewhat crispy, and it cooled down way too fast. Given that this is on their regular menu, I can't say it's worth the $13 The thin-cut fries fries that came with the sandwich were pretty good though. The waiter had asked if I wanted anything to go with the fries, but it never came. I probably could have put in a reminder, but it wasn't a big deal.

The chocolate ganache had a pretty nice texture; very creamy, very chocolatey. I liked it.
Not so much the salty white cream at the top though.

Someone at our table ordered the beef pho, and noted the beef was great, but the noodles were undercooked and the broth had a sweet flavour for some reason.

I had a little taste of the Rainbow Trout Bibimbap. The fish was pretty good! But the rest was pretty average.

The place wasn't particularly busy, but the service was still pretty slow.
I wonder if the dishes had been sitting around for some time before they were served.

Given that this place seems to specialize in steak or beef, perhaps those would have been better options. But unfortunately, they weren't on the winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday, we got a reservation so we were seated immediately. The atmosphere is nice and trendy. Ordered the ribs with a side of mash. Ribs were well seasoned and extremely tender, mashed potatoes were very creamy. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend of mine from toronto thinking i'd buy him a sandwich. Turns out it is a bit more expensive than i thought. 

But the lunch turned out great. He had meat loaf and i had the prime rib. as usual. 

Interestingly enough I can honestly say this was the only place i ordered prime rib for take out because i was in one of \"MUST HAVE MEAT\" mode. 

Their burgers are great, offer variety of meat but as long as you make prime rib juicy and pink i'm your fan."}
{"text":"We come here a few times a year to celebrate birthdays and I find Canyon Creek offers a nice, consistent experience.  Service is always good and they'll rush you out if you ask them to (or take their time if you don't ask).

Food is always good - we generally have the steak, which is always cooked nicely and delicious.  My only comment about the steak is that I wish they put vegetables with all steaks as opposed to only certain ones.  Anything else we've ever tried here has been pretty good too.

This place can be very busy, especially the entryway, and so make a reservation otherwise you'll be asked to wait (sometimes a long time).  Once you are seated, the basement atmosphere is dark and surprisingly quiet for the amount of tables that are in the place.

Overall, we enjoy coming here a few times a year.  They are in direct competition with The Keg and they are both different restaurants with positives to both.  This location, however, is excellent for anything sports or concert related in the city and is always reliable to visit."}
{"text":"My parents like coming here for their birthday and I like eating steak! We started off with a Caesar salad and"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit here as a group of 5.  Not bad i must say, i didnt know what to expect.  The salmon was good, the chicken was complemented by one of our group and the steaks were spot on so I am told.  My son had one of their burgers and it had a bit to much char on it for his taste however some people may say thas what they look for is a good sear and some grill marks so its a matter of opinion i guess.  Cant fault them for that.  Service was great.  We will be back.  There are a few more menu items i would like to try"}
{"text":"Going to Canyon Creek for Valentine's day seemed like a great way to have a nice dinner. Upon arrival, service started out great. We got our drinks; the pomegranate daiquiri  was wonderful. Our appetizer was great. We had the Thai wraps as a starter which in itself could have been a meal. 

The entrees were good, however when the fresh fries came, they were too salty. Gratefully the server brought us some less salted fries. I had the filet mignon and it was done well and tasted great but with your entree only coming with one side, it seems like a rip off to pay all that money for steak and potatoes. Portion sizes was ok, but would have been rounded out better with a second side. If we didn't order a started, I'd probably have left the restaurant starving. 

I ordered the creme brulee for dinner and it was not that great. It tasted more like a flan as opposed to a creme brulee. I think if you're going to have creme brulee on your menu, it better taste like crème brulee.

My server was very nice in the beginning and as the evening went on, he became less attentive. When I did mention the creme brulee not being up to par, he just shrugged and said oh well. 

Would I go back to Canyon Creek? Sure, if I had a coupon. I just think there are better steak restaurants out there that will give better value for your money.

For overall experience, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night w.  my gfs.

I feel like C.C gets the short end of the stick and not enough praise as a chain resto.
Frankly their menu is legit.  This is like a Keg situation but better, at this location at least.
The asian nachos are very good - do order them, they use sweet chili and wonton wraps as the nachos. I ordered a soup and it ended up being a beef stew, it was pretty good.
my gfs got pecan pie and sliders.
The space was great, service was also good. we were there until absolute last call and probably the last ones there, and no one complained or told us they are closing.

The prices are very reasonable. I dont remember C.C being this good, but for 2013 this was a pretty good chain resto meal.

Go here, its also across the street from a lot of t.o. tourist stuff - cn tower, convention centre, etc.

parking is kind of hard to get around here, but sunday, free after 9 p.m. on the street right in front of the place."}
{"text":"I love their Chipotle steak it is very YUM!

My sweetheart loves the Prime rib, it's nice and rare and soft and juicy! 

I haven't been disappointed yet but I tend to order Steak only.

Oh yeah and he Bread rolls with Honey butter is tasty for you breadies\"

Nice place for a date night or a more personal dinner, it's dim lighting adds to that type of experience."}
{"text":"Perhaps just chose a bad night (Over an hour wait from order till appetizer arrived). Table of 4. Service was slow and at best average (Had to flag a different waiter with a pepper mill).
    Neither meal, nor appetizer soup, nor cappucccino arrived to table hot. And over selling of cappuccino from a $13,000 machine made it even less so. 
Very little attention from server, (Chris) who despite a busy night engaged other tables surrounding us. 
     Taste wise the food was good, but portion size made it seem more adequate as \"fine dining\" rather than a meal with very small portions of side vegetables.
    This restaurant seemed more suited for first date couples who wish to linger over their food and enjoy the idea of smaller portions at higher prices.
     While some of our party had experienced Canyon Creek previously, this was my first and last time as I can get better value and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came, we ate, we enjoyed  kind and attentive service.  Food was tasty and it is a great place for families and groups.  Thumbs up for the garden burger, child's chicken fingers and the prime rib dinner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the prime rib here but it left something to be desired tbh. 

Walked in on a Saturday and was immediately seated server came over to explain menu as we have never been here and gave us a few minutes to decent as she brought us water. She was very attentive thru out the dinner but nothing to write home about.

Opt'd for the 37 prix fix with the +4 update for a 12oz prime rib. 

First came the beard with honey butter, it was ok I wouldn't have cared if I had it or not after trying it. I got the seasonal soup as my app, it was good but tasted a little ... burnt? And it was a pretty small portion not sure if that's the regular menu size but not worth is so. 

Prime rib came shortly after I finished the soup, it was almost tasteless I had to use a little salt and pepper to up the flavour, ended up with too much salt (my fault) and made it mad salty LOL.. the mash potatoes were okay had to pour the au jus on it to get through it though. I didn't hate it but I didn't really enjoy it tooooo much. 

Prix fix came with a dessert too but I didn't like the options so I switched with my brother cause he wanted the brownie and I just ordered a coconut banana cream pie off the menu which was probably my favourite part of the entire dinner, LOL. 

In short; came for prime rib didn't like it, service was OK nothing amazing I wouldn't come back if I had a choice but if I didn't; probably would order the steak considering it's a steakhouse"}
{"text":"Had a great Cesar salad and the service was fast and good. My friend had a burger and said it was okay but nothing special. The place has a nice atmosphere and I feel it delivers want you expect for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We were back in the Bridge for my sister in law's birthday and she had decided to have it at Canyon Creek at Vaughan Mills.  

I've been to Canyon Creek many times but the one near Sherway Gardens, not this particular one ever before.  It was a Wednesday evening so this is the type of place I wouldn't necessarily go to if it wasn't a holiday or weekend but the place was still quite lively, not bopping and busy as to be expected but maybe 40% to half full.

The birthday girl ordered several nachos and spinach dip apps and I had ordered the new Seoul Food chicken app.  The nachos app is great.  The spinach dip may be a bit thicker to be a dip as you'll break your chips trying to dip it, use the spoon to spoon some on your side dish it's easier.  You can dip into the salsa though, that will work.  The dip is creamy and cheesy and good while it's still warm, as cheese goes it will solidify a bit when it cools.  The chips are nice and salty and can even be eaten by themselves.

The Korean chicken app was different and didn't really meet my expectations.  They were cubes of white meat, battered and rolled into some sort of grain mix almost like rice crispies and deep fried.  They were crunchy yes, but without the sauce they were sort of bland.  I've been spoiled by more authentic Korean fried chicken it seems.  This was a twist on a taste but just something a little different but not really special IMO.

My wife is not used to eating heavy in the evenings so she ordered something light, just fish tacos.  To me this is the wrong thing to order in a steak house but it's what she wanted.  I didn't ask her how they were but they looked like fish sticks on tortillas to be honest.  

For me, when in a steak place, get a steak.  That's what I did and I decided to get one of the better cuts, a ribeye.  I had asked for it medium and honestly it was done basically to perfection.  I liked the cut and it is as advertised... marbled.  I took a side of mashed this time instead of what I usually get which is a loaded baked just to change things up a bit.  It was a great meal and Canyon Creek is good at steaks... it's their thing.  

So to summarize, yes to the spinach dip, no to the Korean chicken app, a hella yes to the ribeye steak.

Our server was good and although a bit dim, the ambiance is nice.  We were seated basically in a private area with a long table (under 20) and we had the gratuity automatically added (and HIGHLIGHTED that it was already added at 15%)  on the bills.  The server also said to not add tip since it was already added.  It seems every place doesn't use 18% as the new 15%.

Overall I like Canyon Creek and I pretty much always have.  They are a chain but I don't care, they are good."}
{"text":"I came here on a late Saturday night with some of my friends. I was taking them out to dinner to express my immense gratitude for their unconditional support. 

We were seated immediately in the dining area and was greeted with our server Michelle. She was super sweet and very attentive with our table. 
She was very knowledgeable with the menu and gave us great recommendations. 

My friends and I, ordered the canyon dip and guacamole, steak, prime rib sandwich and the garlic shrimp ravioli. Everything was delicious! My favourite was probably the prime rib sandwich. The au jus and the horseradish definitely made the sandwich.

I've always loved Canyon Creek, I love the sophistication and the ambiance of the restaurant. I've never had a problem with the service. The servers are great and very friendly. Our server was very personable with her guests and seemed like she loved/cared about her job. So thank you Canyon Creek and to the servers for the amazing experience. 

The restaurant, food and service is great! I will definitely be coming back. 

10/10!"}
{"text":"Amazing Service, Outstanding Food, and Warm Atmosphere. 10/10

Canyon Creek has been my go-to steak house for 2 years now, and although they know you've been a returning customer they treat you with outstanding service and smile everytime.

Just recently my Steak was not cooked to my liking, they returned it and made me a fresh one and even held my friends food so it wouldn't get cold. The manager even came over to apologize a simple mistake. This type of customer service was wonderful and gave my friend an amazing first impression. 

Food: Delicous, seasoned very well, served on a warm plate. The price is definitely a lil more than the average restaurant but the quality definitely doesn't slip.

Service: Outstanding, servers gladly adjust orders, and very knowledgeable to the menu. Regularly checks up to see if the food is good.

Atmosphere: Warm family oriented atmosphere, also has a patio, bar and restaurant area. Very versatile for any occasion. The hours are great too! 

Conclusion: I'm glad I stumbled upon Canyon Creek, I can tell that the management is very well done and the staff is trained properly. I will be back for more delicious steak!"}
{"text":"Great place, Good Service, and Decent food.

Canyon creeks has the same menu in all locations, however they do have differences.

Service: As always Canyon creek does a loyal job training the servers and bartenders! Good Service even when we came 30 minutes before closing we were still greeted very well and servers weren't bugged to serve us that late.

Food: As always consistency is key, and they nail it. The price is decent, however it is still high ended. Our steaks were pretty poorly cooked and tasted very little of anything. I Believe the chef wasn't paying much attention as my steak was slightly over cooked and my friend has his tasting nothing but a burned out grill.

The soup was Great, but nothing to wow about. 

Atmosphere: Great Atmosphere, bathrooms well cleaned, and the place is well kept.


In all the experience was pleasant, canyon creek has been a staple to me for many years, and even in other locations I'm glad they carry over the level of professionalism through every branch."}
{"text":"Been here once and I'm not sure how I feel about returning again. 

To begin with, this place is very pricey for their meals. The usual pasta I got was almost $20. I know it was the place is very formal and what not, but the lighting was very poor here. 

Our service was very slow and even after finishing our meal, the waitress didn't bother asking if we wanted our bill. I think we waited for about 20 min before we asked for it. 

The chicken penne was bland as I was expecting more for high price place. I did get their bread and that was good."}
{"text":"Just about every Christmas for the past 19 years or so a small group of friends gathers here for our annual get together Christmas dinner.  This last visit was actually for my brother in law's birthday.  They live in Vaughan but the Canyon Creek up there basically wanted to kick us out after a few hours essentially giving us a time limit.

This particular Canyon Creek across from Sherway Garden has been VERY accommodating for weekends and is one of the reasons why we always return here every year for our Christmas get together because they take reservations YES that's right they take reservations on weekends and they dont' expect you to LEAVE by a certain time.  In other words we can eat, drink and be merry without having to worry about when we are going to get the boot you know probably because we are paying customers.

While Canyon Creek may not be the end all be all of steakhouses the simple fact that this particular location is accommodating to my group of friends and in this case, my brother in law and most of my in laws that live in Vaughan is one of the reasons I believe this particular Canyon Creek deserves some special recognition.  While so many other places refuse to take reservations on a weekend this place is one of the few reliable exceptions.  It's not as if this place is a dead location either.  Even when we were leaving at about 9pm there were people queued in the waiting area and overall the place was pretty busy.  We had stayed a little longer because being as it was my brother in law's birthday we had brought our own cake which the restaurant was happy to serve us after dinner.

While some things have changed through the years such as salads are extra, no more chop house salad, the menu changes etc those little things are to be expected.  The level of professionalism and service we have ALWAYS received from this particular Canyon Creek is exceptional and it always has been.  The servers are constantly refilling our water, they always ask if there's anything we need, they come around to make sure everybody's steak is cooked the way they had asked etc.  The level of attention is more than could be expected each time, every time.

As far as the food goes it is good and better than average.  I can't give it a perfect because being to many steak houses I can say I've had better but the bang for the buck at this place is about on par for what you could expect.  

The ambiance is nice, the lighting is dim if not intimate and the level of noise is acceptable.  It can be a tight place but the only time I guess I feel crowded is making my way to the rest room because you do basically have to make your way to towards the front and you can then realize how busy this place is and the amount of people in it.

I had ordered a 12oz New York strip with a loaded backed potato and side caesar.  My wife had ordered the coffee crusted 7oz angus coffee crusted steak with beans and russet mashed.  The birthday boy had ordered a couple spinach dip, salsa and tortilla apps as well as a couple plates of calamari.

Overall it was a very nice birthday dinner for my brother in law and the service as always was supurb."}
{"text":"I went in for a business lunch with 6 others. The service was good but I didn't like the portion sizes. I ordered a Salmon Seafood Salad, it was good but they had halved my shrimps...stingy for sure."}
{"text":"Its not the Keg - but it tries to be.

My wife took me to Canyon Creek for my birthday.  It was her first time there and maybe my 6th or 7th time.  We had a reservation, thhough at 7:30 on a Friday night we didn't really need one.

The atmosphere is just like the keg, uniforms are a little more casual, but the ambiance is darkly lit giving our booth a nice secluded atmosphere to it.

The service was friendly.  We were quickly greeted and brought to our table.  Our server appeared lickity split and we ordered our drinks.  I had ordered a concoction including lemonade and vodka, but I didn't really taste the vodka in it.

My wife had a half rack of ribs.  She rather liked them.  I had a prime rib, with a side of veggies.  One thing I will say was I don't like the horseradish at Canyon Creek.  They mix it with mayo.  I much more prefer straight-up horseradish like how they serve it at the keg.  

I'd still give the edge to the Keg, though the staff seem much more relaxed than the Keg.  I just like the food at the Keg more."}
{"text":"The dishes were hit-and-miss for our group. 

We got the Canyon Creek Dip ($11) appetizer, which came with a yummy green artichoke dip, and a spicy one which most of us didn't like. The complementary fresh bread with honey butter was comforting and appreciated, but nothing to go nuts over.  

I got the Mushroom & Caramelized Onion Meatloaf ($18). I chose right, since it was moist, flavourful, and delicious. I enjoyed the mushrooms, onion-ring-like bits on top, and the mashed potatoes. Based on my dish alone, I would give this place 4 stars. But considering my other dinner companions' dishes, I had to take away a star.

The Grilled Salmon Salad ($19) was apparently lacklustre. The salmon was cooked too much, and there was nothing special about the greens. While the dressing sounds good in theory, it was barely there on the plate. The combination of the salmon and the salad did not work. It was bland, unfortunately. 

The 7-oz Certified Angus Beef Top Sirloin Steak ($21) was apparently fine (even for a very picky eater), but nothing to rave about. 

Lastly, the Roasted Hunter Chicken ($20) failed to impress. Apparently there was a lot of fat on the chicken, and the flavours simply did not work. Blandness, again, was a complaint. The little bit of truffle sauce that was included was delicious, but there was hardly any.

In summary, I think I enjoyed my dish the best, despite mine being the least expensive. But everything was too expensive for what it was: There were no harmonious, transcendent flavour combinations. At least there were good flavours, and they worked; I only wish that could have been the case for the rest of my dinner companions.

We went at 6 P.M. on a Tuesday, so it was very quiet, and service was extra friendly and quick. I found the light hanging down a bit annoying, shining in my eyes too brightly, but it wasn't too offensive. The rest of the decor was comfortable and nice. 

There is not a lot of choice in Scarborough, so it's a good choice if you just want something where everyone can find something non-offensive and filling to eat, even when you have picky eaters in your midst. You won't have a culinary life-changing experience here, but you are also unlikely to regret it much. 

We were too full from the dinner, so didn't get to try desserts. Maybe there will be a next time."}
{"text":"You would think that a simple salad like this would be nothing too spectacular but this one was absolutely over-the-top delicious!  There was a honey goat cheese coulis spread across the plate with the arugula salad built on top of it of red, golden & candy cane beets, Anjou pear, with lemon vinaigrette and Grana Padano parmesan, raw julienned candy cane beets, and sorrel cress arranged strategically in a row."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a steak for dinner and there's no shortage of Steakhouses in Toronto. We wanted a place that was within walking distance of the hotel and not going to charge an arm and a leg for dinner. I didn't realize Canyon Creek was a chain restaurant, but it doesn't look like one from inside or out and with the menu. The menu has plenty of choices and aside from drinks, you can really get a lot of food for a decent price versus what you might pay for an a la carte place. The food was excellent and only outdone by the service. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"For years my old group of friends would meet every Saturday before whenever Christmas fell on the calendar and have a get together dinner at the Canyon Creek on the Queensway across from Sherway Gardens.

This year it was a bit of a surprise that the location on the Queensway had closed so in keeping with the tradition we had to find another Canyon Creek to have our annual dinner.  The airport location was fully booked so we went with the location on Rathburn near Square One in Mississauga.

We arrived early as our reservation was for 530 and everybody eventually rolled in just afterwards.  This location seemed a lot more open with space and had a less cramped feel to it as opposed to our old regular location.  We were 6 and we had a nice round table with had plenty of space just by the fireplace on the western wall.

They had a decently priced prix fix option which included a starter, the main being a surf and turf along with a crème brule dessert for just 40 dollars.  We both decided to go with that while I also went with an additional soup of the day starter which was cream of mushroom.

As I said we were sort of early so the space around us seems rather sparse but as the evening went on the place started to fill up and become more lively.  Our server was on top of our drinks and was quite helpful all evening.  

The meal was better than just OK.  While steak dinners are a bit of a treat this one didn't come long after we recently just went to Ruth's Chris.  Mind you these are not the same echelon of restaurant but Canyon Creek is still a nice ambiance, decent meal and bang for the buck value kind of dinner at a fraction of the price of Ruth's.

Comparing this location to the location that's closed on the Queensway I have to say this location was much more spacious and comfortable while the food and service is what you'd come to expect from a Canyon Creek / Cara restaurant.

Between the Keg, Chop, and Canyon Creek they're all around that same echelon and they're all good.  The Keg is a bit more traditional and upscale while Chop has a lot of menu options and ways to customize your meal, Canyon Creek has probably the best value.

This location has a decent amount of parking and it's not far from the 403 so it's not hard to get to.  It is however near the mall, movie theater and the city center for Mississauga so expect your everyday traffic around the area.

It looks like we just found our new Canyon Creek to have our annual dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely the best steakhouse chain in Ontario, you'll forget about the Keg and everywhere else once you go here. The servers are great and knowledgable. You won't go anywhere else!

My favourite is the Filet Mignon, cooked to perfection every time! They have been adding lots to the menu this past year, there are almost too many appetizers to choose from."}
{"text":"We were originally going to trek out to Mount Pleasant to go to Pallucci as I had a DealFind coupon, but because the weather was so crappy and I was pretty beat from the UYE and post-UYE Starbucks gathering, I decided to eat somewhere local.  My best friend and I figured Canyon Creek would probably be a shorter wait because it was not in the immediate surrounding area of the Scarborough Town Centre, and there would be less crowds.  We were right about that one!

The service was great.  The server was attentive.  He told us the specials and the cost.  This I found was helpful.  There is nothing worse than going to a restaurant, being baited in to ordering a special, and then having that surprised look when the bill comes.  

I ordered a lychee martini and when it came I had to confirm that what he gave me was indeed a lychee matini.  I for one, have never had a PINK lychee martini, and to top it off, there was no lychee in it!  The server had explained that someone neglected to put the lychees in the fridge and he didn't feel comfortable putting it in my drink.  The first disappointment of the night.

The bread basket followed shortly after.  I don't know what they put in their butter, but whatever it is, my best friend and I got hooked right away.  It was the first time I had ever tasted a sweet butter.  I know... it sounds weird, but it is actually very tasty.  The bread was nice and soft in the centre, and crusty on the outside... and best of all - it was WARM!

My main was a bit disappointing.  After having had a day of overindulgent eating, I decided to eat a bit healthier, and so I opted for fish.  The fish itself was a bit on the drier side, but the vegetables were quite tasty.  The sauce was tangy, with a vinegar base, but the sweetness of the caramelized onions balanced out the tartness.  The mushrooms were very savoury and the spinach was cooked just right.  

I think my best friend's main was generally more satisfying than mine.  But I mean, how can you go wrong with steak?  It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, and I definitely wouldn't put it on the same level as the Keg, but it was still pretty good.  

When we were brought the dessert menus, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered Starbucks coffee and tea.  I ordered a cappuccino, and we also ordered a cheesecake to share.  Both were a disappointment.  The cappuccino was awful because the foam was a watered down mess.  The cappuccino itself was decent, but definitely not up to par with what I'd get at a real Starbucks.  The cheesecake was more cheese than it was anything else.  It was too soft for my liking, and not sweet enough.

All in all, including the 2 pints of beer that my best friend ordered, the bill came to $101.56 before tip.  Considering the quality of food we had, and quantity, I thought this was a bit on the steep side.  I've experienced much better for that price point."}
{"text":"Reading some really good reviews on here, I had higher expectations for this place. I wasn't expecting it to be as good or better than The Keg, which I really like. However, the server we had was spectacular, she was very nice and accommodating. 

The food on the other hand.... eh. It was *okay*. The honey whipped butter is really light, sweet, and delicious and is paired with multi-grain bread for the starter. My boyfriend and I went to watch a movie before dinner and had a lot of snacks, so we weren't super hungry and decided to share everything. We got the calamari fritti to start and although it could've been more deep fried/more crispy, it was yummy. The sundried tomato aioli it comes with is delicious (before it came, I asked for chipotle mayo sauce but it did not even compare to the aioli)! We shared the 14 oz prime rib with russet potato mash and got a side of sauteed mushrooms. I was pretty disappointed in this because the prime rib was HIGHLY praised from Yelp reviews, but it was pretty dry and the mashed tasted like nothing, just a plain potato. I definitely wouldn't recommend the mash.

Canyon Creek is a tad pricier than The Keg (calamari $15/$13, prime rib $36/33). Given the slight price difference and how I wasn't really satisfied with my meal, I don't think I'd come back here to eat."}
{"text":"It was our first time (ever) here, and we were seated fairly quickly as we did arrive to the restaurant around 9pm. We sat at one of these seats (shown below). Our booth was on the inside and had a nice romantic wall light along with a real candle on the table - not one of the \"fake\" push-a-button ones hahaha.

Do note that there wasn't any hooks to hang our coats, because some places like Milestones have that per table.. so our coats and my purse were just all plopped in our seats.

Our initial waitress greeted us about after 5-8 minutes, introduced herself and gave us water. When serving us water, she actually slammed (maybe slammed isn't the right word... like aren't they supposed to be fancy and delicate when serving??) the glass and it made me jump. That was a -1 in my books. After asking if we wanted anything else to drink, she left us to look at the menu.

Their menu consisted of Steak options (yaaaaas), appetizers like salads and soups, side entrees of chicken tacos, korean fried chicken and a special type of guacamole, pastas, burger sliders and main salads.

Our eyes focused on the Steak section of the menu since that's what we came for. I was debating against the Steak & Shrimp, Mushroom Truffletta or the Steak & Lobster Mash. All sounding super yummy!!

Our server switched mid-way apparently because her shift was done. So Server #2 took our orders instead, and she seemed slightly unprofessional in terms of posture, her words, etc... Or maybe I'm just picky.

\"Butter\" because it doesn't taste like butter at all... And the bread has small pieces of raisins (I'm assuming.. could be totally wrong) inside which has a light taste with a hard crust which is really nice.

After a few minutes of wait, our steaks have arrived!!
Both of them look so bloody amaaaazing and mouth-watering. Mmmmm.

V's Mushroom Truffletta Steak (MTS) came with Steak drizzled with Truffletta mushroom and sauce along with mashed potatoes and side veggies consisting of snow peas, carrots and cauliflower.

My Steak & Lobster Mash (SLM) came with a typical steak (sadly) along with my lobster infused mash(!!!) and the same side veggies. I thought my steak would come along with some sort of sauce, but it was just a usual steak :( .

Super super satisfied with my lobster mashed potatoes as I was afraid that they'd be stingy with the lobster pieces. But look how big it was! There was at least 8 big pieces and couple of mini bites here and there. Super duper yummy for sure.

Calling for the bill took forever, our server was gone and we were the only ones within that area... So no one was walking around our area to serve us. We waited quite a bit before she came back and offered us the dessert menu but we just wanted the bill.

Our total came up to about $80(?) I believe, including tips. We don't usually eat at fancy places or steak that often to be honest, but once in awhile is alright with us."}
{"text":"If someone told me I would be dreaming about comfort food from Canyon Creek tonight, I would've told them to slap their mama cuz she taught them pure foolery! And yet, here I lay, slowly drifting into Narnia, reminiscing on my lunch there.

It was a work lunch so part of the beauty is that I didn't pay. I ordered the gourmet meatloaf and although I didn't understand the \"gourmet\" part, it was really good. The meatloaf was soft and perfectly covered in it's own portabello gravy. It sat on top mashed potatoes that were light and creamy. Now it claimed to come with sweet charred carrots; however the 3 carrot pieces I found on my plate wouldn't even make a whole carrot. The dish didn't really need it. It also didn't need the onion ring-like garnish on top.

All in all, the food was definitely better than my first experience. It's definitely moved up in my view of restaurants to choose along Front St. for lunch. Since the meatloaf isn't on the dinner menu, I'll have to see if Canyon Creek can have me dreaming about good food for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food and good ambience. Paid a visit to celebrate a spontaneous \"no special day celebration day\" with my wife. It was worth the risk. Servers were very pleasant except for one small blunder. This review is for a visit that was few years ago. But, must share about the Asian Nachos.

The food was great. The highlight of our dishes was the appetizer, Asian Nachos. If I am going there again, it is because if this particular dish. The photos posted only shows the visual appeal. Try it, you won't regret it. The only issue was, the appetizer came after the main meal. However, their customer service is highly commendable. Did not hesitate to apply a service recovery act. Bravo!

The dining area was a little cramped up but does not deter from having a nice romantic dinner. My wife loved  the experience.

The servers were very pleasant and quick to respond.

Asian Nachos!!!"}
{"text":"My rating should be taken as closer to a 3.7/5 stars. 

We each ordered from the special fixed menu which is $36 and includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. They also provide bread with a honey butter spread which was a nice compliment to start off with. 

I got the caesar salad, prime rib with loaded baked potato and the creme brulee which had pumpkin spice in it, as the waiter put it \"for fall\". 
My date had the chipotle marinated top sirloin with goat cheese butter with loaded baked potato. Same app and dessert. They actually gave us the mashed potato by accident even though we asked for the loaded baked potato, but hey, more for us! 

Food was really delicious and plenitful. Large portions so each of us took a bit of our food home. The steaks were seasoned really well, cooked perfectly and the cuts were really great, nice amount of fat which of course is partly what makes a great steak delicious. Salad was great, lots of bacon and parm. Creme brulee was good as well. I gave it 3.7 because comparing to The Keg, the quality of the chops are better at The Keg, but I would still recommend this place as an alternative. 

Ambience is dim and the seating arrangements are private and spaced out nicely. Lots of cosy booths. 

We also had a great waiter, name was Kenny."}
{"text":"Canyon creek is usually good, but this place is full of poor service and poor excuses."}
{"text":"A great place for large groups--very attentive, especially quick to bring you your cocktails which is always sooo appreciated after a long weekend of work. 

The bacon wrapped scallops and crab cakes were delicious, as well as the chive and sour cream mashed potatoes (YUM). By the time my entree arrived, I was already full from the delicious and generously portioned appetizers and salad, but the few bites I was able to get down made me wish I had saved more room. 

To top it all off, free WiFi! This was especially appreciated since my iPhone carrier is US based, so being able to actually use it to check emails, etc., without paying for internet use or racking up a ridiculous international usage fee was icing on the cake. 

We come here ever year after our conference is over, and I am hoping that we return next year because I'm already looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"The food just gets worse and worse here. We arrived to an empty restaurant the other evening. We ordered the Korean chicken appetizer which tasted like Indian or middle eastern spiced chicken, then the main courses arrived with the ribs being salty and dry and the filet mignon under flavoured. Now we know why this place was empty during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"3.5 for me. I came here with my dad and bf and we ordered the sirloin/tenderloin, prime rib and seafood linguine. Overall the meal was pretty good but nothing was outstanding. The portion size was okay but my bf said the prime rib was not that great - I tried a bit and it was kinda tough and not that fresh. My sirloin and tenderloin were pretty good, but the tenderloin piece they gave me was mostly fat. My dads linguine was decent too but it wasn't over the top amazing or anything. Service was decent. Would I come back? Not sure, there are so many steakhouses these days and this probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I always overlooked Canyon as a place to go for drinks and/or dinner but I'll definitely keep it in mind now. My family and I came here for lunch one day and we were all very happy with the food and service. My dad ordered the garlic shrimp ravioli and the rest of us all got prime rib which was AAA+ Perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare resulting in a juicy a** piece of meat. My parents don't typically like Canadian food as it's usually bland and crappy but were still raving about their experience days later. New family go-to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"How come this is only rated as 3 star? This is indeed FIVE.

I was driven by the summerlicious and lead to a mystery but luxurious and huge  basement at 1145pm. Then I was welcomed by Canyon Creek staff whom treated me as a VIP. Everyone just smiled and led you to the table you prefer. No hard sales, no leaving you to a miserable corner, no anything unpleasant. I kind of felt embarrassing just to order the $15 summerlicious lunch, but the server was such sweet and even recommending me a perfect entree in the list \"the grilled chicken breast\".

Berry Salad. Morning-picked green leaves, a few strawberry and blueberry, and just the right amount of berry sauce sprayed on the top. You won't notice it, but you will feel it. Superb.

Grill chicken breast. Huge portion. Skin was perfectly marinated with full but not exaggerated cumin aroma. Meat itself was fully cooked while maintaining the tenderness.

Lemon pie. Also good. but I am not a huge dessert fan though.

For $15 this was almost a bankrupt sale order. I was more than willing to pay for it even if this is $30.

Also thank you the graceful girl serving me right to the end. In such a busy environment she was still paying all her effort while maintaining her elegance.

I was amazed how dedicated and united their staff were, you just can feel it. This restaurant will be a perfect Bank's Lunch location, beating the adjacent J.A. hands down."}
{"text":"I have had a recent string of bad service recently. Perhaps I should stop going to chain restaurants. Pretty sure I said this already too lol

Canyon creek is as good as the keg and I ordered the steak 12oz

We ordered drinks ice teas and coke but their machines had no more co2 so the drinks came out flat. We let the server know and I think he took our comments personally. After this our server did not care to serve us anymore.

He took our order and the steaks came out in shallow bowls. How odd to serve steaks in bowls. It was not overly busy so not sure the reasoning but it made all the au jeux go all over my side. I am a very particular person and I don't like my sauces mixing with my other food as I am not a fan off sauces to begin with, I asked the server if I can get a plate but it never came... We told the server it was our friends bday and he did not offer anything for her celebration.

This location normally gives great service. Perhaps the server was having an off day which is understandable but for $80 I would like good service which was not present in this visit.

We wanted desert but we went elsewhere. Not once were we asked if our food was good. The food gets 5* but thee service gets 2*! 

The women servers are more attentive to their tables!"}
{"text":"Food ok 3 stars had prime rib just ok not seasoned enough l9aded baked potatoes bland.
But service 1 star was seated promptly and order taken but downhill from there. Didn't see waiter til I flagged him down. Noone bussed our table til I had to ask the waiter when we were ordering desert! Still left water and drink empty  glasses on table when we left.
Lots of hostesses no busboy. 
I don't really think there the only restaurant in the area across from Sherway"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Haven't been in several years, and, wow, have things changed.  No more pork chop -- a signature dish. The Good:  Chicken tacos, and the warm bread and honey butter.  Burger was good but very expensive for the size. The Bad:  Chicken Club Sandwich was the most boring and expensive sandwich I've ever had.  Chicken breast was paper-thin. It wasn't a two-layer sandwich as a club usually is.  No mayo as advertised.  Worst of all, no bacon.   The \"skinny fries\" were inedible.  The Save:  The manager comped the sandwich. (Good thing, as I only ate half.). Won't be back unless they seriously revamp the menu again."}
{"text":"Ate here twice while we were in Toronto for a week. The first time the server was absolutely awful - young guy, super flustered and after he gave us our food he totally disappeared! We had to stand up at our table, look around and flag another waiter down to pay our check... weird? Food was really slow coming out, but very good. The second time was Fantastic! A whole new experience! We were a party of eight and our waiter (young woman, wish I could remember her name!) was highly attentive, friendly, made perfect recommendations on food and wine - we never lacked for anything. The food was delicious - most of us had steaks, all were perfect. The ambiance of the place is dark but cozy and the prices alittle high - typical for the area but definitely worth it here."}
{"text":"Dropped in for their happy hour deals on a Wednesday: 5oz wine for the price of an 8oz! 
Wasn't planning on eating dinner but oh well, life happens. My friend and I while enjoying the cheap wines decided to order the Asian nachos, they came and we conquered-- great choice and enough for two to share. 
After another round of wine we decided to order mains, I opted for the fried chicken whilst my companion ordered the bandera chicken tacos. Canyon creek while it may not be my favorite for steak didn't disappoint on the portions and presentation. Both dishes were good but I found the slaw overly spiced and couldn't finish it. Trust me I like my heat but not like this. The tacos were good but need two soft shells as they become soggy if taken too long to bring in from the kitchen. 
Final verdict: happy hour has good deals especially Thursday and Friday's. The apps are great but mains need some work. See you next time between 5-7pm!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when I received a coupon in my mailbox in regards to their prix fixe menu. I figured why not? I have never been before. Well I'm so glad I did go! I have gone twice in the past month! So it's a must to try this place out. Each visit I have done the prix fixe menu options, I feel like it's a better deal and the food is amazingly delicious. 

I started off with the caesar salad, just your typical salad. Nothing real special. However, I can't say the same for the main course. Word to the wise: Order the Chipotle Sirloin! It is mind boggling delicious! I mean I ate everything, even the veggies and I would of licked the plate clean but, I have standards haha. Of course, dessert had to be ordered and lately they have been featuring a white chocolate & raspberry brulée.. My mouth is literally watering right now as I write this review thinking about it. When I say you need to order this, I mean it. Order it! Who doesn't like breaking the top of a brulée but when it tastes like heaven, even better! 

I will definitely be returning to this place, the service and food are just right!"}
{"text":"Really good steak house. Steak is always seasoned to perfection but is never exactly coined to perfection. Make sure to ask for bread and butter you will need it. The butter is home made infused with honey and the bread always comes warm.  can't wait to go back again do a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Went back a second time. Had a better experience dinning on the restaurant side. We ordered the prime rib sliders. They were amazing but sadly you only get 3. It's on the menu under \"shareables\" so it seemed odd that they give 3 & not 4. We agreed we'd just order the prime rib sandwich next time.
The calamari sat heavy. Very greasy. Delicious, but we both felt ill after it. 
The big fireplace in the back is nice."}
{"text":"Lunch with a large group to celebrate a special occasion. The staff was very polite and efficient and even surprised us with complimentary champagne. 

The fish tacos however, were just mediocre. Actually average at best. However, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. 

Still a great place for a large gathering."}
{"text":"Lunch menu ends @ 3:30p. Some dinner options are on the lunch menu so choose wisely. Honey butter is definitely a bonus treat, it's whipped so easy to spread. The review would have been a 5 star unfortunately the Prosecco was served warm and the balsamic vinaigrette was only olive oil.  Our server Daniel was very attentive and quickly corrected our problems."}
{"text":"Came here for a pre-Christmas lunch with my relative. As this was a last minute arrangement, glad I gotten a reservation the week before the holidays start. They got the Open Table online booking, this helps a lot when picking up the phone just ain't feasible.

Onto the food, I ordered a club sandwich for lunch and it wasn't bad at all. I can't say it's super tasty, cause it wasn't. But the server's go to attitude is the winner here. So I will come back to try other stuff. Cause Canyon Creek is more known for their steak and ribs segment as opposed to a club sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food! The chipotle sirloin steak was fantastic! Spicy but not overwhelmingly so. And not as tough as a regular sirloin. The baja fish tacos were super tasty, they come in a group of three, and on a corn tortilla. 

Courtney was a great server. She had fantastic suggestions and looked after us very well. With her guidance we had great food and a great time. 

Thanks canyon creek for a good evening!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and been here twice.  The problem I have with this place is service and price.  Their steaks are more expensive than the Keg and not that much better (if anything slightly worse), but the Keg does have great steaks.  On my visit last night, we waited 15 minutes for a server and then had to wait another 15 minutes for our beverages. The worst part is that all I asked for was water and coke. Got the coke but had to ask three times for water!! I am okay with slow service for food, but beverages should take no more than 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"The quality seems to have gotten better, albeit the portions have not.  The new menu items are really tasty.  I have really been enjoying Canyon Creek Of late.I like their Ceasar salad, albeit its a lot smaller in comparison to Scaddabouche, I liked everything i have tasted so far, which includes the thai lettuce wraps, the prime rib fettuccine, the prime rib, the ribs (a little on the small side) and their spinach dip.  The servers are quite friendly And do not hesitate to provide their recommendations.  It is a bit too dark inside though.  The place is full of booths, which really creates a privatized and intimate feel.  Their prime rib is delicious! The accompanying fully loaded baked potato was not skimpy on the cheese.  Had been having a good time the last few times I've been here and I definitely wanna go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM just behind Vaughan Mills. 

Came here with my coworkers & this is wayyyyyyyyy better then the Keg. Its also has more options then the Keg. This place is like a Ruby Tuesday's in the States. Good service & lovely staff. I'm also addicted to their honey oat/7 grain bread with sweet butter mmmhmm"}
{"text":"I booked our office Christmas luncheon at Canyon Creek in December and everyone had a lovely time.  The set menu choices offered were excellent!  I checked out several other restaurants in the area and Canyon Creek was the best by far as far as value and options available.

We were seated in a private room and we were able to put decorations and gifts at each seat.
We had 2 servers taking care of our group and they were fantastic.  There were about 15 of us there and we didn't have to wait long for our food - which was a huge plus.  The only thing I would have to say about the service is that I had pre-ordered appetizers and we didn't receive all of the items I had ordered in advance.  Also, with the steak, some people were offered onions and extra sides and others in our group weren't even asked if they wanted the extras on the side.  We also were not notified that the onions and extras for the steak cost extra!  The charges were added to the bill, much to our surprise.  Nonetheless, we all had a great time.  The food was amazing.  

The location was very central to the 401/427/QEW, and there were plenty of nearby hotels for those who wanted to stay the night.

We even received a $50 gift card as a thank you for booking!  What a great gesture!!  I definitely plan on visiting Canyon Creek again, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"So I was in Canada for 4 days and I had my last \"canadian\" meal here. Unfortunately for me, it sucked. Big time. 

My friend decided to take me here for lunch before my flight since it's close to the airport. We were immediately given a booth, so that was great. Once we sat down, we were immediately greeted by a really sweet waitress. Unfortunately for my friend and I, we actually had a different waitress who was not sweet nor friendly at all. I thought canadians were known for their friendliness, I guess this one didnt get the memo. Anyway, so we ended up ordering calamari and bacon cheeseburger to share (since we werent feeling that hungry and I didnt want to be super full before the flight). She looked annoyed when we said that we will be sharing the burger but she did offer to have the chef/cook put it in separate plates.

We got the complimentary bread which tasted okay but still kinda meh. The calamari was the worst that I've ever tasted. I have had calamari that were cheaper but still tasted 10 times better than the calamari I had in Canyon Creek. It was soggy, very oily, and the batter was so bland, I don't think they even put salt in it. Thank God the burgers were not that bad. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. It has the right meat, bun, vegetable ratio. Instead of the fries, we opted for the Caesar salad. It was okay, I mean, how great can a Caesar salad get right? Anyway, so we decided to get dessert, since our waitress were giving us a stink eye since we only ordered two items. We went with the brownie with the vanilla ice cream. This one sucked as well. The brownie was very dry, the texture is kinda sandy. We didn't even bother finishing it because it was that bad.

I feel like the waitresses here are stuck up in general, only a couple were nice to us. My friend asked for directions on where the washroom is and the waitress didnt even bother looking at him, she just pointed on where it was. I got the same treatment. Normally when I ask a waitress a question, he/she would smile at me and politely answer my question. Plus, I had to effing wave my hand just so I can have a refill on my drink. Hello, do you know what customer service is? 

I had a great time in Canada, but man, this place just annoyed the heck out of me. Not the best way to end a really great trip."}
{"text":"loved the food! The Peruvian fried chicken appetizer was absolutely delicious! The chocolate molten lava cake was also delicious. It was just the right portion size to not feel guilty for indulging."}
{"text":"Our favourite place to dine in Mississauga! Food is always just amazing and service is great."}
{"text":"Good sized menu, has enough steak variety without being overkill. The coffee crusted  steak is a unique spin and I thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"If you're trapped out in the airport area looking for food, this is a good place to eat! The surrounding area tends to be a food wasteland so we were thrilled to have a good meal here. 

Our first order was the sliders, which consists of shaved prime rib with horseradish and a real au jus. A real treat when you can never handle the size of an actual prime rib. There is no compromise on the quality of the meat, and the horseradish is nice and hot.
We also sampled the prime rib Quesadilla (yes, we were on a red meat kick) which while not as yummy as the sliders, was very tasty.

Our third appetizer and one of our favourites was the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. They came with a good variety of julienne vegetables (carrots, onion, snap peas, amongst others) with a beautiful lemongrass aroma. They were served with exactly the right amount of bib lettuce, with two choices of sauce. We particularly liked the tongs they provided, making it clean and easy to fill your lettuce leaf.

We also indulged in one of the two soup offerings. Again, on the red meat theme, we enjoyed a prime rib and vegetable soup. This delicious soup could best be described as a stew, and when served with lots of freshly ground pepper, it was a real taste treat.

Finally, perhaps the most pleasant surprise of all - an incredible crisp, fried, chicken breast sandwich served with a jicama buttermilk coleslaw and jalapenos. The meat was tender and juicy, and the thin batter managed to provide a crisp texture without being greasy."}
{"text":"This place is great for groups - I came for a birthday with a group of about 15. Food all came out at once which was nice and the waiter handled our large party well. Other than service, the food was okay - pretty standard western food. Nice atmosphere, but expect to pay anywhere between $15-$30+ for an entree."}
{"text":"Summary: upscale restaurant has decent service and somewhat satisfying but not excellent food

Top Must-Get: the complimentary bread comes with honey butter; steak soup
Top Regret: prime rib

Their lamb chops used to be so darn good. Alas, they changed the menu a couple years ago...

We came here on a Thursday for a celebration. I remembered the lamb chops being so good here back then, but to my dismay, they've pulled it from the menu.

We arrived around 7:30 pm and were seated right away. They were a bit slower to take our order though. The server checked in to see if we were ready at 7:35 pm, and when we weren't, didn't come back until 7:45 pm, which seemed a bit excessive. 

We both went with the prix fix option that comes with a starter, main and dessert for $36. Our order was punched in around 7:48 pm, and the bread came within 5 minutes. It seemed we switched servers as the young man who introduced himself to us was not the person who ended up serving us throughout the meal. Strange?

Their bread is not made in house, but the honey butter that comes with it is very good.

Starters came within 10 minutes

The Starters (7:55 pm)
Steak Soup: pretty good, chunks of steak actually in there
Garden Salad: they were light on the dressing which is how we like it

The Mains (8:18 pm)
Prime Rib with Mash: people recommended this, and maybe it's because two recent restaurants I went to had REALLY amazing prime rib (Copacabana and Paninoteca), but this one just didn't do it for me. It was tender, but not in the same way, and I didn't love the horse raddish. It came with mashed potatoes, and the sauce didn't go as well with it as I hoped.

Salmon: well, this was okay. The green sauce tasted like blended peas, so if you're into that...

Dessert:
The double chocolate brownie is, predictably, extremely sweet. Again, if you're into that...


It was nice to come back to relive memories of that lamb chop I had years ago, but that'll probably be it. It's a nice environment but not really worth the price point."}
{"text":"Started off with the free bread and it was good but it wasn't the same brown bread they used to serve which I liked better. I love the chipotle sirloin from this place! It was part of the prix fix menu for $40 So I went for that.  Picked Caesars salad for my appetizer which was good.  Chipotle sirloin for my entree, vegetables were cooked well and tried the mashed potato with it which was also pretty good.  I still prefer the fries over the mash from previous visits.  I ordered bumbleberry cheesecake for dinner but we took that to go and my niece took it home.  Ordered prime rib sliders as well which was yummy especially when you dip it in the jus that came with it."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Great convenient location. 
I was surprised to see it so empty at 20:00 on a Saturday night. 
Went for the Cesar's , prime rib , Creme brûlée on the prix fixe.
The food was great."}
{"text":"Decided to try out a new restaurant and saw this near our hotel on yelp. My boyfriend and I shared the fish tacos appetizer and the regular burger with fries. 
The fish tacos were my least favourite. The sauce was way too juicy so it made it really hard to eat. The fish was pretty bland but the Taco all together was pretty intense with Mexican flavors. 
The burger was made perfectly. Juicy and had a good ratio between the two buns. The fries here are skinny fries and are perfectly seasoned and really yummy. 

Our service was good. We were seated right away and served pretty fast. Our food came all together in about 10-15 min. The bread that was given to us before our orders was amazing. The butter spread was so yummy, my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it. 

Overall it was a good experience and I would love to come again and try their other items!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent drinks. Excellent food. 

Came here on a Saturday at 9pm. No wait. Service was incredibly professional and our waiter was friendly and attentive. Drinks were delicious. I had the Hemingway Daiquiri (Havana Club 3 year rum, Luxardo Maraschino, lime, grapefruit) which hit the spot. For dinner, I had the 7 oz top sirloin with russet mashed potatoes. It was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were incredible. Dessert was a bumbleberry cheesecake with pecan crust. 

I would definitely come back often if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I have no complaints, our evening went swimmingly and our waitress was accommodating. I'm a fan of Canyon Creek restaurants and have never had any bad experiences. We ordered their draft beer sampler and their Winter Prix Fixe menu, 2 starter salads, 2 8oz Prime Rib and 2 desserts (s'mores brownie and Lindt+Baileys Creme Brulee). Everything was delicious and would definitely come back again. Price is the same as other locations, and food is on par with the other locations as well."}
{"text":"I really like the service and they're always very accommodating. I have been here twice and both occasions were very pleasant. The servers are super nice and I have never had any issues with their food. I enjoy eating steak and I love that they're not stingy with their sides. I hate ordering a meal and you get two strands of beans and that's it. Overall, I am a fan."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 7 were seated quickly and even got a private room.  Our server Jeff was the best.  The food was great."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  $36 special included great Caesar salad, best prime rib AND a hot brownie sundae       This is a no brainer.  Great staff too."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I'm still not a fan. The customer service is excellent here, but their food is merely OK and overpriced. It tries too hard to be upper middle class, and I much prefer the food offered at Jack Astor's (which is owned by the same group of companies)."}
{"text":"Amazing what changes under better management

We had a great meal with their new menu with excellent service

For starters the Asian Nachos are  a twist with crispy egg roll wafers with asian influenced toppings with a thick soy syrup

The Kansas City steak soup was a well sized portion

The steaks were all cooked to perfection with the typical sides

I had the planked salmon which was cooked to perfection with asparagus and basmati rice. It was grilled nicely and the plank was charred. Nice plating shows some care in the kitchen line

Wine bottles are well priced

No room for dessert but they have a happy hour special with apps $5 and manhattans or glasses of Behringer for $5"}
{"text":"Years ago, this used to be my favourite haunt in the area. Then the quality of the food really went downhill, and I called it a day. 

In the past month, I ended up there twice, once not of my own volition, because of a business meeting, and the second time I went there by choice, as it turned out the place has greatly improved, almost back to its old glory. 

I'm rating it at 4 as opposed to by stars, as one of the meals on the second visit was somewhat overdone, but it was still decent. 

Love the steak salad - the glazed nuts are a nice touch. 

Will repeat."}
{"text":"So disappointed. 

How do I start.. deco in the restaurant is on point. Environment is nice and the waitress is pretty nice as well.

The problem is the food. I ordered from the prix fix menu ($34) with a salad, a chipotle steak and a crepe brûlée.

The best dish was the creme brûlée...

Steak was so hard.. I can't even bite into it properly. With such hefty price point I rather go to Joeys.."}
{"text":"This is only my second time going to Canyon Creek - I'm very much a KEG Steakhouse girl and while I still love The Keg I must say Canyon Creek is a great #2. Our bill came to just under $100 - thanks in part to a $10 discount I received after joining the Canyon Club. My date and I had the Baja Fish Tacos to start - which were just okay. We could've done without them. Let me tell you, I need to find a recipe or recipe dupe for the honey butter they serve with their bread - it is to DIE for. I wanted to try their pasta but opted for a steak since most reviews said they have the best steaks in the province. We ordered the Chipotle Sirloin and it was really good ... a TAD bit too much oil on my plate but it was very tasty and cooked to perfection. I'm taking a star off for the rock hard veggies - they were barely steamed and quite raw - which isn't a major issue - if I ASKED for raw veggies. We ordered a pitcher of their sangria and it was really good - you could actually taste the alcohol which for me is a plus because there is nothing I hate more than a watered down alcoholic beverage. For dessert we shared their chocolate brownie and it was really good except when they brought it, the ice cream was almost all gone and melted all over the plate. Unfortunately with the extra oil and melted ice cream on my plate, I gotta take off another star for presentation - while the taste was there, the dishes didn't LOOK appetizing. Our server was really good and knew the menu well - when we asked for his opinion and input he had an answer at the ready. Toward the end of the night (when it was less busy) he kind of disappeared and we had to look for him to bring our bill but other than that he was really good."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and portion size ! I had the most AMAZING salad I have ever tasted hands down! Asian steak salad- medium rare strips of steak, baby greens, goat cheese topped with crispy chinese noodles or flakes (not sure exactly what it was but it was heavenly!) and a sweet chili dressing. My husband ordered the lobster cobb which was also very good. For appetizer we had this loaf of french bread stuffed with mozzarella and sundried tomatoes, drizzled with olive oil and topped with fresh tomatoes."}
{"text":"Had dinner here.  Ordered the prime rib (medium rare).  The au jus was tasty and the meat was tender.   Had the pumpkin spice creme brulee, the sugar coat on top was nice and thick.  It was very much like eating bits of candy with it.  

The waitstaff though, wasn't really on top of keeping the waters topped off.  But I would definitely come back and visit."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's celebration of becoming an official Canadian citizen! YAY!

There were about 15 of us ordering from the specials menu (FYI $5 drinks and $5 off selected appies from 5pm on Wednesday and Thursdays). Our waitress was as nice as she could be (all things considered, it was super busy).

I asked for a water along with my wine and received a glass complete with a lipstick ring around the top, which was super gross. I pointed out to the waitress that I was not wearing lipstick and she apologized and brought me a fresh glass. I tried not to think about it too much .... EW. 

I opted the fried fish tacos and they were just ok. A bit cold actually but not bad. I was just hungry at that point and ate them pretty quickly. 

I would return but strongly caution everyone to check your drinking glasses for presents left behind by other patrons ;)"}
{"text":"The service is slow perhaps the pace of life is slower than the hustle and bustle of New York where \"time is essence\" but somewhat attentive.  The steaks are okay but not U.S.D.A. prime standards or quality.  I came here for dinner after a six-hour long haul drive from New York City for a funeral service weekend of my former love's relative.  It was filling to my appetite after enduring car sickness.  The Lingonberry sauce which my former love's relative ordered was very tasty."}
{"text":"A good friend came to visit us from out of town and we decided to meet at Canyon Creek to catch up and have a nice dinner.  Our friend arrived at the restaurant first, so I was promptly seated when we arrived at Canyon Creek.

My first impression of Canyon Creek is a classy dine in restaurant with nice decor and comfortable seats.  The service we received at the restaurant was excellent throughout the evening, so that reinforced our first impression. 

After browsing the menu, we decided to order the $37 three course price fixe menu.  For my three courses, I ordered garden salad, steak for the main course and creme brule for dessert.  The wait for our food was not too long, and our salads came fairly soon after we placed our orders.

My garden salad was average.  I found the vinegar taste a little bit strong in the balsamic vinegarette dressing.  The salad came with the usual ingredients: lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onions etc. I ate the salad, although I would have preferred a lighter salad dressing.

My main course came soon after we finished our salads.  My order was a medium-well done steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables and I got exactly what I ordered.  A medium-well done steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  The steak was delicious and I thought the quality of meat for the steak was excellent.  Nothing special to add about the mash potatoes or the vegetables.  Everything was tasty and I cleaned out my plate.

There was a slightly longer wait between the main and the dessert but I didn't mind since I was feeling full and it gave me and my friend more time for conversations.

When the desserts came I was impressed by the high quality creme brule.  The hard icing on the creme brule was crisp and not too sweet and the filling inside was delicious.  Although I was still full from the steak I ate earlier, I ate the whole creme brule because it was very tasty.

Overall, I enjoyed excellent food and excellent service at Canyon Creek.  It's worth checking out if you're looking for a fine dining experience.

{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends before seeing a movie, which the theatre is conveniently located within the same general parking lot. We came right around Christmas so parking was a complete nightmare as well as turning in left off Rathburn, highly suggest coming in a different way if possible during this time of year. The restaurant itself is very nice, low lighting, clean and the staff is super friendly. We had a great table by the fireplace.
For appetizer I got in on the salsa and what I believe was artichoke dip, whatever it was it was great and the Tortilla chips were delicious. I ordered the veggie burger with salad. Let me tell you how the veggie burger was so good and so on point I had to make my friend taste it to confirm they didn't mess up and give me meat. I asked for no goat cheese and the toppings were great. The salad I could take or leave, I am just trying to be good and stop getting fries on the side lol. 
I think that this is a great option if you work around here for after work, or you're seeing a movie or doing some shopping. It is in such a busy section that I feel like I would have to have other purpose to come here, not just to eat."}
{"text":"If it hadn't been for the awful steak, I would have given this 3 stars! Admittedly, I went for a Winterlicious-type menu, so perhaps if I'd ordered the steak at full price it might have been better, but honestly it was mushy and stringy and tough all at the same time. I've cooked better steaks than that - and that's the one thing I think can only be done well at a steakhouse! 

However, there are some great points to Canyon Creek. If I am to compare solely to The Keg (and I love the Keg): 

- ambiance cozy (but I like the Keg better)
- the Caesar salad is really great 
- shrimp (as part of my surf'n'turf) were awesome 
- great honey butter with the grains bread 
- no problems with the wine list 
- Keg desserts better (but who can top the Billy Miner pie?)

Thus, I say: go to the Keg instead if you have the option!  But do join the Canyon Creek email list. They have AMAZING deals on wine each Thursday. It would be worth the trip just for that (and the Caesar salads)!"}
{"text":"Well, the music mix was solid.  How about that?   Service was very friendly and timely.   Food - meh.  Think TGIFridays, but a step up."}
{"text":"Loved this steak house... Toronto is easily becoming one of my favorite destinations and restaurants like this are why!

My food was so good, it came out super fast and my waitress was so nice. After having a NY Strip Steak, this Canadian hotspot has my native NY'er stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"I went there with a group on a Friday evening. As soon as we sat down the waiter came by within minutes, introduced himself and said he will give us a few mins. He came back after a few mins and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered and just as he was ready to walk away, I had to stop him asking if he could get us drinks. I expected to be asked if we wanted drinks during his introduction. So we get our bread with sweet butter... Amazing. And after 5 mins from placing our dinner order with our waiter, our dinner arrives but all the orders were messed up. I was surprised that the food came so quick. After finally getting the right orders, The steak was flavorful and tender. The buttery mash potatoes lacked flavour. Then ordered desert.. Really good and all made in house. The food good.  Service... Not so much.  I prefer the keg over this location. Service and food are way better."}
{"text":"This was our first time there! And we are extremely disappointed. Two stars is being generous and only because our waiter was phenomenal. 

Server: Viger (probably not spelled right) was amazing! He was pleasant and smiling and he was super attentive and friendly! 

Food: we had the shrimp appetizer and for the price it wasn't worth it. We got 5 shrimp. It tasted ok but we've had better. We also had the dip which was also not the greatest as it didn't have much flavour. We had steaks, pasta and fish. The steak was not very good. Mine was rare but extremely cold. The keg has much better steak. My husband was ok he had the chipotle one. My friend had the trout and he said it was salty and so was the sweet potato that came with it. My other friend had the seafood pasta it wasn't very saucy and didn't have much seafood. East Side Mario's seafood pasta is much better! 

Dessert: the boys had Nanaimo bars which they said didn't taste fresh and it was the sweetest one they ever had. I had cheesecake it was meh 

Overall for the price that we paid it wasn't worth it. will not be returning. 

Bathroom: ladies bathroom didn't smell so great. It also had cob webs in the corners and on top of some stalls."}
{"text":"Canyon Creek's were always on my list of go to steak houses when I wanted to go a bit more upscale. My favourite item was the steakhouse salad, a huge slice of beefsteak tomato covered with chopped red onion, avocado, blue cheese and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. I found it unusual and addictive. But then it disappeared until now! The new version is slightly different.  Now the salad is made up of chopped small tomatoes, avocado, crumbled bacon, onions and an Italian dressing. Different, not quite as good, but still pretty good!

Because I was stopping in late, I didn't want to eat too much so I had the new salad, and a prime rib sandwich. The meat was carved really thick on the bun, and done a nice medium rare as requested. But it was a bit on the tough side, so it was a bit hard to bite off without having to rip and tear at it.

Not all changes are for the best. I wish I had the old salad back, and a more tender chunk of prime rib. I'll have to check back and see if it improves."}
{"text":"Went with a friend during our lunch break. The place is a bit like a dark cave since it's below ground, but on a hot day that's fine with me.
The service is spotty. Somewhat friendly but was very slow. Not a good spot to go if you have less than 1.5 hours to spend for lunch, as larger parties slowed things down for the individual tables. 
They also got my order wrong but we didn't say anything because we didn't want to slow things down. The meat was good, but the bun was stale. The mango sorbet was GROSS...it seemed that it may have thawed out, started to spoil and then re-froze."}
{"text":"I asked for the ribeye to not be marinated and to my suprise they said no problem. The ribeye was great and the garlic mashed ok. The waiter staff was fantastic no problems at all. I would go back again given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Last time I came to a canyon creek it was at the Square One location and the food and service sucked so I was skeptical about coming here again especially after becoming vegetarian. However, I'm so glad I did. Despite being a large group, the waiter was so friendly and kind to us and the service was excellent! I tried the veggie burger and it was the best veggie burger I have had since becoming a vegetarian. For dessert I tried the seasonal creme brulee (smores version), and it was delicious. I would love to come back to this location. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"??scarborough town centre????????????????????????????????d.????2??4??6????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????tim ,?????????????"}
{"text":"Came back with another pleasent experience. Compared to my last experience, the service was a whole lot better.  

The waiter was friendly, attentive, and professional. He definitely made his presence known, but comfortably enough for us to know he was around if we had any requests. We ordered an appetizer and a summer prix-fixe menu to share. What surprised me was that he had our set course, split evenly between the two of us. Of course, there is usually a plate sharing cost in most restaurants, but when asked, he smiled and said it was free.  

Ordered:
Canyon Creek dip - Consisted of 2 dips 1) a warm spinach dip w/cheese 2) salsa. The spinach dip was delightful. It wasn't heavy on the cheese, but satisfying to start off the meal. The salsa was a bit disappointing, nothing particularly special.

Summer prix-fixe menu ($29.95)
Chophouse salad - Consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, raspberry vinegrette, blue cheese. Overall, I didn't like this combination for my salad. Should have stuck with the caesar salad.

Prime rib w/ baked potato - Medium rare. I enjoyed it, but it was pretty standard. 

Warm apple cobbler w/ whipped cream - I found the apple cobbler a bit too sweet. It would have tasted a lot better if served with vanilla ice cream instead. 

Overall, a better experience; better service. I would come back if I'm in the district again."}

{"text":"In 6 years have never came here, overlooked the place. But after an aggressive marketing campaign due to the Keg opening  I gave it a try . Was surprised as often with Ontario chain restaurants there's paper on the tables  for the server to write there name in crayon . Yuk . This place was a nice decor, nice atmosphere and the food menu was good and  be the food was good. We were however jammed in a small booth, but all  in all I would recommend this place over 95% of the places . Nice job"}
{"text":"One of my favorite prime rib restaurants..you can never go wrong with this one (at least every time I have been there).
I have been to the square one location a few times and it has never disappointed. Service is excellent and the food comes out quite fast. Be sure you come hungry as they start you with some freshly baked bread with the oh so gooood honey butter!
I always order medium rare prime rib as my entree and it is spot on- the 6oz portion is just right for me or even  a tad too big but it is cooked to perfection!! The most recent visit was for a team lunch and since it was my first time here for lunch, I thought I would have to go with something else other than my usual- that didn't happen because they had a prime rib sandwich. Instead of the usual onion bread, I opted for sour dough bread and it was an amazing combination. It was so tasty that I was already thinking of my next visit lol! 
We also ordered a few apps to share, they included edamame, asian nachos, calamari and the Canyon Creek dip. Each of the items were really good although I thought the Asian nachos were a little too spicy for my liking. The portions were just right for 7 people since each of us had an entree. 
One thing I learned that day was that the square one location was a 'test' restaurant, which meant that this was where they tried out the new dishes before releasing them to the other Canyon Creek restaurant- super cool!

I can't wait to come back for my usuals as well as looking forward to the new items!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for business and my colleague and I were looking for somewhere quick to eat. So it was walking around time for us near our airport hotel. I wasn't too keen on franchise restaurants, but gastronomic concern was foremost. 

The staff was friendly and business like. This crew seem to jump out of Vogue magazine-- attractive waitresses. Standard Ironstone white wine and I think my buddy had beer. The staff was courteous and attentive to our bread and liquid needs. 

Maybe it was just travel pangs, but I liked the 'standard' starters of chophouse garlic bread (living near Gilroy CA, garlic capital of the world...I just love the stuff). The coconut shrimp, well , nothing to write home about. 

I had the pork chop, and I liked it a lot. Maybe it was the details of these little pepper crusts exploding in your mouth and not thinking about the airport security pat-downs, but it was good. Crunchy when bitten and nice and soft/tender as the other white meat should. Pork, who knew. Woofed that down...more cheap white wine please!! 

I think my buddy had the garlic Angus beef. He seemed to like that as well. Well presented, however I didn't have a bite so I have no opinion. 

After a couple of hours of this carnivore culinary bliss, we were off to our scheduled security scanners and pat-downs. Oh joy."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite steak houses to eat at. With their specials every wednesday and Thurdays Canyon Creek is the place to be. Yesterday they had $5 off any shareables, and $5 domestic beer, stella artois, local white and red wine.  If these options don't tickle your fancy, then you can always check out their menu.  
For shareables we had their Canyon dip; mozarella, spinach, feta dip with corn chips.  Secondly we decided to also try their Pakora chicken; dry rub seasoning cradled in what looked like a chaat papry crust shell that was complimented by a sweet dip. 
For the mains, we both went for their Sesame sirloin steak salad, which I believe is still one of the best steak salads I've ever had.
Overall abmience is awesome! our server was extremely sweet...i think her name was MIa...OR something along those lines. 
I'll be back next week lol...."}
{"text":"Coming here with some coworkers as part of Summerlicious, we decided to take advantage of their set menu.
Located steps from Union Station Canyon Creek is situated a row of quite popular restaurants and bars.
Taking the steps 'down' to the restaurant, the venue is quite spacious with its bar and dining area kept separate. 
For starters I decided to try their Tuna Tostada, 4/5 well presented, fresh slice of Tuna served on a Taco chip with a mango and ginger glaze. great starter with bang of flavor! 
The entree was 2.5/5 Peruvian crispy chicken bowl served with shredded veggies, guacamole, cilantro, peanuts and sesame drizzled with a lemon caper vinaigrette. Overall dish was OKAY, but had a kick of spice. the Chicken could have been marinated longer if anything. 
For dessert I tried their banana coconut cream pie served in a glass cup with layers of coconut cream custard, slice of banana and toasted coconut shavings on top...great way to end a meal. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"A fairly good chain steakhouse that's comparable to The Keg but better in my opinion (I've never found The Keg particularly impressive). The food is good, standard steakhouse fare. Prices are a little on the high side but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now over the past few years and both times were excellent so thought I'd write.  
The first time it was basically empty and we had excellent steak meals, and very good service. 
Last night, it was packed with the after work crowd getting in on the $5 drinks and appetizers deal.  The apps were great, I had a great local ale, and the service was, like the first time, excellent.  
This is an oasis in the dead zone which is Front St."}
{"text":"This place is only half decent. I went here with some friends during a surprise birthday dinner for another friend. The food and price was acceptable but nothing really did wow me for the night. Had a great time with friends. But no wow from this place"}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill. Portions are super small, looks like food from cafeteria at high prices. Used to be good when they gave you salad when you ordered steak. Mashed potatoes would also include stringy onion bits to round out the overall presentation.  I will never go here again even in I was invited by friends, I would politely decline."}
{"text":"Perfect quaint chop house centrally located right across from union station and across from  the convention center. Great spot for a power lunch for Power dinner! currently the scallops with the crispy shrimp on the bed of greens is a  fantastic appetizer.  Everyone my group had a steaks: including steak frittes, prime rib to the mushroom trufflelotta sirloin. All cooked to perfection accompanied by A variety of potatoes selections and assorted fresh cooked vegetables"}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday night and even though the section we were seated in had a large party already seated the service was pretty good.   We started with the Asian nachos and the Coconut Shrimp both of which were absolutely amazing.  The nachos which are served on Crisp wontons, with Thai chicken, vegetables,  and jack and cheddar were crispy with a little bit of heat and sweetness at the same time from the sesame glaze and lime sour cream.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the coconut pairs perfectly with the horseradish dijon dipping sauce.   
I had the Goat Cheese Chicken Penne for my main and I'm sad to say I was pretty disappointed.  I almost never order pasta but decided to take a chance this time but it was definitely a hit and a miss.   My date however had The Smoky Bacon Burger and it was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be getting a burger the next time I come. 
I truly enjoy the food, the ambiance, and the atmosphere here. Canyon Creek is slowly becoming one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"My spouse went here, and we came home with diarrhea after eating one of their bacon club sandwiches. We will not return!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Jonathan (Our server) was very tentative, even though there were large gaps between visits from him. I had a green salad and the mushroom steak.

Salad was well dressed but the greens were too cold, like they'd been sitting right under the blower in the fridge. Steak was cooked perfectly and mashed potatoes were delicious and veggies were great, but wish the quantity of the potatoes was a little more. Had to eat when i got home 2 hours later.

Great atmosphere otherwise, but the 3 star rating is due to the value for money, and it feels like i over-paid for not enough."}
{"text":"Delicious steaks.  This restaurant was in walking distance of the Intercontinental Hotel. We took a chance because it was convenient, and the food ended up being very good. Quaint, rustic, and rather quiet. Service was also good. My only complaint would be the size of the grilled salmon. One person in our group ordered that, and it seemed rather small. He was still hungry when he left the restaurant. Everyone else had sirloin, and they were delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. There was free bread which was crunchy outside and soft inside, served with their super delicious butter mixed with honey. That was the best butter I've had ever. I loved it. I ordered grilled chicken Caesar salad, and it was so yummy. The dressing was palatable and the vegetables were fresh and bacon was great. My friends ordered pasta and other dishes , they all had pretty good reviews on them. We really enjoyed the dinner. The server was good, environment was good. We were satisfied."}
{"text":"Ive been a here a while ago and I came because I had a coupon. We ordered the prime rib and what we got was a fatty prime rib. When we try to tell the waiter they insisted that it supposed to be fatty. We know prime rib has fat but it shouldn't be fat. They werent too happy and I thought they would give me a refund but instead they gave us a free dessert. I gave this place a two star  because I heard from others that it's a good place but I'm still waiting to return"}
{"text":"the food was okay, nothing special and way to overpriced for what it was, only 1 vegetarian option and it didn't look to good waitress was very friendly and gave great service"}
{"text":"Canyon creek never disappoints me.
No matter which location I go, it's always good service and great meal. We had calamari fritti to start. I love sundried tomatoes aioli, nice presentation and so yummy. Garden salad and Caesar salad also very fresh and crispy. We ordered chipotle sirloin, classic filet and Prime rib. From rare to med well, each steaks cooked just perfect. Our server was awesome."}
{"text":"Steaks always cook the way I want, it's very good. Service is always great. Sometimes they have prefix menu, inexpensive and good value. Love coconut shrimp, calamari and steaks."}
{"text":"This place can get loud. The free bread with honey butter, as others have noted, is what makes this place. It really needs a better craft/import beer selection. Service is quite spectacular and they have a lot of 1,000 point OpenTable bookings. Nothing to sneeze at there. I tell you."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place isn't bad. I've only been to this location, so I'm not sure how it stacks up against other locations in the city. I've had dinner at this spot twice now and I think my first visit was better than the last. 

I'm a filet mignon kinda gal, and lately, it's really the only steak I order when I go out. My friend ordered the prime rib. We both started with a Caesar salad, which was better than a lot of Caesars I've had in the past. 

Our entrées arrived shortly after, but sadly, both cuts of meat were over-cooked. Our server was very quick to address the problem, whisked away our plates and before too long, two new meals arrived and both were done perfectly. My filet was tender and juicy and my friend's prime rib was mouth watering! 

We also shared a bottle of wine, which was quite reasonably priced. Always nice to get a fair price for the cheaper wines when you don't want to spend an arm and a leg. 

I'd probably return if I was in the area, but for my money, nothing beats the Keg for a good steak!"}
{"text":"That is one of my favorite steak houses in the city. but not only thier peppercorn steak is amazing, but also thier grilled Salmon. And don't forget the dessert, hard to choose between the Molten chocolate, Double Chocolate Bownies with Vanilla icecream or the Brulee."}
{"text":"While service was great, food was subpar. Our waitress was very kind, friendly and attentive. However, the prime rib was bland, which killed the great atmosphere. I would not recommend this restaurant. There are many surrounding restaurants with great service, atmosphere AND flavorful food."}
{"text":"To start off, I had no idea what I wanted to drink so the bartender asked me a few short questions and came up with this concoction that was delicious.  At the table we started with the bread with honey butter that is awesome!!! The starter avocado bacon salad, delicious. We just substituted with goat cheese. The prime rib sandwich, delicious. The mushroom something steak, delicious. The staff, welcoming & friendly. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Located near St Andrews TTC station and in the financial district. Canyon creek restaurant is listed as a contemporary steakhouse.  Came here on a Wednesday around noon for a Winterlicious lunch.  Had to wait in line at the front desk for around 5 minutes.  Because the restaurant is below ground level lighting was very dim.  The modern decor is a mix between sports bar and lounge. 

Upon arriving to our table, each had cutlery, menus, glasses of water and a candle (with real flame). Items on the menu had a mix of western and Asian food which is a surprise.  Service was friendly but was slow in getting all our courses.  Restaurant looked to be about 80% full.  Was hoping to finish lunch within 1 hour but it was 45 minutes longer.  They were nice to give us extra bread when asked though it took about 30 minutes to get it and we were finishing up our mains.  

Candied Atlantic Salmon served with golden beets, citrus segments, pickled Bermuda onion and tangy horseradish crème fraiche.  Was the best dish I tried for this lunch.  Each bite had a different yet enjoyable taste.  Would highly recommend this dish.

Vietnamese Roast Beef Pho rice noodles in a rich and spicy beef broth with Thai basil, fresh bean sprouts and crispy wonton.  Friend said the beef was good but everything else didn't remind her of pho.  She still enjoyed it.

Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich crisply coated, topped with buttermilk jicama slaw, cilantro, chipotle mayo and jalapeño.  I tried a piece of the chicken and seemed dry but the fries were good.

Peach Crumble juicy peach chunks smothered in cinnamon brown sugar streusel and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  My friend said this dessert was realy good.

Salted Dark Chocolate Ganache decadent double chocolate with lemon zest, crème fraiche and a soft oatmeal crust.  Looked like a chocolate bar but tasted like chocolate mousse. Wasn't too sweet or bitter.  Portion size was small.

Carrot Cake made in-house with creamy molasses icing, caramel and candied pineapple.  Had a veriety of textures which I liked.  The flavours were average.  Probably wouldn't get this again.

Some food were better than others.  Most items I tasted were average and only item that stood out was the candied Atlantic Salmon.  If I had to order my courses again I'd go with Candied Atlantic Salmon, Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, and Salted Dark Chocolate Ganache.  Portion size was ok for lunch.  I would be interested in coming back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"An old Christmas gift card, (I'm talking last Christmas) to any of Circorp's fine establishments eventually led us to this Canyon Creek on Front. Figuring it would be a more relaxing atmosphere than Jack Astors and have better food than the Loose Moose, we ventured into the cavernous underground restaurant. 

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Our service was great, the food was fresh and the $12 Ontario Pinot Gregio  verrry good (Crush). 

For an appetizer we had the lamb meat balls in a mint sauce (very tasty) and bread with honey butter (delicious). The garden salad was fresh but the dressing overly vinegar-y. I had the cedar plank salmon which came with sour cream mashed potatoes. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were real. My man had the goat cheese stuffed chicken with a \"loaded\" baked potato ( grotesquely huge!). For dessert we had the tart cherries and whipped cream (very good. Real whipped cream and seriously tart cherries, which I love). 

Nothing overly innovative here but good simple comfort food. Dinner for two and our bill came to over $100 (including 2 glasses of wine, 2 pints and tax). These chain restaurants ain't cheap! Overall, if it weren't for our generous gift card we most likely wouldn't have dined here. Given the choice, to spend $100 on dinner again it would be somewhere more interesting than Canyon Creek (The Keg! I kid) But we were ultimately happy with our Circorp roulette results. 

Additionally: you can check the nutritional information of the dishes  online when you get home. Yikes."}
{"text":"There's tons of Canyon Creek's about around the GTA and this one definitely has convenience on its side.  It's in striking distance to the theatre district, Roy Thomson Hall (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/roy-thomson-hall-toronto), and the ACC (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/air-canada-centre-toronto) and Rogers Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rogers-centre-toronto) for all your sporting needs.

The bad side is it's just a Canyon Creek.  The staff is effective, efficient, and friendly enough.  The menu and quality is consistent with all that is the essence of Canyon Creek.  There's not much wrong with this place.  The sad part is that it's found in a row of similarly franchised places that don't bring anything new or exciting to the table, to be fair.  A steak is a steak.  A pork chop is a pork chop.  They're all tasty here and nothings offensive.  What makes this not work for me is the fact that you can get this anywhere.  A little more exploring in the area may do everyone some good."}
{"text":"Great food. Always come here for the prime rib. The prime rib never disappoints!!! This place has great service too! The place always hires the right people. They are always personable and easy to talk to. It getting hard to find good service in the city of Toronto but this establishment is on point on what a dining experience should be. Enough said - just head over now."}
{"text":"Went here once for a special occasion, and the steak was absolutely incredible. Fillet mignon was too small though, hence the star off. Other than that, everything was perfect, service and mood included."}
{"text":"Ordered the calamari, prime rib sliders, taco or wonton things, rib eye steak, cheesecake, & creme brulee.  EVERYTHING was done to perfection.  Service was good.  Environment was good.  We dined in a private room with a television showing a fireplace lol and the wood positions actually rotates if you pay attention.  Value was excellent.  Food was spectacular!  The prime rib is highly recommended!  The rib eye was to die for.  Usually for myself I find that most restaurants make the desserts too overly sweet for my liking, BUT this place made is PERFECT!  The sweetness to the creme brulee & cheesecake was done to perfection.  There is nothing that I would like to change about my experience.  Everything was perfect, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Family oriented restaurant. Ordered the Mother's Day special and was pleasantly surprised (trout and lobster/white rice) - it was delicious. Service was good and ambiance was inviting. Our server was just ok. He came to check up on us every so often (not often enough)."}
{"text":"My final bday dinner of 2017 (my bday was in February lol). Arrived at 4:45 on a Thursday evening. Not busy at all when we got there but the place was PACKED in no time. It IS, by the airport after all. Tons of big groups and parties.

I decided to order off the prix fix menu. I started with the Caesar salad, main was the prime rib with mash potatoes and for the dessert I got the warm brownie with vanilla ice cream. The bf got the Ontario top sirloin with mash and a side Caesar and our friend got the New York striploin with a garden salad.

Service was quick as we thankfully got our orders in before the large groups. Complimentary bread came out in an instant after ordering. Which is probably some of the best complimentary bread. Love that it's warm and looooove the sweet butter. Salads came soon after. The dressing was a little too garlicky and good thing I'm not a vampire because I ended up eating a whole clove that was in my salad. It was strong and my sweat will probably smell for 5 days, but garlic is good for you right? Mains weren't too far behind and came just after we all finished our salads. I was super disappointed because I've been craving prime rib for a week and that first bite was not as satisfying as I thought it would be. To be honest it was a liiitttle dry and chewy. Just the centre pieces. Outer pieces were much better. Not the worst I've had, but I was expecting more. I tried a piece of the New York striploin and that seemed a little juicer than my centre pieces. Overall it was okay. I still devoured it. The two left me to die and didn't even help me eat my dessert. I couldn't even finish it because I was going to explode. It was good though. The brownie was more of like a chocolate cake. I ate more than half of it but allll the ice cream. Ah duh! Brownie was nice and warm. The steam would rush out as you cut off a piece.

I've been to canyon creek on different occasions and decided to go again because I've never tried their prime rib. However, I'll stick to the Keg for my fix of prime rib. Will probably end up here again but defs will get something else."}
{"text":"I am booking a corporate event at this venue for my senior leaders in the private lounge for 30 people.  I have been chasing them for a set menu, as I have attendees who have diet restrictions (vegan, lactose intolerant, gluten intolerant). The folks on the phone are pleasant enough ..they would say, 'certainly, we can tailor your menu based on yr attendees' requirements', commit to sending you the menu within the day....and then nothing.  I have been chasing them for 2 weeks now, and even after explaining to them that I am going on vacation, nothing.  I regret changing our venue from CHOP to this place, as this is an indication of bad service.  I am looking for other venues now as I am scared this place will disappoint, if they cant even manage to send an email or call back!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for vacation this past weekend. We were looking to go check out the CN Tower and grab some dinner in the area. We stumbled across this place because the hostess was outside letting passersby have a glimpse of the menu and advertise their \"Summerlicious\" meal offering of an app, entree, and dessert for $25. 

I guess that was enough to lure me in...What a great deal! But I didn't end up getting that. Instead, I picked something off of the favorites menu- the prime rib, which comes with a side and a seasonal vegetable. I chose the garlic chive mashed potatoes, and the vegetables were broccoli and edamame. My boyfriend chose the NY strip steak and also got the same sides. And btw, both of these also came with salads. Great for around $30 a piece. Err..actually my prime rib was about $23. Wow! We never get prime rib this cheap in the states. And it was quite tasty at that. I was stuffed- not sure if it was because of all the meat or because I'd shoveled in 2 dinner rolls with that delicious honey butter before our meals came. Either way, my tummy was happy. 

To drink, I had the lime ginny. Refreshing and delicious! Glad we stopped to eat here instead of the other restaurants nearby, which were all just offering regular bar food. 

In summary, I liked it and enjoyed my experience there. Waitress was very nice and provided great service also. We were wanting to check out a bar serving local craft beer, and she kindly recommended the loose moose. Check out my review on their page! 

thanks, chophouse!"}
{"text":"What better way to spend a Thursday evening, but at Canyon Creek for a few drinks. The reason I had such a great experience was because of our server/bartender Chris. He was really great at his job. He does this weird but noticeable thing to all of his booth tables where he goes down on his knee to start the order. I guess it's kind of his trademark. He was very engaging and knowledgeable. Best of all he was a funny guy with a joker personality. He definitely has won my business. Chris had the best customer service I've seen in a while. 

Drinks are good everywhere you go, it was $6 Stellas, $6 Muskokas and $5 off appetizers on Wednesday and Thursday. I kept pounding back the Muskokas and we had the Canyon Dip which was pretty good. I might have to go back on a Wednesday or Thursday night. Overall one of the best nights I've had out in a while. I'd come back for sure. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"My go to place in Scarborough for a nicer dinner with the family or for special occasions. The steak doesn't ever disappoint and they tend to always cater to the customer. It was my sister's graduation and I was pleasantly surprised with a brownie cake with a sparkler to celebrate-FREE! 
Excellent wine selection.
I highly recommend the Prime Rib and the prime rib sliders as well. Calamari offers a great starter.
New York striploin is also a personal favourite."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was great , the service was good and the food was awesome and I tried the burger and it was great place for group party and I tried Asian nachos and it was spicy but amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Great service, elegant setting and tasty food. More like 4.5 star. Would like to see a little more variety in the menu and this would be a five star. 

Coffee crusted steak was delicious. Veggy burger with extra avocado was also very tasty. 

Nice wine selection and reasonable prices considering the setting, quality and service. Puts places like milestones to shame. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"I never chose to come to this place assuming it was a steak place. But we came for a family outing to celebrate 5 birthdays...we were a group of 16. The servers were polite and tried hard but by the end of the evening the service really slowed down and the table was not cleared adequately.
They were happy to split the bill however we wanted...by family of just divide by 4.
The table set up was long tables but it was fine...we just had to get up and walk to the people at the other end to talk to them.
The restaurant was very big and clean and the washrooms were ok.
Most people ordered steak, ribs or burgers. A couple of the steak dinners arrived cold and they happily replaced them. My meal was the harvest bowl minus the dairy based sauce. It was fine. They did have a veg burger on the menu but I avoided that as it had cheese in it."}
{"text":"Winter-undelicious: This was not a good Winterlicious pick.

Quick - I must write it down before I completely forget the unmemorable food of Canyon Creek.

I came for Winterlicious - which advertised a \"California Striploin Steak\" on their menu. I wanted Steak - and only steak and a steakhouse seemed to be the place to go. Boy, was I WRONG!  

I arrive and I'm told by a surly waitor:  \"The striploin is actually a roast - it comes either medium-rare to medium - somewhere in that range.\" What? At a steakhouse? Who expects to go to a Steakhouse and not be able to order their steak exactly how they like it ? Be it Blue, rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-well or well done. And since when do you call a ROAST a STEAK? They are two completely different cuts of meat.  It's unacceptable that a steakhouse would not have a regular steak, cooked to order, on their Winterlicious menu. Really wish I'd gone elsewhere instead. Big mistake coming here!

Ended up getting a very unmemorable burger instead because I was upset about the menu. It tasted home-made, which is nice, but there was nothing memorable or special about it. The shoestring fries were crispy (bonus), but way too salty and really reminded me of McDonald's fries. I tried the winterlicious \"roast\" that my friend ordered. Maybe it was 4 ounces of meat and 1.5 ounces of  pure fat - just a hunk of pink meat on a plate. It had none of that gorgeous searing you'd expect - nay - NEED - when ordering a steak. It was tender but had very little flavour. His potatoes were flavourful but became boring very quickly.

The only good thing was the Pot de Creme for dessert. 

I will not go back to this place. I'm upset at the way they mislead consumers to believe they'd be getting a real striploin steak when they were just getting old roast that had been sitting on a counter all day."}
{"text":"Attentive, friendly bartender, prime rib dinner was cooked perfectly. Music was relevant. I couldn't find the wifi access. Atmosphere was vibrant."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and the customer service is always great.  The food is good also but nothing that stands out from similar restaurants.

There was no wait at this location but then again we came at around 6:30PM on a Friday.  The server we had was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks, a plus."}
{"text":"En route by train from Vancouver to Quebec we spent two nights in Toronto,where we came across two restaurants close to the hotel. An Irish restaurant being closed on Sunday, and (I think) Canyon Creek next door. Being Saturday evening, the Irish was first on the list. However, Canyon Creek had an Entry that caught my eye and so nailed the next evenings dinner choice.

That entry was meatloaf. Not just an ordinary meatloaf, but one with a Cajun twist. Growing up in midwest USA, meatloaf had never been anything to write home about,,,, until I discovered Cajun. Paul Prudhomme. I  had become addicted! I had to experience this meatloaf from the land of it's origin. I was not to be disappointed! Unlike the traditional sliced serving, this meatloaf was mounded over garlic mashed potatoes, topped with a very spicy sauce & crowned with crispy fried onions. The side was probably something green. I do not recall. It did not matter. Never again will I serve boring sliced meatloaf."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 4pm on Blue Jay game day. Arrived and sat right away. Sat at a 6 top placed right by the kitchen in an empty restaurant. Jim our server came right away and got drinks on the go and was ready to take order. He was great and patient with the kids. Calamari and cesear salad came out quickly and meals followed 5-10 min later. I'd rather wait 5-10 min between app/meal then be rushed, thanks Jim! Meals were tasty and fresh and kids meals had fresh fries. Awesome. The guacamole on my chicken tacos was soaking through so after my first bite so they began to break apart. Maybe also offer flour tortilla but corn was okay. Dessert 5-10 minutes after meal, bought birthday dessert for my brother which was awesome they remembered. Would've been 5 stars if they didn't sit us by the kitchen in an empty restaurant and the two staff who had a 'personal inappropriate' conversation right beside our table right beside kitchen door. Hearing the kitchen door bang every time it shut had my nerves going but had a cesear beverage to calm my nerves lol. 
Ps. They should also have sea salt grinder and pepper grinders on the table as most steak houses do these days."}
{"text":"I don't know....I could take it or leave it. Not great for the price. In fact, there should have been more for the price. My main gripe is that I'm going to assume that they were understaffed. But on a Thursday night in the summer with the Jays at home?  Other restaurants in the area seemed to be doing well. Maybe it's the location below grade. It took a really long time to get the food and there were very few patrons after 9:15. Most of the food was warm, not hot. That made a difference. I guess the quality was okay but it was just a let down for the price. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"This is my third time at this location. Service was great. Meal came with complimentary bread with honey butter. I ordered the garlic shrimp ravioli. I guess the menu was unclear, because the way it was written, it seemed as if there would be shrimp inside the ravioli as filling, but I still enjoyed the dish nonetheless. As for prices, it is what is expected, not cheap but you get what you pay for, good quality food! The waitress came to check up on us multiple times, which was great. As for the atmosphere, I liked the oil lamp and dim lighting inside the restaurant, enough to make it look classy but not too dark either. The music was a good low hum in the background, not too loud. Will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Went here after the Toronto Pro Supershow and first impression was great. Service was great and the place was swanky.

The menu was great with great naming food. I was truly excited with their fried chicken sandwich! I guess I might have overhype the meal since I was craving chicken and something fried.

Anyways, it was not good at all. Future canyon creek goers, don't bother with this meal. You are better off with a TV dinner. The food was tasteless and small portion. The sides were tasty but needs to dish out more portion. Skinny fries nice touch!

The cost was average dinner meal around $15 bux. Was it worth it? Probably not, it would've been better going to a pho or dingy restaurant than to eat what I ate here. Due to poor cooking recipe, myself and my girlfriend would not recommend this restaurant or comeback ourselves!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect it to be this good! Great atmosphere, very chill, customer service very friendly! Great layout, everything spread out and not on top of each other. Food was better than expected. Recommend the ceased sale and chipotle steak."}
{"text":"Canyon Creek is like a friend that you've had since childhood....reliable, friendly, steadfast, comforting, someone that you know although you haven't seen them in a while it'll be as though you saw them yesterday when you finally do......etc
Visited on the night of Dec. 27th to celebrate a friends birthday. Once again, the food was amazing, service top notch, ambiance incredible, this place has it all.
Just 2 small hic-cups....
1) The birthday girls steak wasn't cooked as ordered.....it was overcooked and on the dry side. She didn't complain though as she ordered it well done (how anyone can do that to a steak is beyond me). Her parmesean French fries were incredible
2) My baked potato arrived with sour cream on it when I specifically ordered it without. It was replaced without question.

What they did right:
1) Bruce, our server was fantastic...warm, attentive and recommended dishes to us. He helped make the evening great.
2) My Chipotle steak was the melt in your mouth kind. It was beyond incredible. 
3) The recommended Pinot Noir was excellent...hints of fig and currants....great pairing for the meal
4) Price point for the type of meal/restaurant is correct....it's not overpriced.
5) As it was a friends birthday and we didn't have dessert (normally it's comped if you tell your server), the waiter comped one of our appetizers instead.
6) You don't feel rushed here.....timing of meals (appetizers to dinner) is perfect/

This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vaughan and it continues to impress us."}
{"text":"Went there couple of nights ago for dinner as I was craving steak and have never had a full meal at canyon creek. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and drinks. After 5 on wed and Thurs is $5 drinks and $5 off apps.  We sat in the lounge for the promotion. We had the Panora chicken app which was ok however the Chipotle sirloin and coffee crusted sirloin we had for dinner was so good!! I had the double chocolate brownie to finish and it's one of the best desserts I've tried at a chain restaurant in a long long time.  The service was good too definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good...but not as good as I'd hoped it would be.

Went with co-workers for dinner one night. The ambiance was very enjoyable and the waitress was pleasant.

The calamari appetizer was uninspired - there was no taste of calamari, just fried coating. However, I'd ordered the Coffee Crusted Steak and was hoping for redemption in red meat.

Unfortunately, it was not to be. While the steak was cooked to my liking, the coffee flavor I'd expected wasn't present and the meat was a little tougher than I'd expect from a steak house. Additionally, the sides were apparently nothing special as I can't even remember what they were and it's only been six days since I dined there.

In my opinion, Canyon Creek tries to punch above its weight. However, it's a swing and a miss -- I don't mind paying for good-quality food and would rather go out once a month to a nice place than once a week to something lesser. Canyon Creek didn't earn my accolades on this visit."}
{"text":"I had the \"Coffee Crusted Steak\" it's Angus Beef Top Sirloin dusted with coffee, rubbed with brown sugar, Chef's special. The taste was really different in a good way. I had the medium rare... it was tender and juicy.....Excellent!! Must go there again."}
{"text":"Really a great place to dine out.... nice ambiance, good service, great food!!

I had a Coffee Crusted Steak. Angus Beef top sirloin rubbed with brown sugar, cracked pepper and coffee, onion straws, seasonal vegetables and russet potato mash. Ordered for medium rare....  It was cooked to perfection!!  Tender, juicy and full of flavor. The vegetables were also steamed perfectly, with texture and taste fully remaining.

My wife had Pan Fried Salmon. She said it was good, may be not the best she had recently, but it was good."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Loved the pre fixed meal option.

My steak had to be sent back as it wasn't cooked properly but everything else was wonderful.

Had a happy hour (Half off) of drinks.

Nice ambiance and great waitress for the table of 6."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and this review is based on my last experience. This time I had the shrimp ravioli. My friend had the steak done medium well with onion rings, fries and salad. The ravioli was pretty good but not outstanding. I think it looked better than it tasted to be honest. My friend on the other hand really liked his entree. Service and atmosphere were fine, nothing above the ordinary. Overall, I was indifferent to the experience.. for me, it's one of those places I don't mind coming if someone suggests it but at the same time it won't be at the top of my list. Overall rating: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This was actually a better prepared steak than Chop across the steak. This is a nice place to seek comfort during a long week of business travel. Staff were friendly, and the food is simple and aimed to please. A comfortable home away."}
{"text":"Returned to Canyon Creek Front Street (again, with some co-workers - their choice!) and my rating stays the same.  The service was inattentive again.  It took quite a while to get drinks (the draft beer was flat by the time it made it to the table... you could see where the foam WAS).  The food took a while to arrive too.  We got 3 apps and dug into them pretty hungrily and then boom, our main courses were upon us.  Timing seems to be a bit of an issue here!  Food was pretty good though.  Again, we were 4 people in a booth and I had to keep my feet & legs crunched up to avoid kicking my friends (and I'm only 5 feet tall so I would hate to see someone taller try to be comfortable at these booths!)."}
{"text":"Bread and butter here is the main reason why I come. Wish they sold it on the side because it is seriously so good! 


Pros: 
- Service is great. I'm always attended to right away and they make sure you are comfortable. Anytime you are not sure what something is on the menu, they explain it to you very well 
- Bread and butter: their 7 grain bread and honey butter is SO GOOD! If you love butter like me then you will totally love this! The butter is made in house and it is so smooth. Goes really great with the 7 grain bread 
- Seating and parking: lots of seating which means you never have to wait and i can always find parking around. Great location. 


Foods I love to eat there: 
- Steak: steak is great and always tastes good. Regardless if it's the Filet Mignon, NY steak or the regular steak frites, it always tastes so fresh 


I have nothing bad to say about Canyon Creek. The people always make me feel comfortable and they are so attentive. The service is 10/10 for sure!"}
{"text":"Made reservations online using the \"OpenTable\" app,.. sweet app, first time user.

Myself, wife, and two kids. I'm always trying to find places that are kid friendly,.. this place is for sure.

Started with the Canyon Dip for an appetizer, it was wonderful.. For dinner I got the rib-eye, wife got the salmon, kids got burgers. Prices were reasonable for downtown Toronto.

All the food was delicious!!! Atmosphere was great,.. a lot of restaurants tend to get extremely loud when they get busy,.. this place seems to be designed well so that we're not screaming at each other across the table.

Cheers!!"}
{"text":"You gotta pay a little extra to have good food. Thats the best way to describe this place.

Meal starts with complementary bread.

Bacon cheese burger $15.85 - didn't get to try but my female guest finished it before I could finish my sandwich so that says alot about it. Meat juices rolling down the arm also gives me good reason to believe it was an awesome burger. 

Prime rib sandwich $18.95 - meat oh so soft and tender. Good portion of meat. Ajus dipping sauce was amazing. The wasabi sauce for the fries gave it that extra kick. Probably the best prime rib dip so far for me. Every bite I took you would hear me say \"mmmmm\" to show how pleased I was.

Molten lava cake $7.95 - inside the cake was really hot like the name suggested. Comes with a scoop of ice cream on a thin caramelized waffle is the best way I can describe it. Tasted awesome. 

Creme brule $7.45 - I think it was a Baileys flavoured. Nice hard sugary top layer. Didn't like how the were some kind of nuts at the bottom. 

Service was amazing. Prices a bit high but quality of food is also very good. 

4.5 for me"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but unfortunately I was so disappointed. 

On a Sunday evening, my family and I dined at Canyon Creek for my birthday dinner. A reservation was made through Open Table (made note it was for a birthday) and there was no issue. We were greeted and seated right away, at this time it wasn't very busy in the restaurant. Later on, more parties came into the restaurant.

We were greeted by our server Fran (I think that was her name). She was very friendly. After taking our orders including drinks, over 20-25 minutes passed but we did not receive our drinks yet. She came back and told us there was a delay at the bar - at this point she asked us if we would like any bread. About another 10-15 minutes after this, we received our starter salads and soup. Awhile later, our food finally arrived but this led to many issues arising.

I ordered the Prix Fixe Menu - Caesar Salad, Chipotle SIrloin (Medium Rare) and Creme Brûlée. 

My family members ordered the following:
* Top Sirloin (Medium Well) with a baked potato
* Starter Salad and Mushroom Truffle Soup
* King Burger with french fries
* Prime Rib Sandwich
Kids Burger with french fries

Top Sirloin was cooked incorrectly, it arrived as Medium and we spoke to our server; she took it back to the kitchen but when it came back, there was a piece of the sirloin missing (?) and the meat was cooked unevenly. We were so puzzled as to what happened - she said she would request to have a new steak made for my sister. At this time, I explained to her the issue with the Chipotle Sirloin which was overcooked to a Medium Well and tasted extremely dry. Not sure how the kitchen can serve Medium Well and think someone who ordered Medium Rare wouldn't notice. After this was corrected, it was cooked Medium Rare this time and I was given a thicker cut of meat. At time point, most of my family had finished their meals - as all these errors caused us to wait even longer. It was hard to enjoy my meal after the long wait and mishaps unfortunately. 

Overall - I would not come back here again. It was a huge disappointment. Normally when I notify a restaurant of a birthday, there is a complimentary dessert or even a mention of it. None of this was done - on top of this, the kitchen was inconsistent and extremely slow. Drinks took forever to arrive - even water took awhile. The manager did however take off the Top Sirloin and Prix Fixe off the bill but it does not incline me to want to come back again.

I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We went to CC tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday. As soon as we got there it was chaos. Hostesses were not very friendly and didn't greet us for several minutes. We were seated at the round tables near the back and it had terrible lighting. Half the table was lit from a single bulb above and the other half was completely dark. Water droplets were also dripping on our table from above. 

Service was also mediocre. Our server was 'nice' but didn't practice proper server etiquette. When our salads were done, he asked us to pass him our plates instead of moving around the table and doing it himself. When our salads and dinner came, he never came around to ask if we'd like fresh pepper or how our meal was. 

When it came time for my daughter's 'happy birthday' moment, he simply came by and put the cake in front of her and left.  How disappointing!!!! 

Anyway, it's all gone downhill and I won't go back. So sad, since it used to be one of my favourites."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Canyon Creek isn't that bad. I went today for a client meeting and they have changed there menu since the last time I was there 6 months ago. Their lunch menus seems to have expanded so that is a bonus but they have discontinued their wood plank salmon which was my go to. This time I went with the steak and lobster mash. I found the steak to have a little too much pepper, but the lobster mash was really good. They had the right amount of butter and big chunks of lobster in it."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night after 5pm, they have some great specials in the bar including prime rib sliders, coconut shrimp, and a few other food items coupled with Keith's IPA or Stella Artois - all items on special are $5 each. Not bad considering normal prices are fairly high. I had two apps and an IPA for under $20 with tip - not bad for the area."}
{"text":"Went to a Leafs game last night and Triple C took reservations. It was quite packed with people going to the game like us or stopping in for dinner as they waited to go home on the train.

Considering its location, the prices aren't too bad. They have daily deals as well. The 5 for $5 Wednesday deal is only applicable to the bar, which I learned upon ordering. The food was okay - it looks like everything comes in a package and is just microwaved.

I won't be opposed to coming back, but I also won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night.   The decor is nicely done, casual but elegant at the same time.    The bar area looked ample and well lit.    We sat in a booth and the menu looked delicious !    We decided to go for the Prix Fixe Menu:  Salad, Entree and dessert for less than $30.

My garden salad was fresh, good tasting and big.  

The salmon was tender, juicy, nicely marinated.   I asked for rice pilaf instead of potatoes and the rice was very good.

The Creme Brulee was OK, a little cold, even though it had been torched.

Good affordable choice near YYZ."}
{"text":"We were walking down Front Street after a Blue Jays game on July 19th and we stopped in. That was one of the best decisions we made on our trip to Toronto. Our server, Emma, was outstanding!  She was very nice, professional, and very helpful. The food was incredible. We loved the honey butter with the fresh bread. The steaks were some of the best we have ever had.  When we go back to Toronto we will definitely be going back to Canyon Creek!"}
{"text":"If people order what I had, I think these reviews will be much higher. I had a fantastic meal. Started with white sangria, then had lobster guacamole and fish tacos. The chips for the guac were freshly sliced tortillas that they fried. So delicious and fresh. They also had delicious fresh bread with honey butter."}
{"text":"Ordered the apple pecan salad while my son had the kids menu sliders.  

Was very disappointed by the dilapidated salad that featured only a small smattering of goat's cheese.  It was very sweet and considered a stand-alone plate.. but mostly featured bruised lettuce.

My son's meal?  Apple slices were cut very chunky... sliders, albeit good - didn't have tomato or onion or anything more than a piece of more lettuce. 

For a $20 apple & lettuce feed.. was pretty disappointed.  True ordering was a factor, but from a Steakhouse was expecting a more filling meal."}
{"text":"Decent food and nice service there. The steak is not bad thou the peppercorn sauce is a disappointment. I have also tried the calamari, it met my expectation. But the fancy presentation for the beef and mushroom stew was not my cup of tea, I would prefer they give me more puff pastry to go with the beef stew."}
{"text":"Usually go there 5-6 times a year.  Good wine selection and good steaks.  Superb bread and honey-whipped butter too!  Hubby lives their chophouse salad which comes with a house raspberry dressing.  A lil disappointed list week, xmas season,  when i went. Their steak was not done anything to Chicago style i ordered and described clearly to server about.  And they no longer serve my favorite pecan pie."}
{"text":"Lunch time at Canyon Creek. Was with a client for the meal. It was jammed but decent nonetheless. Had the Southern Chicken Sammy combo, included salad. I didn't read the menu close enough, it had Jalapeños in it & it caught me by surprise a little!! The serving staff was friendly, no complaints here."}
{"text":"So I stopped for lunch with colleagues after attending a trade event. This is a nice \"looking\" restaurant but I think that's where it ends for me. 

The service was very slow. Took us 30 minutes+ to get our food & it was straight off the lunch menu! The other thing was the general food quality of my meal. I found the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich dry & flavourless. It was also rather poor looking as well as evident by the attached pic. One more thing...lettuce was a tad brown on the edges which means it was either old or dried out, neither which is very appetizing! I'm over my Canyon Creek urge!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and quaint. Food was phenomenal, service was friendly. Had the prime rib sandwich which was tender and flavorful, the goat cheese and chicken pene which was moist and delicious, and they even do burgers well. Tried the blueberry smash cocktail which was fresh, fun, and refreshing. Nailed the extra spicy Caesar as well."}
{"text":"I've been to this Canyon Creek a couple times before but they never really amazed me. However, this time third time that I went, they were really good! The service was decent and the food was good. 

For starters, my sister got the Caesar salad and the waiter suggested splitting the Caesar  salad into two bowl so I can have some too which was very considerate of him. The Caesar tasted like a normal Caesar so there's not much to comment on that.

My dad got the chophouse which is a bed of tomatoes with sweet onions, blue cheese and topped with a raspberry vinaigrette. This was very refreshing and delicious and I recommend people getting this over the other two salads they offer.

For the entrees, I got the Wellington County Flat Iron (8 oz square cut steak served with Canyon Creek's fully loaded baked potato with Ravine mushroom sauce and served medium rare) which was part of their Local Harvest Menu. I usually only get filet mignon at restaurants because I know for sure it'll be soft. I was a bit worried that this steak was going to be tough but it was very soft and delicious. It was seasoned well and I have nothing to complain about it. The potato was very normal, it was topped with sour cream, some cheese and onion.

My sister got the slow-roast prime rib (aged 40 days, mustard crust and it came with horseradish cream). Again, I thought that the steak was going to be tough but it was surprisingly soft! This also came with a fully loaded baked potato.

My dad got the cedar plank salmon (8 oz butter-brushed Jail Island salmon filet with lemon white win and tomato broth). I remember trying this before and I did not like it at all. However, this time around, the fish was made perfectly. The fish wasn't over or undercooked so it was very moist and not dry at all.

My mom got the prime rib quesadilla (which is a starter but she's a small eater so it was a perfect entree for her). I've never had a quesdilla with prime rib as the protein. I think I still perfect chicken in my quesadilla but this was an interesting dish.

For dessert, we all got the pumpkin creme brulee (pumpkin from O'Neilland Farms and Ontario cream) from their Local Harvest Menu. I won't lie, the main reason we came to Canyon Creek is because I'm a big pumpkin lover and I really wanted to try this dessert. I was a bit disappointed with the creme brulee because the top didn't crack. However, the taste and smoothness made up for the disappointment so I'm still satisfied with the dessert. You can definitely taste the distinct pumpkin taste and it was a perfect ending to the meal.

Just a quick tip. If you sign up for their newsletter, you can get a $10 off any food coupon. This is a great deal for those interested in trying out this restaurant but is unsure about the price point."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on the prowl for a new restaurant when we realized our current dinner reservations were for a restaurant where steaks were ~$75+. Being that we haven't harvested our money tree just yet, we were looking for something tasty but more affordable.

I could kiss my husband a thousand times for finding Canyon Creek.

We walked in and were seated right away, and promptly greeted by a super enthusiastic and chipper waiter who's name I've unfortunately forgotten. Given that the husband and I are jovial folks, we hit it off with our waiter. It probably helped that he praised all of our selections and told us we wouldn't be disappointed.

He wasn't wrong. 

First, let's talk about the bread. It was a small loaf of whole grain wrapped up in a white cloth, and it was warm and soft with a chewy crust. And the butter? Sweet baby Jesus the butter. It was a honey butter, I think, but I don't care- all I know is I slathered it with reckless abandon upon my bread and devoured 2 pieces in record time.

Next, we ordered the Asian nachos for an appetizer. I thought the bread was good? PSHAW. The Asian nachos punched the bread and butter situation in the face. There were 6 long, rectangular wontons covered in chicken, some sweet but spicy sauce, vegetables, and cheese. Oh man. It took a lot of restraint for us not to polish off the plate, but I had my eye on dessert.

Our entrees arrived, and I got the clubhouse sandwich w/skinny fries, and the bearded half got the bacon cheddar burger. Both sandwiches had bacon and cheese on them, so naturally they were awesome. Being from the states, I really appreciated that the chicken on my sandwich was a reasonable portion and not a thick, huge piece like we'd have at home, which would force me to unhinge my jaw just to take a bite. I didn't love the fries, but that's not on the restaurant- they're crispy shoestring fries, and I love me some some mushy fries. 

Lastly... The crown jewel of our meals: dessert. I ordered the banana coconut cream pie (which is like my Peter Pan happy thought now), and my husband ordered the maple bacon butter tart. His was tasty, because bacon, and mine... Mine was like a banana made sweet love to a coconut and this pie was the result of that holiest of unions. It was all my dreams come true in a pie- the pie I never knew I was missing. It was light and fluffy and in a cute jar. I relished every bite and took my sweet time, growing sadder and sadder that our time was coming to a close... I destroyed it anyway. No regrets.

All that to say, we *loved* the restaurant, and next time we're in town, we'll absolutely be going. The waiter and food were awesome. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Service here has always been consistently great! One of my boyfriend and I's favorite restaurants. Food is also amazing. I definitely recommend the prime rib sliders and their butter and bread is super yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a worst experience for first time being Toronto, I took my son to have the dinner right there and he ordered steak and lobster as main entry... nightmare started at 2:00am in the morning, he got food poisoning, being bathroom many times until blood in the toilet! 
He will miss the first day of hockey tournament!
Bad food from bad kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great service and very yummy prime rib.  The place is downstairs in a cave like atmosphere. I love dark restaurants so it worked for me but could be a problem for those who like views of outside or more people watching. Very intimate feeling in your booth.  Great service when we were there."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 20x give or take in the last year, and this is by far the best place in the Square One area to eat a burger, steak, or just shareable apps with friends, family or a date. May be a good after work spot too for the more traditional career types.

Atmosphere: sophisticated and relaxed. Great for conversation and dates. Not hectic and loud (dare I say, obnoxious...) like those other chains even in the bar area. Bar area has 3 screens usually playing the game. But the screens are small so you would not be subject to having to tolerate the loud belligerent sports fan at the bar getting wasted next to you while your are trying to enjoy a nice meal.

----

Food: The food is great quality and value. Best burger in the square one area and it's only $14 or 15, I couldn't believe it.

Shareables:
-Prime rib sliders are delicious 
-Calamari is consistently great
(Both good value too)
** I wish bacon wrapped scallops were a shareable...!

Do not get:
X Lobster dip... Overpriced one nugget of lobster
X Asian nachos... Unless you like salty crisp wonton wrappers

Salad:
-Caesar on point

Steak:
-All the steaks I've had have been great, as you would expect though, as it is a chop house.

*Complimentary fresh bread served with a delicious honey butter.

Food Cons: I'd stay away from the chicken sandwich (not enough chicken to justify the price). Don't get the beef stew, dry beef and too small for the price.

---

Service: Bartenders/servers are kind, friendly, attentive and most importantly: seem to care about their job and making you the customer happy with your visit. I have never had a bad experience with service here. And after 20 visits in a year, that is saying a lot. If you sit in the bar lounge area you may get the singing bartender/server. She'll belt out a line or two every few minutes along with the songs, it's pretty entertaining. Luckily she's a good server too.

---

Best nights:
Wednesday and Thursday night promo.. $5 off shareables."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and my family has also been a couple of times
The first time was alright; i was there for the lobster feast and was happy because of the cheaper prices than The Keg
the second time was alright... the food seemed to be getting worse

The third time was AWFUL
after this I WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!
we were there for the lobster/seafood feast and everything was awful
me and 2 others all got the lobster pasta [i believe this is the name]
there was no lobster; maybe 2 small pieces, the mussels were closed (meaning they were DEAD!) and they were very slimy and gross
I love seafood and know this is NOT right
When we complained to the waiter HE LIED TO us, saying the mussels are \"cooked twice\" which could make them close; a mussel can only close up when it is ALIVE, making it impossible to \"close up after it is cooked\" he brought us another pasta that was just as bad
but did not want us to leave
he was LITERALLY BADGERING US TO GET appetizers and \"not leave hungry\" so we finally gave in
the crab cakes were BURNT on one side (the side that was covered) and the coconut shrimp were kind of slimy and had a bad consistency
we did not even want to complain just get the hell out of there
the waiter CHARGED US FOR THE APPS AND THE NEW PASTA!
it was awful
when i tried to complain to Sircorp, their headoffice, i got no response
I both called and emailed
I guess they do not care to provide a good experience and I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE
Go to the Keg instead! or Eddy's Steakhouse or Small Rooms! All are MUCH better steakhouses"}
{"text":"Food was amazing just like the pictures you see, the service was great, and food made fresh when ordered."}
{"text":"14 oz Rib Eye Steak ($40.95) - served with onion straws and loaded baked potato. Ribeye is my favourite cut and I'm going to give them a 2/5 for the steak I had last night. It was a little too rare.. legit was just \"beef tataki/sashimi\" with a seared edge lmao cause I pretty much just ate raw beef. I didn't ask them to sear it a little more because I was worried it'll come back medium or well-done so I just left it as it is. I didn't like the onion straws that came with it.. felt pretty extra and it looked like hay. The loaded baked potato was also whatever, nothing special, something I could've made at home. I was just a little disappointed, maybe I shouldn't be comparing this with The Keg but damn... the bone-in ribeye steak there is $40 for 20oz and it's done to absolute perfection, also comes with better potato side and roasted veggies. Canyon Creek please take notes!!!!!!! 

Mojito ($10.25) - it was meh, even The Cheesecake Factory serves better mojitos lol. 

$40 prie fix menu (smoked salmon on flatbread with capers, southwest chicken, and brownie with vanilla ice cream) - this seems \"worth it\" but it wasn't even good so.. everything was extremely dry and presentation was terrible. The flatbread was rock solid and tough to chew on, the chicken was dehydrated lol. The flavours were very basic as well. The brownie tasted like sponge cake, vanilla ice cream tasted like Chapman's.

Overall, the service is decent. The presentation and plating needs work. Flavouring could also be better. Food is bleh. Just feels like it's an average restaurant that's trying to be \"upscale/classy\" but it's nowhere close. This is definitely not a high end or special occasion restaurant, more for casual dinners.. but I wouldn't come again because I'd rather spend my money at another steakhouse since the prices are similar anyways, for much better quality."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday lunch for my sister's birthday.  There were 6 of us total.

The place is nice and classy.  Wooden tables, with waiters dressed in vest. 

Food: (4.5 stars)
For appetizers:
asian nachos (kind of spicey, but really delicious)  comes in 5 (4 stars)
calamri (5 stars)

For main meals, we all got steaks.
I got Rib Eye with fully loaded potatoes on the side. (4.5 stars).  It was really good but nothing really amazing)

The whole bill came out to 360.

Service: (4.5 stars)
The waiter was very polite, gave us suggestions on what are the favorites, came to check up on us a few times, but was not annoying.  
He was a bit slow on refilling water so (.5 star) off.


Overall very similar to the KEG.  

Would go there again."}
{"text":"Arrived around 530, sat at the bar for Happy hour wine and possible snacks or dinner. All wines were offered at 5oz price for 8oz pour... a great deal! CC offered some amazing 3 course meals.  Currently avoiding carbs... the 10 oz Prime rib was my choice and it was amazing, perfectly cooked as were the seasonal veggies. Definitely a good choice for the meat lovers!"}
{"text":"I had a late lunch today at Canyon Creek.   I sat in a booth on the dining room side

My server, Anthony, started me off with some warm bread.  Yum!

It's been about 15 years since I've been to this Canyon Creek and I remember they had a very delicious pork chop that I ordered whenever I was there.  It wasn't on the menu so I ordered a Southern Chicken Sandwich (minus the cole slaw and jalapenos) and fries.  The chicken looked huge!  Alas, it was all air, grease and batter with a very thin piece of chicken.

The bun was soft, which I liked.  I was disappointed with the chicken sandwich, though, given the lack of chicken.  In some bites, there was no chicken ... just batter :(  I expected more from Canyon Creek

I won't be rushing back or ordering this again."}
{"text":"My pal, Leanne, is in town from Vancouver and we got together this evening for supper at Canyon Creek..

Kacy, our server started us off with warm bread ... yum!

Leanne ordered Baja Fish Tacos and fries.

I ordered Smoky Bacon Burger (minus the cheese, lettuce and onions) and mashed potatoes.  The burger was really good.  I've had it before there and I'd get it again.

Leanne wanted to finish off with something sweet so had crème brûlée.

Kacy was really friendly and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"My friend I came here on a Friday night and found that it was not exceptionally busy. Still we got seated at a booth closest to the kitchen.  The menu selection was quite varied.  I opted for the salmon from the prix fixed menu which for $34 you get a choice of soup or salad, entree and Creme brûlée or brownie for dessert.  My friend went for the prime rib.  My salmon was nicely done, but I felt the portion was too small for the price.  My friend's prime rib was a little more rare than medium as requested.  The service was ok if not a tad indifferent. If in the airport area again, I think I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The experience I had here wasn't top notch...I'm sure that could be confusing for those currently looking at my rating. 

The food was amazing and so was the service by our waitress. The biggest issue was that we were there for 2 hours and my order for Pecan Pie was missed entirely (a MUST order! It's Effing enormous!). 

We alerted the management staff and they covered our drinks and dessert for the meal. They really did take care of us from that point onward. Their extra service has ensured my continued patronage to their location and their brand. They know how to take care of their clients and I know how to take care of establishments that care about their clients.

Love this place. It's great for a guy's night out."}
{"text":"Decent. 
I didnt feel like cooking and wanted to celebrate something, so took myself out to Canyon Creek on the other side of Sherway.
 
Nothing to really write home about, it's a pretty standard Canyon Creek. 
(It is not to put the chain down, i have been to a few and have always left full and happy...)
it does have a nice patio with tv's though.

The bread comes with this maple butter sorta stuff, sooooo goooood.
the steak was pretty standard, but cooked well."}
{"text":"Went to the Canyon Creek restaurant on Front St for dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated, but the dining area is very dark. It was difficult to see the menus.

We both took the $37 prix fixe menu. I ordered the prime rib with creme brulee. My friend ordered the chiptole sirloin with the chocolate brownie. We both had the leak and bacon seasonal soup.

The soup was was very good and I enjoyed it. The prime rib was tender and tasty. My friend liked her chiptole sirloin steak. We both like our deserts.

The service was excellent. Everybody was very friendly and helpful

I been to Canyon Creek several times. For a chain restaurant, the food is pretty good and service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. I've tried the steak when other people have it, but I'm a huge fan of burgers and they are fantastic here. Soo juicy. I don't like the fries, they're the thin kind. Not a huge fan but they're good if you like that kind! A little bit pricy, so I don't go here often, but if it's a special occasion it's great!"}
{"text":"Haven't been for awhile because I have cut back on red meat.Yet I craved their prime rib sandwich,with a caesar today for a late lunch.Was really pleased with the lunch,it was fresh.Just wished they gave me more of the au jus sauce for dipping,forgot to ask.Server who helped me with my order in the bar was really pleasant."}
{"text":"We returned here for this first time since Canyon Creek opened back when it was called a chop house. The menu seemed a more interesting one than I remembered and our sampling of the lettuce wraps (3.5 stars) classic hamburger (2.5stars) and tilapia (4 stars) confirmed it.

Our only complaint is that oddly there is still a layer of smoke at ceiling level from the open fireplace, after all these years they've still not found a way to deal with the issue?

The best part of the evening was running into old next door neighbours who spied me from across the room as I entered to meet my already seated in a secluded booth wife. They joked with us that they approached very cautiously just in case I was meeting someone else;)"}
{"text":"The food is great. No matter what I've had its delicious. I love how spacious this restaurant is and it just feels cozy."}
{"text":"Just another chain restaurant experience. Don't expect more than that. Food is mediocre, liquor selection is poor, wine selection is decent. Service is young."}
{"text":"No complaints. Far exceeded expectations. Server was extremely friendly and attentive. Steak was nicely cooked to our preference."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to have to give this place 1 star. This is solely based on terrible atmosphere and horrible food. The server was so nice and lovely. But I simply cannot give this place a higher rating.
The great came out to us, and it was frozen in the middle. They explained to us that their bread comes frozen and they heat  it up. This is quite disturbing for a nice restaurant. The potato soup tasted like soap or windex, I couldn't tell which one. Maybe both. The atmosphere was so vanilla, so boring and sleepy. The wine list is unimpressive. They charge 9.00 for a wine that's 2.00 a bottle. I can't believe they even have such terrible wine on their menu. I would pay 25.00 a glass for a top shelf wine. They didn't offer a single top shelf wine by the glass. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love canyon creek food. Pretty chic dishes at reasonable prices. 

This location doesn't get too busy often so it's great because I've never had to wait to be seated. I enjoy going here for work events and birthdays, this location actually has boardrooms that are available for rent out and you're able to get fixed menus.

The bar is huge at this location, pretty big for a steakhouse, always a bonus if you are just looking to watch a game and sit by the bar. 

Now for the food, I absolutely love their truffle fries, so delicious and savoury.  Their steaks are pretty flavourful as well, nice cuts and good portions for the price. 

I strongly recommend the chicken penne, with a rich creamy tomatoes based sauce with goat cheese, it is definitely a favourite of mine and I get it all the time. I legit crave for the chicken penne, writing about it now is make my mouth water!

Overall if you haven't tried canyon before you gotta go, it's a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed at first to see the menu had changed up and the fish tacos removed. Then I ordered the Chipotle sirloin and was happily surprised! My dish was superb! This will be my preferred choice of meal when dining in at Canyon Creek :)"}
{"text":"If you have to dine in the west end chains like Canyon Creek are a dime a dozen.  The food and atmosphere were good, but the service was frightful. I couldn't believe how surly the waitstaff were... Forgetting to bring things as basic as water to the table.  My advice, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with friends. A bit tricky to get a reso at the time we wanted, which was weird because when we showed up there were a ton of empty tables. 
We had a great spot by the big fireplace so it was nice and cozy. The service was fairly quick, although when our server did disappear, she took a while to return. 
I like that their menu has a little \"gf\" beside all of the gluten free items. I still specified that it was not a preference but a necessity, but that's my own paranoia about being glutened coming through. 
I ordered the chicken tacos on corn tortillas with a salad. The salad was pretty typical of any restaurant chain. The tacos were great but need to be eaten quickly as corn tortillas do not hold up as well as flour ones and the insides started busting through the bottoms soon after I started eating (I made the mistake of having the salad first). The tacos were very flavourful and spicy - great combination of tastes. I really enjoyed them. They were absolutely loaded with purple cabbage (my fave!) so be aware of that if you're not down with cabbage. 
I'll be back to try more of their gfree offerings!"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse franchise that I've tried thus far.  I'm a big fan of steak, and this place has the most flavourful prime rib that I've tried outside of Alberta.  Reasonable prices and typical ambience.  Downside = no ribeye on the menu."}
{"text":"I must say the quality of the food use to be much better and I really enjoyed coming here. Not sure if the cooking staff has changed but have had one really bad and two mediocre meals in a row. Unfortunately, I think I am done going here. The atmosphere is nice and the staff are friendly but the food quality does not match the price. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick dinner before I caught a train at Union. Service was great and super friendly. Ordered the Steak Frites and it came quickly and looked great. But man was it overcooked (I had asked for medium rare) and chewy. Nice little place but 24$ for a steak of that quality ain't good enough."}
{"text":"I loved Canyon Creek, though my regular location is the Front street one. When at Canyon Creek I always like to order the Canyon Creek artichoke dip (amazing!), sweet potato fries, their bread and every once in a while a steak with mashed potatoes. I had never been disappointed with their food until today. 

Today for lunch I had planned to order my usual but could not find the dip in the menu. So I panicked. Where the hell is it? Please don't tell me that it has been removed! I called the waiter whose name was Addison over and asked about the disappearance of my favorite dip. He then explained to me that they have substituted my dip with one that was more \"appropriate for the Fall.\" What?! Then he went on to explain that the artichoke dip had been on their menu for such a long time that they thought it was time for a change. Mmm \"isn't the fact that it's been on the menu for a ling time a good thing. That it would imply that people enjoy this menu item?\" The logic behind the change was ridiculous to me. But I went ahead and ordered the imposter anyway. 

Shock #1, the portion was small! #2, there were no tortilla chips, but thin toasted bread in its place, 3) it had weird toppings on it and it looked more like hummus than the creamy dip that I was expecting. But I wanted to give it a fair chance, so I dug into it. I gave it 3 bites and then put it aside. I could have cried. What the hell was this?! I sat there feeling miserable and began munching on my \"too salty\" sweet potato fries (odd since I like my food salty anyway...way too heavy handed on the seasoning)  thanking the potato Gods for allowing me at least this reprieve. My friend noticed how miserable I looked, and okay, I was probably whining, so when Addison came by to check in on us, my friend told him about my disappointment. Addison was very apologetic and offered to get me something else. So I browsed through the menu and decided to get a Caesar salad.  Not because I wanted a salad, but because it looked like the safest option on the menu. A couple of minutes later the manager came over to inquire about my concerns. She also was very apologetic and asked if it would be okay for me at the end of our meal to fill out a survey where I could detail my experience. I agreed to do so wholeheartedly. 

In sum:

Negatives:

Salad too salty. I did not finish it. 
Sweet potato fries too salty. Did not finish them.
Butter did not have enough honey.
Dip had too many competing ingredients, none of which I found appealing.

The good:

Service was excellent.
Coke was good and they have free refills, though after the second refill my empty glass was ignored.
I got a free dessert coupon at the end of my meal (to be used with the purchase of a main only)

If they do not bring my dip back, I will have no reason or motivation to return to Canyon Creek. So sad."}
{"text":"This chain has really gone downhill! I checked out their Winterlicious 2015 dinner menu last night with 11 friends, and it was mostly misses. 

Issues...

FOOD

SINGAPORE CRUNCH SALAD (made with grape tomatoes, cucumber, puffed quinoa and brown rice, radish, coriander, red onion, chickpea crisps, sesame seeds, with Thai dressing) - the one person that ordered it took two bites and would not consider taking a third. His exact words were, \"what the hell is this?! Disgusting! I can't eat this!\" And this person is not a picky eater. It did look interesting though. 

ROAST CALIFORNIA STRIPLOIN (garlic marinated striploin, chili roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli, with horseradish carrot puree) - was chewy, fatty and bland. This is the first time I wanted ketchup for my potatoes, salt for my broccoli, and a gravy for the meat. It was such a disappointing dish. Canyon Creek used to be so talented at cooking meat. Such a waste. 

STRAWBERRY RHUBARB CRUMBLE (freshly baked fruit, oat and brown sugar streusel, with vanilla bean ice cream) - 7 people ordered it, and only one person finished it - the one that finished said she did so because she loves jams and super-sweet desserts. :/ 

DRINKS

Sangria - it was wine, water and ice. No fruit, and very bland. Worst sangria we have ever had. EVER!

SERVICE

Service was very average. There were several complaints about the food from our group, and our server showed his annoyance and frustration. Trust me buddy, I was plenty embarrassed for having chosen this restaurant for dinner!

Also, although there were 4 people bringing the food out, they still managed to forget my main, and remembered it 10 minutes after everyone else got theirs. 

The few positives....

The butter is still delicious

The chocolate dessert was creamy, chocolaty, with a good chili kick. 

Overall....

Never going back. I should have known that this chain was going downhill the minute they removed the Canyon Creek Dip from the menu and replaced it with the new version with caramelized onions.

**If you are obligated for one reason or another to visit Canyon Creek for Winterlicious, I suggest that you get the chicken or shrimp main, the soup or kale salad as the appetizer, and the chocolate option for dessert."}
{"text":"Service was good. I ordered the Baja fish tacos with Caesar salad for my side. The fish tacos were yummy but the Caesar salad dressing was too fishy. I remember their Caesar salad was garlicky and I loved it that way. I was disappointed with this. The ribs were yummy and fries. I had Estrella beer which was on special. It was too bitter for my liking. I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Thank you for a terrific dinner experience! Everything was delicious.  For starters, we had the Canyon Dip - and it did not disappoint.  For the main course we ordered steak and lobster mash.  The steak was juicy and done to perfection!  The mash potatoes were layered with bits of lobster meat and were completely decadent! Two thumbs up to Canyon Creek, Scarborough location."}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions. I usually order the burger as it's one of the best around (when comparing to other fine dining options) I recall the steaks are also quite good but I haven't ordered one here in a while. The service is consistently good. The patio is quiet. The bar is decent. Management seems good. I would recommend this place if you're looking for an easy (not very high-end) fine dining option like the Keg. And like any franchise restaurant, they are not always perfect and have their off-days, so I give them a 4."}
{"text":"I ordered Peppercorn Steak. I got steamed veggies and mashed potatoes as sides. The food was okay. Everything was a little too salty for my taste. I've definitely had better steaks elsewhere even Casey's steak was better than this, and I thought Canyon Creek's specialty was their steaks? Based on their chophouse labels? The steak was cooked right to medium rare but their meat was chewy and it tasted like ones you can get from Costco and cook them yourself. No offence to Costco meats, friends.

The service was friendly and the waitress was attentive. The atmosphere is warm and intimate, and there are plenty of parking spaces. This would be an awesome place for date nights and business dinners but I wouldn't come back here for the steak."}
{"text":"Not sure if I look like a lecherous old man or a cheapskate but I was seated in the section taken care of by the only male server in the building!  The restaurant was loaded with attractive female servers, not to say my guy didn't take care of my dining experience, but the scenery could have been nicer!  Starting with the salad of which the Honey/Lime dressing was delicious!  My server brought out a hot loaf of crusty on the outside soft inside bread with butter.  Then hardly had I finished with my salad my entrée came which was a Bone In Pork chop topped with home made stuffing and honey mustard sauce.  The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but the chop was fabulous.  Service good, food delicious, choices many!  Good dining with price about what you'd expect from a place that looks like this."}
{"text":"Visited for the 2nd time last night, another amazing experience!

First time I came here, I ordered the prime rib sliders, A-MA-ZING! small, juicy, delicious.  Small but filling!

Last night we ordered prime rib, rare, but because we went late, there wasn't much choice left so we were stuck with medium rare, but it still tasted deelicious!
Juicy and cooked WELL!

Lobster Guacamole, also greatly prepared.  Went to Mexico for the first time last year and ive loved guacamole ever since, this was impressive!  Dip was awesome.

Kids meal, 6oz prime rib, well worth the price for $9.99!

Service was superb, complimentary 7 grain bread was delicious, one of a kind, butter was also well whipped.

Can't wait to come back for their Wednesday evening specials!"}
{"text":"Went here for a new years dinner. Lucky we made a reservation as soon as we got home as it was packed and as soon as we got in, there was a large line of not so lucky people. We got escorted right in exactly on our reservation time. 

Our server was insanely friendly even though she was busy as a bee. Very helpful. She suggested the mashed potatoes over the fries and I commended her on her suggestion. She made an otherwise great meal fantastic. 

As for the food itself, it was amazing. We has the coconut shrimp and burgers and they were made to perfection. The buns were lightly toasted, the onions were cooked to the perfect level. Everything was done with care. I don't like horseradish so the coconut sauce was not for me but that is purely a personal preference. 

I would highly recommend coming here for any occasion."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was good, seafood linguine had a nice flavor. Only major complaint is had 1 scallop and 2 shrimp. 6 muscles was good. For this level of restaurant I expected a little more."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here because i was indulging myself by staying a night at the Royal York and my original plan was to dine at their gastropub, Piper's, both because they serve regional ales and regional foods.  But Piper's isn't open on Sundays. Rats.

I read the Yelp reviews for both Canyon Creek and the nearby Keg Steakhouse and decided to go to Canyon Creek.  I can't compare them completely until I try the Keg but based on the menus, while both are chains, Keg seems a bit more traditional.  Canyon Creek offers some dishes featuring regional ingredients and that's something that attracted me.

The Okanagan Pale Ale was great as were the local roasted mushrooms stuffed with spinach and goat cheese.  The garden salad was fresh and the tomatoes were real - not the tasteless things you get from many places most months of the year.  I went for the chipotle and roasted garlic coated sirloin, medium rare.  It was properly prepared and very tasty.  Fans of chipotle chiles will probably debate endlessly whether they overdid the coating or didn't do enough but i thought it was just fine.  The baked potato was, well, a good baked potato.  The pumpkin cheesecake dessert was delicious.  All in all, a very good meal.

I still want to try Piper's and the Keg. but i'd go back here again.  Is it a chain? Yes.  Was it a \"good\" steak rather than a \"great\" steak? Yes, but consider my definition of a \"great\" steak.  When I treat myself to a steak dinner I go to a store with a real butcher section and spend $20 -25 a pound ($10 - $15 a kilo) on a dry-aged porterhouse or other high-end, tenderloin-based cut of meat.  Chains don't serve those because their clientele isn't interested in $40-50 entrees, but $15-25 ones.

Chains can be popular because what they do is usually reliable and replicated at their branches.  I liked what Canyon Creek has to offer as a standard.

Oh, yes. The server was polite, charming and personable.  The atmosphere was pretty laid back, but then I wasn't there during a rush period."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Canadian chain restaurants and it just so happens they make the best bruschetta out there. From burgers to wings to sandwiches, they have never disappointed me. Best part is that they always have the game on too! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"You know what I love about Canyon Creek, the consistency. I don't come here often but every time I do I receive good service and good food. We decided to go to Scaddabouch on a Saturday night but the wait times were an hour +. My stomach was not prepared to wait that long so we walked over to Canyon creek. Surprisingly it was on only a 30 minute wait.  We sat at the bar and  ordered drinks as we waited.  3 cocktails later we were seated. I had a medium well steak, lobster mashed potatoes and seasonal crème brulée (with grand Marnier and cranberries). Everything hit the spot. Steak cooked perfectly with a slight trace of pink, fluffy mashed potatoes with butter poached lobster and creamy crème brulée with a hard sugary crust. The cranberries were a nice surprise at the bottom. Canyon creek has a very grown and relaxed ambiance with dim lighting and engaged servers. If you haven't been try it out!"}
{"text":"Great bar area and the food is top notch. My favorite go to places when in town on business."}
{"text":"We went on a night which had a chef's menu special which happens 3-4 times a year by invite only to its members which features a 3 course meal for $49 per person. Like all franchised restaurants, this Canyon Creek is considered a high-end franchise  which can found near popular dining spots like Jack Astor's, Batton Rouge, Scadabush, Boston Pizza, etc...Easily our favorite resto near Scarborough Town Center Mall. Lots of parking and easy access near the highways. The menus program included appetisers included sweet salad with had cranberries, red onions, apple cashews and salmon on flat bread with capers. We both got the surf and turf of lobster tail and a 6oz sirloin. This was capped with creame brulé with pumpkin glaze toping. Of course, my partner in crime wanted her red vino drink but she instead choose a Bloody Cesar which was on special. The good: great chef's menu best bang for your buck. The bad: it was a full house as a result. The waiters- waitresses didn't seem to have time to really explain the menu to you. The Ugly: due to a technical glitch, our booking was overlooked and we ended up waiting 20 minutes until we mentioned it. They did apologized and their manager gave us an extra appetiser for free. Wow...you don't get this often. We got a lobster- guacamole nacho plate. Tip: become a member worth it during Valentine's and Christmas chef's menu. Book in advance as these go pretty fast. You can see why Canyon Creeks are popular main stays. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my Boyfriend.  He had to get back to work so we asked the waitress if it was possible for to get the order made quick for a fast lunch. She avoided the question and told us there was 12 orders ahead of us and we need to wait because she has no idea when the food will be done.  I don't see why it was an issue for her to go to the kitchen and advise the chefs to prioritize our order.  She was being rude and short with us which we didn't appreciate.  We both ordered the southern chicken sandwich. Mine with shoe string fries and my boyfriend with garden salad. The food itself was excellent. The bread was soft and the chicken was crispy and tasty.  The show string fries was just the way I like it. Food was excellent however I took out 2 stars for the service.  Service is a make or break for my overall experience.  Our waitress was rude and gave us attitude."}
{"text":"Our monthly working lunch in good o'Scarborough. It's super convenient across from Scarborough Town Centre and work!

I opt out from the lunch menu and got a main. Pan sheared Salmon.  There was another option on the lunch menu where the pretty much the same salmon with salad but I figured I was hungry and maybe the main would be bigger.

But ... Too bad, it wasn't the case. Mine came with a few veggies. I should've gotten the lunch menu special :(. Salmon was cooked just right. Skin was crispy.

Highlight of the visit: quick service

Food (Taste): 3/5
Food (Presentation): 2/5 plate was dirty :(
Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 3/5 quiet enough to talk shop 
Fun Factor: 3/5"}
{"text":"Overall great experience. The food was great. The service could have been faster. In her defense she was holding down the bar and about 5 tables. 

The sirloin was perfectly cooked and was delicious with absolutely no fat. The house salad was fantastic with a house dressing (very light). The sautéed mushrooms were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"The Keg's arch nemesis!!
Price and quality almost comparable, but service lacks a little. 
I love their chipotle sirloin (without the goat cheese butter). Their New York steak is not so great. Caesar Salad had a lot of garlic, and you still taste it after you eat the steak. The ambiance is great there. Cappuccino also good. sweet potato fries was really good. Shrimp cocktail comes with giant shrimps but tastes funky.  House dip (mostly spinach) is pretty good, though I would have preferred it come with pita rather than nachos. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I really do like Canyon Creeks ... the one out by Pearson airport is great for business lunches or after work drinks ... this downtown steak-house just didn't put me over the top.  It was good - don't get me wrong.  But the thoroughbred Canadian standard is simply The Keg.  Canyon Creek just didn't quite measure up in the steakhouse department, although the rest of their menu was quite good (the asian beef salad is excellent).  It could've been the fact that their wine menu was missing the vintage years, or the menu just didn't step up high enough.

I'd say - if you have a date or a group, and you're organizing it - and jonesin' for a steak ... but the date and/or group need some variety of menu ... then this fits the bill.  If you just want a nice steak dinner -- shoot over to the keg, or hit the ATM on the way over to harbour 60."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite steakhouse in Missisauga. If you want to celebrate an occasion or simply fancy good steak, this restaurant is it! 

I ordered the chipotle sirloin which was cooked to perfection and the customer service was impeccable. Definitely coming back Jerez"}
{"text":"Walked in to this cool cave like tunnel entrance to be warmly greeted and taken to a table right away.

We had a long flight from Vancouver and just wanted food, this was close to our hotel we were at. The waiter came asked where we flew in from when over hearing convo with the hostess. He was very pleasant and welcoming.

We ordered a starter of the Asian nachos, and before that came he brought our drinks and this warm bread, and the butter was godly. So simple but I think it was whipped with honey, it was so gooood so pleasing haha!

Anyway Asian Nachos ROCK! Get them! Super tasty. 

The potato soup was really good I tried a little bit of it.

My clubhouse was solid nothing spectacular but it was tasty and prices here are super fair. 

The service was exceptional out waiter was a BRO! Haha definitely check this place out if your in town. Service here really makes it awesome, good prices, solid food."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse. I started with the Asian nachos. The ingredients didn't seem it would go together but to my surprise, it did; and it tasted fabulous. I had the steak frites as my entree and it was delicious as well. The food just needs work on the presentation. The presentation was mediocre. It made no sense to me why to bury the steak into the frites and onion rings. Besides that, I had an overall great experience tonight. Big thanks to Tyrone for serving us tonight!"}
{"text":"I was there with a friend on June 29.  We had made reservations and the 'check in' was smooth.
I found the location a bit dungeon-like, lol, but it was comfortable. It was before a Jay's game, so it was busy, bit loud however, we were comfy in a booth near the back.
The waiter (wish I could recall his name) was great. Service 5/5. He checked on us in a timely manner without being intrusive.
Food:
We both had the prime rib. My friend had it medium, I asked for as rare as poss. (default is med-rare). For sides, I had the chef salad. For 'house' salad, it was very good - it comes with only one dressing but I'd recommend. My friend had seasonal veg. as the side, and they were very good as well.
Prime rib was tender as it should be. No complaints at all.
... I know people go on about the bread - it's ok. I don't see the big deal about it, but yes, it's good, but I don't think it's all that 'artisan'. 
I had calamari as a start - it was good as well. I'd order it again. I'm pretty sure it's prepared to order and not pre-crumbed, frozen. (The calamari is likely frozen, but at least it tasted like it was freshly made).
Was  it mind-blowing? Not really.  But the quality of food was good at what I consider reasonable for what you're getting. I'd certainly return, since the service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Been to this location countless times. Probably the best from all the mid-higher end chains. Must try - Filet Mignon, Prime Rib etc. they generally have the best cuts. Great atmosphere and food. Service is a hit or miss

Specials of the week - http://canyoncreekrestaurant.ca/specials/

Received an invite to their Craft Beer Festival last week. Held at the enclosed patio area of the restaurant, got to sample three craft beers and one cider. Provided comp. appetizers which was a really nice touch and very generous. Their appreciation for their customers, makes me love them even more!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have combined my two visits into one review because the first visit was a total disaster. I won't go into details but service (new waitress not enough training), manager (told us we had to pay $5 extra for the waitresses mistake) and food (poor value, overcooked) were all lacking. We got an invite back from the GM to give it another try and service was better but bread for the table still came out after all the food and most of the food ranged from ok to tasty, chicken tacos were soggy. Burger was good the first time and good the second time but overall the value for what you are getting is simply not there. Toronto has so many great food options, I would not waste money here."}
{"text":"I had to come here again, only difference is location!  Those damn fish tacos.. I tell ya.. They are just so good, they better not stop making them. I'm serious. I got a burger, the original burger with bacon.. it was okay.. funny thing is I was going to get the peppercorn steak with lobster mash and I just changed my mind, all of a sudden and switched the order to the burger.. Something told me, I shouldn't have done that and should of just stuck with the steak dinner, but meh. I had the brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, it wasn't as good as the Vaughan location but still good. The waiter was okay, what's up with hiring fake, pretentious humans at restaurants? If only I had a restaurant, just to know who to hire, I'd show them how it's done.. Ah well, still good, the only reason why I keep going back is because this and Milestones and The Keg are one of the top 3 Chain restaurants I genuinely enjoy. The End smile face"}
{"text":"The waitress was sort of pretentious, but who cares because the food was great! Honestly, the fish tacos were fantastic and I can eat a pound of them, no joke.. Yes, that's how good it was. The pepper corn steak and lobster mash potatoes were really good, but I honestly am giving this restaurant 5 stars simply because of the fish tacos, no joke. I want them right now as I am typing this. I had a bubbly champagne drink, can't recall the name but it tasted really good. I also had the chocolate fudge brownie with vanilla ice cream and oh my goodness, it was Amazing. Oh and by the way, I always usually like Cannon Creek, but I safely have to say, that this was the best experience. The End."}
{"text":"So I came here.. Agaaaain. Yesterday evening for dinner with a friend. Oh my goodness.. me and those fish tacos eh? Yip.. I did it again. I had the prime rib fettuccine (basically fettuccine with beef, broccoli and mushrooms, in a nice creamy sauce). I liked it but I wouldn't order it again and the beef tasted really gross to me, I was disappointed in the taste but my moquito and Baja Fish Tacos made up for everything, because that is what I mainly went there for. The customer service was amazing, she was very attentive and genuine. I have been coming to canyon creek for years. I'll keep returning to canyon creek for as long is the restaurant is open, mainly for the consistency of great food. Not bad for a franchise. I'm impressed. I left full and happy. End."}
{"text":"Great ambience and food. There's a patio (overlooking planes landing at Pearson), bar, booths and private/party rooms. They have a few specials / must try's. The Asian Nachos are one of them and they are really good; a unique touch to a bar food staple. It gets very crowded even on weeknights owing to the proximity to a number of hotels and the convention center. Reservation is recommended. If not, expect a 20 minute wait for dinner."}
{"text":"Meh... Just meh.... Not awful, but pretty boring and not great.  Mash potatoes are half real half fake, steak was full if sinew... A rare steak should never be that tough to cut.... It tastes good but chewy and definitely not the beat cuts.
Staff is nice."}
{"text":"Well where do I start. I work at canyon so maybe I'm not the best person to write review. I've been off work for a few weeks now due to surgery. I can't tell you how much I miss the food there. Needles to say in that time off I did a lot of take out. And I mean a lot. I also visited some of my fav places in the city and some I found on yelp. Trust me when I tell you canyon airport has the friendliest staff ever. All the canyons do. I can't wait to get back to work. I miss the staff I work with they become family. Everyone there has a heart of gold. I miss our 7 grain bread and warm honey butter. Our home made ceaser salad dressing is a1. Prime rib to die for. The brownie. Please don't get me started. The best I've ever had. I never realized how lucky I am to work with a team of ppl that we can truly stand behind our food."}
{"text":"Decided to go with the Smokey Bacon Burger which did not disappoint, it was delicious. But, my fries were literally cold and not fresh. If it wasn't for the excellent service I don't think I would come back, so good job to the waiters."}
{"text":"Their bread and butter is sweet and yummy.  Also ordered lobster guacamole and coconut shrimp and they are fantastic. I was too full to finish the smoked bacon burger but I would have finished it all if I had more appetite."}
{"text":"The molten chocolate cake is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE.   SERIOUSLY.   Melting,  oozing chocolate... Yum yum!  Have it,  come on..... you know that you wanna!"}
{"text":"Great beef place!  It is way better than the keg!  I often have the large Prime rib... Take some home for another night! 

I love the appetizers too.   Although I'm sad that they got rid of the goat cheese salad, with the tomatoes..... It was awesome. 

Awesome desserts too.  Molten chocolate cake is spectacular!   I DO wish they'd bring back the bread pudding, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"$25 including tip on this travesty of a salad from Canyon Creek on Front. Didn't see it until I got home. It's untouched, and yes that's the bottom of the box you see. \"Baby kale and quinoa salad: Grilled chicken breast, diced apples (where?), caramelized sweet potatoes (joke), shaved grana podano, dried cranberries (nope), and dried candied pecans (not a chance they're in there)\". I would go back this second if they weren't closed. Canyon Creek should be ashamed, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"We came here after shopping at Vaughan Mills since it's right next door. It has been a few years since I've been to Canyon Creek but boy was this visit disappointing. We both ordered steak, and while my date's steak was decent, mine was extremely rubbery. They were both cooked properly (medium rare), but mine was just a bad cut of meat I guess. For a semi-upscale steakhouse, that's not a good thing. I've had better steak at Applebee's! The baked potato was filling and pretty good though. The bread at the beginning was nice as well with their sweet-tasting butter. The service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We ordered the filet mignon with bacon and without. Both were nice and tender but not really juicy as you would expect. I feel like I've had better sirloin steak compared to the tenderloin we got.The steak here isn't as good as what you can get from the Keg in my opinion. The amount of veggies on the side they gave was pretty small too. I did enjoy the lobster guacamole appetiser. the atmosphere is pretty nice and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we got seated pretty quick, we sat on the bar side. The restaurant is pretty cute! The lights are a bit dim, and they have a candle on each table. 

The service was okay, the waiter was pretty slow, and near closing she seemed like she was rushing everyone. Other than that, the food was pretty good, not the best but good. However, I personally loced their calamari, it was amazing! Maybe if they improve their service and the food was a bit better, I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"I was meeting friends from out of town, who were staying by the airport, and whom wanted to go to Canyon Creek. I called this location to see if 5 of us could get in at 9:15pm on a Saturday night and were told that they were very busy but that they could fit us in.

With partner in tow, we arrived first. The place was no where near busy, but they were squeezing everyone into a certain section of the restaurant. We were lead in by the host (a pretty friendly chap) who walked us past a fairly large table of approx. 20 ppl. to our table...which was a folding table that had been set up at the back of the restaurant. Seriously, a folding table. If it was just the two of us dining in, I would have left, but as we were meeting ppl (who had not yet arrived) we had no choice but to stay.

Our waitress was off the charts good. I never saw a name tag, but she was warm, efficient and had a fantastic sense of humour. She was great. 

Once again, I opted for the chipotle steak..it came out just a bit undercooked (an ongoing issue at this particular Canyon Creek) but the sauce was a perfect blend of chipotle heat/smokiness and goat cheese. Normally they're cheap with the sauce, but tonight it covered the steak...which is how I like it. I also had the Caesar Salad..and normally it is very garlicky, but it tasted like they're now using a cheaper, store bought dressing, and while I normally love their Caesar Salad, this one left much to be desired..... I forgot to order a baked potatoe so I ended up with mashed potatoes. They were good, but seeing as how that was my fault, I can't blame them. Vegetables that came with it was a medley of green beans and carrots. They were cooked perfectly. 

The reason for the low rating is based on overall experience. Our waitress did salvage the night, but the fact that you're visiting a steak house and we were shoved at the back of the restaurant and dined on a folding table, is unacceptable for this kind of establishment."}
{"text":"I had the half rack of ribs and the loaded baked potato. Didn't enjoy my ribs, they sauce tasted really weird and had a strange mouldy aftertaste. Although I didn't like the ribs, it was very soft. The loaded baked potato was delicious though. The service was also very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"this place has its ups and downs.  I remember when they took the pork chop of the menu which was stupid considering its a chop house.

that was the reason I went here in the first place for the pork chop.

their bread though is a must have with the honey butter."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a worse steak in Toronto ... I was only here because there was a 45 minute wait for a table at The Keg up the road. I will be more patient next time.
Pass on this joint it's painfully generic."}
{"text":"Last night out on a full week business trip.  Usually I try to stay away from chain restaurants, but there was little option, unless I wanted a $20 cab ride.  Decided to give Canyon Creek a try.

Decent wine selection by the glass.  Attractive and polite wait staff.  Bacon Wrapped Scallops for a starter was good with the scallops not being over cooked.  

The waitress recommended the Chicago Cut steak.  Ordered rare  - it was cooked to perfection and was an excellent choice.

I would recommend this for an upscale business dinner."}
{"text":"I visit Canyon Creek every time I am in the area for one reason -- 

Prime Rib, Prime Rib, Prime Rib 

When they are on top of their game it is up there with the best I have every had.  That said I have to agree with many of the other reviews for the price you would expect a very upscale dining experience but that does not always happen.  I have visited both for business dinners and mostly on business travel where I sit in the bar.   My best experiences have been in the bar area - I have found service to be very attentive and enjoyable.  That said I think they have gone through management issues because the dining area service seems to be very uneven and even the food not always be up to par.  That should not be at the prices they charge.

So my rating is based mostly on the bar service including a great happy hour menu especially on Wednesdays.  If it was only on the dining room area it would be 3 stars which is a shame. Therefore if you have a special occasion I would not recommend Canyon Creek until they work out the management issues.  I don't think this location is as high volume as their other locations so maybe they have problems keeping top managers.

I always ask about the doneness of the Prime Rib in advance as I like mine Rare to Medium Rare and will not order unless that is available which is usually is if you get there on the early side.  The meal comes with one appetizer .. I usually get the baked potatoes and other vegetables as well.  You get free bread which is excellent!!! The Caesar salad is quite good as well.

I have also tried the garlic shrimp ravioli which is quite good as well.  If you are there with a friend there are share appetizers which are suburb like Lobster Guacamole and the Prime Rib Sliders.  I have also tried the Calamari Fritti which is very good.

The location is convenient to the Bass Pro shop if you happen to be shopping there and are a bunch of shops in the Vaughn Mills shops.

If you love Prime Rib you need to try it here!! Also if you want to join a friend for after work drinks and some food the bar is great and they have plenty of TV's for hockey fans as well.

Hopefully they get the management issues resolved and keep the food quality where it should be for the prices."}
{"text":"Shrimp Ravioli was wonderful.  Can't wait to go back. Kaleigh was a very attentive waitress."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner in Toronto.  When seeing maple rosemary chips on the menu, this was the place we chose.  The service was excellent.  Unfortunately, the burger was dry, in Ontario if you don't grind the meat yourself you can't cook it less than medium well.  The prime rib sandwich was tasty, but it was the ends.  We enjoyed the maple rosemary chips, bread, and Caesar side salad."}
{"text":"Nice dinner and attentive waiter. Came in as a large group after work and it was nice to be seated in a private room.

Ordered...
ice wine wonder,
filet mignon, and
pumpkin brulet.

Everything was good, not spectacular, but good. I was expecting a lot from the brulet, so I was a bit disappointed. Overall quite happy!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Canyon Creek a lot, particularly this location. The prices are in the same range as the Keg, but I think the service here is superior. Although I think I enjoy the steak at the Keg more, I always have a good meal here. I usually stick with the prime rib or filet mignon. 

Whenever I ask to split my main course, they always give us extra sides (like two baked potatoes) when they split the dish. I also really love their cheesecake. Last year, they had a seasonal pumpkin cheesecake that was delectable! I really hope they bring it back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Decent service, great food, good quality meat.  We split a tasty cesar.  I orderd a new york steak with sauteed mushrooms, my husband ordered a very tender filet with a enormous loaded baked potato.  

My steak was good, didnt have much flavor, but I would definitely eat here again.  I didnt like that we were sat by the kitchen-but I got over it as soon as I ate my sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteed musrooms were unforgettale. 

Standard, dim, elegant, cabin-style decor.  Glad we decided to pop in."}
{"text":"When here for lunch with my son. The meal was so bad we could not eat chicken BLT. The was so stale and hard he could not eat it. Total waste of money!  How do you give this place no stars???"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal here before an event and the ACC. I can't remember what everyone else had but I had a peppercorn steak and baked potatoe, the steak was cooked perfectly, the service was great. enjoyed our meal very much"}
{"text":"Our food came out nearly an hour after sitting down, and my food was personally subpar for the price!! The sides were not cooked well and some of the vegetables were still tough. The mashed potatoes were very bland and the steak was cooked medium well-done, when I asked for medium-rare.

The sole reason this is review is not a one star is because of how friendly our waiter was; however, the friendliness was not enough to overcome the slow service and the subpar food. I decided to eat here for my birthday, and I sort of regret doing so. 

On vacation, so I won't be able to come back, but I don't want to anyway. Didn't want to believe the bad reviews and trusted the good ones, but my advice would be to avoid this place. Looking around, most tables were waiting on their food as well."}
{"text":"The steaks are very good here, and they will do small kid-sized cuts for younger children. My daughter loves the rib-eye.

I had a cheese burger, which was ok, but not worth the $14.50 they charge. Although it tastes freshly made, there wasn't a lot of taste to the burger.

The service is very good, our waiter paid particular attention to the children and what they wanted. Although it looks a little pretentious when you enter, they are very kid friendly.

We've been to this restaurant a number of times, and the food has generally been good, apart from the fries are very skinny and not the best. Not bad, but not great either. If it weren't for my disappointment with the burger and fries in general, I would have awarded at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner; had soup, salad and steak. The steak soup was tasty, though a bit salty for me. The Caesar salad was ok, nothing to write home about. The New York strip very good, nicely seared and juicy on the inside. Service was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Even well priced. Friendly staff. Highly recommended. Had the lobster guacamole appetizer which was excellent. Prime rib entree was very good."}
{"text":"First time visitors here from Los Angeles, California and the overall experience was great. The food was good, the service was great, bar was nice, and the ambiance was great as well. the nice waitress also searched the cable channels for the dodger game per our request but unfortunately they did not have it."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with my coworkers. This restaurant has a classy, relaxed feel to it. The wait staff was nice and friendly. We placed our orders within a few minutes of being seated.

The bartender was taking care of business, I give her credit, she kept the bar patrons happy as well as taking care of orders from those of us sitting near the bar, in booths.

I had the Original Burger and fries with a soft drink. The hamburger was a really good burger. The bun was toasted, yet very soft, no complaints! Being that It was lunch time, we were served in a very timely manner. Great staff, clean restaurant with good seating and TV's placed in good locations around the dining/bar area!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. The atmosphere was nice, but the moment I walked in I should have known that the food was garbage. The place was basically deserted. I was seated quickly by a waitress, however instead of being Intentive the waitress was paying more attention to my boyfriend then to me. Which happens a lot because people assume he is paying. We got the calamari which was amazing. And we asked the waitress about the prime rib and she stated and I quote \"that's what we're famous for\". It was was the worst thing I've ever had. The vegetables were cold, my boyfriends potatoes were cold. My steak went cold within 3 minutes and became extremely dry. It was the worst thing ever. I have never had a steak that bad. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AND FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO TRY IT REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE TASTEBUDS IT WILL NEVER SATISFY YOU."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here for special occasions or when I want a good steak. A must try is their Asian nachos!! Very good service and excellent menu"}
{"text":"Today's lunch at Canyon Creek was the best out of all the other lunch visits I have had. I'd actually give them 4.5/5 stars (y).

The service was fast and the food came out hot and fresh. The only minor thing was that our prime rib came out medium when we request medium rare. We pointed it out to our server and she happily took it back and got us the proper cooked prime rib.

Their menu has been updated and there are several new dishes I would like to try."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for a big family gathering, 13 adults plus one adorable baby. The interior wasn't as nice as the other restraints around this location. The decor looked kind of old and outdated, very suitable for older patrons. It was pretty quiet for a Friday night, there weren't many customers throughout the night.

The only disappointing thing about the night, was the service. For such a big party the tip was a mandatory 18% and it seemed like the waitress didn't care at all. Was expecting so much more from a western chain. She was hard to find at most times and was usually not there when we needed her. She also never came around to ask how the food was. Major disappointment.

Ordered almost all the appetizers on the menu (couldn't get pics because the hungry family got to them first). They were all really good, favourites were The Canyon Dip and Lobster Guacamole. The dip was creamy and cheesy while the guacamole had a fair amount of lobster chunks. Both served with tortilla chips that were prepped differently so it's okay to order both ! The entrees were also done very well, most got the prime rib which looked tender and moist (snuck a pice to try, definitely tender and flavourful). The rib eye was actually cooked right on point, medium rare and was tender and had just enough fat.

Overall, will come again maybe not in a big group as it seems they are unable to handle it."}
{"text":"Our family loves Canyon Creek!  We love the Prime Rib here and the freshly cut bread.  My kids gobble all the bread up but especially because of the honey butter.  

Sometimes we ask to share a prime rib and they split the order into two servings which is great!  It feels so nice to be able to share two smaller servings than to try to eat such a hefty portion.  Good way to cut down on the serving portions too.  They have a new side dish of Basmati rice."}
{"text":"I came to Canyon Creek craving red meat, and boy did they deliver! The prime rib was fantastic. When they were out of baked potatoes (the HORROR!), my waitress let me add all of the baked potato fixins' to a side of mashed (YAY!). The spinach dip and salsa were also tasty - we went through two baskets of chips to get through it all - and the butter they serve with the bread is nothing short of magic! Our waitress was very attentive and cute as a button, and our food didn't take long at all!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after a nice matinee at the theatre. Very little noise, nice atmosphere for a conversation, service was prompt. All the food that we had tasted great, though sometimes the portions seemed small. 

The lobster guacamole was something that stood out as great, though I don't think it lived up to its potential. It had a few large bits if lobster that should have been cut up to the same size as the other components."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a work colleague, and initially thought it would be a nice, upscale place with good food and good atmosphere - and more importantly, not a chain restaurant with poor quality.  Well, it's certainly a nice upscale restaurant, and the staff was friendly, but the food was horrible!  The only good thing about what we had was the wine!  I had the \"spit roast chicken\" and my colleague had the seared ahi tuna salad - her salad had wilted, brown pieces of lettuce all through it and the tuna looked like it had been \"seared\" a few hours earlier.  My chicken was dry, tasteless and tasted like it had been cooked the day before.  In fact, our meals came out about 6 minutes after we ordered them!  Truly, they had to be pre-prepared and heated up....ugh!"}
{"text":"From the time you step out of your car, the aroma of freshly grilled steaks fills your lungs. You walk up the entry way to find the door opened for you and a warm welcome by the hostess. They ask you how many people in your party and a preference for the lounge or dining room and a booth or table. We ask for a table in the dining room for our party of 5. Our hostess takes us to our table and menus are placed infront us as we take our seats and bask in the warm cozy ambiance under dim lighting with a fireplace flickering in the background.

Canyon creek is our go to special occasion steak house. Today we are celebrating a graduation. I've been to this location many times and service has always been wonderful and food spetacular and consistent.

Our waiter takes our drink orders and gives us time to peruse the menu. Soon after he takes our order he brings us the compliamentry bread with honey butter. I love the bread, its a freshly baked warm mini multi grain baguette paired with that sweet butter is just delicious. 

I notice they've changed a few things since the last time I've been here. The bread here is still the same but instead of a pre sliced loaf they use to give you its now in the form of mini baguettes. They have added more appetizers to the menu and The biggest difference is the steaks are slightly cheaper now but you only get 1 side, before you got 2 sides with your steak without paying extra however I guess the price reduction has compensated for that.

Our meals soon arrived. Table orders included :

Stuffed Cajun Double Chicken Breast - which is stuffed with goat cheese,
sundried tomato, and  roasted garlic with rice pilaf.
Mom and Dad got this and thoroughly enjoyed it. The portion size is hugeee. The chicken was flavoured really well and had that nice charcoal grill flavour.

They rest of us got the Grilled Top Sirloin with wild rice pilaf and I got mine with a side of fresh vegetables. They give you a hearty portion of rice and all the steaks were cooked perfectly!

My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The vegs consisted of of yellow and green beans with red peppers, they cooked perfectly not overdone still with bite with a buttery flavour garnished with sesame seeds.

Finally for dessert I had to get my favourite :

Double Chocolate Brownie topped with warm carmel sauce with Vanilla Bean Ice cream and crème anglaise.

They now serve an individual sized brownie which I opted for because the regular size is far too massive and I asked to hold the carmel sauce since I hate carmel.

The brownie is sooo decadent and fudgey and ooeey gooeey yummy and served warm with white chocolate chips throughout. The individual size is still big enough to share but trust me its sooo good you won't want too.

They serve starbucks tea/coffee so I got my favourite starbuck awake tea.

Overall another great meal at Canyon Creek! This restaurant will still always be my go to steakhouse. Come for the great service and always consistently great meals."}
