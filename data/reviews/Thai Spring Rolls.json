{"text":"I was in Aurora today to run some errands and stumbled upon Thai Spring Rolls and it turned out to be amazing! I went here for lunch with my family and we all loved it! This is a family owned restaurant and everyone was very nice. Service was top notch. The server was attentive to details and was very friendly. They have many dishes to choose from on their menu. We ordered their veggie egg rolls, pineapple fried rice, mango salad and green curry. My favourite Thai dish is green curry and it was on point. The ingredients of all the dishes were fresh and came out hot. I will definitely come back here again to try their other dishes! Overall, great atmosphere and authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"We went to Thai Spring Rolls for a weekday lunch and were greatly disappointed.

The service is okay. The waitress is friendly. And the food came to the table fast.  However, the food is just terrible.

We ordered two lunch special combos. Mine was Red Curry Beef, and my husband ordered Thai Basil chicken. For lunch special, you can choose two from spring roll, salad and soup. The spring roll is okay with nothing but cabbage as filling. The dipping sauce for the spring roll is very sweet even for a thai restaurant. The salad is the only decent thing in the whole lunch. The vegetable is fresh. However, the soup is terrible. It is very salty, and very spicy even for a hot & spicy food lover as me.  The soup is not a thai soup at all, more similar to a sour and spicy soup served in a Chinese buffet, but much more salty and spicy, and with nothing but tofu inside. 

The rice coming with the main dishes was not tasty at all, unlike the rice served in other thai restaurants. The rice seems to be the very cheap kind. Thai basil chicken is ridiculously salty. I've never eaten anything that salty in any restaurant around the world.  And if you order a dish with the name \"thai basil\", you expect that there  is some basil taste in it. However, you can't taste any basil from it. And there are only two overcooked basil leaves inside the dish. The beef in Red Curry Beef was very chewy and all the flavor of red curry didn't penetrate into the beef at all. And in both dishes, there are a lot of almost raw green bean strings, which is bland in taste and very annoying.

I don't think this restaurant serves any authenticate thai food at all. The food can hardly be called edible. It is a terrible restaurant and we will definitely not come back!"}
{"text":"Lunch special was good, 2 for 1 spring rolls or choice of soup/salad.  Topped off with solid Canadianized Pad Thai.  Friendly service, great Thai candy to finish you off."}
{"text":"The authenticity of each dish is fantastic. Not only are the prices reasonable, but the portions given are generous. Personally speaking the Pad Thai is amazing and so are the spring rolls. I'm not a fan of spicy dishes, but my husband is and always raves how good they are."}
{"text":"This experience was disappointing!

I ordered the samosas which came with no sauce and were very oily and the pineapple fried rice which had two small shrimps, no cashews and the only flavour to the dish was from the oil the rice was fried in."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this neighborhood Thai restaurant. I ordered take out tonight from the take out menu only to discover that the menu coupons was a scam! The \"free pad Thai\" with minimum $30 purchase was not honored. When asked about it to the restaurant they blatantly said that the offer was no longer valid! Why not update the take out menu if it no longer exists!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!  They need to update their coupon offerings and prices in their take out menu. Lets talk about the food......the samosas were good...pad siew was horrible..so bland, so untasteful, I had to add my seasonings when I got home...not authentic at all! The cold rolls had cilantro instead of the advertised mint in the menu...what a sham! Mint and cilantro are two different herbs..if Thai spring roll can't distinguish between the two than perhaps they need a lesson or two from a more authentic Thai restaurant.  Very disappointed...will not go back!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Markham for more than 30 years and this restaurant has been around for a while. I have tried many other Thai places in Aurora and Newmarket and this is without a doubt the best value and very good food . The Pad Thai and the Curries are are extremely good and they do takeout as well . Worth a visit , it's never too busy which is a shame ."}
{"text":"Friendly, nice atmosphere. Definitely not the best Thai food I've eaten. Basil beef was mediocre,  very salty. Pad Thai was mushy. Chicken curry had good flavor.   Mango salad however, was delicious.  Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"A lot of flavour! I stopped in for something to eat before a meeting. I wasn't too hungry, but I was too short of time. I ordered the Shrimp Basil Thai at $12.50 and a small bowl of rice. 

The dish was a bit on the small side, with only 5 large shrimp, but the flavour was excellent!  Not subtle, there was a nice heat to the sauce to complement the powerful variety of flavours. This was a very enjoyable dish, too bad the serving size wasn't a tiny bit larger. Of course I complain about eating too much anyway..."}
{"text":"Love coming here when I'm craving Thai. Staff is always friendly, and it's reasonably priced. Food is made to order and fresh. Their chicken pad sew is my favourite. They have awesome spring rolls as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in aurora - by far. This is a regular for us. Weekly at least. They do deliver - which is an added bonus but dining in is equally good. 

The spring rolls are great!  Our favorite is the spicy peanut chicken - with coconut rice. The red and green curries are equally good and the pad Thai is solid. 

Great place for any Thai fan!"}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed the food here I didn't expect it to be good but was really fresh.

Had the hot and sour soup and a chow mien and cold shrimp rolls

Everything wears fresh and had excellent flavour

Great price"}
{"text":"Went at lunchtime. The $8.50 lunch special was very good value. We started with a tasty vegetarian spring roll accompanied by a thick hot and sour soup. Soup was tasty, however it was warm and not served piping hot. 
My Ginger Chicken was very good. Lots of tender white chicken and very fresh vegetables cooked perfectly. Subtle taste of ginger. There was fresh slivers of ginger in the dish. 
My partners vegetarian dish was Cashew Nut with Tofu and Vegetables. Once again the vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly. There was fresh orange in the dish, giving it a slightly sweeter taste. 
Included Jasmine tea was served with loose leafs. 
Service was excellent, and we felt comfortable lingering over our tea to chat, after lunch."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by my customer, who's a Thai cook herself. The owner's actually from Laos and makes authentic Lao dishes. They do try to include as much Asian cuisine as possible, but I'd stick to their roots, Northern Thai and Laos. The staff are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Newmarket/aurora area. I've been coming here for years and their food is the best!"}
