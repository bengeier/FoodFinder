{"text":"Filthy and run-down. Walked into the room and found a dirty glass on the nightstand, and a cigarette lighter under the pillow. It's non-smoking, yet we saw people go in and out of rooms with lit cigarettes which explains the awful smell. So disappointed - I love supporting small, local motels vs. chains, but we cancelled our stay here and will never return. I hope someone buys this and fixes/cleans it up; you can tell that in its heyday it was probably great."}
{"text":"This place was creepy!!  Dark hallways with no lights on made parts of the hotel feel abandoned. The sheets were torn as well as the curtains. Even the wallpaper was coming off the walls. The furniture was dusty and it felt like there was sand in the drawers. We planned to stay 3 nights but checked out after one. We didn't have anywhere else to go the first night so we bought some Lysol spray and Clorox wipes and cleaned the place ourselves. The only thing that was ok was the bathroom. It was clean. The room rate was cheap but I wouldn't even say you get what you pay for in this case. We will never stay there again."}
{"text":"Hi guys  I am a seasoned photographer,that has shot around the world.I have stayed in every possible type and grade of hotel motel,Inn.This place is a gem,for 55 bucks it's a fun place that has seen it's heyday but is clean and comfortable.I was in the area with a bunch of Lands' End expats,who  recommended it. I would not compare it to a Four  Seasons but I think that you're missing the point if you do.I want to get back there when the snow goes and hit Gordon Creek with my 4 weight. Lots of hot water for the shower by the way."}
{"text":"On a 5 degree February night, we got into our freezing room. The heater was luke warm at best. The manager assured us the room would warm up after 20 minutes. It didn't. He brought a space heater, possibly from the WWII era, and warned us not to fall asleep with it on the carpeted floor (yikes!). We huddled around it for 45 minutes with winter hat and gloves on and the room still wasn't warm. He explained that it was \"cold inside because it was cold outside\". I argued that's why \"inside\" was invented! We asked for our money back. He came back to our room, this time suspiciously without his winter hat, coat, and in his socks claiming it felt warm to him. He offered us a different room, but its heater was just as not-warm.   He finally agreed to give us a FULL refund but insisted he couldn't run the refund until morning. We stopped by the next evening after the refund had not shown up. In the office, what had absolutely no heat on, he produced a receipt proving he did the refund, but then we noticed it was $7 short. He justified this because he gets charged by the credit card company to run the card and the refund. We argued to have the full refund he agreed to. He said we were difficult customers.   He finally agreed to refund our remaining $7 but then it took another 10 minutes to get him to put in writing. He never refunded it."}
{"text":"Omg no!!! BEDBUGS!!! Passing through and needed a room. Took a peek in what they had and poked around... place was crawling with them!!!!"}
{"text":"How or why I wasn't murdered in this place is beyond me. There was a crazy thunderstorm and everything. At least the residents drinking beer in office chairs in the parking lot went in once the rain came. Again, wasn't murdered though. So...yay?   PS this an absolutely true story."}
{"text":"So I had made reservations to stay at the Karakahl Country Inn last weekend. First of all, I had found a number of both positive and negative reviews about this place but ultimately decided to go with the Karakahl because I didn't want to spend a lot for lodging overnight the price was only $59 for a room with 2 queen beds. From what I could find there weren't any other hotels in Mt. Horeb besides the karakahl and the Village Inn. Lastly, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright so i'm thinking well that's kind cool huh? Okay, so upon driving up my initial impression was WOW what a dump!!! The place needs some serious exterior maintenance! *hint hint* a few gallons of paint can go a long way and the pool building looks like they may have started to do some maintenance but then abandoned it. Sorry no pool here folks. So at this point I came pretty close to turning the car around and running but didn't...  The gentleman that checked us in was very nice and polite (ok some points there) and we were sent around to upper back portion to locate our room. It's very private in the back and we were pleasantly surprised to walk into a very tidy clean room. Clean sheets, bed was comfy, room had a refridgerator and the rooms opened to an inner hall that had lovely skylights it was quite nice (if only it was a wee updated) Outside all the rooms were these retro starlike light fixtures that are actually pretty interesting to look at after dark. Just a couple other things to note are that the walls are paper thin and there were a group of girls staying next door so we could hear them as if they were in our room. The shower kinda sucked my travel companion took a cold shower with great water pressure, while mine was hot with barely any water pressure. BUT all in all it served it's purpose it was an inexpensive place to stay and I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the minor negatives. Maybe the place is hurting but seriously even just a little exterior paint would do a world of difference. I can see it having been a great place at one time and has serious potential especially in that charming little town!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying every review is accurate. The place has seen better days, the rooms are out dated and cleaning isn't a top priority. We booked a room here for the same reason everyone else did......ITS CHEAP and they had rooms available, plus for us they took dogs. I wasn't expecting much when I made a reservation and when we got there I wasn't wrong. The motel has a great architecture design and looks like it could be by Frank Lloyd Wright but I googled it and it was designed by John Steinmann and he was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. He also designed the medical building next door as well.   The best thing I can say about our stay was the ice machine worked fantastic. I filled up our cooler before we left and it barely melted any and actually started to freeze a few water bottles. And for that reason and that reason only I gave 5 stars. What can I say, the dog loves ice cold water and we love the dog. So Thank You Karakahl for the awesome ice!!! You out did yourself!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin. We booked this place sight unseen as a place to sleep for just a night between sightseeing.   Immediately upon arrival you realize it's a place that many people live, seemingly unbeknownst to anyone that owns the place. The facilities are below even about as bad as I could have imagined.   We canceled our nights stay and paid double to stay in a place where we were confident in not being robbed/stabbed/awaken by a meth bust.    Don't do it."}
{"text":"I wish I had read more reviews of this hotel before we decided to spend the night! My fiancee & I planned a last minute Wisconsin getaway and I decided on the Karakahl because it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Unfortunately, this historic hotel has degenerated into quite a dump! There were stains all over the first room we were given. The comforters, towels, carpet, and walls were old and dingy. There was no bed skirt on one of the beds, and a huge reddish-brown stain was visible on the box frame. When we pulled back the sheets there were eyelashes and hairs on the bed. We called the office and they offered us another, upgraded room. Because it was late, freezing outside, and we were only spending one night, we accepted. The manager was very friendly & apologetic, but I would never stay at the Karakahl again unless it was under new management. After seeing that one room, I just don't trust them."}
{"text":"My soon to be wife asked weeks in advance if we could book a couple of rooms just to shower and change in. We were having a wedding at a county park in Mt. Horeb and there were no facilities there. I had to help set up that morning at the park and didn't have time to drive back to Madison afterwards. This hotel would have been a perfect place as a sort of staging area.  When I arrived, the guy at the front counter acted like a jerk. He was confused as to why we were there even after I politely explained the situation. He still hesitated and said, \"I don't know if we have any clean rooms available.\" Are you kidding me? This place is not the Hyatt. There were like 3 cars in the parking lot and about 50 rooms. Meanwhile, I'm in a hurry and this guy is still questioning me like I'm lying and I'm just dying to get into this run down hotel a couple hours before check-in time.  I called my fiance to make sure she made the reservation and she assured me she did. This guy regardless of not knowing about our reservation couldn't seem to wrap his head around what we were using the room for. I might has well have been talking to the pen on the counter. He was just a total curmudgeon. All this hassle just to pay  full price for using a crappy hotel for literally less then an hour to shower and change.  Any normal person would have said, \"Congratulations, here is your key! Have a nice day.\""}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but the building was old and run down. Absolute worst part was the walls were so think you could hear everything from your neighbors flushing the toilet to people talking outside at 4 in the morning. I stayed one night and just wanted to sleep....didn't turn out well. (MOVE THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE AC SHIELD. If you don't, your room won't cool down, and it gets HOT in those old rooms). Vending machines were a minimum stock, just candy."}
{"text":"EDIT:  Additional stars!!  I thought I left my hard drive there and called the business.  Of course, I thought I'd never hear from them again as I've left things behind before and no one EVER calls back from a hotel.  These guys did!!!  I couldn't believe it!!!  Over a month later and they called me back.  It was not my item, (whoever left their Garmin there - call them!) but the mere face that they returned my calls really says a lot for management.  I still contend that this place could use a renovation, but really, you can't beat service like that.  Way to go, Karakahl!  This place was pretty cool and I think you need to have perspective when you stay.   The architecture is really neat. Our tidy room had these amazing wood beams on the ceiling.  The pool was clearly once a gorgeous structure. The pool is still in decent shape but the building and the facilities around it could use a facelift. The starry pillars are a really fun touch.   It's near a lot of fun spots. Mt. Horeb, New Glarus, Madison, Cave of the Mounds.   I think that if the owners put some money into it, it could be a really awesome place."}
{"text":"It is a shame ... no, it is a crime, that this place has been allowed to slip so far into the abyss. If you look at the architectural bones of the place it is seriously cool. Yes, it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, which is why we chose to stay here in the first place.  A simple coat of paint and a few nails and screws in the right places would go a long way to restore this place to a much higher level. Throw in a few new mattresses and box springs and you'd have an oasis located in downtown Mt. Horeb.  It made me think about how back in the old Roman era, there must have been a time when someone commented that the old Coliseum was starting to look tacky and run down. Today it is a beloved beautiful ruin. Somehow, I don't think Karakahl Country Inn will ultimately achieve beloved beautiful ruin status, so I think someone, somewhere better spruce the place up or we will lose a FLW treasure."}
{"text":"Well the website makes it look better than it is. The lobby smelled of old man. Our room had holes in carpet and the carpet was filthy. And Bed Bugs!!!!!!! Yes, we just found a ton of bed bug bites!! But hey, that's what you get for $55 right?"}
{"text":"Gross! Room was dirty. Sheets had not been changed, found long black hair under the pillow. The bathroom had mold and mildew. Heat barely worked. This place should be condemned. Sure it is a deal because they have resident junkies living there, drinking beers and smoking pot at 9 am! Could not wait to leave. Suprised my truck was not broken into.Honestly, avoid this rat trap and keep driving."}
