{"text":"There is no one to greet you at the front and no one to seat you unless you insist on being seated. This is probably due to the fact that they are absolutely understaffed with one person working the tables, front etc. Once seated we were not even served water, absolutely nothing until we asked ourselves to order. I feel bad for the one waitress who has to do everything so it is not her fault, just unbelievable they have one person doing everything. Once we ordered we did not receive drinks until we once again asked for them,  or appetizers for 30  minutes. #1 rule = food quality is irrelevant with horrible service. I really hope this place gets it together because it's in a great location and looks great as well. Honestly worst service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"We had stumbled upon this cute little restaurant while strolling through Unionville and decided to try it out for lunch. OMG!!! The fire rolls were heaven with the warm cream cheese, crab meat and crispy tempura coating, the crunchy rolls with fresh buttery avocado and yummy shrimp tempura were out of this world!!!! We had two orders of udon (veggie for my hubby and beef for myself), accompanied with a large hot sake and green tea (Yup, we like to eat! :-)) Everything was fresh and delicious! The server was courteous and attentive. The chef was a gem! If I could give six stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Theres not many places to eat meals in Unionville . Didnt wanted to eat at pubs so stopped by at Asuka Sushi. I ordered beef teriyaki, unionville crunch roll, spicy crunch dynamite roll. Taste fantastic (actually one of the best teriyaki i have tried in toronto) and i really liked the friendly service from the waitress. In summer they are planning to open the patio with beers (thats what the waitress said) so i will Definately come back and try their other menus"}
{"text":"This little joint knows their rolls, there's no two ways about that. Although all I've tried were the Avocado Cucumber, Green Dragon, and Polar Bear rolls, they were enough to impress.  I must admit, I was a little taken aback by the price of the rolls, but trust me, it's worth the splurge! Plus, the rolls came with complimentary spring salad and miso soup, which basically complete the meal. The avocado cucumber roll came in six huge pieces stuffed with large, perfectly ripe chunks of buttery avocado.   Then we had the Green Dragon Roll which was easily the best green dragon I've had around Toronto with freshly fried shrimp tempura that's still super light and crispy even nearing the end of the meal. Again, the quality and quantity of avocado was above and beyond.  Last but not least was the Polar Bear roll, which was so rich and decadent it definitely left us in no need of dessert. Firm fleshed, delicately charred and lightly smoky slices of white tuna covered the entire roll. A little on the rich side, and certainly not a minimalist, pristine sort of roll, but delicious without a doubt.  Overall, a very pleasant little surprise to unearth in quiet Unionville."}
{"text":"I went to Asuka Fusion Sushi the other day just to try it - word of mouth said it was pretty good. Given it was so small, I was a little apprehensive. I shouldn't have been. I ordered the Sashimi plate - and it was wonderful. Probably the freshest and best fish I have ever had. Very nice people as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"OK, I've been here three times in the last 2 months and each time really enjoyed :   - The food - good sushi, sashimi and rolls. Maybe a tiny  bit more pricey than other decent sushi places around the area, but this is Unionville Main Street!  - The Welcome.The owner and the waiter provided a really warm welcome and both remembered our names and the waiter even remembered what we liked to eat  - The Patio. Where else can you eat good Japanese on such a nice patio on such a nice street.  Asuka deserves to get a lot more customers trying them out. As soon as they do they will definitely come back for more, especially if they are locals, like we are.  When we eat out in the Markham area, more often than not, we go for sushi and I rate Asuka up there with the best of them. The food is consistently good and the welcome and option to eat on the patio make it a winner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located on main st. Unionville... cute and small. I ordered spicy salmon roll and Dynamite roll for lunch. The quality of the fish was mediocre but definitely not worth the price. The service on the other hand was not that great... I had to get up 3 times to go to  the kitchen and ask for drinks and the bill. Spent $50 for lunch.. left unsatisfied. =("}
{"text":"I took a group of 16 co-workers for dinner - most had never had sushi but the others have been to Sushi places around the world.  We found this to be one of the top 3 sushi places that we have been too.  Quality Fantastic, Quantity Fantastic, Price Fantastic, Hospitality Fantastic...only down size was dinning room space but they made it work and everyone had a great time.  This is by far one of the best sushi places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Coming in the to the restaurant caught me off guard at first seeing how small the place was but the food was delicious. I would recommend anyone to try their burritos and specialty rolls if they come by this little joint."}
{"text":"I've always took note of this quaint little place in Unionville whenever I drove by the area.  We had a chance to check it out this past weekend.  It was a beautiful warm summer's night so we opted to be seated in the patio, which was a mistake as mosquitoes were out in full force! Despite the restaurant having had those anti-mosquitoes incense, they still came out in full force.  We and the other patrons were literally their dinner for the evening!  After awhile though, we decided to be asked to be moved indoors instead as we couldn't stand it anymore.   For our own dinner, we settled on the Asuka Sushi, a red dragon roll and the crunchy noodle soup.  Food arrived quickly even though they had a full house on their patio.  Good service thus far.  I'm not a fan of the purple rice they used in their rolls and nigiri, at least, not this evening. For one, it was very overcooked and moist, which made it very unappetizing to eat.  The rolls were huge as a result.  The rice was also bland, I could not taste the vinegar in the rice that most sushi places uses.  We think they rushed the cooking of the rice because of the packed house. Too bad as having good rice in sushi makes all the difference.  At least, the fish in our sushi (tuna, salmon, white tuna) were fresh and cut to the right proportions, but the over abundance of overcooked rice down played the overall taste a little bit.  The noodles in the crunchy noodle soup were also soft and overcooked, the broth was under seasoned.  We may come back on a less busier day to give them another chance to see if they can improve on tastes."}
{"text":"The sushi here is never disappointing. And the sushi burrito is a perfect size for lunch or dinner. We usually do take out, and the owners and staff are always very friendly and accommodating.   You should try it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day with my family, GREAT Sushi - Everyone loved it. Fresh. Great service too. They have a lot of fusion options with tempura but are able to make it without which is awesome. Really enjoyed it here and will definitely come back. Always looking for a local gem!"}
{"text":"This place is famous for their rolls so I just had to try it!  It was nice and cozy inside the shop and the lady was very nice! We made some small talk and she was super friendly! :)  I was looking over the rolls and she recommended the most popular. I ended up with the polar bear roll and the specials of that day with beef tataki!  They were all delicious and I love how the rice is not the plain old white sushi rice! The presentation was also lovely.   I was only eating with my mom so we didn't order too much :(  The overall atmosphere was lovely and I'll definitely go again with my friends to try the other rolls!"}
{"text":"**MUST EAT** Their fire roll makes me want to cry... because it is the best sushi I have ever tasted in my life. Totally had the \"mmm\" spark.. The combination of cream cheese, soft, chewy, and warm rice with a light hint of spicy sauce and crispy tempura really hit it. I felt warmth & comfort from this sushi roll.   Black dragon roll and California roll were also amazing. There's just something about the texture and quality of each ingredient they use that made the experience so great. The service was excellent as well especially with their good timing of tea refills.  Though the price was a bit pricey, I would definitely be coming back again for my fire roll :')"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday only because I had to wait for my dog to be groomed at the groomer's next door. So I only ordered the super basics: shrimp tempura, spicy salmon roll with Sapporo beer (on tap).   Unfortunately, although the battered shrimps tasted good, they were definitely not shrimp tempura. They were literally just battered shrimp.   The spicy salmon were very \"meh\".  Not bad tasting, but other than being larger, they were no more flavourful than spicy salmon I can easily and cheaply get from T&T Supermarket.   Last but not least...flat beer. The Sapporo beer was flat flat flat.   Spent $20 for all of the above, it's not worth the number of unnecessary calories that entered my body."}
{"text":"Asuka Fusion Sushi is a cute little Japanese restaurant located in Old Unionville.   White picketed fence, a patio with mismatched furniture, small and family owned... I really want to like Asuka.. But...  Lunch Special Weekday till 3 pm from $9.95  This is the first time ever I ate a Chirashi ($13.95) that has shari rice served microwaved warm.... The fish got a little warm because of that too...   I feel sorry for this nice waitress/sushi chef/cook.. she is the only one here.. but that way how she prepared my lunch makes me not wanting to come back again."}
