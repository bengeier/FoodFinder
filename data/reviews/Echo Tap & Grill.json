{"text":"Just had lunch at Echo. First, the patio was absolutely delightful . . . a great place to spend a lazy afternoon. Second, the service was amazing! I don't know our server's name but the date was Sept 5 and the time was early afternoon and she was the only person serving the entire patio and she never missed a beat. Third, too bad the food didn't match the ambience or the quality of the service . . . it was beyond bad. The chicken salad was meant to be gummed and not eaten (definitely processed chicken that never saw the light of any coop!) and, to top it off, it was tasteless. My hubby's pork sandwich was equally uneventful. The chips were Lay's and not homemade like a lot of other local bars. (Note: The table next to us ordered pizza and it did look good. I was tempted to ask for a slice.) Went home hungry . . . not going back soon."}
{"text":"Alright setup, nice furniture, nothing out of the blue here, but bad service. I was DD-ing and the bartender charged me for a soda, called \"last-call\" well before commonplace last-call time, and was generally rude. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time...looking for a place to watch the Brewers. Walked in, wasn't greeted so I found my own table right by the door. Table was dirty and it took just under 15 minutes from that time to get noticed and get my first beer. When she came over, she never cleaned the table. Server finally took my order for pizza (supreme on thin rust) and curds. Curds are nothing to write home about.  Pizza crust was soggy except the very outer edge, which fails in my books for thin crust. The toppings were not even cooked and still raw. The sauce was bland and seems like straight out of a can. The gal that was supposed to be my server never stopped back to ask how things were and I finally got my second beer after an hour of being there. I certainly will not be back, so much better at Jordan's Big10!"}
{"text":"Server was very helpful and accommodating to our large group. Sat upstairs and she even changed the TV to what we wanted. Good food and gray bloody Mary's.  Will return"}
{"text":"Great local pub. Really disappointed about the no pizza thing during the week. Wish you would bring this back."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best bar food in the city.  With their recent expansion, adding a HUGE new kitchen and updating the interior, some might say that the Echo has lost it's feel.  Not true.  The food is as good as it has been in the past, and with the addition of some pizza ovens, there are a lot of great offerings.  
Start with the echo burger (a great appetizer for two if you cut it in half), then once your friends come, order a calzone for a second small plate.  Just cut it in to 8 pieces because it is very large. ($9)
Once your appetite is going, up the ante with a round of Jagermeisters to really get the juices flowing.  If you're lucky it's Thursday.  Five tacos for $4.  Get a few rounds of those crispy little devils and finish up with another round of Jagermeisters.  
The Echo Tap has a lot going on, and for those of you who try to deny it's greatness, think again."}
{"text":"For a sports bar, I found them rather unaccommodating. I requested that they play a game, and I received a surprising amount of pushback. While it was on at the same time as a Wisconsin game, which was understandably on most TVs as it is the home team, no one was able to direct me to a TV that could play that game. I was disappointed in the customer service and flexibility."}
{"text":"Used to be a 2, Now it's a 4.

This place USED to be dingy, sticky floored, and smelly. The taps always tasted dirty too.

NOT THE CASE NOW! Now its pretty damn good! 

They've completely redone the interior and added a nice little patio outside. Many more TVs than there used to be too, and they are nice new ones. Also, they pipe the game audio over the PA for all the big games.

The beer selection leaves something to be desired, but they almost always have a solid seasonal microbrew, and some Capital on tap. All the lines taste clean now too, which is awesome. They could definitely use some more Wisconsin craft taps though. They have all the staples for you macro lovers though.

Pretty friendly townie staff that will give you shit on occasion, so don't come if you have no personality or are easily offended.

Food is pretty decent for bar food, and cheap. The cheese curds are definitely passable, but not the best in town at all. Their pizzas are pretty good too.

Some random notes:
- The bar stools are pretty uncomfortable, but you forget about it after a few beers.
- Clientele can be quite interesting sometimes, from stumble drunks to college sorority girls. It's a pretty interesting mix.
- They don't charge extra if you forget to close out your tab at the end of the night.
- Good drink specials
- The reviews on here from 2010 and earlier don't really apply anymore, since they remodeled the entire place. 
- Awesome spot to watch sports.

{"text":"Echo has an awesome patio this time of year.  

Last night I enjoyed an appetizer of plain chicken wings and a chicken salad sandwich.  The wings were crispy and delicious. The chicken salad sandwich was fantastic; toasted wheat with piles of chicken, grapes, cranberries, and walnuts. So good!

If you're only going for food and drink, maybe check out when their trivia night is and avoid it? Our server was a little overwhelmed with our arrival and I think it was due to trivia going on inside. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Good service and a wide variety of beers for a decent price. Just stopped in for a beer but very happy."}
{"text":"I had a fish sandwich on a Friday afternoon. It was very average. Thinking this isn't the thing for this place though..."}
{"text":"The Echo Tap is the most genuine Wisconsin bar in Madison. They not only have the coldest beer and Jäger in town, but the food is excellent as well. The Echo burger is a must try; with 1beef patty, 1brat patty, one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of cheddar all topped with sautéd onions. I am a very happy visitor."}
{"text":"The chicken cordon blue was amazing.  They where a little under staffed but food was coming out fast."}
{"text":"Well, Im wondering if some of the reviewers had partaken of drinking a tad much and then eating.  Im not sure what all the hype is about.  Their burgers and chicken sandwiches are way overpriced for BAR food.  I would expect more for $9 (when you add extras). Dont get me wrong, they are not BAD, but not worth the money (chicken was DRY DRY DRY).  Small sized, not that tasty. We had ordered delivery, but I doubt that changes the quality and size much?  And they sent a very small amount of fries, too.  Also forgot to put the extra fixing on the deluxe burger, which is $1.50 add on.  BOOO!  The breaded mushrooms were undercooked (not just cold) and still doughy.  I dont think I will ever order delivery from them.  I wonder if they really just dont want to deliver, so they end up sending not so good food."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for a year, and whenever I think about missing Wisconsin, my mind goes immediately to the Echo Tap. As people have said, this is a quintessential Wisconsin bar, from the High Life on tap to the darts to the crowd.

I used to go here with a friend every Monday, order a pitcher of High Life (on special, for $4.50 I think) and two shot glasses, and do a power hour at the bar. One time, another patron gave me advice on getting a tattoo and hooked my friend up with a discount for a piercing. Another time, a patron told us how he knew the woman in the moon on the High Life packaging.

There are darts and pool on the second floor, of course, and the drinks are super-cheap even before their insanely priced specials. The bartender chats with the regulars, and it's an especially fun place to watch Packers games (or depressing, depending on the outcome, but I lived there in 2007 so it was great).

It's the perfect bar, basically."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review about a week late but better late than never. I stopped in Echo Tap for some dinner takeout around 8 on a weeknight. Walked up to the bar asked for a menu, and the bartender asked if I'd like to something to drink while I waited (very polite). I ordered a spotted cow and looked over the menu. Placed an order for 2 bacon burgers and a order of Cowboy bites. The wait wasn't long, about the same time I finished my beer the food was ready. Great place to eat, I have never eaten in house but regularly use grub hub for delivery. Fantastic food."}
{"text":"When I was in college, Echo was where all my hip student radio station friends would go in search of stories that would make you cringe come Sunday morning. It was dingy enough to satisfy dive bar needs but sketchy enough to make you seem edgy in comparison to all your Plaza-going friends. White girl from the suburbs of Minnesota needs all the edge she can get.

Echo has since been revamped as of last summer or so and while I miss some of the \"edge\", I usually get by just fine as I'm conquering one of their delicious, giant calzones. Also, after [an attempt at] playing tennis last week, my friend introduced me to the fact that Echo dishes out 5 tacos for $4 on Thursdays. Nothing compliments tennis quite like tacos so we nabbed a table inside, grabbed a beer and placed our orders with the friendly waiter. He looked at us with an eyebrow raised (probably having confused us with Maria Sharapova and Anna Kournikova) and asked whether we were planning to share the 5 tacos. Ha - silly, rabbit. \"That'll be 5 tacos each please.\"

Nothing crazy unique going on here but it's a comfortable venue with an adequate beer selection, enjoyable bar food and saucy-ish tennis players."}
{"text":"I almost laughed at the \"& Grill\" stuck on the end of this listing.  I guess they have food...right?  I know you can order out and bring it in...Well now that I think of it, having food sounds about right.

After avoiding it like the plague for several months, I found myself at Echo for the first time during an excruciating Madison winter.   It was literally the closest bar to our apartment (as in, half a block away).  As most of my husband's UW friends lived in our building, that's where we ended up going.

I should preface this by saying that Echo is right across the street from the Greyhound bus depot.  Thus, there are dozens of homeless, drunken, scruffy vagabonds that traipse up and down this street at any given point, including right in front of -- and sometimes inside -- the bar.  Do not pay them any mind.  They're more like the Echo Tap bodyguards than a threat.  They, like you, just want to get drunk and forget about their problems.

Now, onto the bar itself.  From the outside, it looks like a trailer.  Inside, as expected, was a horde of local winos and UW grads from the class of '69, but also TWICE THE SPACE that anyone would have thought.  Are you kidding me?  Two floors?  Darts AND a pool table?  And, the most thrilling discovery of all, an AWESOME digital jukebox?

Also, they ask you \"single or double?\" when you ask for a drink that any other place would just water down and give you less than a single.  I had two large vodka crans here and was fiiiiiiine without that $5 pitcher of Spotted Cow.  But of course I had the Cow anyway.

A great place to hang out with friends!  It's stuck in a moment, in the best way.  In the dead of winter, when I wish I could just hop out for a night out, I'll miss this place a lot."}
{"text":"It took me a while to figure out the Echo.  I never even bothered with it for the first few years, but I was wasting time on Lower State Street and wouldn't have known a quality neighborhood bar anyway.  When you're 21 you figure a place like the Echo is for the Old People.  And that's not completely untrue, because this place is rarely full of young college kids.  And that's maybe why I've started to like the Echo more and more.  I started meeting friends down there for an after-class burger and a beer during my last year of college.  It quickly became a regular destination and a favorite place to kick back, relax and bully the jukebox.

I last dropped by the Echo after a hockey game at the Kohl Center, which is quickly becoming a habit.  Sometimes the place gets a bit too busy after a game but this wasn't one of those times.  The Echo has one of the better tap selections in Madison but for me it almost always comes down to the Sprecher Black Bavarian.  This is one of my all-time favorite beers and to find it on tap is a special treat.  Seriously - four stars just for having Black Bavarian on tap.  I'm told that the mix drinks are quite good but nothing's going to pry me away from my Black Bavarian.  The bartenders are quick and friendly unless the place is very crowded.  The bar area becomes a bit of a bottleneck and it can be difficult to get a beer.  

I don't get food at the Echo all that often anymore but it is quite good.  They do a truncated menu on game days that leaves off my favorites, so I don't usually go here to eat on these days.  Other nights it's a relaxing place to grab a table and have a good time.  I especially like the cajun porkchop sandwich and the BLT.  It's served on French bread and is evidence of how something simple can be great.  But for the most part I stick to having a pre or post-game drink at the Echo.  I still run into a lot of old friends and acquaintances at this bar as well, which always makes for a good time.  Maybe I'm becoming an Old Person now, but the Echo is one of my favorite downtown destinations these days."}
{"text":"The MC for trivia on Thursday nights is great! That being said, the waitstaff is terrible. The guy serving our table, Jacob, lost track of his tabs and added two pitchers on ours we never ordered. When we asked for a correction he blamed us from trying to steal and not paying for what we received. Management was equally as accusatory. After a whole ordeal they finally took the added pitchers off of our tab, but not without complaint and guilt tripping us. It was all unnecessary and disrespectful. If you're cool with delayed service and potentially paying for something you never ordered...this is a great pick for trivia...otherwise I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well we were with a large party that came in. The whole bar was full so my son & I sat outside in the party room. 25-30 min went by & I discovered the rest of my group was eating in the main part of the restaurant. I went inside and informed a waiter. He was very apologetic & service commenced after that.Son had the burger which he reported as dry but ok. I ordered the drunken beef supposedly marinated beef with a bbq or similar type sauce, smoked gouda cheese, &  and giardenera. 
What came , shocked me! Slightly burnt dry toast, dry flavorless beef with a dark colored sauce and some sort of celery with chopped up jalopenos and a tiny  bit of cheese which sure the hell wasnt smoked gouda! I shouldn't hv eaten it nor the onion rings which were overcooked. They hustled to get us our food & it isnt cooked right. I am now feeling ill. Feel like yakking as Im typing. The server kept apologizing but several others in the group said the food was under par as well. Wouldnt recommend going there."}
{"text":"Who would have thought you could find a dive townie bar in downtown Madison surrounded by the UW Campus? But that is exactly what the Echo Tap is. If you are sick of the college bars and want to go to a place with a lot of character I suggest the Echo. This place has it's share of fun regulars that are certain to keep you entertained. The upstairs has 3 dart boards and a pool table. You can also get food like burgers, fries, chicken tenders, and the usual bar food. The echo also sells cigarettes and small bottles of liquor. Anytime is the best time to go but expect crowds while activities are going on at the Kohl Center.

Also ask if you can join the \"PBR Priority Club\""}
{"text":"We came for some March Madness action to watch the Badgers (of course).  So happy our friend recommended this place!  Our service was prompt and our drinks and food were delicious!  I highly advise you to ask to sit in Steve's section if he is working!  He was a STELLAR server.  He was always checking in to see if we were comfortable, needed more to drink, and were enjoying our stay.  We told him we would be ready to order some food about half time and he said he would check in with us...  Even though he was busy with a whole bunch of tables, he still came by to check on us seconds before half time ended.  You will not get a more attentive server than Steve.  He even brought us tickets for the bucket raffle before we even asked about it. Which is another plus...  Who can beat a chance to have your tab paid for?  Even if it doesn't happen, it's still worth the chance!  Thanks, Steve and Echo Tap, for a great experience!  We will be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: crowded neighborhood hangout pub.

I never came to Echo Tap as a student at UW-Madison, but I've been back since graduating. It's on the outskirts of campus, and is frequented more by upperclassmen and locals than drunk frat boys. It still gets rowdy, though, simply because of how packed it can get. 

It's a small space with seating upstairs and down and tons of TVs. It seemed like everyone knew everyone. Our long islands were fine, but with the music so loud and the lack of space it's not someplace I'd hang out for more than one drink. Nice, but not too nice. Have heard the food is worth staying for."}
{"text":"Seems to be a pretty nice place. I went there last night for Team Trivia, and there was a good crowd.

Great selection of local beer on tap, and good options. Their fries were delicious.

The staff was attentive and the bathrooms were clean. Can't really complain about anything!"}
{"text":"Very solid bar food that comes delivered! I highly suggested any of their grilled cheese sandwiches and my boyfriend is a fan of their burgers (especially the echo burger). I gave Echo a 4-star because delivery was over an hour wait, at 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night. I thought this was a little long. Also, we ordered mild wings, that were great, but they were $10 for 6 wings. We thought that was a little over priced. Overall, very good food. This was was my second time ordering there."}
{"text":"It can be NUTS when it's super busy, but on other days, I really like it. Lots of TVs for viewing, and the staff is always very friendly. Terrific burger!"}
{"text":"So my family got together for dinner and the Echo Tap was the place of choice for my sister (birthday girl).  None of us have never been there before with the exception of my wife who had been there way back in the day.   So dinner is on our minds and we had a good time!

First off we had a decent size group with kids so we sat upstairs and the music was very loud but they turned that down.  I like bars that feel like bars and the Echo tap did for sure feel like a bar and PBR on tap...perfect!

Cheese Curds = Always awesome especially since they were lightly breaded!

Now for my meal I wanted to go for what I hear they were known for and that is the Cheeseburger.  I got it and was surprised on how small it was but the taste totally outweighed the small size of the burger because it was an excellent burger.  Not your typical pre-made burger slapped on a grill..these burgers were handmade for sure and awesome!

My wife got the pizza and much to my surprise, it was very good.  Now, being good does not make it a place I would go to just to get pizza but much better than other bars who just toss in a frozen pizza.

Overall a good night and a good place to eat of have drinks."}
{"text":"Vegans beware! My vegan friend was just informed that her request for a basic vegetable wrap would inconvenience the kitchen too much and that she should order the veggie burger which has tofu - unfortunately she's allergic to soy. Awkwardness ensued. Eventually they did give her a delicious veggie wrap.

The hummus was really good - the bread especially was delicious. You also shouldn't miss out on the cheese curds.

I went with the crispy chicken sandwich and added guacamole which was absolutely the right choice. 

Overall a solid enough experience - there are definitely better burger joints in Madison but if you're here for Trivia (Thursdays & Sundays) or just to watch a game it's a great spot."}
{"text":"I have passed this neighborhood bar down the street from me many a times and dubbed it the \"old people\" hang out. However, during a Wisconsin game, you can bet the crowd will be young, vibrant, and different and dressed to the nines in red.  Although it looks small inside, it has surprisingly high ceilings and a second floor loft. Which made it easy for a group of 4 of us to all get a place to sit around a table. The beer in the pitchers starts flowing and a few bags of cool ranch Doritos are opened up. Okay, so I'll give this place an extra star for the pure convenience of going (since it's literally a hop, skip, and jump away)."}
{"text":"Great dive bar. 2 levels so that is a plus and a great selection of taps. Also, great place to park and grab one for any event at the Kohl Center. Go Badgers!"}
{"text":"I used to live cater-cornered from Echo Tap, and used to order delivery almost every drunken Saturday night.  

Ethereal bar food.
The cheese curds were always sublime- best cheese curds in the area (the Depot's curds don't come close).  Cheeseburgers melted in my mouth, and the buns were deliciously caramelized with grease or butter.

Delivery service was always fast and polite. 

Sometimes I would go into the bar with a friend and order food to go, and sit at the bar to wait.  We would order drinks and were always served promptly, and the drinks were always strong."}
{"text":"Great gathering place with super food and good drinks! 

Went to the Echo with a group of 10 work colleges and all were satisfied.  we had a great server who really hustled, and given we were on the second floor, he had a lot of up and down the stairs.  

In our group there were a number of mixed drinks and assorted beers.  All were great.  We ordered pizza (which is the best around) burgers, chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders.  Everyone  enjoyed their food and when the bill came we were more than satisfied with the quantity and quality of food and drink to the cost. 

We'll definitely make a return trip to the Echo soon!  We would have sat outside but unfortunately it was raining good when we arrived."}
{"text":"I was less impressed with the service here than I had been last time also. We sat at the bar at 7 yesterday night, but ordered food - Maybe the bartender was just prioritizing people who would give him tons of tips over us. :P

-Good cheese curds!
-Good grilled chicken sandwich.
-I ordered \"chips\" as a side for the sandwich and ended up getting a little 140 calorie 75-cent vending machine baggie of off-brand Ruffles. ;O"}
{"text":"Fun and chill place to come hangout and watch the game. Staff are fun and friendly. 

They have a decent list of in tap beers, nothing special but feels like more than the average sports bar. They also host trivia on Thursday and sundays, hosts are always great!

Food can be good or average, but I'm not expecting fancy stuff for it being a sports bar. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was going to stay home and rearrange my sock drawer but I decided to grab a beer and pizza at the echo.  Made the right choice. The crust is thin and crispy and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"8/4/13 My wife and I stopped in and sat on the patio.  We enjoyed a 12\" build your own pizza, Greek salad, and a few beers.  After eating we went upstairs and played a quick game of Cricket.  This isn't the Echo I remembered from my youth and was glad for it.  I'm not sure when they remodeled, but I was impressed by their reinvention.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Echo Tap & Grill doesn't really stand out from the other pubs around Madison, but it doesn't have to.

With cheap drinks, delicious food and trivia nights, Echo Tap & Grill is a more casual option for fans of sport bars. 

The service was efficient and fast, and the place wasn't overly loud or crowded.

We got a few pitchers of Spotted Cow, a pepperoni and sausage pizza and an order of cheese curds to share.

The pizza was great, with its warm, melted cheese fused with the chunks of meat, and a crispy crust with a satisfying crunch.

The cheese curds were just ok for me, as I would have liked it to be more tender and for the cheese more melted. 

Echo Tap, while nothing groundbreaking, does a great job doing just that: being a typical Madison pub."}
{"text":"I've only really ordered Mostly your standard pub fare with some good qualities to it, try the specials for a bit of an adventure! They deliver too so that is really nice if you're craving a burger."}
{"text":"I can always count on Echo Tap for a good meal and beer when I visit Madison.  I use to go here with coworkers during a summer internship.  It has changed a bunch since the last time I was here.  More TVs playing multiple sportsball games, more items on the menu, and they have outdoor seating.  

I got myself the Deluxe Grilled Cheese, which is just a grilled cheese with onions, tomatoes, and guac. YUM! That definitely hit the spot.  The chili also caught my eye. It was good, but a little spicy for me, which means it's fine for any normal person.  That took me a little while to finish.  After living in Green Bay for several years, I've realized how much I like noodles in my chili (it's a Northeastern, WI thing)...kind of missed it while eating my chili.  

Two thumbs up for the beer selection here.  All really good craft beers on tap.  I'm jealous that Madison bars are more likely to have Lake Louie on tap.  I enjoyed a wonderful Warped Speed scotch ale. (gulp)  AHH!"}
{"text":"The Echo can be a bit Sketch-o at times, depending on the time of night and the clients, but it's a pretty fun place.  The darts are fun and they have tasty bar burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Great bar!

But the food here stinks. Nothing I hate more than being severed cold fries."}
{"text":"Great local place - they've redone the outside patio area, and it's really pretty now with all sorts of flowers and lots of tables.  Great place to go on a summer evening for a beer.  I also like their cheese curds.

There is a juke box where you can pay to request music - a few times I've paid my dollar, only to wait 45 minutes for the song to come on.  That would be my only critique of this place."}
{"text":"Very average food, typical burgers and sandwiches, nothing very special but there are sometimes cheap drink specials. I only come here for trivia."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a blast! Laid back environment (jeopardy games, knitting, etc.) with great food at a low price. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, especially Olivia! 
Definitely recommend the cheese sticks and the spinach and goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"I just ordered a simple cheeseburger and fries which I've done before to be delivered. This was the worst! I paid 12.00 bucks for a patty that was just that. A Patty with a piece of cheese. Oh and soggy fries. No lettuce, no nothing. Oh a bag of ketchup & mustard packets. I'm so sick of getting ripped off on delivery!  Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Echo tap and grill is a loud bar with a lot of televisions playing sports games on the walls. All in all it's fairly ordinary, very loud, and  has a poor layout on the interior. However, they have food and the prices for liquor and beer are quite fair.

This place is a drinker's tavern, similar to what you would find on the south side of Chicago but brighter and cleaner inside. There may be some yuppies and college kids around, but note those old horses at the bar -- they're the real ones who have likely been occupying that stool longer than you've been alive.

Recommended if you're ducking your AA meeting. Otherwise, you may wish to drink at your own risk."}
{"text":"Good bar food and great not hour from 4-6 it's half off appetizers! They're pita bread is amazing! And their cheese curds are good too"}
{"text":"Things the Echo Tap does well:
Patio: A beautifully maintained space with lots of flowers, TVs, and nice tables with umbrellas. 

Pizza: creative options, very delicious 

Beer: nice selection on tap 

The downside?
Prices: a little steep for what they're offering (i.e. $7.50 for average frozen cheese curds)"}
{"text":"For a sports bar with the usual bar fare, Echo Tap is real good. Their burger really is among the best in town, as is their walnut burger. But what I really want to talk about in this post are the pickles. 
Admittedly, the flavor is not awesome. But the crunch on these pickles- wow! It's the crunchiest pickle you'll ever have, and just think to yourself for a minute how satisfying that is?! Due to mediocre flavor, the pickle experience ranks only a 7/10, but the crunch is really worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Was impressed with their delivery! It's hard to have good fries when they're delivered to you, but these were great. Plus the Echo Burger is amazing -- cheesy, a great mix of burger and brat flavors, and the onions really help bring it all together. Yum.
Was also really happy because they tossed in some candy with my delivery -- guessing it was a Halloween special thing and not something they do all the time, but was just a great little extra thing! :)
Definitely will be going there to enjoy some drinks and more food soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before Badger BB game and during a Badger FB game,cuz it was in Mad City cocktail book.

Two stories, darts/pool, nice variety of \"working man's beer,\" decent jukebox, interesting crowd, and good atmosphere. Feels like you are in the middle of wisco..."}
{"text":"Nice clean bar with an obvious neighborhood following. Food service is friendly and fast. The cheeseburger lacked real beef flavor and the fries had a fish essence to the oil. I would not order either on a repeat visit. The parking is pretty good for a place so close to the congested downtown."}
{"text":"Went here specifically to get cheese curds as they reported the 'best cheese curds in town'.

Very disappointed. Caught the summer lunch crowd. They beer selection was sophomoric, the cheese curds were pre-packaged and over-fried, and the food was cheap (both in expense and taste). 

If you want the best cheese curds in Madison... don't go here."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing, managers (top) down. I often enjoy amicable, friendly, and quick service here.

I highly recommend the Echo Tuscan pizza, Jace's White Pizza, Aristotle's Dilemma (pizza), The Spinach and got cheese salad, The chicken fingers (toss them in buffalo sauce) and of course the beer!

Cheese Curds here are great as well!

Hidden treasures: You gotta try their desserts! The Doughnut Bites and the Cheesecake are Grade A-1!

Very small Private parking lot

ONE OF THE BEST BEER GARDEN/PATIOS IN TOWN! GREAT HEATERS FOR USE INTO OCT/NOV FOR FOOTBALL GAMES"}
{"text":"Due to closeness, I'm almost a regular at the Echo.  I usually have a low tolerance for sports bars, but i've managed to grow fond of the Echo Tap.  Maybe part of it is because its location isn't that close to Camp Randall, so they don't get as high of volume of drunken fans that are hanging out before/after the game, but it's still in the downtown area, so it doesn't attract very many townies either.    So, in regards to the crowd there, it's a good mix of college kids/young professionals/middle aged people.  It's a variety that I enjoy.

Food wise, it's solid for the most part.  Some of their dishes are hits, such as the Tofu Walnut Burger, or the Aristotle's Dilemma Pizza.  I've had a few things that I would only call okay though, like the deluxe grilled cheese, or the nacho plate.  So, I usually just stick with only a few of the items.  They're one of the more vegetarian friendly sports bars, so if that's a need you have (Like I do), then this spot will definitely serve a need for you.

The drink selection is also fine.  There's at least one of every major beer type there, and most of them are from Wisconsin.  I believe there's about 20 taps available, and there's also more choices in bottles if you're feeling more adventurous.  They do some cocktails as well, but it's mostly just the standards that you're used to, and it isn't too adventurous.  They don't carry much (if any) top shelf liquor, so don't expect the cocktails to be too fancy or amazing.

Overall, I enjoy the Echo Tap, and it's usually one of my first choices for a place to go watch the game at with the bros.  Like I said, I have a really low tolerance for sports bars, so just the fact that I can say that I kinda like this place says a lot in comparison to the rest.  Also, it's fun to do trivia here on occasion, so it's a good place to hit up on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and find that it's a nice corner bar but the service is hit or miss ranging from good to abysmal. Not that anyone is rude; they're simply overwhelmed and understaffed at times. 

Good bar food, good beer, cozy place. Wish I could give them a better rating."}
{"text":"I want to give the Echo Tap a 4, but I'm just not quite there.

When it's not completely overloaded with obnoxious ticket holders for Kohl Center sporting events, it's a 4-4.5 star bar.  Unfortunately, it's teeming with the aforementioned too frequently for my liking.  It's not just the typical d-bags, either--there are older, holier-than-thou types who are especially rude.

Anyway.  When the Echo Tap is not crowded, it's so great.  There are lots of tables, a *kickass* jukebox, friendly bar staff, non-frightening bathrooms, an upstairs and downstairs, a great selection of beers on tap, and delicious food.  I've yet to try the Echo Burger (a beef patty AND brat patty), but I hear you can go into congestive heart failure by just looking at it.  Also, if you drink there often enough, you can get a \"PBR Priority Card\" in which you're always entitled to PBR drink specials.  Now that's just plain spectacular."}
{"text":"There are many reasons why more than a few consider this the best all around joint downtown. I'll only bore you with 3 of them:

1. Best Bartenders in town. 
2. Best Bar food (along with Dotty's)
3. Best thin crust pizza. Period."}
{"text":"Went to the Echo for Packer Game Day this week - excellent experience

Service:  great.  Quick and efficient

Food:  The chili is OUTSTANDING.  They use chunks of beef vs. ground beef.  It is spicy.  The beans were cook right...not too hard and not too mushy.  I would come back for the chili alone

Bar:  I am purely a beer drinker and there selection was great.  Also the server gave me samples when requested as they had several, several tap selections that I had never had.

Atmosphere:  Wonderful game day atmosphere;  It was a lot of fun!  Everyone was friendly.  Obviously the Packers dominated the bar, but other games and other fans were there as well.

I am definitely going back - I want to try a pizza!!!"}
{"text":"One upon a time, this was a 5 star place in my book. Good bar food, cheap beer and a huge selection. Over the past two years, the owners have tried to make this a restaurant with a bar instead of a bar that serves food. As a result, the menu is better, but the service is very slow. A half hour to get a burger? Also, beer prices have skyrocketed. I should not have to pay $10.50 for a pitcher of Miller Lite. Tip...you are not an exclusive bar that can get away with charging that much for beer! I don't know another place that charges that much for a pitcher of macrobrew water. The Tap gets 3 stars because the food tastes pretty good, but I won't be drinking there in the future."}
{"text":"I diggit!!! Echo tap is a fun hangout spot with quite good food n drinks! The bloody mary is rich and delish, and it comes with a good sized pickle spear and a beer chase. The pizza is pretty guuud, it actually tasted better than it looked/than I thought it would. We tried the mediterranean one with feta, and it was ALSO rich and delish! I had the same server the two times I've been, and she was wonderful. If you're going to watch a game, get there early for good seats."}
{"text":"Each time I've eaten here I've tried to order something different, and each time the meal is fantastic. From the chicken sandwiches, to appetizers, burgers, pizza etc. It's always been a great meal, and a good atmosphere. They are pretty quick with pick-up orders as well."}
{"text":"I have ordered the grilled chicken sandwich the last four times I've been there, and I'm still amazed at how delicious it is. Another favorite is the buffalo chicken sandwich. Of course, they're known for their calzones, so they don't even need mentioning. Surprisingly, their salads are quite good as well--I personally love the spinach/walnut/goat cheese. 

They have a wide variety of beers on tap, and if you check into FourSquare 5 times, it's free!

The service is usually good, and the food is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Listen to this. I'm not one to give bad reviews and I genuinely don't want to hurt anyone's business. But it was Mifflin. I was hungry. I needed sustenance. We stopped in here in search of a burger. I ordered a double cheeseburger, medium rare, craving tender meat. The wait was not too long. The waiter was great. He brings out the double burger. It's slopped onto the basket and the cheese is sliding off. I lift the cheese up to see a huge patch of raw meat. Clearly inedible. I show the waiter and he immediately looked disgusted...he said, and I quote, \"oh shit.\" He continued to mutter as he carried the raw dish away. He returned with a burger that wasn't the medium rare that I ordered, but at least was cooked. 
The best is yet to come. He proceeded to offer us a free piece of chocolate cake in exchange for the horrible mistake of a raw burger that was served to me. We vehemently agreed to the cake. He brought it to the table and we dug in. I rotated the plate and looked at the side of the cake. I immediately questioned if what I was looking at was little spots of mold. We looked closer and identified white, fuzzy mold on the side of the cake. Their means of justifying the raw meat ended up being a health code disaster as well. But I didn't have the heart to mention it to the waiter. He was really great and still deserved a tip. Which is why I'm giving this place a decent review still despite the two monstrosities served to me. 3/5 might return if it's Mifflin and I'm hungry."}
{"text":"The Echo's remodel made the place roomier and brighter. There's a great selection of beers, and you must absolutely try the Echo Burger, a pagaent of beef and bratwurst goodness that will challange your coronary arteries. The staff is friendly even though they're always in a hurry."}
{"text":"Real people go here.  The more you go the better it gets.

Upstairs is as cool as a treehouse."}
{"text":"Overall solid bar and restaurant for what it is, a neighborhood bar. 

Patio is awesome in the warmer months and during a game day this placeb is awesome! They'll do free shots or drink specials during Wisconsin games. They also have a extremely crowded Thursday trivia; so make sure to get their early toob get a seat. 

Most of the first is alright; my favorite is their pizza. There are lots of good specialty pies."}
{"text":"I was craving cheese curds and this was the only place on GrubHub that was open at 11PM on a Monday night. The coupon I had made me spend a certain amount so I decided to tack on sweet potato fries and onion rings. After I placed my order online I got a notification that my pickup order was pushed back ten minutes. No biggie. I get an alert during the original time frame saying my food was ready. Should have also not been a big deal. Unfortunately my food was pretty soggy by the time I got over there and brought it home. The taste wasn't bad, but I'm not a fan of soggy food. I wouldn't recommend pick up orders. I suspect that the food is good when you're in the restaurant. I'm not sure if the cheese curds are worth the $7, though. You do get more than most places tend to give, but they're pretty average."}
{"text":"Cant really call it divey since they remodled but it's retained the same neighborhood feel as before only with more tvs and  better lighting . food is good - lunch specials and the basics with a few tweaks are always just right . service is on point and prices  don't hurt - only neg  can be parking but hey, it's downtown."}
{"text":"This is a very polarized review, because this place has some really amazing and non-amazing features, all in one.

4 Stars for the patio- When the Terrace is too crowded, this is a great second option for enjoying a beautiful evening. It's a big space, not too packed with tables and twinkle lights for that extra mood. Perfect.

2 stars for the food- The food is not strong. They do have it and it is edible. May be just eat before you come and focus on enjoying the patio with a lovely adult beverage. 

Overall, I would totally come back and would recommend this place, but with some caveats."}
{"text":"good old fashioned dive bar with great food and lots of tv's on the wall.  pool tables and darts upstairs and it's also a great spot to pregame if you're going to a basketball/hockey game at the Kohl center."}
{"text":"Going to keep it short and sweet:
Plenty of TV's
Outdoor beer garden seating (with TV's outside)
Divey-ish atmosphere inside
GREAT craft beer selection
Food is above average for this type of establishment
Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"A pretty average pub with a wonderful outdoor seating area. There are some pretty powerful heaters for when it is colder and it is a nice place to enjoy a beer on a summer night. 
I've only had the food once. I was with a larger group and everyone was happy with the food, they were all also a little drunk at the time. I was all about my food, I can't remember what it was called but it was a burger and brat patty sandwich. 
They also have to go food options if you are on the move."}
{"text":"All of us got a craving for pizza on a Sunday night and decided to come here. To say it hit the spot is an understatement. 

We sat outside on the patio and ordered some beer off the great list. Then I switched to wine. I was done with beer by this point in the trip. 

The pizza was amazing! I think we were all shocked at how good it was! I really wish I could remember our servers name. She was so awesome! Don't be fooled by the exterior of the place. Amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"I started coming here years ago to watch Badger games, and it's turned into one of my favorite local haunts. If you are looking for fun with no frills, look no further. The food is quintessential bar and very good. Where else but Wisconsin can you get a side of cheese curds with every meal? Great seasonal tap list, and I've had an excellent Bloody Mary or ten here ;) Don't miss out on the patio in summer!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer, darts, and creepy guys...what more could you ask for?!?!?!

Echo Tap is fun, but definitely not near the top of my list as far as Madison bars go.  The bartenders and staff have always been really nice when I've gone."}
{"text":"The patio has a nice atmosphere. The food was typical bar fare. Nice selection of tap beer. I would come again but not be that excited about it."}
{"text":"If you read any of my other reviews, you'll note that I don't give bad ones lightly. I just don't feel the \"OMG, the ECHO!\" feeling for this place that some do. I never frequented this place when I lived in Madison, but I went to the Echo on Saturday with some friends who did. 

The Echo Tap smelled like butt cheeks. It really and truly did. I thank my lucky stars that I had forgotten to close my tab at the last bar so I had an excuse to dip out and meet up with them at the next stop.

If this dive didn't smell, it would have been a perfectly acceptable Wisconsin townie bar, but it did and I just can't recommend it (unless you have a cold)."}
{"text":"I used to order from Echo Tap frequently in the last year or two. However, after my last encounter with the restaurant, I will never go there again. I think it was approximately Spring 2017 when I ordered through EatStreet late night on a Friday. I never had issues with ordering before. This time was different; I waited two hours for my food, called the restaurant asking about my order and I was treated so poorly by the staff. The first time I called, I was put on hold for 10 minutes and eventually someone hung up on me. The second time I called, I eventually got through to the manager on duty at the time. I explained the situation: my food was incredibly late and I wanted to know when I could expect it. The manager did not seem to care that I had been waiting so long, that I was frustrated and that I requested the meal be comped. When I explained everything to him, he said, \"Okay, what do you want me to do about it?\" As if it wasn't clear to him. I explained again and he said the same thing nonchalantly. Clearly customer service isn't a priority for Echo Tap. So I called EatStreet and cancelled the order. The food ended up arriving 3 hours past the original delivery time. But by that time, I had already eaten and the food was cold. I will never go back to Echo Tap again and I've told my friends and family about my experience as well."}
{"text":"Late night eating session!! Woo! (grr at Fried and Fabulous for being closed)
Our friend was telling us how the calzones were the size of a keyboard and how great they were. I am in fact  a fan of  Calzones but this friend also recommended Curry In The Box and that place was awful.

We ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and a calzone. The sandwich was pretty basic, the fries were great, and the calzone was huge. The calzone's size is made up mostly crust and it isn't flavorful. The chicken was pale, ugly, white cubes."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game with TVs galore. Friendly bartenders and a decent patio space. We were there for a Packers game which wasn't overly busy. I will definitely go back for some Badgers action and to try their wings."}
{"text":"A convenient neighborhood bar. There was a time when I might've given Echo Tap 4 stars as it does have some redeeming qualities. But alas, at this point I've tried too many items off the menu to give the food the benefit of the doubt.

Pros:
*Awesome patio for the warmer months! It looks like you're eating in a garden. Great place to enjoy drinks on a nice day.
*Trivia on Thursdays 
*Happy hour 4-7 during the week includes half priced appetizers
*Quick service 
*Cheese curds are actually very impressive!

Cons:
Most of the food is just not that good. The nachos, spinach artichoke dip, salads and soups are all mediocre. The chicken sandwich I ordered was honestly kind of inedible it was so gross. I have heard good things about the pizza, though, so maybe I will try it.

So...go for drinks, skip the food!"}
{"text":"Delivery was extremely fast (ordered at 3 and they were here at 3:20) and meal was still warm! I got the plain chicken sandwich and it's delicious. Also, I Loved the candy that came with it!"}
{"text":"My first dinner back in Madison, and it did not disappoint! 

At 8PM on a Wednesday night, there were still quite a few table filled outside on the patio. My friend and I chose a table facing one of the suspended flat screens and had a great time catching up and enjoying the warm weather. 

I ordered the Echo chicken sandwich (sans mayo) with a house salad on the side. The salad was a nice starter - cold and refreshing, but the real star of the meal was the sandwich. I was a huuggggee fan of the flatbread! 

Two days later, we were back for dinner, and this time my friend and I split a 14\" chicken pizza. I liked that we had the option to go with a thin crust, a thick crust, or their 'thickest crust' - it's good to know that they make their pizza per order! Anyway, we decided to go with the thickest crust and ended up with a whole lot of leftovers.  

Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza because it was a little too cheesy for my taste - blasphemous, I know! (To think I somehow lived in the ol' dairy state for a whole year... ) I actually preferred the pizza cold and the cheese a little more congealed, which was how I had it for breakfast the next morning.

Echo is a little out of the way for typical State Street bar-hoppers, but I think it does a great job servicing the residential area in its vicinity and offers a nice change of scenery."}
{"text":"Echo Tap is where you want to be before a UW Hockey game.  It gets packed for home games and has a lot of nostalgia in the bar as it celebrates the most successful Badger Athletic program ever."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go through the Yelp app for the first time and it was pretty slick!  I wasn't far away when I ordered and it didn't take long to park but they almost had my order ready when arrived (even though the wait time was listed as longer).  The staff were polite and efficient.  The food survived the trip home well--mini corn dogs for a little man and a spinach and goat cheese salad with chicken.  It was all surprisingly good for bar food and statifying.  
I've also gone for a drink ages ago but the atmosphere hasn't changed much since I was there.  There are quite a few tv's if you'd like to watch a sporting event.  It is casual and a great place to settle into for awhile to have a few drinks and relax with friends."}
{"text":"Don't let the dull outside of this place fool you. I went in on a Tuesday night and there was a light crowd. The barkeep was very nice and responsive. 

I ordered a pizza and it was fantastic! Not only did it taste good, it was good to the pocket book as well.

Over all this place is a great little dive (just because it is a dive doesn't mean it has to be dirty and run down). Next time I am back in town I would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"During the summer Echo has awesome outdoor seating on its patio - there are even TVs out there so you can catch whatever game you want to watch.

The food is good bar food fare and the staff are all welcoming. 

I personally tend to avoid it after 9pm when the students are in town- but during the summer it is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood to have a vodka lemonade outside."}
{"text":"The best bar in Madison hands down.  The staff is the best and everyone knows who you are and what they are doing.  There food is great and their prices are unbeatable, especially during Badger game days.  This is a place that everyone needs to stop at least once while living in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been to Echo Tap & Grill on numerous occasions and I have always had a positive experience. In the summer, they have a large outdoor patio. In the winter, they have a tent that surrounds the patio and there are overhead heater lamps which keep it comfortable. There is a very small parking lot, but lots of 2 hour parking in the surrounding streets. The Echo has levels, with TV's and seating on both levels. The bar is on the first level with lots of TV's and seating. The second level is where the darts and pool tables are placed, surrounded by a couple more tables. The waiters and bar staff are very friendly. There is a large beer selection and the food is typical of sports bar food. The cheese curds are great (a must have for a Wisconsin bar!). This place can be packed before Kohl Center sporting events, so get here early!"}
{"text":"Updating my review after multiple visits with good food and even better service. In addition, Echo recently expanded their patio hours and came to a neighborhood meeting. Does it get more Wisconsin than that? I think not.

Conveniently located on my block, and a fun place to grab casual food and drinks.

Definitely one of my favorite trivia spots to hit up; I'm almost a regular for the Thursday night crowd. It does get pretty crazy on trivia nights, so get there early if you want a seat.

The food is typical pub fare: burgers, pizza, and calzones. They have a pretty tasty tofu burger and spinach salad for the veggies, which is something I always appreciate.

Drinks are typical of a college bar: lots of beer options and standard mixed drinks. Every now and then they'll have specials, but it's not one of their strong points, so I'd like to see more of those.

Game days are especially fun at Echo. Most times, they give shots for Wisconsin touchdowns and Echo bucks out (think Monopoly money that you can use to pay for your food).

Stop by if you're in the mood to experience some Wisconsin fun and tasty pub fare."}
{"text":"The customer service at this place terrible. They told us to wait outside when they were at capacity, which is fair. But 18 people (we counted) left and they still wouldn't let us in. We asked they \"bouncer\" what the deal was and why they weren't doing a one in one out situation, and he said he didn't know and didn't attempt to find out. We asked him to find out but he kept refusing. We had to call the bar from in the line to get a manager out to give us some info. He comes outside and says they are at capacity. We ask when he will start letting people in and he said he didn't know and that they were closed, which made no sense. And this was all being said while there were multiple empty tables visible through the windows. Needless to say, a bar that is run by people who don't know what is going on isn't a place I am going to spend money."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but I thought it was pretty decent. I really liked the outdoor patio. There's a tv out there, so I enjoyed watching the US Open while eating.

I came here for lunch on a Thursday. They have a 5 tacos for $5 deal on Thursdays. It's not on the menu, nor on their specials menu. They're hard shell tacos with ground beef and cheese and lettuce. It comes with salsa. Guacamole is an extra 50 cents, though I'm not sure why. I'm fairly certain it's packaged pre-made guac. I didn't really sell the tacos that well, huh... Well, like I said, it's ridiculously cheap, and it's cheaper than Taco Bell at that point, so I hold these tacos to the same standards as those at Taco Bell. I was very full, so it was money well spent.

The other food here looks really good if that's of any consolation! I've heard good things about their menu; I just haven't tried it myself, so I may do that the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"The Echo has since been remodeled and I believe under new management, so the divey feel is more a thing of the past, but you still have your regulars who stuck around. 
If Trey is your bartender, (he's probably sporting a goatee, a bowling shirt, and a baseball hat) treat him right and buy him a shot of jagermeister. He remembers the good ole days"}
{"text":"We would give it a million stars..awesome food and brews..and the service warmed up and gave us some great recommendations for hot spots"}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar food. They fry their stuff well. Pizzas not too great, a bit soggy for my taste but they've got good toppings. Echo chicken is the one is recommend the most. They've trivia too, which is ok."}
{"text":"I really like Echo Tap.  They have a good beer selection and really good bar food.  (I highly recommend the cheese curds.) There is a good view of a TV no matter where you are, so it's a good place to hang out and watch the game.

During badger football season, Echo Tap has a free shuttle to Camp Randall. The first shuttle leaves an hour before the game, and another shuttle leaves 30 minutes before the game.  

If you're going to an event at the Kohl Center, Echo Tap is a great place to go before or after since it's within walking distance.

In the summer, the outdoor patio is a really nice place to spend some time.

Thursday night trivia is always fun too.


My only complaint about Echo Tap is that they often list specials on their website that they are not actually having. On multiple occasions, their website has listed breakfast specials on Badger game days with the date and the special, but they do not actually serve breakfast on Saturdays during football season. I find this very frustrating because I don't really want to eat pizza for breakfast, so I would have eaten before arriving at the bar.  If your website says you are serving breakfast, people expect breakfast. Staff should manage customer expectations by making sure the website reflects what the bar is serving, so customers aren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a great bar whether you come for a game, beer, or food. Take out is just as great. Both the upstairs and patio rock when you can get a seat.

Highly highly recommend the calzone to anyone and evrryone, it easily serves two people!"}
