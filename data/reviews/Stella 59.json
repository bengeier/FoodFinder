{"text":"My first impression was that the place was having an identity crisis, like a Pizza Hut meets Olive and Ivy.  The restaurant is described as elegant casual, but I feel like they some how missed the mark....  Pros:  good beer selection, good ambiance at the bar, servers were par (the pizza of at a different table looked good)  Cons: Food, price For a started we ordered the Fire Chips.  Not bad, but small portion for the price.  Some of the chips were rather soggy, so they probably didn't have their fryer hot enough. My husband ordered a calzone.  The crust was the texture of a \"wet paper towel\", the meat was tasteless and greasy. I ordered the Sweet Gorgonzola Pear Salad with Mixed Greens and added grilled chicken.  The pears were canned!! (seriously folks, is the elementary school cafeteria?)  The salad was soggy, the \"mixed greens\" were mostly romaine...and the chicken was also oily and lacking flavor.   The bill for 2 entrees, 2 drinks and an appetizer was about $55 after tip, which would have been okay if the quality had been better.  With the well established (and frankly much better) Italian themed Babbo's, Betty's Nosh and Tagliani's all with in a 5 mile radius, Stella Rossa 59 will have to up their game to stay in business!"}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch..not bad for west valley. Staff is a 5 stars. Portions are about right for the price. I will be coming back again for lunch..better than fast food :)"}
{"text":"I liked this place so much better when it was Bravi.  Atmosphere was nicer, food was better.  Got a pizza paid $14, it was so soggy and tasted like mush.  Had the minestrone soup- boring, Ceaser salad - way to much dressing and that was the cream style, :( .   The new look is cold and stark and has no real ambiance.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was fabulous but the food was not.  As other reviewers stated, it is very bland.  The pizza and calzone others in our party ordered was burnt on the bottom.  Granted management was kind enough to have another made, that meant waiting....again.....for the food to come out.  A ok place to stop for a beer, but with Babbos a couple of miles away, drive the extra for some really good food!"}
{"text":"Was there for dinner last night. Pretty quiet. Server seemed very inexperienced. Had to ask for everything that should be common knowledge for a semi-experienced server. Had the sausage stuffed mushroom app...was good but swimming in the tomato cream sauce. Less sauce would be good and bread points or bread sticks to sop up the leftover sauce would be a good addition. Actually, bread on the table like most italian restaurants included would be great. I ordered some at an additional cost. I got the italian chopped salad, dressing on the side. Had to send it back because it came with dressing on it. Think the kitchen got angry and let me know by leaving the pepperocinis and cherry tomatoes off and throwing mozzarella on instead of grated parmesan. Salad greens aren't cleaned enough as many bites were gritty. My partner got the bruschetta pizza which was good if a bit pricey. Table coverings seem to be the perfect thing for harboring bacteria, they may want to rethink those."}
{"text":"We had lunch here, and had mixed reviews.  The tomato soup was fabulous with a rich tomato cream base and tiny pieces of tomato throughout.  The Italian chopped salad was mostly lettuce with tiny squares of  chopped salami, about 4 halved cherry tomatoes, a few capers, and lots of romaine; no garbanzos or pepperoncini as the menu described.  It was nothing special and I would not order it again.  The calzone, however looked good and my dining partner said it was good with enough to take home for another lunch.  The pizza (12\") and chicken artichoke panini likewise were reported to be good.  The restaurant is small and very contemporary.  There is seating both outside and inside, and tables at the back that can be set for groups."}
{"text":"The best service I've ever had at a restaurant and the best calzone I've ever had. It was quiet and our waiter was very attentive. Definitely coming back for more. Probably this weekend.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to hang out. The staff is always friendly and the bartender Mike always remembers my boyfriend and I. They have an excellent selection of beer and a full bar. During the cooler months they open the garage style doors so open air comes through and you can sit outside or inside facing the middle of the bar. Their happy hour menu is to die for! Make sure you try their wings and the bruschetta, yummy! They also have a great lunch special which includes a personal size pizza and your choice of salad. My boyfriend and I have been there several times on different days/times and have always received excellent service. We will definitely continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just went for some wine, apps and some quality time together.  This was the perfect place."}
{"text":"I really liked this place Dayna and Robert were great....but then....I heard it was sold. Not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has only become better with the current owners.  The service seems to be improving and typically we go to this particular restaurant on Friday nights.  Overall I am impressed with the improvements and look forward to more meals at Stella Rosa 59!  We typically ask for our pizza \"extra\" crispy and they are spot on every time, Never even close to burned....."}
{"text":"I was excited to try some place new for my birthday especially since it was nearby in the west valley, however the excitement quickly disappeared after the appetizer came.  We overheard a waitress tell some people that this place used to be called Bravi Tuscan Kitchen and they didn't change the menu.  TOO BAD they should have!!! Everything I ordered was bland and simply just not good.  The side of veggies I got looked like warmed up left over pizza toppings and I could microwave better chicken Parmesan at home.  The waitress was polite and kept are drinks full so that's a plus but I will not be returning.  Maybe check it out if you feel like socializing and drinks but skip it otherwise."}
{"text":"Stella Rossa 59 Kitchen is a small budget American Italian Style Restaurant with a bar and wait service. The decor is fresh and modern but the booth I sat at was not very comfortable. It was very close to the table and the fabric was like velcro and was hard to slide in. This restaurant used to be named Bravi Tuscan Kitchen.   I used to go here often years ago when it was Bravi when there were few other choices in town. We liked the decor, the location and the low prices but we stopped going because the food was always on the bland side.   We decided to go back and try lunch.  I had the $6.99 1/2 vegetable panini lunch special with salad. My panini was made with very fresh soft bread and had a minuscular amount of fresh vegetables that were oddly flavorless with a small amount of red sauce that also seemed unflavored. I added salt and pepper to the sandwich and it was better. My salad seemed fresh. It was like I just had a plain salad with a chunk of bread on the side. I don't think this is bad food it's just bland food.  My husband thought for $2 more he should have the whole panini and salad. His sandwich had more flavor from the sausage but he also thought the red sauce was unseasoned too.  Not bad food just bland food.   Some people do prefer bland food...(not me though)  A current grade \"A\" Maricopa Sign is posted"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The food, the atmosphere, the service...you can't beat it! Brianna was amazing, sets the bar for excellent service!"}
{"text":"Service was non existent.  Arrived at 5:00 on a Friday, not super busy, sat at table for 10 minutes plus...no service at all. My friends and I moved to the bar hoping to get a drink...again...10 minutes of watching one poor bartender service the entire restaurant while three servers stood around and chatted. Finally the poor bartender asked one of the servers to help us and we eventually got a drink. Was hoping for a new happy hour meeting place but this WILL NOT be it!  Train your employees!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Friday lunch and sat at the bar. Had a wonderful meal and the bartender was exactly. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"My family and I recently moved to the area and received a flyer in the mail so we decided to stop by for dinner. Initially the hostess came by our table a couple of times laughing so hard she was wiping tears from her eyes. It was a little weird, but everything else was incredible. The bartender was our waiter and he was spot on with service and replenishing our drinks. The menu had a good variety and had something for everyone in my family, which is not always the case when dining out. I can't say enough about he food as all of the dishes came out hot and delicious. It is rare when my family all wants to return to a restaurant and try the rest of the menu. It was clean and it looks like a great place for Sunday Football. I would recommend this restaurant and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"I posted the while menu and just so you know the pizzas are 12' unlike Jon B says it's not $15 for an 8' pizza. Best place for good food great service and to watch the cardinals play! side note yelp needs to stop taking all the good reviews down and leaving the negative this is a great place!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent not amazing but not worth the price tag IMO. I had the spinach ravioli and at $16 bucks I was hoping for a little more than just 6 small raviolis! The redeeming factor though is the staff super attentive and friendly.  The bartender even sent over a round of lemoncello shots to accompany my dessert knowing it was my birthday."}
{"text":"Waited for the dust to settle before trying this place out after the rebuild.  The food is about the same but prices seem to have gone up some.  The thing that turned me off was I asked for a little extra salad dressing and found when I got the bill I was charged $.50 for about one ounce of additional dressing.  If they feel they need to do this makes me wonder how many other things they add an additional charge for."}
{"text":"First time at Stella's 59. Had a dos Equis and gf had a mg no frozen available had to make do on the rocks she drank it so must have been good. She had bruschetta 4$ and she said it was very good. Adult atmosphere laid back and modern. Might return"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Nice friendly atmosphere. Was Bravi Resturant prior and it was ok, like Stella 59 better.  It seems to be under rated for the food quality, try the fettuccine with shrimp and blue cheese crumbles added."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for the first time from the suggestion of our daughter and her boyfriend.  We tend to always lean towards Mexican food places but, we thought it was time to get a little out of our rut. We did not get there until a little after eight on a Saturday night and were surprised by how empty the restaurant was. We were a little concerned that that was a reflection on the food or service or both. We sat at the bar which was outside seating and pleasant atmosphere. We were waited on immediately and were offered menu suggestions that we went with. My husband and I split the Mediterranean salad and the Chicken Piccata entree.  Both were delicious and filling!! Then to top of our experience, we discovered the outdoor patio seating is dog friendly-whoo hoo!!!    We will definitely be back and next time with our favorite little four legged child."}
{"text":"I was looking for Italian Cuisine.  This is an Italian sports bar with mediocre food and no real cuisine choices.  For a sports bar the appetizer list is the same old same, but limited.  It seems like the same menu from BRAVI Tuscan Kitchen, that use to be there and if that did not make, one would think they would spice up the menu. I was excited for something new and different and the name Stella Rossa 59 did not sound like a mediocre sports bar.  On a positive note our server was great.  My chicken capone dish was bland with left over dried out chicken so as a result will  will not return."}
{"text":"The worst!! Food is awful and the overcharged us. When I called to ask why the girl just said they hadn't updated the menu yet and she's take off the tip we have to \"even out the difference\". Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch.. Was greeted by a hostess and seated immediately .. I enjoyed a delicious portion of fettuccine Alfredo and my daughter had the house special calzone .. My fettuccine was served with a creamy white  sauce with the perfect amount of garlic flavor, it was served with a warm garlic bread...my daughter had a calzone that was filled with sausage , pepperoni , cheese and veggies ..,this also came with a bowl of marinara sauce .. These were both nice size portions .. The service here is friendly and quick , the restaurant is a nicely arranged and welcoming .. Great selection of pizza , pastas and other great Italian dishes.. This is a great place for lunch and dinner .. You cannot go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by when visiting from California. Saw beer taps through the window and had to stop. Super clean, good beer selection, very good service, very friendly. It's a new name for an old location I guess. 4 stars because the food could have been a LITTLE better. I got a panini with salad. Definitely stop by. Local beers are always a plus. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a 4.5...   Disclaimer: I know the owner.    I also know they put a TON of work and $$ into rebranding the business and today was my third visit and it was great.    I had the lunch special of small salad and 8\" pizza.  The House Salad was perfect size (perhaps needed a pinch of salt or some olives?).  I had the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and devoured it.  Sitting at the bar with great company looking at the great selection of libations.  Really liked it.  The staff was outgoing and friendly.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"First time here, there was quite a few people.  Ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, it was mediocre.  We also ordered caprese salad, it was terrible.  There was at least twice as many tomatoes as cheese and the tomatoes were hard as rocks.  I would have complained but we did not see much of our server after our food came.  She did not refill drinks or offer us a dessert menu, despite the fact that we were there a lengthy time.  Two beers, a pizza and a terrible salad came to $40.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've avoided this place for months based on the bad reviews on here, but we couldn't make up our minds tonight so landed here as its right down the road.  We loved it.  Great service and food at decent prices.  Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews.  I'm from NJ so am very picky about Italian food.  The baked ziti was great.. tasty, lots of cheese and a good portion.  My fiance got the wings and said they were the spiciest he's ever had.     We will definitely be back. Do not let the bad reviews sway you... obviously they just had to complain about something!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a few weeks....love it. Great sports bar atmosphere without being crazy loud. Indoor/outdoor bar a nice touch. Tried most items on menu from sandwiches to pasta and all have been very good (great wings!). Awesome beer choices. Hope this place stays around...great asset to the northwest side."}
{"text":"This was our fist time at this place. We live down the street so we thought we would try it. We waited 30 minutes to get a drink and after several reminders it finally came. Our waitress never came back after she dropped off our drinks to actually take our order. After 50 minutes we finally gave up and asked for our check. Once we got our check and I gave the waitress my card she walked around the place with my card for another 10 minutes. They were completely under staffed. I can't comment on the food because we never got a chance to order."}
