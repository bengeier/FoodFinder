{"text":"I love this place! My very favourite neighbourhood Mexican joint. Can't wait for the excellent patio to open again."}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida, con sabor a México.  Los burritos recomendables, muy bien servidos (porciones grandes) y sobre todo deliciosos. Los postres uffff geniales, churros, helado de aguacate y pastel de 3 leches. Una delicia!!!! El servicio muy bueno!!! Recomendable lugar, si vuelvo a comer ahí!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good, not great, food. Prices aren't cheap but also not expensive. Nothing special but the menu is authentic.   One star docked for being cash only and not having a working ATM. A member of our party was told to go around the corner to the BMO. Odd protocol and not very professional."}
{"text":"My dining parter and I had 6 tacos (all different), an order of chips and guac, along with a glass of red Sangria and a \"Jamaica\" margarita. Total came to $60+tip for quite a filling meal. Local beer selection is just about all Mill St. The interior is nicely renovated, quite spacious, but we sat in the back patio and it was perfect. Good service (although we were the only patrons at the time), but had full waters and both red and green salsas available for our tacos (and again for our chips). We liked the Sangria even more than Pour Boys a block over. The tacos were nicely sized, similar in size to La Carnita/Barrio Coreano and just as tasty in our opinion. Our favorites were the Barbacoa and Tinga, but the whole lot was tasty. Big helping of guac, but pretty sparse on the chips and salsas (maybe we could've asked for more). I'm really hoping this place sticks around. There are a few mexican/latin places in the area, like the venerable \"Tacos Al Asador\" but this place is pretty affordable for what comes out to $4 per taco, for something a bit different. For comparison, al pastor tacos at \"Tacos Al Asador\" are often pretty dry, but these ones are very saucy. Also, heads up, it's cash only at the moment, but about all banks are nearby on Bloor (including an RBC ATM in the 6 penny variety)."}
{"text":"Decent food but wildly overpriced for the quantity. $40 for two beers, chips and 3 small tacos. It's cash only. Nice patio, though."}
{"text":"A wonderfully quaint and intimate spot! Tucked away from Bloor street, Los Guacamoles provided us an out-of-Toronto experience from the ambiance, to the stellar service, to most importantly the food. We tried the beef burrito and a selection of their tacos. Everything was fresh and authentic. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"A friend came over for lunch a few weeks ago...so I suggested we walk down the street and try the restaurant.  While the sign said open that day at 11:30 they weren't.  So I suggested we go today for lunch...and I see they aren't open until 5.  It's summer lunch patio weather people!  I give up on the lunches."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Loved the corn. The food is slightly over priced for what it is. But, good authentic Mexican isn't easy to find. I'll be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Great 'hood place, very homey and friendly and great food. Authentic- real thing- not pretentious at all. Great back patio too. This will be our new go-to neighbourhood place! It's great!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a whim. Serves me right for being spontaneous and not listening to the reviews.  We had a really early dinner at 5pm. Thought maybe that's why there was no one inside. Finished 30mins later, took a walk around the corner and the mexican place around the corner was packed. Walked past Los Guac to get back to our car around 6 and there still wasn't anyone.  Food was ok. Flavours of tacos seemed a little off but not bad. Can't put my finger on it but it wasn't mmm good. Eg la carnitas is mmm good. Five lives in Kensington is mmm good. This was meh alright. The carnitas was really dry. The other 2 tacos had flavour but like I said it was a little off. Price was $12 for 3. It was ok but could get more/better for same price elsewhere.  I also felt a little tricked into paying for the rice and beans which I don't appreciate. I ordered the enchiladas... which typically come with rice and beans on the side at every other place I've had it. After I ordered the waiter point blank asked me if I wanted rice/beans, or a salad. His insistence made it sound like it was a choice of side, not an extra order.   He then took hubby's order of tacos and again asked if he wanted rice/beans, or salad. That's when we asked if it came as a side to his main because it was a little odd. He said no so we declined. At that point he should have recognized our confusion and clarified my order because there definitely was confusion during our exchange.  Food came out and there was no rice and beans on my plate. That's when I realized that we had ordered an extra side that I really didn't need nor necessarily want. Perhaps an honest mistake on his part, and not a huge deal but definitely didn't set a good tone to the dinner.  My enchiladas seemed lacking. I got the chicken. It was a tad dry but was smothered in sauce so it made up for it. Correct me if I'm wrong but inside an enchilada is there only supposed to be shredded chicken and sauce, nothing else? The whole thing didn't seem like a complete meal.   Most sit down Mexican places I've been to offer you complimentary salsa and chips when you sit down. Their meals are filling and satisfying and leave you wanting for nothing. This place felt like I was being nickled and dimed to put a complete lacklustre meal together...  Ambience was nice though.. so there's that."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats .. maybe going to restaurant better , not sure , but the food was really gross. Waste of 70 bucks .. threw most of it out and feel really gross and might vomit .. nasty  0 stars"}
{"text":"Went to Los Guaca-Moles for Mother's Day lunch today and it was fabulous! The service was second to none and then the food came in.  It was everything I hope for - a bit of crunch, a smidge of heat, and a healthy dose of citrus.I wanted a little more heat, and they came through with their home-made hot sauces. A touch of smoke made these quite delicious!  I expected at least a hint of cilantro, but that was not to be. No worries! It was a delightful meal and didn't cost a great deal.  The restaurant is a little off the beaten track, which would account for the low patronage. But if you're looking for a scrumptious dinner in lovely ambiance, go to Los Guaca-Moles!"}
{"text":"Clearly people saying \"it's amazing\" or \"I know my stuff cos' I lived in Mexico for years\" are out of their mind. Although the guac' is ok, it is small and comes with cheap tortilla chips (not house made). The ceviche tastes ok but looks like a soup and is probably made from frozen fish. Finally, what's a good mexican without a good margarita? Well - los Guacamoles take on Margarita is a $10 tequila mixed with an horrible and chemical PREMIX. And the queso fundido was bland!  Despite a friendly server and okay tacos (tortilla was dry), I won't come back.  No wonder the restaurant was half empty on a busy Sat night. Try it at your own risk!  PS: it was CASH or Visa Credit when we went, and fairly expensive for what we ate."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on Friday and had a really positive experience. We stopped in after an event and were looking for a yummy meal.  When you first walk in, you'll notice a Mexican flag covering the door and a long narrow area for guests to sit. Our waiter came over and seated us at a table. The restaurant was dimly lit and it created the perfect environment for a date night.   We asked our waiter which tacos he would recommend with my two food allergies (I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant) and he recommended we try La Tinga and El Nopal. We also ordered two Lime Margaritas.   La Tinga Taco La Tinga is a chicken taco served on a soft corn tortilla. We both found this taco a little bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour; we couldn't really taste the chipotle sauce, the red sauce or the flavour of the onions. (If you visit this restaurant I do not recommend you try this dish).   El Nopal Taco I was surprised the waiter suggested we try El Nopal taco. It is a vegetarian taco and I didn't expect it to be as good as La Tinga. To our surprise, El Nopal pushed La Tinga out of the water. El Nopal was absolutely fantastic! It is made with a corn tortilla, cactus strips marinated in a green tomatillo sauce, coriander and crispy tortilla bits.  This was my first time trying a cactus dish and I absolutely loved it! The tacos had a lot of flavour and the cactus flesh was the texture of a root vegetable. I honestly don't know how to explain the flavours of this dish but it is definitely something you need to try!  Lime Margaritas: We ordered two lime Margaritas and really enjoyed them. I was surprised they arrived on the rocks instead of as a slushy (I missed that memo in the menu) but it was prepared really well. The drinks has the perfect tart flavour and they were quite refreshing.  Would I Return to this restaurant??? Absolutely!!  I'd love to try some of their other tacos and I love how they can accommodate different food intolerances."}
{"text":"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead.   They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience.   We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.  Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I\"ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico.   There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out.   Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night."}
{"text":"Ok.  I have to admit - having lived in L.A. for 5 years has tainted my palate for authentic Mexican food. However, Los Guacamoles blew it out of the park.  Delicious, fresh, authentic fare - and well priced.   A nice surprise, because so many of these bandwagon 'taco' restaurants popping up around Toronto are generally mediocre at best, and the price for the tacos are insane.    The patio out back was killer, service was amazing and the food was amazing - even the house wine was pretty damn good.  The interior is eclectic, cozy yet modern - with amazing murals along the walls including my gal pal Frida Kahlo, of course!  Owned by Mexican restaurant vet Lizbeth Orea - formerly of Dos Amigos - she has really taken it to the next level.   When I'm in Toronto, this will be my go-to spot for fresh, authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"We had the chicken nachos which were fantastic.  Lot's of shredded chicken with tons of cheese and refried beans.  We then shared two tacos - the Poblanito and Pipianero.  Lot's of chicken in both with amazing flavours.  My boyfriend is 200 pounds and we were both very full.  We also had draft Dos Equis which is always a treat as many bars don't offer this beer on tap.   The servers are very friendly and polite.  I will definitely be back for more authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some tacos with a date. Asked the waitress to leave the dairy off the tacos and instead replace it with guacamole. Her answer was a flat out \"No,\" Ok, thanks!  Since my date was starving, we then ordered some taco's (without the dairy). Shortly before her food arrived I was told they didn't have the ingredients to make my vegetarian order and asked me if I wanted to try something different??? Seriously? What was she suggesting, exactly? Meat to a Vegan?  Instead, I sat there and watched my date eat her pathetically small, 5$ tacos.  The waitress then had the nerve to try and upsell me on drinks and ask me how things were, while I sat there and watched my date eat her dinner. How well could she possibly have thought things were going?  Horrible service, overpriced, unwelcoming and completely amateur."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim, and we were not disappointed. We ordered 3 tacos for two of us and enchiladas for the third.   For dessert we ordered the avocado helato in addition to the Dulce de Leche Helado. Both are amazing! It's a must get!   For drinks, we got a mojito, sangria and a Caesar (for myself). The ceasar was done really well! In the end they gave us a free round of a Mexican shot, which was super nice of them!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had on bloor so far. I tried the hibiscus taco and was blown away by how something so simple could have such a robust flavour. The service was great and the front patio is such a nice touch in the summer. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more off the menu!  My only complaint: they bring out the food so fast you're done your meal before you know it."}
{"text":"Brand New Mexican restaurant in Toronto! Feasted on tacos and chips and guacamole. Decent prices for Toronto. The restaurant just opened and the staff are super friendly. Pitchers of sangria $29 and a back patio will make this a great addition to the area. Food is fresh, tasty, flavours are well balanced and delicious  Tacos are 3 for $12. Appetizers and burritos as well. Great drinks selection"}
{"text":"one of the few places in Toronto that sell lengua (tongue) tacos.  I eat alot of lengua whenever I am California, Texas, Arizona or Nevada and I'd say their lengua was done very well.  good prices for the area, their street corn pops were very good and the atmosphere was casual.  I'm not a fan of the high end hipster treatment to some of the mexican places in Toronto and this place did not disappoint.    staff was nice and so was the owner, 'd definitely come back.  they're definitely authentic and they didn't have liver tacos when I was there but I can't wait to try it next time."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant, the enchiladas were good. The ice cream and dessert were better. Decent prices and service was fast. Nothing stood out to make it great."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Came with my coworker and sister. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was great! I had the corn pops, nacho chips with ceviche, guacamole, tacos, and their desserts!  All delicious. The waiter (Orlando) was really nice and attentive to us! Recommend this place. Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last year.  I avoided it at first assuming because of the name it was an Americanized version of Mexican food. When I tried it I quickly discovered that it served the best tacos in the city. The Poblanito, a Mole taco, is incredibly addictive and just one of the items I've ordered obsessively. See I go through a lot of taco phases. Where I only want one type and I keep finding a new favorite. I honestly think the Al Pastor is the best version of this taco in the city. Maybe in Canada. And I'm a huge Taco guy. Recently I have started getting the Al Pastor Torta and really don't want to eat anything else ever again. But the food isn't really the point of the review. They seriously value their customers. Yesterday they brought me the bill. I took out my money to pay for it and they said flip it over. And it said thanks for being a valued customer. And the owner told me that they had paid the entire bill. And said it meant a lot to them that I came as often as I do. I think you should start coming here. To experience a place that serves incredible food and treats their customers like gold."}
{"text":"Los Guaca-moles is heating up the hood. Start out with the elote (mexican corn - sweet, succulent and bathed in cheeses and spices that  are always a well kept secret.). Chicken chalupas are my personal favourite - hand crafted corn tortillas smothered in chicken, beans and salsa. Expect a mess. Use your hands here.  Home made ice creams- avocado and caramel...just as you think you are sugared out pop a churro in your mouth. No words. Good for families or date night. Tequilla, mojitos, sangria and margaritas as well as wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Lovely little place for dinner. We've now tried most of the menu and everything has been delicious. Nice mix of traditional Mexican style with some dishes I presume are more prevalent north of the border. Very reasonable prices and great service and the owners seem like really nice people.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best mexican dinners at this place. If you don't order their guacamole then that's a big life mistake. Do it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I try to come in for a visit every time I'm in the city! The service is quick, the food is amazing."}
