{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I have all my meetings here, food is excellent, gelato is insanely delicious. Staff and owners are very nice and always attentive. MUST GO THERE!"}
{"text":"I am a gelato aficionado who's had gelato in both Spain and Italy and I must say this gelato is so tasty and authentic. Reminds me of Italy. Stracciatella is my fave and theirs is creamy and chips were plentiful. My hubby got the coffee which he loved it had coffee bean chips. Will def be back when back in town."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here just once. The pizza was sort of...limp and kind of soggy. I did not try their gelato, but the pizza was terrible. I think the service was ok."}
{"text":"Love the G-Spot. I like gelato in general just cause I don't feel so bad when I start fiendin' for some chocolate. And The Gelato spot is as good as it gets. I like the variety of flavors they offer. And if you're wondering what it'll taste like, you can always get a sample. You can mix and match all the flavors as much as you want. I really like the snickers gelato flavor with some mint chocolate chip. Just writing this review makes me want to get some lol. I love this location; being on the corner and on Scottsdale Rd, it makes it perfect to sit and people watch. It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Creamy gelato with hefty servings of each scoop. Atmosphere was kind of like an old ice cream shop. Nice view of the main road of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was frankly blown away by how nice the people working here were. I'm used to the typical Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone employees who usually don't care if you have a good experience or not.

The Gelato Spot employees asked if we wanted samples and made good recommendations when asked about flavor pairings. They all provided energetic and smiling service. 

The gelato was excellent. I can't tell you whether it was good gelato or not but it sure tasted good to me. 

What also struck me was how clean the place was -especially on a busy Friday evening.

I'll be back again, most definitely."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My boyfriend and I love it, the Gelato is awesome it is hard to decide on which flavor.   It is the closest I have had to when I was in Italy.Love the gelato but their Italian coffees are great! I have their iced vanilla latte with soy and it is amazing and big!  I took a friend for coffee 15 min before they opened and the staff member was sooo nice said no problem made up the coffees and my friend proceeded to say \" I hate You this coffee is so good I wish I lived closer to get it instead of Starbucks\".  They added brick oven Pizza and it is very good, smaller than some pizzas but delicious ingredients.  It is very pretty inside and staff is very nice, it is my boyfriend and mine favorite treats. Thanks Gelato Spot :)"}
{"text":"Gelato gets 5 stars for being some of the best ice cream in town, the pizza gets 4 stars for being good quality but a bit thin on quantity."}
{"text":"The Gelato here is amazing - best in Old Town! Nice selection and you can get a latte to go along with your yummy treat."}
{"text":"To be honest with you, I have not actually had gelato from Gelato Spot. But, their espresso is to die for! It is so smooth and delightful. I live near Old Town and was looking for a morning coffee spot. The starbucks on Indian School & Scottsdale is far to stressful in the morning. My morning coffee is mean to be to relaxing, and an easy process. Not people shouting in parking lots,and impatient people in lines. So, I was at Gelato Spot studying ( it is ideal for that) and I noticed they open at 7 AM. Therefore, Gelato Spot is now my morning stop for coffee! Thank you GS for making me delicious coffee everymorning!"}
{"text":"AWFUL service!  The girls serving gelato had horrible attitudes and kept pushing me off to each other (they openly said they did not want to wait on me and told each other to just have me wait and to help someone else).  Their customer service sucked and on top of it, their gelato was nothing special.  You will never see me step a foot in this place again."}
{"text":"The lady who scooped my gelato, her name was Margo. She's really friendly and very professional! Will be back!! :)"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Pizza in town. Not the usual thick layers of fatty cheese but done northern Italian style, which is much crisper and thinner (and healthier). We didn't even know they do pizza. This place has been known for ice cream for so long. Check it out, we loved it so much we came back within a week."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Every time we go, everyone who works there is so genuinely friendly - it's always a nice experience.  

Amazing selection of gelatos and overall selection of other offerings, all in the same space.  Pluses: they actually have good selection of vegan gelatos - had the chocolate coconut milk, was D-Lish -- perfect/not too sweet!!  Love sitting in the glass front area overlooking the street, it's dimly lit, offering cute comfy pillows to lounge on where we could enjoy our sweet treats, as we watch the world go by... And have to mention - the bathrooms are some of the nicest facilities around-modern, attractive and ALWAYS clean... I note, in particular because it shows a commitment to detail and that the ownership/management takes pride in every aspect of their business!

Thank you, Gelato Spot - we look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. We walked in and were greeted nicely at the door. The girl serving the gelato was also very pleasant. Unfortunately  that's where the niceness ends. The gelato was completely tasteless and not gelato at all. Additionally as I was standing and eating my gelato I noticed a cockroach running around in front of me. Needless to say I put down my gelato and quickly exited the premises. Very disappointed. The only reason I gave one stars is because of the friendly staff. The place obviously has cleanliness issues. Management take notice."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato. The chocolate caramel fudge brownie satisfies the chocolate lover's craving."}
{"text":"Worst gelato I've had. The salted caramel tasted overly salty and no caramel flavor. The almond snickers had great potential but again, no flavor and more icy than I like. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We frequent the gelato spot a couple times a month and we're never let down. The American Pizza & White Pizza is my favorite. The crust is the best in town. Another fav is the Chicken Louie Salad. But you can't go wrong with any of their salads. Lastly, the Gelato is fantastic! I stick to my usual....Almond, salted caramel & Pokkket a Coffee!"}
{"text":"Truly the one true Mecca for gelato lovers in the world.  This restaurant has the most gelato flavors I have ever seen.   If you are in the state of Arizona make sure you go to this restaurant.  Drive all night if you have to."}
{"text":"I am a fan, definitely! Many is no object when it comes to a cold nice treat in 120 degrees heat. The seatings are great both inside and outside (watering mist++++) on the patio, parking is convenient or you could just stroll around the Old Town center's many shops and drop by to get a nice scoop or two of your favorite gelato flavors. And if you aren't feeling for gelato they have some Italian roast coffee to satisfy your caffeine blitz all day long!"}
{"text":"Walked in tonight with eight people four being children.  Place was packed yet Tommy seated us immediately. Normally this is a self service spot. Tommy took our order and served us amidst the hustle of the place. Great service.  Right on!  Gelato was great too!  Love the coconut!"}
{"text":"Had a panini and gelato while visiting Scottsdale for work. Good food, quick service, decent price."}
{"text":"The greatest pizza in Scottsdale hands down. As a bonus, they have better gelato than Italy itself! Service and food is a zenith of restaurants everywhere."}
{"text":"So good.  I think of all the other places around town for you to get ice cream and this is one of the first spots I pick (pun intended).  I think anyone that is near one should go.  

Not only is it a fun atmosphere but their ice cream is so sweet and so good that it hits the spot.  I cant help myself, I can make these puns all day, I have to stop by when I pass by it.

I will say the down side is the price, but if you are willing to spend your money on cold stone for the 4 dollars and some odd cents, go here its way better and a lot more chill.  

I have yet to try the coffee here, but I can only imagine that its as good as the ice cream.

Recommendations: To anyone that eats ice cream"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the ice cream isn't all that, I wouldn't recommend this place, stay away!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Gelato Spot many times in the past and never had a problem. However, my last trip to the Old Town location will be my last and inspired me to open a Yelp account. I ordered a two-scoop and quickly found what looked to be a beard hair in one of my flavors - GROSS. I showed the girl at the counter and she offered to give me a new one, but she did NOT remove the batch of that flavor from the case. I accepted her offer for two completely new flavors, and made it about halfway through (inspecting each bite carefully) when I found YET ANOTHER HAIR. This store needs to reevaluate their quality control. BEWARE."}
{"text":"There are things I like about this place and some I don't.  Let's start with the negatives.  If you want 2 flavors, you have to buy a larger size (which is always too much).  Other places, like That's Amore give you 2 flavors in the small container.  The other thing is that they scoop the gelato like ice cream and it's a little too cold like ice cream.  Gelato should be piled into the container a little sloppyly and it should be a couple of degrees warmer than ice cream.  The flavors are great and the stores are nice, but I am a gelato snob and prefer That's Amore."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, gelato, and service! Have been there several times and it has been awesome every time! At the top of our list when we want pizza and desserts! A must try!"}
{"text":"The gelato at \"The Gelato Spot\" was good, but I don't think it's ever really bad. 

The portions are small - as expected and all you need- the service was so-so, and the place wasn't busy inside. While you *can* ask for free samples, more than a couple samples seems frowned upon.

After the raving yelp reviews I was thinking this place would be magical or something. It's normal gelato, the way its served in hundreds of places across the country. Nothing out of the ordinary, and a little more costly.

I recommend the Chai gelato. Just don't sit outside in the AZ summers or it'll melt in a quarter of the time! :) 

Frankly, I'd save the money and buy a pint at Fry's to split with friends!"}
{"text":"YUM! Better than ice cream! And the wood-fired pizza isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Best Gelato! I am not a huge fan of sweets but I cannot resit the pull of this place. Not sure what you want, no worries since they will let you taste as many as you want until  you decide.  Taking it back to your office, not a problem, they have nice foam cups with lids to keep it from melting while you walk back."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale, and was looking for a local pizza joint. The Spot was within walking distance from my hotel. A mouth-watering display of gelatos greeted me as I entered, so I had to try the blueberry. It was rich in flavor and very satisfying! Oh, about that pizza. It was good, too! Our waitress was pleasant as well. I will certainly come back here next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I love the food. My kids always enjoy the gelato. The service is a little par par."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here. GREAT pizza. We always get a white pizza, followed by coffee and Gelato. Personally partial to the Dream pizza, an expresso, and the Stracciatella gelato. But I'm always excited to try new, limited time flavors as well. Like Girl Scout thin mint!!

All the flavors are perfectly balanced... while you get that nice full feeling from eating carbs, there's none of that greasy mess. 

The service is always so friendly. I've come in once or twice just to use the bathroom or grab a water from the dispenser they leave out and they're great about it. (Walking around Old Town gets hot very quickly)."}
{"text":"Right after I wrote my first review of this place, a groupon deal popped up that would let me try the pizza. I jumped right on it and used it today for lunch. 

We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.

The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those."}
{"text":"Went here twice on a recent 4 day trip to the area.  The first time was for the gelato, the second time was more for the free wifi.
Didn't really love the quality of the gelato, it was decent, but they get an extra star for fun flavors, like Bailey's and Samoas (the girl scout cookies)."}
{"text":"Talk about Service!  I received an awesome deal on my mobile phone to try out their new pizza's at the Oldtown location for $5 was I glad.   I ordered the BBQ chicken, without cheese, and had some arugula added, though it comes with cheese normally - it was absolutely awesome.  My kids enjoyed the margherita pizza and asked for more.  So then I went home and told my husband about it and he signed up for their mobile deals.  The next day, he ordered an Italian Sausage type pizza. Loved it.   We have since told many of our friends and family about this new addition to the Gelato Spot.   Customer service, staff and management is above par and we'll for sure be back.    So much better than other pizza places and healthier, too!  Now that I'm thinking about it....I'm craving it again."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in the country! I travel the world and love gelato. None compare in the US. I have had gelato in Miami, New York, SF, Chicago, LA, Vegas and none compare. They now serve personal size pizza too that is out of this world! Dont miss it."}
{"text":"Definitely an odd spot.  I used to come here all the time before they started serving food.  The owner doesn't seem to know how to solve seating arrangements.  This is the first time ever when in a \"seat yourself\" cafe they would not let a single person sit a table.  Even though there were many tables available.  The owner was concerned that some potential large party could show up later on so she wanted to keep the empty tables empty.  Clearly not a very customer friendly approach.  And kinda silly.  Gelato is great here.  Skip the food."}
{"text":"Note to management, remind your staff that customers keep your doors open & money in the servers pockets. I had heard so much about their new bar from friends, I thought I'd check it out.. It was slow, maybe a total of 7 people in the whole place. I was greeted by one girl, I ordered a scotch with a glass of water. She never returned. A second girl greeted me, I did the same order, she left as if to grab my order. She too did not return. A third girl approached and asked if I'd been helped, I said \" I think so, but I've been waiting 15 mins for a scotch and a water\" she replied that she'd find out \"what's going on\" and on this hot day I really wanted a water while I waited. I stared at the bottle of scotch whiskey just beyond arms length, wondering why this was so hard for them to do. I turned around in my seat to see the first girl looking at paperwork at a register and the other two nowhere in sight. I left and will never return. If you want good gelato or ice-cream, even alcoholic beverages, go somewhere like LGO or Churn instead. This place is generic, poorly run and in my opinion a waste"}
{"text":"We came here after having a terrible experience at Black and Blue in Scottsdale on Feb 13 Valentine's Day Saturday...and they really turned our evening around. We had delicious Caesar Salad and the American pizza...followed by gelato. Thank you for the great atmosphere and a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato. I had the Bacio (chocolate/hazelnut blend) and my husband had the chocolate caramel fudge brownie. Super rich and intense flavors. Nice interior space to sit as well. Perfect sweet end to the day."}
{"text":"We had the Testarossa pizza and it was exceptionally good -- spicy pepperoni, red peppers, etc-- really delicious. We also enjoyed our Caprese and Caesar salads, although we didn't need the bread that came with them (as much bread as salad) -- we just wanted the veggies. I'd rather have more salad and no bread. If I didn't live in Virginia, I'd be back for the fabulous pizza."}
{"text":"So good!  Definitely one my favorite dessert places.  Always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for gelato one afternoon, and it was pretty darn tasty.  The guy at the counter was very outgoing and chatty, and gladly let me sample a few flavors.  I went with the Almond Snickers and Almond Joy and enjoyed every fat gram.  Serving size was appropriate for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato, reminded me of Italy. I had the \"coconut ginger\" and \"strawberry, basil and balsamic vinegar\"."}
{"text":"Nifty store with an awesome showcase of treats. One night, raspberry with bacio. The razz was full of seeds and well, kinda \"beh\" in flavor. But the bacio...mmmmmm. Decadence. A lively choco hazelnut with good portions of hazelnuts.

A gem of a find  Hope to be back someday."}
{"text":"Came here after eating dinner in downtown Scottsdale with my wife. Lots of great flavors but my favorite part was the seating they had - it is against the street, nice lighting and some music playing. It was a great place to sit and chat while enjoying a nice dessert."}
{"text":"Simple but very good wood fired pizza.  The American pizza was very good, but a bit spicy for those who might like it more plain.  My wife had the Margarita pizza and enjoyed it as well.  Great selection of gelato for dessert.  Very pleasant wait staff and super quick service."}
{"text":"This review is for the pizza only.  I have not tried their Gelato yet as I usually get filled up on pizza and can't eat anymore.  Their pizza is the way is should be everywhere, thin crispy crust, good sauce and a sufficient amount of cheese.  I had the American pizza which has a bit of a spice to it and the margarita another time which you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The pizza was simply delicious!!!and the gelato was fantastic!!! Really yumm!!! We had a great lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Gelato love!

I have traveled near and far, high and low and this is the best gelato I've tasted in the US!  It comes the closest to the gelato made in Italy.  It's creamy with rich flavors and my mouth feels like it's in heaven every time I eat it.  I have visited a few different locations around town and they are always consistently delicious.

The staff is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  The Old Town location has a few comfortable lounging chairs with armrests and free wifi.  This is the perfect place to take a break and to get away from the AZ heat.

Definitely check it out.  You'll be addicted, I am!"}
{"text":"This is the best gelato ever! It's really not fair to compare it with any others. We come here every time we come to Spring Training, then we talk about it the rest of the year."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to find because it's in the Wood Fired Pizzeria place!

The selection of flavors is huge. I enjoyed the Salted Caramel while cooling off on the front porch.

Nice helpful wait staff. Clean place, I like the concept if the two types of eateries together."}
{"text":"I had my first trip to the Gelato Spot a few weeks ago.  My expectations were not all that high, only because I've had amazing gelato, but haven't been able to locate any in this state.  I was pleasantly surprised to see they had food as well; a decent selection of salads, paninis, and pizza.  My friend ordered a salad, which was huge, and looked very good.  I ordered a grilled cheese, which blew my mind!  Granted, I have a special weakness for grilled cheese, but the choice of cheese, and ripe tomatoes on this were definitely spot on.  

I wasn't going to order gelato (how wrong would that be, to go here and not try some!), but my friend talked me into it.  I have to agree with another reviewer who said the gelato was too rich.  I'm glad I ordered the small, because it was super rich and super sweet...a little too much for my liking.  That being said, so far this is the best gelato I've found in the area; you'd be amazed at what some places try to pass off as gelato.  There ought to be a law!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and so friendly. Lots of choice, clean, intentive staff, and quick service. Great option on a scorching hot day."}
{"text":"They dont make the gelato here so that is an automatic deduction in my book but it is still pretty fresh and very delicious. There are a ton of flavors to choose from and they will give you limitless samples. It is a bit overpriced but what isnt in Scottsdale. Overall if you are in the mood for gelato this place wont let you down unless you are a snob, and there is a good chance of that given the usual crowd in oldtown ;)"}
{"text":"The parking in Old Town Scottsdale can be at times a challenge. I was able to pull into the back of the restaurant and found parking without an issue. They share a small lot behind the building with the gallery center next door. Each spot has a sign indicating which business the parking is for; SOCA for the gallery and a G for Gelato Spot; and notification that you will be towed if you are not using that spot for the designated business. Upon finding the G spot I parked and we entered the resturant for pizza.
 We were 5 total. When we walked in the girl stated that it would be a second and she would seat us. That was followed a few minutes later by another girl stating that it will be just a second. Then a few minutes later a different girl asked how many in the party. I pointed to all of us and again she asked for the number. I stated 5 and she said that it will be a while as they need to clear a table. Ok. She acted like it would be a long while then followed up it would be 5-10 minutes. We were seating within 5 minutes when they pushed a couple empty tables together.
Once seating a guy came over to take our drink orders. We order and he brought them pretty fast. He then took our orders. 4 total pizzas; very thin crust about 10-12 inches, and two salads. Two pizzas were pepperoni, one from the options, and another was a create your own. So far so good.   Thing went south from here.
 This is just a tip. If you have say 100 seats available then one assumes that you want to fill those. So you have to staff accordingly. Having different wait staff say multiple times that they are really busy not real good. Either they are not experienced enough to multitask and do the job or you are truly understaffed which is a failure on managements part. Whatever the reason it does need to be addressed.
 The waiter came over and brought the salads. They were ok nothing really special. Not really a big fan on mostly white iceberg lettuce, a little more actual green leafs would help. Then pretty quickly the pepperoni pizzas came out. About 5-10 minutes later the \"options\" pizza came out. A large portion of it had burn crust. Maybe a little too much as neither of the pepperonis had any burnt spots. After about 15 minutes the forth pizza did not come out. The waiter was walking by so I asked him about it. He stated that he would get it, he checked and I guess they messed it up and were to remake it. That was the last he came to the table. There was suddenly a \"rush\" of people for the Gelato. Our waiter disappeared behind the counter and never returned to our table. I grabbed a waitress who was walking by and inquired as to our pizza. She asked what was on it and went to check. She came back with a pizza. As it was missing some of the items; I would say not the one we ordered. She did a drop and go and put the pizza down and scurried off. So when she did come back about 5 minutes later to inquire about it we stated that it was missing what we asked for however we were eating it anyway.
 At this point we kind of became self sufficient. It was free gelato night with a pizza order so we just got up and got our own. I also went to the \"bar\" to get my refills on the drinks and also got up to get a box to go. We received the bill and it was dropped and forgotten. We had the credit card displaying for over 10 minutes and no one came by. I walked up to the \"bar\" to pay.
 So - Because of all of the different mistakes they did take care of a lot. They removed the one pizza from the ticket and also gave a discount. That does mean a lot. The pizza was ok. The late one was cold by the time we got it. The salad below average. The gelato was pretty good. Green ice tea was also good.
Staffing issues needs to be addressed. The waiter who morphed into the gelato server stated that it was actually opposite. He was there to server gelato and helped wait the tables until they got busy in the gelato section. So it appears there was not a pass off to the actual wait staff. Over all maybe a C+. 
Since there are multiple gelato spots in Phoenix and well as wood fire and/or brick oven pizza places doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do all the workers here have a stick up there, you know? The last couple times I have been in the workers took about 10 minutes to finally come up and help my fiance and I out. Not even a hi. They just come up after 10 minutes of us standing there with a \"Uhh.. hello?\" look on our faces. The gelato is good, don't get me wrong. But I do enjoy customer service, and I really believe this location has none. So sad, I love the location on 40th St  & Greenway, but this location is way too snooty. So no thanks Gelato, I will be getting my cold dessert fix elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"If I am craving dessert, this is the place you will find me. I have always had a delightful experience here and have never been disappointed by my treats. The staff is always very friendly, personable, and attentive. I really enjoy the atmosphere here as well, it is modern and clean. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is craving a quality dessert!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, great service! Made a large catering order and everything was so fresh and tasty! Will order again!"}
{"text":"What is better than pizza and ice cream? There are plenty of gelato ice cream flavors to choose from but do try out chocolate caramel fudge brownie."}
{"text":"Gelato was good but don't order a milkshake.  They water the milkshake down with crushed ice.  Had I known that I would have stuck with the gelato."}
{"text":"We went to Spring Training a few weeks ago.  Of course it was hot and we had to go into the Gelato Spot. The  gelato was great the only thing is for the price we paid for a small cup of gelato wasn't so great...    I could have brought a gallon. 
 But we were there for Spring Training and we hadn't been to Scottsdale before so it was worth it."}
{"text":"this review is based on the gelato, alone. so as far as that goes, skip this place. I've passed by many times, and one night my boyfriend and I decided to stop in. the decor and concept is great. there's a pizza section, coffee & alcohol bar, and the gelato shop. the pizza may be great, but I only tried the gelato, and that was seriously disappointing. the flavors were just not there at all. I actually had to really try and figure out which flavor I was eating from my two scoop cup! my boyfriend had the same problem; absolutely zero flavor in the gelato. I couldn't even finish my cup, and had to throw it away. That's the exact opposite of what good gelato should make someone do."}
{"text":"There was a Groupon. Not sure why because they couldn't possibly need help selling this awesomeness. It was really really hot outside so it could have tasted like icy cardboard and I would have been happy. It did NOT taste like icy cardboard. This has to be some of the best gelato I've had outside of Italy. If I am ever back in the area, I'm coming here for sure."}
{"text":"The kids love the gelato. Despite the spring training crowds we were able to get a seat!"}
{"text":"They have lots of different flavors and are helpful if you want tontaste anything. When I went the mango had an off flavor but the cookies and cream was good. They give big portions for good price."}
{"text":"Good selection of gelato flavors, reasonable price. Watch out when there's a crowd though, service can be a little slow.

The buffalo mozzarella is good, but don't expect the pizza to be on par with New York or Chicago.  Still a lot better than dominos or other chains."}
{"text":"I decided to order pick up using the Eat2 services for lunch since my work place is walking distance from the restaurant. I put the pick up time @ noon. When I walked in I waited near the \"bar\" area for the hostess (she was on the phone taking a phone order) she saw me waiting to be helped but decided to help two men that were there after me instead. After helping them I told her I was there to pick up an order i placed using the Yelp app. She asked for my name and said nothing was received. I showed her the charge from my bank account and she placed the order to the cooks. I waited there for 20mins for my food. I had to rush back to my work place since I only have a 30min lunch. When I finally got to open my lunch at my desk it was cold. Not what I expected for a pre ordered panini that I had to wait 20 mins for."}
{"text":"My whole outlook on the horrible experience at the Gelato Spot changed by the immediate response by the owner. Not only did he apologize for the incident, but he offered me a gift certificate to use at his business.  This is the first time any business owner acted as professional as he did. I appreciated the amazing customer service that he offered and really made me feel like he really does care about his patrons. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love this little place.  The gelato (too many flavors tried to list here) rawks with flavor and softness.  Within the old Scottsdale area, I can't find a better place for espresso and real espresso drinks.  If I can't taste the espresso in a drink its not fer me.  I just wish that more peeps on the night shift knew how to make those scantily dressed espresso drinks. 

For the most part, the peeps behind the counter take care of my cravings with a diverse group of customers.   The decor is very cool and clean (a big Uhn)."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place.  The gelato is fantastic and consistent.  I stopped for a quick bite with my kids before a night out.  The pizza was large enough for the three of us to share.  The caprese salad was fresh and yummy.  Definitely a great little go to for a fresh and fast meal."}
{"text":"There's plenty of good reviews here, so I'm feeling confident that the 3 star rating will NOT hurt them... and it's not meant to!  G-Spot IS better than most in the valley... and if I remember correctly... they flew a guy and the equip from Italy to teach them all the secrets... but I find the fruit flavors are fleeting... 

I've eaten gelato for weeks on end in Europe (and yeah, there are the mediocore ones even with diligent research)... so I'm just holding out the extra star for the g-place that will make my heart sing!"}
{"text":"First off the service here is amazing! The two waitresses were so nice to the group of us when we went there on our lunch break and there service was excellent. The food came out fast and was SO delicious. Plus the whole vibe of the place is chill and modern, definitely a place I'll be visiting more. The fresh basil on my margarita pizza was the topping to an excellent lunch. Thanks Gelato Spot for an awesome and fast lunch experience!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy all the times I have came here. They have great Gelato and so many options. The staff is pretty friendly too, except for yesterday. My friend and I went to get some Gelato and we checked into foursquare. They do this promo if you text to 30364 and type OMG you get a dollar off your bill. I was trying to tell the girl at the register that and she had NO idea what I was talking about, but the girl scanning all the groupon codes or something knew exactly what I was talking about. The girl scanning the coupons didn't stop at all to help her coworker what it was about, but the girl at the register couldn't wait for us to send the text and took the cash and gave the change to my friend. Granted its only a dollar, but the service on their part was awful. All employees should understand what ever social media is going around promoting their restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great!   I've come here at least ten times for dessert and I've always left happy. Their flavors are all delicious!  The staff is always smiling and happy, and they are great at suggesting new flavors."}
{"text":"Yum, yum! I hate paying so much for a scoop of ice cream, it is out of control,  but it is good! Too many flavors I like, wish I could eat them all!"}
{"text":"So good and extensive selections. Definitely recommend , especially to beat the summer heat!"}
{"text":"I write this with deep regrets.  I gave this place two try's neither with success. I do realize this is a Gelato spot that employees High School kids. So my expectations weren't very high when it came to service. But you would think having to only scoop Gelato it would be a simple task even a kid could do. My first attempt here I asked for a double scoop in a medium bowl and I was served two medium bowls with one flavor in each. My second attempt I asked for a large bowl with two scoops. I went for the large this time because I did enjoy the Gelato.  But I was served a medium with two very small scoops. I guess asking for two scoops in a large bowl confused the girl as a large would normally come with three scoops and the small portion was so they could put a lid.
My suggestion would be go right down the street to the Sugar Bowl which had great service great ice cream with no attitude from their employees when you ask them to fix the mistake."}
{"text":"We began with a pizza. We tried the pig and pineapple. It was a fantastic balance of ham, pineapple, basil, sauce and cheese. Not heavy, a beautiful thin crust and delicious.  Next we moved on to the gelato. Oh wow. So much to chose from. I had tiramisu and lemon. So incredible. My friend had the coffee and chocolate caramel fudge brownie. All four flavours were out of this world. The best part it didn't break the bank. The service is friendly and wonderful. It made our day. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little shop with gelato and coffee. Nice seating areas and plenty of gelato flavors to choose from. I went with pineapple which was tangy and sweet with bits of pineapple in it. The staff will give you samples of any flavor you want so be sure to ask. I as tempted with the red velvet but it was what I expected. The pineapple was refreshing and I found a seat in the lower section with cushions to eat."}
{"text":"It's a happening place in the right location. Gelato is good. Lots of samples, and people pushing each other around to get tastes. Crowded."}
{"text":"The variety of flavors is astounding...how do they come up with this stuff?  I haven't had anything bad and the place is adorable...nice if you want a cool after dinner dessert out on the town."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Awesome selections of gelato and all delish. Want to try some of their coffee drinks or alcoholic smoothies sometime. Very friendly service !!! Comfortable seating inside and outside...
The price points are on the higher end ( this isn't Dairy Queen!) but definitely worth it every once in awhile."}
{"text":"The staff was snobby. It was difficult to locate a menu. They acted like I was inconveniencing them by ordering there. There are no outlets, so not good for studying. They brought me a sandwich, even though I ordered a pizza. Then they brought my pizza, which was mediocre."}
{"text":"We were about to head to Pizzeria Bianco because we had read rave reviews about it on the flight from San Diego.This place turned out to be very good.The pizzas were a Northern Neapolitan style being a bit crispier and not soggy in the middle.My wife and I enjoyed both of our hand made pizzas very much.Thank you to chef Nicko.We had to try the gelato after eyeballing the huge selection when we first came in.Our gelatos were very,very good.In fact my wife thought hers was the best she had ever had.The service was warm and personal,even the owner's son Tommy popped over to say hello.This is a great place for pizza and gelato."}
{"text":"Visit this location quite often.  Showed up Saturday night to order a pizza and was told I could order but had to take it to go since they were closing in 30 minutes.  Was told it took 15 minutes for the pizza to be ready.  Sad to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place the pizza's are outstanding and the Gelato is excellent, look for their groupon well worth a trip !!!"}
{"text":"Dit is echt een fijne plek, er staan voortdurend rijen dik van mensen die ijsje bestellen en je kunt het zo gek niet bedenken of ze hebben die smaak. Natuurlijk hebben ze geen dropsmaak.
Maar de Gelato Spot heeft niet alleen ijs, ze hebben ook krokante pizza's en prima koffie. En je kunt er uren zitten zonder dat je het gevoel hebt dat je de tent wordt uitgekeken. Hier kom ik graag."}
{"text":"Went here last night after eating dinner at AZ88. I had a scoop of coffee toffee crunch and my boyfriend had a cookies&cream/mint milkshake. Both were great! No complaints at all.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"I was at the comedy club next door and was excited to see that they offered delivery from The Gelato Spot. I ordered a pizza and a chopped salad. I told them I would pay by cash and gave them my table number. Our delivery came within 15 minutes. The total was $27 and I gave the guy $40 since I only had $20 bills. He said he didn't have change and I said that was all I had. He could have gone back to the restaurant and brought me change, but didn't offer it and left with the money. I'm a generous person and I always tip for delivery but a $13 tip on a $27 meal is a 48.14% tip which is quite absurd. I also didn't want to make a scene since the comedians were already performing. What would have happened if I only had a $50 or $100 bill!? I felt superiorly ripped off, but since the comedians were so hilarious, I laughed my displeasure away.

The pizza and salad were okay so that's why I generously still offered 2 stars. 

So if you guys plan to order delivery, you better have the exact change or be prepared to pay an enormous tip for a delivery that may not be worth it."}
{"text":"I was in the old town area and wanted a quick bite and saw this spot on the corner. 

It has 3 different concepts, pizza and gelato downstairs and a bar upstairs. 

The pizza was decent. It was well cooked and the meat was good. 

It came out hot and rather quickly. The price was right and the pizza I got was only $12. 

The gelato looked great but I didn't get any. 

If I'm in the area and want some pizza and/or gelato I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Really bad pizza. Tried the honey basil, wife and I both spit out the first bite and I took the whole box directly to the trash. That bad. Testarossa wasn't much better, but was edible. So much for pizza night in our hotel."}
{"text":"Coming back home from old town scottsdale we noticed the wood fire pizzeria and gelato place. The yelp reviews were good so what did we have to lose? Pulling into the back they have a pretty good amount of parking for a restaurant in this section of town.

We were greeted by a cheerful cashier and perused the menu of a wide variety of pizza choices, gelato and coffee.  They have a huge selection of gelato in a large glass ounter in the front. It was pretty impressive. It's a bright modern pizzeria inside it appeared from the outside to have an upstairs, but I didn't notice a way to get to it. We grabbed a seat in the outer dining room not noticing it was cleverly disguised out door seating.  I can't really recommend it on unusually cold days in December, but it wasn't too bad.

The pizza guy twirling the crusts on the side counter which was a pretty cool touch.  The food was a pretty good size, came out promptly,  and had a good wood fired crunchy crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. 

I'll definitely be back for another pie and try the gelato and coffee.

Try:

- Veggie White Pizza"}
{"text":"I've had gelato and pizza here.  Both are wonderful  Not your ordinary pizza either.  Very nice surprise."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times:I figured I would give it a second, then third shot...

The food and Gelato are so-so at best, and the staff are spectacularly unhelpful. 
I'll take ice cream form the super-market instead of over priced and unfriendly. 

The few times I was there I also waited 10 minutes when they were only a little busy, and up to 25 when they were pretty busy.

I would seek out something else. Like I said, not great all around.




In response to the comment below from Tommy:

I do appreciate your accommodations, I have no doubt that you do value your customers. I am not one to jump to a conclusion about any establishment, and I did come in several times. Overall I was unimpressed by the quality of the service every time, and the food was, in my opinion, sub-par. 

I do appreciate you taking the time to respond to this and I am glad that others liked your establishment. As I see from other reviews, my experiences were hopefully the only three times the staff and kitchen were having a bad day."}
{"text":"The perfect \"spot\" to cool down from a heatwave! Whoever dreamt up the chocolate and pistachio combo was a genius -- most unique flavor gelato I've tried to date!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived here in Scottsdale for years and I've never been here! The vegan chocolate is the best!!!!!!! This place is perfect for a late night stop after a night out. It's open until 12AM"}
{"text":"The Gelato Spot was a random find of ours while walking around Old Town Scottsdale. Neither my date nor I were too incredibly hungry so we thought we'd get a couple of things to share. To start, we got the capriciossa pizza. It was absolutely delicious! It took a while to come out even though it wasn't too busy in the restaurant, however it was worth the wait. The crust was crispy and the toppings tasted really fresh. I'd definitely drive back there just for this!

After we were done with the pizza, we also got a couple of gelatos. They were super nice in offering samples which we took them up on. I ended up getting the Roasted Almond one & it was really tasty! Not only that, but it was also really light & airy. I believe that dessert goes to the place in  your stomach that doesn't exist which means you can have has much as you want ... right? Anyways, for this as well, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We've coming here for a couple of years and this will be a short review:

Seriously good gelato.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"So many kinds gelato. Can eat inside in a comfy chair or at a table outside. Went with straight up chocolate which was rich and cramy. Others tried mango and coffee. Rave reviews. .Skip desert when you eat at a Scottsdale restaurant and walk here instead. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review and bringing them down from 5 stars to 4.

The gelato, pizza, salads, and sandwiches are crazy good, and everyone who works here is very nice.

If you haven't been here recently, it's changed from a place where you could go order pizza or a sandwich at the counter and then sit down to a traditional restaurant where you sit down and order ... but then you still have to get up and order gelato at the counter.

I hear they might be changing it around in the coming months, so I'm not sure if their identity crisis is a good thing or a bad thing.  What I do know is that last night when I came in for dinner it was the worst service I've had there, and I hope it improves."}
{"text":"Well I start this review off by saying their gelato is pretty good. So they at least got that going for them...

However my main motivation was the wood fired pizza.  They have a bunch of great toppings and different types of cheeses, my favorite of course being prosciutto.  Pizza was kinda soggy, which surprised me with being a wood fired oven? The kitchen also messed up and we got our pizza before our appetizer.  The server was gracious and comped it for us without us even saying a word, which was the right thing to do.

I will give this place another shot for pizza and to try different types of gelato!  Give it a shot, maybe just got them on a bad day."}
{"text":"So there are a couple different locations and this is the second location I've been to. Each has it's own decor going on... with this one being much more loungy with big couches and chairs all over the place.

Cool place.

But gelato is to die for. Forget Coldstone and come and get something at least halfway healthy! And better yet, it tastes phenominal.

Plus, you can stand there and bother the workers to get samples of everything they have... if you really wanted to. But, if you are like me, you get tunnel vision and order the same thing every time - Amarena.

OK, I lied. Last time I went I actually tried another flavor - Caramelo.

So now I am in a debacle... because I love both flavors. Maybe this is my chance to break routine and try yet another flavor. Hmmm, we will see... my beloved Amarena calls my name ever so strongly every time I stare through that cold case window.

Alright, I need to get going... to the G-spot!

PS - check in a few times on Yelp and get a coupon and from what I hear Foursquare has a coupon as well!"}
{"text":"While it was good, I was not impressed. I enjoyed the hand-tossed crust on the pizza and how the spicy sausage was actually spicy. But otherwise it didn't stand out. I loved the wide selection of gelato flavors! But it wasn't as good as I was expecting. But I loved the service!"}
{"text":"Has some awesome ice cream choices. Dont love the food here."}
{"text":"Top notch for dessert and coffee in Old Town. Great selection of Gelato and cafe choices. 

The furniture is all modern and the vibe is very upscale. Great place."}
{"text":"Excellent gelato.  I love that they text you deals and coupons!!"}
{"text":"The gelato was good, but the seating was tight. Running both a pizza restaurant and gelato shop in such a small space makes it cramped. All and I would definitely return, unless I thought it would be a busy time because seating would be limited."}
{"text":"Slightly trendy.
Priced accordingly.
Most of the staff are friendly... sometime. The rest ... well, not so much!
Love that it stays open late, and car park is right out back.
Love the tiramisu.

Will ride my bike here again, later than soon! ^_~"}
{"text":"Best Gelato! Lots of different flavors and the friendly staff is always happy to provide endless samples, upon request. My fav is vegan chocolate."}
{"text":"Yes they have great gelato, but the pizza, salads and coffee bar are not to be pushed into the background!

This place is a gem. Clean, consistant, quick, courteous, open late, conveniently located and D-Lish! 

 Let's face it, at any given moment you either want food, coffee or desert. The G spot has it all! 

The atmospere is good. It's comfortable and inviting. The music is not too loud and the music selection is generally good. (Translation: They don't play hip-hop and rap like most downtown Scottsdale places!)

We love the Gelato spot!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too happy with the pistachio flavour...didn't taste genuinely pistachio... and was salty :(
The seating area was nothing special either so not really inviting to stay in the cafe to eat. Didnt try their pizza but was disappointed with their Gelato...People should go to Cool Gelato Italiano for gelato instead"}
{"text":"i love love loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the gelato in old time scottsdale.. they by far have the best gelato in town... iam not much of a ice cream person but when i tried it for the first time i feel in love...they have unbelievable flavors, things i have never seen before like blackberry or copa mista which is their best seller ( chocolate ,vanilla , pistachio, almond gelato)yum yum yum....my fav is the coconut macadamia nut... its to die for...I ve tried other gelato places like the gelato spot but nothing really compares.  Old town Gelato makes their gelato from scratch using only natural flavors where as gelato spot orders kits and and just adds dairy to it. The gelato at Gelato Spot is soooooooo sweet u need water right after to kill the sugar taste. 

Gelato classico is family owned and operated so u see the same ppl there at all times. check it out u wont be disappointed ..."}
{"text":"Yes, i am a huge fan of Gelato Spot. Just a short drive from my house. I love the coconut, pistachio and hazelnut. Ben loves the peanut butter, chocolate with peanut butter cups added in. I must say I would have given this 5 stars but out of over a dozen visits I have only had one nice counter person. That was on Tuesday night, May 5. A young woman was working with him as well and was very friendly. Also, the passion fruit sorbeto was paradise! 

One visit a girl was incredibly rude to a guest by ignoring him just before serving me. All he wanted was a glass of water and she made him wait. I was so turned off. She actually said to me in front of the guest \"some people don't know how to wait their turn\". I told her I didn't mind but she ignored my request as well. The next visit the young man seemed disgusted for guests to come in at 9:30 p.m. when they are open until 10 p.m. during the week. What else do you have to do for 30 minutes. I got the impression \"my parents made me get a job\". Good luck with your future kiddo."}
{"text":"I've always recommended this place until now I arrived here about 4:30 and wasn't even greeted. This lady popped up from the back 20 minutes after we arrived. When my boyfriend and I were ready to order she was rudely on her phone texting I said excuses me 3 times and she ignored me repeatedly so I had walk up right infront of her face and ask if she could take my order. My boyfriend ordered two scoops and got half of one and I got less than that. I've never experienced this type of horrible service and I've been coming here for years. After I asked for a manager the rude lady behind the counter said she was the manager and I could call whoever I wanted. I will never come back ever again."}
{"text":"Came here when I was on a walk with my three other friends. We walked in to the beautiful display of Gelato, which we initially came for the wood fired pizza but just couldn't resist to try some. Of course everything was awesome. We got the Margherita and American pizza both were super fresh and light just the way they should be. I think my favorite part is the atmosphere. The servers were all very nice with a smile on their faces and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try the pizza here on two separate trips to Scottsdale and finally got the chance.  Huge disappointment. The pizza had an odd taste and we gave up on it halfway through.  The gelato was good."}
{"text":"We went to dinner a decided to stop by and have gelato for desserr......they had about 34 different flavors.......to many to choose from so we ordered two flavors in a cup......it was very good and flavorful. ....I tried the strawberry and it was very refreshing. .......excellent.......also we had the coffee gelato that was very good.....great place to go enjoy felato......"}
{"text":"They ruined the place - was a great place to go after a play or a movie - date night for us to have gelato and good coffee - but NOT now - you have a different crowd and pizza - it is not a gelato spot it is a pizza joint - there is no place to sit outside on these beautiful evenings like before unless you want to sit with the smokers - yuck.  

How could you do this?  You had a nice and classy place before - unique to the area and you got greedy - the in crowd will leave you and the neighbors like us will not come back now that you have that big honking pizza oven - yes, it smells like a pizza joint - yikes - what a shame - we came for the last time tonight and hurried in and out with our lattes and gelatto in a half hour - could not wait to leave - AC everywhere - loud people - pizza smell and smokers too close to the door - could smell in all of the patio area - good luck to you - you have made a mistake with this one."}
{"text":"Amazing chocolate vegan gelato! They use coconut milk and it tastes just as good if not better than regular gelato. Thank you to the guy and girl up front who helped me with my UberEATS delivery today. They didn't have the flavor my customer requested and offered me free gelato while I was on hold with support. Customer wanted Caramello, but they had salted caramel which my customer was happy with. Very patient and generous, so sorry I didn't have cash on me to tip you! Thanks again for the great service and tasty treat (:"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The gelato was so smooth. I got the snickers and the mint chocolate chip. The smooth creamy texture was a little weird with the mint chocolate chip flavor but the snickers one was so yummy. The gelato was a little on the sweet side which is not really my preference but it was still good."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff here. Was in town for the week and stumbled upon the Gelato Spot and it was just what I was looking for late at night.  Not cheap but very very good."}
{"text":"Firstly, if you haven't had gelato (Italian ice cream), it is better than American ice cream - no explanation necessary, just try it for yourself. Especially from The Gelato Spot, they are the ones that converted me. I've had store bought gelato, and gelato from side kiosks at the mall and what not, but they don't compare.

This is their best location because of the adjoining pizzeria, and structure of the building: larger lot, more seating, nicer everything, etc. 

My favorite flavors are their cake batter and pistachio. They also have plenty of sorbet flavors as well (which keeps the vegans in mind) unlike other ice cream parlors in the valley. If I don't come here once a month I get withdrawals. Experiencing them now, time for a visit!"}
{"text":"Its just artificially flavored frozen milk. Nothing like real gelato. Couldn't finish the tiramasu. Felt as if was eating frozen chemicals."}
{"text":"Great gelato. It's actually very creamy so kinda taste more like an ice cream but still incredible. Lots of flavors probably 30+. Haven't had a bad one yet. Love the Roche, chocolate and pistachio.
Just had a pizza last visit- they have a new pizza oven. Good thin crust, tasty ingredients, soggy in the middle kind of like Pomo. 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"They have the best creamiest gelato and such a great variety of flavors....next trip to AZ I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amarena, bacio, toffee crunch, pumkin mousse cake - oh, YUM!! For the $12 that I paid, it's definitely worth it! Smooth, flavorful and creamy. It reminded me of my trip to Italy all over, again.

This is a great gelato spot. It's definitely at a great location, for some people watching. The folks were friendly and patient, as I asked to sample several of their flavors. 

A must check out spot, when you want your sweet tooth satisfied."}
{"text":"My friends and I hit up the Gelato Spot on my recent visit to Scottsdale and what a perfect way to end the day!

I was waffling between one and two flavors (one being small and two being two scoops/medium) and I finally chose medium because I couldn't pick just one flavor! Calories be damned! I really enjoyed my Toasted Almond and Coconut. YUM. It came with a long cookie which was a nice touch. 

You've gotta know what you want when you get up there. Those ladies like to keep the line moving! They'll let you taste flavors, but they'll help the next person in line while you're deciding."}
{"text":"This place has it all. I loved the gelato (coconut & strawberry). I am not sure how crowded is the shop in the weekend though. I would like to go there again to taste pizza and coffee and gelato again with my works to be done. :D"}
{"text":"Best gelato I have ever had. Tons of flavors, so many that I couldn't choose because they all were really good! Nice interior and exterior of building to allow for various seating areas."}
{"text":"I love going here because they stay open pretty \"late\". Everytime I come here I love the area is old town scottsdale and walking into this place, you're greeted with a nice staff and also a pretty nice interior. I'll have to dine here during the day to experience it better. The gelato selection is pretty large. I usually get more fruity choices and it's delicious. I think this place needs more credit with their great tasting gelato. One of my favorite late night spots."}
{"text":"My \"D-Spot\".  ;-)  Where I can \"Decompress\" after an intense work day. 
Not to mention the best cup of Matcha in town.  Thanks, Don!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place especially when they open up the windows you get a nice breeze and great view of scottsdale road. .I feel like I'm on vacation when I'm here. .. food is great and I highly recommend any of their salads if your eating healthy. ..don't forget the gelato especially the vegan chocolate"}
{"text":"Good lunch & dinner food and great food prices during happy hour, and good choices of vegetarians. I got the Foccacio Chop Salad and thought it was pretty good.  I really liked the foccacio on the bottom - it was quite thin (same as their pizzas) and topped with a delicious oil herb blend. The salad itself was fine, I would have liked more \"fat\" in it (cheese and avocado), but it was still good. The dressing was a delicious lemon oil/vinegar blend - very light and refreshing without the heaviness/sourness of normal balsamic. My husband had the meatball panini and liked it a lot - great sauce, great meatballs, good wood-fired bread. There are tons of different gelato flavors, for every mood, so it's hard to go wrong there.

The only bad part of the experience was the service. I came in on a Wednesday at 5 and the place was deserted, just 2 other tables with people. I sat waiting for a menu for at least 10 minutes, while politely making eye contact with all of the servers yet no one came over, until I got it myself. Server took a long time to take our order and when the food was done it sat (visible to us) for minutes and minutes. At this point I knew we're in for bad service so I just sat and watched, and I saw one server tell our server that the food was ready but our server kept reviewing receipts from earlier in the day. Eventually the food was brought over, the order was incorrect, and the server takes it back and says to the chef \"well she allegedly ordered XYZ\". Allegedly...I'm a polite and nice person and sort of expect the same in return. I hope this experience was an anomaly because it seemed the other tables were being waited on well (by a different server) so maybe I just got someone having an off day. If the service hadn't been such an affront after a long day at work, 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the friendliest place I have been!  The staff is great, the gelato and the food is amazing!!  Try the Chicken Louie Wedge Salad, you will not regret it.  Great atmosphere :) I cannot say enough good things about this Gelato Spot"}
{"text":"the G-spot offers a smorgasbord of different flavors... more than 20 flavors for sure! A cup of gelato offered single scoop, double, and triple melts away all the trouble clouding your mind or for a brief period enjoying this sweet concoction of deliciousness and all things yum and creamy you put your troubles aside and enter the happy zone of gelato world. 

Like any good gelato establishment samples are encouraged especially since there are too many flavors and the combinations are endless, like a scoop of the rum raisin with the roche. I tend to go for the gelato's with liqueurs since there's nothing wrong with some yummy alcohol mixed in with cream. 

At G-spot they explain the positives of why gelato is better than ice cream, it's a spin but heck explain all you want and in the end I'll look at it and be like...\"of course gelato is better than ice cream with 32% less butterfat, my body should thank me that I chose this healthier option! Oh another cup you say? Ok... (tell myself, reassure myself... it's healthy) one more please =)\". Gelato mi amigos is worth the calories!! YUM!!!

This location is at the corner of 3rd ave and Scottsdale, so it's outside seating makes a good place to people watch, and the layout of the store has couches, and numerous tables to sit with large windows, and free wi-fi. It's an awesome place and the prices are inexpensive. SO if I'm not feeling a froyo run, my next option is gelato and this is the place that I frequent! Oh and this is an awesome place for an after dinner date!"}
{"text":"Clean, cozy, and the gelato was amazing!! Sooo many different flavors to choose from!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Gelato places in the valley that I have tried.   Only one I've been to better is in Tucson, and that place is like being in Italy, this place is a hairs width from that.  Wonderful service, great atmosphere, parking isn't too bad, and prices are reasonable for what you are getting.  We will be back, again and again and again.  They let you taste anything you want before you order too!"}
{"text":"Hands down best gelato in Scottsdale! Authentic and made fresh daily. I would recommend this spot for a good bite to eat and some delicious desert."}
{"text":"Great flavors and good quality. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  I like coming here."}
{"text":"Im putting the same review on the 2 listing because My expeirence involved both locations. One location should not be isolated.


I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!


Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. 
I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.





Lindsay,



Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot.

{"text":"Love this place the service is great.  All the employee's are friendly and go the extra mile.  The food has always been very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"As on out-of-towner, I discovered this place thanks to Yelp.  What a find!  We came for lunch with our 2 young boys and the staff was so friendly with them.  They have an enclosed porch area for perfect people watching.  The interior looks great for a casual but hip place to watch a game and dive into the thin crust pizza. The sandwiches were  also well-executed.  And the gelato (so many choices) was just as I remembered it at my fave gelato place in Florence, Italy.  I just love a kid-friendly, hip and foodie(esque)place!"}
{"text":"This place transported me back to Rome. Quite a few flavors of gelato available-lots of interesting ones and all seemingly executed correctly. 

I had pineapple and raspberry which were absolutely delicious. 

They top it off with a small cookie and you could not find a better place to enjoy an after dinner gelato.

Just like in Rome, found a place to sit with my friends and we chatted about whatever it was interesting that night and People watched. 

Lots of college kids. 

It was a great time. 

I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This Gelato Spot is great, not only do they have gelato, but they have food.  Yes, full menu of salads, paninis and pizzas.  I have had a few salads so far.  They were very good.  I can't wait until I am having carbs again so I can try their pizza.  The smells from the wood fire oven were amazing."}
{"text":"Great gelato and got a $1 off when you go thru Yelp for text coupon.  I had coffee and wife had peanut butter, but there were a ton of non-traditional and yummy looking flavors we could have chosen from.  As good as the gelato we had in Italy."}
{"text":"Love this place! I went here many times when I lived in Scottsdale! Perfect for those hot summer days - pizza and gelato. What more could you ask for? They also did a competition of unique local flavor a which provided for great new flavors to try. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great selection of gelato! Across from the Marriot Suites. Service is great! Sample the flavors before selecting. Open later than usual establishments in the area. Always lots of people inside. Try it...won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think its time to update my review. As board exams come closer, I have been frequenting this place more and more as my study spot. I've been downing gelato shakes, sandwiches and pizza left and right and putting on some much need poundage. Before I review the food, I just want to mention that the biggest thing since I started coming here years ago is the customer service. The service here has immensely improved since last year and I am thankful for it. The staff is super friendly and helpful and really attentive to the customer. I do not think they are taking their brand for granted anymore - it is a nice turnaround! Also in my previous review, I questioned the layout, but I rescind that opinion. I like it now, its grown on me. It appears more spacious and there seems to be an upstairs that will eventually be opening. I like the fact they have electrical outlets all around and three different areas for you to settle down in. This location really does accommodate a variety of customers from the student to the family of 4 who is ready for a treat.

my favorite salad: the focaccia chop salad with chicken:
comes with cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, diced cucumbers, avacado all on top of baked focaccia flatbread.  this is just the most refreshing thing you can eat on a summer afternoon. i do wish there was a tad more chicken...they dice the chicken up so small that its a little tough to get a good bite using a fork. 

best hot panini:
bbq chicken sandwich w/o bacon - wood fired chicken with chipotle bbq sauce and onions...flavorful and filling. 

i would suggest staying away from the grilled cheese panini. It isn't the typical grilled cheese we all think about it - it's got mozarella, provolone, gorgonzola....for some reason i decided to go wild and get something new and i knew i should have after my second bite. just not my thing.

best cold panini:
sometimes you gotta go with something simple and this is the way to go. the oregano and olive oil mixed into this sandwich was done right.

best pizza:
bufala: mozarella, basil, oregano, tuscan olive oil...one of the few pizzas i enjoy sans meat. all the food here is filling except for the pizza. i can get through a pizza and still feel my stomach grumbling. definitely a good item if you're only a little hungry, but if you think about sharing 1 pizza - be prepared to be ordering in another 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Love Gelato and I love the Gelato Spot.  Came here for a midday sweet treat a few days ago.  Just a scoop of the Stracciatella... so yummy!  I will be back for sure:)."}
{"text":"Just ordered some gelato.  I sampled a few flavors that were popular but I didn't find them tasty.  But decided on strawberry and that was tasty.  The salted caramel was slightly bland.  This is a casual location to hang out at."}
{"text":"My only problem with this place is that it's not closer to me!
The service was great, the employees were very friendly and helpful even with a large amount of people! Also, I love the look of this place! As some other reviews have mentioned, it's connected to a pizza place (which I haven't tried but it smelled really good) so there's lots of indoor seating, plus a few tables outside.
Huge selection of gelato flavors - along with the classics, there were a lot of interesting ones that you don't see everyday. My friends and I all loved our desserts. There's definitely something for everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this area every year and The Gelato Spot has become a necessary place to visit. We love choosing from the huge selection of flavors. See you in February!"}
{"text":"My first gelato experience! I thought it was great. 

This place also has food and pizza. 

Flat screens and outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"So they now have a pizza kitchen area and another area that I don't recognize on the other side of the room.  The pizza's A-ok, nothing that blows your mind - good crust, can be a little firmer in the middle of the pie, nice size.  The chop salad (?) served on foccascia was good.

The problem with it all is that now its confusing, there are 2 registers and a \"wait staff\" to bring you the food, but the drink is self-serve and you have to pay at one of the registers.  

There may be no better way to do this, but if they can figure out a better way to make it work a bit more streamlined and less confusing for new customers it would be a boon."}
{"text":"If you know gelato, you will know that in Italy, the gelato stores have turned displaying their gelatos into a high art form. The Gelato Spot came pretty darn close to that! I could not resist those wonderful swirls of goodness. 
My husband and daughter are certified gelato fanatics...and they loved it too.
My favorite: the lemon gelato!!!!!! refreshing and flavorful. 
You can't go wrong with the gelato here. (We didn't have anything but the gelato, so I can't speak to the rest of their offerings.)"}
{"text":"I've been to this Gelato Spot a number of times and will be back again soon I'm sure.  While I am always partial to mint chip in any form of ice cream or gelato, I have actually branched out and tasted many of the flavors here and have not been disappointed.  The pistachio and the peanut butter are really rich and taste just like the real thing.  I also appreciate that the place is open til at least 11 every night including Sundays (midnight on Fridays and Saturdays).  I just have to take one star off for the service, which can be a bit unfriendly at times."}
{"text":"Great place for some delicious ice cream! Stop by on a hot day in AZ (there are many) to cool off with a tasty treat! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There is always a debate among those who have visited Italy and tasted authentic gelato and think that G-Spot is right on the money or those who have that pretentious, \"Well it's no where NEAR as good as it is in Italy, when I stay there bla bla.\" No duh it's not as good as if you were in Italy, but let me tell you, it's pretty damn close! Their cappuccinos and coffees are decent too."}
{"text":"All of us enjoyed the gelato.  My son didn't get what he ordered and the worker behind the counter took the gelato back without question and fixed the order right away.  Lots of flavors and a nice spot.  Exactly what you would expect/hope for."}
{"text":"I went here off of my Groupon purchase. I know there are a few top notch Pizza places in the Phoenix area so I had high hopes for this one and they didn't disappoint. 

I was a little confused going in on how things worked. The short version? Order your pizza at the register by the oven, fill your own drinks with the exception of coffee which will be brought out to you. Find a seat with your number and wait for deliciousness to be brought to your table. 

We all enjoyed our pizza's and the Gelato was amazing. Pumpkin pie was sooooo good. 

I do have to say we were a little apprehensive going in, it isn't what you would think of when you think of good pizza, it looks like a brightly lit ice cream parlor more than a sit down pizza place, but really it is both. 

Next time I am in that part of town, I will for sure stop for a Gelato, there are so many choices and so little time."}
{"text":"Awesome flavors and friendly place.  Pokket coffee, almond snicker, cookies and cream... Always favorite

Great cakes, too.  In fact, this has been the only place we've gotten cakes for special birthdays and such for quite a while now.  They're good, reasonably priced and right-sized..

Good espresso.

Very authentic, European feeling to the place.

I can't wait to go back and try out their wood-fired pizzas."}
{"text":"Light airy pizza and a great place to stop on way home ....they do a great job with their pies...highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent gelato, coffee, snacks and breakfast.  I stop by often for coffee and a tiny sized gelato as often as I can.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. Lot of flavors to choose from. I like the taste and its better than what I expected. 
My friends and I had fun time there sitting out at night. They are open a little late. Nice place to hangout with friends. I would come again to try out some more flavors soon."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! the gelato here was great and they have so many flavors. Their Almond Snickers flavor was incredible. And the service was friendly. the only reason i am not giving this place 5 stars is because of the price. kinda spendy"}
{"text":"And...the pizza is absolutely amazing too!  How can you go wrong with great pizza and gelato all under one roof?!?"}
{"text":"OMG!  What a selection of gelato.... Had to taste almost everything.  Service was great, costs very reasonable, and the in house made gelato delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of fine Italian and American flavors in a very nice ambiance. This is a place for winning gelato in a super environment."}
{"text":"Creamy, delicious, refreshing coconut Gelato. Pricey and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love the gelato here. My fav in the valley. Perfect texture, smooth and light, great full flavors. It's my go to for gelato!"}
{"text":"Very thin crust, artisanal type pizza. Light on the cheese. Slightly crispy, slightly soft crust. Quality toppings, but not a ton of them. Overall, a decent pizza. You won't be disappointed, but you may not be recommending it to everyone you know either."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had. Lean cuisine pizzas have more flavor. It's actually difficult for something to taste so bland."}
{"text":"Good. 
God. 
Scoop of chocolate gelato in a cup of espresso. I can't stop craving it."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious. Try the almond snickers gelato--amazing taste and texture. EVERYTHING looked good. Friendly, quick staff. Indoor and outdoor seating. A great spot."}
{"text":"Good gelato."}
{"text":"Good Gelato along with pizza, salads and sandwiches. Expresso & coffee too."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a hot summers day. what a wonderful experience this was. the staff here were very knowledgeable on their Gelato and gave us free samples of every flavor on display.
I would recommend all of their flavors."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled upon this place while looking (unsuccessfully) for a different  restaurant in Scottsdale.  Very happy accident!  I lived in Italy for a year and came home loving wood fired pizzas.  These were really good.  Hubby had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I had the Primavera, which has prosciutto and arugula.  We were super pleased with both.  My house salad was also very good.  I had the salted caramel gelato for dessert, which was decadent and delicious at first, and then it got a bit too salty for me.  But, I'm sure many others would love it.  Service was friendly and cheerful, even the gals behind the gelato counter.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So fantastically delicious!!! Can't recommend enough. No beer on the patio though. The chocolate car make fudge is to die for. They have plenty of flavors and the price is not bad at all. They also offer other eats"}
{"text":"Favors are very light tasting. If you like this style this place is for you. Nice small place, good comfortable seating area. Gelato is combined with pizza and espresso bar. Nice concept to bring in a variety of needs. Food. Dessert. Coffee"}
{"text":"Who knew this place served brick oven pizza?! I got the simplest of them all- the margharita, and it was delicious! Loved the tomato sauce and cheese. It tasted fresh. The pizza was neopolitan style in my book... thin in the middle with a decent crust. The pizzas are individual sizes. I tried a bite of the BBQ chicken pizza and it was very tasty as well. It was great finishing our pizza and immediately enjoying a cup of gelato. This is some of the best I've had around town. Yes, free tasters. Seems like they have a bar also and serve top notch coffee. Haven't bought anything from the bar and I don't drink coffee. (Oh, and there's parking in the back and a parking garage across the street)."}
{"text":"Great place for a gelato treat.  The establishment is run by a very nice, very quiet couple. Service is impeccable, the restaurant is spotless, and the gelato flavors are superb.  I would definitely return to eat here again."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times and have yet to try it, although I've heard great things. We finally went last night and I was in gelato heaven. So many choices and all were delicious. I got the coconut and it was by far the best gelato I've had."}
{"text":"Sometimes people ask you, \"Where is the best coffee spot in town?\"   Sure, some people can name their fancy places and the coffee bigots will utter starbucks, but my answer is consistent: \"The best coffee I've had in these United States is at a tiny little Gelato place in Scottsdale, Arizona.\" 

 While the gelato is definitely excellent, the experience comes to fruition  in an effervescent manner  when you combine it with a hot cup of delicious Pascucci coffee this place serves.  It's an Italian coffee, that for whatever odd reason, I haven't seen served anywhere else.    

Often times, many Marriott hotels will serve the Italian brand of \"illy\"  [Also excellent but not as good as this], but the Pascucci proves to be elusive. 

 Last time I was in Phoenix, I dragged some coworkers on a 20 minute drive to have coffee and Gelato at this location.  With that much hype, you'd think no way this lives up to expectation.  This place did.  

 If you happen to be in Scottsdale, give it a try.  If you're on a diet, put it on hold, and have yourself a giant mound of delicious gelato and Pascucci coffee.   Go with some good friends.  Your taste buds will appreciate it, and for less than 10 Dollars, you can have a slice of some of the best things in life over conversation with a few good friends."}
{"text":"Had pizza and salad here with my wife on our recent trip to Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The pizza was delicious as well as the large salad we shared. Then we followed up with their gelato. I've been to Italy a number of times and always get chocolate gelato everywhere I go there. When I try to find the same quality and flavor of chocolate gelato in the US I find it near impossible to find. But this shop hits it spot on! This place has chocolate gelato that tastes just like the real thing in Italy. It's based on dark chocolate so don't expect it to taste like milk chocolate ice cream. Being a gelato, the flavor will be bold. This place delivers on that!!  I would definitely recommend you stop here for some great pizza and then some gelato!!!"}
{"text":"Hey what do you know , I love this Gelato Spot almost as much as all the other ones!   It has yummy flavors that make me happy."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this place stays open late and is in a great location in Oldtown Scottsdale.

Stopped hear late last Friday after a little shopping and dinner.  Picked up a small cup of vanilla bean and promptly devoured it.

If gelato is your thing this is the place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the friendliest staffs I've encountered. They have a large variety of flavors if you're looking for a gelato fix and if you're indecisive like I am, they will help you pick out flavor combinations based on your flavor pallet."}
{"text":"Saw this place the other day while walking around old town and we decided to stop and pick up some ice cream. So glad we did! We visited Italy on our honeymoon and we we're obsessed with Gelato. This place was one of the best gelato places we've had here in the states. Even the store looks closest to a gelato spot in Italy (with the huge selection of flavors). My husband had the cookies and cream and I had the chocolate hazelnut. They were both delicious! I can't wait to be back on that side of town to pick up some delicious Gelato!"}
{"text":"We've been to this particular location several times now and it's never been a let down!  Went this weekend while they were having an Art Show in the area and cooled off and enjoyed the people watching after walking around for a couple of hours. They have a good variety of flavors for just about every person's taste and they also share the space with a pizzeria that looks like they serve up some pretty tasty food, although we haven't tried that out just yet. 

There is also a bar upstairs that looks like a new addition to the space and would be worth a look when we are back in old town.  We will for sure be revisiting them for gelato anyways!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better gelato places in Scottsdale. it's perfect for Day tonight if you're looking to have pizza and ice cream and it's affordable."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST if in old town area! Not only do they have incredible gelato but an amazing pizza and hot sub menu! I highly recommended the American pizza and then finish with the a classic strawberry gelato. I wish I worked in the area do I could hold my team meetings here because they have an awesome layout with enough table space to fit 10+ people! As an AZ native this place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Gelato is one of those things that makes up for a crappy day or a long week.  It also makes a great night out even better.  The Gelato spot has so many delightful flavors, from the rich and decadent chocolate varieties to the tangy fruity flavors.  You can sample the flavors to find the one which suits your mood best or you can stick to what you know you love.

Service is usually friendly and fast, but there are the usual girls behind the counter who look and act like they would rather be anywhere else.  Fortunately, I have had more good experiences with these girls than bad.

Gelato... it's like a hug for your tongue!"}
{"text":"Love the gelatos and the pizza. The  ambiance is really good too. I like to sit on the patio and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I ordered to go - pizza; side salad; triple scoop.  At $25 this was a MAJOR OUCH!!

The food was ready and picked up within 10 minutes.

PIZZA - a soggy mess.  It is a small size by most restaurant measurements in NY style, to pick up a slice whole could not be done without it falling apart.  It obviously wasn't appetizing and flavor wise was a massive BLEAH.

SIDE SALAD - largely consisted of chop lettuce, with two small tomatoes, two carrot slices and some shave cheese added.

Three scoops were packed together in the same container, three very different favors that unfortunately were just okay.

Can't imagine coming back or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"We love this place so much we had our daughters one year birthday here.  She took great care of us and made sure everything was perfect.  The gelato is awesome.  My favorite is the coconut.  Mai, the owner, is a gem.  The real treat though, is the pizzas!  Grab a glass of wine and a capricciosa or a spicy pepperoni and chill on the enclosed deck.  Soooo good."}
{"text":"Wow! What a cool spot! Coffee? Brick over pizza? Gelato? All in one spot! What a clever idea... We didn't have any coffee or pizza but we did try almost every gelato there, and the employee was happy to help us out in doing so. They also have sugar free options if you need that. I know this sounds silly to mention, but the restrooms were spotless. I always pay attention to restrooms when I got somewhere, in my mind if they can't keep the restrooms that are open to the public clean what does that have to say about their kitchens?"}
{"text":"The Gelato Spot has beyond amazing food, and I definitely can't complain.  However,  their service is below average, and that's the only reason I have rated them lower. Every single time I have been there the food I call in is NEVER ready. They always tell me it will be 15-20 minutes when I call in, so I time it so I get there in the time alloted. I have learned that it typically won't be ready, so I will wait the entire 20 minutes before I even start driving over. Every time I arrive the food hasn't even been started! This last time I came in, the same exact thing, the food hadn't even been started, but in addition to that, they were out of bacon and prosciutto (which was on all three sandwiches I ordered). It would have been nice if someone would have told me before I showed up, or maybe even called back. The worst part is I waited an additional  25 minutes on top of my \"quoted\" time!!! At that point I figured they would have offered free gelato... but instead i got a $4 pizza card for the inconvenience,  which was at the register for anyone to grab. I don't think I will return after the continuous lack of service. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, so it's about time I wrote a review.  The service is great, the location is spacious, and the indoor and outdoor seating options are all really nice.  The best part, though, is the delicious gelatto!  Gelato Spot has the richest, tastiest gelato I've had.

The Bacio flavor is delightful! Chocolate and hazelnut? Yes, please!  Over the years, I've tried almost all of their flavors, and they've all been wonderful.  This is a place where I've gone with friends and family, and everyone is always impressed."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad about this place.  Tons of gelato flavors that are delicious.  I had a carmel brownie flavor and a second flavor of very berry.  Both great.  We also got a chocolate coconut one that was very good.  That coffee isn't bad either.  Clean, simple, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lots of options with most being gluten free. Very good tasting."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best selection of gelato I've ever seen. Sample away--they're happy to help!  Get one, two, three scoops or more!  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time tonight after dinner with my former roomie. How is it i've lived in the valley 5yrs and not been to this place yet?? Oh yeah, i forgot... I don't really care for ice cream. But this is where i was mistaken, cuz gelato is not ice cream! There were so many flavors... I think i made the girls behind the counter a lil batty with my indecision and fawning over the potential flavor combinations... I finally settled on a choc-dipped waffle cone with Caramello and Tiramisu flavors. Yum. Yum. Yum!  I promise i will try a different flavor next time, but it will be hard to resist that Tiramisu... I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is smack dab in the middle if Old Town Scottsdale on the main drag of Scottsdale Road.

I was thinking tha t this was mainly a large array of Gelato flavors to choose from; boy was I wrong! The menu was loaded with pizzas, sandwiches, salads and much more.

I opted for a sausage and peppers Pannini sandwich. May I say that the bread they used for this was fantastic! It's thin and tender and makes it a delight to eat.

The peppers and sausage had that old Italian feel and were seasoned just right. I sat in front of the restaurant that looks put my right on Scottsdale Road. It is a great observation platform for watching the many interesting people the take to the streets here.

I didn't have the Gelato when I was here. However, there were a plethora  of options to choose from. The facility is super clean and my service was excellent. I will be back soon for that Gelato! This was a great stop for lunch. Try it for yourself and see...

{"text":"Right on the cup it states \" Made fresh daily\" Our Gelato was not fresh at all!!! It had a old or freezer burnt taste. Very disappointing!!! Go to Frost in Gilbert for real Fresh Gelato!"}
{"text":"It's getting toasty in AZ and when it does, my ice cream addiction starts acting up. I've lived near the Old Town Gelato Spot for a couple of years and I like to feed my addiction here. What I like about this Italian ice cream shop is that not only does it have endless flavors of Gelato, it's also a tasty coffee shop equipped with Internet access, breakfast, beverages and frozen sweets. You can also order Gelato cakes for parties or if you're really craving ice cream and a cup just won't do. 

Gelato Spot opens bright and early in the morning, but you're not forced to have Gelato for breakfast. I've tried their breakfast sandwich and fruit/granola combo and both are excellent. Their coffee selection is hearty and they even have Italian sodas on hand. But, mostly I heart the Gelato Spot for their creamy and delicious Gelato. It's equivalent to the Gelato I've had in Italy and they even throw in a tasty cookie with every cup. 

Whether I'm there to lounge for a little bit or do some work, the atmosphere is always welcome and friendly. I'm sure I'll be a regular there this summer."}
{"text":"Having just returned from Italy a month ago I've been avoiding pizza because pizza here just can't compare to what we had in Italy. We decided to stop here for lunch and we split a margarita pizza. It was actually really good. Super thin crust, really good flavor. We had gelato afterwards which doesn't really compare to what we had in Italy but that doesn't seem possible here and it was still ok. Staff here were really friendly. This guy brought his kid in for gelato while we were eating and it was the kid's 3rd birthday so they went all out making his gelato special - even found a birthday candle and put it in there for him. It's always nice to see people taking great care of their customers and these guys did a great job! We'll come back!"}
{"text":"I don't get the buzz about this place.. on my visit all three scoops I had (Stracciatella, Hazel Nut and Pistachio) were icy and lacked any sort of flavor punch. Ya know how can you fuck up the classics, right? Plus the guy behind the counter looked more interested in texting than scooping. 

Maybe I was there on an off night? It was towards closing time, perhaps the gelato was a bit on the old side? Ill try again at some point.."}
{"text":"Great gelato
Great location
Great service
It's just great!

Don't miss this spot, it's perfect for tasty treats."}
{"text":"after a rather disappointing meal at el hefe, we headed for dessert over at the gelato spot. always a bright spot, the smell of coffee and gelato wafting away our sadness. 

i had the p-butter and cheese cake and it was so yummy. i could just eat gelato for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. and the staff here is always so pleasant and helpful. how many buckets of free samples must they give out a day? awesome place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gelato spot since the day this location opened.  And it's been wonderful, until tonight. Now don't get me wrong, their gelato is top notch.  The atmosphere has always been relaxed and light.  Tonight I'm on a date, we have our scoops and sit on the patio.  We finish and are chatting and all of a sudden a server is kicking us out of our seats.  There is no sign \"restaurant only\" or \"see hostess\", there are tables outside, why kick us out?  This place has become so disjointed now that it includes a pizza joint.  Make up your mind, either first come first served at all of your tables, or be more clear about your seating.  Instead you had to be rude to some customers going to a gelato place to get gelato instead of pizza."}
{"text":"Just stopped for ice cream. Very good, very creamy, but overpriced for such a small scoop ($4). Not crowded, but not empty as it is also a restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Would recommend if hungry for a small, but rich in flavor dessert."}
{"text":"I'm not huge on gelato, but I definitely recommend their Salted Calamari and Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie :)"}
{"text":"I liked the Gelato Spot, although its not the best gelato that I have had but its not that bad either. Also the nickname of 'the G spot' kinda grosses me out. The decor/design of the place is way cool, the staff seems to think they are to good to be serving others, but whatever. I recomend this place if you are in the area but not worth any kinda trek."}
{"text":"Oh Foursquare, what's this? Check in and get a free scoop of gelato? Don't mind if I do.

With a deal like this, you'd think that The Gelato Spot would be hurting for business, but nope, the place was packed, and with good reason. The gelato is creamy, the venue is clean and large, and the servers are extremely nice. Ask for samples. I got the strawberry and was definitely impressed."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident yesterday while walking in Old Town. Immediately checked it on Yelp and saw it had a great rating, and then we found out why.The gelato here was excellent, and we have had our share of gelato in many places. Flavor choices were very good. Some flavors like Samoa and Roche I had never seen. I had Samoa and my husband had the Roche, which was delicious and tasted like hazelnut. Would definitely go back there to try another flavor or even the pizza we saw being made that looked great."}
{"text":"Verdict: Wow. That's a lot 'o gelato!

I've tried two gelato places in this area of Scottsdale and this one is my favorite for the plentiful options. I like the other place's authenticity but flavor selection wins. See the pictures and you'll know what I mean.

I got the Chocolate Caramel Fudge Brownie with brownie pieces throughout. There wasn't a a strong caramel flavor but I wasn't complaining. The gelato had plenty of rich dark chocolate taste. 

Recommend trying a few flavors before making a choice. There were a couple of others that looked and sounded very good. Those just didn't have as much going for them as the fudge brownie."}
{"text":"*edited. 
Thx for such a quick reply on fixing the hole in the parking lot. Definitely bumps the place up to 5 stars. Looking forward to returning & relaxing over a cold treat in this heat!  


Always delicious! I do miss the groupons. Fun treat for my daughter :) 
Please fix the huge pothole right when you step off the curb though. My little girl tripped & fell pretty hard & got a huge gash on her knee last time we went. I carried her back in with blood running down her leg & the young girls behind the counter just looked at us blankly as I carried her to the restroom to clean up. I'm in the restaurant business and I expected them to at least offer napkins or be sympathetic!"}
{"text":"The gelato is great, but the pizza was awful.  2nd worst I've ever had. The sauce tasted like very watered down tomato soup, I asked for extra cheese and got very little cheese at all, it was just terrible. They really should just stick to coffee and gelato."}
{"text":"I just placed an order for a 12 inch Pepperoni and sausage pizza. I have never come across a more rude person while placing an order for anything in my entire life. She would not let me get a word in, she was talking to someone else near her as I was placing my order, kept distracting me and I had to repeat every I said 3 times. The phone was so far away from her mouth I could hear a word she was saying. I hope this pizza is not as bad as her customer service skills. It took 5 min to place an order for one pizza."}
{"text":"Great staff - super friendly and gave me all the samples I want.
Wonderful flavors - very flavorful, great variety, plenty of specialty flavors.
Comfortable environment."}
{"text":"The gelato was fair ... Actually overly sweet.  And the pizza a complete rip off.  $12 for a small spinach artichoke white pizza.  Flavor low, toppings next to none, and bland.  To make things worse it's run by rude teenagers.  You would be much better off with a microwave pizza and a pint of gelato from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Chea took very good care of us.  We are visiting family here and will definitely go back when we return."}
{"text":"Gelato wa sjust the right amount of creamy and sweet. I really only liked their roasted almond, bacio, roche and hazelnut, though. The olive oil was disappointing but that's why I didn't get it! For ~$5, I thought it was a good deal and well worth it in the Scottsdale heat."}
{"text":"Homemade gelato, Pascucci coffee, and now delicious salads, panini and wood-fired pizzas... this G spot really has it all!

I was hesitant when I learned that the Gelato Spot in Old Town was coming out with pizzas and salads, but after my lunch there today, I'm completely sold!  I was there with Lindsey F, so I have a feeling she'll be updating her review soon too, but I wanted to beat her to it, so here it is.

We shared the chicken louie wedge salad (iceberg wedge, chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, bacon, chives, avocado, champagne vinegarette, blue cheese crumbles, louie dressing, grana padano) although opted to get it minus the chives and blue cheese, and the american pizza (di napoli Tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, tuscan olive oil, grana padano) with mushrooms.  Both were delicious!  

Seriously, the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident... I cleaned the salad plate and ate my fair share of pizza too... We learned that this type of pizza is an art, and the pizza chef came from another well-known wood burning pizza place in town.  It was cooked just right and we were told it's best right out of the oven, so plan on dining in if you can.  Warning - the pepperoni really does have a kick!  

I love the fast-casual ordering system (order at the counter and then your food will be brought to you).  Prices are reasonable ($9 for our huge salad and $10 for the pizza).  I may have to go for a panini next visit as they look pretty awesome too, and there is a huge selection with hot and cold choices ranging from Italian grilled cheese, veggie, sausage & peppers, turkey, tuna, and more!

I enjoyed my  lunch so much that I forgot to save room for gelato, so I suggest saving a spot in your belly (a g-spot so to speak) when you go.  Buon Appetito! ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I, enjoyed the pizza and the gelato... We were there on New Years Eve, the service was great!!!"}
{"text":"I had a late night hunger for frozen yogurt at 10:30 PM and after looking for open places, I decided upon The Gelato Spot. Sure, it's not frozen yogurt... it's much better.

There was a big selection of interesting, delicious sounding flavors; I decided upon the almond Snickers.

My gelato was awesome. The texture was creamy and there was chocolate and caramel swirls with chocolate and almond pieces.  I love Snickers and although it did not remind me of a Snickers bar, it had great flavors and I had no complaints.

I also enjoyed the pirouette, it added a good crunch to the dessert.

Great place, super tasty, eat with their little spoon, and savor the flavors... it's a little on the pricey side (in my opinion). But, this may be the going rate for quality gelato."}
{"text":"Ehhh it's okay just not something I would come back for. Pizza was ehh and sauce was watery not much flavor either. Service was okay I had to ask for a refill on my water."}
{"text":"The salad I got was pretty gross. The focaccia bread was good. The gelato was worth it. 

I wish they were able to offer the \"Gelato Wars\" flavors year round. One of the staff brought me out a taste of caramel corn and it was amazeballs. They still have a huge selection of standard flavors that are all delicious. I got a large and nibbled on it for three days so the portion sizes are generous. Considering it's right across the street from the hotel I always stay at I'll definitely be back.

{"text":"Original review on top, 1 year later at the bottom: 
Oh man this was good stuff. We stopped on our way to the airport looking to satisfy our sweet tooth before the bitter TSA experience we were about to experience (Don't touch my junk bro!). 

The staff was very helpful, we probably sampled 6 or 7 flavors between the two of us, and they never batted an eye. They were helpful in suggesting flavors, and flavor combinations. I don't think I tasted a single one I wouldn't have thoroughly enjoyed eating a whole scoop of. But once we finally settled on our two flavors each, we realized why no one cared if we had a few samples; When you charge $10 for 2 (very small) cups of ice cream, you can afford to give away a lot of samples :)

So yes, it is very expensive, but yes it is also very tastey. We'll be back :)

Update almost 1 year later: Dropped to 3 stars. We went back! I'm not sure if the pizza was a new addition since we were there last, or if we were just so Gelato driven last time that we didn't even notice it. But in either case, this time I decided to pick up a pizza to take back to the hotel room with me. I like fru fru pizzas with the oddball ingredient combinations, etc, so this looked right up my alley, however I couldn't really find a good combination of toppings. I did a little customization, and 10 minutes later I was on the way back to the hotel room with Gelato and Pizza! Unfortunately by the time I got back to my hotel room, which was no more than a mile or two away (5 minutes tops), the pizza was soggy. I can appreciate a thin crust pizza, but this was like eating sauce and toppings on a soggy cracker. The crust just instantly turned to mush. Even rolling it up into the (tough) outer edge crust barely worked. I basically ended up just eating the pizza with a spoon (literally! since thats all I had in the hotel room). If I read that they have improved their crust, I'd go back for pizza, otherwise they should stick to the gelato :)"}
{"text":"The gelatos was really mediocre here and had some artificial sweeteners in it that just kept building and building until you couldn't taste the gelato.  We were just trying to find some really good ice cream instead of going to the Sugar Bowl which was packed"}
{"text":"Great dessert choice!  In the hustle and bustle of the Old Town in Scottsdale, this is the perfect place to finish an evening with a tasty Gelato that has the feel of a little slice of Italy.  The woman that owns the place is very professional and direct and does a great job keeping this place running like a well, oiled machine.  I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Entree: Honey Basil Pizza
Delicious pizza with the sweet and savory combination. Thin thin crust. One pizza is a perfect serving for one person. 

Dessert: Mint Chocolate Chip Gelato
Basically a girl scout cookie turned into gelato. They have 30+ flavors and a few seasonal ones. 

Service: unbelievably slow, especially since it was myself and one other person. It took 20 minutes to get my check, another 15 to get my card back.

I'm the type of person that can never choose the type of pizza I want, so I always ask to make it half and half. I was told absolutely not an option. I was on my way out and overheard the table next to me order a pizza with a half and half combo and the same waitress agreed to it! How was that fair? Major disappointment that the group next to me go better service than I did.

The menu itself is great, lots of great options for lunch and dinner. I really liked the indoor/outdoor seating. They have a coffee and wine bar. The coffee smelled unbelievably delicious and I was sitting across the restaurant from the bar. 

Overall, great food, dessert, and vibe."}
{"text":"This gelato shop not only have gelato but also food! 

We were here only to try the gelato. If you are unsure about which flavor to get, ask for a free sample of the flavor! I got the almond snicker and I loved it! There were many seating areas if you wanted to enjoy your gelato while sitting. 

Overall, I would come back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique flavors! 

After some Mexican food, my friend and I decided to cool down at Gelato Spot.  The staff members are friendly, and you can get samples of any of the gelato.  The scoops are rather large! The single scoop was enough! 

The parking could be an issue, as it's in a popular area of Scottsdale.   The prices are a bit steep, but the gelato is high quality.  

The seating areas include a roomy area with large windows overlooking Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"My go-to ice-cream shop in old-town scottsdale would definitely have to be G-spot. All the staff are very friendly, especially Kristin! Kristin has the best customer service I have seen in the longest time, in any business. She makes it a point to talk to every one of her customers, get to know them, and you actually get to know her. She's not just another server. She is quick on her feet, gets every order right, and makes it a great experience to study, eat, chat, snack, drink coffee anything there! 

Gelato has a wide variety and selection of ice-cream, with all of your favorites in one place: coffee, pizza, ice-cream, beer, home made sangria, real shaved chocolate for your coffee, sandwiches, etc. 

It's trendy, and is a great get-to-know-your-date spot! Awesome atmosphere.

Not enough parking, but that's nothing compared everything else! It's a great spot."}
{"text":"It's fresh, the flavors are always changing, you get to sample the flavors, and they have good service.  We loved the coffee-flavored gelato.  The chocolate is rich.   Our friends enjoyed the mint and the stracciatella.  We went back again for more, too.  You should def. go there."}
{"text":"Having visited Italy twice, this pizza tastes like cardboard. For the price you are paying, you might as well go somewhere else for some flavor. I love the layout and the atmosphere, but the service is definitely lacking. We were helped by an older lady, she may have been the manager, but she was rude and it seemed she was only interested in making sure we'd order something expensive to make it worth her while."}
{"text":"So goood! I could eat this every night. :) the gelato has a great texture and flavor."}
{"text":"I went here last night and regret not going somewhere else.
My family and I were in the mood for pizza and came here to try it out.
We first ordered the trio app and it's not worth $10. 5 pieces or burnt pizza crust and small dipping sauces in plastic cups. 
When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but had no taste to it. The crust was soggy and the topping came right off. I really wanted pizza but this place was a big let down."}
{"text":"It is nice to see that the owner of the place is always on top of things and makes sure the place runs as it should.
Great customer service a the Gealto bar, and great Gelato as well."}
{"text":"Thanks to Gabi M. I have another spot to add to my list of Phoenix faves! This place serves up light and delicious Italian fare in addition to coffee and Gelato. The service was friendly and casual and great for those on a time crunch because you can order at the counter, grab a seat and wait to be served!

On this visit we both ordered the Focaccia Chop salad with chicken. With the Arizona heat in full effect crisp salads are what I crave most, and that salad sure hit the spot! The mix of Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, wood roasted corn, diced cucumber carrots and avocado was heavenly. The champagne vinaigrette added a hint of sweetness that blended nicely with Grana Padano cheese that was served over the greens. The best part was that the salad was served over their fresh oven baked Focaccia bread! It was almost like a pizza salad and I enjoyed every bite!

In addition to delicious food and generous portions, the prices are super reasonable! I don't think I saw anything on the menu that was over $10.95. As I waited for my salad,  I read over their other menu offerings and I will for sure come back for a taste of their wood-fired pizza, panini and Gelato!"}
{"text":"This location was great!  We have been to other Gelato Spot locations and they were all good stops, and this one takes it to the next level by adding pizza and other menu offerings to the mix.  We didn't realize that this was something that they offered prior to going, so we had already eaten a regular meal, however, the salads and pizzas that were at the table next to us were a definite temptation to return and give them a go!  

Overall: A 
Same great gelato and service of their typcial spots, but interested in giving the food a try next go 'round!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a Groupon last year, we found this spot and have visited a few times since then.  Having never been to Gelato Spot, we didn't know what to expect.  We've driven by it dozens of times and it appeared to be a small joint that served Gelato.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly to find a restaurant that offered much more than Gelato.

Menu items we've ordered during our visits:

Spicy Pepperoni Pizza (Di Napoli Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Spicy Pepperoni, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.50

Classic Pizza (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Grana Padano, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.95

Sausage & Peppers Panini (Hot Italian Sausage, Wood Fired Onions, Roasted Red Peppers, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Tuscan Olive Oil, Grana Padano), $7.95

Grilled Cheese Panini (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Provolone, Gorgonzola, Fresh Tomato, Hint of Honey), $5.95

Gelato & Sorbet, $3.99 ea
Raspberry
Cookies n Cream
Tiramisu

The Pizzas are by far my favorite menu item.  They're really good.  I didn't expect to find that in a Gelato joint!  The Panini's are ok, the Sausage & Peppers Panini was too soggy.  The Grilled Cheese Panini was good.

The Gelato & Sorbet is awesome.  Raspberry and the Cookies n Cream are my 2 favorite.  You can sample as many as you like before you buy, that's what I like to do! :)

Overall, it's a nice casual restaurant to visit.  It's order/pick up at the counter, limited service, but the food is great.  The worst part about coming here is the parking.  There's a tiny parking lot with a handful of spots in the back of the building.  If that's full, you'll have to park down the street, which isn't very convenient...especially during the blazing hot Summer.

Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"What? No Malibu-flavored gelato? Well, they do have coconut so yay for me! Everyone is always very nice here, and patient too! Especially when you bring in an indecisive teenager who goes through 20 spoons of sampling. 

Reasonably priced, and the new decor is nice. Miss the old patio, though. It was nice sitting outside in the fall. 

Their wood-fired pizzas are good. But can be hit or miss. Ask them for a crispy crust and it won't be undercooked and soggy like some people complain about. I like the Primavera (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Arugula, Prosciutto, Olive Oil, Shaved Grana Padano) and the Esotica (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Fresh Pineapple, Italian Ham, Basil, Tuscan Olive Oil). LOVE IT!! 

If you're thinking of going on a weekend, order ahead online! It will save you time in line and the headache of waiting! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review, for those of you that take gelato very seriously, by stating that I've never had gelato from Italy, I do not consider myself a gelato expert, nor have I received any certifications, degrees or accolades on the subject of gelato tasting.

Now that that's out of the way... I thought the gelato was excellent. I couldn't choose between vanilla bean and caramello, so I ended up getting two flavors (and believe me, narrowing it down to two took a while as they have a lot of enticing flavors).

Oh yes, and after dealing with the prices at Coldstone for a few years now it was a welcome relief and pleasant surprise that gelato for two only cost about $6."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing Gelato. I have been there plenty of times and I always make sure that anytime I have friends or family visiting that we make a trip. They have plenty of flavors to choose from. 

I was there this past Monday with my sister. We met an employee named Nelson, who was also a fellow New Yorker. After talking to him and experiencing his amazing customer service I can honestly say that this is the type of employee every boss wishes for. Nelson was super friendly and made us feel so comfortable and welcome there. I love leaving an establishment with that feeling. I plan on visiting more often now. Thanks Nelson!"}
{"text":"When in Italy a few years ago, I ate Gelato everyday (and one day even twice). So, it was not even a question of if we would stop here, only when. Here on vacation for a few days and my boyfriend decided to show me around downtown Scottsdale. It was late and most places in the downtown were closed, so we hit the Gelato Spot for a little dessert. 

This place is clean and cute and pretty close to the downtown area. The staff are very attentive and greet you when you come in. They are happy to give you samples of anything and everything you want. I feel guilty trying too many, but I made sure to try a few. I could not believe the number of choices. It seemed like far more than there ever were at the gelato stops in italy and the few that stops I have been to in my area too. LOTS OF CHOICES. Some that I have seen before and a handful of new ones. I opted to try the pumpkiin nad the oatmeal raisin. Both were delicious. So I got the oatmeal raisin and my boyfriend got the pumpkin and vanilla. That way, I get to have both without ordering a double. 

YUMMY!!! Great quality gelato. Great Service. Super cute place with inside couches and outside patio. Seems like it would be perfect on a hot AZ summer day!"}
{"text":"Cute little gelato shop not too far from the restaurants and bars in Old Town, great stop after a nice dinner or quick lunch. I've never been disappointed by their vast selection of flavors and my boyfriend loves the little cookies/pirouettes that come with them! Will be back again."}
{"text":"The shakes are amazing here, its so hard to pick a flavor! I'm excited to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic gelato. Enjoy as many samples as you desire!  This gelato has the consistency of American ice cream, but it's packed with more flavor. Much more flavor. 

Memorable flavors include NY cheesecake, almond snickers, almond, mango, banana, forest berry, and birthday cake. The cheesecake tastes EXACLTY like the real thing--delicious!  Every cup comes with a pirouette--very unique!  

My only gripe:  You can't purchase two flavors in a small cup. Only medium.  Not that I'm complaining about having MORE scrumptious gelato...

Sit on the patio, enjoy your gelato, maybe some espresso...a very pleasant way to escape."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I was pleasantly surprised with this spot! My partner and I were craving some ice cream and find this plan just around the corner from our hotel. After a nice stroll, we ended up here and we're pleasantly greeted by the employees. I was also rather excited that they open so late. They didn't close until midnight. Thank god for that!! I'm glad they accommodate the late night cravers. The place is conveniently located in a corner location within a pizzeria. It is one in the same. The location is clean and the place is quaint and comfortable. Employees are great! They are friendly and pleasant. The guy behind the gelato counter was very helpful and friendly. He helped us decide what flavors mixed well with others. He also allowed us to taste nearly all the flavors! I ended up getting a scoop of the cheesecake and a scoop of the strawberry! Oh my goodness! It hit the spot. It really tasted as though I was chomping down on a real strawberry cheesecake! I saw a decent amount of customer flow and the employees were constantly making gelato in the back. You could tell that it was freshly made and it doesn't stay out too long. I am so happy that we found this spot and if I ever come back, I will be sure to pay this mountain of deliciousness a visit!!! It will not fail you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an ice cold, sweet treat. Collectively we tried, cookies & cream, salted caramel, chocolate chip (stracciatella) & butter pecan, with & without waffles cones. It's the perfect late afternoon treat without ruining your supper! The cones are yummy enough to eat alone & the gelato is creamy perfection. There's also a pizza oven & a coffee bar (with a variety of liqueurs), both of which smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Yeah Yeah Yeah.. This place has been covered so many times, but I come here all the time.  I have had better gelato back east so it is not the best.. but it is damm good and it is a great place in olde town to catch some ice cream.


If you are in the hood of olde town and have someone on your arm this is a great place to take them for a treat."}
{"text":"Piss poor... got a delivery this evening off of grub hub and I'm from Boston, on vacation staying at the Hilton. Received an ice COLD pizza after a little bit over an hour wait.  I'm starving, and called the person who delivered the pizza back since the restaurant is \"closed\" and he said id have to dispute it w grub hub as it was not \"his fault\" what a fun evening when all a girl wants on vacation is a little late night PIZZA.  Would never recommend to anyone in the area and i have plenty of friends who are in and out of the area all year."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever! I just love this place. They have about 30 flavors of the best gelato in Scottsdale. The service is super helpful. Free samples of anything. I always get the salted caramel. I always want to get something else but I always come back to this."}
{"text":"I tried a pizza at this place and it's Amazingly fresh, it's truly wood fired. It tastes so fresh and so perfect. I would say it's the best pizza I ever ate. And their customer service is Amazing. I am very thankful!"}
{"text":"Great little Gelato spot. Didn't get a chance to try the wood fire pizza because the hostess led me upstairs to the whiskey bar, oh Darn!  But on the way out I had to stop in for some gelato. The chocolate Carmel brownie and pistachio were great!  Made the walk back to the Aloft nice and cool!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. I ordered a spicy pepperoni pizza and while cooking it they made the bottom too thin so the pizza got a hole in it. They came by to tell me it would take a little bit longer and offered to give me the broken pizza as well as the new one once out of the oven. My only question is: why don't they make any reference to their pizza outside the restaurant? You wouldn't know that pizza was half their business unless you went inside."}
{"text":"Our first time having wood fired pizza and we thoroughly enjoyed it. the staff was very friendly and helpful, the vibe of the place was perfect. time to enjoy our gelato, great place to relax."}
{"text":"The gelato was awesome!!  Some of the best I've had!!  Sexy dulce, fire ball and butter pecan were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Good compliment after a Delux Burger (hahah not really). I tried their pocket coffe....great flavor!. I was just missing a good chocolate selection, but they do have the fancy flavors like roche, or gum, or snickers (which personally I don't even care to try). The place is nice and good service."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great gelato! The pepperoni is a little spicy but good. The bbq chicken was overflowing with chicken and bacon. Food came out quickly and the waitress was helpful and friendly. But the gelato was the star of the show. So many flavors - super creamy and rich! And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I come here for ice cream from time to time. I am not a fan of their ice cream. I call it ice cream and not gelato because they don't serve authentic gelato. Also their ice cream is not creamy and dense like gelato should be. They do offer a wide range of flavors which is one of the two reasons I keep going back. The second reason I stay a loyal customer is because it's in old town Scottsdale which is where I live."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  

The gelato is really good and comes in a ton of different varieties (though, never having had gelato in Italy, it probably tastes completely different) and it's reasonably priced ($3-4ish).     

Also, this place makes some pretty good coffee, too.  I would definitely stop by just for the espresso."}
{"text":"Amazing! One of my favorite places to go to when I wanted dessert! Highly recommended! Good customer service!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome..
me and my boyfriend came here twice we liked it so much..
we enjoyed the service since the guy was really cool and helpful..
and he was really patient with us..
i loved it.. the gelato is delicious..
i'd definitely come back here if i was in town."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews but for this occasion I must. I have always visited there camelback location and have always been satisfied. When I found out about this location I was very excited since it's very close to my job. I walked in during lunch hours it was pretty empty to my surprise. I bought my gelato and had a seat there. This gelato spot is actually in a restaurant so whole I was there I decided to try the pizza. Unfortunately, it took forever for anyone to even offer a menu I had to get up and ask for a menu. While I was there the cook making the pizzas kept starring at me like I was a piece of meat I felt very uncomfortable. One of the waitresses (I did not get her name but she was a brunette) went over by him and both started talking and both looked back at me as if they were talking about me. The blonde waitress was very nice though and noticed I was in a rush to get out of there. I don't think I would ever go back here."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Super fresh!  Fantastic dessert stop.  This is why you live on Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Disappointed. A few years ago I loved this place, haven't been in awhile and was super disappointed when I came back. My gelato had no flavor, wasn't smooth had ice crystals/more of a snow texture. And was way too expensive to not be awesome. Would rather go to cold stone."}
{"text":"I like what Dean writes below - \"super cute girls love gelato\"

Indeed, had my first visit here today and there were a lot of super cute girls enjoying the gelato. I had peanut butter, which tasted terrific. I could see this place being mobbed around post-dinner time on a Friday-Saturday in Old Town Scottsdale. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is my all time favorite for Gelato and Coffee. When I used work in old town I would make my trek down Scottsdale road on foot even on those hot summer days when cars pass you by just to bring excruciating gusts of hot desert air upon your back it was well worth it for their  iced lattes. 

Now I have discovered Affagoto, a large scoop of your choice gelato and fresh brewed espresso poured on top to create a delicious heart pounding  rush of caffeine and sugar. It feels like how one would feel when they fall in love for the first time, but this comes at only a $5 price and you can feel it all over again. 

The staff is great, courteous and very informative in making suggestions. 

Gelato Spot Thank you!"}
{"text":"Yammmy. Was walking back to my car after dinner when the bright sign lured me in. Hadn't been to a gelato shop in a long time so I was excited to peruse their flavors and get some dessert. Peppy employee let me sample to my heart's desire (just two flavors) and I ordered two: the Pockett coffee and the roche. Both good but the coffee was the real winner with chocolate chunks, so delicious. I wouldn't order the roche again but would do a classic chocolate. Their gelato displays are always so beautiful and they've got a great selection. I always go for chocolate so my choices are narrowed but they have fruity flavors and vegan options as well. It is on the pricier side but it's worth the splurge every once in a while."}
{"text":"Gelato Spot has great tasting food. Service is really great as well but I am a bit thrown off by the fact that I actually liked it being an order at the counter kind of place. Every time I go I order the cobb salad which is so amazingly delicious! This past weekend I gave the focaccia chop salad a shot. so simple and refreshing and I wish my homemade salads tasted that great. 

the focaccia at the bottom of the salad got so well covered in vinagrette that I just could not stand not eating every piece. Just go, enjoy it, pig out on some gelato after. Simple, good food"}
{"text":"Yes i highly recommend anyone with a fix for gelato to come to this location, fair prices and tons of delicious flavor selections"}
{"text":"Oh Gelato Spot... whenever I need something sweet and cold, you deliver! We came here after dinner the other night for a sweet treat. I always get the coffee and my husband gets the pistachio - this was no different. The employees were nice, friendly, and helpful. We were quick to get our treats and sat out on the patio. It was a really nice night and we enjoyed the ambiance. The parking lot was also relatively empty, so we were lucky. I've been here before and it was difficult to find a spot. There is a parking garage nearby, but I've never had to use it. Definitely check this place out! This location also does food and coffee/liquor. We'll have to come back and try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan!  The gelato is rich and smooth, the staff was really cool about giving out samples, and since I was there on a Saturday night, the people watching was prime -- lots of cougars and adam lambert look alikes.  

I got the chocolate caramel and the strawberry combined, it was truly sublime.  I shall return to the Gelato Spot!"}
{"text":"Plenty of samples of gelato, but the real star is the brick oven pizza. It actually tastes healthy, which is not how I usually describe pizza."}
{"text":"The gelato here is the best I've had in Arizona. They have a huge selection that you can sample from before you make your choice. Two of my favorites are the pistachio and also the mint chip.

I've never had the pizza here so I can't really speak on that. I just stick to the yummy gelato!"}
{"text":"I t was 112 here in Phoenix so we were looking for ice cream. Nice spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Lots of interesting flavor and decent size and price. The salted caramel was ok but the tiramisu was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for a treat while we were in the area. Great assortment of flavors and very friendly staff.
Since I work in the area, I plan on making this a regular spot to grab a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Its a great place to have a pizza!!! The waiters are awesome and the pizza makers are great too. They really care you having a great time at this place. Definitely would recommend for anyone to eat their pizza!!! The espressos and drinks are great. The price for the quality of food you get is great too."}
{"text":"Not only does this place serve pizza and coffee but gelato as well you can have a whole date here. The gelato was incredible, great flavor selection. Service was great they let me sample as many as I wanted. We had a good time here."}
{"text":"Delish...but then again, who doesn't like gelato?

I had the amarena (cherry) and it was quite tasty.  Smooth and creamy, just like I like my men.  :)

Definitely recommended when you want something sweet to finish off the meal.  Or when you are sweating balls in that nice, desert heat when August rolls around."}
{"text":"Gelatin is just one small step below what we get in Rome.   It's very  good dense not too sweet.   The flavors are just not as intense.   This is very good greats for the states. Espresso is very good as well.   Friendly staff."}
{"text":"When I'm not hitting up The Sugar Bowl in Old Town, I come over to the equally amazing G Spot. Yes yes that is what the locals and store owners call it, you'll have some fun with that one! Having tried Gelato in Italy, and becoming a quick addict, I was really excited when this chain popped up all over Scottsdale last year. I have to say, they got the Gelato right! Another thing I really like about the G Spot is the crazy amount of flavors to choose from. They offer a variety of fruit, European, and American choices which are all excellent. At my last visit I opted for a fruity mango and raspberry combo and I loved it! If you want some out of the box dessert definitely consider the G Spot, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"7/27/11

3.5 stars.

Took Mom here for her first visit and tried a couple of gelato dishes**.  The first was a \"sundae\" that consisted of two mini-scoops of roche and mango, with a chocolate crackle topping and some crushed almonds. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-gelato-spot-scottsdale-4?select=uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ#uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ  D'lish!  The second dish was a warmed brownie sundae, with a scoop of bacio gelato (chocolate-hazelnut gelato with chunks of dark chocolate).  Also quite good, but was made too rich with the addition of the chocolate syrup.  (I prefer rich and ever-so-slightly bitter ganache, or hot fudge as a topping, rather than sickeningly sweet and runny chocolate syrup.)  

**I stopped going to Gelato Spot when I noticed I was getting allergy symptoms afterwards (rashes, stomach aches, and worse symptoms, of which I will spare you the details- you're welcome)."}
{"text":"Great place to sit (on the patio) and enjoy coffee/gelato with someone, intimately -- if the weather permits. Really pleasant place to chill; music is good to boot!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to meet my girlfriend's for gelato and to catch up. They have really good flavors I like to try different combinations every time I go. I was skeptical when they started serving pizza but it's actually pretty good! They have water base gelato if you have any allergies to Dairy."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and walking around. The \"Wood fired Pizza\" sign caught my eye and I was instantly hooked.
I ordered the Honey Basil pizza (Honey, Goganzola, Basil) and my buddy ordered the American (Sausage, Pepperoni). Both Pizzas came out like soup.

Basil Honey - Great flavor. I assume it was the honey on mine but there was a pool of liquid in the center. Unfortunately this seepedto the bottom of the pizza after being cut by the kitchen before serving. So, naturally the crust was soaked with liquid making EXTREMELY messy to eat.

American - This one was also served with a pool of liquid but unfortunately grease. Naturally, any meat topped pizza will have some grease, but this, like the honey basil, was necessary to eat with knife and fork due to the grease soaked crust.

I'm giving 2 stars because I will not be going back. The service was great and received in a timely matter. The pizza had quality ingredients. However, when pizza is served with that much liquid, it's a no go for me."}
{"text":"(The most important, and only necessary part of a Yelp review...)

Good food.  Go here. 

You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Great Location! Nice and modern! 
Have to stop in for Gelato every time I'm in old town! My favorite is The Coffee!
Pizza is done right in front of you and cooked in their oven brick pizza! You can definitely feel the love that was put into this idea! And not to mention the service, from the pizza maker to the waitress were super friendly!

Also don't forget to grab some Molly water bottle on your way out!"}
{"text":"Wow!! That about covers it right there! Hadn't had gelato in a while and we stopped in for a treat. The counter was set up like a fine deli and all the goodies were arranged in a pleasing fashion. Of course, tasting was encouraged and I got a scoop of coconut and a scoop of Ferrero Roche....delish!!! Pleasant employees are always good to note too. :O)"}
{"text":"Silly me. With gelato tasting so great from here one would hope that the rest of the food would follow suit. Sorely, sorely (did I say sorely) disappointed. Ordered a pizza. Flavorless and cold. Ordered a panini. Also cold (flavor was a little too strong and not balanced well by a long shot). So even though the gelato is delicious, the other menu items lack that tier top 10 taste. A work in progress for this kitchen, one hopes. Here's cheering them on so they right their wrongs."}
{"text":"They had three vegan gelatos.  Not three sorbettos (of which they had an entire case full), but three rich and creamy gelatos, in chocolate, coffee, and flan(!).  So while all of my friends were excited to hit up the Sugar Bowl, I came here to cool down from the heat and enjoy a scoop of coffee gelato.

When they stuck a cookie straw into my scoop, I had to ask, \"Is this also vegan?\" \"Oh yeah, it's made with a water-based chocolate.\"  Might not be a good enough answer for some people, but it floated my boat.  Yay for gelato!  Yay for cookie straws!

It's everything you want gelato to be, without some other mama's milk."}
{"text":"I don't know if they are having an off day today, but my salad was totally screwed up.  

I got my usual salad order to go - the Cobb, with the champagne vinaigrette - with no cucumbers.  What I received was a salad that contained pieces of wilted spring mix thrown in with the regular romaine and spring lettuce, chicken (some pieces grilled perfectly, some burnt), 3/4 cup of cucumbers, bacon, blue cheese, and a warm hard boiled egg.  No Tomato or Chives made it on my salad.  

The wilted lettuce, burnt chicken pieces, and warm egg were a total turnoff.  And picking the cucumber out was a PITA.

I think it will be a while before I return here for lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best gelato places in the country. In the two best I've tried (I eat gelato everywhere I go). Love the pistachio and chocolate hazelnut (roche etc) flavors."}
{"text":"I always love coming here! We have been here more times than I can count. We live far away so every time we are on this side of town we always try and make it here. Love the gelato and the pricing is good too. We have had the pizza and it was alright but we always come here for the gelato and that deserves 5 stars! I love the cookie dough, salted caramel and raspberry! I usually do the raspberry with a salty combo (salted caramel or cookie dough) and that pairs so well!"}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would. This was absolutely the worst service I have ever received! Our waitress messed up our order 4 times. Unapologetic every single time. While trying to request the correct order multiple times we received attitude, smirks, and disrespect. When asking for a manager she refused to get one and attitudinally would not give her name. As a server myself and knowing how a restaurant works this was undeniably the worst service I've ever had and there is no excuse for this HORRIBLE customer service. PATHETIC."}
{"text":"I've been to Boston and NY and went to every pizza joint and had some of the best pizza I've ever had. This place shocked me when I bit into their Spicy Pepperoni pizza. It literally melted in my mouth. Who would have thought the best Pizza I've ever had was in Scottadale, AZ? I keep coming back. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise that I have walked right past this spot for years. Thank goodness for Groupon.I purchased a Groupon deal that encouraged me to try their food. We ordered 2 types of pizza, a side salad, and sampled some Gelato. Of course the Gelato was delish, but I can finally say I have found a place in Old town who makes a GOOD small salad that doesnt charge an arm & a leg. I am so glad to have finally found a good spot to eat, that is also open late. The only improvement I could see being made...delivery to local businesses :-)"}
{"text":"We traveled from southern Cal to Scottsdale, and the warm weather made us want to get some gelato!  The employees were really nice and let us try many samples.  Our favorites were lemon and mango flavors!  a nice stop before heading off to Sedona!"}
{"text":"For a late night pick me up, this is the place to go. They have a great beverage menu (alcoholic and non). Lori served us and she makes really amazing coffee drinks!  I got the iced Nutella latte and holy wow! It's a blend of hazelnut and almond syrups with a little chocolate I think. It was definitely one of the best tasting coffees I've had in quite a while. The coffee they used was really smooth and fresh. There was no bitter aftertaste that you frequently get with certain coffee shops. I think this business is connected in some way to the Second Story Liquor Bar located above them. We were waiting for a table upstairs to have a drink and Lori was very attentive. She gave us some details about the bar and showed us a menu. She also made sure that the hostess knew we were still waiting and helped us get seated after she found out we had been waiting an extra 15 minutes after the estimated wait time. Great place and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottdale. :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, The Gelato Spot loses a star just for it's old town Scottsdale location, but I was prepared to give them a solid 4 stars. As someone who lived in Sicily for years, I am pretty particular about my pizza, and gelato. I must say, the crust was amazing! The ingredients were authentic, and the gelato was top notch. Unfortunately, the service and decore left a lot to be desired. It seems ownership shot their wad on the prime location and wood burning stove, leaving nothing left for a quality staff. All staff members that night were high school girls, who had no concept of customer service. We were exposed to general complaints of having to work, why so and so can be late but they couldn't... on and on. Also, while preparing my gelato, a whole scoop was dropped into another flavors bin, which was quickly scooped up and put back into my container. gross. For authentic sicilian pizza, I give them 2 thumbs up. For all around experience, It was massively lacking.
UPDATE: I was quickly contacted by the owner, who was very interested in my experience, and wanted my opinion on how to better his business. I respect the hell out of that. I am upping my rating to 4 stars. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I could start with the order being wrong. Not once. Not twice. Not three times. But four damn times. The service was absolutely the worst service I've had in the past 20 years of my life. Our server did not apologize nor did she show any sympathy. Even though my family had already finished their meals and were ready to go by the time the fourth pie was finally done. When it was cooked, it was cooked so poorly. The dough still soft and the cheese barely melted on. I tried and tried again to give this service multiple shots, unfortunately I was let down. Not. Worth. Your. Time. We had to wait four ever. Order Pizza Hut and save yourself the time and energy of having to deal with this restaurant. I would however recommend this place if you personally enjoy having to repeat yourself half a dozen times and wait over forty five minutes for the correct order. N then continue to have to look the server in the face as she smirks while you inform her of the issues you'd experienced. To each their own, but personally I'm all set on an experience like this. Absolutely dreadful."}
{"text":"When I arrived in Scottsdale, I drove past this place on the way to my hotel. I knew I had to stop in and try their gelato ice cream. I was pleasantly surprised. They have so many flavors to choose from. I felt like I was in a gelato buffet :). 

I tried several but my favorite two were the cookies and cream and the olive oil. This place is very clean, has a great selection of gelato, and very relaxing and situated in the heart of old town Scottsdale. If you are looking for a cold gelato/ice cream this is your place."}
{"text":"I went here again this past weekend, Groupon in hand ($5 for $10) which is basically buy one get one free! Got banana and coffee and it was perfection.

What is exciting is I also got a white pizza with 3 types of cheeses and basil and honey. Most delicious thing in the world! highly recommended. 

The girl at the gelato counter also let us sample practically every single flavor while my friend and I waited for additional friends.....that's awesome!"}
{"text":"Best gelato! I drove past this place on Scottsdale road for the last 3 years I've lived down here & I finally tried it for the first time a few weeks ago & I've gone here now at least 4 times. The banana flavor is my favorite & so is the chocolate fudge brownie. It's my new favorite spot for ice cream!"}
{"text":"So, it happens to be quite WARM here in Arizona. 

Like, ya know...105 degrees. Only. Psssh. That's all you got desert!? Bring it on. I want to cook my eggs on the pavement. 

Ok, I don't really. And if it gets any hotter here, I'll quite possibly melt. I'm just not cut out for extreme heat, unless the pendulum swings the other way and it's 25 below zero. Layers. Many, many layers. 

I'm way off track. 

So, it's hot. That means, we must eat cold stuff. Like gelato. 

And the world (and my body temp) was righted by a small peanut butter gelato with a cute little chocolate stick. Super cool (pun intended) cafe, funky furniture, creative coffee concoctions, free wifi, friendly people...

Chillllllllll. I like. Dessert in the desert."}
{"text":"The Gelato Spot has been around for years at this location.  Many restaurants and come and gone, but not this place.  

Overall, I'm not really a fan of gelato and desserts in general.  However an occasional stop in to this place always does a body good.  Plus, I've got great memories here!  Local Chefs offering up their concoction of gelato at this location; which is pretty cool.  However, I'd say stick to cooking and leave the gelato making to the experts haha!  

The place itself is always updating and changing up new concepts.  I noticed a bar now serving up some coffee and an pizzeria upstairs.  In the end, that is why The Gelato Spot has kept up with the times.  Having the ability to evolve into a new restaurant yearly is a plus in my books - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved walking in and being greeted by a huge genuine smile and a beautiful atmosphere. (Reba) Never been here before but heard it was good pizza and it was lunch time. I'm not into gelato or desserts but dang the selection looked amazing. I tried the pineapple and ham lunch pizza. Made fresh in a brick oven pizza right over my shoulder. Tasted so fresh and I liked how they sliced the pineapple. The price was only $8 and it filled me up. I could have eatin more so if your a big eater you might go with bigger pizza.  That's good for the quality of the pie. The waitress and the other lady working seemed to be in such good moods. Just liked everything about this place. II will be back.  Ok. She talked me into trying the Gelato. And I'm now hooked. Haha."}
{"text":"So justifiable! 
A nice end to a good meal, or just to walk around old town and widow shop.
There's a lot of flavors, ask for tastes the help is great and didn't seem to mind if you couldn't make up your mind on the first five tastes. I ended up with the tiramasu, so good. 
Last word...satisfied."}
{"text":"Nice gelato shop that is part of a pizza/Italian restaurant. All the classic flavors are represented here nicely. The chocolate chip mint is great! I've heard that the pizza is ok, but the best thing about this place is the location. If you are with some friends at the sport bars just down the way you can walk to this location."}
{"text":"Nice flavors and a nice indoor patio to sit and people watch from.  Typical Scottsdale prices. Nothing wrong with this place except for a sort of sterile hipster Scottsdale feel to it. Honestly we prefer the old town charm of the Sugar Bowl better except for the people watching."}
{"text":"Awesome gelato, awesome location, friendly employees.  I would highly recommend the salted caramel flavor.  My only gripe is the price!  Around $4 for a single scoop, which is quite modest in size compared to some other places.  But now that I know about their promos and text rewards (thanks fellow yelpers) I will be back!"}
{"text":"Walking around Scottsdale on my break and decided to check out this place. It was slow so when I walked in no one was around to help me. I was very confused as to where I should go to order, they have 3 different counters for three different types of food items they serve. I wasn't sure if it was a Pizzeria, Gelato or coffee spot. They also had beer displayed. Someone finally came out of the back room (Asian Lady) carrying a dog!!!! Animals in the kitchen?? The other worker that came out of the back was scratching her head and touching cups etc... with out washing her hands. At that point I was disgusted and decided to leave.  This place is totally unhygienic and not following Health standards and laws. There is no way I will every return to this place nor would I recommend it to anyone ever. Coincidental a group I am involved with were discussing an Ice Cream Social that very same day when I got back to my office and were considering The Gelato Spot. I was quick to inform them of my experience and none the less we are having the mixer at Yogurt Land!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of great gelato options in a nice venue. I guess they also serve food and pizza."}
{"text":"The coffee flavor wasn't very good, but the red velvet flavor was ok. Overall, not the best gelato I've had."}
{"text":"We traveled from Chandler to Scottsdale for our occasional fix at Gelato Spot, and were pleasantly surprised to find they now have food.

We tried their Classic Pizza and were pleasantly surprised. In places we have visited in Italy, the pizza crust is more important than the toppings, and the Spot has done the crust justice in their wood fired oven. That with simple, fresh toppings makes it even better - ours had a wonderful cheese, olive oil, mushrooms and sausage -  with each flavor being discernible in each bite.

We split the pizza so we had lots of room left for two scoops of gelato. Always consistently good - no ice crystals as we have experienced with gelato places in Chandler. And full flavored - even in Italy some shops can skimp on flavorings to save a few euros.

But alas, no Mediterranean views. But with great gelato and what I think is a pizza done one better, this place will be continue to be on our short list of favorites.

6/12/2012

I had to update my pizza review after 2 more visits. We had one with pepperoni that had a distinctive off taste - and resulted in stomach pangs but no other ill effects. And the last time we repeated the Classic but it was what I would describe as soupy and lacking the balance of flavors that we loved when we first tried it. 

Still, we still do love the way they do gelato and will return for the tiramisu and pistachio flavors."}
{"text":"They probably have the best gelato you can get in the valley, but the food wasn't amazing. The pizza came out a little soggy, with the toppings falling off pretty easily. Besides that, the toppings were tasty (we got the spicy pepperoni) and the service was awesome. They brought out the food fast and the server was very nice. I probably won't eat a meal here again, but I am definitely a fan of their gelato. I always taste a bunch of flavors before I decide what to get, but it's still a hard decision! I love the set up of the place too, they have indoor and outdoor seating with nice lighting. Still have yet to sit upstairs since it's been closed every time i go, but I plan to try it out when it's re-opened."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great with lots of flavors to choose from!! This place was also pretty cool because it was like a lounge. I definitely look forward to visiting this place again :)"}
{"text":"So very, very, very good. I'm staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted pizza for dinner (and also wanted to take a little walk!) so the Gelato Spot it was. When I saw \"gelato and wood fired pizza\" together on my Yelp app, I knew it was going to be a win-win situation.

I have NEVER seen a place with this many gelato flavors. Holy cow! Any flavor you've ever wanted is here, and I was trying to decide which one I wanted to go with, when I laid my eyes on the sign... for gelato shakes. Gelato? Shakes? Gelato in a shake? I had to try it, and went with the small which meant I got to choose two flavors. Yellow cake batter and cookies and cream, it turns out, make quite a nice pair. They put them both in a blender with milk, and voilà! Something tells me I'll be visiting this place later in the week for another genius flavor concoction.

For my pizza, I ordered the marinara, which comes with Di Napoli tomato sauce, fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and Tuscan olive oil. I also added cheese to it. I carried it for about fifteen minutes back to my hotel and I was surprised at how well it held up! The pizza was so good, and the flavors all blended together perfectly. I really enjoyed the thin and chewy crust, and you could tell that the ingredients were high quality.

I hear they have amazing coffee here and I want to try that next time... but if I had to choose one thing from this place, it's the gelato shake. Go try one for yourself and find out!"}
{"text":"I wrote a not so positive review about the Gelato Spot after our office ordered lunch from there. While we were disappointed in our lunch, we do understand that everyone has a bad day, and we will for sure be giving these guys another try, especially since I received a very nice message from their management. How cool was that?! They do have the BEST Gelato in the valley."}
{"text":"This place... hm, mixed feelings.

On quality, availability of seating, street view and curb appeal is place is doing quite well. Areas they could improve however include parking availability, staff friendlies, prices and vibe. I love gelato, almost exclusively over ice cream and I always correct people if they interchange the nouns. This location has a wonderful variety and always tastes great even if it's a flavor I normally don't like... being inside Woodfire is an added bonus.

Although, I am left a little peeved by the staff walking up and down the stairs behind The Gelato Spot counter staring at me. I'll be talking with a scooper/cashier and every time I'm there I feel eyes glaring at me behind her head... If I knew it was a problem with me in particular or a misjudged look I'd resend that complaint, but after the 4th time it's just bizarre. The prices are fairly high, leaving me to buy gelato at the grocery store more often now, which is why I too miss the groupons. They were the only reason I knew it or Woodfire existed. Now onto the parking, the lot would be more effective if sports car(s), owned by I'm assuming the up and/or down owner(s) at the closet and most effective for handicaps spaces, weren't there."}
{"text":"Great concept: wood fired pizza, wide variety of gelato and a bar in a convenient location."}
{"text":"I frequent this place more often than I care to admit but with free samples and a great variety of different gelato flavors how could I not? Some common reasons why you might find me in Gelato Spot:

- Holiday
- Bad Day
- Good Day
- Normal Day
- Sunday... or Monday... or Tuesday-Saturday
- I'm sad
- I'm happy
- It's been several days since my last visit
- It's been several hours since my last visit
- Friends are in town
- I wish my friends were in town

... well you get the picture... one of these days I'll try the pizza place as well and I'm sure it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"YUM! This place is awesome! I stopped by here Friday night with my girlfriends and LOVED IT! The place was clean, the people behind the counter were very helpful, and they had lots of flavors to choose from (I went with mango for my choice). They also have sugar-free options, so I was impressed. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"awful and dirty.  This place has food, and no one wears gloves, they touch everything."}
{"text":"What I love
-Your delicious and bountiful flavors. 
-Comfy chairs that I can sit back on for hours
-Free WiFI = great study spot
- Variety of seating. Indoors or outdoors. Outdoor seating is under a tarp, so the temperature is regulated.
- your shakes! 

Why you bother me
- cravings that can't be satisfied because I live too far from you
- I compare other gelato places to you and end up not as satisfied. The glass doesn't look half as full
- I can't say no to you."}
{"text":"I will be returning here the next time I'm in Old Town Scottsdale!  I was impressed with the variety and texture of the gelato.  Velvety smooth, and dozens of flavors to pick from, some of which I'd never heard of before.  The thing that really made a difference was that my friend who is diabetic had three No Sugar Added flavors to pick from!  Usually there are just one or two at best.  Also, there was Vegan Chocolate, made from coconut milk, and it was delicious.  Sometime I might try the pizza, but only if I can save room for desert!"}
{"text":"Came here to try some gelato! I tried four flavors including pineapple, mint, coconut, & coffee. If I had to choose the flavors, I would definitely aim to get pineapple again. I'd say the coconut comes in a close second!  

Some other perks about the place:
- Free WiFi for a study spot
- Lots of Chairs
- Close by to other places to eat in case you get other food cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is always friendly and the gelato is to die for (well not literally) me and my girlfriend are celebrating here today and the food looks so good."}
{"text":"We couldn't have had a better experience at The Gelato Spot. Found them on Instagram, fell in love with the photos of their pizza and icecream and had to come for a visit. We visited on a weekday around 3pm, kinda slow but we were greeted right away by our server which was helpful and very attentive. She answered any questions we had on the pizzas and we finally opted on the Honey Basil (AMAZING!) and the Veggie. The pizzas were great but my absolute fave was the honey basil, what unique flavors. Of course we had to save room for Gelato, they had so many flavors I went to go check them out myself at the counter and tried a couple and then our server brought them out for us, absolutely delightful. It was a lovely afternoon late lunch on a beautiful day with great food and lovely service. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"My family and I did a trip to Italy years ago (think Griswolds without all the chaos, well just hint of chaos). I had my first taste of and developed quite a crush on gelato while there. My brother and I have this running joke regarding gelato, because whenever we went exploring on our own, he misjudged his directions and we ended up lost (er, farther than where we were supposed to be). I became cranky like a little kid and to \"get me to be quiet\" and make up for us wandering around, he would buy me gelato. Yes, I have a great older brother. Anyway... before my parents and I came into town, he mentioned The Gelato Spot and wanted to take us here. 

Oh man. I was in heaven as soon as I walked in. It's a cute place with really comfy lounge-like chairs. There is plenty of seating outside too, but it was just too hot for me to sit out there. The Gelato Spot offer a variety of flavors and gelato mixture drinks (which I did not try but was tempted). The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in and was patient as I paced up and down trying to decide what I wanted. I tried a sample of the peanut butter. It was good, but not something I really wanted. I could not decide what to pair it with other than chocolate. I'm not very good at pairing stuff, so I stuck with my usual mint chocolate chip and added in a scoop of cookies and cream. Yummy in my tummy, I tell ya. My brother and I enjoyed our desserts, but our mom was not thrilled with the coffee flavored gelato. She said it was good but not as good as she hoped. 

PS: They have free wifi! Gelato and wifi = excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely not my first choice for gelato. Taste generic and more like ice cream rather than gelato. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great location, parking in the back.  Love the vibe. We had a pineapple sorbet which was so light and refreshing.  Also, had another gelato flavor which was creamy and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"This review is for Wood Fired pizza which is connected to the gelato spot. Don't go there, ever. The hipster Chefs have decided that you cannot change any of the toppings on their pizzas. As asinine as that sounds they made it even worse when they decided to charge me for the ice tea that I had yet to drink when we decided not to order a meal. It's clear this a new restaurant but guys, get over yourselves. Your combinations of toppings only appeals to to the most obscure pseudo intellectual hipster trend of the minute crowd. 

If you are looking for a good wood fired pizza with a variety of fresh toppings, go to Grimaldi's. Wood Fired Pizza (the restaurant connected to the Gelato shop) is only for wannabe lumberjacks who need to be told what is good."}
{"text":"I ordered the almond snickers... they don't scoop from the top so don't expect to get very much of the flavor in your gelato ... mine was 99% vanilla with a tiny amount of snickers pieces inside. I asked the gentleman who was helping me what the big deal was and he said he has to scoop from the bottom ... thanks a lot. 
What you see is not what you get! 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went in with a groupon, service was very good, the cashier was very attentive. We ordered the salad and a margarita pizza, the salad was good, but the pizza was a little disappointing, the sauce tasted like the sauce from spaghetti O  's , the basil was over cooked and the crust was still doughy. It was a good deal and I am glad I tried it. Next time, I will stick with they do best is their gelato and coffee."}
{"text":"The espressolatto might be the greatest concoction man has ever dreamed up. Espresso and gelato blended together makes me quiver with delight. My personal favorite is peanut butter and chocolate with an extra shot. I only wish they had a location in Tempe near ASU."}
{"text":"SO-SO gelato in downtown Scottsdale!

I was in the area of Scottsdale's little art-walk village and needed a little snack. The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.

Popular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee
(note: * = what I ordered)

- You can order a small, medium or large. 
- Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup. 
- If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup. 
- If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup. 
- Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor. 

I ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!

I did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried. 

Service was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision. 

Parking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.

Not sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu. I do hope that in the future - they don't make the gelato as sugary as I had during my visit.

{"text":"I go to the Gspot each and every morning for my cup of joe and some conversation with the staff (i find them to be friendly even at such early hours).   Ok, maybe I dont arrive there so early....after all, Im a friggin DJ.

The Gspot has a bit more beyond gelato.  There is yogurt/granolla and fresh fruit each and every morning...along with muffins and assorted pastries.  I typicaly have a breakfast sandwhich made by Rocky himself on a croissant with egg, cheese and bacon.   

I like this gelato spot concept and like even more that it is home spun by a local family here in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter read about their cakes on their website so when I asked her where I should get her birthday cake she told me that Gelato spot had cakes with buttercream frosting(her favorite), 2 flavors of gelato and 3 layers of cake.  She picked out the two flavors online and I filled out the order form and took it to the store along. Well, they didn't have the flavors she picked out, which were listed online - no mention that you should check availability. So I picked out two other flavors & placed the order. My other daughter picked it up 3 days later. Unfortunately we did not realize until we cut the stupid thing that it was NOT buttercream frosting but whipped cream- which my daughter HATES.  This is 2014 and company websites are now your storefront, so make sure the info is accurate and up to date!! When I called to complain, prior to leaving review here, I was told that there wasn't a manager in the store but they would have him call me back. It is now 5 days later and I still haven't heard from back from anyone.  I gave them a chance to resolve this issue and they blew that too.  WON't BE BACK."}
{"text":"I feel a little behind the curve just now finally reviewing one of Old Town's staples in diet cheatery. 

I have [thoroughly] enjoyed the gelato several times, taking advantage of their late hours walking around old town. It has never disappointed, whether I was in a fruity mood (mango and pineapple) or a chocolately indulgent mood (nutella and caramello). 

What I didn't know until recently, and what inspired me to finally yelp this place, is the fact that they serve FOOD! And get this- it's GOOD. They have a big, beautiful wood firing oven and they use it to make fresh, authentic Italian style pizzas and flatbread. I, still feigning a \"diet\", decided to partake in the chopped salad. Loaded with fresh veggies, it's tossed in a tasty dressing and served on a wood fired flat bread. I was in salad heaven. I also tried the pizza, which was delicious and extremely flavorful. You could tell everything was made from scratch- plus, you got to watch it being made. No re-heated cardboard tasting pizza here!

I can't wait to go back and try more of the Pizzas, particularly the BBQ chicken one, which came highly recommended. Obviously, you have to finish your meal with some of their famous gelato. This time, I had salted caramel and chocolate peanut butter. Totally diet friendly, right? Oh well. I'll call it a cheat day."}
{"text":"Pretty average gelato.

I am partial to Arlecchino and any other gelateria that only uses 100% real fruit, homemade chocolate, etc... to flavor their gelato.  Gelato Spot doesn't.  As a result there is a very distinct difference in quality and flavor.

If you live in Old Town and are feeling lazy, go to Gelato Spot.  If you live anywhere else and/or are not feeling lazy, drive a few more miles to Arlecchino for 5-star gelato."}
{"text":"I ~heart~ Gelato Spot!  Yum yum, it only took me 3 samples to make my choice.  The hazelnut was nutty goodness, the pistachio was delis, but I went with the passion fruit.  Great location, I love the heated patio.  I didn't even mind the smell of exhaust fumes from traffic, the gelato was that good!"}
{"text":"We have the wood fired pizza and we each got our Frozen frappe everything was absolutely delicious the pizza is just amazing and the frappe rivals Dutch Bros!! We didn't have the gelato but man it looks amazing too!"}
{"text":"The almond snickers gelato is the most popular. My favorite is the roasted almond with the pistachio gelato. It's a great combination! Get a medium or large cup so you can get more than one scoop and combine flavors! Such as NY Cheesecake and strawberry for a strawberry shortcake flavor!"}
{"text":"Who knew the Gelato Spot had a full menue of pizzas, salads, paninis? And it's good food too! I tried the proscuitto, tomato, mozzarella panini. It was enough to split into two meals. The bread was very tasty and their ingredients were fresh...  I'm looking forward to trying their pizza too!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Honestly they mixed up our simple orders a couple times, but they acknowledged their mistakes and gave us double the food for half the price! Nice!"}
{"text":"I never thought a gelato place would have good pizza. But The Gelato Spot totally have that!! We had marinara with extra cheese. The crust is thinner than i thought but it is crispy. It taste wonderful when it's hot. The focaccia chop salad is good, too. The focaccia itself is crispy and fluffy with a hint of flavor. The chop salad is fresh and each piece is cover with the dressing with the just right of amount. The salad is not soggy at all so the focaccia still taste good event they put the salad above it. The gelato is a little bit pricey. But it is good though. I can taste the real pineapple in it."}
{"text":"we hit up the G spot for some dessert. we ordered an individual red velvet mousse cake and small cup of vanilla bean gelato to share. it was the perfect after dinner treat! i would definitely return to try some other yummy gelato."}
{"text":"Been here for the Gelato before and it is good BUT the pizzas are terrible.  The \"crust\" tastes like a hard, store bought lavosh.  The pizza was supposed to have carmelized pear, prosciutto di parma, pistachios, wood fired onions, arugula, goat cheese.  The waitress tells us they no longer use prosciutto, OK, so they asked if regular ham is acceptable.  I said it was.  This pizza had ABSOLUTELY no flavor.  Had to look all over to find a couple of small pieces of pear.  Everything except arugula needed a magnifying glass to find.  If you are in Scottsdale and want pizza, skip this place and head over to Crust!"}
{"text":"I am sad to admit that in my 32 years on this earth, I had never had Gelato until tonight.  It was one of the greatest things I have ever put in my mouth!

The wife and I ate dinner at Grimaldis and had to walk off some pizza so we headed up Scottsdale Blvd and saw this on our left.  I had to stop.  

I got 2 flavors....chocolate and almond snickers.  The almond snickers was awesome with just enough nuts and caramel twist etc.  Now the plain chocolate gelato....this my friends was freaking AMAZING!  It was so light and creamy.  The taste reminded me of eating a chocolate cake...the best chocolate cake ever....and this was in gelato form.  It was a little over 5 bucks for 2 scoops.  I like how they give you a dinky little \"shovel\" to eat your gelato.  Makes your brain think you are eating way more because its in such small doses on the tiny spoon.  

I didnt know what I was missing out on all these years never having  tried gelato.  I plan on going back here at least twice more over the next 3 days I have left in AZ.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"I was recently in Scottsdale for a conference and on the way out we stopped by this place. The name is misleading, they do have gelato, but they have so much more. Their pizza is fantastic. I had the buffalo pizza which is margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella. I also tried the proscuitto crudo pizza which was perfect. This place is a win. Oh yea their gelato ROCKS!! I am a fan of pizza, gelato and really everything in the italian cuisine. I'm already looking forward to another trip just to eat."}
{"text":"In keeping with the Italian theme today, I decided gelato would make nice sweet treat after my delightful experience at Best of Italy (see how I interweave these things together...but wait, there's more!).
In a rare \"daily double\" I am able to interweave National Pizza Party Day (come on...pizza is mostly Italian) with National Strawberry Month...That's right...strawberry Gelato!!!!
There has been much less attitude and better  service by the staff on my recent visits to the G-Spot, and for that they get my thanks and my gelato dollars.
It's funny, ever since Gabi posted the thread about strawberries...I've had a bit of a craving.
G-Spot...you scratched my itch very nicely today:)"}
{"text":"Almost as good as Italy! Definitely good for Scottsdale and it's all about the butter pecan!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the gelato was creamy delicious! So glad we stopped in after our dinner at crab and mermaid nearby. They were out of pistachio, but the birthday cake and vanilla were great!"}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza.. Not overdone with sauce or cheese.. Just right.. Will came back again."}
{"text":"Yummmers... the gelatos were looking perfect in their display and presentation was on point. So many flavors to choose from, many friendly staff to help you. 

I'm more of a fruity person so I always opt for a fruity option. When I was in Italy I went on a gelato eating spree- breakfast, lunch and dinner. And this place reminded me of why I wanted gelato because it's oh so delicious. I went for the some kind of berry mix (as usual) and it was delicious! My friend got the thin mints gelato and that was OMG good! It was a perfect balance between the actual thin mints and the vanilla. One thing was I felt the portions were smaller for the price. I believe it was like $4 ish and the scoop of gelato was stingier than others I've been too. It was deceiving because it looks round and full at the top but there's nothing down in the bottom ... boohoo. 

Oh another thing I liked about this place was you can sit on the patio and people watch, they have misters so you won't get hot. Also one of the few gelato places that is actually well ventilated."}
{"text":"I love gelato and this place is always great with lots of flavors to choose from. Perfect for a quick meeting, first date, or gelato to go!"}
{"text":"Today my gelato was not spot on - my cone was broken from top to bottom - good thing the wrapper held it together. The scoop was super tiny and I had to ask for the chocolate twirl cookie. The person with me got 1 scoop (1/2 chocolate and 1/2 peanut butter) in a cup it was 2 full scoops. Not a consistent day today at all. Usually I would rate all 5s but today not so much."}
{"text":"The gelato at Gelato Spot might be the best this side of the Rio Grande!  So many flavors and so little cardio that I do at the gym... ugh.  The gourmet pizzas are very good too.  I am a fan of traditional (sausage and mushroom with red sauce)... but I have had some of the others too and they are all very good.  My only knock would be that sometimes they don't spread out the sauce and toppings as much as I'd like so there is a lot of crust... and let's face it -- pizza is all about the sauce and cheese and toppings!"}
{"text":"Great gelato flavors and interior. Bad side of my experience was trying to find it... And the girl who was behind the counter. We weren't greeted and she seemed bothered by us sampling. The menu board was also non-existent. So, it was a surprise to figure out the total. It wasn't too expensive for the quality. I would recommend the almond snickers and the coffee gelato."}
{"text":"The hubs and I ate tons of great gelato in Italy and nothing really compares. So we were shocked to find authentic tasting gelato while on a business trip in Scottsdale.  The flavors are awesome. The creaminess and temperature are spot-on. Recommend trying the banana, peanut butter, and caramel."}
{"text":"Happened to yelped this and gave it a try. The taste test scoop tasted pretty good but the actual smallest size cup taste just went down hill after the second and third spoon scoops. It was too sweet and it did not taste creamy despite of it being made with coconut milk. Must have been coconut milk out of a can. Even ice cream made with cashews would taste better."}
{"text":"I really liked the place as far as atmosphere and service and would go again to try other flavors I just wasn't impressed with the gelato that I had. I tried salty caramel, pistachio and one other but don't remember what. All were good (I don't think I've ever had gelato I wouldn't say was at least good as I love the stuff) but I've definitely had better. If you've never had gelato I would give them a shot and if you're like me and have had gelato many places I still think its a place worth trying."}
{"text":"IN A NUTSHELL: Gelato, coffee, food, brick oven pizzas, and was that booze? all rolled into one place!

LOCATION/PARKING: Towards the north end of Old Scottsdale. Easy, but small parking lot in the rear. Wheel chair accessible.

VIBE: Clean, modern, cozy, friendly, trendy without being annoying

GELATO: Pretty great selection!! I loved the Salted Caramel and the New York Cheesecake. 

FOOD: Didn't look at the menu, but the food coming out for other customers looked very tasty! Wish I could have tried a pizza. There's also a coffee bar. And booze?! (I think?)

VALUE: Expected prices for gelato and Scottsdale eats. Nothing crazy expensive.

FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommend this place! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of gelato. Great service. Nice seating. The best gelato ever. Tiramisu gelato is to die for. Try it yourself!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a lovely lunch and awesome selection of perfect and light gelato. Very nice ambiance with pizza oven and nice comfy seating.. I had the Focaccia Chicken Caesar, my husband had his favorite sandwich, we really enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"In this 100+ degree weather, I got the Salted Caramel gelato and it hit the spot! The texture was smoothy and the pirouline was also tasty."}
{"text":"I love that they have a ton of dairy free sorbets and also a few vegan gelatos! Last night I tried the vegan chocolate which was sooo rich and delicious. I ended up getting the vegan coconut which was excellent! Light, creamy, refreshing and it had bits of actual coconut in it.  I was so amazed at how they made it so creamy without using milk. I also got a scoop of the raspberry sorbet, but it wasn't a very good combo with the coconut bc it tasted too sour and tangy in comparison. 

I also like that it's connected to a pizza place. A perfect one stop shop for a night out. There was plenty of comfortable seating in the dining area and it was quiet enough to easily hold a conversation. Also there was lots of interesting people watching for all the people going in and out of the bar upstairs. I'll definitely be back for more vegan gelatos the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"An evening out in Old Town is rarely complete without a post-dinner stroll to The Gelato Spot, and I can find absolutely no reason to subtract stars. The location is perfectly central, so it doesn't matter where you had dinner - this is always \"on the way\" home and always worth every bite. 

Their gelato flavors are mostly standard, although the seasonal flavors and chef-inspired creations have been really impressive. Of course you'd expect a pumpkin gelato around the holidays, but it was so delicious I had a hard time keeping it to one scoop! I have yet to meet a flavor I dislike, but I don't anticipate that happening.  After all, you can sample as many choices as your sweeth tooth desires before committing to just one delicious flavor or combine for the perfect heavanly dessert (if you have room, which I never do). Even their coffee is exceptional and totally hits the spot on cooler winter nights.

The vibe is energetic and laid back at the same time: everyone is just coming here for that near coma-inducing sugary, creamy indulgence and in no rush to end a perfectly enjoyable night. It's incredible that as busy as it gets the staff can maintain so much patience and be so friendly while doling out countless samples. While I haven't tried anything from their lunch/dinner menu, their dessert/coffee/wine are plenty to keep this girl as a regular."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato and nice thin crust pizza!! Pig and pineapple the best!! Service was very friendly too. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't order pizza here! It's gross and watery. The gelato, on the other hand, looks amazing. But I was way over this place by the time I finished the pizza that I didn't even want to try their Gelato... that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Ok.  So I read all the reviews on Yelp before usually making a final decision to visit a place.  The Gelato Spot, however, just so happens to be right by my work location, so it has become a convenient stop and a staple to my lunch locations.  The surprising thing about this place....
Not only is their gelato my favorite of all places around Phoenix/Scottsdale (try their seasonals - my fav was Canteloupe) they now serve phenomenal light lunch food.

First time we did lunch, I tried the margherita pizza, and the italian panini (ask for it warm).  mmm mmm....  mozzarella, proscuitto, home-grown basil... everything is so fresh!   I've now been back to try out their salads, paninis and other pizzas.  

This location is more touristy, but its worth a visit for a nice lunch and a yummy treat!"}
{"text":"One word: scrumptious.

Two words: affogato style.

Three words:  gelato with espresso.

Four words: need i say more?"}
{"text":"The workers here are so sweet.  I am one of the bad customers that end up sampling over 10 different gelatos.  They were wonderful because none of the workers complained!  In other words, great customer service!  As for the gelato, it's extremely tasty and it comes with a little wafer or cookie straw that adds that special addition to your gelato.  My favorite flavors are the pistachio, almond, strawberry, cheesecake, and salty caramel.  I always end up getting two flavors.  Make sure if you do this, get two flavors that compliment each other (don't get two that are very sweet or you will regret like me).   

This place is great for a date with a friend or lover.  It's big and some areas have a cushion area where you can sit close."}
{"text":"The gelato here is so delicious!!  Perfect for a late night snack. They have a large variety of flavors and let you taste test them!!!  Definitely get at least 2 scoops!  It's worth it.
There's seating inside but space is limited. There's also a pizza place inside and the seating is shared. I've never had a problem and have gone multiple times."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for pizza! They use super high quality ingredients, so it tastes as good as some of the higher end/high priced/well known options around town, but they're very reasonably priced & almost never a wait time for a table. I've had almost every pizza on the menu and they're always perfect.

Of course the gelato is the best I've ever had. Fresh flavors straight from Italy and I had my first ever Affagato here, which is 2 shots of espresso poured over a scoop of gelato. Amazing!

The service is great and the staff provides a nice back home atmosphere where everybody is friendly towards each other. Five stars for food, service & price!"}
{"text":"This review is only with respect to their gelato! We haven't yet ventured beyond gelato but will make it our next stop when we're in the mood for pizza.

The gelato LOOKS delicious from the get-go, and they have so many flavors to choose from!  We haven't been disappointed in any flavors that we've tried:  tiramisu, pumpkin pie, almond snickers, cookies & cream."}
{"text":"I live near the 32nd Street location, but they don't sell coffee, so I decided to go to the one in old town Scottsdale. I am glad I did, because they have some of the best ice coffee I have ever had. The interior is very nice and clean too."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I never tried this place for lunch before.  The panini I had was great! It didn't break the bank and it was so large I took half of it to go.  Two people could easily split one and add on a side salad and have a super cheap and delicious lunch. I really like their unsweetened herbal iced tea, too. l Iook forward to giving the pizza a try next time."}
{"text":"Okay, let me preface with saying 'I am a recent transplant from the Chicagoland area'. Therefore, I am picky because I've HAD the best so I know what I'm talking about.

My workmates love the gelato here but I do not. The reason: It tastes too much like premium ice cream. Too rich. Gelato is SUPPOSED to be made with a lesser fat milk and although it is denser than ice cream, that only should mean that the flavor is stronger. I am a gelato lover, but I do not enjoy the gelato here. It's not bad, but it's just not what I'm used to.

I've also had the food here (yes, there's food!). They make AWESOME paninis!

So for me... it's a 50/50. Don't hate it. Don't love it."}
{"text":"\"Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, it was only one woman for her.
Joey: What are you talking about? One woman? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\"

I find myself with a similar conflict at the G spot. And Ross hadn't even begun to explore the world of gelato yet. 

Wood fired pizza AND gelato in the same place should be illegal. There is just way too much happiness occurring all in one experience. And did I mention they are about to have cocktails as well? You know how after you experience your first orgasm, you want to just hide in your room and experience it again and again? Well, that's how I feel about the G Spot. They named it that for a reason, after all."}
{"text":"I remember as kid my older sister would drive me to one of the only gelato places in town in old town Scottsdale. I don't think this was it, but I know it's near the same area. Old Town has changed so much over the years. I remember when they tore down the Kachina theater (where I saw E.T.) to put up the forever abandoned Galleria. I remember when they tore down my favorite hot dog joint and put up a Gilbert Ortega behind the cowboy sign.

Anyway - even though this probably isn't the same gelato place I vaguely remember as a kid and it's totally modern inside, it still makes me feel nostalgic. It's a great place to stop by if you're walking around downtown and want a cold treat. It's an even better place to get dinner. This location serves wood-fired pizza, salads, and sandwiches as well.

I have been here a bunch of times, but recently had some lunch. I ordered a Pepperoni and Sausage pizza. It was insane. It comes on a hand-tossed thin crust which is flavorful and just the right amount of crispy. The pepperonis were spicy and some of the best I've ever had. I was truly impressed. Price-wise, it was a lot of food for the money and you could tell it was high quality ingredients. The portions are perfect for leaving room for a bit of gelato, feeling full but not bloated and about to die, and also friendly on the wallet.

I also had some of my girlfriend's salad and was impressed with that as well. We finished it off with some gelato of course - 2 flavors each so we got to try 4 (plus the free tastes). I try not to eat ice cream or gelato very often, but this is definitely worth the calories. 

Service is great - everyone that works there is nice and friendly. The place is always clean and apparently they are soon going to be opening the upstairs as a dining area. The decor is modern and feels very upscale. This would be a fantastic place to take a first date if you're in high school or college and on a budget. You'll get out of here for less than you would at a chain like Outback or something."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Gelato is a little heavy for me but the flavors were all delicious, it was hard to chose. 

They have this charity event that I am not quite sure how it works but they have 3 really great flavors that are in competition but they won't let you mix them. Meaning if you want 2 scoops, one of the scoops can't be one of those 3 flavors. You can get 2 scoops of he same flavor but who wants to do that? I found that odd and annoying but hey it's for charity, I think. 

They offer pizza and salads and have a separate coffee bar. Yep...

I am for sure going back for next months elvis flavor though."}
{"text":"There are so many choices, it makes it hard to decide what to get.  The employees take their time with each customer, in case you want to try EVERY SINGLE FRIGGIN FLAVOR like the customer in front of me.  And, they do it with a smile.  I wouldn't have been as patient as The Gelato Spot employees.  I guess that's why they're there and I am on the other side of the counter.  

But if the only downside I see to The Gelato Spot is that their customer service is superior, I suppose there is nothing to complain about.

Of course, they could use more parking... especially since whenever I am in the mood they seem to be PACKED.

But the gelato is seriously delicious and even worth the $ you shell out for it.  

I have not tried anything other than the gelato, but after reading the reviews here... I will be sure to try the pizza or a panini next time!"}
