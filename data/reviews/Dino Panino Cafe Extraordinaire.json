{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in Woodbridge.    I have been coming to this restaurant for lunch 2-4 times per week for over a year now and never get tired of the food they serve.  There are a variety of dishes and you can order something new every day for a month (at least).  Everything is made to order (except the soup) which is made in the morning.  Pasta and spaghetti are hand made topped with a variety of sauces designed by the head chef, with a menu in which everyone can find their own favorite dish.  The salads are also great topped with chicken or tuna with simple Italian dressings on the side.  The sandwiches are also good.  Fresh meats, vegetables and bread.  All in all, this establishment specializes in serving delicious, fresh, clean and more importantly healthy alternative to going out for lunch in the heart of Woodbridge.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but for the same size breaded-veal sandwhich I'll go to Nino D'aversa on woodbridge ave!! it's about a $4-$5 difference!"}
{"text":"I am a strong believer of the saying you get what you pay for.  The sandwiches here are a little pricey but I have to say one of the best veal sandwiches I have ever had.  I'd rather pay more and know that I will be satisfied.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Had the Dino signature and it was pretty tasty.   My cuz loved the veggie panino.  Depending on hours I may be back to try out something else.   Definitely worth a try if you are a panini lover."}
{"text":"The interior is clean and modern.  Great food served in minutes.  They serve pasta, sandwiches and salads.   Admittedly I've only tried the sandwiches which are delicious.  I also recommend a side of dried italian sausage.  The place also has a full espresso bar."}
{"text":"Food was alright. A tad more starch than I would have liked and a bit more expensive, but I think that was because of the special I ordered. I guess I was expecting better quality based on the location. The place itself feels very nice and inviting, the staff is very friendly. The food unfortunately is rather forgettable, not bad, just not great."}
