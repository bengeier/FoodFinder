{"text":"Fatty sandwiches are very filling and pretty awesome panini styles that have never been less than great 20-40x. Pizza is always very tasty. Nice Cobb salad too. Spaghetti is very nice and they even sell gallon cans of their own sauce for you to make your own at home! Sunday special pizza-chicken-jojos n slaw with rolls combo never disappoints! Takeout is always consistent and service is always very nice and pleasant - staff has never been bad at the table or the takeout counter! The hamburger rocked! Reliable, much better than average if not great food."}
{"text":"I order a pizza and chicken wings.  The pizza was undercooked.  The crust was literally raw dough.  The wings were the wrong flavor.  When I called I was told someone would contact me the following Monday.   I never received a  call.   When I called back a week and a half later they refused to remake the order.   I was sick for two days after eating their pizza! When I called later they told me there was nothing they could do, they couldn't even remake the order!   I spent $46 dollars to be sick for two days.  Never ordering from here again.   Poor quality, worse service."}
{"text":"We ordered Chicken Marsala without mushrooms.  What was served was a chicken breast covered in brown gravy.  We also had the \"homemade lasagna\".  It had layers of gray pureed meat with ricatta cheese.  The noodles were tough and rubbery.  We also had beef ravioli which also had this pureed gray meat inside, served with the toughest unseasoned meatballs I have ever had.  The sauce was meh.  I looked around the restaurant and noticed that most everyone had pizzas or sandwiches.  I can understand why.  If you go there stick with that.  I am Italian and it was an insult to try to eat those entrees (which we did not)."}
