{"text":"I am from US, and it's my first time to visit this place and since I worked in Middle East for so many years, I am craving for something authentic Mediterranean and I find this place the best among the best... the food, the service especially Yasmina, the service she provides, and the authenticity of the restaurant... they even incorporate the hookah to feel the ambiance.  It's like you are in the Middle East.
Highly recommended.

{"text":"Nice little pub with 2 awesome patios. Dog friendly on the patio which is great for us dog owners that want to enjoy a pint with the pooch.  Haven't eaten here, but eager to try the Mediterranean cuisine.  My only complaint...the music. Very middle eastern - not my jam!"}
