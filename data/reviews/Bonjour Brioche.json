{"text":"I met family here for brunch on the weekend.  I had the baked french toast - it was delicious!  The place is very quaint - definitely feels like you are in Paris!  I would describe this place as a definite A-OK.  I wouldn't give it any higher due to my personal tastes. My issues are that it's cash only, very busy and very loud."}
{"text":"I love Bonjour Brioche! It is one of the best casual, unpretentious places to get brunch and have some amazing baked goods in the city.  From their baguettes to tarts or frangiapane, this is pure French pâtisserie indulgence. On the savoury end, their sandwiches and croque madame consistently cease to disappoint me.   If you're in the area and the line is not too bad definitely stop in."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but sadly I can't.  I dined in once & ordered take out three times.  I can say with certainty that service is consistent.  It's horrid.  I expected to wait as this place is always busy.  I just didn't expect the attitude - at least treat your customers like you want them to be here.  When I ordered take out, I'm ignored me in favour of people behind me. I was a little taken aback the first time and thought maybe I wasn't standing in the proper place.  The second and third time?  When I dined in I was expecting to have a nice, relaxed lunch with a friend.  My soup was barely warm when served.  I was willing to let it pass but thought I should mention it to the waitstaff so they would know.  She acted offended and stayed that way for the rest of our meal.   It's a shame really as I enjoyed (most of) the food but hate the service."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review - 3/5 for brunch and 5/5 for dessert.  Two of us went here on a Sunday at around 12:30 pm. We waited about 35 minutes for a table. FYI - they take CASH ONLY.  Food: 3/5 - Croissant - was very buttery which was great, but a bit too dense in my opinion - Bonjour Brioche Eggs Benny with Salmon on a croissant - it also came with a mixed green salad and part of a baguette with a large chunk of butter. The plate was half covered in salad and I could have done with half the salad. The eggs benedict was underwhelming. It lacked flavour and richness - the eggs were runny rather than having that golden yolk and I didn't really taste the hollandaise sauce. My favourite part of the plate was the baguette and butter - the baguette was almost perfect: doughy in the centre with a golden crust.  - Croque Madame - I didn't get to try it but was told it was underwhelming as well  DESSERT: 5/5 - Lemon tart - the lemon custard was tart (maybe too tart for some) but this is meant for a true lemon dessert lover - Pear almond tart - So delicious! The almond cake/crust is perfect: moist inside and crisp on the outside. The pears add balance to the rich crust and it's dusted with icing powder to finish. I highly recommend this dessert!  Although the food was a bit of a disappointment, I will definitely be back for the desserts, baguettes, and will have to try their brioche royal (with lemon raspberry or blueberry custard) which was sold out when we got there. I wouldn't recommend lining up to eat here, but would highly recommend having a coffee and dessert or taking a dessert/bread to go."}
{"text":"Cute Cute Cute! This place is adorable.! Arrive early, there tends to be a line...but it's worth it.  Better than typical breakfast fare.  The pastries were  fresh and the meals were creative. The neighbourhood is still up and coming, but there are some cute shops around if you're having a slow Sunday in the city!"}
{"text":"I was there about 10 days ago and it is only now I can even talk about it.  My husband and I went to Bonjour Brioche for the second time.  It was a Tuesday morning.  The other customers glared at us as if we didn't have a right to be there because we weren't regulars.  That is immediately off-putting, though not the fault of the restaurant, itself.  We ordered... My husband got the French Toast and I ordered the Poached eggs on potatoes with smoked salmon, a small helping of caviar perched on top and some sour cream.  It sounds wonderful, but the menu description failed to include the long black hair that was cooked right into the middle of all of this!   The waitress apologized, but I had to get out of my seat, ask who the manager was, and tell her I wasn't going to pay for my meal.  She looked down her nose at me and finally agreed.  She later apologized to my husband, not me... he was not the offended party - I was!  This place is over-priced and no better quality control than your local greasy spoon as was my experience.  I will never go back under any circumstances."}
{"text":"There are many things to like about this place: the ambience, amazing staff, quaint decor and most of all, the quality of the food.  We went over on Saturday morning, fortunately there was no lineup when we got there. We got served fresh coffee soon after sitting down. We sipped away as we looked over the specials. I went with the eggs benny with salmon served on a crossiant. Got a taste of their french baguette as a side on this dish. it was heavenly. There was a healthy portion of salad on the side. I got a taste of the french toast, which was so moist and flavourful. Probably one of the best french toast I have ever had. Would have liked to have tried the quiche...oh well next time...  What a beautiful way to start the weekend!"}
{"text":"Seems like everybody know each other. Very much like old neighbourhood restaurant. Great services and good food. I loved it"}
{"text":"Came for an 8 am Friday morning treat and all the brioches are gone?!?! I was told someone came in and bought 30 of each! I had to settle for croissants and I couldn't have been happier. The best croissants I've ever had a pleasure in trying. I wish I could have stayed for breakfast as all the dishes that came out looked simply amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"i really love their croque monsieur which was accompanied by an amazing salad and this is coming from a guy who doesnt eats his veggies - thumbs up!! my friend had the scrambled eggs with fish roe and it does look very appetizing! cappuccino was well done. alas, the service was really slow perhaps due to the long weekend and the peameal bacon was really delicious albeit a tiny bit overcooked and left out in the cold for a bit. if it was piping hot, it would be a perfect meal, its still delicious and i'm definitely going back to try the other brunch items on the menu. as a fan of weekend brunch and everything breakfast, i heartily recommend this place :D"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. The food was wonderful - a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, interesting mains and eggs. I had a delicious hot chocolate and a croque madame. Everything was fresh and tasted great.   The only downside to the restaurant is that it's packed and servers can be a little scattered. I stood waiting for a table for ten minutes while I counted six staff who walked past me, made eye contact and then just ignored me without seating me. Then they tried to seat another table who walked in the other door before I had to intervene.   I really enjoyed the brunch. Just up the service and I'll be clamouring to come back."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of Bonjour brioche, especially in the summer months, with perfect lilting jazz. Brunching alfresco or inside, the place has the perfect cozy feel to it which instantly relaxes you, and puts you in a \"i-have-all-the-time-in-the-world\" conversation mode with your fellow brunchers.  I really like the hot chocolate(which i've ordered every single time i've been here), the quiche & french toast. The salad can be a bit soggy from dressing overload at times, but its easily fixed by just ordering dressing on the side.   Overall one of my favourite brunch spots, more so for the laid back cozy ambiance than just for the food itself."}
{"text":"yum yum yum. Not an elaborate nor extensive menu but they do have, they do it right. Had a wonderful time with my nephew."}
{"text":"English people are pretty famous for ripping off other cultures and then slowly chip away the authenticity and character of said-culture.The result of this process is usually places like Bonjour Brioche.  You shouldn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes for a Croque Monsieur, and a bistro is supposed to be an intimate setting for a quick bite to eat and conversation, but because everyone feels the need to be a trendy douche this place is jam packed and overpriced.   My solution, instead of publicly submitting yourselves to this bastardized French tradition, buy a bistro table set at Home Depot, Google an authentic croque monsieur recipie and put it all together in the privacy of your over-priced basement apartment. Or if you own a home, charge it all to your nearly maxed out credit card and enjoy those previous moments where you can escape reality.   This is a stupid place - don't bother."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best cafés I have visited in Toronto. Wonderful service and absolutely delicious food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"got croissants to go. best in toronto that i had.  went there twice in two days. nuff said."}
{"text":"I  this place. It smells amazing firstly. We waited an hour in line in the freezing cold and it was worth it. The smell kept us going. Its what I imagine Paris smells like...coffee and baked bread.   I had a Benny...very very good. They made a classic perfectly. My husband had the bacon sandwich on a baguette...surprisingly good. Simple but well executed.   But their fruit tarts take the cake. They were amazing. I wanna take them to every party i go to. Nothing but good things to say about brunch here. (Get the latte bowl, hehe so cool)"}
{"text":"Cozy, cute interior with a nice looking selection of baked goods.  The service was awful despite being very friendly.  Server got 2 of our 3 entrees wrong.  Coffee tasted weak and burnt.  Brioche were dry.  I will say that the other dishes I saw at other tables looked good.  It took 4 attempts at ordering before they weren't \"out of that too.\"  I might go back and see if this was just an off day."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch.  Fresh selection of baked goods. Amazing croissants that sell out quickly. Baguettes with their whipped butter are delicious.  Great for pairs. Not good for large groups."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and consistently great. Their baked goods are among the best I have had in the city, their french baguette is the way a french baguette should be. Can't wait to be in the area again to go for brunch."}
{"text":"4 things that made this a 4 star review from a no star review:  I wasnt going to review Bonjour Brioche, because well lets admit it, it has 26 three or more star reviews already and what could I possibly say to enrich this experience any more that other yelpers havent?  1) They ONLY take cash. No plastic. There is a $1.99 ATM downstairs near the bathrooms though. 2) The pastries, service and ambiance give this brunch that something special. 3) If the specials are listed on the board, dont even bother looking at the menu. The specials are made fresh with care and consistency.  4) Since the summer months are here, so are their Pomegranate Mimomas. You cant have just one!  Why not a 5 star review? 1) They charge $3 extra if youre opting for egg whites only. HMPH!!  2) The coffee pretty much sucks. 3) Water glasses smell like eggs. *barf*"}
{"text":"While I can't stand to wait in line for brunch, they do have an excellent peameal bacon sandwich if you're inclined to sit-down and eat. But as tasty as it is, I wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes in line for it.  You can, however, skip the line and pick up one of their awesome croissants to munch as you go. Their croissants are good - light and flaky as they should be. And grab a baguette for later! The baguette has a nice chew to it and is best with a simple smear of butter. Both are worth getting."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere  - all amazing!!!    Long wait (but totally worth it). Cash only. Come prepared."}
{"text":"I grew up in France so I understand the value of a good croissant. That being said the lineups here are absolutely mind-boggling on the weekend. Best to just head through the front door and grab some baked goods from the counter. Food is nice, but nowhere near worth the fuss."}
{"text":"Delicious omelette, coffee and croissants. Just what you'd expect from a French cafe."}
{"text":"we got a ticket - be careful where you park on the street!    Bakery smells and looks good, everything else was ok."}
{"text":"Food doesn't nearly compare to Lady Marmalade or even some of the chain brunch spots like Fran's.  I ordered the Croque Madame - it was tasteless for the most part, and the peameal bacon didn't taste like much. Just a very regular sandwich in my mind. My bf ordered the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs, which was pretty tasteless as well. The piece of smoked salmon was about the size of a single piece of salmon sashimi just so you're warned before ordering this. I wanted to like this place so i ordered a dessert to give it one last shot to impress me. Their creme brulee tart was cold and too sweet and the layer of sugar was not nicely burnt.   the place has a good relaxing vibe to it, but all in all a disappointment and not worth the wait nor the hype. you're better off going to a chain like Fran's or Cora's."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for brunch. I arrived close to 1 to find a small line outside. Luckily most tables were finishing up so my friend and I were able to get seated within 10 minutes. The place is a kinda small and since it was extremely hot that day, it was extremely stuffy inside the restaurant. So, we opted to sit on the side patio instead.  We ordered the Baked French Toast - with fresh fruit & maple syrup ($8.50). It consisted of two thick slices of cinnamon bread topped with powdered sugar. It was pretty dense in the middle and had a consistency of bread pudding. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, so I didn't enjoy the french toast too much (the middle anyways). Despite this, I actually really enjoyed the outsides of the french toast (the parts which weren't heavy/creamy).   We also ordered the Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs - with chives, rosti potato, creamed horseradish and caviar ($10). The eggs were cooked perfectly (I can't stand overcooked rubbery scrambled eggs!) and the combination of the horseradish and fish roe was nice. The rosti potato didn't have a whole lot of flavour on its own, but tasted pretty good with the eggs.  Although we were both stuffed, we couldn't resist ordering a dessert after seeing the dessert tray the server brought around to show the customers. Since the server recommended the raspberry tart ($5), we went with that. The tart was filled with custard and raspberry. Overall, a decent tart.  Overall everything was good but I don't know if anything was good enough to warrant another visit (for brunch, anyways), since I don't live in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been working on saulter st for a year, brioche has been my everyday morning coffe for a fair good price, always pack nd smell good, sandwich cheap and good come down for coffee n croisant now for $2.75"}
{"text":"A nice place for brunch! I ordered a quiche Lorraine and an egg benedict, both delicious! The side salad is the best I've ever tried, but remember to make sure the sauce is evenly mixed~ The side french loaf is a little dry, but it's nice with soup. Other bakeries like croissants and tarts are adorable as well. The only sligtly annoying thing is CASH ONLY~"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere for brunch or lunch! Great coffee and French food. You will have to wait in line if you go on Sunday for brunch. My family waited about 30 minutes for a table at about 11:30, which is pretty decent. It is probably better to go with only two people, as the table was a bit crowded with 3. I had a delicious French toast, and my family seemed to enjoy their quiches.   I took off a star because of their chocolate croissants. We got some to go, and when we ate them later we discovered that they only had a tiny little strip of chocolate inside? Definitely not enough chocolate to classify them as \"chocolate croissants\"."}
{"text":"Have the baked french toast! If you like french toast and you also like pastries it's a no brainer. The baked french toast is basically crumpled pastries made into french toast - it's an awesome breakfast, although heavy on the calories I'm sure.  The restaurant itself looks a bit dated but the food was great and service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"This place is still consistent and one of the best brunch spots in the queen east area. I haven't been here in years, but went again 2 weeks ago, and was very pleased with the food.  I had the bonjour breakfast, at first I thought it wouldn't be filling enough. But it was, and boy was it good. We had a party of 4 and everyone was delighted with their choices."}
{"text":"Of all the places that have a lineup in Leslieville, this one actually deserves it. The bread is fantastic and I love the quiches. Their spicy bacon sandwich is excellent. I think strangely enough, my favorite part of the meal is the salad. Fresh greens with an excellent dressing."}
{"text":"Your pastries aren't good enough to put up with the terrible service. Just visited this establishment today (Sunday afternoon). Tables full, with one party waiting at the back of the restaurant. Server one tells us it'll be a few minutes wait and politely asks us to wait behind the other party.  Not two minutes later does an entitled, snotty young male server inform us that he is going to be needing that space to move back and forth, and that we need to \"give him space\". We asked where a more appropriate place to stand might be, and he gave us no option. Told us they needed all the space. He proceeds to fly by us, the other party AND the seated guests at the closest table, flinging the door open and letting to bash close every time he goes in and out - spilling the drinks on his tray at the same time.   Rude, inconsiderate and disrespectful to patrons frequenting the establishment.  If you aren't good with people, get another job. You are in the service industry. Sunday brunch isn't the time for a power trip.  Took us 5 minutes to realize that the good - not great - pastries and limited menu were not worth putting up with our new friend any longer.  Gingerly mentioned the unprofessional behaviour to the owner as we were leaving, who is either clueless or careless as she offered no apology or concern about her employees behaviour.   Brave the line one block down at Lady Marmalade for a FAR superior experience across the board. Food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot - but get there early (like, at 8am) before the line-up gets too long. The small space fills up not only with people, but with hunger-inducing aromas of baked goods - I think I gained 3 pounds just from these sweet scents alone! Coffee is bottomless and I was never without a full steaming mug, thanks to the attentive staff. I had the Croque Madam - ham and gruyere on brioche topped with a fried egg. It was balanced well by the light side salad. Though I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the baguette on the side, but it tasted so much like my grandmother's baked bread from the village, in the end, I wanted more. Got chocolate croissants to go for a mid-morning snack later on. I love this place and would go back in an instant."}
{"text":"Delicious savoury brunch choices. Everything in this place smells and tastes like butter, in a rich and wonderful way. I love the croque madam, but I'm a sucker for the tart du jour.   You can also purchase baked goods to go. When friends or colleagues visit from out of town, we often don't have time to wait in line for brunch, but I like to send them home with a healthy assortment of croissants, pastries, and other treats.   The line can get long, but it moves fairly quickly. Cash only."}
{"text":"Showing up at about an hour before closing time on a Thursday, we had our choice of seating.  I had the Omelette du jour: roasted tomato, zucchini, spinach and mushroom, which was very tasty and consistent with my prior experiences. My wife had the signature French Toast, which is never a poor choice if you've a sweet tooth.  The food was delivered quickly and the presentation was quite pleasant.  The wait staff were very friendly and attentive.  This is certainly one of my favorite brunch places, assuming I can manage to avoid the typical long wait times for a table."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we check out Bonjour Brioche for some Saturday brunch, and as a lover of all things baked and bread, I can honestly say that it was great!  The place is pretty cozy, so it's fine if you're a small group, but the interior definitely doesn't fit too many people. (But that's also part of the charm!)  The wait wasn't too bad around midday, and the tasty smells coming from inside the place were enough to help us get through it until we were seated.  Service was awesome, our waitresses were all super helpful and friendly - and weren't pushy, even though we were hanging out and chatting well past finishing our food (bonus).  We ordered a chocolate croissant, and lemon-raspberry brioche to start, and both got grapefruit juice and the Croque Madame. Both the croissant and brioche were excellent - you could tell everything was fresh-baked. The Croque Madame was simple, but tasty, served with a nice light salad and little piece of baguette. We were so into it that we ended up also ordering a baguette w/jam and butter to share (which ended up finally being a bit too much food for us, but no regrets!).  All in all, loved the easy atmosphere and attentive service, and would seriously make the 35min bike trip all the way out here just to get my baguette/croissant/brioche fix. Spent a bit more than I wanted in the end, but that was pretty much an afterthought, and was worth it.  Thanks for a great East-end brunch experience, Bonjour Brioche!!"}
{"text":"I have been here on numerous occasions and have enjoyed the food everytime.  I have tried about 5 different dishes, all being excellent, but my favourite being the salmon with poached eggs.  Their salads are good, served with their very good signature dressing.  The croissants are very good.  The coffee is mediocre.  The place is small but very cozy, and as a result, fills in very quickly resulting in long line-ups that are worth the wait.  Thanks for providing a taste of Paris in Toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here while on a weekend trip to Toronto. YUM! Perfect brunch...Would definitely go back!! Had the ham and cheese brioche which was amazing and my husband had eggs with smoked salmon and caviar.   My mouth is watering, just at the thought.   Who cares that they write the menu on a blackboard, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was craving a croissant while wandering in Leslieville, but sadly they were already gone by 1 p.m. A few meagre specimens remained.  I settled on a lemon and raspberry brioche. For a namesake product, I was definitely not impressed. Dense and doughy instead of light and crispy. On the bright side, the filling was nice and tangy, but not enough to redeem it for me.  I guess I'll have to wake up earlier next time to evaluate the croissants and the full brunch."}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. Went here for Sunday brunch with the fam and it was the first beautiful day of what could be the start of Spring. There was a huge lineup and while we had to wait at least 40 minutes, my family was late meeting me so it was no big deal to wait outside (and did I mention how gorgeous the weather was?). I liked the fact that they had a takeout counter, so I grabbed a coffee before I waited in line!  They had a heated patio which was the perfect temperature for how bright and crisp it was outside. It's a bakery and a restaurant so they obviously have great baked goods. My party of three shared croissants (oh my god were they buttery and delicious) to hold us over until our mains came. We had caesars too. They were good, but we ordered them spicy so I would have liked to have seen them with more of a kick.  For my main I ordered scrambled eggs on potato rosti with smoked salmon and a little creme fresh and roe. It was delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked and all the flavours worked well together. It also came with baguette and this amazing butter which I'm assuming they make in-house. The server brought around a tray of amazing looking tarts asking if we wanted dessert. We didn't, but I thought it was a cool way to present it.  The mains could have come faster, but it was Sunday brunch so I was content to have a slower paced meal. I would definitely come back, to eat in and get take-out!"}
{"text":"Not much to say, other than everything here was on point!  Coffee (americano) was excellent, all the way down to the size and feel of the cup, scrambled eggs and baguette - eggs had zero grease and were light and fluffy, baguette was fresh with quality butter. Atmosphere on the patio was great (sun was shinning). Lastly, this review comes from me just returning from the South of France for a month, my standards/expectations are very high!"}
{"text":"Their croissants are so amazing. The wife and I always walk out with a bunch of them to take home after our meal. They always have specials on the chalkboard. First off, their fresh fruit juices are really good. We had the pear and ginger, which sounded odd at first, but when we actually drank it, it made me want to buy a juicer just to try and make it myself. I usually have the tuna salad on a milk bun, but I tried the pea meal sandwich. It was good but nothing out of the ordinary. If you ever get a chance to come across their tomato basil soup-GET IT. Get some to take home too. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm taking away a star, because the past few times I've visited, the service has been unacceptably poor. and noticeably worse than it was when I first started visiting a year and a half ago.    Recent 'final straws' for me:  - Waiting 45 minutes for our order and receiving a silent shrug of the shoulders and walk-away from the server when I politely pointed this out to him when the food finally arrived.  - I asked this morning how much a special was and was told $10.50.  I ordered the item based on that price as I am on a super-tight budget right now with a major holiday coming up. When I got the bill after eating the special item, the special ended up being $13.50. As if the server didn't know that when he quoted me the price.   It's douchebaggery like this that will turn me into a take-out-only customer from now on. (Fear not, the food is still outstanding)  Judging from the many recent reviews below criticising the service, it seems I'm not the only one feeling this way.   And maybe it's just me, but it seems that the place is less full now than it was a year ago. And their overall Yelp rating has shot way down.   Are the staff* deliberately told to be aloof and arrogant because they think that's the authentic French way, or something?! That's probably the reason behind their stupid cash-only policy, too. Ah, that's how they do it in France, apparently. Rubbish. Their desire to be authentic is losing them dine-in customers.  (*there are a couple of very nice girls who work here, I don't want to tar them all with the same brush)"}
{"text":"Love this place, very small and there is long wait on the weekends, but worth waiting. Also they only accept cash ."}
{"text":"I have been to BB a dozen times over the past few years.  I give it a 4 for its great food.  The omelettes are always tasty and fluffy, french toast is just amazing, and the pastries are so decadent.  Cannot go wrong with the food.  I do not go more often, even though we live so close, due to the cramped space inside.  There is a tiny patio area but it's not pleasant if it's super cold outside.  As well, the service has always been just meh.  They never seems to be that something extra.  It is worth going for the food.  If waiting and being in a cramped space is not your thing, get a baguette and some pastries to go."}
{"text":"A lil taste of France in Toronto.... Sigh.  Bonjour Brioche wasn't our destination, but when we walked by it, I wished it was.  Thankfully Lady Marmalade had a line up down the street so we returned to Bonjour Brioche..and I am glad we did!!  Although the atmosphere doesn't quite warrant 5 stars; we had a rickety table and I was stuck behind a door looking into the dingy backyard of something, or someone's home.  The food, was delicious!   Everyone in our party really really enjoyed the brunch.  I really wanted to try their pomegranate mimosa however they can't serve alcohol before 11 am, and we were a bit shy of that time frame.   At the end of our meal, there was a server who came by with some very delicious looking desserts which we had no room for, but we did take them to go.  We then stood in line to get some fresh breads which were amazing!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch/lunch. The bread is amazing. I recommend getting their fresh fruit juice, its the authentic stuff with a juicer.  Stay away from Baked French Toast, it will own your stomach with it's deliciousness.. I never thought something could be so insanely good that it's bad. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you are there for breakfast it's the wrong way to start to your day.  Also Bill Cosby has been there and signed an autograph... So like thats worth something right?"}
{"text":"It's hard to give an objective rating to Bonjour Brioche. There are many pros and cons about this place - perhaps the most popular brunch in up-and-coming Leslieville. In the end, it's probably most realistic to settle with 3 stars, no more or less. Too bad, since it's probably my first choice for brunch in the whole city.  Let's start with the bad: - VERY bad service. Up to the point that some of the servers are even rude. Coffee is brought to your table without any cream or milk, no cutlery (standard for the Toronto brunch places, who needs a fork and knife for breakfast these days?) - Umm, back to the coffee, when you ask for some milk, of course they never bring it. At least the cappuccino is ok... - Place is too small, tables are awkwardly positioned/ too near to each other and it's always packed. The whole atmosphere is somehow frantic (not at all what you would expect from a small French-style cafe/bakery/brunch), servers are running around nervously...  - Prepare cash!!! NO card is accepted (real 21st century style), and the cash machine downstairs is charging the most expensive fee you've ever seen for an ATM  However, the food is really good. Sandwiches are always fresh (try the beef!), salad is not bad at all, Croque Madam is amazing, brioche royale is a perfect dessert (arrive early for this one, always gets sold out!)... Omelets are perhaps one of the best in the city, pastry is baked fresh at premises, etc. You get the idea. Another plus is that it's relatively inexpensive as well, so for food you get really good value for the $$."}
{"text":"Tried brunch here today with the husband.   When we arrived we were asked to wait outside in the rain for a spot.  I asked if they took names and phone numbers...they didn't.  So be aware that you may have to wait on the patio for quite some time.  The wait was maybe 20 minutes...there was an awning so we didn't get wet.   My husband ordered coffee and when the coffee came, the rim of the cup was dirty...like it had been put upside down in a pile of dust.  I told the waitress about it and she gave me this weird look but gave us a new cup of coffee.  When she came back, she apologized to my husband for the dirty cup.   We ordered the daily soup, a chocolate croissant, the eggs benny and the croque madam.    The soup today was a potato and bacon soup. It was not cream based but it was definitely home made which was nice.  It came with a crostini and a piece of bread and butter.  The soup was good, not salty. The crostini was a little hard....definitely had to soak it into the soup.    We waited for 25 minutes between the soup and the entree.  Quite long in our opinion and in fact, the couple who was sitting next to us who sat down 10 minutes after us and ordered after us, got their food at the same time as us.   I got the eggs benny with the poached salmon.  The benny has a croissant as the base which I didn't really care for.  I know they're known here for their croissants but once the hollandaise sauce got onto it, it soaked down and became this sopping mush.  The croissant base doesn't hold up to a regular piece of bread or english muffin.  Otherwise, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise was good and the poached salmon was pretty standard.  The dish also came with a fresh salad and I have to say that the vinaigrette for the salad was delicious.  The dish also came with the same piece of bread and butter that came with the soup.  I felt like it was unnecessary to give the extra piece of bread and butter esp since there's already carbs present.  Considering this is a bakery, I didn't find the bread to be particularly fresh or tasty.   My husband got the croque madam.  He really didn't like this dish.  It was 2 pieces of brioche alternating with ham and then a fried egg on top.  He didn't enjoy the dish because he felt that there was too much bread and the bread itself wasn't particularly tasty.  He certainly was not impressed by the dish and furthermore, he felt his side salad was overdressed and therefore, quite salty.   We didn't receive our chocolate croissant and we assumed that maybe the server was going to give it to us to go or something.  So we asked for our bill and as it turns out, he didn't even hear our croissant order and it therefore wasn't on the bill.  We didn't feel up to correcting him and getting the croissant anymore so we let it go.  We spent about 40 dollars in total.   Overall, I liked my dish, but my husband didn't like his.  We both appreciated  how their soup was homemade.  I thought their service could be a bit better, perhaps a bit speedier and truthfully I would have appreciated if the waitress didn't give me a weird look when I told her about the dust on the cup as if I was crazy.  To be honest, I probably wouldn't come here again...maybe if I was in the area I would stop by to get a croissant but no more.  My husband certainly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We chose this place based on a top 10 list of best breakfast restaurants in Toronto - it was #2. We were lucky to get a seat, the place is small, crowded and busy! The table cloth was ratty and not very clean. The latte bowl was good and well priced. The croque madam was good but it was their version of it so don't expect a traditional French sandwich. The salad was overdressed. The breads (baguette, croissant and brioche) were average which is disappointing considering the place is a bakery. There is a line up of people standing indoors by the croissant/baguette cooling racks and there were people leaning against them so, yes, hair was touching food. Sadly I noticed that highlight after I ate the breakfast. They have a wall showcasing their awards, most are dated from the last decade so don't be fooled. Oh! And cash only."}
{"text":"We are kind of croissant nuts so we have had croissants at most places in Toronto. For some strange reason, about 75% of the time the croissants we get from Bonjour Brioche are burned. This is not a one-off experience, since we live near Leslieville we still stop by to pick up a plain and a chocolate a couple of times a month, and we expect mild degree of burnt.  Brunch food is decent; they do respectable versions of quiches, croque-madame, smoked salmon on potato rosti, etc, but the weekend line-ups are a bit out of control if you don't get there early. You will often be squeezed on benches with little elbow-room between yourself and strangers, which bothers some people and of course others won't mind.  For comparison our favourite place in TO for weekend brunch and croissants is Celestin up on Mt Pleasant. For some reason not many people have discovered it yet... But that's another review."}
{"text":"I like this place. I am amazed by their food, its tastily, and delicious. If it was on my way to work I would come here everyday for breakfast. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been to Brioche a few times, and although it is really tiny, and you may have to wait awhile it is worth the wait and then some.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, and inside it is pretty tight.  The food is delish!  I've had the spicy bacon sandwhich before, the pastries are a perfect combination of sweet and savoury, and the bread is to die for!  The staff do a great job of keeping up with the crowd, ensuring the orders are accurate and I've always had great service there.  I wish it was bigger as I tend to feel really squished in there, but overall it really is a nice spot to eat."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about brioche and finally decided to bite the bullet and drive 40 minute down just for brunch. After a 30 minute wait we finally got a table outside in their tiny patio area.  Our server was super patient with our questions about their menu, not that it was heard to read but everything looked amazing!  One thing you try is their almond croissants! Its fluffy and taste delicious!! Get them before noon else they will be sold out!"}
{"text":"If you want excellent quality brunch, breakfast, or lunch every time, this is where you go. They expect you to behave like an adult, so if you can't handle that, please don't blame it on the service. The last time I went, I had the croque madame (wonderful) and my friends had the tourtière (divine) and the scrambled eggs with lox (which is great, and my usual order). We always start with a blueberry brioche. I think the wait staff know what they are doing and understandably have little patience for Toronto's many annoying diners. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot period.  Everything is baked fresh and their daily specials are incredibly creative.  The chocolate croissants are also to die for.  Try not to go on a weekend because the lines are long.  Weekdays are fine."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now for breakfast. I am not a pastry fan so I guess this is the wrong place for me because according to my son they are \"to die for\". The breakfast was ok nothing special.   I had the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon the first time. Comes with a salad and two small pieces of baguette. The baguette was better than the eggs. Crusty and soft inside so fresh, delicious. The eggs were under cooked for me. The next time I had an omelette, one of their specials, and once again the eggs were undercooked and unedible for me. Runny inside...gag.  Stingy on the gruyere cheese filling as well. The baguette pieces excellent! Salad was fresh and lightly dressed.  The staff is friendly and the service is average. It WOULD have been helpful to know that they take CASH ONLY. Who carries cash now? At least put up a sign or something, don't wait until my bill comes and then inform me of this inconvenience.  I would buy up all the bread in this place but will not order eggs again until they learn how to cook them from raw to done. Also don't be so stingy with the fillings.  If you are a fan of pastries and breads worth the trip. As I was only here for breakfast I was unaware they were licensed."}
{"text":"Cars can drive themselves, solar energy is a common thing, robots can do surgeries, yet we still have to pay cash at this establishment. Food and service is great, but come on, stop evading taxes and putting the bill on your paying customers to use your Abm machine."}
{"text":"It's finally a beautiful Spring day (not sure if it will last but at least it was on a Sunday and not a workday). We went for Brunch at the east end to Leslieville. There was a line up outside the restaurant but we were lucky, there were 2 available seats on the patio and asked if anyone is interested. Of course we were!!! And it is a nice sunny day today so why not sit outside. Therefore, we didn't end up waiting that long, about 15 minutes or so only.  The patio seats were pretty tight and our seats were right at the entrance so lots of people walking by. It was hard to decide what to try. I got the mushroom / arugula / swiss cheese tart. And since their brioche is well known, I got the blueberry brioche (I wanted to try the raspberry lemon one but they were out). The bread was good, but I have a feeling the raspberry one would taste better as there will be more filling, next time?  For my tart, it was nice and hot. I love the tart crust, very flaky. The filling was packed with mushroom, arugula, cheese and egg custard. I wish there were a bigger piece. It came with a side of mixed greens and baguette. The baguette was good, but wish it came with some butter or jam or something to eat it with. It was a very healthy portion, lots of greens, and small portion of tart. I was full after but not stuffed."}
{"text":"I just finished the last piece of croissant we got from this place yesterday. What I can say is simply that that's just not enough!   My husband and I are croissant fans and always in search of good bakeries. I would venture to say this is almost the best croissant I have ever tasted outside Europe. We ordered butter and chocolate ones for only $1.8 each. They are soft and crispy with the generous use of butter. Incredible! We ordered four more after our brunch there. Now we kinda have regrets that we should have had more!  During our travel in Toronto, we went to the restaurant in a late Sunday morning after checking Yelp. It was almost lunch time and the line was long to wait for a seat. Actually there were always people waiting the whole time. I would say if you are not in a rush, it is totally worth it.  We ordered fresh juice made of cucumber-lime and mango-tangerine, fresh and refreshing. Meals were recommended by the waitress as weekend special - check out the black board on the wall to find more! I had spicy bacon sandwich which was composed of pieces of sweet and spicy bacon toasted with brown sugar and spice, plus my favorite avocado. The baguette with it was crispy but not too hard. It came also together with salad dressed with a nice flavored sauce. I actually burned my tongue unfortunately the day before, but food still found its way to the five star tasting experience, amazing. I also shared a piece of my husband's salmon egg benedict which is also great. The brunch completed with a plate o their home made pastry - the choices all looked so tempting but we only had room for one. The cherry cake tasted wonderful and not rich at all, even after a big meal!  I would strongly recommend this place for its wonderful food and nice service. But just be prepared for the waiting and get some cash beforehand."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. Simply tasty, well put together, unique and no fuss food. The croque madam and quiche lorrain are by far my favourites. But I have tried many other items on the menu and never have been disappointed. The baguettes and baked goods are one of the best in Toronto. You get much better quality food in this place than most 4-star pretentious places on King/Queen west and Yorkville hotels (Four Seasons included). The draw back is the place is very small, but that would not be a big deal if the service was not so poor. The only reason I am not giving them 5-stars is their utter lack of respect for customers. They are (the owner included) consistently rude to customers and treat them as if they are owed something.  I even flat out asked one of the girls at the counter why she was being so rude (I caught her in a lie telling me at the end of the day that they had no sandwiches left for take out, because she did not want to bother to even take my money and ring it in!) she I asked her: seems like you guys are not that big on service? Very dismissively she shook her head and said: no, we don't care."}
{"text":"I was actually planning to go to Lady Marmalade just down a block for brunch, but it was way too busy on a Sunday morning. Bonjour Brioche wasn't a lot less busy either, but my sister and I opted to sit in their \"heated patio\" to avoid waiting for 30 mins. However, when it's -20C, the outdoor heater could only do so much. So we were in agony the whole time we're waiting for food. When my food finally arrived, it's all worth it. I had the salmon egg benedict - the egg was poached to perfection. My sister order a chicken sandwich, and it's very bland and flavorless in contrast. The bread was hard and chicken breast was very tough. Not sure if it's worth the price. The pastry she got afterwards made up for the bland sandwich though.  The service was just okay. Our server tried to move us to a table further away from the heater to accommodate a larger group who came after us. I mean I understood why, but c'mon, it's -20C out there.  It's good food, no doubt, but I'm not sure if it deserves the \"best brunch\" title."}
{"text":"Bonjour, you've redeemed yourself and earned the 5 stars I know you deserve.   I went with the quiche that I know and love and it didn't disappoint. My friend ordered the french toast. It's hearty serving so she shared some of it with me - that is some damn good french toast! It's a thick cut cinnamon bread and it's not at all greasy. It's the kind of thing you just can't stop eating because it would be a crime for any of it to go to waste.   Dilemma, dilemma - what will I order next time???"}
{"text":"Somebody has really got to break the giddy, flippant balloon this place is flying.  Very very costly.  Food entirely questionable.  I ordered what on the menu board was called \"poached eggs with smoked salmon\"---period.  It came drowned in a sweetly-dressed salad that I had to eat some of to be able to get at my eggs----but as a diabetic I didn't need or want the dressing.  But I wasn't expecting ANY salad as per the menu.  My partner ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, for which they used not only provolone but **smoked provolone, although this, too, wasn't specified on the menu.  The manager showed up and smirked at us, as though we were too stupid to appreciate the grand cuisine.  No wondering why one of the plates had hardly been touched.  Highly NOT recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Bonjour Brioche for Sunday brunch with some friends, since it is supposed to be very good there. However, this was one of those places where after going, one cannot help wondering what all the fhype is about. The place is very tiny, and super busy. They take reservations but if you have the misfortune of one of your  friends being  bit late they take the table away and you need to stand in line. Plus, you actually risk having to wait outside in the cold. A girl standing in line behind me said she needed a table for two, the waitress asked where was the second person and the girl said her boyfriend was just parking the car. \"Do you want to call him?\" asked the waitress!!!!!!! The guy was parking the car, how long could he take??? As I said, the place is super tiny so the tables are all very close to each other, so if your intention is to have a private conversation, forget it. There, you basically have to eat with strangers, which may or may not be pleasant. The overall service was also not good. The employees have this (bad) attitude as if they were working in the best Café in Paris (clearly not the case).  And what about the food? After all of this one would expect it to be amazing...but unfortunately it is not. It is just OK.  Finally, when you're done eating, it becomes pretty clear you're expected to leave as soon as possible. I, for sure will not be coming back and my advice for you, if your idea is  to have a relaxed and delicious Sunday brunch, is to either find some other place, or, buy some groceries, some nice eggs, cold cuts, arugula, mushrooms, nice bread, some juice, etc,  and prepare brunch yourself, for you and your friends. You can probably prepare something as good or better and you eliminate all the unnecessary stress."}
{"text":"Consistently great croissants and other flaky, buttery French pastries, as well as other must have brunch items.  Staff and friendly and efficient, which they have to be, as this place is always packed to the rafters.  Getting their early and in the summer, where there are more options due to the side patio, is recommended.  Probably the most authentic baguette you will get outside of Paris.  The raspberry and custard stuffed brioche (Royale) are a must."}
{"text":"Worst service in the city.   We have gone back many times despite the fact the service has always been bad because the food is generally excellent but our most recent experience was the last straw.   After waiting about 35 min (not the end of the world) we finally got a table. 30 minutes AFTER we ordered they told us that they ran out of the quiche I wanted. We politely  asked how long they thought it would be to re-order because we had already been waiting awhile and the person (I assume it was one of the cooks) snapped back at us that she could just bring us the bill for our lattes and we could leave if we were so concerned about time.   We said we would take another look at the menu and she shoved it into my hands, rolled her eyes, made a some grand gestures with her hands as if she was so inconvenienced and then literally stomped away.    After this, a waiter came to tell me there was no more quiche and I'd have to re-order. Then the owner came to tell me the same thing. There is obviously an incredible lack of communication amongst the staff here and it negatively impacts the whole experience.  We then waited quite a bit for our meals. At this point it was over an hour into being at the table and our waters or coffees weren't refilled the entire time. We asked three different wait staff if we could have more water before finally getting it, while people at neighbouring tables complained amongst themselves and other about the atrocious service (wrong orders delivered to tables, no cutlery, mistakes on the bills were what we heard from the tables beside us).   All of these things on their own aren't big deals. Mistakes happen, especially when it's a busy day. But it always seems to be one thing after another at this place and we have almost always left feeling insulted or upset with the service. This was our last time...the food is not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Alright Eastend. Calm down with this whole \"you've got the best brunch\" thing you've got going for you. I was not very impressed with BB. It was busy, the selection seemed homogeneous (egg with chive/cheese and brioche), serving was small, our server looked like he was from a steampunk convention, and I had to run to the bank for cash because they don't accept plastic.   Average meal. Still was hungry. Ate a crepe on the way home.  Fuckin' steampunk!?"}
{"text":"We woke up hungry and hungover yesterday, so we decided to hit up Bonjour Brioche for a meal big and delicious enough to soak up the alcohol of the night before. There were three of us, and we arrived at BB around 1:00pm, and saw a line up. Surprisingly, this line moved quickly and we were given a table less than 10mins into our wait.   The server came around and told us the drink specials, and then left while we looked at the menus and made up our minds. We decided on the Spicy bacon sandwich with avocado and tomato, the croque madame, poached eggs with hollandaise and smoked salmon, and baked french toast for the table to share. We also got 2 pomegranate mimosas, two cappuccinos and 2 croissants to nosh on while we waited for the massive amounts of food that we ordered.   We were seating in the patio (not by choice) and it was chilly, so when we saw a table closer to the entrance become available, we decided to switch. We asked the waitress and she became visibly annoyed that we'd wanted to move. But we were cold! She sighed loudly and said \"fine, I'll clean it\". Our cappuccino's came out a few minutes later, along with our mimosas, but no croissants. The waitress then disappeared, and did not come back until a few minutes later with out respective plates. We asked about the croissant's and were told that she'd go check on them.   Now, on to the food: The Croque Madame was OK. This is basically 2 slices of brioche with smoked ham and Gruyere, and a fried egg on top. The brioche was dry and a bit mealy, and there wasn't enough Gruyere to actually make a difference on the taste. Not impressed. On a more positive note, the greens were fresh and the vinaigrette light and delicious, I really enjoyed it.   The Spicy Bacon Sandwich: This was frigging' good! I really liked it. Fresh baguette, with salty bacon, fresh tomatoes and ripe avocado, yum!! Totally delicious.   The Poached Eggs with Hollandaise and Smoked Salmon: Also OK. I wasn't impressed with the Hollandaise, it was lemony and not terrible, but it also didn't knock my socks off, like I was expecting. I was a bit disappointed. However, I'm not sure if this is my own fault as maybe I'm just not ever really impressed by breakfast items. So I've decided to make a commitment to trying out a new brunch/breakfast spot every week and see if there's any out there that can really blow me away. I'll report.   The french toast: Yummmmmmmmmm.....absolutely mind blowing delicious goodness! This was purrrfect! We were meant to share it amongst the 3 of us, but I ended up eating most of it. Moist, sweet enough but not cloying, cinnamony, and caramely. Just divine! I'm salivating just thinking of it! The fruit it came with was pretty gross ( bitter cantaloupe, 2 grapes and mushy watermelon cubes). And if this had come with fresh berries or any other *fresh* fruit, it would had been THAT much better.   The mimosas were good, and the cappuccinos had chocolaty goodness on them, but were lukewarm when served to us, and I like my coffee hot.   At the end of our meal, a different waiter came by with a tray of tarts and gave us a description of each and asked us if we wanted any. We were stuffed at this point, but couldn't resist trying at least one. We got the sour cherry tart, and it was meh. The filling was a bit mushy, and the cherries weren't tart enough.   The croissants we asked for never came, and they also didn't show up on our bill, which is good. However, I wasn't impressed with the fact that our server never did find out what happened to them. We would have asked for them to go, but at this point we were too full to be able to imagine eating them, and we didn't want them to become soggy before we got to them.   All in all, the food was ok. 2 really good dishes, and 2 lacklustre ones. I do want to try out BB again, but next time I want to have their beef bourguignon, which the guy on the table next to us got and it looked delicious! Also, I really want to try their quiches and other sweet tarts. I'll return, but I'll be staying away from anything too \"breakfasty\"."}
{"text":"I am French, so finding a great baguette is a big deal for me. I also live in Canada, so now brunch is ALSO a big deal for me (not so much in France). Now combine the two and you get Bonjour Brioche.   I've only been here once, something like a year ago, since it's totally on the opposite side of town for me, but I still remember this brunch perfectly. Best one I've ever had. I think it was a special, salmon Eggs Benedict on a croissant. It came with a side salad and a generous piece of fresh baguette. BON APPETIT! It was absolutely yummy. Treated myself to a tiny tart for dessert. The bill was not even that high. It was crowded, but we got lucky enough that a couple was living right as we arrived so we got seated right away. All in all, it was an amazing experience, and I can't wait to go back, because I dream of this brunch at night.   A friend also brought me a pain au chocolat from there one day and it was perfect, a real French one (unlike what you can find in other overpriced fancy pseudo-French bakeries). I only wish I lived closer, or that they would open other locations in Toronto."}
{"text":"Favourite East side brunch spot. Long line ups but better including food than at Lady Marmalade close by. Cute patio and interior. Love the large latte bowls and french pastries the brunch is served on."}
{"text":"Straight up the best breakfast in Toronto! The french toast is to die for, the coffee is great, and the croissants will make you come back over and over again. Be prepared for a long line up on weekends, but it's worth it. Get there by 9am if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes and some family budded in front of ours. I live down the street and always come here. Never again."}
{"text":"Good in terms of food, with very good bread and croissants. Gives a nice, authentic french feel. However, the service was sub-par 3 times I've been there (pretty unpleasant an un-friendly waiting staff - partially understandable due to the amount of work and customers), and wait times have ben of at least 20-30 mins each."}
{"text":"With very limited seating and what is arguably the best French toast in Toronto, it's easy to see why brunchers are often lined up around the block at Queen and DeGrassi streets.  The dining is intimate, the service friendly and the patio private.  Go early to avoid disappointment!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 10/10  Yelp must have some holy influence on the food community in Toronto, because after reading scathing reviews of the (lack of) service in this place, I expected to go and find rude, unaccommodating staff. However, the staff at Bonjour Brioche were lovely in nature, put the customer first, and overall helped make the experience!  The baguette here is a must try. Anything with a baguette really. I had a breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheese, and proscuitto. The baguette was fresh, deliciously crunchy and soft at the same time. Perfection!   It will be a bit of a wait - we arrived at 2:30 on a Saturday (they close at 4) and still had to wait for about 25 minutes. That being said, we did turn down the opportunity to eat on the heated patio outside - it was freezing!   THE BOTTOM LINE: service has taken a turn for the better and the baguettes/food here is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Before going to this cute little spot in leslieville I drove by many times and the line up was out the door. I definitely don't want to stand in line for brunch but had to find out what all the hype was about. I went on a Wednesday at around 11:00 am and success no line. It's a cute spot with a nice little patio on the side. The seating was kind of awkward by the door but I was just happy to have a seat outside. We started with Pomegrante Mimosas which were delicious. I ordered the Quiche of the Day which was Quiche Lorrene. I make Quiche regularly and order it all the time...it's one of my favourites. This Quiche was out of this world!! And the salad OMG I never thought I would like salad so much, I wish I bought the dressing from inside. My friend had the French Toast which was also amazing, aparently they take all there left over pasteries from the night before rip them up and combined them together to make almost like a bread pudding....bottom line TO DIE FOR. I think the food is worth the line up. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bonjour Brioche, I want to wake up to your croissants.  Buttery. Flaky. Delicious.  Crunch. Mmmm.  I have to say, I didn't miss lining up at Lady Marmalade at all.    The menu has brunch items along with quiche and other great lunch items. I ordered smoked salmon with scrambled eggs on rosti. It was heavenly!  The salmon and creamed horse radish and caviar was a magical combination.   The rosti was hot and crispy and added heartiness to breakfast. I found my breakfast light and there was still room for dessert!  ...Dessert that they bring to your table! The waiter brought over a small but impressive showcase of their desserts.  I gave into temptation.  Bonjour, creme brule tart! Served up with creme fresh, it was my favourite dessert in tart form.  It even had a crackable crispy caramelized sugar top.  What a perfect end to a fantastic brunch!  Ah Bonjour Brioche, a la prochaine! (kiss, kiss)"}
{"text":"I tried their croissant before and it was not fresh.  But I figured I would give it another try.    I went there today, but since the menu did not appeal to my husband, I decided to pick up some croissants and coffee before heading to another sit down breakfast place.  I walked in to the front cash and waited to be served and the server ignored me.  And I was the only one at the cash.  He even served two people who came in after me.  Go figure. He didn't seem to care to serve me, so we just left.  Never again.  Hey if you don't want to give everyone proper civilized respect then hey I will go somewhere else to spend my money.  Incidentally, the breakfast place we ended up at was great with hospitable customer service."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Toronto.  The croissant's are the best (close second is Clafouti on the other end of Queen near Shaw, and Rahier on Bayview).  I generally just do take out for baked goods so I can't really comment on the cafe section.  The coffee is excellent and of course you have to try their delicious brioche.    You gain 5 lbs just looking at their buttery and flaky croissants."}
{"text":"Bread is good. Service is OK. Restaurant is VERY drafty. Washrooms are dirty. Currently in vogue, but does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Uptight French bistro with a set of lunch and sandwich options. Smells nice and buttery from outside, and looks homestyle from the inside. Come early on the weekends or don't bother dining in. The service is on another level of French sovereignty (lol) Don't speak French? Prepare for slower service. Absolutely do not come with coffees or water bottles from outside! They'll make you pour it into a glass. While the food appears to be made with care the aloof service on the patio did little ease the chilly and damp spring morning my friend and I visited. I dont really remember what I had much, except that my baguette was rather tough. The madeleines or buns are just ok. I think Nadege does them better."}
{"text":"Considero o Melhor Croissant (butter, chocolat, savory) que experimentei ate hoje. Massa e o preparo sao diferenciados! Bom atendimento."}
{"text":"An exceptional brunch.  I Yelped \"mimosas\" and Bonjour Brioche surfaced to the top of the list.  We had our hopes up, but learned that they don't start serving alcohol until 11am.  This began as a bit of a disappointment, but it was more than made up for by the exceptional food.    I had one of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted. Spicy bacon with avocado, tomato, gruyerre and chipotle aioli - served on a toasted baguette with a side salad.  Amazing.  Completed with a latte bowl and I was completely satisfied.  I'll definitely be back.  note: they only take cash."}
{"text":"I got dragged here and didn't expect to enjoy it since it isn't my kind of food but it ended up being delicious. I didn't have a bad experience with the waiter but it definitely seems like no one there enjoys their job. It doesn't surprise me that there's so many negative reviews about the service."}
{"text":"Pastries are awesome!! Service is ok. I love bread and rare beef sandwich!! So good! Atmosphere is nice and old country style. But bit hard to stay with kids."}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday brunch.  Service was A1.  Very extensive menu.  I had Eggs Bene and was totally impressed.  My Caesar was also very good.  Definately worth the trip to Leslieville.  I will return."}
{"text":"Finally my 50th food review. I've been trying to hold off writing my 50th until I could review a place I could give a high rating to. After days of contemplation and deep meditation, this pointless honor goes to none other than Bonjour Brioche, my current fave croissant in Canada.  It is the most buttery of all croissants I've tasted which is a plus for me but a minus for my overall health. I know something is good if I prefer it plain over other variations. (Ex: Plain croissant over almond/chocolate croissant; simple steak over steak with gravy and other sauces, etc). This particular croissant fits the bill. Its flaky, it's still good after heating it up in the oven, it's awesome. It probably also helps that for some reason, it is the only croissant I've had so far that I ate while freshly baked which could be a big reason for my bias.  My biggest pet peeve about this place is the awful dining situation they have here. Parking options are terrible, dinner area is microscopic and always full, and the drive I have to make to get here isn't the most favorable.  I'd give the establishment a 2, but I like the croissant so much it adds 2 points all by itself."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant from BlogTO after my daughter suggested to have croissant for our last breakfast in Toronto.  We ordered their omelette and quiche specials that day.  I pride myself in making a very good quiche, but their quiche blew me away.  It was the lightest and fluffiest quiche I ever had in my life!  My daughter's omelette was cooked perfectly, too.  Our food server was very friendly and attentive.  This is now on our go-to place for breakfast even though it's out of the way."}
{"text":"Best croissants in town. Huge pieces of quiche, big bowls of brunch-y-ness. I started with a baguette and butter and jam. Then, I had a gorgeous fig and blue cheese tart. The tarts and quiches change with what is available.  Ingredients are top notch!  I agree with other posters. Do not come with your five best friends. All the couples will get seats before you and you'll just stress out over when that other table of 5 is leaving.  Get take out and go to the local parks or shops along this cute block of Queen E.  Coffee is the only thing that does not stand out as something to remember."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but service was horrible. This is my first time rating any place less than five stars.  I was surprised, given how well they're received. We had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for simple things like getting the menu and the bill. They forgot parts of my order, and I had to ask three times for a coffee refill before eventually receiving it."}
{"text":"Great place. Met some friends for Brunch. Everything served was yummy!!! Loved their freshly baked breads and sweet treats..Will Definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best \"home cooked\" food ever. I especially love the soups. The weekend wait can be long, it usually takes forever to get a table for 2. Good luck with a big group --you could be waiting forever unless you get there before 8:00 am. Don't shower before you go. You will stink like breakfast, bacon and eggs all day. However, it would be worth it if you don't care."}
{"text":"I met up with a few friends here for Sunday brunch one weekend I was visiting Toronto. It was their idea and as soon as we saw the line, we wanted to turn back and try somewhere else. Let me just tell you, it was definitely worth the wait!   When we were finally up, we were seated outside on the deck under some mighty fine heat lamps so we didnt freeze to death. Actually, I might even say it felt too hot there. Oh well. I finally was able to commit to a menu option and got the Croque Madame with a hot cidery adult beverage the waiter recommended. OH MAN! That was a fulfilling brunch. I was actually surprised that the food came out so fast and accurate since the place was packed.  Id definitely come here again with some friends. Maybe this time ill come a bit earlier so I may avoid a line.   Croque Madame, ill be dreaming of you..."}
{"text":"I was very excited about going to this place, but my experience was rather disappointing. 1. The menu isn't that exciting, but I guess that depends on your taste.  2. The place is rather pricy considering the quality of the food.  3. The service isn't great (it's OK - less than standard). 4. Although it's nice that they are \"old fashioned\", it's inconvenient to find out they it's CASH ONLY when it's time to pay.  5. My husband had a horrible stomach ache right after having a meal there (I don't want to blame it on the food, but we couldn't think of any other cause) 6. On a positive note, the food looked good and tasted relatively good ( but I've had far better brunches, even at franchises such as Cora's)"}
{"text":"Nice location and quite a nice vibe, but the food is only passable and the service is nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't make sense to me.  It's certainly not a full fledge restaurant where an entrée will actually fill you up.  It's more like an over priced bakery that serves light meals (soups & sandwiches) along with their baked goods.  I guess they think that by adding some alcohol to the menu they are now a real restaurant.    From my experience eating here, it was fairly uncomfortable because they have tried to maximize customer occupancy by cramming as many tables together so tight that you can barely walk between them without knocking/bumping into something or someone.  This place would be a nightmare for someone who requires a mobility device or if baby got back.  The food is by far anything extraordinary.  Their baked goods are okay especially the baguettes and I do like the apple tarte tatin.  But what's keeping them in business is the hipster vibe clientele they are targeting.  All the power to you but to me you're just an average bakery charging inflated prices and as an afterthought, a soup/sandwich place for hipsters to hangout."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Great patio. Must try their croissants - very yummy. Go early as it gets busy. Cash only so bring dollah dollah bills, yo."}
{"text":"This cafe-bakery already gets enough praise so I'll keep it short. Go for brunch, go get a baguette or just go eat a doughnut. I do all three.   Bonjour Brioche makes these sinfully delicious jelly doughnuts called the Brioche Royale. If you're lucky you can get there in time to eat a fresh one. Timing is everything. Regardless, they're so good I thought about buying clothes one size up to compensate for the added weight. I enjoy their doughnuts that much...they are dirrrrtyyy good."}
{"text":"Great food, worth the wait. Their chocolate brioche needs more oozey, melty chocolate."}
{"text":"This is a dirty little place where the service is bad, the attitude from the wait staff is uncalled for, the food is mediocre at best and the clientele look like they are on break from an Abercrombie commercial. Everyone looks and dressed the same, no creativity. I'm not sure what the attraction is and I often wonder how a place like this could possibly get good reviews. How can the patrons have such limited exposure in a city like Toronto and think this place is good.  I blame it on what I call the MacDonald's Generation, raised on MacDonald's so anything taste good because their taste buds are tainted. I felt like I walked onto a set of the stepford wives. No emotion on anyones face.  I know this sounds harsh but I'm describing what I experienced.  I'm not making this up.  The food preparation area looks dirty.  \"shaking my head\""}
{"text":"went here a number of times. The food is good (not to die for) most of the time, chocolate croissants lack chocolate,  and owner always has an attitude. That said, you might be better off coming here instead of Lady Marmalade."}
{"text":"Moray time. Nice little space.delicious blueberry brioche. Looking forward to go back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years so this morning's experience was a real disappointment. We ordered 2 small lattes, french toast and an almond croissant. Lattes arrived and were not hot, really only just warm and very weak in coffee.  We should have called back our waitress but we were too engaged in talking to let it register and had already downed one of them. I remember the french toast which I recommended to my sister visiting from California was formerly made of brioche. What she got was a heavy bread pudding. The only good item was my lovely croissant. And mentioning the less than adequate latte? We were told we shouldn't have drunk them in a rather curt manner as if the problem was ours!! So driving 30 minutes to get there after raving about the great little cafe - meh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with the toddler, both times fairly good experiences. Given that the place is always full, we found very good seats both times. The service staff is a bit late to attend to tables, not much of a problem because they are very friendly and knowledgable.  The food is good, nothing exceptional but the taste is there. Croque Madame, their Provencale omelette and Benny are their above average meals."}
{"text":"Very sweet little place. We sat outside on their lovely patio and started with a delicious cauliflower soup. The server recommended the spicy bacon sandwich and although it was good, I preferred the Benedict we ordered along with it. Get there early or you will wait in line!"}
{"text":"THEEEE most delicious croissant I've tasted in Toronto.   That's really the main point of this whole review. Go there. Get a croissant.  Do it.   Okay, I'll elaborate a teensy bit. I've had the plain croissants, the chocolate croissants, and various fruity yummy pastries here. The brioche is great too! The servers don't even mind explaining to you what a brioche is ;)   I can't say I've gone in for a proper meal other than pastries. But I checked out the menu and it looks good too. I definitely want to pop in for a bite at lunch and try a croque madam or a yummy looking sandwich.  Careful, it's usually busy."}
{"text":"Reviews seemed to be mixed, - but I don't think it's fair to the people who give it a low review.  The seating is rather limited in the winter, the patio double's its size, there can only be fifteen tables in the restaurant - so of course good food attracts people, and people don't like to wait too long for good food.    I used to work around the corner, so for lunch, it was easy to get in and get out un-scathed - the entire menu is delicious - though I recommend the custard tarts over anything - and the marmalade - it is the only place that warms my brunch soul."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I were on our way to Lady Marmalade for brunch, but after finding out it would be a 45 mins wait we backtracked to Bonjour Brioche. I'm really glad we ended up here because this place smells like freshly baked bread and all things fried in butter. So much butter. Also, a very small lineup. We were seated right away. It's a very small space and the patio is quite packed in, especially for Saturday brunch. After reviewing the specials I decided to go with the Grilled cheese with egg, prosciutto and tomato on olive bread. It was delicious and filling. However, the real star of the show was the salad dressing on the side salad that accompanied my sandwich. It was perfectly dressed and really well seasoned. They sell it at the front if you're looking to pick it up. You should also give the freshly made fruit juices a try - the one with mango is quite good.   At the end of our meal, the server came over to us with a tray of delicious tarts and cakes and asked us if we were ready for dessert. This is very clever and very cruel. How could we say no?! We each picked a tart to go, they come to $5 each. Definitely worth it. After getting our treats we ended up standing in line for some more baked goodies because we couldn't leave without trying their freshly baked croissants, and baguettes. I think we picked up about half a dozen items for less than $10!   So to summarize, fantastic place for brunch. I don't think you can go wrong with any item off their menu/specials. Don't leave without grabbing their baked goodies to go. And, the salad dressing is divine.   I'll be back to grab some of their cakes. Can't wait! FYI - this place is cash only, and the crowd really picks up around 11am on the weekend."}
{"text":"My entire experience at this little resto was less than pleasant. The food was not great, the service added nothing positive to the experience, and the management was rude. Coffee was not refilled - which should be somewhat of an expectation when ordering drip coffee at a breakfast/ brunch joint. I wouldn't come back - do yourself a favour a don't bother either. Also I'm still hungry :("}
{"text":"New to the area and came to try out this place seeking a go to brunch spot. Let me start by saying the only positive thing was our server, despite being incredibly busy definitely serving 10+ tables he managed to hold it together and did his best. Inside was busy so we sat on the patio, it was toasty with heaters on so I actually didn't mind. Only issue was the patio tables had these weird dirty fabric table cloths on them. There would be no way to clean them between guests. Yikes.    We both ordered eggs Benedict w peamale - which automatically comes with a heaping salad of spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette. Kind of messed up that they don't warn you about this and at least offer a choice of a potato side instead of assuming everyone who wants eggs benedict also wants a massive mushy salad when you order a hearty greasy breakfast item but hey I get it theyre a different kinda place. I still wish I got the potatoe thing .... Ultimate sadness. Rookie mistake on my part.....   Anyways, food took a VERY long time to come out. 30 mins + It made my friend late for work actually, and what we received was not worth the wait.   Eggs Benedict is served on a croissant, which completely ruins it from the start. It just mushes up and falls apart. Peamale was good ! Egg was also poached perfectly. The sauce could have saved this one for me - but unfortunately was the nail in the coffin of my brunch experience. Bland and barely any hollandaise ! A dry eggs Benedict how lovely - I asked for a side of hollandaise - it came out freezing cold in a silver ramican. Like I want to put cold hollandaise sauce on my Luke warm breakfast? What the actual F? Again none of this was the servers fault he actually was a great server , but I've had more flavorful and satisfying meals from golden griddle. Higher hopes to try Lady Marmalade next time. Can't believe people were lined up for this place !"}
{"text":"Really amazing spot for brunch. You have to go early or else wait in line. Such is life when you want a great brunch at a small spot! I've always felt the service is attentive and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Having never actually sat down for a meal, I have on two occasions walked in to take out their delicious croissants. The reason for the low rating is their lack of concern for keeping things hygienic/bug free and their poor attitude when I brought it to their attention. While trying to decide which croissants to purchase, we noticed that there were multiple (3+) bees licking their way around the tarts and pies on the counter. I guess we were naïve to think they hadn't noticed but when I brought it to my server's attention both he AND another server both acknowledged they were aware of the problem. Their non-chalant reply was \"yeaaaaah, we know. Nothing we can do about it\".  ummmm maybe some pie covers and putting the tarts under a glass cover?! I've worked in a (high end) bakery and we have always had things covered up. If there was a noted fly/insect on a product, we quickly disposed of the product and wouldn't sell it to our customers?!? Like I said - their croissants are delicious, I can't speak much to their brunch menu but I really hope something is done about the way they approach cleanliness."}
{"text":"Can't wait to return to Toronto so I can come back to Bonjour Brioche.  It was worth the 40 minute walk from our hotel, the King Eddy, through several interesting neighborhoods.  Didn't mind standing in line on a Saturday morning for an over-the-top eggs benedict.  The pastries are indescribable!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Having driven by this place a few times and always seeing the long line-ups, I had high expectations for my Sunday brunch. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait once we got there and were seated right away, probably because it was already after 2 pm. Our waiter quickly told us the specials (one being this hot chocolate with real Belgian chocolate and some type of liquor which ended up being pretty tasty), and took our orders.  I had the fruit salad with yoghurt granola and honey, which satisfied me. It even had some pomegranate bits, so I was glad to see them using seasonal fruits. Because I was going to go to get a proper latte after brunch, I only ordered a coffee which did not taste fresh at all. The French toast was tiny with two little slices, and they forgot to bring me my brioche.Once I got my brioche, it was the tiniest brioche ever known to mankind!!!! I was confused actually, as the ones from the bakery upfront looked way bigger. Actually, I liked our waiter, I guess this place is just too busy!! Cute ambiance though."}
{"text":"Best French brunch I've had in years. This despite standing outside in the freezing cold with about fifteen other determined Sunday brunchers waiting for a table.   Crowded noisy interior, but it's got that magic state where you have a sense of intimacy with your date despite the cramped tables, perhaps because of the charming warm decor? Or maybe it's the lusciousness of the chocolate croissants and other pastries in the beautiful display case. How French pastries can create a sense of intimacy with a date may explain more about my love of food than is discreet, but there it is.  The service can be a bit rushed, but professional. I get the sense the owner has a firm hand on the till(er), and would have it no other way. Or maybe the rest of the week is quiet, so they've really gotta pack 'em in on the weekends? Still worth the wait, provided you're not with hangry company."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Tuesday (we both happened to be off work). The restaurant was busy, but there were some tables available on the patio, so we ate there. The patio has a few different sets of chairs - ours were metal folding ones that were not at all stable but we managed. The food was tasty - I had the Croque Madam and my friend had the baked French Toast. The Croque came with a salad and the French Toast came with some fresh fruit, which I would have preferred to the salad. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time - overall the service was decent. We were not offered refills of our glasses of water, but really, other than that we had no issues with service."}
{"text":"Truly Parisian cafe. Excellent food. Some of the best croissants and breads in the city. But, living up to the stereotype of Parisian contemptible disinterest, the service is stubbornly deplorable.   Despite being in the financial capital of the country with the highest per capita use of cards, only cash is accepted. Despite bring 25 minutes away from downtown, it opens too late in the morning for the average employed person to comfortably enjoy a weekday breakfast.  Despite closing earlier than any other eatery in the city, arriving within the last 45 minutes of service will mean being subjected to the cleaning smells, sounds and the bustle of closing routines while the tables nearby are pressed into duty as work spaces. And, since you are daring to keep them from an early departure, expect contemptuous glares and further degradation of their normally low service quality.   On our visit the server managed to get the order wrong, get it wrong again, arrive at our table while chewing food - I never realized what a turn off that could be, btw - and add additional unordered and undelivered items to our bill.  Enjoy a true taste of Paris!"}
{"text":"I remember hearing about the line-ups a long time ago and I have been here three times.   To be honest, yes, the food is not bad at all but definitely it leaves me wondering that maybe us Torontonians are sadly lacking good brunch places because I would NOT wait 25 minutes for a brunch here.   Yes, this is much better than Cora's, Sunset Grill and any other standard issue greasy spoons, of course Bonjour Brioche does not even compare and it is another completely --and better animal.   And yes, it does have a certain European appeal, but I really don't think is all that to be five stars or four.   Due to the service that is so-so, which from my experience in France, I have to say that they got that down pat. Not rude, just not overly friendly either.   Would I come back, yes. Yes, I would but I do not think it is all, the pastries although better than many places in Toronto are still not as good as I have tasted elsewhere since there are a few better places in town, perhaps not at this price point, but it shows.   Also I would still recommend La Palette as a somewhat more French experience than Bonjour Brioche."}
{"text":"Possibly THE most cramped space to have bunch, but 100% worth it. Everything is beatifully done, I dont' have much more to say other than BRING CASH to avoid the fee @ the ATM and strike up a conversation beside the uncomfortably close table beside you.    Note on the pastries: They look so very lovely but I'm sorry to say they aren't THE best in the city.  They ARE very very good, but they are always just shy of amazing for me.  A darn shame because they are fresh, the entire restaurant smells wonderful and the pans of freshly baked pastries just make my mouth water.  but, to the taste, I'd honestly rather go to a dedicated bakery than get deserts here.  On the croissant- really not that spectacular.  Not enough butter, the flakey factor is low.  It was disappointing because it looks SO good and smells SO fresh.  It's just a personal preference on the recipe I suppose."}
{"text":"My favorite for breakfast, lunch, brunch for nearly a decade. Their daily specials, brunch cocktails, and eggs benny with smoked salmon is the main reason I have been returning for years! Also, the fresh croissants, pastries, baguette, in-house home made salad dressing AND the strawberry or peach jam (depending on the season) is TO DIE FOR. All these things combine just make Bonjour Brioche such a classic in the city! If you're not from the neighbourhood, It's definitely worth the trek to Riverdale. One warning is: the wait time for a table is pretty excruciating if you're starving. Recommendation: go before the brunch rush (10-1030am) or just after (130-2pm onward)."}
{"text":"Cash only but there is an ATM on site... That's a dirty cash grab. The French toast was really good but I probably won't come back because of their need to squeeze an extra couple bucks from me on the ATM thing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Products are fresh. Amazing quiche lorriane just like in France. I was dining with a Parisian friend for brunch and even she thought most (not all) items were like France although not exactly the same bc ingredients differ (French artisans only use pure butter) Their brioche and baguettes are similar but not exactly the same - still close enough :) Their pissaladiere also is not genuine French - it's supposed to be thick bread not thin crust. I didn't like where their patio is situated - wayyy too loud and you get horrible distracting traffic over our conversation. Also keep in mind they don't take reservations and they have a policy not to seat you unless everyone in your party has arrived. I prefer Le Neuf Cafe but if Im in the area I might drop back in here"}
{"text":"This is definitely the closest you can get to Paris without booking a flight! I had the eggs benny with peameal bacon on a croissant, and it was amazing!!!! How can I go back to regular store bought croissants when I have tasted heaven in pastry form???? Light and flaky and a perfect medium for the peameal bacon! I also had an amazing bowl of hot chocolate and took some tarts for home! Can't wait to go back already!"}
{"text":"The service is very slow and the food is well overpriced ($17 for tiny portion of salmon with a side of salad). Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere to eat - they should only operate as a bakery and stop pretending like they know how to run a breakfast place!  After the impression they've made I won't go there to buy a bread even:/"}
{"text":"Got there at 11:45AM on a Sunday and waited in line at the back for about 20 minutes until we were seated. The waitress came by to take our order quickly, I ordered the rare roast beef Sandwich with brie and garlic aioli and my gf got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  Drinks came within 5 minutes but the food took about 25 minutes. The bread on the sandwich was nice and crispy and overall the cheese/roast beef was a great combo. The eggs benedict was cooked just right but the croissant was a bit too sweet.  Total price was $27.10 before tips, which included two soft drinks and the two entrees. Overall I would recommend this place and will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"Sadly, my regular BCo (Brunch Companion) has left Toronto, westbound back to her home city of Vancouver.  I'll miss you and our culinary adventures!!  In her memory (haha), I thought I'd review one of our first brunch stops, and her favourite.    I live on the far west end of the city, so to be willing to go all the way to Leslieville for brunch shows the trust I put in my BCo when she told me that this is her favourite brunch spot in all of Toronto.  Okay, really, who am I kidding - I'm always willing to go out of my way for great food.    I arrived and was a little confused about where I was supposed to enter the restaurant.  Even after finding the door, I thought I might be at the wrong one.  But, my BCo spotted me and waved from her table.  I was very glad that we had decided to continue our tradition of arriving at opening, because by the time we left there was a line out the door (and this was in the middle of winter!).    The main thing I remember is how delicious the French toast was.  I've said in a recent review that I'm usually disappointed when I select a sweet option - this was an exception.  Generous, hearty, delicious.  That's how I would describe the plate that was put in front of me.  I was disappointed that they couldn't (wouldn't?) accommodate my request to have no melon in my accompanying fruit salad.  Melon is an evil fruit that infects its flavour into everything it touches.  I'm not a fan.  Apparently their fruit is pre-mixed so I was out of luck.  But back to the French toast.  It was raisin brioche bread, dipped in French toast batter and fried...then covered in real maple syrup.  It was divine.  It almost made me forgive the melon on my plate...almost.    The café itself was cute, but not a lot of tables for a place that's so popular.  I noticed that you could also bakery items, and was told by my friend that their bread is fantastic.  All in all, delicious French toast, cute atmosphere, okay service, but it should really have a better waiting system and the inability to customize my order slightly bothered me.  What if I was allergic?    Oh, and please note: cash only!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I had a brioche with a rasberry lemon filling and a salmon baguette sandwich. It was really good! The coffee also taste great and was a good price."}
{"text":"Bonjour Brioche is the right way to start any weekend morning.  I had heard about the notorious line-ups at Bonjour Brioche.  Having not eaten anything in preparation for brunch, I was hoping and praying that the wait would not be so long that my stomach would start drumming.  I already have enough \"awkward moment\" stories in my repertoire to recount thank you very much!  Street parking is free, which is a bonus.  We arrived around 11:30AM, and there was a line-up outside the door.  The wait was shorter than I expected, and having experienced hour-long lineups at the Hoof Café, the 15-minute wait at Bonjour Brioche was a blessing.  We happened to walk past Lady Marmalade en route to Bobbette & Belle after brunch, and the line-up was Hoof Café-esque... That's another \"to try\" for me.    We nabbed a seat on their heated patio which was neat as the weather was quite nice on Sunday.  I sat directly underneath the heater, and felt as if someone were holding a torch up to my back. The server did say that if it was too hot she could turn it off, but I'd rather be too warm than too cold so I didn't request it.    I ended up ordering a Mango Mimosa, since I was heading over to the Koffee Krawl UYE after, and my DC ordered a coffee.  The Mimosa was bubbly and refreshing, and it was more champagne than juice, which was generous.  Nothing worse than drinking a 2:1 juice to champagne ratio mimosa... The cup was adorned with a piece of star fruit, which made for great presentation.  The drink itself contained 2 blackberries.  We opted for the Caramelized Fig & Blue Cheese Tart, which came with a serving of their famous baguette, a monstrous slab of butter, and a mixed greens salad.  To satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered the French Toast w/ Maple Syrup and Fruit.    The Blue Cheese Tart was quite creamy.  However, I found the figs had an almost burnt flavour to them.  The tart pastry seemed to have the crispiness of phyllo pastry and the buttery goodness of a pie crust.  I do feel however, that the blue cheese was a little understated in the dish.  The side salad was absolutely delicious!  My DC and I were sitting and trying to figure out for the longest time what vinaigrette was being used and we just could not figure it out!  Upon questioning the server, we were informed that it was made with: rice wine vinegar, basil, canola oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  It is THE best vinaigrette I have ever tasted.  It is also available for sale at the front counter.  Since I was going to be heading to the Koffee Krawl, I didn't want to carry it, but will definitely stop by for a bottle when I'm in the area next time.  The baguette was extra crusty, and is one of the freshest I have tasted in Toronto.  I ended up buying a loaf for my mom because she loves baguettes!  The French Toast w/ Maple Syrup was made with an apple-cinnamon brioche bread, dusted with icing sugar with a slightly caramelized crust.  The flavours were evenly distributed in the bread, and it was bursting with eggy and buttery goodness.  The fruit that came with consisted of: plum, grapefruit, cantaloupe and blueberries.  You must must must order this if you brunch at Bonjour Brioche!  I would highly recommend BB as a brunch spot.  I don't get out to this part of town often, but now I think I have an excuse to!  If you don't like getting dinged with withdrawal fees, then remember to bring cash, as that is the only accepted method of payment.  But if you really do forget, there is an ATM at the bottom of the stairs by the washrooms for your convenience."}
{"text":"if you don't eat in they TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP   I have been going to this place for at least 3 years. When I walk in they are so happy and chipper and say \"HI\".  Once I tell them that i just want a coffee and a tart, then the service seems to go downhill from there. They get this attitude that they can be rude to me because i am not sitting in the restaurant. Its like they don't care for my money. it sucks that you have to eat in a place to get good service. The other day I took my employee there for lunch (take out) and they again greeted my well, but it again went down hill from there. I have in the past I have always paid by cash, that day I wanted to pay by interact. I was told rudely that they only take cash. The cash women didn't even offer to help me locate a bank machine. She just turned away.  So I dug out my money and paid and she RUDELY just tossed the change in my hand. NO THANK YOU FOR THE BUSINESS. I said to her \"Your WELCOME\"   I hate when shop people have an attitude that they think they are better cause you are eating in their place of business."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm butter. The croissants are flaky delights. The pain au chocolat is a delectable treat for added sinful pleasure. And if sweet isn't your thing, try the cheese twist croissant. (Or, buy all three because you need to sample and \"share\".) It's worth the trip from downtown (and walking through Riverdale is always pleasant). You can tell yourself the walk will do you good after eating french pastries."}
{"text":"Food is as amazing as ever, but the good news is that service has finally become bearable!...."}
{"text":"YUM.   Fresh pastries and flaky croissants.  Lunch time here is busy. It's not like you can make a reservation, but come early to grab a table. We came for lunch on a weekday around 12pm and my friend was lucky enough to get a table in the corner.   Lots on the menu on the wall (specials) and in my hand, but I opted for the specials - the Chedder and Smoked Bacon Tart. What's a tart exactly?? Some cross between a quiche and a pot pie. It was really tasty, and hearty. Flakyness (in a good way) exceeded expectations. Came with a tasty salad.   I know this is so bad for me, but I want to come and buy some pastries here one day. Special treat perhaps.   Hopefully one day will be able to try the brunch. There's always a line up out the door."}
{"text":"You'll smell Bonjour Brioche before you ever see this wee cafe in Toronto's Leslieville neighbourhood. I took the Queen streetcar and almost missed the place but knew I wasn't far off when the heady scent of fresh bread hit me.  One look at the specials on the chalk board and I knew what I'd be having: the grilled chicken sandwich on focaccia with guacamole, bacon and Havarti cheese. This sandwich was ridiculously indulgent - the focaccia was not unlike a crispy pillow of heaven sprinkled with kosher salt and the chicken packed a flavor punch. And those responsible for the addition of guacamole and Havarti should be commended on this stellar combination.  Not sure I'd wait in line two hours for brunch at the weekend but I loved my rainy mid-week meal here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Absolutely amazing brunch and their pastries are always fresh and to die for. This is my go to place for croissants. No one makes it better than Bonjour Brioche. Only minor complaint are that I smell like old butter after eating here but I guess they can't control that as they're constantly baking at the back."}
{"text":"I can't give it a 5 since the oven was broken that day. This is a small place so be prepare to wait for a table even for just a party of 2 on a weekday. We ordered a spicy bacon baguette and a French toast. I have to agree with the other reviews. They have the best baguette I've ever had."}
{"text":"A couple of things to note before heading over:  It's cash only.  There's an ATM downstairs but it's for Canadian bank cardholders. You will wait.  The line can get long to get in, keep your party down to 2.  Once you're in and ordered, your food may take a while.  If you have some cash, some time and not afraid to spend a little extra for an incredible breakfast/brunch - this has got to be, hands down, the best place to eat.  In fact, I'd venture to say the closest you'll get to having breakfast in Paris in Toronto.    Fresh squeezed juices such as cucumber-lime and mango-tangerine were just the beginning to a splendid brunch.  We later tried the almond croissant and a chocolate croissant.  Get this, croissants are only CAN  $1.50.  Yes, that's it.  They are large and fluffy, fresh and with a great outside crust.  The best croissant I've ever had.  Our main dishes were the Spicy Bacon Sandwich and Eggs Benedict special.  Both per the recommendation of our server.  Both a taste of heaven.  Each came with a side of salad drizzled with a light vinaigrette complementing both main dishes very well.  The spicy bacon has a mix of sweet and spicy.  The bacon is baked to a crispy perfection, when eaten together with the baguette the perfect crunch is formed.  Not too tough and not too soft, balance is struck.  Eggs Benny was served on a croissant.  Then a choice of meat to which I opted half and half.  One came Peameal (Canadian Bacon) and one smoked salmon.  Each delicately topped with the perfect cooked egg.  You know those that still have a bit of egg yolk run yet you know is cooked?  Yes, that's it.  And topped off with Hollandaise sauce.    For desert - yes, you'll need to stretch for it.  Although the meals look light, they are very filling.  Take your pick from the desert tray, all filled with wonderful looking pastries.  We opted for sour cherry together with coffee.  Again, you just can't go wrong.  Come early, allow some time for waiting and getting your food but you won't leave disappointed or wanting more!"}
{"text":"Bonjour, was it brioche you're looking for?   I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile.   I'm sorry, brioche, that our tale of love was rather short lived. Perhaps it's my fault. Perhaps I set expectations of our relationship too high, with my admiration of the tasteful pictures of your beautiful tarts and formidable reviews. But alas, disappointment followed our last Sunday brunch:   Blue Cheese & Chicken Tart ($9.50)- It was a good tart, just good. I enjoyed the soft yet crisp layers of the shell. Nonetheless, I was just not overwhelmed. Mm...what else can I say. Oh. It came with a side of green salad. And a baguette with a crust that just won't quit. Egg and Steak Sandwich ($12) - Very ordinary and exactly like the name sounds, eggs and steak on a crunchy baguette. Also came with a side salad.  Bonjour Brioche place wasn't bad. It just wasn't the life changing type of brunch that Torontonian reviews set it out to be. The food was medicore. So was the service. So was the decor.   Alas, the search for brunch charming continues for this young lady. Adieu, Brioche."}
{"text":"With out fail I come to this amazing gem of a cafe every time I'm in Toronto. Best food and even better service. It's very cozy so don't be afraid to get close to your neighbors next to you. I recommend the brioche French toast .....amazing the best Ive ever had. I also recommend the croissants and fruit tarts to take home with you as a treat"}
{"text":"Another great french bakery.  The owners are a husband and wife from Lyon, France.   The pastries are just amazing, flaky, light, sweet, rich. They have them all, croissants, turnovers, baguettes.  I went there for lunch and had the roast beef and brie on a baguette.  To die for. C'est à dire, magnifique!"}
{"text":"First time there.  I am amazed how good the brioche are here.  The best that I have had in North America! Now I find that it's not really too hard to find decent coffee in Toronto, but since Pain Perdu closed, it has been hard to find a truly great bakery/restaurant imho.  This is it!   Now I know that I am a very late arrival to the scene here.  Yes they have been open for 20 years.  But I have only been here a year as a resident of Toronto.   I spoke with the baker and am very impressed. The service was good if somewhat cold in attitude.  But I was the first customer of the day so they might of not had all their cylinders firing quite yet. I highly recommend the place.  I know that I shall be back often, especially on weekdays as there seems to be a long line up outside the door on weekends."}
{"text":"I brunch a lot and this is hands down my favorite place.  The food is amazing; I never mind waiting in line."}
{"text":"I am not usually in the Queen East area often but a friend of mine suggested Bonjour Brioche and so I decided to go on an adventure for great food! The cafe is at a corner of the intersection which made it easy to find. We arrived around 11:45 on a Sunday, which is brunch prime time. We waited in lime for about 20-25 minutes and got a nice corner table im their small patio (be warned there is no AC inside). The waiter arrived and took our drink orders right away and mentioned the specials.  I got the Bonjour Benny with smoked salmon. It was very delicious! The salad that came with the dish was well seasoned and very fresh which complimented the eggs benny. It also came with a baguette and a cube of butter.  My friend ordered the Croque Madam which she also enjoyed! She did agree that the eggs benny was better though.  We also decided to get one of their butter tart to end brunch on a sweet note and it was amazing! I would definitely come back to try their other tarts, especially the custard ones."}
{"text":"Yes you have to wait in line and yes they only take cash, but it's all worth it! Oh the buttery baguette, the latte bowl, smoked salmon with scrabbled eggs, $5 pomegranate mimosa... need I say more? Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"First of all, we waited for an hour in the cold, which is fine, cos we assumed this place is popular. What's not fine, however, was that four couples bypassed us (there were three of us), and we ended up sitting at a two-person table. Two of us had to basically squeeze into a one person spot. The seating was extremely disorganized, which probably explained why the wait was so long. Customer service was poor, no one apologized for the wait, nor for shoving us into a tiny spot.   Food came half an hour after we were seated.  We ordered the savory french toast and croissant Benny with peameal bacon (their specials). Overall quality of food was average, definitely not worth the long wait in the cold. The side salad was good though. We also ordered two croissants cos we were starving, the plates that the croissants were served on were hot, so we thought we were getting warm fluffy croissants. However the croissants were cold and hard, guess they've been sitting in their bakery for a while..   Overall, poor experience with this place, food was really average, I paid 22$, which was pricy given the quality of food and service.   (If you are getting your food packed, make sure you triple check to ensure that you are actually bringing your own food home. I went home, expecting to find my Benny in the bag, and found a half eaten chocolate cake instead. Gross!)"}
{"text":"We had brunch there on a Sunday morning.  Portions are huge! French toast was delicious as was the eggs benny.     Wait staff are fast and friendly.    I would recommend this place to anybody who likes brunch!  Just get there early.  Line up happens fast and continued until early afternoon when we drove by later in the day!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow, inattentive service. The owner was extremely rude. The food was average at best."}
{"text":"This French brunch spot and bakery is always packed! I've been a couple times and left quite satisfied. The fresh breads and pastries are unbelievably delicious. The eggs Benedict was great but nothing like their pastries and breads. Basically, I'd suggest sticking to anything with bread and pastries :)   I would suggest you arrive before 10am to avoid the rush. Otherwise you are sure to need to wait. On a summer day, the patio is a great place to be in the morning!   Coffee is as you would expect of a French cafe, quite strong, bold, and great. They keep filling your cup too which is always great.   Service is great and they are always helpful in making suggestions and providing details about the daily specials."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch one Saturday.  There was a long ass line.  The place is really cramp.  You can't hardly move.  One fart and the person sitting next to you will know it.   There is outdoor seating, but are you going to sit outside when it is 50 below zero?  The french baguette was okay.  You get better bread in Paris.  But, Toronto is not Paris, so what am I complaining about?  Anyway, if there is no wait, I would say the place is okay.  Eat there.  But if there is a long wait, I rather go to the cafe up the block."}
{"text":"Aw man I can't believe someone beat me to it. Oh well...can't be the first to review everything.  This place is simply amazing...it is a bit out of the way from the city center of Toronto, but well worth the trip. I had one of the best French Toast ever! I still think about it 3 years later...ok I am a loser, but still this place rocks!n My wife had the best baguettes and jam she has tried, outside of NY and France. We then grabbed a few pastries for the hotel room, and they were all amazing. We filled our bellies all night with their treats."}
{"text":"Decent place with a lot of hype. The wait wasn't bad. Had the special, smoked salmon, poached egg on brioche. Tried the chocolate croissant and a latte. Nothing spectacular. Your usual brunch fare with the addition of crowds. I'm not sold yet."}
{"text":"I was very exited about this place after reading all the amazing reviews.  I drove from st Clair and yonge to thins place because I thought it was gonna be a great experience. It was not.  Let me star you with: no AC, inside or out, nothing, it's the end of summer the day I went it was 30 degrees, well, it's not fun to eat and sweat at the same time.  We sat in the patio, it was actually hotter inside than out.  If you are tall it's gonna be very uncomfortable eating cuz the tables are super short and you are sitting in wood.   There's spider webs in several places which it makes me think they don't clean.  Ok so I went there for the food right? Well don't bother, most of the \"specials\" were sold out and the food was plain, even the coffee tasted very diluted. The only item that we enjoyed were the tarts (sweet tarts) but that was it, never coming back."}
{"text":"Four co-coworkers decided to visit my area for breakfast on my day off.  I recommended that we go to Bonjour Brioche, because I like the food.  Lady Marmalade is more consistent that Bonjour Brioche, but the lines there are just too long.  The food is the only reason that this review isn't 1 star.  The service was again horrible.  We had to sit outside in very cold weather.  That hasn't impacted the star rating.  There were five of us, which is perhaps difficult to handle in a smaller place.  I also discovered that Eggs Benedict is not available during the week - only weekends.  That's too bad.   I ended up going with the Croque Madame.  It was delicious.  The croissant that I ordered was also delicious.   Two members of my group do not eat pork, and were challenged to find something to order.  One of them got a salmon rosti dish.  It was quite small on the plate, with no salad included as there is with other dishes.  At the end of the meal he said that he was still hungry.  What really ruined the experience for me was the surly service.  The server was uninterested and at times rude.  Given that I recommended this place, I was personally embarrassed.  The members of my group commented that they probably won't come back.  After a few experiences like this, I'm not sure if I will, either.  Bonjour Brioche - Good food, with more selection on weekends,  difficult to get a table for more than 2 people, and consistently bad service.  Also, cash only."}
{"text":"Just saw this place on the Hulu series Handmaid's Tale (author is Canadian Margaret Atwood) .... I'll be stopping by this summer!"}
{"text":"I was just told about this place today. I got the Rare Roast Beef with Melted Brie, Garlic Aioli on a baguette...it was absolutely delicious!!! Can't wait to come back and try out other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for a takeaway snack and a second time today for brunch. Both times the food has been excellent, but both times there's been a huge wait between ordering and receiving food. The first time, I was grabbing a quick, ready-made thing, so it was really strange that it took so long, on a quiet day with only one table, to get it. The staff person seemed sort-of spacey & rude.   Today, between ordering food & receiving it was at least 30 min. It was pretty busy, so I get that they may have been slammed, it just seemed like a long time.   The wait was okay, and the food was well worth the wait - totally delicious eggs benny, spicy bacon sandwich, and egg sandwich, with frequent refills of both water and coffee.   I'm giving an otherwise superlative experience 4 stars because they were really rushing us to get out - within ten minutes of receiving our food, anyone who wasn't actively eating was asked if they could clear our plates. The bill arrived at our table without anyone asking if we wanted anything else, and before everyone was finished eating. It was weird and abrupt, but especially annoying because we'd waited so long for the food. To wait so long & then get rushed to finish sucked.   I don't know if that's a usual thing, or if it was an anomaly, but both of my experiences here have been a bit odd.   I'll totally go back - the food is great! But I hope next time it's less weird."}
{"text":"I had the croque madam. While the main part of this dish was good, I really liked the side salad. So many times you know at breakfast you get lots of potatoes and grease, not this. The salad was light, plentiful and delish! The croque madam, I thought it was good too. I'm glad they didn't mess up mine made over easy runny with another at my table that wanted not runny. Luckily it dripped very nice, over the ham and was a perfect blend in my mouth.  The service was really cool, I really like them. The guy in the ball cap kept track of everyone in line when we were waiting outside. And he sent glaring evil eyes to the table that was holding us up from eating.  The one thing I felt though I was done eating really fast. If they sent the food out faster, people would be in and out a lot faster.  Tons of people come here for the bread, it must be really good. As we wait, one in one out with  a baguette. Perhaps I shall be Parisian and go get a baguette."}
{"text":"To me, the popular neighourhood brunch spot Bonjour Brioche is overrated. On every weekend, rain or shine, there's ALWAYS a bloody long lineup, for crying out loud! Sometimes you can barely squeeze through the sidewalk and be on your way because the lineup is thick. Ugh!  So one sunny free weekday, I did what any curious sucker would do: eat here for once and find out for myself. No lineups, for once. Phew!  I had a peameal bacon sandwich, and it was a mouthful of fresh flavours on a tasty bun. But it didn't quite blow my mind. It's not something I would line up nearly an hour for.  What really had me on a sour note was the service. Walked in and found an empty small table at the patio bench. Already I felt lonely. And it took maybe 10 minutes (at the verge of me walking out on an anticlimactic note), before a staff noticed that someone new had just conjured up and should be offered a drink and a menu.  Whereas other parties in the patio were being attended to regularly, including two Japanese girls that sat beside me before I was even given a menu, I was largely ignored, even when I called for a server. I don't know; was it because I was dining alone? It took them 10 minutes to produce the bill, which I promptly took to the front to pay. Was going to bring it up with a manager, but I was running late.  Comme ci, comme ça, I guess. Not a place I would be ecstatic to line up to eat again at.  {TTC: any Queen streetcar to Saulter St/Boulton Ave.}"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars  Today was my first day having brunch here.  We decided to go with the daily special, poached egg, with smoked salmon or peameal bacon and hollandaise sauce.  (that's right eggs benny, without being called eggs benny).  I had the smoked salmon, and my bf ordered the peameal bacon.  It was delish - there were lots of different flavours so its was hard to tell what was going one.  Pros:  the eggs benny came on a fresh butter croisant, and not an english muffin.  Also came with some pickled celery and caramelized onions, which sweetened the dish.  The salad with their house dressing was amazing.    Cons:  The hollandaise sauce was thinner than most places and a little bit more lemony, the side of baguette with butter (a super huge pat of butter) was a bit of overkill.  I couldn't help myslef and ordered their savoury tart du jour (fig caramelized onion, and blue cheese).  It tasted like a small quiche.  It was ok, I would try a different flavour maybe next time, or maybe I was just full.  I ordered the pecan tart to go.  This had a nice consistency, not to runny, and caramelized butter tart filling, yum.  Overall 3.5 stars b/c they did some things really well, and other things not so much.  BTW we got a seat inside and it was boiling like a sauna, and it was so loud it was hard to have decent conversation.  It was also pricey, with tax and tip it came to over $50."}
{"text":"Bonjour Brioche is one of my favorite brunch places in Toronto.  It is a small, french cafe in Leslieville - they serve tarts, croissants, mimosas.  Their food is a little bit lighter than your typical breakfast fare (greasy eggs and bacon).  They also do take out for their baked goods - which is great if you are having a lazy Sunday and don't want to cook.  I would recommend their tarts and pain au chocolate, so delicious!! The only slight negative is how crowded they are on weekends during brunch hours - it is a small space and they have put as many tables in the space as possible so you are a bit squished.  Trying to get a table for more than four would be a big challenge."}
{"text":"Walked towards the restaurant and saw a line coming out of the restaurant. It was about a 10-15 minute wait for us, so it wasn't too bad. Once we got seated, I found that they covered the tables with a used cloth and there were still baguette and eggs on the table. It was definitely not as sanitary as I thought. We then ordered right away and got fresh juices : cucumber and lime juice and the passion fruit mint lemonade. The juices were definitely refreshing but there was a lot of sugar in it.   The waiter was super friendly and tried to keep talking to us to make sure we are okay. After almost half an hour, the people beside us got their food first, when we were the first ones to order. I thought that was not so clever of them because we also got the same food. Nicely, the waiter came up to us and apologized and told us our food is coming. We finally got our food about five minutes later.   We ordered the Croque Madame and the Eggs Bennie with salmon. The side salad was amazing!! I thought it was the brightest idea anyone has thought of! Such healthy choices with eggs and toast. A little disappointed with the quality as the eggs were not made to par and they were undercooked and underseasoned. I had egg white all over my toast and the hollandaise on the Bennie was little to none.   Overall, it was a decent place to go if you want good homemade cocktails, but the food was definitely not as impressive as I thought."}
{"text":"there has got to be something right about a restaurant that makes one patron order the same thing that brings turmoil to his stomach and digestive system each time he goes back.    BUT ITS SO TASTY.  next time you see me at Bonjour, if I have a tasty meatloaf sandwich smothered with dijon and carmelized onions on a french baguette, remind me of this review and try to wrestle it away from me.  If its nice, sit on their dainty patio as the inside can be pretty tight both by its setup and when its packed, which is kind tantamount to saying, when its open.  ive also had bowls of latte, salad specials, and soups and never have I had a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Living on the east side, I've had brunch here about 5 times. Good food, decent service. So, why two stars? The place is dirty - actually,  it's filthy. Come for the French toast, stay for the caked on foreign food particles on coffee mugs/plates/cutlery, and tablecloths covered in crumbs. It's disgusting!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to have a meal at Bonjour Brioche for many many months and finally had the opportunity this past weekend after participating in the 50km ride for heart charity bike ride. After waiting 20+ minutes in line to get seated (normal for a well hyped brunch spot in leslieville on a weekend afternoon), we immediately ordered drinks and an appetizer so we can munch on something as we decide. Very shortly after we received two iced lattes with Bailey's and a butter croissant with jam. Delicious. Once they brought these, we ordered two specials. One was a bonjour benny with salmon and the other was a brioche.   This is where the experience gets very sour. We had to wait 1hr17m to get our COLD meals. In this time, parties to the left and right of us had been seated, fed, and checked out twice over. But not us. We repeatedly had asked our waiter on the status and he assured us the kitchen was busy and it's coming.   It safe to say that I will not be going back to my local breakfast spot and I will preach the terrible service they have."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of this place for the longest amount of time, even saying this is where I would go on a day off!  So last week, on a day off, I came here for breakfast. Not a weekend because this restaurant has lineups over 45 min of wait time!   I arrived before 11am and sat down for the baked French toast I have been dreaming of. The dish arrived with 2 small toast deeply covered in powdered sugar, maple syrup on the side, and a generous portion of berries, grapes, 1 watermelon piece and cantaloupe melon. The cantaloupe was not ripe by the way.  I admit, I was discombobulated by the actual French toast. Unlike cheaper diners, or even other restaurants that serve brunch on the weekends, these were smaller portions. And unlike those other servings, this left me satiated without the bloat. In the end, I reconciled the image in my mind with what was actually served.  I headed to the cashier to settle my bill. I don't understand why they don't accept cash. Allegedly, they have \"many transactions under $4\". Somehow, I have a very difficult time accepting that argument because at the very least, in one sitting during the entire day, they can collect up to $180 (they have 12 tables of 2 and using an average of $15 bill). In one sitting. There are many, many more sittings and on an average month of 26 days (they don't open on Mondays), you can do the month of how much they can earn. What is missing from my equation is the understanding of their fixed costs and variable costs, and the negotiations that occur with trusted suppliers. I wish I could have had a conversation with the manager to understand better why they don't use a POS terminal.  Before the clock over the cashier marked 11am, there was already a line up!  What an incredible racket, I mean, operation they run!"}

{"text":"I stopped in today for a highly recommended brunch with a friend of mine, who lives in the neighbourhood and said I would \"just LOVE the place\".  Mid-day on a Friday we waited about 10 minutes for a table, not that I minded very much.  Once seated we got our waters fairly quickly, our waiter was pleasant, all is well.  I personally found their menu rather limited. Perhaps they switch it out for a more extensive one on the weekend? My friend ordered the beef sandwich, and I the smoked salmon/scrambled eggs with caviar.  His sandwich looked very lonesome on his plate. No garnish or salad. I'm pretty sure they forgot, as I've seen photos of the same sandwich with the salad along side it. He brought it up, but wasn't too bothered.  I received a rather small portion of smoked salmon and caviar with my eggs, I don't know why I was expecting the portion size to be generous, as the price-point is on the reasonable to inexpensive side.  The eggs were alright, but nothing short of what I could of made at home. Same goes with the bread. And the potato portion of my dish, which were shredded and possibly fried? ended up tasting soggy as opposed to crunchy, which was somewhat disappointing.  The only thing really saving this review would be the lemon tart I ordered to go which was absolutely fabulous. Just the right about of sweet to sharp flavour. and the crust was an ideal thickness. Enough to hold its own taste without being obnoxious.  Would I go back? Maaaybe. But the best brunch in the city? Definitely not."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I took a nice stroll from Riverdale over to Brioche in the heart of winter just to try out this place. When we arrived there was a bit of a long wait, about 45 minutes but let me tell you, it was worth the wait!   I ordered the poached egg- special of the day, with salmon on a croissant. It came with mixed greens and a side of baguette. My fiancé had the scrambled egg with with salmon that was quite tasty as well. Definitely gotta try to chai latte bowl, so yummy. And we topped off the meal with the  raspberry tart that was served with a side of homemade whipped cream. Everything was do delicious. They have so many choices of tarts, cookies and cakes. Everything totalled up to about $45 which we thought was such a good deal. We will definitely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"From a service standpoint I won't comment as I think it is adequate for what they do. I mean, this isn't exactly a 5 star dining experience. Yes, it's somewhat slow. No, the waiters are not exactly super attentive and cheery. The constant lineup out the door with hungry, angry people gawking certainly doesn't help with the service struggles either.  Aside from that, the food is great. The baguette is exceptional, croissants are moist, fluffy and buttery. The food is on the slightly lighter tasting side but tastes fresh and delicious nonetheless. To those who crave big slabs of greasy bacon slathered in sriracha, five spice and curry 9am in the morning.....this is not your joint. The flavours and subtle, clean and fresh.  Go ahead and sit on the patio, it will make the somewhat slow service somewhat bearable."}
{"text":"Great spot! I had the smoked salmon benny special with greens.   The croissant and brioche are delicious too.   FYI - bring cash - they don't mention there is no debit or credit until you sit down and check the menu.  Definitely a great brunch spot A+"}
{"text":"Sadly the best days of this venerable east side pioneer are behind it. Uncomfortable  layout and discourteous staff can be forgiven for great food, but the kitchen is not sending out great meals. Will not line up for this anymore."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   Let's start with the process of getting seated: 1 hour wait in the cold, watching 4 couples bypass us (we're a group of 3), only to be told we need to be seated at a table for 2, so you better get cozy and squeeze a bit. So.....why did we need to watch 4 groups of 2 bypass us?  Next, the waiter: unapologetic, no effort to make the prolonged wait and less than ideal seating arrangement any easier to swallow, and checked in with us only 3 times (taking our order, bringing our order, and getting us the bill).  All of this only raised our expectation for the food that much higher to make all of this worth it; and the food was...meh.  I had the savoury French toast, which was ok. The overall experience was less than favourable. If you plan to go, go as a group of 2, that way, you don't have to watch other people bypass you and actually have a table big enough to hold all the dishes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The croissant that everyone is raving about was good but I was not amazed like everyone else was.  Perhaps the bar was set too high?  It was SO slow.  From the time we sat it took an hour for our food to get to us.  Fifteen minutes of that was waiting to take our order.  It was a Saturday brunch but from the looks of it most tables had already been served so I can't think of a reason why the kitchen would be so backed up.  Which led me to believe that the kitchen must be so small that they must be getting slammed in there.  So I went to the washroom to peer inside out of curiosity.  I was wrong.  The kitchen was actually quite big and not much was going on in there.  On top of that there is a separate bakery in the basement.  So my idea of kitchen space being a problem was incorrect.  When we finally did get our food my girlfriend's order was taken wrong.  She specifically asked for her eggs to be poached hard because she does not like yoke.  And the hollandaise was lacking in seasoning yet was sweet.  Over all a bad experience."}
{"text":"While I have never come here for a sit-down meal, I do come in once or twice a week for a coffee or a croissant. The latter is why I give this place five stars. Having been noted by popular Torontonian media as \"The Best Croissant in the City\", it was necessary that I try this place out. It does not disappoint. Both the cheese and plain croissant are buttery and incredible, and I consider it a treat to be able to grab one of these puppies for breakfast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"PROS: - lovely, lovely pastries and croissants. grab a croissant and meander down Queen Street to the Dark Horse to get a coffee on a nice summer day. perfect! - the wait isn't ever too long. that being said, there is ALWAYS a wait...it's just not that bad of a wait - patio! - decent prices. $8.75 for the croque madam, the tart du jour and the quiche du jour (which all come with a salad and baguette w/ butter).  - light, refreshing meals. i don't ever feel heavy after a meal at bonjour brioche. especially good for hot summer days when you just want to have something light but still filling - there are always three tart du jour choices and three quiche du jour choices. lots of variety to choose from! - always really friendly and helpful service. always.  CONS:  - the space is small, which means it's squishy in there. be ready to bump elbows with the people next to you - because there is always a wait and the space is so squishy, i feel compelled to eat quickly and get out fast. i know this doesn't have to be the case and that i can take my time, but that's how it feels to be in there  FAVOURITE ORDER: the croque madam! packed full of flavour (the ham and the gruyere make that happen). it's brioche that the sandwich is made on, which is so buttery and heavenly.   (if you are looking for something lighter though, i would choose one of the tarts du jour!)"}
{"text":"Long story short.  Bunch of rude, heartless, and ignorant assholes run this place with no compassion for people especially people they feel do not belong or are suitable for their shitty establishment.   My mother endured an extremely humiliating situation at Bonjour Brioche. She went in on a Saturday to wait for 45 mins with her cane, with nowhere to sit while she waited for her friend. A number of people who were waiting after her were seated before her, and she asked when she would get a seat until her friend arrived. She'd like to have a coffee while she waited.   Basically was told, your friend's not here; tough shit no seat you can wait. She asked well what if my guest cancelled last minute and I would like to eat alone. Are you not going to serve me even if I sit and have something alone?  they then started to tell her that they get that excuse all the time and that she could not get a table until her friend arrived.   As she asked for the manager, her friend arrived at the same time. She explained to the manager that she's been waiting with her cane, hasn't been given a table and that people after her had been seated even if they were waiting for others. She felt demeaned and didn't appreciate the service and that she would be taking business somewhere else. Instead of the manager making some arrangement to ease the situation she told my mother that she can leave now.   I have never in my life had my mother call me and cry on the phone of how humiliated and embarrassed she felt.   Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"After all the hype I was expecting MUCH better. The breakfast selection is limited. I had the Croque Madam and was very dissapointed. The only good thing was being able to specify the egg over easy rather than sunny side up. The ham tasted (or didnt) like something from a Schneider's plastic pack and the cheese must have come from a no name processed slice. The combination was tasteless and the plate overflowing with greens at 0830 in the morning? Seriously????. The Coffee American was blah & weak and adding milk killed the taste totally. The baguette was crusty all right although I couldnt shake the feeling it was slightly stale.   Then to crown it all the menu proudly proclaimed that it did not accept credit or debit cards. Really? For these prices? Yet the place filled up. This why Montrealer's think Torontonians dont know squat about good food. This place would be out of business in Montreal in less than a year and no thats not where I am from but did live there for 10 years. Heck Chez Cora serves better food and they are a chain."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch spot in the city as it reminds me of the European patisseries I frequented while living abroad. The pastry selection is seriously dangerous in the best possible way: croissants, cookies, tarts, baguettes, breads, spreads, you name it. And I dream about the spicy bacon and avocado sandwich. Even the side salad with the basil vinaigrette is delish!  They always have a dozen daily specials (highly recommended) and some interesting fresh juices.   You can always expect a bit of a wait, but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"4/5 stars. Why? I love Paris and this brings back the memories. Been here several times and keep coming back.  Priced are standard ($10-15), if not a bit cheaper than other premium brunch places, and the atmosphere is the best. It's very tight (or cozy) inside, but the food and ambience makes up for it. There's usually a line after 10am on weekends.  Food is great and it's hard to go wrong with any of the items."}
{"text":"Great Odin's Raven! Their eggs benedict is the best I have ever had! They bake the croissants at the restaurant - which the benny is served on with fresh ingredients and every bite of it was heavenly. Their croissants, on its own, chocolate or almond, are amazing and they always manage to sell out when I go on the weekend. Bah humbug."}
{"text":"Came her for brunch today and only had to wait 15 minutes for our party of 3 to be seated (for a Sunday morning around 11am, that was amazing!). We got a cozy corner on their patio. The smell of fresh bread is apparent and this place had amazing baked good! Their croissants (plain and almond) and baguettes are fresh, flaky and full of flavor. They also had tarts and cakes that looked amazing as well. Their service, yes it's a bit slow but sitting on an outdoor patio made time fly. Their coffee could have been a bit stronger being a French restaurant and all but their prices were reasonable ($54 for 3 people which included coffee, entrees and 2 croissants). I ordered their savory french toast - a bit too savory for my liking. The peppers and bacon were incorporated in the bread when I thought it would be on the side. I would recommend ordering the eggs benedict instead. It came on a croissant with greens. Please also note that they only accept cash but they have an ATM downstairs."}
{"text":"*4.5 STARS  If only there was more space here, or have a better way to handle line-ups, I would give this restaurant a full 5 stars.  My friends and I were planning to head to Lady Marmalade for brunch on Sunday, however, with the extensive line-up, we decided to come to Bonjour Brioche (found it on the yelp app).    The line-up seemed shorter, however, unfortunately, I was waiting for another 45 minutes just to get a seat for 4.  I was getting hungry and cranky.  Joanne being hungry and cranky is not a fun sight.  We finally got seated, and I absolutely loved our waiter.  Fun, smart, and had an amazingly great memory.  I had ordered the special that day: poached eggs, smoked salmon, caramelized onions, on a croissant.  Goodness gracious, this was probably the best benny that I had (next to Vancouver's Teahouse).  The caramelized onions was a great touch.  The fresh pear/ginger juice was okay as well, but I could have passed.  My friends had ordered the croque monsieur, and the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs.  They said that my poached eggs was a lot better (which I have to agree with).  For dessert, my girlfriends and I had ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  It was a bit too dense for my liking (and I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate-related pastries... Please don't kill me).  I would love to try the apple tarte tatin next time.  Too bad I was pregnant with a food baby at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Still searching for the best brunch in Toronto...and Bonjour Brioche has been the best thus far!  (I'm reserving my 5 stars for when I blown away!!!).  The spot is really cute -- we had a lovely seat on the side patio, which was quaint and perfect for a Sunday morning. The smells that are coming out of the bakery are just divine....and everything that is being served by the wait staff looks amazing!  The quiche was excellent!! Served with a cute bed of yummy greens, I have to say that the quiche was one of the best we've had in a while!  My partner-in-crime had eggs benny, which came out lovely as well.  The fresh veg/fruit juices complemented the breakfast perfectly, as did the hot cup of fresh coffee.  We couldn't resist having one of the sumptuous desserts after seeing them in the bakery window -- the lemon tart was very yummy and tasted exactly like you'd imagine buying one from a small little patisserie in France. MMMM.  YAY for Bonjour Brioche.  Still on the search for the best brunch in TO, but you're a memorable meal as the search continues....."}
{"text":"Now, this is what I was expecting for Brunch when I moved to the East end! After a sub-par experience with the food and service at Lady Marmalade down the street, my girlfriend and I were eager to find a brunch place in the neighbourhood. Thankfully, we found this place!  Other reviews are right, it'll be a wait to get a table, and the place is busy as busy can be. That being said, we've never had anything but fantastic service, and amazing food!   Whether it's a croissant and coffee on your way to work during the week or a full sit down brunch on the weekend, the food here is astounding! Personally, my favourite is the Smoked Salmon and scrambled eggs, but the Baked French Toast is great and the Croque Madam looks amazing!  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for brunch with french flare, and is willing to wait a little and be in a busy place. If you're looking for no wait and lots of space, Joy Bistro down the street never seems that crazy, busy...but I'm sure there's a reason! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the French style patio & selection for food!  Daily specials & drinks for $5.  Perfect place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic brunch spot and bakery.  We love the brunch although seating can be a challenge if you are not here early enough. There is a small patio for summertime (good weather use).  We often stop just to buy baked goods. The mixed berry Clafouti is absolutely outstanding and the perfect accompaniment to my boeuf bourguignon.  Along with their homemade baguette (also outstanding).  You can't go wrong.  The quiche here is always wonderful -- no matter what flavor and I love the homemade oil and vinegar dressing they use on their greens.  The large latte is generous and goes down well with something sweet (a brioche perhaps), after your breakfast-type meal!"}
{"text":"Went as a group of three at 1 pm on a Sunday.  6 people were seated before us because they were in pairs which was absolutely ridiculous. We waited over an hour to be seated, and there were people who came after us who finished their meals before we were seated.  I had the Quiche Lorraine which was really delicious.  It came with a side of mixed greens.  But we still waited 15 mins for food, and considering it was all prepared foods, it should have been a lot faster.  I thought the portions were reasonable but my friends felt they were a bit small.  For dessert, we ended up sharing a brioche (really meh, flavourless and unfilled), chocolate croissant (not enough chocolate) and raspberry almost tart (pretty delicious, not too sweet). Service was friendly but really disorganized in terms of getting people seated and getting food and drinks out.    I would not dine in again because of how unfair their setup is for seating service.  But I might take out from their bakery."}
{"text":"A good sandwich, but not in respect to the wait time. All of my \"trendy\" or \"hipster\" friends seems to rant and rave about this place, so I decided to give it a shot. The first thought when I walked up was that I was glad I finished work early because I will be standing in line all day. While it wasn't all day, 45 minutes is quite ridiculous for a sandwich at lunch. Maybe I am not with the times and it is actually trendy to waste your whole lunch hour standing a waiting, but I just don't get it. Because of the rave reviews I have heard about this place I decided to suck it up and wait patiently.  When I finally got to the point where I could order a sandwich I had to actually take half a step back just to take in how rude the server was. I thought that maybe it had something to do with my attire (which is not exactly business-like) which would have been semi-acceptable, but then I paid attention to how she was with others and it was just as bad. I wasn't relieved at all, but I was thinking of how great this sandwich must be if they can treat people that way and still have a lineup around the corner ALA Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. When I got to the point that I could order, I went with the Rare roast beef sandwich with brie and garlic aioli on a baguette.  Being in Leslieville, the price was actually pretty surprising. There are very few places that have lunch for under $10, which I personally deem to be top dollar amount for a weekday work lunch. When you factor in wait time of course that jumps way above that price point, but it is still a rare occurrence. I got the sandwich and it was full of flavour. The roast beef was fresh, the brie was thick and smooth, the garlic aioli was a little bit stronger in the garlic that expected but it complimented the rest of the sandwich nicely. The sandwich was a very good sandwich for $6.75 in that area, but I don't think it really lived up to expectations. With all the great reviews on Yelp (that I was quickly going through while waiting in line) and all the hype that it was given by people I know, I think it got a little over-hyped and I was expecting the best sandwich I had ever had. Very good, but not the best by far.  With the food being as good as it was, it troubles me that everything else about the place is really poor. I don't know if it is just them being really cocky because they know they have a consistent lineup or if I should be making some sort of judgement about the French people. Before you jump with the racist card, my other recent French experience is detailed in my review of C'est What?; also a French restaurant with bad customer service. Even though the sandwich is really good and well priced, I don't know if I would return because of that. Not to mention it is very rare that I have that kind of time to kill in the middle of the day. It really does suck that they are so bad when they make a sandwich that is so good. Shame."}
{"text":"Be prepare to wait in the line. Be prepare to wait outside in the cold. Be prepare to see crazy people eating in the so called \"heated\" patio in a freezing cold winter day. Be prepare to share one tiny table even if you're 3 people. Be prepare to elbow the neighbour and let them elbow you. But most of all, be prepare to eat the BEST quiche ever!"}
{"text":"On Sundays Bonjour Brioche is packed. The food was good and the amount of the food was okay. I would have preferred that the food were a bit bigger. The food was of good quality and was fresh. The restaurant itself is also a French bakery with many freshly baked goods. The decor inside also has its charm which creates a good ambiance. The price on their menu was reasonable, however the food took a very long time to arrive. The waitress came by many times to refill our coffees, which was appreciated.  I would have given their breakfast brunch 4 stars but I have to take a star off for their cash only policy. We arrived at the restaurant without enough cash so one of us had to run to a bank to withdraw cash. We don't need a workout before breakfast is served!"}
{"text":"What a cute spot. Stopped here this morning for a quick little breakfast, and have to say it was a lovely experience. I'd describe this place as a cross between a diner and a French bakery. I had an egg omelette and a freshly baked (was there around 8:30am) chocolate croissant which was warm, moist, and delightful. The service is excellent and the food is delicious, but the tables and layout are a bit cramped, the bathrooms are small, and they don't take card payments (but they direct you to the ATM downstairs).    Overall great experience and would come again, but would suggest accepting some form of card payment and a change in music (some jazz, perhaps?)."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Bonjour Brioche! After living in Toronto for almost a decade and hearing about this place every time the word \"brunch\" is mentioned, this visit was long overdue. I'm happy to say it lived up to the hype! First, the croissants are delicious. Not the greatest I've ever had, but one of the best I've had in Toronto. My quiche Lorraine was flavourful and creamy, and came with a generous portion of salad greens (note - not salad, salad greens). The quiche also came with a nice crusty baguette. I took a bunch of pastries to go as well: plain croissants are buttery and crisp on the outside and almost-chewy-enough on the inside, chocolate croissants are kind of a joke - they basically have one chocolate chip's worth of chocolate, and the brioche with raspberry and lemon curd was excellent. Service was great. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly while we waited to be seated and they kept us updated on when we could expect to sit. Our server was attentive and we received our food fairly quickly. Yummy all around but my quiche Lorraine was a bit too soft.  Great desserts!"}
{"text":"THEY ONLY TAKE CASH!  What a fantastic little place.   The good: 1) great daily special- a chicken crepe with brie and apple slices. A good-sized portion that was really tasty  2) awesome atmosphere- we were able to sit on a little patio that was comfortable and pleasant. The patio is quiet enough that, despite being just off Queen E and relatively close to the train tracks, we were able to chat, which I wasn't sure we'd be able to do when we first sat down. 3) friendly staff- the people helping us were attentive and happy to help  Meh: 1) the service- was a bit slow. It took us a good 45min to get our lunch (which was really tasty, though... see above!) 2) they only take cash- and they don't tell you anywhere. They do have an ATM in the basement but one has to wonder how much money they make off the 'cash-only' policy given that there isn't any warning... kind of like selling someone a coffee and then telling them that the cup is extra.  All-in-all... I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Regardless of the packed space, the poor set-up/line-up during winter and the sometimes pushy staff, Bonjour Brioche is undeniably the stalwart of the Leslieville brunch scene.  If you love a good bistro brunch/lunch, this is THE place in Toronto to go.   The tarts du jour range from figs with gorgonzola, to anything sweet and enticing. The omlettes are always fluffy in a way that Julia Child would approve and their croque monsieurs knows no rivals. Traditionalists will love it for the lightly dressed salad and proper cafe au lait bowls, and everyone else will love it for the intimate space, fresh ingredients and consistent quality.   Whenever my girlfriends and I go for brunch we wait for the moment that we set down our forks, about 80% through our meal, and as if telepathically-inclined, a beautiful server will walk by with a big plate of dessert tarts and a twinkle in her eyes, offering us the most delectable chocolate tart, which always gets packed up, smooshed from transit and devoured at home. Bonjour Brioche to me is a magical experience that gets better every time."}
{"text":"Long line ups for Sunday brunch - but so worth it!  The baked French Toast is amazing!! Very big portion though!  The butter tart was definitely the best butter tart I've ever had.  Note: it is a very small cafe, not good for large groups."}
{"text":"went today to get a couple of pastries, they increased their prices from $4 to $5!! upsetting, but I have to be understanding due to inflation. ): they'll just have to be an even more infrequent treat... the gentleman in line before me was upset because his bill was over $100 (he only brought $100), but they waived the $8 or so extra since the person he was picking up the food for was a regular. that was nice of them. they do have an ATM downstairs if needed, so that's convenient."}
{"text":"After not being greeted right away and having to wait in the back of the restaurant for a table, I was not optimistic about our sunday brunch. The waiter offered to seat us on the heated patio and I was quite confused since it was the dead of winter. I was pleasantly surprised when we sat down however as it was warm enough for just a t-shirt!   Food was amazing. I had a roasted veggie omelet with a greens salad and baguette. Definitely will visit again.. and don't be afraid to sit in the heated patio!"}
{"text":"Hard to get seats here. It's a cute and quaint place but honestly, after coming twice, I don't find that the menu draws me back in. If I lived closer to that area, I might go (earlier in the morning) or go take out from their pastry section. The desserts look good and I like that there's a person who comes around with a slice of all their sweets to entice you .   It's definitely a touristy type of restaurant that is cool for a Parisian-Canadian experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch in the spring.  Based on the reviews, I had been expecting tremendously long line-ups, but I think the timing when we arrived was simply perfect.  We managed to arrive and get seated (for a table for 2) immediately. We were given an inside seat by the window. The seating arrangements were a little tight, understandably so though given the size of the place.   Food: I had the Poached Eggs With Smoked Salmon And Hollandaise; while she had the Baked French Toast.  I found my meal to be very delicious and filling. I'm not the CRAZIEST fan of Hollandaise sauce, but it went very well with the poached eggs and the salmon. My friend is allergic to melon - and unfortunately is mixed into the fruit salad that accompanies the Baked French Toast. I tried the Baked French Toast as well, and wouldn't hesitate to order that if I were to return.  Service: Service was a little sub-par. Besides being seated almost immediately, because of our seating location, it was not easy to get the waiter's attention (hard to believe if you were to see how big the place was). We went somewhat un-noticed in the corner for a few minutes. Besides that, when asked for alternatives on accompanying sides for the Baked French Toast (read above re: allergy), the waitress was not being very helpful and had a poor attitude towards the situation.   Overall, it was a good meal. The Baked French Toast was unique to me so I would come back for that. But otherwise, I am not a fan of long line-ups and would consider a nearby alternative if I were in the area again next time."}
{"text":"In my entire time living in Toronto I have never encountered such a rudeness displayed by the staff. Bonjour Brioche is one of those places where I actually feel physically ill that I gave these people my hard-earned money.   Our experience: My girlfriend and I decided to meet my cousin here for Sunday brunch and chose this spot based on some good hearsay. We got in right away - a small table by the second door near the back. Which was always open because somehow someone decided it was a good idea for the lineup to form here and go out the door. Did I mention it's -15 outside? We ordered our meal - I had the grilled chicken sandwich, my girlfriend had the crepe special, and my cousin had the quiche special. I was surprised to find that my sandwich was small and pathetic. Something you'd find on an appetizer tray at a party. Didn't even come with a side salad like every other meal. My girlfriend's crepe was okay - but hardly a crepe. It was in a dish and was greasy. The only decent plate was the quiche.  Now here's where a mediocre experience turns into an awful one.   Our bill arrives and we promptly pay with cash (because that's the only option - which is ridiculous in itself) and leave a generous tip. My girlfriend gets on Uber to call for a cab and find out it will take 5 minutes. We decide to wait at our table for our cab to arrive since it's horribly cold outside and snowing like crazy. No biggie, right? Wrong! A waitress named Lindsay comes up to us and says \"So you guys are waiting for your cab right?\" We respond \"Yes it will be here in 5 minutes or so\", to which she replies \"Ok well you need to get out because I need that table of yours\"  ...What!? I almost thought I heard wrong. We were there for an hour at best, paid with a healthy tip while tolerating the mediocre food and cold coming from the door - and this is what we get? Attitude from the rudest, most pathetic excuse for a waitress I've ever seen in my life.   Cliffs for those who don't want to read:  - Small, dirty cramped environment - Mediocre food - Inefficiencies - RUDE STAFF (especially Lindsay the waitress)  This is probably the only restaurant in Toronto where I'm going to recommend you to don't even bother trying - these people do not deserve your hard earned money!!  Go to Starbucks instead. At least you'll receive better food and service from friendly people."}
{"text":"I've been in here many times since my first review - and it is always top-notch.  Last two times there has been this new waitress, and she is spec-fucking-tacular.  So so so sweet, chatty but not invasive, and remembers you between your visits (then again, who wouldn't remember moi?).  We came in this week for a late lunch and on our way out she gave us two free baguettes.  What a sweetie!  Try the fig tart if you don't normally get savory items with figs.  I also tried the asparagus and brie tart - and it was deadly good.  It's the perfect meal really - omelette/other egg item, salad with amazing dressing, and baguette with nice spreadable butter.    If you have space I'd suggest cramming in a croissant or a sweet tart.  Everything is delicious!  Remember - cash only!!  And I have never hit up a line on a weekday."}
{"text":"Menu was smaller than expected, with daily specials written in chalk on the blackboard. Debated the omelette of the day (chorizo, asiago, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions), but ended up getting one of their signatures, which immediately caught my eye when we finally squeezed ourselves in 20 min later.   The croque madam: lightly toasted brioche layered with ham & gruyere, topped with an over easy egg, sliced baquette and fresh greens... ahhh, why people rave about this place.   For dessert, snuck in a few bites of the thick french toast. Sweet deliciousness. Could not get over how GOOD it was...and I don't even like french toast. Honestly, if we could've captured that first moment.   According to the couple sitting next to us, the quiche was the best quiche he had ever had. Wow. Ok, already planning next visit.   And though there was a line-up, we weren't rushed out. In fact, we were offered a platter of decadent-looking cakes & tarts. Twice. Declined once, almost accepted the second.   Charming & tiny - seating less than 30 ppl - this Leslieville brunch spot is a clear favourite. Couldn't even tell you when a good time would be to go. Ask the morning people."}
{"text":"I love this place for so many reasons. If I lived close by, it would probably be dangerous but even though I live in the suburbs, I still love to trek down to Queen East and come here. Why?  - Cozy atmosphere. Perfect for brunch with a friend or two. Not good for large crowds though. This place gets pretty busy on the weekends.  - Great Brioches! Actually, I've been craving one for some time now... and the peameal bacon is delish. Hmmm I think I should head down again this weekend.. :P - Friendly staff and very patient too since I can be undecisive on what to get because everything looks so good!"}
{"text":"Bonjour. Ce restaurant n'est pas worth the wait, dans mon opinion humble. Split with friends a smoked salmon omelette (decent), a mushroom/pesto/roasted red pepper omelette (meh), and french toast (yummy). Also ordered blueberry lemonade which was exceptionally tangy, but good. We had a super friendly (which is a rarity, according to my friend) and cute waiter.  I would not come back here. The food just wasn't good enough for me to justify trekking down to the east end, waiting 20+ minutes for a table, waiting  20+ minutes for food, and paying cash-only. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow and menu not all that exciting, although their specials did look more interesting. Tried the Croque Madam and French Toast. French toast was really good as they make the brioche in house. Croque Madam was mediocre but the house-made baguette was fantastic."}
{"text":"Not the best breakfast. Nothing. Tasty or succulent. But somewhat tasty tarts. They need to upgrade the menu and not serve dishes with a 4 leaf salad"}
{"text":"I've been to Bonjour Brioche a couple of times and every time's been a delight even if we had to wait in line or sit in the heated patio during colder days.  What brings my bf and I there for weekend brunch is their spicy bacon sandwich - it is AMAZING. I tend to scope out the daily menu to see if it's there.   The service has always been friendly even though they're always super busy.  Sitting in the patio in the winter is fine, it's heated and they even offer blankets.  Would be a solid 5, but sadly the spicy bacon sandwich isn't a permanent item."}
{"text":"J'aime ca.   Came here for the first time today. I have been meaning to try this place for a long time but was sort of turned off by the stories of its infamous long lines on weekends. My DC and I arrived a bit after 10AM and we just had one group ahead of us, and waited 5 minutes. Not bad at all. Although, during our brunch we watched as the line grew longer and longer (by the time we left, it was almost curling around the block).   The service is prompt. I think everyone is aware of the line, so the wait staff are very quick at taking orders and clearing dishes immediately. When we sat down, we were asked right away whether we'd like some coffee and croissants to start. I just had a tall glass of freshly squeezed OJ.   I ended up deciding on the quiche de jour, which had spinach and feta. They also have a lorraine available every day. The quiche came in a generous portion. The crust was buttery and flaky and the filling with delicious (the eggs were fluffy and light, not too dense). It came with a pretty standard side of mixed greens with a basil-y vinaigrette dressing, and their lovely baguette served warm with butter. The DC had the Croque Madame, which looked like the perfect hearty hangover brunch.   Mid-way through our brunch, the owner very apologetically asked if we could move tables to accommodate a large group. It was no problem (we just had to slide over one table), and she gave us each a croissant of our choice for free as a 'thank you'. I opted for the chocolate croissant, which I enjoyed later this afternoon. It was just perfect -- soft, flaky, fresh, without too much filling.   Other notes:  - Tables are very close together and some groups of 3 were sharing just a tiny table meant for 2.  - The side patio looks nice.  - Cappuccinos come in those huge bowls.  - Clock on the wall is 7 minutes fast.  - According to my DC, this place is a \"gay hipster mecca\". I dunno. The crowd seemed pretty mixed to me.  - Bill Cosby ate here apparently; his autograph is on the wall.   All in all, a nice brunch spot but I don't think I would line up more than 15-20 mins. for this place. The food is great, but there are also lots of other similar places that are less hyped with no lines."}
{"text":"Annoying things: cash only, long waits Great things: tasty cocktails, delicious food (making the long waits worth it :)  I had a grapefruit mimosa and iced Bailey's latte and both were phenomenal.  I wasn't overly hungry so ordered the yogurt and granola bowl that turned out to be massive and loaded with deliciousness (all kinds of fruit, nuts, homemade granola, mmmm). My friend had what I believe was a meatloaf sandwich with greens on the side and she was very pleased (plus the sandwich was big enough she took half home for dinner). We both bought treats from the bakery to take home as well - I got a creme brulee tart and an apriocot pastry.  Both were amazing, but the creme brulee tart was out of the world - highly, highly reccomend it!  Only reason I've given it four stars is I had ordered a royale brioche to split with my friend during our meal and wasn't informed until well after our food came that they had run out - would have been nice to know this at some point during the 30-40 or so minute wait for our food that it wasn't available so I could have looked at the menu again to see if there was something else we could try.  By the time they told me it seemed pointless to try to order something else.  Nonetheless, I'd love to go back and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place also with amazing baguettes if you need some. I'll be a frequent here."}
{"text":"Great place for some early morning goodies! We went out of our way to come grab some pastries and coffee before a long drive back to NY and this was great! The staff was extremely nice and insisted that we sit and take our time to eat, but we had to go. :( Along with our coffees, we got the blueberry custard, a pecan butter tart and a raisin butter tart. They were all delicious - especially the blueberry custard!   Definitely check out this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place was on Queen St East for over 10 years, before new restaurants and bakeries started popping up and I am sure it has something to do with the gentrification of this neighbourhood.  The menu is fairly extensive and not the egg-and-bacon-and-home fries you find at some local greasy spoons. The sandwiches are overall good but it's the brunch that people come here for.  Scrambled egg on a bed of rosti potatoes and a slice of smoked salmon is garnished with chives, a dollop of creamy horseradish and a small drop of caviar. The presentation definitely whets the appetite. The baked French toast is very dense, almost bread pudding like, layered with cinnamon and caramelized sugar and portion is very generous.  The café features soup, quiche, omelet and savoury tart du jour, written on the two chalkboards. The tarts are my personal favourite. The flaky pastry holds a trio of ingredients, (always one kind of cheese and two other what-have-you) generally creates a great harmony. The portion is small, but it is rich and packed with flavour, so every bite counts. On the side is a wedge of baguette and house salad. However, the butter on my baguette on most visits is clearly straight out of the fridge and hard to spread.  Among the bakery selections, the croissants and baguettes are their stable best sellers, then there are the desserts. The flourless chocolate cake is dense and moist, rich but not too sweet. The very French almond pear pie is also memorable: thinly sliced pear tops a ground almond paste, similar to marzipan, in a lovely pie shell.  The servers are friendly but given how packed they normally are (there is always a line out the door on weekend), it's not always the most attentive. One time, the glass of water I asked didn't come until I was almost done with my meal.   The place does not take anything except cash but have recently installed an ATM there.  Last, you can take the gal out of the café but you can't take the café out of the gal. After a meal, you will smell smoky and buttery for hours from the heavily fumed air.  For a great meal, I am definitely willing to overlook the above, because the food is always worth it."}
{"text":"It is true, when I feel like going for breakfast I don't necessarily want to drown myself in a grotesque plate of bacon and eggs, while some guy at the table next to mine burps out his beer from the night before.   On these occasions, Bonjour Brioche is a good brunch option.  The place is quiet, quality, and has a lovely European feel to it.  Unfortunately with that feel comes an unfortunate attitude carried by the staff.  It is as if its patrons are American tourists barging into its Parisian idyll.    I think next time I go there to enjoy a lovely French breakfast, I will outsmart them by speaking French.  Most likely the only French word the wait staff knows is bonjour, I'm guessing they are hard pressed to figure out what a brioche is."}
{"text":"Alright everyone, easy with the haterade.  This place is good, 5 star good.  It has great food,  and hey look it's a bakery & cafe, not a restaurant.  If people are poo-pooing it with low reviews, complaining about limited seating, you're soured by your own expectations instead of being open to the wonderful experience at hand.    I know, I know, those are fighting words.  To back them up I present to the jury the following facts:  1. I typically don't bother reviewing places if they have more than 10 reviews, but I'm reviewing it anyway because it's that good.    2. I'm reviewing it 7 months after I was last there as I still think about it because it's that good.    3. Oh, I also ate there three days in a row and canceled other Toronto home town travel stuff to do so because it's that good.    4. I have taken to looking at home prices in the area pondering if I sold my place in Vancouver, and moved to Toronto, how often could I eat there because it's that good.    Really, just go and yes I'll be jealous of you."}
{"text":"favourite things about bonjour:  - fast take out on pastries and bread - super yummy food! - decent prices - cute patio  cons:  - there is almost always a line up around the corner - cash only - almost all of the servers i've ever had seem grumpy and frazzled  ultimately, it's still one of my favourite brunch spots. delicious croissants, soups, sandwiches, and more! i just try to go during off-peak times."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday and I had read about the line-ups and so I was prepared for that, no problem.  The food was excellent, the dessert was excellent and although I am not a big coffee drinker, the fact the refills were no charge and readily available was very positive. I have read several reviews from people claiming that the staff was rude or that the service was poor. Contrary to this, I found that everyone was very nice and very professional.  The place is very busy and if they have to ask you to move out of the way or line up outside, don't take it personally, that is efficiency at work and not rudeness. One, and only one issue that I had was with the shredded potato thingy.  It needs to be fixed or cease to exist.  Thanks."}
{"text":"You know when you spot your seat on a plane to notice that your seatmate is spilling over into yours with love handles, and you know from then on that the experience of building your own protective hot pocket corner of a space you're about to embark on is something you should mentally, emotionally, and physically prepare for? That's the situation here, possibly including said sprawling love handles. You approach it, you know what you're getting in the 6 table space: long waits and tight squeezes. So, the reviews mentioning these two things come from just not taking notice of these facts before kicking off an adorable and delicious meal.   I don't take The Best Brunch title seriously, and I'm not out to competitively eat finding the title winner. I take this place seriously though, as serious as they take baked french toast and peameal bacon. If I want meat + bread + butter, it's this. Don't mind if I do, you adorable french grandmother I've always wanted."}
{"text":"Came at noon on the friday before Christmas eve and there was a bit of a wait. (About 3-4 parties in front of us). So, we opted to sit the covered patio area, which had heat lamps. It was fine, but would have preferred to sit inside. Probably the most canadian thing to do is to have the patio open in December.   The food was decent, but not amazing. I had the smoked salmon with eggs. The eggs were great, and you get one small slice of salmon. For the price, it was decent value. They gave a piece of bread on the side with cold butter, which I thought was very odd. The bread wasn't very good. The bread was cold and since the butter was a cold as well, and I couldn't spread the butter.   The croissants were good. Very buttery and flakey. The almond croissant is not like other almond croissants I've had. It was tasty, but not what I would expect. We got them as they were still warm.   Overall, this place is decent, but no worth waiting in the cold for. Their servers are pleasant/nice, though a little rough around the edges. They over poured the water in my glass and it flooded the table. We had to change table cloths."}
{"text":"This review is only to notify the owner that they need to take a really close look at some of the customer service. My business partner and I came from up the street where we had grabbed a coffee at Starbucks and upon seeing the croissants decided to try some. After purchasing we sat for a moment because we had been walking and got hungry. One of the ladies behind the counter told us that we were not allowed to remain in the building because we had coffee from another establishment (but still have given them our tender for their product, just not ALSO their coffee). We left, but we wanted to get a few more as a gift and my business partner went back in and tactfully tried to tell the lady we were just needing a seat for a moment. She proceeded to tear into him, calling him inconsiderate and ignorant for even considering bringing coffee into an establishment that serves coffee (awful coffee at that) and WHO DOESN'T SERVE COFFEE these days? It's like telling someone they can't buy a shirt at your store because you are wearing a different brand. She was abusive and dismissive and finally said \"I don't care, just get out of here\". We will no be back because of this event unless the owner is able to inform us that the service has improved and until said time I would encourage everyone to go elsewhere, the lack of consideration leaves the most foul taste in one's mouth."}
{"text":"This place is mighty tasty. The entire restaurant smells like freshly baked breads and patisseries. I had the french toast with fresh fruit - it was a little too sweet for me. The french toast is more like bread pudding cake with chocolate bits and lots of added sugary bits. We also had the Roast Beef sandwich which was Very Good! I would definitely recommend it if you're deciding on a sandwich. The third dish that we had was the smoked salmon.. The hash browns were on the burnt side and the smoked salmon was mediocre. I guess perhaps you should stick to the croissants.   The inside the place gets really hot with all the baking going on - so we sat outside which was nice. There seemed to only be one waiter - so if you are in a rush - this is not the place for you. Overall a very cozy and cute place. The waiter was very nice too. They also accept American dollars.=)"}
{"text":"the tarts especially the fig blue cheese is wonderful. actually all the food is.  Cash only. Packed on Sundays Only open to 4:00 sometimes in gets a bit smoky."}
{"text":"Always amazing! Great good, great device, great prices.. We always order off the chalkboard and love everything we get.. They are great at accommodating for us, we always order one soup to share and they bring it in two bowls.. The little stuff like that makes us come back.."}
{"text":"Five star brunch brought down a star by weak service. The Eggs Benedict was excellent, hot chocolate in a bowl was good, and they have a nice patio.  The bad news is that the service was lacking. The woman running the joint was straight up rude and gave the impression she really didn't want to be there; she fully rolled her eyes and sighed when I asked if it was possible to sit on the patio. Our server was alright but not super friendly and she seemed like she was in a ridiculous rush, which was odd given that there were plenty of servers and the place wasn't that busy.  I got a few croissants to go and they were phenomenal."}
{"text":"VIBE  I'm going to sound like a cliche but this place really is quaint and charming. Their patio, though, a bit shoulder to shoulder is a nice little alcove outside of the restaurant. I also love that they have little blue blankets if you get cold. See? Charming! More charming: those flowered fabric table cloths. See? Quaint. I love the French flair.   The service is a bit hit and miss. Maybe the waiter wasn't a good multi-tasker? I don't know. But if you're in a rush, forget it. Make sure you have some time. They don't greet you at the door. It's too busy so find your own spot.   I ATE  Their poached eggs on salmon with hollandaise on top of a croissant did not disappoint. It was a bit of a carb overload with baguette with butter but such a fantastic indulgence. The baguette and butter are fresh, fresh, fresh.   I've had their croque madame before and it's pretty good. I'll have to remember to take a few croissants home with me next time.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I highly recommend gorging after an intense spin class at Quad down the street. Plus, these guys say \"Bon Appetit\" when they serve you. Magnifique! Remember: if you're in a rush, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"a charming spot for great bread. the croissants are flaky and delicious. the place is often packed and service can be slow."}
{"text":"This place will always have a little piece of my heart; it's the first place I ever tried a chocolate croissant as a child. I've moved up to the brunch menu as an adult and I brought my partner recently. The food is delicious yet simple, light yet filling. While it is a small space, its coziness is a part of its charm."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to Bonjour Brioche even though I pass it everyday on the GO train, gotta love commuter life!   It's a small cafe with a small seating area and luckily we got a seat quite quickly but people were waiting upwards of 15 minutes for a seat.   It's a slice of parisian heaven in the city! If you've ever visited Paris you really feel transported! They have framed Paris street pictures up everywhere and a hot food station where you can buy fresh baked brioche, croissants and sweet or savoury tarts.  I had a delicious croquet madame Nd my friend had the brunch plate, we split a creme Brule, she had a chai latte and I a Sangria. ..because it's always 5 o clock somewhere!!  Overall loved the spot!!  Tips: - closes at 4pm  - show up early!! - parking is a b*tch to find but most of the street parking on Degrassi is free - cash only! - of you cannot get in go to Lady Marmalade down the street or Tabule next door"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place on a Saturday. We arrived around noon and by 1 p.m. it was already packed and there was a short line up outside.   The food was amazing and this would have been my favourite brunch place if it were not for the slow service. We ordered fresh juice and frozen hot chocolate but our drinks didn't arrive until 20 minutes later. Our food took almost half an hour to arrive. We also ordered their croissants and those should have been served while we waited for our mains but they came together.   The hot chocolate was good but the food was the best.  We had the seafood risotto, bbq chicken sandwich and salmon eggs Benedict. The star was the risotto, which was very creamy and full of flavour.   I would definitely go back but would not go on a day when I'm in a rush."}
{"text":"Hmmm not sure what the hype is..walked in with empty coffee cups in hands, were told right away \"WE DONT ALLOW coffees in here...ummm \"They were empty...\"please direct me to the garbage can,\" I said..to which they pointed outside....and said WE ARE CASH only...  Ummm hmmm now that we exchanged pleasantries and they lived up to the typical \"French Stereotype,\" let's move on to the food...  I ordered the famous Savoury French Toast Treat and my better half ordered the Omelette Du jour...  My French Toast was extremely tasty! Soft bread with perfect amount of sweetness, cinnamon, and yuminess.. Omelette came with small French baguette and nice piece of French butter which tasted not so French...  In the end it was nice to hear the French Accordianish music in the back ground...and our waitress was extremely gorgeous."}
{"text":"It works for me as long as I dont have to line up. Things are delish, quite a few items on the menu like the benny special and the layered eggs and bread and ham thing taste good. A bit pricy, juice is 4 or 5 dollars.   If they are busy they can be extremely slow. In that case, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I want to like it here.  I didn't show up being a hater, I swear.   The good: - Their food is good.  It's actually very good.   - Their baguette is inexpensive for this area.  The bad: - The service for take out is terrible. - The person at the cash register ignores me consistently. - The servers cut me in line and the cashier cashes out their bills consistently. - I can say hello as many times as I want to the people behind the counter and it doesn't mean they will serve me. - My complaint is pretty much the service which is terrible every time I come here.  Would I go here again?   Yes.  But only because there are no sandwich shops in Leslieville.  If there was a competitor - I would never set foot in Bonjour Brioche again."}
{"text":"I usually like to have brunch at establishments that offer an array of egg-inspired menu options that include some type of meat, such as pork or beef. However, Regina and I wanted to be adventurous, and considering that we both enjoy pastries, we decided to have a Parisian-inspired brunch. After some back and forth, we decided to try Bonjour Brioche on Queen East.  I arrived at the restaurant about 10 minutes before Regina, so I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the exterior of the restaurant. When satisfied with my exterior shots, I proceeded to go inside. When I walked in I was holding my camera, and I got this distinct feeling from the staff that they did not appreciate me taking pictures. Are you for real? The unpleasant looks I received set the tone for the meal we were about to have.  There are several flavors available, but I chose the Blueberry Custard because I love blueberries and custard. They were $1.85 each. My first impression of the brioche was that it would be dry and cold. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was in fact soft on the inside, with a flaky crust and a creamy filling. I was very pleased.  For my main I wanted a dish that included eggs, so I ordered the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs with chives, rosti potato, creamed horse radish and caviar for $11.50.  I had originally asked our server if it was possible to get the eggs poached. He said no because they did not have any water boiling. Ok. After all, it is quite challenging to boil water (sarcasm here). So I asked if sunny side up would be too much trouble? Ok, so maybe I was starting to get annoyed. But he said that they could do that. Regina and I were still deciding, so when we finally knew what we wanted, a different server came to take our order, and she said that no, I could not get them sunny side up. (*Sigh, this is getting ridiculous!) So I told her that her colleague said it would be okay. She gave me a look of annoyance and went to check with the chef. \"Fine\", she said when she returned, he will do it because the other server already told you we would. Wow, I did not ask you to perform surgery! Then to really piss them off, and certainly not intentionally because I do not eat onions or their family members, I asked for no chives in my meal.  She seemed to be writing our order and all the details on her pad. Now, below is what I received. Can you spot the chives?  Overall, it tasted okay. I got sliver of smoked salmon, bread that was a bit too tough for my liking (so much so that I feared cracking a tooth), an overcooked potato rosti that was devoid of basic spices such as salt, and chives that I had asked to be omitted. Because I like simple food, I finished it, but only after adding salt to the eggs and potatoes.  Regina got the omelet special with roasted peppers, onion, spinach and cheese for $10.50 with a mixed green salad. Overall Regina was happy with her meal. The onions were caramelized, the eggs still a little runny (we like this), and the salad had a nice vinegar and rosemary dressing.  Also, we paid $40 and never got any change. Regina paid, so she was okay with this because she is very polite. I would not have been so kind. I believe in tipping appropriately, but the tip should ultimately be left up to the customer. Talk about an appropriate ending to such a mediocre experience.  So, would I return? I would certainly be willing to pick-up a blueberry and custard brioche to go, but I would definitely never dine in again. Such terrible service, even if accompanied by amazing food would not be enough to entice me into a second visit."}
{"text":"Brioche continues to be my fave destination for lunch when i am in the east end.  This is my fourth visit to the lovely neighbourhood joint.  We walked in and it was packed as usual, we were lucky to be seated right at the window.  Their drink menu is solid, they have beer and wine, but i love their cocktails.  Other then the Ceasar, all of the mixed drinks were $5, we chose the sangria.  This drink can be hit or miss, but i was confident that this would be the former since i have had a such a lucky streak with this restaurant.  The glass came to the table with a bevy of fruit a top, and my favourite part was the ice cubes.  Now any lush would never have ice cubes, because that equals dilution.  Brioche came up with the genius idea of freezing red wine with apricot brandy to create a booze cube, perfect.  For lunch my sis and i split two sandwiches, the first was the RARE ROAST BEEF with BRIE AND GARLIC AIOLI ON A BAGUETTE.  The sandwich is small but there is no filler, each component was executed perfectly.  The homemade baguette was the perfect vehicle for the rare and tender roast beef.  The melted brie pairs so well with the garlic, and it dint overpower the beef, it was delicious. The next was a daily special, the prosciutto sandwich with spinach, tomato, red onion, smoked provolone and mayo.  This sandwich was opposite of the first, it was full of fresh vegetables and topped with meat and cheese.  The original sandwich was suppose to come with salami, and i was disappointed but the prosciutto was a delicious substitution.  The smoked provolone was a great choice of cheese, its presence was noticeable but not overpowering.  The sandwich did come with a side salad, and my only complaint about Brioche is i find the salad is consistently overdressed and inconsistently mixed.  Overall, i continue to be blown away with the originality of what they are producing, the specials are always inciting and delicious.  Plus there are not many places in Toronto where you can eat out with a drink, tax and tip for under $20."}
{"text":"For what I've heard about this place, I was expecting a bit more. It wasn't bad in the least, and it was actually quite good. The chocolate croissant was fresh and buttery and super delicious. They serve Mighty Leaf tea which always shows me that a place cares about the tea they serve.  The smoked salmon eggs benedict were pretty decent. The bread that it was served on was not a good choice in the least. It was really hard to cut through. The knife was awful. Service was pretty slow and cold--it took forever to get a proper knife (which still didn't work). That was not the best choice of bread for the benny.  The salad dressing was good.  3 to 4 stars. Though it was good, I don't know if I'd return here for brunch. There are places I'd much rather go. If I'm around these parts in the early morning, the temptation of croissants would definitely lure me in though!"}
{"text":"\"The granola bowl that rocked our world.\"  By the time we visited Toronto, we'd already become jaded with Chicago brunch spots from Bongo Room, Jane's, Sweets & Savories to Orange, Overeasy, Jane's, Dodo, ad nausea. Hence when she wanted to order a simple bowl of granola bowl, I almost chewed her out for being not \"serious\" enough about our meals in Canada.  Ceres, god of grain, proved me so damn wrong here that I forever ate humble pie. To this day, we search aimlessly for that mythical bowl of heavenly granola. I'd also like to attribute a brilliant cup of granola yogurt parfait we had at Cafe Chloe in San Diego http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-chloe-san-diego#hrid:RuuXNOCQjmm0XO4Crxn8jw with allowing me to be with my \"honey\" today.  Onto the granola: slight touch of sweetened Greek-style yogurt, house blend of granola with at least 3 different grains. Bits of coconut? (this is from memory), bits of flax seed? or was it sunflower seed? small chunks of pomegranade and .. passion fruit?   ahh SHIIIET . n'mind! i wrote about it here!  http://www.goodspot.ca/profile/1055/Bonjour_Brioche \"tonyc\" existed before yelp. yay for me!"}
{"text":"If one of your greatest joys in life is freshly baked bread, bookmark this place immediately!   As soon as you walk in, the scent of homemade bread and pastries fills the air ... this is when I knew my 40 minute trek in the cold to Leslieville was 100% worth it. Surprisingly, my friend and I only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated on a Sunday morning, but I would imagine in the warmer months the wait could be much longer.   I ordered an omelette (they will customize it to your preferences) which came with a salad and baguette. I don't know what magical ingredients they put in their salad dressing but it was AMAZING ... they are smart and sell it by the bottle if you want to take one home. The omelette was fluffy and delicious and the baguette was incredible!- I would've liked to take a full baguette home, but when you live alone that can be dangerous ...   NOW if that wasn't enough, once you are done your brunch, they bring around a tray of freshly baked tarts ... I don't know who in the right mind has the willpower to resist this temptation, but it sure wasn't me. BEST BUTTER TART in Toronto. Go get one now, seriously.   I go to brunch almost religiously on Sundays, but Bonjour Brioche has set the brunch bar so much higher! I will be recommending it to all my friends. J'adore Bonjour Brioche :)"}
{"text":"I love the food here, but I will not return for a while until I get over being cheesed with this place. Yes I understand this restaurant jumps, but when you purposely come early to avoid the rush, you do expect better service. Instead we got hostility. The restaurant was less than half full, so we were told to sit where ever we want. We pulled two two seat tables together. After placing our coffee order with the server, another female staff member came over and gave us a really snotty lecture about how three people are expected to share a two person table. She was very rude and her attitude made my delicious breakfast sit like a stone in my stomach. Way to make your guests feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great food. Delicious. The only draw back is the surly manager/owner  who is usually miserable although there is always a line up. Then staff seem unhappy and stressed. A more pleasant welcome would make all the difference."}
{"text":"3.8  I did not get a chance to sit inside, but the side 'patio' was nice as well. I was expecting to get a cold from sitting there, but they have 3 big heat lamps which made it very cozy, even a jacket wasn't necessary! However, my neck was burning since I was right under it... which made it a bit uncomfortable. The tables were literally right beside each other, but that's nothing new for a brunch place.   The wait time was 12 minutes. Just a heads up the line died down at 1:45pm.  As usual, I ordered my eggs benedict with smoked salmon. The good about this dish was that the smoked salmon was not very salty compared to other places and it was accompanied by a huge salad with the right amount of dressing and soft warm french baguette with a huge slab of butter! My eggs were not perfectly poached...which dissapointed me greatly because I get a thrill cutting eggs open and just seeing that river of golden yolk pour out with no solids. Oh well, the hollondaise was good as well. Another thing that bothered me was the celery underneath the eggs... it had a tangy taste to it which, I'm neutral about but could do without.   The two girls beside us asked for a dessert display and by god, it looked absolutely mouth-watering and heavenly. I wanted to push the guy aside and just grab all the damn pastries and run for it.  After my meal, I headed inside to check out the showcase of pastries. There are danishes/croissants/tarts/different breads which all looked delectable, but I was pretty damn full from my meal. But no worries, 'cause I will be back.  Overall:      I've already made my mind up for what to order next. QUICHE and either a chocolate croissant or danish. YUMMAY."}
{"text":"It was a nice little place but a fee disappointments after we've read the reviews from here. This morning was Friday and they didn't have eggs benedict, only served on weekends as We were told. Madame brioche was alright, panini sandwich of the day was good but skip the smoke salmon - just tons of eggs and one small piece of smoke salmon, come on! While their coffee was good their cappuccino was tasteless. Then there's one one way to pay, CASH ONLY! they had a bank machine downstairs but again, how inconvenient. Won't return there for a while. Oh and there are a lot of bees flyin around, some went into the pastry cupboards and one landed in our drink. Good baguette though"}
{"text":"Let me be the first to admit that I am a big fan of French bistro-style breakfasts - I rank Keller's Bouchon and Francois Payard's options as well as Butler and the Chef amongst my favorite breakfast/brunch spots of all time.  With those things noted and the fantastic reviews of Bonjour Brioche listed on myriad Toronto review sites the decision for Sunday Breakfast was easy - especially since Bonjour is closed on Mondays.  Staying only a half-mile west of BB's Queen East location and waking as early as ever I first decided to go for a run in order to build up an appetite and then after a quick shower I found myself at the restaurant's side entrance only 5 minutes after the doors opened at 8am.   Making my way into the small space I was surprised to find the restaurant already half full - and by the time I left at 9:00 there was already a line of 10 waiting outside.  Taking a seat near the window I browsed the small shop's interior which features approximately 15 tables, a delectable looking pastry case, a chalkboard of specials, and a small coffee cart full of newspapers and magazines - towards the back was a kitchen with doors wide open where one could see two chefs working dough while another manned the grill.  Greeted by my pleasant server I received the small menu and coffee was poured (this time only equal was available, unlike A+U's where only splenda can be found.)  A relatively standard blend for which I was originally double charged I must admit that given the plethora of coffee shops in Toronto, the restaurant coffees could use some work.   Browsing the specials I have to admit some sounded interesting - particularly the chorizo bread pudding and the fig tart, but given the wonderful sounding options on the standard menu I instead opted for one sweet and one savory.  Placing my orders and receiving a refill on my coffee I picked up a copy of one of the local music magazines and read until my orders arrived - only approximately 15 minutes, impressively, given the hustle-bustle of the restaurant.  Served piping hot and direct from the kitchen my server asked if I needed anything else and after getting a glass of water and a third mug of coffee I was left to enjoy.   Starting with the savory - a small but succulent croque madame was presented and featured a few thin slices of black forest ham and Gruyere cheese atop a buttery brioche and topped with a single fried egg.  Adequate but certainly nothing to write home about the dish was largely a success due to the quality of the brioche while the other ingredients did their job merely adequately.  Served along with the sandwich was a very nice green salad topped with a mild oil and vinegar.  Having had incredible croques at Bouchon, B+C, and Payard I have to say I'd not order this sandwich again or recommend it to others - it was simply too ordinary and small.   Somewhat disappointed by the croque I next delved into the Baked French Toast - and I most certainly was not disappointed.  Having had a number of excellent French Toasts - both \"normal\" and \"bread pudding style\" - in the past couple years I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this ranks in the top three along with the version at Brenda's French Soulfood in San Francisco and that at The Country Club at the Wynn in Vegas.  Featuring the same buttery brioche as the croque but absolutely saturated with cinnamon and an eggy custard the toast was served with a wonderfully flavorful and warm side of pure Canadian Maple syrup and the layers of flavor simply melted together forming a singular flavor that harkened a cinnamon bun, but better.  Crisp on the outside, spongy within and ample in portion due to the density and decadence I slowly enjoyed this dish and rather wished I'd have opted for two sweets instead of the croque - really, an astounding dish showing that when done right something \"simple\" can actually be sublime.   After the great French toast I briefly considered picking up some pastries for later in the day but instead decided to show some restraint given my later eating plans.  Paying the modest bill after the double coffee-charge was removed I was pleasantly surprised that I felt in no way rushed to pay the bill or leave despite the line.  Finishing up an article in the paper about The Swell Season I made my way to the door and was bid farewell by two of the servers who appropriately offered a au revoir from Bonjour."}
{"text":"To be clear i only came there to test their croissants as i am still searching for the 'best croissant in Toronto.'  Theirs are tasty and quite buttery.  Unfortunately, the inside--although chewy as needed--is not light and fluffy as though it were slightly undercooked.   Cakes and quiches look interesting although ranging in the standard fare in terms of choice.  Would i go back?   If I'm in the neighbourhood, looking for croissants, thats probably the place I'd go to as others nearby are terrible."}
{"text":"Croque Madam was delicious and the baguette that came with it was quite good. But their french toast was a bit dense and overall dish was quite sweet. The 2 pieces of french toast paired with the fruit salad was a bit much, there are no savoury element to balance off the plate.  I also had their croissant and chocolate croissant to go, and I personally prefer the chocolate croissant. Somehow the chocolate croissant was flakier than the original croissant."}
{"text":"It's cute and charming.  The food is tasty.  The pastries are fresh and yummy.  The quiches are tasty.  It's the little touches that make this place successful, like the very yummy salad dressing they make themselves (and you can buy in a bottle.)  Personally, I could take a bath in this dressing.    This place is not without its faults, like the line up for a table, and the crammed sitting.  But, if you're in search for a place with character to go to on a lazy Sunday, this place is a very nice option."}
{"text":"Beautiful baguettes and salads with brunch, lovely croissants, coffees VERY French! I love it Usually line ups though"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission for butter tarts in Toronto, and after reading some mixed reviews I decided to try it for myself. Went on a Wednesday morning around 11-ish for some butter tarts, it wasn't too busy. The cafe is a lot smaller than in the pictures.   Went in and ordered 2 butter tarts to go. At first glance it looked like butter tarts with some pecans. But when I got home, I noticed that the pecans are actually raisins. FML. I hate raisins. There is no word or sentence that can describe my hate for raisins, except for...I hate fucking raisins.   After sulking for while I decided to eat them anyways considering I just spent $10 on them, and it would be a waste of food. The flavour is pretty good, almost a hint of maple syrup in the filling with was nice. The crust is also not bad. a good tasting butter tart....minus those damn raisins.   Overall, I wouldn't return simply based on the raisins! IF they should decided to make some butter tarts without raisins, than I would go every week for them. God, I hate raisins."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a Saturday, and it was amazing.  They make amazing French bread, pastries, and brunch all from scratch.  The pain au chocolat and all the pastry and bread we had were amazing.    We ordered the french toast, the tart, and a variation on eggs benedict, which was delicious poached eggs over small croissants with hollandaise sauce over it, and a nice green salad on the side, as well as various coffee drinks.    Overall, this is a fantastic place for brunch or picking up your bread and pastry!  I can't imagine anyone not loving this place.  Unless you're allergic to wheat, I guess.  Merci beaucoup, Bonjour Brioche!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Bonjour Brioche since it first opened its doors and have never had anything whatsoever to complain about. It has been stellar. However, we went to BB at around 10 this morning for breakfast and it was a disaster: Our dull and confused waiter told us that \"there are no croissants and will not be for quite a while\" so we ordered a simple sandwich and french toast. Our coffee was served, mine without the milk I'd asked for and I had to ask for it again - when I finally managed to get his attention. By the way, as we waited, many trays of croissants were brought out from the bakery! After waiting half an hour we asked \"our\" waiter where our order was and, after he went away for a while and came back he told us that it would be ready in about 15 minutes. A ham sandwich and a french toast! He explained that they were \"backed up\". No shit, Sherlock. We left - and received a sarcastic \"Have a nice day\" from a woman behind the counter. It is sad to see that a restaurant that has always been spectacularly well-run has been reduced to out and out incompetence and nastiness because we somehow did not think that a sandwich and a french toast should take an hour to serve."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny Saturday morning and expected to wait a bit to be seated. The wait wasn't as bad as expected, 10 minutes, but we were a group of 3 and were seated at a snug table for 2. Not so much of an issue for us girls but I would imagine that this wouldn't sit comfortably with some others.   Looking around the shop/bakery/restaurant, there were a lot of freshly baked breads and treats. There were a few tables that ordered a hot coffee beverage and croissants/bread/treats and enjoyed the warm weather and good company. But it was about 1030 am and we had not eaten yet, plus the food menu items seemed way too delicious to pass up. We ended up ordering the Baked French Toast , Spicy Bacon Sandwich and Grilled Cheese with Fried Eggs Sandwich, with a side of baguette and apricaot jam.   The food took a while to come, but it didn't bother us too much as we were enjoying the nice weather and a nice relaxing morning. When the food did come, it was hard to fit it all on the table as it was clearly too small to comfortably fit 3. Now onto the food... -Baguette: It was alright, nicely toasted on the outside, but nothing too special as some of the other reviews claimed to be the \"best\" baguette. The apricot jam was a really nice touch. But all in all, I'm not sure it was worth the $5+ price tag. -Baked French Toast: This is unlike your ordinary french toast. It tastes more like a bread pudding, which is my favourite dessert, so I loved this, but I did find it on the sweet side. It would be hard to finish the entire dish by yourself. -Spicy (Canadian) Bacon Sandwich: There was definitely a nice spicy touch to this sandwich but nothing overpowering. It was a really tasty sandwich, but personally I'm not a huge fan of bacon or meat, so it didn't hit the spot for me. I could imagine a lot of people enjoying this however. -Grilled Cheese with Fried Eggs Sandwich: Not sure whether we got the Grilled Cheese part of this sandwich, I couldn't taste any hint of a cheese presence, but the fried eggs were done just right, with the perfect amount of runniness without being too messy. Also you could taste the freshness from the arugula in the sandwich. I prefered this sandwich over the Spicy Bacon because the flavours were so fresh and clean.   Having a huge weakness for sweets and well, anything baked (!) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you prefer a continental style breakfast, get to Bonjour Brioche, though you may have to wait for a while on the weekends.  I had the crepe of the day which was a a standout, as were the pastries, however the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs my brunch companion ordered  had potential but was somewhat cold, as was the side of peameal bacon. I suspect they did a bad job coordinating the timing of dishes since my crepes were piping hot.  I tend to prefer egg based breakfasts so leave Bonjour Brioche as an occasional alternative."}
{"text":"Having a leisure lunch at Bonjour Brioche on a cold winter day with the sun beaming in does made me feels I am not in Toronto.   The small wobbling table and the cramped interior does give this place a certain \"European\" charm.   I was a little unlucky because they were all out of baguette!! But I have a craving for sandwich and that wonderful side salad. The dressing is lemony and refreshing good!   Service is like Chinese restaurant = fast, efficient and lukewarm.   I might come back for some other dishes.. but definitely not going to line up for that!"}
{"text":"I shouldn't have done it. I should not have been so naive to think that I could stop at one bite of Bonjour Brioche's French Toast. I was managing just fine with my gluten-free and vegan 'desserts' but I had to give in. Now, I'm paying for it. French Toast is all I can think about.   Being one of Toronto's token brunch spots, it's no surprise that fifty percent of the menu is focused on breakfast fare including omelettes and quiches (which are supposed to be quite good). Bonjour Brioche also ventured into lunch territory with a selection of about 10 sandwiches. All sandwich fixings are nestled between their freshly baked breads. A few slices of their baguette is also served with breakfast dishes so you're not missing out. Despite this brunch spot's popularity and long lines, menu items are surprisingly priced modestly (but let's keep that to ourselves). One other thing to keep in mind is that they only accept cash.   OUR ORDER:   Fresh Juice ($3.75) - Gets a 7/10. They had a few flavours scribbled on the black board, so my boyfriend decided to give all of the above a try with his strawberry banana orange concoction. A successful attempt to stave off his hunger. I had a sip and it was quite good. It puts the Tropicana version to shame:) Also a little thicker, which if you want to get technical makes it more of a smoothie than a juice per se.   Scrambled eggs ($10) - Gets a 7/10. Ninety-five percent of the time I go for over hard eggs at breakfast, but last Saturday the smoked salmon swung me over to the scrambled side. No regrets. Although, I can't fully comment on the dish since I ordered it without the creamed horse-radish. And in my dining experience, the sauce makes the dish. In this case, I was still content with my portion of simple scrambled eggs sprinkled chives, topped with succulent smoked salmon and caviar. Yum. The shredded potato patty looked tasty but didn't deliver on flavour. Truthfully, nothing on my plate had a chance in comparison to Keith's French Toast.   Baked French Toast ($8.50) -  Get's a 9/10.   Ordering the French Toast might have been one of the smartest decisions my boyfriend has ever made.  I've always been more of a pancake or egg girl but that's likely because I've never tasted French Toast like this before. Never.  Ignoring my Elimination Diet, I snuck a tiny piece of Keith's French Toast (which looked nothing like french toast by the way) and it was heavenly.   In taste and appearance, it resembled bread pudding and was oozing with sweetness;  so much that the serving of syrup was completely unnecessary.  When I witnessed Keith's glowing expression after his first bite, I dove in and cut a piece for myself.  I then cut that piece in half .  If this was all I was getting, I was going to make it last and savour it.  I took the first nibble and almost drooled.  Goodness gracious!  What was in the piece of heaven?!  Nevermind - I did NOT want to know.  Going back to my scrambled eggs was such a bummer.  Thankfully I had something to look forward to - the other half of Keith's dessert.  I mean French Toast."}
{"text":"Croissant review... good, but not the best.  Looks like a croissant (not too long, wide).  Good colour.  Medium flake.  Very buttery.  I'll make a note of the relatively inexpensive price ($1.60-something with tax).  Note that I purchased and ate it around 12:30... bodes fairly well because really they should be tested just out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins in the freezing cold on a Sunday morning, and I'm happy to say, it was worth the wait!  I had the spicy bacon sandwich (thanks to fellow yelpers' suggestions) and it was di-vine! Perfect balance of savouriness from the bacon, sweetness from the aioli and tomato, and fresh avocado on a perfect baguette. Yum! The mixed greens salad it came with was also very good. The house-made dressing is what made the salad.  My friends had the smoked salmon benedict on a croissant. She thought it was very good. My other friend was not as pleased with her Coque Madam but thought it was decent.  We shared a strawberry tart for dessert and it wasn't anything to write home about.  Overall: Another great brunch place on Queen East. I would suggest stick to the specials on the board that day (hopefully the spicy bacon sandwich is one of them). Come before 10am if you don't want to wait in line for more than 30 mins. Lastly, don't forget to take a few croissants to go- perfectly flaky and only $1.90 each!"}
{"text":"This restaurant use to be one of my favorites in the area until today.  I am truly flabbergasted by the treatment of one of the employees there.  My friend and myself went there with her baby. At a point at lunch the baby needed to be changed and when we went down to the bathroom there were no change tables. One of the employees said we could use the back room and he would sanitize the table thereafter. At the end of the changing an employee came down and pretty much yelled at us saying we can not use the table because it was unsanitary. We explained that an employee has allowed us to. I'm not saying she was wrong but the there was no reason to yell and treat us in such an aggressive manner. I explained to her that it's hard for a new mother to come out with a newborn and have this negative experience. In addition, there is bread on trays upstairs where people are waiting, talking and standing! That is unsanitary. People were pretty much talking and spitting on the croissants.  All in all, based on this experience I will not be going back. It's sad that people forget we were all once babies and they deserve proper treatment like another human being. Salut Bonjour Brioche."}
{"text":"We had:  croissant: I don't see this place having the best croissant in Toronto. It is good, but not stupendous. Just normal. Brioche: dry. The crust makes it taste like the same dough as the croissant. Their brioche makes me feel bad for paying 1,90 for it. French toast: shameful called as French toast. A chocolatish bread that they did something (??) and dropped some fruits so they can charge 10,50 for it. Tasteless unless you cover (more like soak) with the syrup. The crust on the top of the bread (probably 5% of the slice) is ok, but that is it. Cappuccino: average. We also paid additional 50 cents for the butter, a shame triangular unsalted measuring approx 2cm x 2 cm (isosceles) that we needed to ask 4 times to get. We almost walked away for the waiting time (and the place is not full), and we should have.  My advice: if you are following the lists of \"places to try\" and are willing to pay for anything, go ahead. If you want the best food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"...and we're back. Service has returned to \"I'm French, fabulous, and only partially care about you being here, but will still serve you with a modicum of courtesy and concern,\" which is a far cry from the former attitude of \"I'm French, and I essentially don't give a fuck about you.\"  My triumphant return to Bonjour Brioche after a one year (!) boycott was delightful. Bread pudding french toast was better than I remembered, and the carafe of red berry & orange sangria ($16) should have come with an impending warning of coma. That shit knocked me out good & proper. I got a text message from my dining companion six hours post brunch confessing: \"I think that sangria had sedatives in it. Like, actually. Just woke up from a three hour nap.\" Moi avec, mon ami!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.   I don't know what the hype is about. The croissants were mediocre, the bread was hard, butter was not even warmed or melted. The quiche was too salty and very little ingredients.   I waited for a whole year to eat at the this place only to be disappointed! We had to ask 3 times for cream and the service really sucked! The line is really not worth it! Go to a much better place next time! Save the trouble!"}
{"text":"This review is solely on the croissants. Specific to the almond croissants. I looked up BlogTOs review of the best croissants in the city... This rates number 1.  However the reason I looked for the best in the city was I was curious to compare to the THE outstanding croissants at Cherry Bomb... Which happens to be such a trek for me to go to and is a bit pricey. But alas, Sorry Bonjour.... Cherrys almond croissants still rein the best ... No idea why they were rated 10.  The croissant at bonjour was still pretty good flakey and crispy outside and softer though a bit dry inside. Not too much distinct almond taste. But it was still good. I haven't had brunch or lunch here though I've heard it is good... I have yet to review that."}
{"text":"Crazy good. We have been many times over the years and never disappointed.  I just had flawless poached eggs. I have to keep going so that I can try everything on the menu!  pastry, croissant and brioche are incredible. C'est Bon!!"}
{"text":"When people discuss going to Leslieville for brunch, (which happens more often than you'd think!) this joint is always mentioned.   So last Sunday we biked 10 minutes due east until we arrived at this crowded little restaurant.   I had the Provencal omelettte with salad. I'd never had olives in an omelette before, and as a salt hussy I was very pleased. The greens it came with were just boxed greens, and they were drenched in a vinegar heavy dressing. My friend had their sandwich special, which was a spicy bacon (meat cured in house) sandwich. It was really nice.  I had ordered their soup of the day to start (watermelon gazpacho!) which sounded so lovely... unfortunately they never brought it and then charged me for it. I caught it on the bill, so I didn't pay for it. But this incident likely brought them down from a 4 to a 3.25 star rating.   I'll likely come back here, but not until I continue making my Leslieville brunch rounds.  BONUS: Open on Canada Day, so likely open on other holidays throughout the summer, unlike the rest of Leslieville.  BIZARRE: No AC inside but built-in patio heaters."}
