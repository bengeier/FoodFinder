 They did a great job. The room was perfect and very private for us. 
We planned for 50 but had 70 people show up. They quickly accommodated us. We really appreciated that and didn't make us feel it was an inconvenience ."}

{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch on a balmy March Sunday.  We had anticipated ordering an early dinner, but during the off season, only luncheon entrees were being offered.
Ergo, since the selection was one of burgers and wraps, unless the burger is transcendent it's gonna be a three star max.  I've had my share of ten dollar burgers.  They actually tried fairly hard on this one.  Mine was the black and bleu.  (Cajun seasoned, with bleu cheese).  We were asked what condiments we wanted to accompany and they were supplied in mini-cups.  They were pre-dressed with lettuce tomato and on mine, raw onion.  My burger was tasty enough without condiments, happily.  Both burgershad an egg/pretzel looking bun, and viewing the difficulty the lady was having with her cheeseburger with sauteed onions to which she added mustard it was fortunate that I didn't require condiments.  
These buns looked good and had a nice consistency, but tended to fall apart during dining.  The lady's bun was disintegrating enough that her hands slowly became coated  in yellow; to the extent that she requested another napkin.  A tweak of the bun recipe would be in order, for sure.  I recommend knife and fork until they make a change.  The sandwiches come with house made potato chips.  Fresh made chips are always pretty good as long as they aren't made in advance.  Oddly if you want potatoes that have been sliced into fries rather than chips, there is an uptick in cost.  I guess they didn't buy a fry blade for their mandoline so it's more hassle for them.
They also offer onion rings for an uptick as well.  We both had chips and enjoyed them.
There is a pleasant view of the pond and fairways of the golf course for eye candy.We look forward to trying them again \"in season\" for dinner."}
