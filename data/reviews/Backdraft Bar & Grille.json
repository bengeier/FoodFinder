{"text":"great dive bar and enjoyed being a patron on the rare occasion, but Last night I had the worst experience I have ever had in a bar/restaurant. The service was awful. The bartender had no clue what was going on, for example... Was asked if I would like another beer and placed my request ..she proceeded to pour the wrong beer, she was very pleasant though. we had also ordered food, The food was very subpar and took quite awhile. As the night continued my friend was prosecuted by the \"bar manager\" outside, whom you could tell was a drunken mess, and asked to show ID. After replying with not the best language he showed the ID and the \"drunk bar manager\" threatened to cut up the ID. As telling the bartender inside the event, Chris I believe his name was, proceeded to tell my friend he was raised by pigs for the interaction that took place outside. Chris then proceeded to continue to insult my friend and I. We asked to close out immediately. My friend continue to tip as the bartender continued the insults. He then said he would change the tip without the signature of the patron. Needless to say My friends or I will never come to this establishment again nor ever recommend it to anyone. So if you are looking for insults and possible illegal interactions with your credit card and issued ID's, you'll be at home."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty awesome. May not be the perfect place for a low calorie diet, but I have eaten here at least 10 times and the food has been awesome. Burgers and pizza are up there, but the blackend chicken Caesar salad is my fav for only $6.  But try a burger if you have never been."}
{"text":"This hidden little secret gem is several different bars in one.  Daytime older crowd,  great after work happy hour bar, Drink specials every day and a shot of the month.  Kitchen opens at 5pm during the week. Food is FANTASTIC, and daily specials. Menu limited but gets frequent updates. After 7-8 the crowd gets younger and  DJ on some nights.  Keno, 2 pool tables,  2 dart boards, a few high tops and about 30 seats around the bar.  A classic neighborhood bar with great food at reasonable prices. (try the buffalo chicken  flat bread pizza)

Now, The review by Michelle N is total BS. 1) she admits that she has never been in the bar, and saw someone in all black, with tie, name tag and sever apron.  Sorry Michelle, the Backdraft does not require the bartenders to wear a tie and name tag, and does not allow customers to smoke inside (that's the law). I know this person and she is a customer.

{"text":"Never felt comfortable there it seems to be one of them bars that if your not a regular they really wish you would leave , me and my friends did not feel comfortable , never will return plus they need a different place for smokers to hang out besides the front door"}
{"text":"I've been staying in this area for work for years - best local bar I've been to in the area. If you are here, come by and have a drink. Great service, friendly, welcoming and perfect bar food. They even will charge your phone if it's dying. A must stop in the west burbs of the CLE."}
{"text":"Insane fish Friday's!  The fish tacos are to die for! We grew up with white fish fries in NY and PA.  We could never find a good non perch fry around here.  The fish is so light, flaky and tasty!  The warmed shell and crisp coleslaw is the perfect combo. It has a flavorful sauce drizzled topping it off.  It's beautiful! 

Fried mushrooms delightful!  The homemade batter awesome.  Homemade ranch of course! 

Highly recommend!"}
