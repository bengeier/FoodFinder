{"text":"This was our first visit to New York Bagels N Bialys but defiantly NOT our last. Food was delicious, service was wonderful our server was name is Coco she was very nice along with the rest of the staff. Come by you will enough it."}
{"text":"While the food has been good in the past, the customer service ranges from sketchy to apathetic. Today was the perfect storm of an over charged bill, chaotic service, and underwhelming order execution. Feedback during the refund process was met with a blank stare and a mumbled apology. This place seems to be running solely on inertia. I can't imagine that any new customers would ever return."}
{"text":"Bagels were worthless, potatoes were tasteless, french toast cut inconsistently so half was undercooked. Veggies and bacon looked unappetizing.  Bialys are glorified onion rolls. Prices are inflated (scottsdale lol). Everyone's food came out at different times. Every time we asked for coffee server carried individual cup to carafe instead of bringing pot to table. Waitresses seen playing with hair. If this was NY, they'd be shut down in a week."}
{"text":"Kari is our requested server each time we go for a great breakfast at NYBB !!  She does a wonderful job--great service to go along with the great food!"}
{"text":"Best bagels, bialys and potato pancakes! We've lived in the valley for 30 years and this was our first visit.... we are now customers for life!! Great to bring a little east coast to my life every now and then!! Excellent and authentic!! Great service, too!"}
{"text":"This is definitely our go to bagel place. The bagels and bialis (by the way never heard of these until coming here but they are great!)  are always fresh! Whether we take bagels to go or eat breakfast there we are always very pleased. Everything we have ordered there is delicious and the service is friendly and quick. Sometimes on weekends we bring our dog and sit on the patio. It has a very homey feel."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the Rubin Benedict and wow was it good! Loved it!! Kid friendly & mom approved,  in fact she had the Florentine Benedict... Good service and prices."}
{"text":"With restaurants or any other business you cant be perfect all the time but it's how you deal with issues when they happen that makes the difference. New York Bagels 'N Bialys failed on all counts.  We were out running errands and wanted to grab a quick bite for lunch and we thought deli and knew we were close to NYB&B. Both my wife and I ordered a cup of Matzah Ball soup along with another dish. When the soup arrived both my wife and I found that neither the soup or matzah ball had any flavor whatsoever and basically tasted pretty close to hot water. We politely mentioned to our server who took them away and she asked if we would like anything else instead. We initially declined but when she asked if we were sure we asked for some fries and somebody that seemed like a manager came along and presented us with 2 baskets of fries and apologized for the soup issue. So far that is exactly what you would expect in terms of custom,er service.  Then the bill came and we had been charged extra for the fries!. When we pointed this out assuming it was a mistake they simply said we ordered them and must pay for them. We spoke to the same manager who had brought them expecting a correction but got the same treatment. In the end we just paid and won't be back along with the many friends and family who will will be telling about our experience.  Correcting a small issue in a restaurant is simple and leads to a loyal customer base where you recommend them and extol their customer service when they dealt appropriately with a food quality issue. Go the other way and for the sake of 2 portions of french fries you lose multiple customers and probably thousands of dollars in future business.  There are many great NY style Delis in Scottsdale but I would avoid New York Bagels 'N Bialys. The soup tastes like nothing and their customer service is similarly watery!!"}
{"text":"This place makes no sense.....you walk in and there are servers, but there is also pick up window, also a register where you can order food. Do I sit down or order at the counter? I ordered at the counter, $10.00 for a bagel sandwich and fries seemed a bit high price. There are no lunch specials or combos. I ordered the roast beef on a jalapeño bagel ( They call this a jalapeño bagel.... Are you kidding me?) food was meh. There is also a bar in back where you can order drinks. At a bagel shop? This place is just going in way too many directions for me.  I don't recommend this place at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of one simply cause the food wasn't all that bad."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast while on vacation there and it wasn't bad but definitely not New York bagels.  They had a variety of bagels and other foods, which was good.  I would recommend them if your not obsessed with your bagels looking and tasting like New York."}
{"text":"Go for take-out bialys or bagels, but skip the sandwiches. We have been 20 year customers at two locations, but surely they can master a Reuben sandwich.  Apparently not.  I won't go back any more. Poor quality for the authentic-level price.  Might as well go to Subway."}
{"text":"Great service and good food..I love the everything bagel and veggie cream cheese. They also have great breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"i love this place.  great food and service.  definitely my comfort food place.  Amanda was great!!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in the Phoenix area that has bialys! I have been a fan of New York Bagels & Bialys since I was in high school and the student government kids sold the day old bagels and bialys for $1 in our classes. I now drive all the way from Peoria when I need a good bialy. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"The bagels are very dense and thick, which they say is a more traditional New York bagel. Not to my taste."}
{"text":"Rochelle was a helpful server-Friendly place for my dogs too. The eggs Benedict was really good."}
{"text":"Someone needs to tell the cook how make a Reuben Sandwich. Microwaved? I think not. The thing was dripping with almost boiling hot sauerkraut juice. Feh! Stick with what they do best: bagels, bialys and cream cheese"}
{"text":"The pile up is delicious and very filling! We received great service from Daniel, too!"}
{"text":"Kristin's review was so compelling that I had to check out NYBnB.  I too miss the smell of yeasty dough being baked while strolling through NY's Upper Westside.  There's a sign on Shea but otherwise the store's not visible from the street.  We drove under the arches of Agua Caliente Shopping Center and eventually found NYBnB on the right.  We were surprised by how big the place was.  We ordered an Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese ($2.39) and agree with Kristin that it would've been better more toasted.  I also prefer mine chewier.  They were more than generous with the cream cheese.  I wish you could pay only for the amount of cream cheese you want.   On our way out, we bought a half-dozen bag of mini bagels and learned that bialys are, unlike bagels, not boiled so the texture's lighter and lower in calories.    To me, a good crusty, chewy bagel's worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Checked in to get a PENNY mimosa!  This is my new favorite breakfast place. Amanda was the best"}
{"text":"Thanks for the great food and service, Vanessa!! Great place to relax! Great deal for the Amazing food."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrible. I hadthreepeople walk past me while i waited at the counter. Had no idea if i was suppose to sit down or order at the counter to eat in. Nobody asked me. When i told them i had never eaten here before, the gal was NO HELP. I clearly stated that i did not want some thing on my sandwich and it came with it anyway. I also got my sandwich served in a bag at the table, i guess that answered my question about where i was suppose to order. If this place plans to stay open in Scottsdale, they better get some better service going. Now i know why places with good food don't survive!"}
{"text":"Had half corned beef, half pastrami - great.  Rye bread, kosher pickles, slaw, onion rings were NY style.  All 5 star."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot... Never had a bialy before, but well worth a try.  Rick was attuned to all our needs."}
{"text":"Best Bagels 'N Bialys!  I love that they have lots of variety.  You can call ahead and place your order for pick up.  Its located in a strip mall across from ED Marshall Jewelers.  The place is not the cleanest looking inside so I do hesitate to eat there so that is why I've given it four stars. Its been around for a long time and could use some sprucing up!  I purchased a groupon on Yelp which helped a lot with the cost.  Carried home some lox that were good but very oily.  Cream cheese was tasteless, somewhat runny and not thick like it should be."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service from our waitress Kari and other staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly, what I considered to be, by far, the best and most reliable bagel shop in the valley seems to just not care anymore. The last several visits, some bagels had the texture of not being boiled before they were baked. The taste is now hit-or-miss, as well. The other day I was in the store and didn't recognize a single employee. If they're having new people make the bagels, they need to stop now. Several bialys were undercooked and odd-tasting and, again, a few bagels were off in their texture, as well as taste.  It's bad enough that business seems to have been non-existent since the move to the new location, you can't afford to screw up your main selling point.  I just can't recommend this place anymore for bagels."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional and the staff was very friendly. Kari was our waitress and she was very sweet and helpful. The food was soo good i even ask for the chefs name (zach) just so i could complement him on the food."}
{"text":"Drive 25 miles to get the best, Chicago-like bagels in the valley. Not puffy or doughy. Fill my freezer on Wednesday. Buy 12, get 6 free! Such a deal!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for a very long time . I had ordered food from there deli told the girl when she was done too let me know when she took care of my order, .told her we were having breakfast so I  assumed  when we were done my order would be done . When I came to the register to pay I found out they didn't even take care of my order. The manager started yelling at me and told me it was the busy day of the year instead of apologizing for not processing my order. I think that was terrible. Shame I n them ."}
{"text":"Our Waitress Jessica, was sweet and very attentive. The food we ordered we hot and very good.  Francine C El Paso"}
{"text":"Great challah and bagels! Fast service for to go orders! Always a different cream cheese of the month. Huge bteakfast portions! I could probably split most of it."}
{"text":"The secret to a good bagel is the water.  You can't replicate a NYC bagel without the water.  However, the bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys come darn close!  I lived in Huntington, Long Island.  My favorite ritual was on Sunday's (in good weather) to grab a New York Times, bagels and cauwfee and spend my morning on the beach.  I wasn't sad to leave Longgggg Island, but I do miss my favorite Bagel shop on Walt Whitman Highway.  (And, by the way, to this day, I still have  bagels shipped to me from H & H Bagels in Manhattan.  Drop me a line and I'll give you the Web address or Google them)  The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys have the right consistency - not too doughy - not too thick.     I say BOO HISS to Chompies and Einstein Bagels.    The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys just might be good enough for me to want to create a new Sunday ritual.  The store ain't no beach, but a New York Times and one of these bagel might be all I need to recreate the experience (and I can always play a Brookstone CD of sea waves crashing)."}
{"text":"Haven't had bagels this good in 20 years since we left L.A. for NC which is a bagel wasteland. Pastrami on rye was also excellent, just the right temperature on really good rye bread they make themselves. Fries were disappointing. Service was good."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a killer breakfast sandwich after lunch hours and I was blown away.  You have to try the egg and bagel pile up. ..outstanding!"}
{"text":"A must stop for lunch when visiting Scottsdale. Ask for Vanessa - she's the best!  Great service, friendly people and amazing bagels!"}
{"text":"Great corned beef and potato knish. Even pickle and Cole slaw good. Black and white cookie just as I remembered from childhood in New York . Picked up bialys for me and dozen for daughter...so good..never had seen in different flavors before! Highly recommend this restaurant. Worth the trip from Glendale."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone so friendly  and greets you the most warmest  welcome upon arrival. I recommend you sit in Felicia's section but can't go wrong whoever waits on you. The Bagel, scrumptious, egg omelets cooked to perfection.  Need I say more. 5 stars----without a doubt.    Trust me you will not find a better place."}
{"text":"Love their challah French toast and bagels. Great breakfast!!!  Felicia was a great server. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I met owners at Scottsdale gateway alliance party, Ruth was awsome! So gave this place a try 2 days later, love it! Felt like i was in nyc ! Food was awsome, Lillie my waitress was awsome ! My new hangout! Bagels are the best, i thought maybe you brought nyc water in to make them! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"The omelette and sides were amazing! Our server, Rick, took special care to keep our coffee cups full and made sure our visit was awesome. We purchased bagels and challah to go on our way out from the discounted rack by the door. Rick made sure we had plenty of freezer bags to ensure their quality. We will definitely be back. Thanks for making us feel at home and so welcome."}
{"text":"Went here last month on a visit to PHX.   Good authentic atmosphere and good service. Staff were helpful in helping put together a take out. quality good.  prices good.  tastes good. Try it out."}
{"text":"Great service. I love how the server ask for our names, it made it very personable! It was the best corn beef hash I have ever tasted a credit to the chef!  Everyone seems to love their job and it shows in the cooking and staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always a great way to start a Sunday morning. My omelette was delicious and our waitress Jessica could not have been nicer.  She remembered everything about our order right down to my \"lightly toasted\" bagel! Thanks N.Y. Bagels for a great brunch."}
{"text":"A very nice spot for our family while in Scottsdale.  Great service from Rich and the whole crew during brunch today.  For example, I was asked three or four times whether I needed refills on my coffee.  The portions were generous and the menu is quite extensive.  Well worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Very good bagels! I'm submitting a review on the salads. I ordered an Asian salad (expensive) and it consisted of a plate of lettuce, dry chicken pieces, and (good) crispies, with dressing on the side. Nothing else on the salad-expensive. My friend enjoyed her 1/2 bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"Love love love having this great spot within walking distance! I go for the breakfast potatoes. Hands down the best I've ever had! Savory and spicy with a hint of sugar. Always browned to perfection. The house-made bagels and breads are a special treat. Also nice that they serve liquor if you want a bloody or mimosa with brunch. Great service and friendly staff. To-go orders are also super convenient."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast today and was not impressed. I have been in the past for bagels, which are great, but my breakfast was inedible. I ordered the California omelet which came with a latke and a bagel. The omelet was very overcooked and dry. I took one bite and couldn't eat any more. The bagel and latke were good. I could have saved some money and just ordered those. Will not come back for the dine in breakfast until they learn how to cook eggs!"}
{"text":"They are the best. I go there a few times a week and they always take care of me. Everyone who works there is nice and the bagels are wonderful.   We go in for breakfast every now and then and always have a great time. Their ruben is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I'm origianlly from the East Coast (Philly suburbs) and like to think I know a good bagel and a good deli sandwich when I bite into one. NYBB delivers on both counts. The food reminds me of the time I spent on Long Island, years ago... devouring fresh bagels and big, juicy, delicious over-stuffed sandwiches...  Along with the food - the people are great too. I've never seen an employee in a bad mood -- and the owners (Ruth and Shelly) interact with customers like they are family.  The meats are lean and fresh. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming - and perfect for dogs too (outside patio is dog-friendly). The breads, deserts, everything... delicious and very reasonably priced - especially when you consider some of the places in Scottsdale seem to charge more as the portion size goes down!  Do yourself a favor, next time you have a desire for a good old-fashioned deli sandwich, or a true NY style bagel or bialy... go to New York Bagels and Bialys. I'll be there again tomorrow morning..."}
{"text":"Wonderful Easter brunch.  Fresh food and friendly service.  Bagels are best in the area."}
{"text":"First time here...Had a delicious Brunch experience.  French toast,  beef brisket, french dip.... all were amazing!     Great customer service!   Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I was having a craving for egg salad & a latke and had heard from a friend that this was a very authentic NY-style bagel shoppe.  Well he was right.  I think I paid $11 for an egg salad (on a bagel) sandwich which is waaaay too much, but again I was having a craving so it was worth it at the time.  The sandwich and latke were both very good, but next time I'll make egg salad at home and spend my $ on something else there."}
{"text":"First tip was a noon it was pretty deserted and now I know why Pastrami sandwich was terrible. Bread soggy , fries over cooked and just plan lousy And finally. Not cheap F"}

{"text":"One of the best in town! For those who are gluten free and celiac their GF bagels are excellent. Love their chives cream cheese. They also have delicious GF cookies."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Best bagels in the Phoenix area (they're boiled of course). Turkey Reuben and corned beef sandwiches are to die for. Corned beef is extremely lean with no up charge. A must if you're looking for a great Deli in Metro Phoenix. Staff is as nice as they come. You won't be disappointed eating here!"}
{"text":"My east coast Jew taste buds are dancing today! I just ate an everything bagel stick, toasted lightly, with cream cheese...  We happened to be in Scottsdale for dinner and, in looking for our restaurant, we passed NY Bagels 'n Bialys. The \"open\" sign was all we needed to go in. We haven't had a good bagel since we left Boston. And I hadn't had a good bialy since we left Cleveland in the 90s.  When we went in we saw this gargantuan menu. They make tons of flavors in bagels and bialys. Plus they make sticks. I haven't had a bagel stick in forever, either. It took about two minutes to pick out a dozen. I could barely contain my excitement. They sliced them up for us, gave us some sleeves so we could freeze what we wouldn't eat right away and sent us on our way, $9 lighter but infinitely happier.  And I am not disappointed. It has been so long since I had a real, east coast bagel that I forgot how good they are. They doughy faux Jew food they have here just dulls the senses and makes a person forget the amazing deliciousness that we enjoy back in the real \"Jew food world\" of the east.  That said, I do have to add one caution. When I saw they also serve sandwiches I asked to taste their corned beef. I do this everywhere I see they serve it and restaurants are always kind enough to oblige. After my anticipated success with the bagels, and the whitefish and lox I saw in the case I was optimistic. Made getting my hopes dashed even worse. As soon as she set the slice in front of me I knew. Color, consistency, texture - nothing was right about this corned beef. Still, I asked for it so I felt I had to taste it. My husband described it as perfectly good Irish corned beef. I described it as dreck.  So my review is strictly for the bagels, bialys and sticks. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Most AMAZING food!!!!!! Been to a lot of deli/ bagel type places all over the country & hands down this is the BEST!!! Nick our server, helped guide us through the loaded menu & boy oh boy did he steer us right! Thanks Nick! I had the absolutely most yummy corned beef breakfast & my husband had the bagel pile up that left him speechless. Even the coffee was super good!   All the people in the kitchen seemed to also make sure we were satisfied- lovely people, lovely food & lovely service!"}
{"text":"This is as good as Jewish food gets around these here parts! I just enjoyed my umpteenth Corned Beef Reuben sandwich here and want to report that this is the place to take your Jewish friends and relatives from out of town. Unlike Chompie's, the food is authentic, it is not wildly overpriced for touristas and it's not crowded. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. The Scottsdale location is open and airy and very laid back. Only complaint might be that they need to get some of their booths reupholstered because the cushions have worn out!"}
{"text":"I am a native new yorker and lived in chicago and these bagels are like einstein bagels. The skin of the bagel is soft and not authentic. Coffee is horrible. Service marginal. Avoid this place if you know bagels."}
{"text":"It was a rainy Sunday morning, and our hunt for breakfast was not turning out so well (loooong waits at other places).  We remembered driving by this place, so decided to check it out.  We didn't realize it was an actual sit-down restaurant..cool!    Our visit started out with some awesome people watching - thanks to the girl wearing last night's make-up, a guy's Dodgers shirt, and nothing else.  Our group then decided to order omelettes, because the omelettes also came with a bagel or bialy.  This was our mistake - don't go to a bagel place expecting good omelettes, I guess.  All of our eggs were extremely over-cooked and not tasy.  The Leo omelette (Lox and onions) was pretty much scrambled eggs - not even in an omelette shape.  The bagels, however, were very delicious, but not much different from any other bagel I've had.  Our server was very efficient, though.  All in all, it was a quick and cheap-ish breakfast with some interesting people watching and good service, but overall not good enough to return to."}
{"text":"Bagels were delicious.  Great atmosphere.  Excellent customer service.  Damn good coffee, and hot!"}
{"text":"Service was good but food not all that great. It was $17 for two bagel breakfast sandwich's and two coffees.  Everything in the breakfast sandwich tasted pre made for the day and the bagel itself was very very doughy. Always like trying a new place but don't think I will be going back to this."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but it has gone down hill over the past couple of years.  I tried to order a simple BLT on a bagel  and had to repeat my order 4 times because the lady taking it kept turning around and talking to the staff.  After she finally paid attention to me for more then 5 seconds and put my order in, they guy making the sandwich comes around to verify what she put into the system.  Of course it was wrong so I clarified directly with him that I just wanted a plain BLT on a bagel.  Pretty simple right???  Well, I knew I should have double checked my order before leaving as the BLT was smothered with mustard and the bagel was stale.  Who puts mustard on a BLT?!?  Especially after I gave her my order 4 times and then directly verified it with the guy making it.  Not to mention that the lady behind the counter was touching food with her bare hands and then handling money.  I've noticed the food quality has deteriorated over the past few years but this was the final straw.....I'm officially done with this place."}
{"text":"I live right next to this place. I come here at least 3 or 4 times a week and never one time have I been dissatisfied. If you want authentic New York breakfast there's no other place to go in this town but here. Today my server was Amanda and she was an absolute pleasure to have take care of me."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Went on Christmas Day and our waiter Rick treated us like royalty. He made sure our order was precise, service was fast, and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a mullet. Business in the front, and party in the back.   In front, this place has all the characteristics of a hardworking, economically priced and noteworthy bagel/bialy business.  But in the back, they have a full-blown, totally stacked, BAR! Party time, baby!  New York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.  Their bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.  NYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks.   From the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.  I also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham! Oink Oink!  I've never been here specifically for lunch or dinner but I have tried a pizza bagel from their lunch menu for brunch. They start at $3.49, and then you can add on your own toppings for 50 cents each! No pre-made garbage here my friends, just deliciousness.   As a note, I'm only rating this place of breakfast/brunch and happy hour but FYI, they've got: sandwiches, salads, regular pizzas, nachos, quesadillas, chopped liver & bagels, potatoes and gravy, macaroni & cheese, desserts made from scratch, soups, smoked fish, burgers... oh, and they also cater.   Basically, they try to accomplish too much with just one restaurant. Food wise, your best bet is to stick to the bagels, breakfast menu and pizza bagel (the desserts look good too).  Then... after you finish business as usual for breakfast... you can come back!! Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Café in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!  NYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found. The wait staff ensemble does consist of a crazy cast of characters (they are all a little \"different\") but they provide excellent service. Everyone here enjoys engaging customers in conversation.  Therefore, instead of giving yourself a mullet (if you do please send pictures), just come here! At NYBB you get business in the front and party in the back, without having to cut your hair."}
{"text":"Laura was awesome! She really knows customer service. Best rye bread! The bagels and bialys are wonderful. The selection in the deli is pretty extensive too."}
{"text":"Never had a bialy, love them more than bagels! Had the jalapeño and Asiago bialy, really tasty. Also had the southwestern eggs Benedict, good chorizo. Tried a few breakfast bagel places in the area. This is my favorite so far."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places.  Breakfast was great and our server, Felicia, was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Yes.  Hell yes.  Now, THIS is what I'm talking about.  When I walked in and was greeted by a case with three fish starting back up at me I knew this would be good.  The case also contained many salads and cream cheeses and was accompanied with a sister case with b/w cookies, rugelach, and other assorted yummies.  Behind me was a refrigerated case stocked with not one, not two, but 6 flavors of Snapple!  AND every flavor of Dr. Browns including Cel-ray.  Had I died and gone back to NY?  If the heavenly smell of baked bagels was any indication I indeed had found my way to heaven.  The egg and cheese sandwich my husband ordered was insane.  INSANE.  Full of egg, cheese and grease.  My bagel and cream cheese, although not well toasted, was well cream cheesed and cut into fours.  The bagels were good, not outstanding, but I think with a little more toasting they would have been quite good.    They serve everything a bagel shop should.  Whitefish salad, bagels in real flavors not things like Dutch Apple or Asiago Parmesan (or whatever stupid flavors people want their bagels in these days...) and best of all, they serve tongue.  My good friend Dorian G. would be so happy to know that and I will definitely be taking her here when she visits.  Any good Jewish establishment will have this one key menu item.    So I tip my hat to you NY Bagels 'n Bialys.  You have proven my theory wrong that places with \"New York\" in the name usually suck.  Good job."}
{"text":"I always love trying new bagel places... Especially if their ratings are higher than that of Chompies (which I LOVE)...   Honestly? Don't see what the hype was about... I tried a bite of my boyfriend's Reuben Omelet, which was pretty good. My scrambled eggs seemed to taste weird for some reason... I couldn't put my finger on it, but they just didn't taste good. They didn't have the bagel I wanted so I tried their cranberry bagel and it was just very chewy and bland (I didn't even taste any cranberry at all... It was just like I was eating a day-old, pink bagel). The cream cheese didn't taste very  fresh either.  I MIGHT try this place again for lunch (which they have an awfully large lunch/supper portion of the menu for being a bagel/bialy-centered eatery... I'd rather stick with Chompies or Good Egg for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Ny Bagels and Bialys both in Chicago suburbs and in Scottsdale.  I have been a faithful customer for many years but finally I decided to write a review. As a regular customer when I have a complaint about the quality of food, I expect management to take my comments seriously.  After a discussion today with \" Adam\" who suggested he was the manager, that didn't appear to be the case and pissed me off.  The quality of bagels ( which I purchase every week and have for years) has become inconsistent.  Frequently the bagels are undercooked and doughy, but the last few weeks they sent me home with bagels that were flat like pancakes. I called three weeks ago, and again today.  Adam did offer to replace them, but I just want them to pay attention to quality.  Don't make shitty products. Have someone do a quality control check. When your product is inconsistent you risk losing customers.  I'm hoping management takes my review seriously."}
{"text":"I am giving them five stars in spite that they cannot  make an over easy egg, it comes out medium every time. I normally go in every Wednesday morning with a group of bicyclists so I have more than a few experiences with Bagels'N Bialys. I think the bagels are great, I love the corned beef and eggs and the breakfast bagel sandwiches. The ice tea is China Mist. a local company, and also fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service. I will say I was impressed by contact from the manager letting me know they changed their fries to fresh cut. I gave them another try and definitely did not disappoint. I appreciate both the message from the business owner but the great food and service. A must go if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has good bagels, but tepid service. I get bagels to go, and the last time I was there the kid making the bagels had no food service gloves on, and was taking money, making bagels, etc. Not the end of the world, but it does kind of junk you out. Another odd thing is that when you like your bagels double toasted, for some reason they put SO much butter on, it's almost like the bagel is deep fried. I haven't been back since the kid had poor food hygiene practices, but I need to get back there."}
{"text":"Food is great, I go for Sunday brunches, service could be a bit better. I have eaten many items on the menu, all brought out the way I like them."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this deli today. I walked in and felt a really good energy and was greeted right away with a table. The place was packed but they had plenty of good seating. Lots of great options to order from the menu. I ordered the Reuben sandwich, half corned beef and the other half pastrami beef. It came out hot and delicious I ate it all! I will come back very soon. Great deli in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"How dare they put rye seeds on an everything bagel? I'm not happy about dealing with that party foul at all or the rude, inefficient service. Plus, even though they are boiled here, these are not good bagels at all,  even if the rye seeds were not present. Other issue is the bagel bins are far away from customers eyes - what are hiding - put the bins up front like every true NY bagel shop. Hey, if your gonna call yourself a NY bagel place (yes I am from NY) then I want the whole experience. Charging $11 for a turkey sandwich is a bit much too and this is an unfriendly, cold location with no charm. There was a very hairy bird outside though looking for crumbs and on this day that bird got lucky. Onto the next place."}
{"text":"We love NY Bagel & Bialey! The food is always excellent and the service is great. Laura was our server today-she's awesome!"}
{"text":"ive seen many negative reviews of bagel places lately. rightly so, einstein and brueggers are kaka..  this is place has the best bagels ive had outside nyc.  probably. there was a place in portland oregon in 1993 that had great ones but i could never find them again.  anyways, these are good."}
{"text":"Our visit was in a word, sad.  And I REALLY hate having to say that. Me and my S.O. were looking forward to trying this place, with him being from New York we are always on the lookout for a good bagel.   We were seated promptly, so no problems there. The waiter came and offered to bring coffee or water as we were perusing the menu - still good. The problems came when we ordered. I ordered a nova lox sand which and I had the Yelp offer for the mimosa for 1 cent. So I tried to order it and the waiter cut me off and said he'd do that at the  end, not realizing I was trying to order the mimosa and not just trying to cash in on a separate Yelp deal. But. Whatever. S.O. Ordered the morning pile up. We got our food moderately fast and one fill up on our coffee. I still wanted a mimosa and I was going to order a black and white Cookie and a raspberry rugalah. But when our waiter returned he never asked if we wanted anything else-he simply dropped off the bill without saying a word.  He never even asked if the food was good or if we needed a water, nothing. He offered the table next to us to pack up their coffee to go and I would've liked the same but he never asked. I will say that I know the waiter may have been having a rough day, but still. A little common kindness goes a really long way. I was hoping for a great experience and a new breakfast spot, and I ended up with neither.   In summary - Coffee was just ok. Food was ok. (The morning pile up was a mess and tasted bland. My nova lox bagel was actually pretty good) Service was less than I hoped for and I strongly doubt that we will ever return."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new breakfast place open near us in Scottsdale and went there with high hopes..the place is really nice and clean but thats where the positives stopped unfortunately.   CONS not food related:  service wasnt bad, but not very attentive considering we where two of maybe 4 people there.  We were never asked how our food was or got water or coffee refills.  It was also strange that the windows inside the restaurant were being washed suring business hours by a third party up on a ladder with cleaning fluids right above where the place setting and utensils were sitting AND only a few feet away from where we were eating. I'm not a prude but that was a bit strange.   CONS food related:  food was \"Meh\". Not bad but not good..by food I am referring to the main breakfast. It was far from memorable, underseasoned across the board and the waiteress didn't notice that my fiance's potatoes that are included in most of the meals on the menu were'nt on the plate. Now for the bagels...for all the bragging and build up on the website they were a massive disappointment.  My fiance grew up in NJ and NY and she was very excited until she tasted them. Asiago bagel... was completed under cooked (doughy) and barely toasted at all..basically unedible. Might have said something but the waitress never really came back ao we just didn't eat it. There is definitely a quality control issue here and with the owner onsite i would expect her to be tasting and checking food  Anyways, not terrible overall but completly forgettable. Probably will not return. It's a shame the basics like seasoning and cooking bagels completely is a challenge for this place"}
{"text":"great bagels and bialy's, but it stops there. The wait staff are great! loved Miss Patty waiting on us. She made the meal worth not sending it back. The food is nothing special, seems like they weigh out the portions, everyone got 14 slices of barely cooked potatoes on their plate. The breakfast was basic, but everything was cooked as though it was institutional. IF you're dying for a good bagel then this is the place, but take them home and save the money for toppings for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place with great food. We ordered the bagel sandwich and breakfast Burrito and both were delicious. Our server was also amazing Kari took very good care of us!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bagels N Bialys a few times now. Its such great food and great service. Whatever you do, get the potato pancake... you will love it"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and am pretty picky about bagels. NYBB did not disappoint. I had a garlic bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was very tasty and fresh. The service was also very attentive. I would definately go back and try some of thr other goodies listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Moved...not closed (that would have been so wrong), but just moved to a new location. Wish I had checked their web site before going to the old location, which is now deserted. I feel like such an idiot for not doing my homework... ditto on other reviews... best bagels in town: yes, better than ______s and definitely better than _____s."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors, helpful staff who hustle to get you served. I'm sold! This is my favorite jalapeño cream cheese of any of the valley's bagel shop options. Try with the Asiago bagel!"}
{"text":"Twice the price of a real NY bagel and half as good. Am I missing something? Is there a secret ingredient? Bagels are small and average tasting. Not even cut in half. 2/5 stars"}
{"text":"Have been eating here since it was a hole in the wall next to the old Copenhagen store on shea in the 80's.  It went through several locations and finally got new owners and another  location.  You couldn't find nicer owners than Ruth & Shelley.  They go out of their way to make sure you're happy with your food.  You cant get a better roast beef sandwich anywhere!  Their Bialys are the best!  If you're having a party get their bialy stick sandwich tray.  You can custom order it the way you want with the side dishes to go with it.  YUM!  I finally won my husband over with their burgers, which I would never order, when I can get their small roast beef sandwich on a wheat bialy stick.  He also loves their hopple popple for breakfast.  Also I can take my doggies when the weather's nice and sit on their patio and eat"}
{"text":"Although the bagels are the best in the valley , the food is merely meh.  With the exception of the outstanding whitefish; did not try the lox. The service  was very responsive from our server but the corned beef hash I had was boring. The coffee here it is truckstop quality. So the thing to do here is to buy bagels or bialys in bulk and run . Wednesdays are the day - that's when 18 is the price of a dozen."}
{"text":"My wife and i used the yelp deal this morning to eat breakfast here.   They have the best bagel and lox in scottsdale. They also have great  home fries sauteed with vegetables.  Omelets are priced well at 8.50. We sat outside and had great service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The whole family checked this place out. The bagels were just so-so. Nit as good though as the ones from Einstein Bagels.  There was a consensus that the salmon was not at all fresh and that was a big letdown for us. Nothing great with the Reuben Omelette. The same stuff you see at joints everywhere in Arizona although this one is terribly over-priced.  The Black and White Cookie was passably good but it being sugar laden just bothered me.  Overall, I think this place is over-rated. I understand it needs to be over-priced since this is for tourists but no thanks...... I got too much common sense to smell a rip-off when I sense one."}
{"text":"Last year, my friend Alison threw a breakfast birthday party for her twins.  She had a array of wonderful goodies, among them, there were these beautiful bagels.  I got a bite into my bagel and it was heaven.  The right amount of chewiness.  I immediately asked where these bagels came from, and I was not alone, everyone at the party was doing the same.  That's when I learned about NYBB.  Now every time someone has a brunch or breakfast party, I always suggest they get their bagels.  If I am going to indulge, I better do it with great ones.  I am not from NY but a am a confirmed carb-aholic, so I think this counts as credentials. On top of everything, the owner was so amazing.  I was organizing an event for one of my parenting groups, and one of the donors backed out 4 days before the event.  I was panicking, we had a small budget and we were almost out of it since we were counting on this donation.  I called NYBB and Ruth answered.  I told her what had happened and asked her if she could give us a special discount, guess what?  She donated the bagels for our event.  That is so classy.  I am thrilled that our event has the best bagels."}
{"text":"Everyone enjoyed! French Toast was great! Used our checking in for good mimosa. Good service from Coco. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Saturday breakfast. M loves their blintzes. Today I am eating a breakfast burrito their coffee is good. A good way to begin a sunny weekend"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about a year and half, but I was quickly reminded why I love this place. Best food! The home fries are awesome. A must try! Felicia was great - friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This is a very friendly, NY style deli.  Our server, Jessica could not be any nicer or more efficient.  By far, the best blintzes west of the Hudson river.  Pastrami is very good.  Lox and bagels excellent.  Good size portions and very reminiscent of my growing up in Brooklyn.  We are there at least once a week for lunch.  Full bar available."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place for bagels... but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever. I just wish they would open on in Greenville. Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese... I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale... .n"}
{"text":"This place sucks they have a given me the wrong order five times and every time they act like it's my responsibility that I should be the one to know if I'm getting the right order or not and this last time they did not refund my money so I have to write a bad review. The man at the counter said that when they handed me my stupid bagel that he said egg sandwich, when he didn't he had said you're waiting for an order to go?  I said yes. I had checked with my mom because he was the one who had handed it to her and and when I check back with her,  she said the man had said you're waiting for an order to go? When I came back he was disputing that whole thing with me and I just said you know who's order is who's,  this is your restaurant you should know this and he just said I'm sorry what kind of a nasty attitude red hair tall gentleman I don't even care what his name it was I'm just never going back, too much if a hassle."}
{"text":"We have only been coming here for the last few months, but we firmly believe that you would need to fly to NY to get anything better!  Yes, the bagels are really good!  They're the next closest thing to Forest Hills, or Brooklyn bagels then being there. Our former go to place was Brooklyn Bagels near Desert Ridge  Sadly, they closed about nine months ago.  Great place, too bad.  We have tried a few of the other places, but weren't as happy.  So, I type \"Bagels\" into my Yelp Search.  Poof, out came NY Bagel 'N Bialys!  What's more, I noticed there was a Yelp-on Coupon tie in.  Nice!  If I may suggest:   * 1st Thing-- Buy the Yelp-on Coupon for (was $15.00 for $25.00) now $10.00 for  $20.00 of food!  Even a better deal!   * 2nd Thing--Check-in on Yelp and get a free bagel w/cream cheese smear!     * 3rd Thing-- Sit back and wonder why you've never came here before!  D'oh!!!  We cannot wait to come back for the macaroons during the Holidays!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I was stranded on a desert island and had the choice of one food item, it would be a NYBB bagel (sesame please). Along with the fabulous bagels and bialys are an exquisite selection of deli items that I love. I have tried them all over the last few decades, but my heart and taste buds belong to NYBB..."}
{"text":"My wife and I started going here about a month ago. Originally being from Long Island we have been looking for great bagels since we got here in 2003. Well we found them. This place surpassed all of our expectations.  To top it off my wife loves their Sunflower bagels and when I went yesterday to purchase a dozen to surprise her there were only 4 left. The lady behind the counter said if you want a dozen we will make fresh for you  Just come back in 20 to 30 minutes.I came back in 30 minutes and they were in a bag with 6 extras because Wed you buy a dozen you get 6 free.  I could not believe this kind of service still exists.  If you want a great bagel this is the place. Sincerely Roger and Jane"}
{"text":"This place can be hard to find because it's tucked away in the Agua Caliente strip mall area off of Shea, but it's back there.  I usually just run in for some bagels, and they are always fresh - my favorite is definitely the sunflower one!  On Saturday and Sunday mornings it can be a little chaotic up at the front counter because they don't do a line or numbers, but the wait is never long.    Only gripe is that I usually grab a coffee, and although they have creamer and flavored syrup available (a plus!), there's no milk.    No biggie, since I'd much rather support local businesses than a large chain."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had Julie as our waitress, she did an excellent job! Food was great, service was great and the environment was great.. I had the egg a bagel and it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I had a little concern a while back, and I wrote a review addressing it, nothing major though...  Still gave 4 stars.  Since then, it has been resolved and I appreciate this place even more than I did...  5 stars!!!  The staff is awesome and very friendly.  I leave this place in a good mood.  The best bagel place around, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I stopped in last weekend while heading to my office to pick up a few things.  I ordered an everything bagel with chive cream cheese to go.  The bagels were a little pricey - nearly $4 for a bagel with cream cheese, but it was quite tasty; however, they put entirely too much cream cheese on the bagel.  I had to wipe off over half of the cream cheese.  I'll definitely stop in again for a proper breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Felicia was our server and was fantastic. Great attitude and made the experience all the better. Would definitely recommend this place and Felicia to anyone coming here"}
{"text":"I had not been here for a year and thought I'd try it again. I ordered a chicken sandwich and they didn't tell me that the bread would be toasted and the chicken wouldn't be sliced. When I got home I opened the box and there was a dry chicken breast on toast. I went all the way back there and asked for sliced chicken on plain wheat bread. They took the same dried up chicken breast and cut it into little pieces and threw in two slices of bread not even bothering to put it together. I also got a plain bialy which was stale. I wasted my time and money going back there they were uncaring and I would not recommend anyone ever going to this place. The people who used to own it were so wonderful! Now they have employees who don't care enough about their customers to do what it takes to bring them back. Do not go there!"}
{"text":"I just checked in and was asked for my drink order. And I sit for 10 minutes and could not get served. So I am leaving. I know the food is good here so it's too bad this happened."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and have been several times now. As good as the bialys are, their service is awful--I stood at the cashier for a good 10 min this last week (it was slow), and had two attendants walk by without asking if I needed to be helped. Not to mention they're overpriced. That being said, their food is fine, and probably worth it if you're in the area and have some extra time and patience on your hands."}
{"text":"Very good service.   Enjoyed the whitefish salad sandwich.  Bagels are fresh too.  Comfortable place"}
{"text":"5 stars on the Super bagel selection or school here ! Great weds deal buy. 12 get 18 bagels! They do excellent in their supplied freezer bags too for later! The bailys are great too! 4 stars on the Reuben and fries."}
{"text":"So . . . many years ago I worked for a Jewish family from New York who owned a bagel shop in St. Louis on Euclid (Basically Bagels). People flocked there and for good reason. The owners were amazing people, but the bagels and bialys were unmatched. For years, I've had cravings and have periodically settled for round bread. But I just discovered this place, and these are the real deal. Take home a dozen and freeze them (bagels or bialys). My kids had one every morning last week for breakfast. I just put them in the oven on low for 10 minutes, but you could just toast them. Don't bother with bagels from the grocery store. Once you eat these, you won't settle for that other stuff. The texture is perfect. I'm partial to the everything bagel. My only \"complaint\" is that they didn't have nut bagels, as that was one of our huge bestsellers: honey walnut bagels. But with nut prices being what they are, I imagine that might be tough. :)"}
{"text":"Place is terrible. Took 45 minutes to get a breakfast bagel and a cup of soup with a bialy. The soup was wrong and our waitress informed me that \"that's the soup of the day, they don't go by the menu\". Uh, then what's the point of listing the soup of the day for each day of the week on the menu? The soup tasted like flour and nothing else.  The bialy looked like a breadstick. I told the waitress I ordered the bialy, not the bialy stick(also a menu item). I was told that's what their bialys look like. I don't know what bagels and bialys these owners tried in new york, but if they tasted anything like these bagels and bialys, I'm sure they're no longer in business."}
{"text":"The Ruben is out of this world! My husband and I got a Ruben with onion rings and a Italian grinder with fries to split. The bread on the grinder was awesome but both of us thought the Ruben was WAY better. The onion rings were basic but good and the fries were definitely above standard fries.   The person at the door who sat us was great! We had our 2 year old daughter and asked for a booth. There was not one free at the time. As soon as one emptied he hustled to get it bussed and asked if we wanted to move. That is going above and beyond!  I wanted to give 5 stars but we had a couple snags. One we ordered a large OJ but got a small and one of our sandwiches came out wrong. Our server was apologetic and got it fixed quickly on both accounts. Maybe she was just having an off day. Nothing that would keep us from coming back again and again. Hopefully our timing was just off and next time we will update to the full 5 stars.  Did I mention you should try the Ruben?"}
{"text":"I liked the breakfast. It was fast service and had a great variety of dishes. I wasn't blown away which is why I have it three stars. It also had a random flavor in the pancakes and waffle I couldn't put my finger on. It was good, but the typical flavors I'm used to are better."}
{"text":"Horrible.  They switched egg beaters for eggs.  Then, made us pay because we ate it unknowingly.  It was awful but we were hungry and figured this was how they prepared aged.  The manager was rude.  Made us pay for half because we ate it.  I wish I could give no stars. Don't blame the server.  How would a diner know with certainty that egg beaters were switched for eggs.  We only knew that when we got the bill.  Terrible customer service, even now."}
{"text":"Why is there a bar in the bagel shop?? This place is very disorganized. The placement of the bagels, coffees & creamers, chips, soda fountain, cream cheese and a full service bar.... They're in much need of a plan. Something about this place feels dirty to me. Not sure if its because it is so unorganized or the fact the bagels bins are hidden away.  Good I'd just okay but over priced. I think I purchased two bagels with strawberry cream chess and that was $12!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite place to go for Brunch after Sunday Mass. Rick was an attentive server."}
{"text":"Having lived in nyc for 5 yrs I've had my fill of bagels.  Not a huge fan but it was often convenient to pick up on my way to work especially when you add the goodies like cream cheese, lox, or make it into a tasty sandwich.    All in all if you are looking for bagels or bialys think these are better than chompies.  They've moved across the street from their old location although i  cant say that i like the new setup either.  what's with all of t he flatscreen tvs? if that's where they spent the $ for improvements i hope they got them from a guy selling electronics from a truck in a parking lot.   they seem to have some sort of identity conflict as to whether they are a deli or a sports bar.   as to the food i've been there for a so-so breakfast and of course had the pastrami and reuben sandwiches both of which were pretty good.  while a little bit traditional deli, note that they were not traditional ny carnegie-sized meat portions considering the sandwiches are close to $10 including a side."}
{"text":"I REALLY wish we had tried out a bagel sandwich or something. I had a corned been plate and the BF had a benedict. We weren't too impressed with either. My friend/neighbor had us get her a bagel sandwich to go and we brought it to her after . . .  and she says it was amazing. So  . . . if I go back, I'll try their namesake and update this review, but it's hard to get an uneventful breakfast out of the back of your mind."}
{"text":"Found you on GROUPON,oh happy day,!! took sister & Nicholas (her 5yr old Grdson, Sister had Tky/Bac, on rye; Boy had PBJ & HM CHIPS,me i downed an  Onion bialy,grilled & White Fish Salad, I'll drive the 20 mi any Wed., P.U. bialys by the dz & a 1# of the wht fish salad; the BEST since Brooklyn..don't get in my way!! Our server (in training)Nick is great,picked my N.Y. attitude in less than a min. LOL ON MY WAY,see ya there,any Wed.!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!!!! I mean terrible!!!! Ordered the matzo ball soup to go and it has absolutely NO flavor!! In fact they put grilled chicken in the broth??? Of course that tells you they don't make the broth (which tasted like soapy water).  Prob worst matzo ball soup I've had, just dumped it out!  Being Jewish, I'm ashamed this place is still in business!!!"}
{"text":"I do like their food. Not the service or prices. Today I ordered 2 bagel breakfast sandwiches with extra bacon. $18.22!! Were there gold bars in the bag I didn't see? Last time eating here! I thought the $12 plus for 2 with regular bacon was a bit much. But $6 more? NO WAY!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever been waiting for bagel and shmear for 20 mins still haven't received it. I've been to all the bagel places in Phoenix it doesn't take this long to toast a bagel and put shmear. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Had never even heard of a bialy before I went here but it was really good. Got a tomato basil bialy with cream cheese and lox. It was really good and a nice filling meal. Probably ate too much but I wanted to finish it was so good.   The bialy is supposed to be healthier than a bagel which is great because i think it tastes better too. The tomato basil packed a ton of flavor. Can't wait till i get back here again."}
{"text":"Bagels are the only decent thing they sell here .. I'm very suprised they didn't get closed down for being filthy in the kitchen and serving spoiled salads . Wow , they have a bar now , big deal . Is this a bagel store or a bar ... Should focus on one thing ."}
{"text":"Great bagels and good food! The bagels are a little small compared to true New York bagels (only reason for not getting 5 stars ) but are tasty and really good! Friendly staff and the restaurant area feels like a New York deli. I'll definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this morning and as usual the service was fantastic! Amanda was courteous and very friendly! Highly suggest grabbing a bite to eat here."}
{"text":"They have the best bialys anywhere, they are so good we pack them in our suitcase when we go back to NYC. Cannot find a decent bialy in NYC anymore since Kossars changed their recipe. NY Bagels in Scottsdale is simply the best."}
{"text":"Not sure exactly where my love for bagels with lox and cream cheese came from. I had a lot of Jewish friends growing up in Tucson so their moms are the likely culprits. Either way, I always missed eating at my favorite Jewish deli in Tempe, Chompies, once I graduated from ASU and left the area (I actually lived right across the street from Chompies my junior year). Now and then I'd wander into an Einstein Bagels and bring a mediocre chain-store end to my craving for the day. But it was never really satisfied.  Until, that is, along came New York Bagels, located a whopping 2 minutes from my office. Thank you, Yelpers Kristin and MJ. And thank you MJ especially for educating me on the caloric difference between a bagel and a bialy. Today I opted for the latter with lox and capers and tomato and onions and.... mmm, heaven. I ate it comfortably at a table while reading a community newspaper and educating myself on the unsurprisingly anti-Semitic practices of the Soviet Union post-World War II. The Jewish guy within my multicultural personality disorder is back in business, and he's happy. Toda!"}
{"text":"I spent 7 days in Arizona and the meal I had here turned out to be infinitely better than the $40 steaks we had at a lodge by the Grand Canyon.    Although it was a bit of a wait, I could not have been happier with my meal.  I had one of the hot corned beef sandwiches with a side of wedge fries.  It was such a simple dinner, but packed with flavor and super lean meat.  Very little fat.  Our server was kind and attentive as well.    My mother ordered the Cobb salad which she literally said was the best salad she ever had.  The potato pancakes and matzo ball soup were also good.   For dessert we stopped by the pastry counter and got some cookies and an eclair.  They were delicious and we finished them as soon as we got back to the hotel.    5 stars because the food was so simple and done so right.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the New Yorker, Corned Beef and Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw & Russian dressing on Rye bread.  Good.  I opted for a side of Home Fries, which were definitely fresh cut because that's definitely how they taste when I make them at home.  Good food.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This is a cozy and delicious place to sit and enjoy a bagel or breakfast and the coffee is great. The people here are really nice and they know what good service is about!"}
{"text":"Great bagels! Food is always good. Nothing blows me away but what they do they do well. Service is always great. Enjoy coming here"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the service. The open face bagel and lox is a treat. Server Nick is PHENOMENAL. We special order from him and he always gets it right. Great attitude!"}
{"text":"Ok so I am totally biased since I grew up in ny/nj area with tons of bagels. We had the everything bagels one with lox and one with egg, cheese, and bacon. First, the place looks like the bagel joints back home and everything is pretty classic. The flavoring on the everything is spot on, seasoning on both sides. I kind of felt that the inside wasn't chewy enough? I'm kind of used to a chewy huge bagel. Overall, it hit the spot but wasn't exactly like home."}
{"text":"Best bialys in town - authentic and delicious! Love the mini onion bialys and my grandchildren love the plain."}
{"text":"So glad to be back in Scottsdale and have some of the awesome bagels and bialys here.  They are JUST LIKE back home (Boston).  The onion Bialy is off the chart , garlic bagel same, salt bagel ..same....I could go on and on - I wish there was a place like this in Seattle that could make it feel like I Was back on the east coast."}
{"text":"Bagel was excellent. Very close to NYC quality. They don't pack on the lox as much as hoped for, so go for the double dose for $2 extra. The service is professional though our server had either allergies or a cold which always freaks me out... Definitely a place worth returning to."}
{"text":"We just love this place.  Great friendly place with good consistent food.  Bagels and lox are incredible. One of our favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast.  Lots of parking. Place was very clean.  Service great.  Lots of options  for breakfast with bagels."}
{"text":"Best bagels and Bialys in all of Scottsdale.it kinda is a half assed operation. But the people there are lovely, if somewhat confused. It needs a real remodel and cleanup. Not somewhere to dine-in."}
{"text":"Sorry this place was not impressive.  I was starving and came in based on Yelp reviews. Order a few sandwiches and a few bagels.    I waited forever for them to make the sandwiches (no one else in the joint).  I was super excited due to the length of time to prepare the sandwiches that that would be spectacular.  Wrong!! Drove home.  Pulled out the food. The bagels were fine.  My sandwich was a joke - I actually thought they were playing a joke with me (maybe they were??).  It was two pieces of bread with cream cheese on one side and a clump of meat in the middle.  The other sandwich was just meat and a slice of cheese with nothing on the bread.   When I placed my ordered. I told the gal taking my order that it was my first time at the place and I wanted to be sure the sandwiches came with lettuce and tomatoes? I was told YES by the gal at the register.    The prices were extremely high as well."}
{"text":"Patty was wonderful to us! She made sure everyone in my family was satisfied with the order and was doing drink refills before the drink was finished. We loved our lunch and service!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had !  After my order was made wrong , the girl at that counter proceeded to deconstruct my sandwich at the counter not only is it wrong but it's disgusting As the owner /Manager stood there not saying a word"}
{"text":"mmm mmm good!  My honey took me here a few weeks ago to have my first bialy experience.  LOVE it and can't wati to go back.  My whole bfast of eggs, potatos, and the \"everything\" bialy was worth writing home about.    The staff was super friendly and the environment is warm and comfortable.  I assume its a family run business which makes the experience that much more enjoyable.    Make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.....had a wonderful French Dip w/ the best deli-style cole slaw I've had in yrs !  This place takes me back to my Long Island roots , where we practically lived at the deli....fully intend to take my wife back there for Sun. brunch. ( also brought home some macaroons .....my wife loved 'em )."}
{"text":"We came here today because all the other brunch places in the area had a huge wave and we saw this place and walked in! Julie was server and took great care of us. This place is delicious, comfortable, it's big and spacious inside, there are lots of good choices, and the bagels are fresh! We got the lox bagel and it was SO good! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've  been  to  this  restaurant  a handful  of times  and  I  have  been  treated  well  by the  staff  while  I  was  there. I  appreciate  the  promptness  of  one  of  their  associates  by the  name  of Megan...she  took  my  order  in a timely  manner  and  followed  up  during  my  lunch, she  did  her  job  very  well  and  I  hope  that  she  gets  recognized for  her  customer  service!! Thanks"}
{"text":"$2.82 for a bagel with plain cream cheese & rude waitress  - Thank you New York Bagel! You just gave me the perfect excuse to save my wallet and my waistline!!!............. or maybe I'll go to Basha's for $1.20 for just as good a bagel & down home smile & friendly service"}
{"text":"I wouldn't dare compare any of our delis in the Valley to those you'll find in New York.  Hell, the delis we have in Arizona don't even come close to the delis I group up going to in Detroit.  But, I've recently become very fond of New York Bagels 'N Bialys.    Not only do they have close to four dozen different varieties of bagels and bialys, but they have history... they've been around since 1987; they have fabulous service (thanks to Angela, who was my waitress the last two visits), they are kid friendly, ad they make a good bagel with lox and omelette.  They also have a check-in offer on the yelp app... check it out!  I'm sure I'll be back to visit NYBNB soon... as a matter of fact, I already have a date planned with friends to return again during Passover.  Matzoh Brie, here I come!  One last thing: the prices here may be higher than what you'll find elsewhere, but I do think the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Rick took great care of us. The food was phenomenal. I love bagels and it's really hard to find a great place that isn't a chain.   This place is great for the whole family or anyone who loves bagels. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the only reason for the second star is because the bagels are fairly legit New York style bagels.  Had we come to the counter for just bagels and left I may have written a different review.  And I've only written one other Yelp review before.  That's how badly I need to counteract the positive reviews on here.  We were seated promptly because there were only 2 other people in the restaurant despite having 6 nosey employees roaming around including a bartender at 1030 am on a Monday.  Maybe there was a lunch rush coming? Not sure based on our experience.  The waiter was nice but had no clue about a single menu item.  And someone there decided to give these poor people tablets to carry around.  There is a reason good restaurants don't carry around computers.  He fumbled through my questions and the tablet like a long drawn out B movie.  I could barely help from rolling my eyes but I felt bad for the guy that management though tablets were a good idea.  The food came very quickly.  Like super fast probably because no one else was there.  I ordered a Spanish omelet that was  supposed to come with salsa. It was a joke.  Luke warm with a few peppers and onions and a square of melted cheese just plopped on top and probably put under a warmer.  *I'll post a photo!*  There was no salsa therefore nothing Spanish about it.  The potatoes were ok but also not hot.  Probably from a warmer.  My boyfriend ordered standard scrambled eggs and sausage and was relatively happy but he also laughed at my sad omelet.    Then a waiter came over and said to him (boyfriend) at his empty plate, \"guess you hated it.  Don't know how we keep the doors open here. Hahaha.\"  But apparently  he didn't look at my plate.  I wasn't hungry enough to finish my joke plate.  BUT the bagel was good and came as a side with the meal.  I have a feeling the waiter overheard us talking about the horrible choice we made for breakfast and tried to be funny.  He's another reason I wrote this review.  Our poor waiter was sweet but clueless.  This place is odd and sad and I don't recommend anyone go there unless they need a quick bagel but there are plenty of bagel places around."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 sandwich (tuna on a bagel) and soup (chicken noodle) combo for delivery. The sandwich was stink and gross. I am unable to describe, but it turned my stomach. I ordered the onion rings (instead of the fruit salad since the fruit had an upcharge). After my food is delivered, I get a text telling me to check my email. In the email, I was informed that they were charging me extra ($3) for ordering onion rings. Which, by the way, were soggy, greasy, inedible and packed into a plastic container clearly not meant for onion rings.   Did I mention that I was charged extra AFTER the food arrived?   The chicken noodle soup tasted delicious and fresh and it's the only reason that they didn't just get 1 star. Oh...and they didn't bring any silverware (or napkins), so I just consumed the soup as though it was a drink and used some chopsticks I had on hand for the veggies and noodles.   I will not order from NYBnB again. Maybe it's better if you dine in, but I'll never find out."}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially for breakfast. They have the best corn beef hash I have had anywhere and they make their own bagels. The service is amazing and always cheerful"}
{"text":"The bagels and bialys were excellent though a bit small. Maybe I just remember them bigger when I was a kid in Brooklyn.   I was really looking for a Jewish bakery.  Their challah seemed just ok.  It had a very yellow color that looked artificial."}
{"text":"Great place to get a fluffy, real bagel. I got the lox and cream cheese and it did not disappoint. The everything bagel was so fresh. Really great service as well, very friendly. They also specialize in bialys, which are just \"healthier\" bagels.... Not quite as fluffy. Nice little place!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and rave about it but I will never go there again. I will save you the time of having to read the full play by play of my last two experiences there, but suffice it to say that it was a deal breaker. I'd complained about the food, and the manager came out NOT to apologize or ask how she could fix it, but to get in my face about it and tell me that I was actually wrong because that is \"how the dish is\" (?). A dish I have probably eaten there over a dozen times.   There are a couple of good servers but the service has always been average overall, but I forgave it because the food was good. But now that the food has also gone downhill, I am done. I have two other bagels spots nearby that are now better food and better service by comparison."}
{"text":"My father-in-law turned us onto this place. It's the most authentic NY bagel you will find"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! I like to get the triple decker add avocado and a side of Russian dressing. The staff is friendly, the homemade bagels are divine. Mike the waiter is super friendly, we look forward to seeing him. It's fun to hear the laughter coming from the ladies playing rummy in small groups. Joe loves the homemade chicken noodle soup! It's as New York a deli one can ask for."}
{"text":"good food and great breakfast selection !  awesome Bialys FRASH !"}
{"text":"Had sit down breakfast twice in the morning before heading into the office. Service was quick enough that we were able to get to the office on time. Staff was extremely friendly, especially the good sir in the kilt. Bialy had a nice crunch and the flavored cream cheeses are creative and all sorts of satisfying to the palate."}
{"text":"Diane and her crew of awesomely friendly waitstaff and crew make you feel like home! The food is always fresh, hot and delicious.    My fav is the pastrami pile up, with potato pancakes, pastrami, sourkraut, cheese and russian dressing. The kids love the chocolate brownies! They are so good and they are huge!  My wife loves the benedict here, with avocado added. The baby loves the mixed fruit and scrambled eggs!  I have to mention how good the bagels are. Just like NY, fresh and chewy. The highlight are the bialys! Great for sammiches or just toasted with some butter.    Go give Diane a hug and enjoy some good food here!"}
{"text":"Over priced, and that goes for everything on the menu. I was not happy with the size or the taste or lack of taste I shoud say. Over cooked bacon, like a little black, avocado that was brown, and not $10 worth of turkey. I did like the rye bread. I  will come back to try the bagels cause what I saw I liked. If your compairing this place to Chompies then my vote is Chompies hands down no contest. Even thou I spen $10 on a sandwich there I always leave happy, full, and sometimes with a doggie bag cause you get your moneys worth and its good enough to want again later. The inside of this place is really big with lots of seating and a bar as well. The staff was nice and the place was very clean. Ill give the bagels a try sometime."}
{"text":"You know it can only be good when the daughter of a Baptist minister owns a Kosher bagel baker. Super friendly, clean, just what we were looking for, a quick good breakfast."}
{"text":"Just the fact that we visited two mornings in a row for breakfast and the bagels should be enough to tell you this place is the real deal.    We were on the hunt for Lox and ran across this place here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  To our surprise, they had more than just bagels and we actually forgot about the Lox and ordered an California omelet, potato pancakes, a blueberry bagel, and an asiago bagel the first morning.  Amazing! The bagels were soft and chewy and oh the potato pancakes...served with just the right amount of apple sauce and sour cream. The next morning we finally remembered the Lox and it was hands down the best we've ever had.  The salmon was fresh and they served it with just amount of veggies, cream cheese, and capers.  We also tried the heavenly hash and it was that, heavenly.  It's house made and not at all greasy.  Ironically we noticed that everyone coming in for counter service was ordering an everything bagel with a smear so we go two of those to go and I'm so happy we did.  We actually didn't eat them until the next morning once we got home and they were amazing; slightly sweet and savory all in one bite.  We can't wait to visit the Scottsdale / Phoenix area again so we can stop in for breakfast again."}
{"text":"First time... I am from New York. Not New York. Daniel the server was the best part of the meal... He was an excellent server. My potatoes were raw. Food presentation was nothing with nothing. Spend 23.00 for breakfast. Go to Fry's buy own ingredients make a better breakfast."}
{"text":"NY Bagles and Bialys is tucked away in a shopping center on the south west side of Scottsdale and Shea (if you pass Cochise heading north you've gone too far).  We stopped in one Sunday morning for some breakfast.   I was told not to expect too much personality from the waitstaff, but our waiter seemed really cool.  He stopped to chat with us for a few minutes between refilling coffee and delivering our plates. Speaking of coffee...I LOVE the brew NYB&B serves!  Mmmmmm.   I had the veggie egg white omelette with salsa on the side.  While they didn't skimp on veggies or egg whites, it was thrown together rather hastily and the salsa was reminiscent of ketchup.  The best part of my meal was the whole wheat bialy (which has fewer cals than a bagel because it's only baked--not boiled and baked like a bagel).   My companion had chocolate chip pancakes. A little doughy for his taste, but I found them addicting...akin to the temptation to eat raw cake batter.  I liked them...  I'll come back even if it's just for a cup of coffee. The on-site bakery was cooking up some pretty scrumptious goods, something to keep in mind for the future."}
{"text":"Gonna give it another shot.  It was a Tuesday morning.  I got up late and was running waaaaay behind schedule.  I needed something quick to eat on the way to a morning meeting, so pulled up the handy Yelp mobile app and found this spot just a stone's throw away.    I walked in and the first thing that hits me is: \"What the hell is a 'bialy?'\"  Fortunately, an employee was there to help me understand that a bialy is baked and a bagel is boiled.  So: it's the texture, not the stuffing.  I decide to get one of each toasted with no spreads.    I think I spent less than $1.50, but I don't remember the exact amount.  Regardless, it was a small price to pay for some delicious culinary research.  In my ever so humble opinion, I like the texture of bagels compared to the bialy.  Taste-wise, they were both much yummier than that nationwide chain you always see on every corner.  I only went here to grab a quick breakfast, but they have different options that I would love to come back for and give another shot."}
{"text":"Hands down-Best bagels in town!!  My hubby is from NY so he knows his bagels. Friendly staff- Meghan was great!!"}
{"text":"Patty was our server and SO nice! She made sure my glass was always full and the food was GREAT! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Walked in this place and ordered an bagel, with salmon and all the fixings. $9 bucks! .......well worth it. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I just rediscovered Bagels N Bialys.  (Took my sons to the original location for years and then just lost touch when they moved....which has been a while.)  All I can say now is why would I have breakfast anywhere else?  The corned beef hash is amazing, the omelettes perfectly made, and the French toast is heavenly.   Service has been very good and the pricing is reasonable for the substantial portions and quality you get.   A neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"worst service I've ever encountered. food isn't bad but would never recommend this place due to the disorganized staff and the insanely long waits for everything."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Felicia was fantastic, super personable and prompt. Would definitely recommend in the future and direct any future diners to Felicia's table"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Best Bagels in the Valley!  Awesome Cream cheese. My kids love the variety and it's nice that they can experience legitimate bagels unlike the chains."}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague.  Tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye, not steamed. The bread was more like a cracker, not soft fresh bread.  The pastrami was served cold.  I guess I should have known better when the server asked if  I wanted lettuce on my pastrami.   The server was brand new and just did not know... Oh well I'm sure the bagels are ok."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing. Everyone is very kind. Daniel our server was very attentive and we were also visited by a couple other incredibly nice employees as well. The good came out very quickly and they always have great discounts!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite. Enjoyed the \"Bialy\" egg sandwiches and bagels. Yum! The service was great too! Emily was our server and did a great job even though she is brand-new."}
{"text":"Had a great meal! Our server, Daniel,  was extremely helpful and nice. I'd recommend this place to anybody!!!"}
{"text":"New York Bagels N' Bialys is one of my go to breakfast spots! That have a solid breakfast menu, they have delicious bagels and they make a killer bloody mary! A must if your looking for some good new york deli fare!"}
{"text":"I saw the ratings, so there was some trepidation, buy I was craving Lox and Bagels. I found out I went to the perfect place. New York Bagels N' Bialys makes there own, I imagine that you can't ruin an egg, but you sure can ruin a Lox and Bagels.   Here, the bagel came in a multitude of ways, regular and open face. I've found open face is easier to eat. I ordered the everything bagel and Nova Lox. It was Felicia the waitress who asked if I wanted it toasted, if I wanted capers and cucumber. She did a great job and was very friendly.   My bagel and lox were great, very tasty and the bagel was exceptional and that's the big difference, but it was Felicia that told me about there Bialys, she said that they were 90 calories as opposed to 300 calories, drat, I'll guess I'll have to go back. I love Bialys too.  Felicia the waitress was exceptional, she brought me back to a time when all my work friends would hang out for breakfast and we had are own personalized waitstaff. It's always great to meet a character.   So the ambiance, the food and the staff reached out and touched me, brought me back to a time in my past. BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to NYBB for 20 years. The best bagels and bialys in Phoenix, delicious sandwiches, and they are super dog friendly. I highly recommend them for breakfast, lunch, and to stock up on their bagels and bialys for home with their day old specials. My dog loves sitting on the patio for weekend breakfasts and the staff always spoils him with a healthy amount of treats"}
{"text":"Surprisingly FAST service for how busy they were on a Friday morning! I had the onion bialy made into an egg & cheese sandwich and everything tasted very fresh and delicious. Will have to go back to try more flavors!!"}
{"text":"The younger girl behind the counter was really friendly despite my indecision about my order. Finally I decided on a garlic bialy with a side of whitefish salad and a soda. It was like... $11 for the total. The small scoop of whitefish salad was $5.95 or something crazy. The bialy and the whitefish were great despite the price."}
{"text":"I like this place overall - MOST of the staff is great and the food is consistently yummy.  I especially enjoy the home fries and their thick bacon slices!  Bloody Mary's are filled with horseradish and kind of pricey IMO at $5-$7, but are nice for a treat every once and a while.  Also, they have great coffee and a dog friendly patio.  If you're trying it out for the first time, get a yelp deal or SOME type of deal, take a leap, and dive into the bagels head first!"}
{"text":"I don't claim to be an expert on bagels, but my grandfather was a Jewish baker in Buffalo...I think we have tried every bagel place in the Phoenix metro area, since moving here 5 years ago.  Without doubt,  these are not only the best, but are perfect!     Absolutely boiled, crunchy on the outside, doughy on the inside --- exactly as a bagel is meant to be.  Breakfasts are fantastic -- my husband loves the deli omelet loaded with deli meats and I go the Greek omelet route, with spinach and feta.  And the breakfast potatoes are to die for.     And should you ever need catering, Bagels 'N Bialys is great to work with.  They'll substitute and help you create exactly what you want.  Ruth, the manager is a doll and her staff is always friendly and customer-service is their mantra!  My only disappointment: they have cut back on their hours.  I hope that is just for the summer."}
{"text":"Bagels, Bialys, black &  white cookies and challah bread! So many bagel options. I have never stayed an ate breakfast but this place seems popular from breakfast/brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"Average bagels, but that's not why they get one star........  The woman behind the counter who helped me, was abrasive and gross.    As I waited for my order, I watched her eat food behind the counter, pick pieces of food out of her mouth with her bare hands, TWICE, then handle someone else's order *with her bare hands*.  Additionally, she was fairly abrasive.   I was going to leave and abandon the order, but I had some extenuating circumstances, so I simply watched her carefully. For my order, thankfully she put on gloves.  Perhaps she noticed that I was watching her (?).  It was stunning to me that someone who works in food service would engage in such blatant unclean behavior.  Surely, this isn't the first time she's behaved like this and what the owner is thinking having such help is beyond me."}
{"text":"No question their bagels are fantastic. HOWEVER, they will screw up your order consistently. Very, very frustrating and we drive out of the way and have been coming here for over 7 years (we followed their change in location). So yes, the fix the problem but they will screw it up again, as expexted. When the problem is butter vs cream cheese, toasted vs not toasted, or a bagel that has jalenpenos in it vs a plain bagel???? How do you screw this up? And then you GIVE ME BACK MY RETURNED ITEM TO KEEP???SERIOUSLY!?  H&H Bagels has come to Tempe so no longer driving out of my way to NYBB. I'll take Big City Bagels or the H&H, thank you!"}
{"text":"First time here, my DH had a breakfast burrito and he really enjoyed it. I had the pile up breakfast which is three potato pancakes, sausage,ham, bacon and cheese sauce and two eggs - it was very delicious .if I ever go back I would definitely order that again .on our way out we bought 4 bagels and cream cheese to take home actually two Bagels & 2 bialy .ironically I was not that impressed with the bagels I felt what we had for breakfast was way better then what the restaurant is known for .but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had they just seem to get very hard within a few hours the service while we ate breakfast was outstanding I believe the lady's name was Nicole she was fabulous and a really great waitress!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. One of the best Rubens I have had! Would recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"My husband had food poisoning from this place! STAY AWAY FROM HERE  I'm from Brooklyn New York and let me tell you this is terrible place. My husband had a bagel with whitefish salad , which in Brooklyn is wonderful. Plus he ordered an egg cream soda. If you're from Brooklyn or New York You  would know what I'm speaking about.  Not even  Two hours after he ate, he was so sick. I won't get into details.  The whitefish salad was horrible, potato pancake was flavorless.   The bagels were stale. They don't know how to make a chocolate egg cream at all. It should be removed from menu. Place was not very clean either.  My Bialy which I was so looking forward too was SO Stale as well.   If you've ever tasted a REAL  bagel or bialy, then you know. Otherwise this place should take the \"New York \" off their sign. It's no where near New York food! A horrible meal that ruined my vacation with food poisoning."}
{"text":"This neighborhood gem has only recently caught my attention, and I am sorry I waited so long to try it for myself! I needed a food donation for a High School event I was helping with, and the owners here jumped in without a moments' hesitation! When I went to pick them up, they had bags and bags of bagels ready, and even added more to the piles before I could make it out the door. I must confess that I ate one on my way to the event venue and that bagel was one of the best I've EVER eaten! I appreciate this restaurant's generosity, community involvement, and the quality of their product. NY Bagel's 'N Bialys are on my list of breakfast spots to try this summer...see you there!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here forever, it's bigger than I expected and was a busy Sunday. I got an everything bagel with cheese and tomato toasted to go. Super fast! I didn't wait that long at all, surprised for how busy it was. The employees that waited on me were helpful and really nice, I believe it's a family owned place. I looked at the menu (it's gigantic!) and thought the prices were a bit too high. My bagel sandwich was perfect,fast and hot. I would come back again for breakfast. Everything looked delicious and pretty large portions."}
{"text":"My server rick was FANTASTIC. Great attitude and fast service :) it was my first time here and I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"NYBB was a happy discovery that I made when I had just moved from the east coast. I stumbled upon it by accident but I remember breathing the biggest sigh of relief when I walked in and it felt like home.  It has a classic NY deli feel, classic Jewish food, Dr. Browns soda, any bagel or bialy that you could imagine, great food, great service, hamentashen, halva, and all the things that make me feel right at home.   I almost never have time to come in these days but just now finding out that they offer delivery through Grub Hub is a game changer. I work just down the street so now I don't have to wait for free time for my comfort food. :)  That being said, I still recommend going in to the restaurant for the full experience. My server, Julie, was particularly great. She was very accommodating and patient while I read through the menu. Each item was so tempting that it made it hard to make a choice!  NY Bagels and Bialys is a must!"}
{"text":"Simply the best turkey Ruben in town.  Gotta love 'yesterday's bagels' which are the best too"}
{"text":"Nicole was awesome!! She recommended the best breakfast..Humble hash. Best corn beef hash I have had! First time here. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to NYB using the coupon from the Entertainment Guide.  We were invited to sit wherever we were most comfy.  Our waiter showed up immediately and was very pleasant. I ordered the Antipasto Salad and my date ordered the French Dip. Both were excellent. We also ordered a dozen bagels to go since it was \"happy hour\". I let our waiter chose the variety and requested the veggie and pumpkin cream cheeses to spread on top. Hubs was skeptical about the pumpkin cream cheese when we got home but he was pleasantly surprised about how yummy it was.  Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 4/5  I am a native east coaster and most of my relatives live in New York and New Jersey, aka, the world's bagel capital. Needless to say, I have spent much of my life devouring great, fantastic, or stupendous bagels. Outside of New York and New Jersey, I have never had a better bagel than at New York Bagels 'N Bialys.   I had high hopes once I saw them marketing bialys. If you have never had a bialy, I strongly urge you to do so. They are delicious and essentially, a more healthy version of a bagel (look it up - less sugar, no boiling, less flour). And boy did they not disappoint. the bagels are flavorful and covered in just the right amount of toppings (seeds/garlic/onion or whatever you like). The pumpernickel is my favorite on the bagel side. The bialys are top-notch as well - with an \"everything\" bialy being the best.   The service also reminds me of New York - for better or worse (I take that to be for the better). Don't be shy when you enter - walk right up to the counter and you will be served ASAP.  The best non-bagel item is the hopple-popple. It is a mixture of eggs, chunks of beef salami, and onions and peppers. It is a hearty and utterly delicious breakfast. The deli sandwiches are fine, but I'd personally stick with the breakfast side of the menu where everything is virtually exceptional. Also, there is no better place to find a variety of smoked fish than here.   My only complaint? The price. I feel like the price constantly goes up and a meal for two can easily get into $30-40, which is expensive for breakfast. I would go there more often if it wasn't such a hit to the bank account. Still, the quality is there, so I am willing to pay the higher price, especially for special occasions. Also, they are very good about offering deals through Yelp or other deal sites, so you can typically find something to mitigate the price. But the important thing is to just sit back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a fresh, hot bagel??? I know I do, and this place has many delicious and varied options. My go to is an ET with veggie cream cheese, sliced tomato and cucumber. Deee-luscious. Wish I'd had time to hit them up for a full breakfast or lunch experience because the menu looked amazing. Maybe next trip!"}
{"text":"Make sure they know if u r in a hurry.  Was disappointed bc I called ahead and gave very specific directions (Please make sure the 3 dozen bialy's are in plastic bags bc I need to pack them in my suitcase.  Unfortunately, they were not and I had to make the taxi wait...  costing me more money.  UGH!  In the long run, it ended up costing $72 for 39 bialys (including taxi)"}
{"text":"omg!! the humble hash eggs Bennie was so good! I will definitely be back! super nice staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely server named Vanessa and a delicious bagel sandwich! Be sure to get the $10 for $20 deal and penny mimosas!!"}
{"text":"This is average. At best, its average bagels, and average bialys. There are so many good bagel places in this country, its hard to review a place like this. First, why so many stupid flavors? Leave that to Panera or the supermarket. Bagels, in a place like this should have about 6-8 varieties. There is no place for chocolate chip or blueberry. That is what cookies and danishes are for. The bagels have an okay taste and texture. The name may say NY, but not NYC, maybe Schoharie? The bialy is not even that good when it is good, so i its not perfect, it fails, and in this case, it just doesn't pass. There is nothing wrong with NY Bagels and Bialys, its just not that great, but for a bagel and cream cheese on a Sunday morning with the NY Times, its okay. The bagels over at Chompie's are actually a little better."}
{"text":"I love New York Bagels and Bialys in Scottsdale! I love the food and the wait staff! It doesn't get much better than eating at New York Bagels and Bialys!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Best bagels in the Valley! If you like great breakfast food without all the pretense you will love it! Servers are friendly, great menu. Order fresh made bagels to take home with you, incredible!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE NYBB!!! The people are wonderful and accommodating, the food is great, and the bagels are the best I've had west of the Mississippi! These are the real deal, and for anyone who knows and loves good bagels, they need to hear over there immediately."}
{"text":"Great place in Scottsdale to go for brunch. They get you a table right away. All the food comes out hot and delicious. Bacon is always cooked to just the right level, and the pancakes are some of the best in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially Zack who was our server the last time we eat at the restaurant. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I wish I hand 1 more hand so I could give this place 3 thumbs down. I make better french toast in my kitchen...I am not sure if they know what vanilla and cinnamon are. The eggs were alright and the bagel was OK as well. Nothing special at all, but I was actually surprised how they were able to make their french toast so tasteless."}
{"text":"We had a party of six for breakfast.  We were promptly met by our server Felicia.  She took all the orders and read each one back to make sure everything was correct.  Felicia explained the difference between bagel and bialy to us and gave us a sample of a bialy....very good!  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"First-time visit for breakfast what an awesome Place great prices good meal and the service was awesome we really enjoyed our waitress Nikki. She gave great recommendations for breakfast and for stuff to go home"}
{"text":"Love this deli and it's walking distance from my place. Lucky me. They serve a great breakfast and lunch with all the traditional classics you'd expect from a NY style deli."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \"sweetie\" and \"honey\"  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.  The food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.  The problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!"}
{"text":"I was very excited because the reviews on yelp looked very good.  Walked in and the place was empty for lunch. I mean the place is pretty big and it was empty.  I ordered the choose two which was a half sandwich and soup.  Let's start with the Matzo ball soup. It came out looking good but was luke-warm and did not taste nearly as good as Chompies Matzo soup. For my other part of the choose two I got the half cheese-steak.  I told them no mushroom and peppers but to keep the onions.  It came out loaded with mushrooms.  The waitress said they were onions.  I told her they were mushrooms and picked them out to show her.  She said sorry and let me get you a new one.  The new one came out and it was dry and the onions were not even grilled well.   The service was slow. Food wasn't hot. I am not sure I will go back.  This place was a disappointment for me."}
{"text":"I grew up in NJ, this place has the best bagels I've encountered since I lived on the east coast. All the food is high quality and HUGE portions - be ready! In love with the lox plate. Great service as well - it's got a nice casual dining room if you want to sit and enjoy a breakfast."}
{"text":"I  won't eat bagels in Phoenix, so I am not here to review them.  I am only here to say that I had dinner there last night and the place is filthy.  The service awful, at best.  The Reuben sandwich small, flat, greasy, not enough dressing.  The partitions between the booths are so high, that you can't see a server and they can't see you.  I had to wave my napkin high over the wall to get noticed.  And it's not like there were any other customers to serve.  A complete waste of time and money."}
{"text":"definitely a great NY deli feel to this little spot.  Inside is quaint, but clean and the service is friendly and fast.  Great for a sit down meal, plu they have a great deli counter to grab stuff to go"}
{"text":"Picked up a dozen bagels & bialys and sampled the corned beef.  Unfortunately the corned beef is at best a good goyashe corned beef, not Kosher or Kosher style.  The bagels and bialys were top notch though.  Great selection.  What's the difference between a bagel and a bialy?  A bagel is boiled before baking, a bialy is not.  Bagels have a chewier hide.  If you enjoy noshing on bagels (or bialys) I recommended getting them here.  It's about 9 bucks for a dozen and they are so much better than anything you'll find at the grocery.  We're talking east coast quality bagels here."}
{"text":"We have tried this spot a few times and each visit we find just enough we like to keep coming back.  The whitefish on bialy is a favorite and the selection of bagels is extensive.  Try an oversized sandwich with a vanilla phosphate... All wonderful.  The only downside is that most items are $10+ and that adds up for a family of 5."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over a year now and it's always been ok.  However, last time I went, they have raised their prices significantly.  Then The waiter came to take our order and we told him to give us a few minutes to decide.  25 minutes later and he never came back, so I won't be back. Too much competition in the restaurant industry to put up with this!  Also the place could use a serious remodel."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite.  There are two types of pastrami in the world, Jewish pastrami and gentile pastrami.  Gentile pastrami is less fatty and less tangy, and more resembles general cold cuts.  This was gentile pastrami.  It was, however, very high quality for gentile pastrami.  The matzo ball soup was good."}
{"text":"It's a great low-key breakfast spot. As an east coast girl, I have high expectations for bagels. NYBB bagels are ALWAYS super fresh and they have an amazing variety of flavors. It's a bit pricey for what the menu offers (about $9 for an omelette) but it's worth it because everything is fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"OK food but not worth another try.  My daughter and I tried to like this place as we are from Long Island and it is convenient to our home. Daughter Heidi ordered a bagel and it came with a small portion of cream cheese so I ordered another side of the cream cheese.  They charged a ridiculous amount for the side and when we talked to the manager he was arrogant, aloof and obnoxious telling us that was it he was not going to do anything in our favor.  The cost of the side was actually more than the bagel.  There are plenty of choices in Scottsdale and I don't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a native New Yorker with a love of Jewish deli food, and this made me think of home.  They have a great selection of both bagels and bialys, and gave me an extra flavor to try since they were out of a few that I wanted to try.  The eggs were light and fluffy.  The coffee was great.  There are several things on the menu that I need to go back and try.  The only thing I would change is not to have them bag up the bagels so quickly in the early afternoon so I could get a chance to try more of them individually."}
{"text":"Been here a lot lately.  The \"egg-a-bagel\" combo is a screaming deal for breakfast! Their omelettes are big and fluffy, and their baked goodies look fantastic.  Their soup and sandwiches for lunch are all top quality and really fresh.   Great staff and service, plus it also has a true deli feel to it. It's always busy too, which is a great sign."}
{"text":"I grew up in Brooklyn and now live in California. Every time I go to Scottsdale I load up on the only bialys that are like those in NYC. They are the best. Last time I bought 4 dozen Bialys and 3 dozen bagels. When I got home I cut them in half and froze them. I love this place."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I'm always yearning for a good deli experience in the desert. After all, my people wandered around one for 40 years. You'd think we could find a decent nosh!! Anyway, this place ain't it. As pathetic as it sounds, I still can't find anything better than Chompies, and that's a pretty low bar to cross.   My wife and I took 4 of our 5 kids (oldest at UofA) and we were hopeful for a taste of NYC as we had been here for breakfast once before and it was decent. Our lunch experience was far from it.   I had the special - a skirt steak sandwich. My wife had a half chopped liver sandwich and a cup of soup (can't recall which one). Kids had bagels.   Portions were ridiculously small. There were 4 strips of steak on my bread. My wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver. Bagels were large, but nothing special. Service was prompt, but devoid of personality. Come on, if you're gonna work at a deli at least give me a little attitude!   Anyway, if you're Jonesing for deli, avoid this place. It won't help."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, Dominique was super friendly and fun to talk to! Food is great and the mimosas Are tasty!"}
{"text":"Dad & I (and my brother, when he's in town) are regulars on Saturdays.  NYBB serves food that makes us happy.   We are always greeted with big smiles.  It feels like home.  Over the past weeks, we've had the pleasure of being served by Nick.  He's one of the best waiters I've ever encountered.  Nick has a wonderful personality.  Always smiling and very friendly.  Nick understands hospitality.  He tries to make each of us happy and goes out of his way to do so.    NYBB really lucked out when they hired him.  We luck out whenever he's our waiter. See you next week!"}
{"text":"Truly on of the best Jewish delis in the valley.  The bagels and bialys remind me of the ones I used to get as a boy growing up in NYC.  Its family run and the staff is veey friendly, efficient and helpful.  My wife and I had lunch (a Reuben and a fish platter and our kids ate breakfast egg on a bagel and a huge portion of kids french toast for the price we actually had to take some home) We loved it.  Very pleasant experience.  The owners son actually waited on us,  adding to the family atmosphere. He was very helpful explaining to my wife what bialys were.  Our food was out within 5min of us ordering us and he was very attentive.   Checking in on us every few minutes.  They even suggested they we come back on a Wednesday since you get a free 6 bagels with every dozen you buy.  One of the best breakfast experiences we have had in years. Highly recommend to people who like traditional jewish food...although its not completely kosher a large portion of the food is.  We'll be back and probably bring some of our gentile friends so they can learn what a REAL bagel is"}
{"text":"Kari is awesome. Best mimosa around. The food is unique and tasty and they are open most Holidays."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New Jersey so finding good bagels was very hard to do, but couldn't be happier that I found this place. The food is great and the staff are always extremely personable and friendly!"}
{"text":"I like local places and try to support mom & pop places - particularly good ones that aren't on everyone's radar screen. This is one of those places.   Hidden in the back of a strip mall and larger and nicer inside than it appears from the outside.  Don't let the name or location dissuade you.   Started as a bagel shop supplying over 6,000 bagels per day to local resalers and then opened (I would call it) a diner serving bfast and lunch here in 2005.   Great food and friendly service. Prices are reasonable. Open until about 3pm depending on the day. Some get Yelp specials as well. Patty works the weekends and was a great server.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, tasty bagels, great lox...reasonable prices..it wasn't a bad day to sit outside either. Very friendly and efficient staff. Thank you Kim!"}
{"text":"Just got out of Rosh Hashanah services and ready for something to eat. Thought NY Deli would hit the spot. So sorry we chose NY B'N B. We give our order and the bread is soggy. Why? Because they washed the dishes but didn't make sure they were dry before putting the bread on the plate. The chicken soup was so salty we couldn't eat it. The Knish was greasy, and the pastrami was definitely not NY Pastrami. If you're from NY you know what I'm talking about. We eat as much as we can stomach and decide rather than wasting the food we would take it home. Don't know why. The waitress brings us two huge takeout containers for a half a sandwich and nothing for the soup. I question if I was to pour the soup into one of the sandwich containers and she stares at me and then asked if I want a container for the soup. I make a sigh. She comes back with a small container meant for cream cheese spread. Even I can see this isn't going to work, but I try. I was right. Between soggy bread, over salted soup, Pastrami no self respecting New Yorker would dare serve, and a waitress that seemed to need a lot more training, we left feeling sad for the experience. If you want a really good Deli that truly honors NY, go to Scott's Generations on 7st and Glendale Ave. But as for NY B'NB, forget about it!!"}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast this morning.  Food was good except for the overripe fruit. Which I sent back.  Waiter was fantastic. Jimmy the host is always a gentleman.  I have a big problem with the loud mouth red head  Sherry. Ruth is off in her own little world.  There were 2 new guys that just started training today. We observed them in the food well with NO gloves on. One was reaching in his pocket to get his cell phone with a glove on.  That glove should of been removed, hands washed and re gloved.   We mentioned this to the Red Head and she came back with some snotty comment.   This is not the first time. We mentioned our concern to Ruth the last time.    My Husband is in the food service industry and works very close with the board of health.    As reading all the reviews this place is going downhill. What a shame.  Our New Years Resolution is to not dine at this establishment anymore.    Shelly is awesome but she can't do it all.  Things haven't been the same since Rich retired and one of the head waitresses left after 8 years.   This says it all."}
{"text":"Great staff and fantastic food. I go for the Hopple popple most visits. Yummy!! Love the bialys."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars...I wish I could give more! My daughter and I came here for my birthday breakfast today. We were greeted with very friendly faces, especially our server, Felicia! I had seen the reviews on yelp last night while searching for Jewish deli's. I was first intrigued by the challah bread French toast but couldn't decide on just that, so we ordered 4 or 5 different plates! Needless to say we left with very happy tummies and hearts. Felicia even set us up with a very yummy desert for my birthday, topped with candles and all! She even had me try their delicious coconut macaroon, which was so sweet and delicate it melted in your mouth. Thanks for making my birthday so special you guys!!"}
{"text":"At one point I gave this place 4 stars due to \"overpriced\" lox in my opinion, which is one of my favorites. After trying a more local place on a non-work day, that particular place's lox (same price) was White Castle-like bite-size. The only place I found lox cheaper was a large chain restaurant (let's just say), although thinking about it now it was on promotional sale.   I now give the crown officially to NYBB for their fair prices, great staff, and nice ambience. Best local bagel place and I got to try and enjoy my first Bialy here (I've only heard of them growing up in NY originally). I haven't drank here as I only stop by on the way to work so this review is based off of pre 10am experiences."}
{"text":"I was really happy with my meal. The service was wonderful. I had a gift card so I ordered a few items to sample.  Ruben sandwich....great sandwich.  Nothing wrong with it. Nothing exceptional about it either though. Matzo ball soup.... really good and the noodles tasted like butter which was really something special.  Bagels and bialys.....now I really don't want to take anything away from them here because based on other people's reviews there is a big difference between a bagel you get at Einstein Bros and a legit NY bagel.....personally, I haven't met a fresh bagel I didn't like and without having the competition right next to it for the sake of comparison....I can't tell the difference. It was a good bagel and the strawberry cream cheese was homemade which was unique and delicious. I'd never heard of a bialy which is similar to a bagel except it's not boiled like a bagel,  doesn't have a hole,  and is slimmer. I didn't care for the taste or texture of the bialy. It was salty and it was cinnamon raisin. I cut it in half, the top half was light and fluffy and the bottom was so tough I could barely bite off a knock to gnaw on. If I lived close to it, I'd go there for lunch or breakfast often to support a local mom n pop, but it wasn't so great that I'd cheat on the local businesses here in Gilbert and drive to Scottsdale to visit them."}
{"text":"Really?!?  You see my husband walk up at 3:00pm on the dot...look him in the eye and lock the door??  Wow, rude!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's been a go-to everytime I'm in the valley. Best bagels and awesome deli coffee. Our server Amanda was great. Bonus: they're dog friendly! Brought our pups treats and water!"}
{"text":"This has usually been go-to for take out bagels and bialys (onion bialy, my weekend treat) and rarely for a meal.  But on this Fathers Day, with my own kids out of town, I wanted Baked Salmon, a childhood treat. It was perfect. Had an appetizer size plate, which was plenty of food and so nicely moist. Came with the proper veggies and an onion bagel. My wife had the matzoh ball soup (which needed no extra sal or pepper) and wonderfully lean pastrami. Rachelle took such great care of us; she's obviously  used to detailed orders from folks. Think Harry and Sally and you know that a server who can do that cheerfully is a treasure. I can see more Baked Salmon there in my future."}
{"text":"Don't go to NYBB! The staff is is incompetent & lazy. Told the counter person I had never been there before. They literally walked away without saying anything. They didn't offer any suggestions/help/explanations. My order was wrong when I got it. Because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting. NYBB is extremely overpriced. Do not go to NYBB!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and I am blown away by the exceptional customer service and bagels. We tried a sausage egg and cheese sandwich on a jalapeño bagel and a sesame bialy. The bagel was what I envision eating a bagel in NY would be like and the bialy was equally as impressive. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I really don't think these bagels taste like NY bagels at all. And the bialys taste like... whatever bialys taste like. Sorry, but these aren't' the real deal to me. I tried them over several months and just couldn't get used to them."}
{"text":"My new favorite place is Scottsdale! I stopped in this morning for a bagel sandwich. They had exactly what I wanted and the entire experience was exceptional. Upon entering, you are greeted by a friendly worker who either takes your order or seats you. My server, Vanessa, was exceptional. She took my coffee order right away and returned promptly with coffee in hand. After taking my order, the was attentive but not over-bearing; very efficient and friendly. The food was great. I had the egg-a-bagel with pepper jack cheese and bacon. Also, USE THE YELP CHECK-IN OFFER FOR A $0.01 MIMOSA! What a great deal! You'll see how big the drink is in the photo. All in all, a great experience and I am so glad I decided to try NYBB out for the first time!"}
{"text":"This is where I buy bialys when I need them (best ones in phx)...  and I pop in here sometimes to have lunch.  They have great sandwiches and salads.  Free wifi makes it an ideal place to work while I'm grabbing lunch too.  Their coffee is also pretty good...  with bottomless refills!    It's easy, quick and delicious."}
{"text":"They do a decent job of Arizona imitation of a New York Deli. Good selection of foods on their menu and they serve breakfast all day long. It has been here for many years. Sometimes when eating in the restaurant the service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"My family and I are vacationing here from California and we really did not know where to eat and this place popped up. We ordered a pile up, breakfast burrito, egg-a-bagel pile up, and a humble hash. Would recommend any of them. Service was excellent, friendly, and attentive. Food came out quickly and hot. The next time we come to Arizona we will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Just great!! I loved it. The spinach salad had so many walnuts and craisins and the raspberry vinaigrette was bomb!! We also shared the ruben which was spot on!! Nice, lean pastrami, crispy kraut and russian. They dont have sourdough so the guy behind the counter suggested marble rye and some house mustard. Man, was that great!! The fries were crispy and hot....eve. though we got our stuff to go. The matzo ball soup had fantastic flavor but I didn't like the chicken. (Nothing wrong with it, I prefer white meat and it was chewy dark) . The guy behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice. I think he's the owners son because a girl came in for an interview and he called his mom right then so I'm assuming but either way...he was knowledgeable, friendly and kind to the rest of the staff, even speaking to them in Spanish. I loved it and I'll have to make up a reason to go back to north Scottsdale! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Coffee was great. Our server, Merrick, did a great job. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that if you haven't gone, you're missing out. The wait staff is super nice and will be patient with you, and remember your face. I used to travel 20 miles just to pick me up a bagel.  I haven't been in quite some time, and am VERY eager to visit the new location (even better since it's closer to my home!). A bar? Are you kidding me? I'm IN.  Their bagels are fresh, huge, and delicious. Made right there in the shop. Ah-mazing. Tons better than you would receive from any Einsteins hands down.  Edit:  After reading their new menu, this company has -grown- since my last visit."}
{"text":"Found this amazing place on yelp, and oh my goodness is it delicious! The service was great and the food was outstanding, I recommend the Lox platter and the bloody Mary's! We will be coming back for sure, the owners are super nice and told us about the history of the location! Love love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal authentic new York style. Wish they still did dinner hours but just have to make it work. Best bagels around."}
{"text":"If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious bagel made the way they should be.  My everything bagel had just that - everything.  The schmear was perfect size so i didn't feel i wasting it.  The hubby's Southwest Benedict was huge and his lox platter more than ample.   For checking in on Yelp I got a 1 cent mimosa which went well with the good hot coffee.  A jewel."}
{"text":"Got bagels and coffee to go this morning and was very disappointed. For a breakfast place their coffee is awful and they don't even have real half and half out or the right cups for iced coffee. They also do not have stevia or raw sugar.. They need to get an update on this bandwagon. I'll give it to them that their bagels are fresh but our bagel sandwich was half heartily put together. It was dry and they did not get either orders right I asked for a jalapeño bagel and got plain and I asked for pepper jack cheese and got cheddar.. Needless to say I will find a different place to get bagels and coffee."}
