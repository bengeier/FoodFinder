{"text":"Food was delicious. Our server was very attentive. I highly recommend this place especially if you like Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place reopened a few months back under new management.  Have ordered sushi from there a few times as I live only a few blocks away.  Very good."}
{"text":"Wow, the sushi and the service is the best, I am soooo glad to have my very first Vegas meal here!!! The dishes are very fresh and looks pretty, just like a piece of art~"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, but terrible location for their business!  FOOD: Everything on their menu is made to order and taste fresh. I highly recommend getting the Salmon Sushi Pizza! It is my favorite item at this restaurant! The sushi lunch combo is always a great option when you are in the mood for sushi. It come with assorted nigiri and one roll. Everything tasted great, but everything takes a long time to prepare. I didn't mind waiting because every sushi piece was made with care, but if you're in a rush, I wouldn't recommend ordering sushi. They also offer hibachi and teriyaki dishes.  ATMOSPHERE: It's a cute and small restaurant. Unfortunately, it's located in a dead shopping center. Waiter was nice. Great place to get food for take out."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small restaurant, but everything is very clean and well put together. The workers/owner are all very nice and offered us waters as we waited for our order. We ordered to go and we didn't have to wait long. The way they pack the food is also organized which makes it easy to carry. The food honestly was awesome! I ordered a katsu and a Tokyo roll for myself. The Tokyo roll tasted as good as it looked (which was amazing by the way). The katsu was also really good. It was crispy and not oily at all. Plus they poked holes into the box lid to make sure that it would stay crispy. My grandmother ordered the pad thai with shrimp, and she was very pleased. She said she likes it because it's not spicy at all (she can't handle spicy food). I think we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sushi,  nice atmosphere with the owner giving the customers great service."}
{"text":"I went in to order take out and I was thoroughly impressed with the service! I ordered California rolls and Philadelphia rolls to go. When I got home and ate them I was again impressed! They were so good! I don't live near the restaurant, but I would defiantly drive there to eat again."}
{"text":"Great little spot , food was great , the owner is there serving.. amazing customer service, the plates presentation was on point  , definitely coming back !!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has closed. Bummer!!! I guess it didn't have the support it needed. What a great place in a bad location."}
{"text":"This spot has 5 stars for a REASON!  Philip (the head-sushi chef) was so gracious and really loves what he does!  He'll just start making you things-you don't even need a menu.  Everything he creates is AMAZING:).  Worth the Uber fare!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Front the moment we walked in, the staff was friendly, made sure we were enjoying our night. The food was delicious, and some of the best sushi I've had in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, couldn't be happier to try this restaurant out. It's within walking distance from my house and I had passed by it several times and finally decided to go in. Couldn't be happier that I did! The sushi was some of the best and their lunch specials are decent. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing hospitality and delicious food!   Ps. The tempura vegetables are to die for!!"}
{"text":"A good sushi place. Japanese food with twist. The hibachi steak/chicken is good. Very nice food presention. I've been here 3x and so far tried most of the chef's special and never been disapointed. Service is excellent. The only negative with this place is the location as it is hiidden. In a way it is good coz no wait for good jap food. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is a fun discovery. The 5 star rating on Yelp cued us to persevere in finding the place. The signage was a bit misleading and we almost gave up. I'm glad we didn't because we were rewarded with a most delightful lunch. I had the salmon teriyaki bento box and my husband had the sashimi lunch. The salad was so fresh, the lettuce had the right amount of crunch. It got even better after that. The teriyaki had the right amount of sweetness.  The service by the owner, Ben, was impeccable. We wished him success."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. They care about their product and it shows. The tuna taco was amazing. The fish melted in my mouth. I would recommend this tiny gem to anyone!"}
{"text":"Come at least once a week, best Katsu. Great service, I feel like family every time I go in. Hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, food was really good. Enjoyed the salmon. The owners are nice and very hospitable"}
{"text":"Another Fab dinner tonight. Brought our son who loves sushi and he too thought it was delicious.  Chef is awesome, so engaging, explains dishes he makes, food is so fresh. Service is exceptional. We absolutely love that they're in our neighborhood. Bringing our friends next time!!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating a most wonderful lunch here!! The food was delicious and beautifully presented. The service was amazing! The guys working were friendly and told us about all the different items on the menu. Can't wait to go back! Everyone needs to try this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family and we loved it . Cool, clean little spot tucked away in a small upcoming business park.  Ben, the owner, was very kind and welcoming as he sent us a taster of their veggie tempura as we looked over the menu. Food was very visually appealing and tasted great. Give this new spot a try, you won't be disappointed  Great lunch specials at a good prices We'll be back"}
{"text":"The location is kind of weird. It is tuck away in the back. It is right in between the cross fit place and the dry cleaners. When you walk inside, the atmosphere feels very relax. The music they play is very calming. The service is amazing. The waiter would always check up on us and make sure everything is ok.   We order the squid for appetizers. It was big. It was a whole small squid. It was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce they had complimented the squid really well. It is a must try. We also got a salad and miso soup with our lunch special. The salad is fresh and crisps. The waiter also gave us vegetable tempura to try and it was perfectly fried. Not to oily but crispy.   2 sushi roll lunch special: Sweet potato sushi and salmon avocado. The sweet potato is tempura and then made into a sushi. It is delicious and I can eat this everyday!  The salmon avocado was good. A good balance of salmon and avocado and it was fresh.  We also ordered the steak teriyaki lunch special and hibachi lunch special. Fried rice is $2 more but GET IT! It is worth it! They asked how we want teriyaki and hibachi steak was cooked. We wanted medium well and it was cooked perfectly. Their to go boxes are cute as well!   We order to much food because we was full after the sushi and squid. But it was so worth it. Everything is fresh and delicious. Even though we ate a lot, I do not feel heavy which is nice because I can continue on with my day without a nap. The service is on point. They are all very sweet and amazing. We will definitely come back and bring the rest of the family. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food, great price, always a pleasure eating here, and always left full and satisfied. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best sushi restaurants I've had in Vegas. The food is always delicious and the owner is extremely welcoming and friendly. The teriyaki chicken and chicken Katy's lunch specials are delicious and comes with so much food! I also really loved the cucumber salad. I will definitely continue to come back and can't wait to try all the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  I got the lunch special sashimi which was excellent!  Great portion and a nice price around $12, comes with soup and salad.    Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A few days ago, my mom and I wanted sushi so we decided to come try this place since its closer to us. The staff/cooks are amazing and very hospitable. The server made sure our drinks are filled and service is amazingly fast. My most favorite dish is the  White Tuna Ceviche, I would eat a pound of it. Most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from a friend. The location? is hidden in the middle of a residential area so it is not on a main Street. You would think you were on your way to a friend's house instead of a great restaurant!  I went here with my daughter on Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner. My daughter ordered the miso soup, edamame and yellowtail sushi. I ordered the yellowtail scallion roll and sushi sampler. They gave us a small appetizer of thier vegetable fritter and a cucumber and crab salad/pickled dish. Everything was delicious and the service was great!  I know that posting a great review is a catch 22. The place was empty when my daughter and I ate there on Saturday. I want them to be successful and I know that with that means that they will get busy and I may have to wait awhile for the delicious food to get in my belly!   Honestly though, I hope they do well as this really is a gem of a place. The chef and staff care about the food they produce and provide to thier customers. This will not be my last visit here and if you haven't been here yet you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow i love the food perfect. Love this place. Japanese restaurant near me. Quite neighborhood too."}
{"text":"This place was so good!! The salmon pizza and the tuna tacos were delicious, highly recommend it. It really lives up to the reviews on here. The only complaint I have is the location. It's so hidden and odd. But other than that, this place is so lovely and satisfying if you're thinking about trying it you TOTALLY should :)"}
{"text":"There are a lot of sushi places in this town, but this one is definitely unique. The chef is extremely talented! The dishes he made were beautifully designed, and the taste was amazing. The sushi is very fresh and made with delicious sauces that I have never experienced before. Very cozy and intimate interior. The pricing is fair for what you get. If you are looking for unique sushi experience, definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and flyer for restaurant was it, so I thought we'd  try it. So glad I did. Restaurant was clean, staff was very friendly and most off food was amazing!!"}
