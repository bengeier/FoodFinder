{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the North Hills by far. Really good food. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Emiliano's is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the North Hills. The service is always good and food comes out quickly. It is actual legitimate Mexican food, unlike Mad Mex. The margaritas and sangria is always good. It is never really busy but let that fool how good the food is!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten in.  The food was terrible and the service worse.  Avoid this place like the plague, lest you contract it here.  Rumor has it this place is owned by the same people who own The Great Wall Chinese restaurant.  Patron Mexican Restaurant in Wexford and Mad Mex are much better, and the servers understand English."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We come here often. It is a fantastic place to have good old Mexican food. In a rush? The taco salad is perfect. To your table in minutes. Get it with desebrada.  The daily special are always great. Extensive menu. Great staff!  They have recently converted the first floor side dining room into a new bar room.  This space can be quite noisy and the service is not quite a good as it is in the main dining room, particularly when the bar is busy.  If you want a calmer experience, ask to be seated elsewhere.  They are very accommodating."}
{"text":"While I have had Mexican food in both SoCal and Mexico, I won't act like the pretentious snobs who rated this place 2 stars.   Is it as good as you'd get in the Southwestern US?  No. But this is Pittsburgh!  The chips and salsa are always delicious. The guacamole bowl, made fresh at your table is delicious, albeit slightly overpriced at 8 or 9 dollars.   I tend to get the same few things here.... The enchiladas- always delicious. The fajitas- not the greatest I've had (in Pittsburgh) but good. Especially the shrimp. And their new(er) tacos. I typically get the carnitas.   Overall, the service is solid and the food is good. The red sangria is awesome, but the margaritas are just OK.   If you are a snob about Mexican food, go to California. If you like good Mexican food in Pittsburgh, this is the place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Emiliano's last night for the first time and had a great experience. Upon entering I was a little dismayed by the interior. Don't get me wrong, it was beautiful and clean but it resembled your average chain restaurant with all of its complexity. However, the meals we ordered proved my assumption wrong. Emiliano's does a great job with \"mainstream\" Mexican family eating and makes it authentic as possible for the type of crowd it caters to.  The chips and salsa were really good. The salsa was authentic and thin and was heavy on the cilantro. I looove cilantro and thought it was delicious. My girlfriend however is not a fan so didn't like it as much. I ordered the carnitas which comes with a sauce of your choosing. I ordered the green tomatillo sauce. The carnitas were shreddable and cooked nicely and the tomatillo sauce had a little spicyness to it. The refried beans and rice were average fair for a Mexican place, nothing special. My only gripes would be the tomatillo sauce compliments the food well when you eat it with tortilla. Left alone with the pork it kind of overwhelmed it. I'm used to getting carnitas without sauce. The other gripe would be you only get three tortillas which isn't enough for the amount of meat and sides you receive.  All in all Emiliano's does a good job of balancing a family-style Mexican place with an authentic way of preparing their food. However, just down the road is El Campesino and it's still my go-to place if I want good sit-down Mexican food. The service was swift and cheerful the whole time and he did a great job filling our drinks up. I'm a vacuum with beverages so I can't stand it when my cup's empty. I'd definitely say I'd go back but when El Campesino is a little closer and just a tad better I'll be sticking with them. All in all though, I'd definitely recommend this place and it's far more impressive if you have a big group to entertain."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and eat here frequently.  The service is typically pretty good.  The food is really really good.  We love the Arroz con Pollo - by far our favorite dish.  The cheese queso dip is very good.  They recently added the table-side fresh guacamole, which is also very good.  And the price isn' too bad either.  My only complaint are the wicker chairs which are terribly uncomfortable - stick to the booths and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"As far as Pittsburgh goes, Emiliano's is some good Mexican food with great service.  Daily food and drink specials are always appetizing as well and the wait is never long.    I've had several items on their menu (nachos, quesadillas, chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas) and I've never been disappointed for lunch or dinner.  The service is always prompt, attentive and friendly.  I've been seated in the main dining room, at the front bar and upstairs.  I haven't yet had an unpleasant experience.  It accomodates singles, couples and even larger groups easily.  Though when it's crowded it can get loud.  While some might debate here over the authenticity, if the point is to keep me coming back for more, Emiliano's wins."}
{"text":"I went to eat at Emiliano's and found this location is now closed. *************************  Our location in McIntyre Square is closed. Please visit us in one of our other locations:  Gibsonia at 5375 William Flynn Hwy  South Side at 2557 E Carson St  Cranberry at 20111 Rt 19 (Coming Soon)"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is better than this joint - it's the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten - I gave it two shots and the second time was more terrible than the first."}
{"text":"a mexican restaurant that makes a crappy margarita cannot expect to be taken seriously. emiliano's house margarita on the rocks= a negligible amount of montezuma tequila (aka the worst well tequila available), sour mix, and some triple sec with waaaaay too much lime juice. ordering a second shot to pour into it will not make this drink any better (believe me, i tried). so sad.  other than that it would have been a solid 4 stars. our server, scott, was excellent. very attentive, and i'm pretty sure my mom was checkin out his tush. go mom.   above average food- we shared some good guacamole and spinach/queso dip, and i ordered an excellent burrito- with poblano sauce that was just the right amount of sweet.  they kept the semi-funky decorations from the building's days as don pablo's, and have made some much needed improvements to the menu and staff.  i would probably not return, however- the margarita is always a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"Coming from California where there are taquerias every mile and my Mexican relatives can make Mexican food, I have searched in vain for anywhere that felt nearly as authentic. As soon as I arrived here, I asked if they served aguas frescas (Mexican drinks like jamaica or horchata) and they stared at me like my face was on backwards. So that did not bode well.  The food is not bad, and the decor is acceptable. The servers were pleasant, but not super fast. There is really nothing authentic tasting here. It tastes like a lot of the more notable flavors of Mexican cuisine have been muted for a less adventurous audience. The beans and rice are passable, and the other dishes are fine - hot, clean, etc. They just don't get it done as authentic, and don't mess with the formula enough to cut it as worthwhile for the trip.   While some people might make asinine comments like \"Drive 2000+ miles to California if you want good Mexican food,\" that is sadly not a realistic option. And while it may be snobby to expect a Mexican place to serve passable Mexican food, it would not be accurate to rate it as great and mislead the fine folks of Pittsburgh about what kind of Mexican food they are getting. If you want good Mexican food, Reyna's in the strip is a much better option."}
{"text":"Authentic it is not. The chips tasted like they came out of a bag, and were more like Doritos than tortilla chips. The salsa was good, but I was expecting more than the two leafs of cilantro. I ordered the Choripollo - two chicken breasts covered with chorizo. Not exactly something I would find in a real Mexican restaurant, but it was quite tasty, even though a tad over salted. The packaged tortillas were rubbery, as are all packaged tortillas. An authentic Mexican restaurant makes its own tortillas.   The service was bad. The server was inattentive, and left us for more than 30 minutes while we decided on dessert. After waiting 30 minutes, the want for dessert waned, like the after dinner drinks we were going to order. We finally had to go to the bar and ask for our ticket.  If you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant, don't get your hopes up. If you've never had authentic Mexican food, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best, and not worth the long wait times to be serviced. My margarita was served in a broken sharp margarita glass. I alerted the waitress to the fact that my glass was broken and she told me i should be lucky to even have a margarita glass, as they are apparently \"hard to come by there\"."}
{"text":"I remember this place when it was Don Pablo's.  Restaurant looks the same, but the food is more authentic. Great drink specials when I was there. Chicken and rice soup needed salt, but not bad otherwise."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Mexican food since I was first introduced to it by a college boyfriend back in 1982. (Yes, I'm dating myself! LOL. I confess:  I'm 50 and not afraid to admit it out loud...or in pixels.) That was also the time I discovered that I LOVED hot and spicy food, especially when washed down by an ice cold cerveza.   When I first discovered Emiliano's in the North Hills at McIntyre Square Mall about 4 years ago, I was DELIGHTED! I've been there many times since then, and their food is ALWAYS delicious, and their staff is always warm and friendly. You can definitely call me a fan.  I love their salsa loaded with fresh cilantro! DELICIOSA! Their mole sauce is exquisite. The fried ice cream for dessert is a decadent way to top off the meal, and so worth it! (Save some room!)  And the service is always top notch. I was so impressed with Emiliano's that I began bringing my friends. I am the main organizer for the Pittsburgh Dining N' At Meetup Group (and an assistant organizer for 9 other Meetup groups), and I am VERY particular about where I take my groups.  Emiliano's has handled groups of 20-30 people for my events, and they never miss a step. They are willing to write separate checks for each person, which is a lot of extra work for their staff, but is a huge help when planning events for an online Dining Club where everyone doesn't already know each other. They really have gone out of their way to accommodate my group every time.   For the past 2 years, I've held an annual benefit dinner at Emiliano's in the North Hills to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. I lost my brother to leukemia in 2004, so this cause is very important to me. The staff at Emiliano's has done such an outstanding job that I decided to make it an annual event!  The annual benefit features a wonderful and delicious ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT DINNER BUFFET with a wide array of items from their menu. They refill the buffet often, and it never runs out, which was one of my fears the first time I planned the event. The food is soooo good, the service is fantastic, and everyone always has a great time, while helping a great cause. The manager also gave me permission to hang flyers in the restaurant, a request that some other establishments have denied me! I am so grateful for the support that Emiliano's has shown me in helping me to plan and promote my event.   My annual benefit dinner is taking place this Thurs., MAY 10, 2012! Check it out:  http://www.yelp.com/events/pittsburgh-emilianos-mexican-dinner-for-the-cure-benefits-leukemia-and-lymphoma-society Learn more about me, my fundraising, and why I do it here:  http://www.deenasfriends4acure.org.  I also love Emiliano's on the South Side, where I held my birthday dinner a couple years ago. But, I'll review that location separately. I am still looking forward to trying their newest location in Gibsonia, but haven't had a chance to get there yet. To be continued...  DISCLAIMER:  I am relatively new to Yelp.com, and just reviewed the guidelines for posting reviews AFTER I wrote all this! Duh. ANYWAY, for the record, I am NOT an employee of Emiliano's, nor do I have any type of personal connection to Emiliano's other than being a huge fan. I am mentioning my fundraising events here because perhaps there are other Yelpers out there in Pittsburgh who are looking for a restaurant with great food and great service to host their future events. Whether it's a fundraiser, a birthday party, or a company dinner; people may find it helpful to know how a restaurant handles large groups. If I had known in advance how SOME places would handle my group, I would never have gone in the first place. I hope this information will be helpful to other event planners in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"And, the great mexican restaurant pittsburgh 2009 tour continues.  I found myself here last Wednesday having some time to kill between appointments.  I get here at about 6 PM and the place is practically empty.  I scoot upstairs to the bar and the bar is empty, so it's easy to get a seat directly in front of one of the two plasmas.  The place is huge.  It used to be a \"Don Pablo's\" years ago.  It has two floors, very high ceilings and plenty of tables and booths. There is a fountain in the middle of the downstairs dining room.  The colors are earthy browns, yellows and blues.  There is the type of ornaments and art you'd expect.  okay, on to the food.  They brought out the customary chips and salsa, chips warm? check! Salsa appropriately spicy, fresh with plenty of cilantro, check!  They seemed to have a good selection of patron and other tequilas.  Unfortunately, I did not indulge as I was still \"on the clock\" so to speak.  I decided to try one of the queso dips.  I got the queso dip with beef.  It was a very healthy portion with plenty of beef.  It was also relatively cheap since I was there for happy hour and all apps' were discounted as well as beer I think.  I can't say I was overwhelmed with it. I mean there was plenty of beef and cheese, but it was a bit bland.  You can also get it with cherizo instead for a buck more and if I go back I'll pick that option.  The queso arrived in a matter of just a couple minutes.  I then ordered the two combo.  If you get it with two sides its $8.49 or $.50 less with just one side.  I was at Patron the weekend prior and it's basically the same cost for their combo.  I kept it simple and settled on one taco and one burrito (beef) and refritos and \"guacamole salad\" as my sides.  The entree also arrived really quick which is good in one sense, but also it's bad in that these items obviously aren't made to order.  The guacamole salad is a bit of a misnomer.  It's basically a small scoop of guac on a couple pieces of shredded lettuce.  I don't know what I was expecting, but this didn't really do much for me.  The refritos were okay, but not as good as Patron.  The burrito and taco were both okay, but again the beef seemed a bit underseasoned.  Overall, the service was attentive and quick but not necessarily friendly.  Usually, when I'm sitting by myself at the bar the bartender makes some effort to chat, but again not a big deal and he may not have be quite fluent in english.  Overall this place probably deserves 2.5 stars and is not nearly as good as Patron or even El Campesino (which are both only a couple miles away).  I don't see how this place will be here for too long given the lack of customers and the two better options in the same area.  I also can't really understand the economics of having such a large restaurant and I'm sure rental payment while selling $2 tacos.  I mean that's got to be a lot of tacos sold to keep the lights on.  It's okay here, but you'll probably enjoy yourself at the two other spots."}
