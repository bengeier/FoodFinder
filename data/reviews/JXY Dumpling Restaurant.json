{"text":"Nothing to really talk about. Food quality is below average to average. Dumplings does not even come near to dumpling king at the plaza next door. Service was nonexistent."}
{"text":"Dumping here tastes very good. I like here. And we order a big dish chicken. Really very big. Taste good too."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good, juicy. Had pork with shrimp. The deep fried plain buns are delicious , service is ok, didn't really clear the table. There is an area where u can see them making the fresh dumplings. Don't recommend the beef brisket noodle soup. 

They can speak English, Cantonese and mandarin . Place is spacious and comfortable and clean. 

Lots of parking available. 

Alcohol is available."}
{"text":"This is my go to for an affordable but authentic Chinese dumpling restaurant. The dumplings (order boiled for juicier dumplings) are always so delicious. I also recommend the pan fried beef dumplings, hand pulled noodle lamb soup, pork knuckle, any lamb dish, and stir fried cabbage. It's not a fancy place but it's amazing for a casual dinner when you don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty!!!

What else can I say?! Between $5.99-7.99 gets you 12 dumplings either boiled or steamed with fillings ranging from pork to lamb to chicken to seafood or even just veggies! Each dumpling is delecatly hand made and served to you hot and juicy.  Unlike some other places I've tried the juice inside is actually juice and not just oil! So glad to have tried the place.  

Other items on the menu range from noodles to mains and beyond.  We tried the house made stir fried noodles which were very good but a touch oily.

Would highly recommend for an inexpensive lunch. The dumplings are sure to please."}
{"text":"This place is decent for dumplings among other items on their menu. The price is also reasonable for the amount of dumplings you get (a dozen $5.99). Unfortunately, they only have it boiled or steamed dumplings (I prefer them fried).

Service is alright.. there was a server walking around aimless the whole time we were dinning there. Couldn't even get her attention to fill the teapot and the roof was dripping was from the raining earlier.

Probably won't return as I can get dumplings any where. The dripping roof was pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"Our go-to dumpling place. Service is quick and the food is good. Dumplings are made fresh and taste is flavourful, not to mention inexpensive. Panfried beef dumpling is one of my favorites. Soo juicy on the inside but crispy on the outside. Their cold appetiser chicken in chili oil/sauce is also really good. House special noodles are also a must try. Chewy and delicious. A solid 4/5!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. The clear noodles in chili sauce was sweet and packed with Chili heat. The sauerkraut pork dumplings has really good flavor and you can taste the freshness of the dumpling and wrap. The pork and shrimp dumplings were good as well, the soup in it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place will hit the spot if you're craving quality dumplings. I think it would have been better if I was more hungry but it was allrrriiight. 

Food: Overall, the food was solid. We ordered a fried rice dish that was very under seasoned. The braised beef noodle soup was good but this place puts a spicy spin to the dish so buyer beware. The dish that really stuck out to us was the \"Fried Beef Dumplings\". Great beef to dumpling ratio, very crispy. We also tried the steamed pork leek egg and shrimp dumplings which had amazing texture and flavour and you get like 12 for 7 bucks. [jheez!] 

Service:  Whomps.

Ambiance: Modern decor very clean. Black and red theme to match the chili oil."}
{"text":"My favourite and go to place (not for dumplings per say) but for all their spicy dishes!! They have such a large variety and they are actually spicy. My favourite dish is their spicy fish in chili oil which I highly recommend (takes a bit to come, but worth the wait). The fish was soooo smooth and cooked to perfection. It's a must order every time I come. I also really liked their lamb in cumin and fried chili chicken"}
{"text":"Summary: decent dumplings, mediocre appetizers, BIG portions on their noodles, and a BOLD location down the street from DUMPLING KING is comfortable, spacious, but ultimately lacking the flavour and kick to challenge the King. 

Top Get: Lamb Noodles
Top Regret: Lamb Dumplings
What I'd Try Next Time: Pork and Cabbage Dumplings 

Feeling dumplings AND a sense of adventure, we made a radical decision to try dumplings somewhere other than Dumpling King or New Northern Dumplings... and the results left me still craving dumplings. 


We ordered Steamed Lamb Dumplings, Beef Rolls, Green Onion Pancakes, Lamb Noodles, Zucchini and Egg Dumplings (like I said, adventurous!)

FOOD
Lamb Noodles came first. if you're wondering about the price tag, it's because it can feed a VERY big eater like myself. I really enjoyed their wide-style noodles, and the soup base was pretty tasty. The actual pieces of lamb weren't very tender, but overall this was a pretty good albeit pricey dish!

Next, the Lamb Dumplings: REAL bland and not that juicy - I ended up adding in a chunk of chili oil to it, which might be the first time I've ever done that with lamb dumplings. 

The Zucchini and Egg Dumplings were slightly better than the lamb (now there's something I never thought I'd say) but still below my standard of Dumpling gobbling. Definitely a unique option, though!

The Green Onion pancakes were actually decent, but compared to other local spots, decent just doesn't cut it anymore.

The Beef Rolls were oddly and inconsistently sauced. I had one piece that was completely lacking in sauce and another piece that had more - suffice to say, the first bite was meh and the second bite was better.


SERVICE
Service was a bit slow on the uptake (in terms of getting water, taking an order, and following through on orders), but I think we had a new waiter. 


SPACE
Nice and open. Maybe a bit dark. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday evening, which is why the slow service was more noticeable.


If you want good noodles from a Dumpling spot, come here! Any thing else (appetizers/dumplings), there are probably better options."}
{"text":"My last review still stands. This is more of an update on the dumplings. I'm eating them as leftovers right now, and after having been microwaved, the wrappers are still super thin, and some of them still have juice inside. There's also a pretty good amount of filling inside. At $5.99 for 12, I really should come more often. I'm definitely planning on it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a weekend night as I was craving for some dumplings. Reviews here were decent and the restaurant is super close to my house so we decided to come here. Fairly busy when we came on Saturday evening. We ordered different dishes including 2 sets of steamed dumplings, the pan-fried beef dumplings, the green onion pancake and this spicy jelly dish. The steamed dumplings were good but the star here was the pan-fried beef dumplings- it was really good. I was little surprised to see very limited selection for pan-fried dumplings. I think they need to add more selection for this to their menu. I found the service was mediocre because I had to ask for water 3 different times with 3 different waiters before I got my water. Somehow, we ended getting the wrong order of dumplings. We ordered the pork dumplings but we ended up getting the pork dumplings with peas and didn't realize it till we left the restaurant. Overall, the pan fried beef dumplings were really good so definitely get that. I would not get the jelly like dish- tasted pretty bad and not good. The steamed dumplings were good. Wouldn't mind coming back here- they really need to be more attentive in their service to the customers."}
{"text":"We ordered the steamed pork, shrimp, egg, and leek dumplings as well as their house special fried noodles. 

Dumplings were authentic and juicy. They're comparable to the Dumpling King but a bit more expensive.

Stir fried noodles were also really good. Good flavour and portion size as well."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good dumpling Chinese dumplings with little steamers this place has good portions and service is good, my bench seat was ripped cleanliness could have been better we also had the noodle with lamb tasted really good but the noodle was kind of soft it's one of those knife noodle type with very fat noodle but the longer  in the soup the more soggy it became but overall it was good portions for the price"}
{"text":"Average dumplings. I orders the pork and green bean steamed 12 pc and the filling tasted like taco filling. The pork was ground up and had a very grainy texture. I really ordered a taco dumpling - next big food venture?? Maybe??

Also I came in looking for soup dumplings but apparently they didn't serve them? (Note that I'm not Chinese and can't speak/read mandarin or Cantonese, so maybe it was the language barrier?) but it was a disappointment. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is also very basic. 

Don't think I'll be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok,??????????????????????????d???????"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Dumpling spot in the newer plaza by Midland and Finch. It's located at the corner where the old sushi restaurant used to be so it's not hard to miss. 

We got the standard Green Onion Pancake which were really bland and dry. The cold peanut noodles were great, along with the boiled cabbage and pork dumplings as well as the steamed egg and chive dumplings. The dumpling wrapper wasn't too thick, and managed to hold all of the filling without breaking apart. The Hot & Sour soup was REALLY hot, and tasted more vinegary. The Brisket Noodles in Soup looked fantastic, however the looks were deceiving as the soup wasn't as flavourful and the brisket was very chewy.

The staff that work here are friendly and the layout of the restaurant itself is kind of odd, however it's a decent place to get your dumpling fix."}
{"text":"Great dumpling restaurant, highly recommended. 

Came here for some late night dinner at 9pm on Saturday in a group of 5 and got seated within 10mins wait. The server handed us a paper menu and we basically just had to mark down which item we wanted. 

I was recommended to try this dumpling restaurant by a friend, so we've decided to try out 3 of their dumpling flavours. We got the Vegetarian, Pork and Bak Choi, and Pork and Shrimp, all steam cooked in the bamboo plate. The price was good too, around $7 you get 12 dumplings per plate and it was definitely really filling. I liked how thin the skin of the dumplings was, it showed the skill of the chef. The meat on the inside was really juicy, so be careful so you don't burn your tongue or accidentally squirt the juice across the table lol.

We didn't get try out their other items, but if I'm coming back for another meal I'll definitely order some other items. Just judging on the dumpling, this place is A+"}
{"text":"This is a legit shanghai style restaurant. The noodles and dumplings are fresh and handmade. I also had the lamb soup noodle which was great! Reasonably priced and I think it is better than other shanghai style restaurants. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"Craving for some handmade dumplings? This MIGHT be a place for you....

It was nice to see fresh dumplings being made by the chef while you enjoy your meal. The restaurant wasn't too busy so the staffs were pretty efficient at their tasks. However, the staffs need to pay more attention to their customers instead of RACING to drop dishes on the table and leave. We had to wave down the waitress because spoons weren't given.

Note: You should have some knowledge of Mandarin or have a personal translator, it will come in handy. I was trying to ask for something in English and she had NO IDEA what I was talking about. O.o

We ordered the lamb dumpling and the tomato & egg noodles. The food was pretty decent!

Steamed Lamb & Coriander dumplings - Each dumpling contained sooo much soup! I made a huge mess on the table because as I bite into the dumpling all the soup kept squirting everywhere. OMG?!  Talk about table etiquette... totally lost it at this restaurant ...opps, my bad! Also, I liked how thin the wrapper was!! The lamb was very moist and seasoned well! I kept craving for more. However, it was a little oily. 

Tomato & Egg noodles - this simple yet sophisticated dish. There were lots of tomato and eggs in this dish! The noodles were well made. There was a good amount of sauce - love the sweet and sour combination. 

Overall, other than the language barrier and the service was slightly lacking. The food was pretty good. After I brush up my mandarin, I'll definitely try this place again! ^^"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday around 3pm and saw that this was close by to my location. Tried the items everyone on here was talking about. Ordered the pork cabbage dumplings (two dozen) , beef wrap, hand pulled noodles and green onion pancakes. I agree that the dumplings were juicy but they weren't very flavourful. Lots of soup came out but it wasn't anything special besides that. Green onion pancake had literally no taste... couldn't taste the onion at all. Felt like I was eating dough. Beef wrap was just the green onion pancake wrapped around some sweet beef? Didn't really taste that great, was very dry. Handpull noodle was probably the biggest disappointment. This dish was 8.99 and the portion we got was small. The noodle tasted bland and they have half cooked tomatoes in it. It was mainly bean sprouts, cabbage, tomatoes and like 5 pieces of shredded meat. The tomatoes made it kind of cold which wasn't that great. The staff was very attentive and the seating was very spacious. Probably not going to come back, there's plenty of other dumpling places in that area that I feel is a lot better."}
{"text":"On a typical Friday late night search for food, we decided to check out JXY Dumpling Restaurant.  Sounding more like an airport 3 letter designation, JXY delivers some pretty good northern style dumplings, noodles and other specialities to the region.

I have to admit the pork and cabbage dumplings were some of the best I've had in a long time.  There were more like soup dumplings as each one was packed full of broth that exploded all over if your are not careful! The skin was slightly thick but had a great chew which some people might prefer over the ultra thin ones. 

Another stand out was the JXY Stir Fried Hand Pulled Noodles which was done really well as the noodles were full of flavour and had the perfect texture.

The only problem was that the menu was just an order sheet and no pics were provided in a separate menu so you don't know what the item looked like.  We ordered something called the \"JXY Chicken in a Big Plate\" and really couldn't believe how freaking big the plate was!  Filled with chicken, potatoes, veggies and noodles it was enough to feed 4 easily!

The service was friendly and attentive and the staff understood Mandarin, Cantonese and English as well.  Overall really enjoyed our dinner and would definitely come back especially for the dumplings!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times.  Never disappointed with their dumplings, esp the shrimp/pork and zucchini/egg - both steamed.  The non-dumpling dishes are generally ok.  When in Scarborough, definitely give them a try if dumplings ate your thing."}
{"text":"-My boyfriend and I entered this plaza looking for something to eat and decided on this dumpling restaurant just when walking by.
-The dumplings appear to be made fresh to order. You can see the staff making them :)
-We ordered the Lamb/Coriander Dumplings and the Pork/Egg/Leek Dumplings: BOTH WERE DELICIOUS. Each order has 12 pieces!
-We also ordered the Kung Pao chicken which was okay. 
-Tea was good quality.
-Very tasty and we will definitely return for another round of dumplings!!!"}
{"text":"We randomly picked this place after searching for dumpling at late night. We got 4 dumpling dishes because we thought it's small portion. But it is huge and reasonable price. We also had stir fried pork intestines & handmade noodle soup with lamb. It is awesome. I love it!!! We will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"JXY is a relatively new player to the dumpling game, having only opened in the past year or so. Their namesake dish does not disappoint, with dumplings that feature ample amounts of filling that's both moist and tender. That being said, the other dishes I've tried, such as the green onion pancake, beef rolls, and beef noodle soup, were a bit of a disappointment in the sense that portions were small compared to other dumpling/Northern Chinese establishments. The interior decor was nice, though seating is a bit cramped. Customer service can be hit-or-miss depending on how busy it is, and it's often a busy spot given its central location. All in all, this is a great place for dumplings, though their other food could use some improvement."}
{"text":"This place was much better than expected and a good dinner place. The lamb and chives dumplings had a strong chive taste and quite impressive. I could eat those all day. The stir-fry lamb with cumin and onions was good but too oily. The tomato and egg noodles were amazing; they used the right kind of noodles so that each strand of noodle held the sauce well. The service was efficient and I will definitely be back.

P.S. One interesting item listed under the desserts was \"Fries with oatmeal\". If anyone has tried this item please do share!"}
{"text":"JXY Dumpling Restaurant has quite an extensive menu. But as this is my first visit, I have to try their dumplings.

Price wise is reasonable as a dozen of freshly made dumplings for $5.99. I like how they were just the perfect size as one bite, so soup would not be everywhere while biting into it. There is also a choice of steamed or boiled. I highly recommended the steamed option.

Cold Noodle in Chili Sauce ($5.99) was not bad. Good as a side on a hot summer day. But nothing too memorable and not too spicy.

Service was fast and friendly. 

Warning: if you are a clean freak, you might not like it here. Everything feels sticky including the chopsticks......."}
{"text":"I quite like the food here.  We ordered a dozen of steamed pork with napa cabbage dumplings, a sour and spicy noodle soup and a beef roll.  The beef roll was supposed to be an appetizer, but be forewarned that it was huge.  I could have it as a lunch on its own.  It was richly seasoned with salt and oil.  The dough was sweet and soft, while the filling was savory and slightly moist from the oil of the meat.  It was a decent app.  The sour and spicy noodle soup was not too spicy.  The meat portion was adequate.  The noodle portion could feed two people of average appetite.  Last but not least, the dumplings were hand made dumplings.  They were stuffed with meat.  The wrapping was thin.  The quality was notably better than many dumplings joints.  They were lightly seasoned, so I added flavors by dipping into a sauce mix of vinegar and soy sauce.

Services was sufficient.  Servers speak in Mandarin, and a few could communicate in English.  

A solid 3.5 stars family restaurant.  I will return to try other offerings.  Maybe the next visit will push the rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and really enjoyed the food.  They have this eggplant, potato and green pepper dish that is a must order.

Also I enjoyed their hand pulled noodles.  The texture is totally different from regular noodles but it was good.

They have a pretty big selection of food and they have dumplings! Lol"}
{"text":"A 3.75 out of 5 star review.  Rounded up to 4. 

THIN shell casings, these dumplings pack a bite of flavours.  You can order most as either boiled or steamed.  We prefer steamed for its texture and presentation.  The \"pork and shrimp\" dumplings are juicy and well seasoned.  I would avoid the \"pork and green bean\" dumplings as it came out rather dry and tough for the palette.  Maybe boiled would have been better?  The fried beef dumplings (6 per order) are also very flavourful.  Sure it's a tad oily to palette but that's normal.  

We also ordered the \"clear noodle in chilli sauce ??\".  This northern China dish came out subpar lacking balanced taste, spiciness and noodle disintegrates upon pickup with chopsticks.  

Overall, as a dumpling house it is decent.  Service was somewhat attentive. I would recommend for its steamed and fried dumplings.  

P.s: men's washroom smelled horrendous, when was the last time they sanitized it?"}
{"text":"Way too long for food to arrive. Ordered steamed beef green beans dumpling. That took 45 mins to make nothing spectacular.  Ordered the specialty lamb . The smell and taste of the lamp wasn't too pleasant. I thought with the sauce it would be unnoticeable but it still smells like someone's armpits."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant as it is very authentic and the portions are generous. They make their dumplings and soup buns from scratch, and you can watch the ladies making them at a corner with fresh ingredients. Their noodle dishes are very tasty, and we like ordering the tomato base noodles. As well, we like their beef wrap which is a famous Northern China dish. Their food is very tasty and authentic Northern Chinese food if you are looking for that. The pricing is also decent."}
