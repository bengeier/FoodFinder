{"text":"The food at this place was good or may be we just got really hungry after the 75 minutes wait because when your hungry anything tastes good. Yes people we waited for 75 minutes and the person at the counter who looked like a manager didn't even care because he was having a few drinks at his own bar. There was no one else at the restaraunt so its not like the kitchen was busy. My advice save your time and go to Royal India."}
{"text":"Ordered the avocado and brie sandwich, it was good quality, particularly given the price--it was exactly what you'd expect it to be. Went with a huge crowd and considering the service was fast and attentive. Everyone generally seemed happy with their menu selections. Good place to bring a large group for a casual gathering"}
{"text":"I do not like this place - When it first opened, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food but I dont know if it has changed management or chefs or what but I DO NOT LIKE IT HERE anymore... The decor is alright, the food is a crapshoot - Sometimes you get a relatively good dish, and a couple of times I've gotten very sick from eating something and then decided not to return for a third attempt. The service, from the last time I went, was not good.  The waitress was rather rude and the host seemed like he would rather be anywhere else then taking us to a table (he seemed a little angry that we were even there and took is sweet time finding a table for us in the near empty dining room). Not my cup of tea anymore..."}
{"text":"Before ordering I went to use the restroom which was dirty, smelled like puke and the toilet had some sort of leak near the flush valve and so they propped a bucket under it and I just prayed that the bucket full of mystery toilet water didn't spill on me. As you can imagine this wasn't the most appetizing experience and to top it all off my soup came with a huge hair in it. I sent it back and didn't order anything else because I was too grossed out. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered quesadillas..it took forever.  They were super small and just made of bread and cheese.I can make better ones at home.   The \"BBQ\" sauce tasted nothing likeBBQ. It was spicy and  I had asked about the taste before I even got it so I don't know why the waitress would even give it to me after I told her what I expected."}
{"text":"I had a delicious eggplant sandwich and salad for 5.75. If I wasn't on my lunch break I would have had a beer too. It was that kind of place. I just wanted to linger a little longer and enjoy a pint with some friends.  Alas, I am grown up now, and must go to work. Oh well.   Some other time maybe. This is a cheap and cheerful place with an affordable menu that makes it popular with the Uni crowd.  My lunchmate enjoyed an impressive sized  thai dish and devoured every last bit of it.  The next table raved about the lentil soup."}
{"text":"Oh, Nirvana, how I love you so. In the past year I've visited Nirvana more times than I count on one hand, and I've always been extremely pleased with my experience.  Both the food and the drinks are cheap and delicious. The menu is very varied: many delicious sandwiches, some asian fusion dishes, a selection of pizzas and pastas, all mixed in with some standard pub grub. As for drinks, your best bet is the sangria. I can't recall the exact price of a pitcher (and it seems that previous reviewers have stated differing amounts), but it's very reasonably priced. Plus, you can get oh-so-super-delicious white sangria AND you can then also pick your special fruit flavour, either strawberry, peach, or pear. I highly recommend the strawberry white.  Also of note, they have free wifi! Definitely a good place to check out for midday work sessions when you want something a little bit different from the standard cafe spot.  Random Nirvana experience story: Now, I know I don't eat a lot, nor am I a very expensive drunk. But still, I once shared a platter of nachos with 3 friends and a pitcher of strawberry white sangria with 1 friend and came away both full and very nicely tipsy for only $11.50 including tax and tip. You really can't beat that."}
{"text":"Nirvana is my home away from home. My roommate and I frequent this place too many times to speak of. We also love to bring new comers to experience how great it is.  I have almost tried every food on the menu. Their hummus is delicious, the chicken curry is crazy good, as well as the fried tofu and the pesto fettucini.   As far as drinks go, cheap Caesar's on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesdays. Everyday fave are their pitchers of Red Wine Sangria (or white if you so desire) for a mere 13.50$  Atmosphere is relaxed, people are great, I couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"BLAT sandwich - so good."}
{"text":"Food is Very good! Price is reasonable. Service sucks, there's only 1 person working front and food takes FOREVER!! And I'm serious if you going and your super hungry or starving you might faint!! Even if you the only table min wait is 45 min for food. True story!"}
{"text":"I was on the way to brunch with a friend when we saw the amazingly cheap priced drinks, and what better way to spend a sunny sunday brunch than by knocking back a few $3.95 cesars...we were sold.  We also has some eats, I wasn't really impressed with the eggs benny, but it was also cheap and you get what you pay for.  I thought the servers were great, we had a great couple hours sitting on the patio enjoying the people watching. I would return for the drink specials, but the food not so much."}
{"text":"Horrible service & FOOD. Ordered aloo parantha got just prantha with no aloo in it!!  Ordered mango lassi two times but never came ! Got panner kulcha instead of aloo kulcha.  Had this experience two times... & no one was there to listen.  Won't go back their again!! Even if someone offer free food.  Disgusting place"}
{"text":"Nirvana is like a second home to me. I've certainly been known to eat there more than once a day. The food and drinks are insanely cheap but still super yummy. The staff are friendly and super babely as well (a little eye candy with your meal never hurt anyone).   Lots of veg options which is great for me as a vegetarian. A few faves are the avacado and brie sandwich and the eggplant wrap, as well as the pesto pizza! Can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries either at no extra cost!  Brunch is always delish - I love the eggs florentine (only available sat & sun) which come with sweet potato fries and a fruit cup. YUM!  Also they put cinnamon in the coffee - so addictive. Love it."}
{"text":"When this place open first time it was pretty good. When I visited last time service was very very very ... POOR.  I order some food and lady who was taking order miss some stuff to bring in and I ask for it and they said you have to wait...  This is not good place to go now. Food is not as same before.. Service is always question..   I give this restaurant 3 chances but it failed all the time.  Poor service and average food"}
{"text":"I have visited this delightful bar on two occasions. There are a lot of reviews so I'll keep this one short. The food is always good and priced properly and their daily drink specials are worth it as well.  Under $4 shooters in the city on a Friday night can be nothing but good times. Service from my experience has been consistently decent in contrast to other reviews. I would recommend this to 20-something students and young workers in the city looking for a bite to eat and drinks on any day of the week. Also their brunch menu has some great items."}
{"text":"Their nirvana sandwich was very good. Nice small patio too and they had friendly servers. Service was a bit slow though."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices. Food is good and generally nice place. Early 20s clientele.  First time I'd been in, but I was quite surprised as the outside looked a bit of a dump.  Visa payments are taken at the bar so don't pay the $2 to use the ATM machine."}
{"text":"By far one of the most casual and inexpensive spots in the city. Great for small get togethers, drinks and/or large parties. The decor is definitely very zen yet super stylish. Even though I wish the patio was larger, there is more than enough room to accommodate large parties. There is something really charming about this place. The staff is always friendly and really attentive, and the food is always on point. I'm a huge fan of the stir-fry! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"It seems like I can't go here at night without getting really drunk. Its pretty cheap, laid back, and the service is usually at least acceptable  The food is alright for the price, though some days are definitely better than others. I seldom go anymore if I don't plan on drinking though."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place and the food was old. I had throw everything away. Waste of money. Avoid this place unless you want a stomach bug."}
{"text":"One of my favorite TO. hangouts. Mixed drinks aren't so good though, but great location, fantastic ambiance, great cheap wine and good grub.  Best place to hangout and grab a beer after work."}
{"text":"They clearly don't know how to run a bar at night. I'm not sure how it is during the day, but to have a requirement to have a table in order to buy a drink at the bar is ridiculous, and they were extremely rude and pretentious about it too. Also, when we got a table just to order a single round, they took FOREVER! Slowest service I've ever experienced and they weren't even busy. I've worked in the hospitality industry for over 8 years and I've NEVER seen such poor oranization."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    Ok, am I sitting in the Red Room? I'm sitting in the Red Room, right? Ok, good.  The meals are very cheap ($5-10) and taste like it. The beer is fine, and priced very reasonably. It's a spot in a good location where you're likely to find seating for anywhere from 2-8 people, and the lacklustre service is balanced out by the lack of attitude.  The decor is interesting, with some sort of Buddha-inspired theme... Oh wait, is this the Red Room?  2 stars"}
{"text":"It's alright. Decent indian food not the best. The food tastes too sweet I don't know why. The waiter is nice and the decor is outstanding."}
{"text":"It looked like a fine dine restaurant at the entry. However as you sit and start your meal, the experience dips.  Ambience good but dim and depressing, Food below average, service pathetic. I went there on my sister's bday and ordered papri chaat, samosa and Tikki. Only Papdi chaat was good. In the main course, we ordered Kadhai Paneer and Daal makhani and they were just okay but eatable. Breads were better. The server disappointed us, she got us a disgusting used glass having milky froth on the top for water. When we called her and asked to change the water glass, she didn't apologise even once and said 'oh I poured water in a clean glass'. We were so surprised with her reply as we didn't have any clue what she really meant by saying something that stupid. After that while clearing our plates she dropped stuff on my wallet and didn't pick up the used fork until I picked myself and gave her. Her hands weren't busy , she just waited for me to pick that up. I won't go to that place again and don't recommend it to anybody else."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, lots of good points, good service, great prices, probably one of the most reasonable restaurants as far as pricing in Toronto.  The food taste was just OK, the hummus was a very small portion and the taste was just OK, the other dishes ranged from OK to good. Nice atmosphere, great price and good service, wish the kitchen was a bit better."}
{"text":"Much like its sister restaurants, the Green and Red Rooms, I find that Nirvana lacks a certain something.  Nirvana is a bit like the slightly more sophisticated older sister of a friend of yours...she seems so cool from afar but when you finally get to talk to her you realizes she wears Designer Imposters and mispronounces \"Proust\".  On the face of things, Nirvana seems like it is what the Green Room wants to be when it grows up.  The menu is more fulsome, the drinks list is much more varied and sophisticated, and the decor is much much improved.  The waitstaff is better looking and the lighting is less squinty-dim and more candlelight intimacy.  A friend in from out of town a few weeks ago and we ended up at Nirvana because some of the preferred haunts nearby were all full.  I was excited for the fried tofu appetizer and some of the cocktails, although I reserved judging anything as the last few times I'd been there I'd not found anything too remarkable.  When my friend got her Tom Collins she laughed out loud - not only was it lime Jello green (they aren't supposed to be), it didn't taste like there was any booze in it, which nearly seems impossible in a gin-based drink.  I ordered the Lychee Spritz and had the same experience - it tasted like melted ice and a hint of lychee - no real booze in this beverage, and none of the promised grapefruit juice either, oddly.    Our food came and it was decent - not amazing but not absolutely terrible either.  With an avowed effort we avoided finishing our drinks and waited to see if the waitress would offer to replace them or at least knock a few bucks off the bill.  Except...she didn't come back.  Yes, it was busy, but other tables had busting servers shuttling back and forth on a regular basis.  We?  Sat.  For a long time.  At the hour mark we debated just walking out, fortunately enough for Nirvana our better natures prevailed.  When the waitress did come back she was kind of curt, maybe because we hadn't ordered enough booze or food to warrant a good tip...not that we'd been given the opportunity.  Overall the experience was fine - we chatted and people watched, something that is hard to avoid there, with such a huge open dining space packed full of people.  But I'm still a bit peeved at the drinks and bill situation.  Nirvana is DEFINITELY a step in the right direction, but I think at this rate, the owners need to open like four or five more venues before they're gonna get it right."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting here and ordered Thai noodle soup.  The soup was so tasty and good amount.  Price is pretty reasonable and restaurant had nice zen atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go in the afternoon to drink far to much coffee and fill up on cheap food while working on essays. It's also a good place to go in the evening with a friend to spend a long time sipping sangria and chatting. It's even good for late night snacks. If you've got time and you're not expecting too much.  The beer selection is pretty good for mainstream, but not super fantastic. Last time I was there they had blanche de chambly and tankhouse on tap, among other things. Bottled wine is pretty inexpensive, but you're getting what you pay for. Sangria is absolutely not traditional, but still a pretty yummy juice and wine concoction. They have a list of interesting cocktails that I haven't sampled, but always consider.  The space is large, which is nice cause it's almost always possible to find a table, whether you're with one other person or five other people. And, except at the busiest times, a person can feel comfortable sitting alone with a book and a bevvie, confident that they're not taking up a needed table.  Unfortunately, the large space makes it difficult for the servers to see what's going on with everyone and makes it easy for them to forget about you because they don't pass by each time they go to the bar. I have had good service here once or twice, but most of the time something is mixed up or forgotten and I can count on sitting for a good long time waiting for orders to be taken or bills to arrive.   I don't seem to mind the lacklustre service here for two reasons, I think. One, I know what I'm getting into and the servers don't give me the impression that they think they're any better than they are. And two, it's super cheap. The delicious chicken and avocado sandwich I often eat is $6. The huge plates of noodles are under 10$. Can't argue with prices like that."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here! We stopped in for lunch and a beer today and three of us had a meal and a drink for $40. The food was so fresh, and after trading bites of each other's sandwiches we all argued about whose was better (it was mine, the Nirvana sandwich, although the smoked salmon was a very close second). The one complaint we had about the food was that the sweet potato fries we ordered (at no extra cost and accompanied by a delicious chipotle mayo) were quite cold on our plates. Overall great experience, great value, eclectic (though as my mother in law pointed out, very dusty) decor, and good service. Will return to try the renowned sangria!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  food -got pad thai and it was great! Portion was quite generous too!  drinks -cheap shooters on fridays, costing 3.75 per shooter with a wide variety!  decor -really really dark in there, but the chandelier lights were very nice  service -average  final verdict: i'd come back for the food (cheap) and drinks again!"}
{"text":"Exactly the same as the Green Room, Java House, The Last Temptation, Pour Boy, and any of the others in that group (they all have the same menu) only the beer was a lot worse than the others (though I admit that I haven't been to Java or the Last Temptation in a few years). My companion said it was that the pipes and taps weren't clean.  being at Bathurst/college doesn't help - super busy, an awkward lay-out that makes it quite difficult to get to and from the bathroom, and a whole heap of better stuff around. Check out cloak and dagger or sneaky dee's instead."}
{"text":"Very chill spot. GReat selection of food. Very tasty, at a great price. Always bumpin great tunes. and their kitchen is open late!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Yummy food, cheap beer (on Wednesday nights) and a small but vibrant front patio thats perfect for watching the circus over at Sneaky Dees. I wish Id taken a photo of my dinner last night (Nirvana sandwich with sweet potato fries) or of my friend's (grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and side salad) as no sandwich has any business being so pretty."}
{"text":"After a very full dinner at Caplansky's deli, my friend and I attempted to seek some refuge from the cold and stumbled on this place.  As soon as we walked in, we noticed the chandeliers and hipster vibe - it was like walking into an Urban Outfitters.  While we didn't order any food, we did order quite a few rounds of drinks.  Their drink menu was quite impressive both in length and price.  Needless to say, I was a happy camper about the latter as I was able to pump myself full of alcohol before returning to the oh not so cold anymore cold.  I'd definitely make another trek here if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food is soso, but the atmosphere is good at the weekend, it usually fills up with groups of friends sitting together and getting loud and chatty.  Beer is, reasonable drinks selection.  Service is pretty good.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. I appreciate this business,since they have put together an incredible brand. Great food + awesome architecture and physical structures + music+ lightening. I really like how everything is set up. Definitely reminds me how much I miss my culture in India.the food and the atmosphere there.  I tend to order out more at Nirvana through skipdishes, but when I go to this restaurant ...right when you walk in the beautiful aroma from the food + the decorations + the atmosphere hits my heart passionately like it does in India. And I love that because a lot of Indian restaurants in Calgary can't do that since the food is not up to expectation and the building structure is just normal building. So if a restaurant can remind you of India and make you miss India...thats gt to be one heck of a restaurant if you ask me.  The way Nirvana chooses to add flavor and love to the recipe,the way they make the gravy part of the sabji/dal, the way they cut up the vegetables,and the unique blend of spices they are using is great.Seems like they have some great educated Chefs. Even I have to say sometimes I order a salad at different restaurants. They just cut up cucumber, tomatoes, onions, lettuce that's it.Just blah no flavor, not even lemon cut up.That is super annoying to me. When your a restaurant going a little further in your recipes will help and I guarantee you the customer will come back. I ordered a salad from Nirvana I didn't have to tell them anything. They added their own top class flavor + style to the salad. They cut up the vegetables beautifully and even added a little light masala. I was happy. :) So if their basic salad is top rated imagine how great their food is! They know how to bring in the traditional ethnic flavors.  I always end up taking selfies here to haha because of the beautiful colors and atmosphere. A 5/5 from me to you Nirvana. Goodluck for 2018!   Sincerely, Harjot"}
{"text":"This place is a great staple. Here is why:  MENU * It is very very very affordable * large selection. something to please everyone * food quality is basic but there is nothing to complain about  DECOR eclectic but casual but romantic but cozy    STAFF * friendly cute etc * they tend to \"let you be\" so if you are in a rush...you might have to be aggressive to get your bill - the plus side is if you want to sit for a while there is never any pressure to leave :)  WEEKEND BRUNCH * cheap. big portions. big menu * no hipster lineups * lots of seating * low lighting so you don't have to doll-up * and a new menu addition no more home fries its sweet potato fries  ya good I know!  PEOPLE All types of people to go Nirvana: * university/college students * young professionals being casual * hipsters being casual. more plaid less neon. * not obnoxious families [usually for early dinner]  GREAT SPOT FOR * date * brunch * large groups [there are long tables] * working alone session [free wifi] * intimate drinks like where you want to sit and talk forever * awkward meet-up - the atmosphere is really comfortable not awkward and food service is fast if you want to get out! * patio drinks etc etc etc  FREE WIFI"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this place. The service is casual but the place is so cheap and chill its always been worth it. The food is definitely nice for this price point, great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Wait, this isn't the Red Room? Or is it?  A fun chillin spot, which can get pretty busy and loud, but a nice ambiance still.  The food is good, the staff are nice too. All in all, a great place to meet up to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Good burgers, good beer selection, and great prices. Also, the staff are friendly and the inside is nice looking. The location is also excellent: if it's too full, Sneaky Dees etc. is nearby."}
{"text":"Great price on beer, just as well on the food.  Service a little lacking, but not enough to prevent from going back.  Overall, great place to hang with a friend or two and pound back some cold ones with some munches ."}
{"text":"Things never bode well when it takes 10 minutes to get a server to acknowledge your presence at a table. So began our disappointing experience at un-aptly named \"Nirvana\".   Number of Restaurant 101 rules broken: FOUR  #1 - Acknowledge customers within 5 minutes of arrival, with water served immediately.  FAIL. Server took 10 minutes to hurriedly provide us with menus and offer drinks.   #2 - Visit table every so often to offer refills and provide updates on ETA of food order.   FAIL. Beer glass sat empty and we never got offered refills over a 40 minute period! We were thirsty, and hungry.. Getting to that next.  #3 - Food should take max 30 minutes to come out.   FAIL. While the eclectic decor and tables-full of hipsters put us into a laid back mood, we were sad when our simple order (burger and wrap) took 40 minutes, despite the table next to us getting their order pretty fast.   #4 - Apologize and offer a solution -  don't give excuses!  FAIL. After 40 minutes, my partner asked the server where the food was, she said it would be right out, but didn't apologize. Another server then told us that they were missing a member of the kitchen staff, blah blah blah. We had to ask them for a discount, when really, they should have offered this right away. To make matters (even) worse, the order was wrong!!!  Needless to say, we came with high hopes and empty stomachs, and left disappointed and hungry. :-(  On a side note, the ladies' washroom was pretty gross. Also a red flag that management doesn't give a sh&t."}
{"text":"Nirvana sometimes gets a bad rap - I've read many reviews claiming that the service is slow and that the place is dirty. I'm not going to deny that Nirvana isn't a bit of a hole in the wall...but if you take it for what it is, you are likely to be impressed! Take a chance on Nirvana and you can expect super cheap prices, different drink specials every night of the week, and surprisingly good thai-fusion food!    ***Here are some pointers from someone who has WORKED at Nirvana!***   * Alcohol is ALWAYS cheap, but then there are great drink specials every night of the week! Sangria Sundays are always a huge hit (red and white sangria available)! Drink specials are listed on the drink menu, or just ask your server!  * The draft is primarily local beers - no Canadian or Coors Light here. On the other hand, there is a large selection of bottles, perfect for both those who are adventurous or who would prefer to play it safe with your standard domestics (Canadian, Bud, Coors).  * Ice cold beer? It's cold - but don't expect frozen. This is an old building, and there are no sub-zero taps to be found.  * This is a SIT DOWN place and there is no Service Bar, so if you're the sort who likes to lean on the bar, ordering shots, or want to mingle with a large group of friends, Nirvana may not be for you  * There's LOTS of seating, but it can be a little cramped sometimes. Keep this in mind if you're bringing a group. They do take evening reservations, so call ahead! No reservations accepted for brunch.  * It can get super packed over brunch and at night, especially on Friday and Saturdays. Couple this with background music, and Nirvana can get loud! Don't be surprised if one day you come in to cozy ambiance, and the next day, a bit of a zoo!  * Picky eaters be warned! Most of the kitchen staff's English is shaky at best, so keep that in mind when making modifications, or if you have special Dietary restrictions.  * Lots of vegetarian options! Vegans or people with gluten allergies may have a trickier time finding something that appeals, but there are some options. (On a related note: Pad Thai is NOT fully vegetarian/vegan and can not be made fully vegetarian)  * This is an Asian-fusion restaurant. If you're looking for pub fare (nachos, wings, fries), they have it - but don't have high expectations. Gravy or ranch sauce are not options.  * The pad thai is a best-seller for a reason, but there are lots of other great options! Sandwiches, salads, and pastas are all quite tasty! Sweet potato fries come as a side at no extra cost!  * Brunch is pretty tasty for the price, but only runs until 4pm. This is not an all day breakfast establishment! Eggs benedict. homemade waffles, and fresh squeezed OJ are only available on weekends.  * Expect to receive one bill for your group. This is not because servers are lazy, but because they do not carry their own float, and there is only one till. Multiple bills becomes inefficient and slows down service.   * Waitstaff seem to have the reputation of being too hipster to be good at their job - I beg to differ. Like anywhere, the servers will have varying levels of experience, but I can assure you, for the most part, they are friendly, hard-working, and take their job seriously. From someone with nearly 10 years of serving experience, I wouldn't have been able to tolerate working with a lazy team!  * Contrary to popular belief, Nirvana is NOT over-run with cockroaches. In my time working there, I have yet to see a single one. Seriously!   Nirvana is not a fine dining restaurant. It is also not a family restaurant, a sports bar, or a dance club. If you're into a laid back vibe, affordable food and drinks, and a bit of \"character\", you'll probably love it! Maybe I'll even see you there ;)"}
{"text":"only went for breakfast and it was so satisfying and under $10 coffee is bad but what could i expect  fresh orange juice too"}
{"text":"I've heard enough horror stories about the cleanliness here not to order food - but the beer is cheap. Same deals you'll find at Red/Green Rooms, Java House, and now Pour Boy.   We went for the Mill St. Organic which came out as any other pitcher would. Second pitcher was a different color. More orange. It tasted OK, but was not the same beer. They didn't believe us even when comparing a glass of each. Anyway, the beer is cheap. 13.95 for a pitcher. It wasn't the same beer, but I guess I'd drink PBR at that price point, too.   Actually, that's a bad comparison because I would pay a LOT for PBR. a LOT.  No air conditioning (or ineffective) - so hot nights...it's HOT."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes arrivés pour rejoindre avec un peu de retard un groupe assez conséquent. Une dizaine de personnes en somme. Nous avons eu l'idée saugrenue de vouloir commander quelque chose alors que certains de nos amis avaient déjà reçu leur addition. À la bonne franquette quoi.   Mais non, que nenni ! Vous êtes en retard, on refusera de vous servir, on ne vous proposera même pas le café, allez vous faire voir ! Voyons, l'addition est globale, le service est déjà inclus alors on ne dérogera pas, pas question de vous accommoder, on vous regardera de haut et on vous méprisera avec cette distance hautaine du hipster qui ne bosse que par obligation ...    Soit, nous sommes allés manger ailleurs."}
{"text":"Short form: butter chicken excellent, service slow, room cold.  A group of six of us went to Nirvana for an early dinner and we even made a reservation. It was not necessary. The restaurant has very ornate surroundings and one imagines an Indian prince finding it quite comfortable. He would, however, freeze his royal backside as the room temperature resembles that of a cave. We were seated promptly however the number of chairs set out for us did not match the number in our reservation. With only one reservation to handle one would assume it could be done to perfection vis a vis the number of diners. No worries, there were plenty of available chairs from which to borrow. We ordered a round of IPA's and waited much too long for their delivery. Sensing that it would be a long night, we were delighted to learn that a buffet would be available...in a half an hour. The IPA's kept us all occupied as we waited for the feast to be set out. At the appointed time (5:30 PM) all was ready and we grabbed our plates. The selection of samosas, fish cakes, and assorted chutneys complimented the few salad offerings. The mains consisted of  a generous tub of butter chicken, a spicy beef with bones dish, some dahl, two rices,and several other Indian dishes which I am unable to identify. In addition there was a selection of Indian sweets which we did not sample due to excessive butter chicken consumption! At our request the server brought naan bread to the table. All the dishes were very tasty and the spicy beef added a real hot punch.  Additional naan and beers took a very long time to arrive given how empty the restaurant was. The buffet was $ 16.99 each and no one left hungry."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night and I was impressed. The space is large so that tables have some distance between them. The beer is very reasonably priced for the area (Sneaky Dees-like prices) and I was happy to see that they had Tankhouse on tap. In addition, the chicken sandwich and lentil soup were very high quality for bar food and far surpassed my expectations given what you can usually expect from a pub."}
{"text":"* Service was great!  * Food was awesome!  * Prices are fantastic!  *Vibe was mellow and exactly what I needed  Definitely will be visiting again, in fact, this weekend!"}
{"text":"I've come here lots of times with friends. It's a nice place to go at night for a bite and drinks, or on a Sunday morning for a quiet brunch. The prices are great, they have a great selection of cocktails. They offer daily drink specials as well. It's nothing fancy, but fun to go out with friends or even a date. I've seen people of all ages here -- early 20s to late 60s."}
{"text":"Went to Nirvana for bunch with friends as we heard it was a great spot in the city. The atmosphere was pleasant and the food was well received by our group. We did have to wait over an hour for our food but we understood as it was Sunday rush.  The experience soon changed after the bill was paid. My friend decided to treat the group for the meal and proceeded to pay for all of us. Once she paid our waiter Steve came over and asked us how our service was and proceeded to tell us that she left  him less than 10 % tip.(At this point we were not privy to her tip as she paid at the front in private). First of all you have some nerve to come to the table and complain about your tip. A tip is reflection of your service, which was mediocre at best. It is poor taste when you staff comes begging for tips when they did nothing to deserve them as your staff is a reflection of your business. Maybe if he wanted a better tip he should have come to the table more often and maybe apologize for the delay in our food. I have been in the service industry for many years and have never ...I mean never been told by a waiter at any establishment what I should leave as tip. I would advise you  to retrain your staff, Steve in specific or replace him with someone who is qualified to do the job.  Lets just say I will not be returning to your establishment."}
{"text":"Hands down or up, this place is cool! I have been a few times over the years and it never fails to peak my interest. It also contains an eclectic mix of furniture and pictures on the walls that's not totally unlike an antique or vintage shop. Have I mentioned that it's also cheap as chips yet? Oh boy, bottled and draft beer is around five bucks, which means you won't have to eat ramen noodles for the rest of the week after hitting up this place on a Saturday night. It also has a wee patio in the front, which is great in the summatime if you manage to snag a spot. Inside, it's a huge open space with loads of seating so you'll rarely have to pick a fight with any of the other friendly happy patrons, which is a huge bonus because while black eyes are bad ass, fat lips aren't attractive.  Nirvana has a pretty good selection of Western and Asian fare and I've heard that my favourite meal of the day (ie. brunch) is quite nice. Once I can attest to this and me and my eggs bennie have become one, I'll be sure to let you know. With that said, I will definitely continue to frequent Nirvana in the hopes that one day I'll find my Kurt Cobain."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks.  Food was VERY poor quality.   Not a single member of our group enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Coffee is hazelnut....bad form.  but the pad Thai is the best!  I dont even look at the menu when I come here."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were just OK, but service was so bad. The worst part is they forced us to pay gratuity by adding 15% to the bill already. Gratuity is supposed to reflect the service they provide, and it's not worth 15% there at all. Plenty of better bars to go around that area, will never go back again."}
{"text":"how does the waitstaff here function without a helmet?   cheap shitty food with lousy service. but it's got a lot of seating so if you have a large group then this might be the place for you.   it is a cute looking place. suitable for drinks only."}
{"text":"My friend and I are apart of a travelling group, and they highly recommended that we try Nirvana the next time we were in Toronto. So we did. We actually met all of them for brunch and it was pretty nice.The sun was out (finally) and luckily the space was equip to bring in as much natural light as possible. Nirvana is no hole in the wall, but you could argue that it tries to be. It has your typical European cafe aesthetic, but just a tab bit more airy and bohemian. It was also large enough where you didn't feel cramp while dining with your neighbor. But enough about the building, the food was excellent. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Bagel w/ Sweet Potato fries and it was everything. The bagel was made to be a sandwich and it was dressed with capers, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, and of course the classic cream cheese. The sweet potato fries were good. There was nothing fancy or exciting about them, they were just...good. The only downside about this place are their drinks. I ordered the mojito and my friend order the Yellow Sangria, but  they both tasted watered down. Other than that, I would recommend this place and come here again."}
{"text":"Hello Martini Thursday!   I plunked down at Pearson and within days was sipped martinis with the girls in the mood lit wonderment of Nirvana. No, not the band but instead the blissful surroundings of a bar with a discounted menu.   Equation for success = white wine+French martini+French martini+great friends+reminiscing+good service+intimate but comfy seating  I love Toronto and am so happy that my new break onto the bar scene was graced with Nirvana's presence."}
{"text":"Nirvana is one of the better Indian restaurants in Calgary. In terms of decor, ambiance, food and service, Indian restaurants are usually one or the other, but this one seems to have it all.   I would say that this is one of my family's favourite Indian restaurants in Calgary. If you're a fan of milai kofta, naan, parantha, raita and lassi, Nirvana will not disappoint.   It's usually not packed, which I like, and usually the food is served rather quickly, again, which I like :)   I\"d recommend you take a trip over to Nirvana - your mind, body and soul will thank you."}
{"text":"Really great place. Cheap prices and big portions, would definitely check this out again. Very dark and had a great vibe!"}
{"text":"Out of the cold and into the dark, just off of College in Kensington is where you'll find this cozy little spot. I've read the other reviews and sure they seem to have a variety of good eats but after the traditional dinner hours the dim lights, eclectic furniture, light fixtures and tiny booths make for an ideal date spot for two OR a small group of friends.   The ambiance of this place was perfect for conversation, and just hanging out, and the air of 'chill' was heightened by The Beatles playlist that played in the background for the entirety of my 2 hour stay.  The cocktail offerings were also very unique, ranging from traditional faves like Tom Collins, Martini's and Mojitos, to coffee cocktails, Sangrias and those with a slight Asian fusion in them. The latter was the direction I went with my beverage choice and I ordered a fruity Lychee Cocktail made with real Lychee juice, mixed with a formidable measure of booze (it had some bite) and accented with an actual Lychee fruit - it was delicious and refreshing, certainly something well suited for summer time patio drinking.  Sangria pitchers seemed to be the fave at many other tables so I feel like this is a well known specialty for this place and definitely something worth checking out on my next visit.   What I thought was great about this spot is their weekly list of daily specials, which were all extremely affordable, including:   Martini Monday 5.95 Cocktail Tuesday single 4.50 double 5.95 Beer bottle Wednesday domestic 3.25 premium 3.75 Bar rail Thursday single 4.00 double 5.50 Fri/sat selected shooters 3.75 Sangria Sunday pint 4.75 pitcher 14.50  Definitely going to be back to check these out and fella's if you're looking for a good spot for that infamous first date this is a great pick and you'll save a few bucks due to their inexpensive drinks."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant last time I visited, but this time the food was mediocre.  We went specifically looking for vegetarian options.  Last time it seemed to really deliver.  This time it was blah and boring. Something called 'avocado' salad should be more than 4 skinny slices of avocado on top of dinner plate full of ho-hum mixed greens.  Lentil soup with coconut milk lacked seasoning. Deep fried tofu wasn't bad.  Sangria was good. Service was adequate but not friendly.  Maybe just go there to drink and take a pass on the food."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we meet here for a pre-Lee's-show dinner yesterday.   The other reviews are right: there is a LOT of seating here. And the food is crazy cheap. I had soup, a salad, and two drinks for $23 including tax and tip. What?! I didn't even know that was possible!  That said, you do get what you pay for (and I don't mean that in a snarky way). The soup and salad were decent, and as good as you can expect for those prices. They also have great drinks specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Another College and Bathurst Haunt ( I seem to spend alot of time here) It hasn't changed much since my student days. (Once a friend got kicked out for falling drunk asleep in one of the booths). Came here last week for a Brie and Avocado sandwich and a Chai tea.  Both were delicious and the prices here are very reasonable. I think it was $6 for the sandwich and $2 for the tea. My friend had a Pad Thai and that was pretty good (not authentic in the slightest though) and it was only $9. If you are looking for something not too fancy for a decent price, this seems like a decent bet."}
{"text":"This spot is the perfect little spot for cheap yet great food, servers are on the ball, even if your sitting in the corner out of sight. The food Is really good ( for the price)  Only issue is that it's very dark inside, had to use my cell phone a few times to look at the menu, my eyes did adjust after a bit!  Avocado and Brie sandwich is one of my favourite!! Pasta is okay, avocado salad is also really good, starting to think I have a thing for avocados :)"}
{"text":"I really like nirvana. There great for many things from flavourful americanos to delicious take out brunch to late night caps. They do it all! Service is very friendly and quick usually especially considering how busy they can be. I am never disappointed after going there or grabbing a quick drink or bite. It has an intimate inside with dark lighting making it nice for a catchup with a close friend or a date night."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a very delicious chicken sandwich with sweet potato they served. Everything were very fresh and perfectly cooked in a surprising price!!! The grilled chicken was pretty thin but I was ok with that (for this price, it is not a big deal) anyway I prefer more veggie than meat. You can't always count on reviews and you can't judge it with just one try. Hope they serve everyday like today and not disappoint me in next try."}
{"text":"Food is okay if you need a quick bite. It's cheap and plentiful, I'll say that. The mojito that I had was delish. Not too sweet and you can get 2 oz. cocktails for a little it extra-- it's really the better deal.  Music is always an eclectic mix and I think they happened to be playing Fleet Foxes upon this lovely August afternoon. I met a friend here for some drinks and a little pre-chat before dinner elsewhere.  The thing that pissed me off was that we were sitting right by the inside patio and there was no one else out there. A table of three people who seemed to have just finished their shift working there sat directly in front of us (despite the fact that there was lots of room everywhere) and began drinking, cackling and taking louder than the sirens on the street. No prob if you guys wanna rip it up and get loaded-- I've been there, but I don't plonk myself down directly next to the one of the only other tables in the joint. We ended up moving because it was just too much background noise and what they were talking about wasn't interesting enough to overhear.  It probably wouldn't have amounted to me even making a comment about it in a review but for the fact that they seemed like staff, which is a reflection on the place itself.  Overall, a solid place for lots o' drinks and a snack."}
{"text":"After waiting for over an hour to get our food, there wasn't much this place could have done to salvage the experience. I literally had to track down the server and ask why after ordering our food an hour ago and seeing multiple tables come in after us and eat, we still did not have our food.  The server assured us that it was being made now and would be at the table in 10 minutes. 15 minutes later, it finally arrived. Not worth the wait. My date ordered the wrap and stated \"it's so moist on the bottom, I literally can't pick it up\". My quesadilla wasn't much better and lacked flavour.  I can't recommend this joint for brunch and I hope you'll save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Great find on the Bathurst and College neighbourhood! Cheap prices, good food, service, and vibe! Never have had a dish I was disappointed in. The place is very eclectic and funny looking but it adds to the charm of the place. And is a great place to tune out and relax. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved to the college & bathurst area and this is one of our go-to spots. Every day drink specials and delicious tofu pad thai at $8 keep us coming back. Their brunch is impressive as well - cinnamon infused coffee, anyone?"}
{"text":"No variety in taste. The butter chicken tasted the same as the beef curry and chick peas. Naan was the best part."}
{"text":"Whatever. Cheap, studenty, breakfast and booze. Good patio but it's totally fine if you never end up coming here......you're not missing anything."}
{"text":"Limited menu options, but hearty portions and simple but tasty food for a low price. The eponymous sandwich is quite good, and served on a really airy roll. The hot sauce is very hot, and the coffee comes with cinnamon in it if you like that kind of thing (I do not!)."}
{"text":"My dodgeball team will often take the pilgrimage to Nirvana after a Sunday game, to take advantage of the $15 sangria pitchers. The food and the prices are 4-star, but the service my boyfriend and I received the last time we were here bumps it down to a 3.  I ordered the fruit and cheese plate, which was delicious. You could tell the fruit was organic and the portion was huge. I also ordered the butternut squash soup, which is usually very flavourful and tasty, but this time it seemed watery. I'm pretty sure my bill came to just over $10, which is a great price for what I got.  The service here ranges from almost acceptable to downright horrible. Sunday afternoons are usually fine; you just have to deal with indifferent waitstaff. Who would have guessed that the worst service I ever had here was on a Tuesday night? The place was packed with only two servers working, and what I can only assume was one chef. The fruit plate and soup (no cooking required) took over an hour to come out. The waiter was flirting with a girl in the back of the restaurant instead of taking plates or refilling water.  I will always come back to Nirvana, but probably not after dinnertime. If I'm in the neighbourhood after 6:00 I'll choose one of the many other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Totally forgot about this place, but made my way back there this past Sunday after a failed trip to The Fish Store (which apparently is closed on Sundays...oops!)  And...I forgot how much I love it!  Awesome on a student budget, or a recent-graduate budget.  I am always particularly fond of the brie and avocado sandwich, or the BLAT.  Sandwiches with a side come out to 5 or 6 bucks...a very reasonable price for the quality.  They also have reasonably priced drinks!  The patio was a great place to watch all the world cup festivities along College st...but it's also a good patio any warm summer day."}
{"text":"My colleagues came an hour late to meet me, so I was there on a Friday alone, drinking. The waiters were really nice to me, and joked with me. Once the others did arrive, the service was quick, the food was pretty good, drink options were not great, prices average. It's a nice, dark place to go with a group. It's big, it plays good music that's not too loud, and it's not filled with college kids."}
{"text":"went there for a dinner.   the menu has lots and lots of choices of yumminess. the prices are on a cheap side (pad thai is about $9). The menu is super diverse - there is thai food and pirogies and sandwiches and just salads.  my fave about the place is the atmosphere and decor. there is a feeling of coziness and relaxation. Dim lights and candles do help that too.  Loved the table booths they have all over the place. and cute little cornered tables.  the service was very attentive, friendly and very quick.  it seems to be a good place for bigger groups too as they have few big tables.  great place!"}
{"text":"Chaque jour il y a une promo différente et super avantageuse, comme les cocktails à $4.50 le mardi, la cuisine y est ouverte assez tard, donc toujours moyen de commander quelque chose tant que c'est ouvert. Les sandwichs ne sont pas extra mais les burgers et les quesadillas sont corrects. Toujours bon à savoir aussi il y a un ATM à l'intérieur si vous ne voulez pas traversez pour aller à la RBC.  BREF ! Un bar sympa à Toronto ou l'on peut boire et manger pour un prix plus que raisonnable !"}
{"text":"Love this little College St. gem to death! This restaurant just across from the infamous Sneaky Dee's has the best prices in town! I used to frequent this place so often in the summer months the waitress recognized me and I will be frequenting it again! This place has a pretty good selection of quintessential bar foods mixed in with a slew of Asian fusion dishes, giving this place a unique edge! The drinks menu is extensive, my favourite being the pitchers of sangria that they offer. Such an amazing price for what you get! The lighting is dim to match the lowkey vibe of the place. It's a good little spot if you just want to catch up with some friends over drinks and something to nibble on! This is always my first stop for drinks before wandering into the many other bars in Kensington and along the rest of the way! My only qualm is that because this is a place that typically draws larger parties than just 2, it would be extremely efficient if they could split things up and do separate bills. As someone who isn't particularly mathematically inclined this is always the roughest part of my night (especially with a couple drinks in me)."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is great for cheap and cheerful eats near U of T. I like their sandwiches and the stir fried glass noodles-plenty of vegetables and chicken and shrimp. Also like that most of their entrees come with a salad so you don't have to feel like you're missing out on your veggies. This place is big and expansive-a good student hangout or a good place to bring big groups in general."}
{"text":"I've been to Nirvana a few times and have enjoyed it each time. The food is good (I've had the BLAT sandwich, perogies and nachos), and I've been drinking there also. Their coffee is awesome - they brew it with cinnamon and started me doing it at home also! My only complaint is that the portions are a bit small and considering that, a tiny bit pricey. However, I will continue to go there and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Great Loungy Vibe...  $15 for pitcher of SteamWhistle... Daily drink specials (see attached)"}
{"text":"OH Nirvana!  This is one of my go to places when I just want a simple breakfast or dinner. Mind you, I live across the street, so I'm lucky.  I used to frequent Red Room, but once I found out about Nirvana, I changed my course. The feel and atmosphere is the same as Red Room. It's cozy and intimate. The decor is eclectic but not messy, everything fits together at this casual restaurant.   The patio is ideal in the summer and they have affordable drinks and food to match.   So get a friend or two and visit Nirvana, it's a great place to catch-up and unwind on a weeknight.  P\S: Try the avocado and brie sandwich or smoked salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries, both are my favorites here."}
{"text":"I like coming here with my friends just to have a drink or catch-up. It does get pretty busy during the weekend at night so it can get nosy. However they make great effort to check to see how you were doing and if they could get you anything else. Great prices on alcoholic drinks and food!"}
{"text":"A wide mixture of worldly foods - hearty and somewhat heavy - lots of flavors. Spiced and floors often different than what you might find elsewhere. Funky interior."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend and it was amazing! We got a decent amount of food for super cheap compared to other brunch places in Toronto (only $8-10/person). We got smoked salmon bagel and eggs benny - they were both so good, and they came with fruit too!"}
{"text":"OK Drinks, Slow Service.  We arrived with a group of 4 and grabbed a table. We waited 6-7 minutes before one of the 2 servers came to our table.  We ordered 2 coffees, 1 mojito, and a pitcher of water.  It took them 10 minutes to bring us our drinks.   The mojito was nothing special, I've made better at home  It took a while for our server to return to see if we needed another drink or refills. The place was hardly busy."}
{"text":"The only 19th century opium den I know with $6 wings! If you are on a date there, expect to be going dutch on the cab back to their place, or doubling on his fixie.  Also, somebody toss a urinal puck in that bathroom tho... PEEYEW!   Friendly owners! 4 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were planning to have brunch at another place around the corner that had a long wait so we decided to give Nirvana a try because they food looked great and they had lots of appealing options. Boy are we glad we did! We sat out on their very small patio in the sunshine, my mom got eggs over easy with bacon and a side of small fruit, I got smoked salmon on a bagel with capers and cream cheese and we shared an avocado salad because we were really hungry! Everything was scrumptious, both our meals came with sides of sweet potato fries which was a pleasant surprise. Not only was the food just right but so was the service, we had to servers looking after us and they were both extremely kind. The cherry on the sunday was how affordable everything was, we will definitely be back! Thanks Nirvana :)"}
{"text":"A charming, funky spot with outstanding food for the exceedingly low price.  Let us begin the the price point. You will spend more for a six inch sub combo at Subway than for the massive, intensely flavourful sandwiches you get here. Drinks are inexpensive and normally large, beer selection is actually quite impressive and true to the asian-fusion form, and even the wine is decent for the limited range and cheap price tag. Entrees are also quite good, from the pad thai to the lemongrass chicken and so forth, and it has to be maintained that nothing here will break the bank.  Which is a perfect as most of the clientele seem to be students, Kensington hipsters, and young business professionals who dress and act above their tax bracket, and with all that money spent on (respectively) textbooks, vintage clothes, and designer suits, how wonderful it must be to get a great meal on the cheap. The atmosphere is charming, eclectic, and welcoming as all hell.  An aside: get the curried eggplant dip as your app. It is DELICIOUS.  Night times are invariably, what is it the cool kids say now, bangin? It must take something special to deal with the outrageous heat this summer, though; three giant fans don't do much to ease up such a huge dark room when it's 35 degrees and over 90% humidity.  Servers are always friendly, always smiling, and with the exception of one skinny asian girl whose accent I can't place, always...relaxed in service. One of the other reviewers mentioned that the size of the room might make it difficult to keep tabs on everyone, and while that's a decent point, it only explains a slow first greet. That said, I'm never in a hurry and have never said to one of the servers, \"I'm in a bit of a rush\" so I've yet to see how'd they respond if I looked like I was, and the slow pace suits me just fine, especially since the drinks come out nice and quick and without even a raised eyebrow when I order a Cowboy (shot of bourbon and a short glass of milk - yes it tastes awful, yes it cures what ails you) at 11 am.  My only out and out let down with the place is that there is no seating at the bar. A, I'm a proper lush and nothing fits quite like slouching on the bar, and B, it looks stunning and would be a great place for said slouching.  In all, a great stop and one that will make you want to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atomesphere."}
{"text":"I like this place. Been here a couple times, always a few other people around. Its low lit, with candles, comfy seats and overall a cool vibe. Theres lots of seating options so large groups can fit. A good place for after work drinks or catching up with a friend.  The drinks are all reasonably priced, average $6. On Monday they have reduced price martini's ( $5.50). I've never had their food (yes too focused on my alcohol) but glancing at the menu I would say casual pub care. And again, reasonable prices.  I'm sure I will come  back here. Its a great place to just stop off at and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. The sangria is amazing and I love the variety on their menu. However, I did find the quality of their food average and the staff could be a bit more professional. Overall, good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Drove across the city in -30 degree weather because a buddy and I were craving buffet and we were not disappointed.  Now, I lived in India for a year so I am picky about a good butter chicken and this did not disappoint, the rest of the buffet was just as good!  For the two of us the bill was less than $40 and we walked out of there absolutely full and very happy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! It's a low key sit down dive bar that you can casually go to any day of the week. Food is good (and super cheap!) and drinks are also very reasonably priced! It's not too loud so you can still socialize!   Id recommend the Spicy Thai Soup for food!! It's surprisingly really good!! Sangria are also top notch and only $30 for a pitcher! Woo!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nirvana a few times. I have always been happy with the food but not so much with the service. I think a few people had complained about the service and I am happy to report a big improvement. This time around I have to say they improved tremendously in that department. The service was great. Fast friendly and very helpful. The food was fresh, delicious and plentiful in the buffet.  I asked for drinks and naan bread when I sat down. When I came back from the buffet, drinks were in the table and the sever was just bringing the fresh hot naan bread.  Service was great. I will be happy to go back."}
{"text":"Run by the same people who run The Green Room and The Red Room, Nirvana falls into the category of bar/restaurant with cheap prices all around.  Nirvana steps up the quality of establishment when compared to the above mentioned stores.  The environment is much nicer, the food is of a higher quality, heck even the staff is better (you actually receive service at a regular rate.)  From the food that I've had there, I'd have to say that their breakfast is good, and their nacho platter is great.  In regards to alcohol, they have this awesome apple beer (note: it's not a cider) that is always a treat and great alternative to the usual suspects of beer.  They also serve both white and red sangria, both of which are delicious if you're in the mood for that sort of thing.  On the whole, this is definitely a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"While the Saturday night shooters special is a great deal, the service and food leaves a lot to be desired.  They lost our reservation, and we had some of the slowest service I think I've ever experienced. One of our phones was stolen as well."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out - daily drink specials are a good deal.  The shrimp roll with rice paper is pretty bland tasting - it had a strange aftertaste to it. Have had better - make them at home and it will taste more fresh.  Burger was decent and the sweet potato fries were a treat."}
{"text":"Wow. Just left this place without service. Snobby, rude. Half the restaurant was empty and the waiter had the nerve to say we picked \"too large of a table for our four person party\". We sat at a table for 6. Relax. You're restaurant isn't busy at the moment anyways."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai, lots of seating and a little patio in the summer.  They have a surprisingly good breakfast for $5.  Eggs, 4 strips of bacon, sweet potato fries, texas cut toast and fruit.  I could do with some normal potatoes instead of the sweet potato fries though.  I'd give it a higher rating but not all the food is as tasty."}
{"text":"Totally decent food; service is a little slow at times.  I literally can't say it better than Ian P's review--you go because it's close and reasonable and no one will be disappointed.  The only time it's scored 'wow' points with anyone I've seen is when someone from Vancouver went with me, exclaiming how everything was so cheap in Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars on college street. Nirvana is a hotspot for Toronto urbanites. This is THE spot if you like to nibble on some tasty appetizers while taking down one-to-many beers. Always busy... expect to wait a bit if you are going on a weekend evening after 9pm."}
{"text":"While this place has a cool vibe with its eclectic decor, it might not be the place for the best food at brunch. I think it could be a fun place for drinks with a friend.   We had a large group, so I won't address anything to do with service or staggered meal delivery since Nirvana isn't really set up for large groups, and they were kind enough to accommodate us. The best: each of us was able to pay individually. Wonderful.   I started with a Caffe Latte. At first sip I was disappointed in the espresso. It was terrible. I love a good, fresh dark roast. This one tasted like it had been sitting in a coffee can for a year. And there were coffee grinds at the bottom of the cup. Yuck. The girls having tea laughed and rejoiced in their drink choices.    I ordered their Eggs Benedict ($9). The 2 eggs were perfect and the sauce good. What was odd was the ham. It was a small circle of ham the size of an average water glass bottom that had been cut in half and placed, one half per English muffin. I thought at first that it had been forgotten. Had to look for it.   It was served with plentiful sweet potato fries, ketchup and a spicy chipotle dip. A dish of fruit, containing 2 squares of melon, half a strawberry, a triangle of orange, a bit of apple and one grape accompanied the dish.   Overall an OK meal."}
{"text":"Great music, great drinks at amazing prices, what more do you want?  I walked by this place so many times and I have to say, the impression you get from the outside is totally different than the inside.  I am definitely glad we went in.  I haven't tried any of their food items as we went for drinks but a quick glance at their menu tells me this is a place where omnivores and herbivores can dine together happily.  I'm looking forward to going back for some food next time.  I love the vibe of this place.  It's comfy, relaxed, the servers are friendly and they play great music.  Its not so crazy that you can't have a conversation and it's not so quiet that people will give you dirty looks for being a rowdy group.  See you soon, Nirvana."}
{"text":"Decent priced beer and cider  Very chill ambiance. Lauren Hill was playing in the background and changed to alternative rock around 6pm.   Sandwiches were loaded and very delicious! Yam fries were crisp and tasty. The wedges were simple and flavourful.  Nirvana sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich: both priced under $10."}
{"text":"Friends have raved about this place so I finally went and wasn't impressed. The low lit zen like decor and the menu/prices are attractive, but the experience was ruined by inattentive, unenthusiastic staff. Had the spicy chicken soup which was good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I never think the food is amazing. For instance, I've never had a sandwich here that I've loved. Generally everything is just ok. (And the people I'm with usually agree.)  But the prices are reasonable and it's a pretty nice place to meet up with friends for a drink. Nice enough to come back to in spite of the not-so-special food."}
{"text":"This place has a nice interior and is a good place to hang out. Buffet options are very limited. However, they have good vegetarian options. The service is bad, the waiter never checked on us and we had to wait 5 minutes at the counter before we found anyone in order to pay."}
{"text":"Nirvana is a great little spot. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every meal was good, well priced and I left happy.   A few things that make Nirvana good:  - They have cheap pitchers of sangia - They have a patio (small) that is on the corner of bathurst and college - They have well priced sandies (seriously, i'm a sandy lover and can't deal with forking over 10 bucks for one)  One negative:  - the service is not so fast. don't go here if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here for brunch on Sunday. We ordered the pad thai, pesto fettuccine, bacon fried rice, and (personally) the fried chicken sandwich. We also ordered the white and red sangria pitchers.  The food was amazing!!! Extremely flavorful, well cooked, and served hot. The sangria was more of a miss for me. It tasted a bit watered down and wasn't strong enough. Our waitresses were extremely sweet, attentive, and friendly.  Our meals were also very affordable. I would 100% return!"}
{"text":"My worst experience in an Indian restaurant in town. The ambience was terrible, food was not tasty and the worst customer service ever. The food was buffet style, not warm at all, very greasy and cheap quality. There are way better options in town for Indian food.  Customer service was really bad, always chasing them to bring water or cutlery to the table and they only had tap water! Very disorganized dining room; overall I do not recommend this place and with 17$ per person for Indian buffet, you can easily find better options. I do not think the owner/management even care about their customer's feedback."}
{"text":"Nirvana is that pub that you go to on Friday nights after work with colleagues, not because it's great, but because it's close, the food is fine, and the beer is reasonable.  No one will be impressed, and no one will be too disappointed...it's a firmly average establishment with some hits and some misses.  The Drinks:  This place has an OK selection of beers, what I like to call the Mass-microbrews, places like Mill Street, Steamwhistle, Creemore, etc.  They don't have any of what I would call Craft Beer on tap though.  Beer pitchers are pretty reasonable though.  They also have very cheap shots (small ones, but cheap), that delight at least one of my coworkers who gets a little wild sometimes.  Wine is low-end, and I have to confess to never trying the cocktails.  The Food: Well, they do adequate food.  They're quite consistent with it, consistently average, but that's better than unpredictable.  The burger is a bit below average (consistently).  It reminds me of what might be served in an elementary school cafeteria and is well-acquainted with a deep freeze.  The fries are better, and I've had some decent experiences with some other menu items.  I like that they have a pretty good vegetarian selection, which is a plus for bringing a groups.  The Atmosphere:  It's dark, it's a bit loud, but it has some character.   The furniture only sort of matches, and it's all a bit quirky.  I think in the end I kind of like it.  Restrooms are in the basement and somehow get pretty gross even early in the night.  The Service: Ok, they're not consistent here.  I had one server who could barely hide her disdain at having to actually serve people in her job as a server.  She was nowhere to be found, and rude when she was found.  I've gone to the bar to retrieve drinks.  Then, I've also had some great service here.  My last meal in particular, the server couldn't have been better.  Either they have high turnover or need better management--I suspect both.  [I kind of wanted to answer \"sometimes\" to the question below on whether Nirvana had waiter service]  Overall, well, Nirvana is close to work and the beer is cheap.  I'll be back, but I think I'll avoid the burger from now on."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good and the yam fries are addictive but don't get the lasagna! I've been here a few times because it's good value as long as you don't mind shitty service.  Last time, the chair I was sitting in had a nail sticking out and it ripped my shorts - the manager just said \"oh!\" And then proceeded to do nothing. They are pretty understaffed and/or the staff are wickedly slow during weekend brunch. The food is decent but I don't think they're able to handle the number if people who come in on the weekends."}
{"text":"The aroma of curries and spices hits you as soon as you open the door. The large dining room is exotically decorated with traditional Indian motifs. This was the perfect stage for an Indian culinary adventure.   I went to Nirvana for lunch based on the recommendation of my coworker. The entire group had the buffet which seemed to be the easiest option. I tried every dish and was most amazed by the chaat, which you build yourself at their appetizer bar. I think of it as Indian poutine and it's freaking amazing.   However, everything else tasted lackluster, was barely lukewarm (isn't this a SAFETY concern?), and did not entice my taste buds for second helpings. Naturally, the butter chicken was the most popular item and although it was better than everything else, I've had better elsewhere. There wasn't much service and the server came by our table once during the 1.5 hours we were there. She refilled our glasses with water when we were putting our jackets on to leave.   Overall, Nirvana is impressive to the eyes but not to the taste buds. At $15.99 per person, the price was reasonable but there are better options elsewhere.   Except the chaat. I can't get enough of that stuff."}
{"text":"I came for brunch on a Sunday around 12pm. The restaurant gives off a vibe similar to Red Room, dimly lit and littered with mismatched furniture and light fixtures. Everything is a little dirty and worn down but spacious. I ordered their sausage and eggs (over easy) brunch and coffee, which came quickly enough. The coffee was hot but watered down. Sadly, the food is nothing to write home about either. Served with two half slices of whole grain toast, the eggs were a little over cooked and there was a small helping of cold yam fries. The side of fruit was almost pitiful; a drying half slice of orange, a small piece of banana, cantaloupe and one grape. At least the banana wasn't brown, I guess... I really don't think I'll be coming back for brunch. The only upside was that they had lots of seats available. Mars Food to their right probably does better brunch."}
{"text":"Nirvana is a cool looking, large restaurant with a large array of food options. Vegetarian lasagna, phad thai, spring rolls, cheap pitchers of beer, pasta... It's all a possibility here.   Nirvana: making magic, one mismatched table tab at a time."}
{"text":"Compared to it's scuzzy sister Red Room, this place is a princess, which I was pleasantly surprised to see when I visited one evening.  It's hip without the -ster on the end of it and seems to draw a crowd of cool people who don't have enough money to be total a-holes.   They've got a good menu with actual selection on it, and even though I'm sure the food is sort of hit-and-miss, the stuff I sampled while I was there was great.  They also serve all types of tea-- which for those of us who enjoy a good cup of chamomile will appreciate-- that comes in a fancy large mug."}
{"text":"It was an incredibly, gloriously sunny evening and I was on the hunt for a patio. I must've walked the stretch of College between Bathurst and Grace three or four times in my quest, and though I was tempted to visit Sneaky Dee's for the millionth time, I found myself drawn to Nirvana's promising patio.  I knew almost immediately that I'd made a solid choice. ($5 for a pint of Creemore? Amazing!) We were also a little peckish, so we shared a few items:  Sweet Potato Fries: These arrived to the table piping hot, and they were delicious. They were addictively crunchy, and the accompanying aioli was just about perfect.  Beet Salad (\"Baked Beets, Yogurt, Feta, Candied Pecans and Mixed Greens, with Citrus Herb Dressing\"): Again, this was far better than it had any right to be. The impressively large plate of food was thoughtfully put together, and the various toppings all worked really well together.  Cold Fresh Rolls (\"Shrimp with Avocado, Peppers, Chopped Herbs, Cucumbers, Carrots and Romaine Lettuce Wrapped in Rice Paper, Served with Hoisin-Chili Sauce\"): Okay, first of all, these were the biggest cold fresh rolls I've ever seen or eaten. They were basically the size of a burrito. And although they were perhaps packed with a little too much lettuce, they were nevertheless quite refreshing and tasty - especially when dipped in that delicious Hoisin-Chili Sauce.  Yeah, I definitely think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Good place to chill with friends. Its like those loud college bars where you get comfort food and just enjoy the buzz. Nothing out of the world yet a place to go to when you just want to have friday night drinks with dinner at a not so expensive place"}
{"text":"Came here for a beer and had an overall more pleasant experience than  expected. Drinks came at decent prices so no complaints. The Christmas lights and chandeliers decor also gave a nice touch without being intimidating, and water was consistently refilled throughout the night. Most of all, their food menu + prices looked promising, so I'll be back for those!   The verdict: Worth the trek out from UTSG. Much pleasanter than the bars nearer the university, which I'm sure only exist because students are geographically bound to them."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst indian resturants I have been to. The interior is nice and deceptive, but the food is taste less. The buffet menu is limited and service is bad. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I've instructed my girlfriend to remind me \"Dan, you really hate it there\" whenever I suggest in the future that we venture to Nirvana.  The bottom line.  It's hard to argue with the convenience of this spot.   Right on the corner of College and Bathurst.  Cheap food.  Cheap drinks.  People with nose rings.    But there's more than something missing.  The Avacado and Brie sandwich is delicious.   One of the best things in the city that you can buy for six dollars....   Every other piece of \"food\" on the menu is horrible.   The Nirvana chicken sandwich is grizzle and beak served on a baguette.   The only thing Asian about the Asian-inspired dishes is the SARS.  It's almost as if the two girls from \"two girls in a cup\" are the ones preparing the food.     Drinks are drinks.  They have a great spiced coffee menu.   They have a nice variety of cheap scotch.   They have that apple beer.     In the summer, there's a nice outside sitting area which is great for College street people watching.   In the winter, you're stuck inside with the cheap aesthetic of candelabras and urban barn furniture as you wolf down your beaks and eagerly await going somewhere else."}
{"text":"It appears that many of the cocktail bars in the Kensington Market area don't open until 5:00 p.m.  Since we were in the area in the early afternoon, it was a relief to stumble upon Nirvana, a bar/cafe with a nice cocktail menu and reasonable prices.  It was pretty busy in the middle of the afternoon, but we grabbed the last table near the patio.  The tables around us ate their lunches and drank pitchers of mimosas, but as for me, I came for the drinks!  Our waiter was a friendly, hipster-ly gentleman who recommended \"The Bicycle,\" to me.  The service was a little slow, but the raspberry grapefruit concoction was worth the wait.  I followed with the Watermelon Wheat beer on draft.  Holy summertime, just hook me up to a keg already.  I also had a few sips of the sangria (meh) and the Sunset, a cocktail of SoCo, amaretto and cranberry.  It took awhile to pay our check when we wanted to leave, but this was otherwise a total day drinking success!"}
{"text":"What's with Toronto and the lack of late night eats? All you can get after 11 pm is pizza in this city. Or maybe I'm just unexplored? Anyway Nirvana was serving until midnight and I'm glad I stumbled upon it. Owned by the same people who run Java Cafe, Green Room and Red Room (maybe more, but I'm not sure) the menu is slightly better then Java Cafe. The only other one of the bunch I've eaten at. The reason I recommend eating here is because it's cheap as hell for the kind of food you get. Most, nearly all, of the menu options are healthy. There's stuff for vegetarians, like me, and at the end of it you don't feel ripped off. If you can deal with intermittent, sometimes crappy service, everything else is fine. I never had the expectation of GREAT service going into a place as casual as this anyway. I can deal with it! Plus, if you're as sick of Sneaky Dee's as I am, go here. It's right across the street."}
{"text":"My co-yelper Sapna has basically covered the joys of Nirvana as a restaurant but I would like to cover it as a Banquet Facility.    We recently had a party to thank our workers within our association plus wanting to educate Calgarians on South Asian Food and Lifestyle so we turned to Nirvana.    The banquet hall and cocktail lounge is located downstairs, it is huge gorgeous space that easily sat 150 people.   Tables are elegantly set with beautiful tablecloths, table settings, crystal and shining cutlery.    The owner of Nirvana is a very young man, I believe in his late twenties but he was amazing in taking care of all our needs and was so present to negotiate and so flexible if things went astray.    The food and service was stupendous, I remembering entering and feeling full just at the food that was presented and then my co worker said \"Dinah those are just the appetizers! Wait till the main course comes\".    For the appetizers you can choice from 2 chutneys and 3 veggie starters which range from veggie items pakoras and tikki to somosas. The non veggie are many as well; lamb, chicken kebabs and somosas.  But the main contender that night was the main courses featuring the option of 50 choices: butter chicken, naan, masalas, pakoras, tikka, raita and goat and beef curry specialities.  And if you have that true party enthusiast in you Nirvana can throw in a DJ for your event and you can dance the whole night away Bollywood style. It was so amazing I learned to screw in the light bulb and open the door knob all night!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to go back there and - surprise - it was Martini Night!  I absolutely love Martinis, and they offer 5.75 GIANT martinis. Couldn't find a bad one. The Ferrero Rocher is AWESOME, try it, and again the staff has been so nice to me I have absolutely nothing to complain!  I asked for a simple salad with chicken, it was HUGE and very good. Chicken is usually overcooked everywhere to my taste because I like chicken a bit undercooked, but I should have said this before, not their fault. It's a ginourmous order and can be shared if you're not too hungry, and, see, I'm talking about a salad. Husband asked for a tuna sandwich that was served open due to its ginourmousity. Also very good.    Our side order was the traditional sweet potatoes, I'm starting to become addicted to this. Love them.   Yet their bathroom sucks and they don't have wi-fi. But the ATM is still there and the bill was very acceptable for the amount of alcohol and food we had."}
{"text":"2.5-3 Stars. Came here last night for a Birthday drinks and dinner thing. Drinks are inexpensive here for a Restaurant/Bar type place in Toronto. I thought the server was a bit rude, but he seemed to be okay afterwards throughout the night.   I end up ordering a Chicken Pad Thai since everyone in the previous reviews had good things to say about it. I wasn't a fan. Thought the noodles were bland, barely any bean sprouts. Learned my lesson to not order pad Thai at a non-Thai restaurant lol.   It's really nothing special in my opinion. Would've given it 2 stars if it wasn't for the decent drink prices."}
{"text":"Decent brunch, priced appropriately. Although the plates had some good aspects like fruit and salad, getting ketchup in a paper cup is kind of lame.  Went for brunch and there was NO LINE. That's hard to turn down."}
{"text":"Worst indian food ever.. Ambience is good.. But pathetic food.. Very bad service... In Short nothing worth eating.."}
{"text":"cheap drinks and good atmosphere, mediocre service, and me and my friend got food poisoning. probably wont eat there again"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out with friends. The lighting of the environment it dim but not too dark. They have alternative indie/rock music playing in the back ground and the prices of the food and drinks are average. The service is friendly and it's great for groups as well.  It's just an average bar that I would go to if I was passing by and I had no other unique plans for the night. You can't go wrong with Nirvana :)"}
{"text":"The Caramel Pecan Cheesecake is not that impressive compared to its price. It's like you get what you pay for. The sauce is so watered down. The topping on the cheesecake is amazing though...very smooth and delicate."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nirvana for a few years now, but was never a fan of their food really.  Kept going back, for dinner, for brunch, whatever, it just didn't measure up.  And the music was always too loud to talk comfortably.  That being said, I may have been addicted to their cheap Caesars night.  May have...  So I took a break for 1/2 a year, and went back last night for a staff party for the bar I work at.  I think I finally get Nirvana.  I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu.  It came with a small salad which came out before the entree, which was quite nice in form, but not very tasty.  The Pad Thai on the other hand was the best thing I've tasted there, and I've tried nearly everything else on the menu.  So unless the kitchen has been vastly improved while I was away, I think this is the thing to order there.  I also recommend the \"David Bowie\" drink - rum, coconut Malibu, strawberry-banana, and soda.  I usually don't like sweet cocktails, but this one was so good, I plan on ripping off the recipe.  This place is great for groups.  We were able to get a long table, with glowing candles, just perfect for passing around several bottles of Côtes du Rhône.  We had a fabulous night, with fabulous servers who made sure the bottoms of our glasses never went dry.  Even with it being \"Cheap Bar-rail Mondays\", our bill came to well over $500 for a party of 8 (dinner, drinks, bottles of wine), but this was a group of bartenders, and just speaking for myself, we can drink quite a bit more than ordinary \"civilians\".    Well done Nirvana!  Loving the improvements in service and food!"}
{"text":"so i lived in the area for a while, and for some reason, never went to nirvana.  I am jacks inflamed sense of idiocracy  The place is perfect for hang over, chilled out, meeting with friends, laughingness good times.   The place is quite big, and and it's a sit down bar. It's almost like the our old 'green room' on bloor, minus the bitchy asian owner and add a crowd of the same type, but plus 10 - 15 years in age.   The food is not bad at all, and very cheap. And most of the menu seems pretty healthy which i welcomed. But they still have your bar musts like the nacho's, wings, etc.  music is good, service is good, interior is hippy chill, beer selection on tap not bad. and bottled domestic beer is effing cheap at $3.50  love the character. still don't get why i'd never been here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Indian restaurant! And the only reason it doesn't get a perfect score is that sometimes the service is slow. Especially, when we order tea-- I don't know what it is about getting tea but it has happened to me about 3 times.   The atmosphere is decorated superbly! And almost gave me interior design fever. It almost looks like you've walked into a luxury hotel. There are items that look handcrafted and it is done in a tasteful India motif.   The crowd is definitely for families. And that makes complete sense because it is in the middle of the suburbs. The neighborhood should be dubbed Little India because you are surrounded by other Indian stores from meat shops, butchers, jewelry stores and clothing stores.   The food is really good and plentiful. I always make sure I have nothing else planned for the rest of the night when I go out to eat at Nirvana because you will be in a food coma! There are tons of vegetarian options to choose from (which is common with Indian delicacies) and the meat dishes are amazing as well.  My friends and I chose to do the buffet-- and we probably sampled everything that was there to offer. From the salads to the naan, the butter chicken to the curried lamb, and the dhaal (lentils)! I left completely satisfied and probably about 5 pounds heavier.   If you're worried about the spice-- you can throw that out the window. Everything spiced to perfection. Nothing too hot or too bland. I found everything really tasty.   I've heard great things about the hall located in the basement, but I have never attended any functions there. I know they have seasonal parties like New Years Eve and such, so I might have to check that out. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and wearing any not too constricting--- because you gon' eat a lot!"}
{"text":"Nirvana can be a little touch and go. I've been here multiple times over the years and received varying levels of service and food. They are far from consistent and it shows in their drink specials and food - they make a dazzling Mimosa, but their Sangria is very watered down and not worth the \"special\". Their Pad Thai is pretty good, their sweet potato fries are like crack and their perogies are legit. But the chicken avocado wrap is beyond meh and their standard breakfast is beyond 'buh'.  I was here twice in the Month of August and service was generally atrocious. The first time our server was inattentive and we had to flag him down multiple times to re-order drinks, and then he later forgot a drink order as well. And this was a relaxed Sunday afternoon with the patio basically empty and the restaurant even emptier.  On my more recent visit, a different server was just as forgetful and seemed nervous...and also had to return because he forgot my drink order. When I ordered food, I was brought the wrong order, and when I politely inquired why I received sweet potato fries as my side instead of the salad she awkwardly and nervously told me that \"it was probably a mistake from the kitchen.\" And then she stared into deep space...After I politely explained that I ordered salad instead of fries, she tried to argue with me. Like what? All she had to do was say \"Oh darn, sorry about that, let me bring you out your salad.\" It's really not that hard. Your kitchen, or server screwed up the order, and I asked like a nice lady would to have the order fixed. After 5 minutes she brings me a plate of salad.  And when we get our bill, she charges me separately for the salad as well as my main order they had screwed up. She charged me a dollar...and I was just like, you know what, this is dumb and I am not even gonna say a damn thing about this but ugggghhhhh, it was tres annoying and not cool.  If you're coming here for relaxing drink on their patio, then you might be in for a good time. Aside from that, Nirvana...surprisingly...blows."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with a few friends and we all had the buffet. It was okay, but I was slightly disappointed. The food wasn't very hot and there wasn't a very full variety of choices. The waiter pored us water but never asked if we wanted anything else. The buffet got empty quick and they didn't refill any of the dishes for another half hour at least. We waited quite awhile for our bill and it seemed like we weren't attended to even a fourth as well as the tables ordering off the menu. The food was okay but I'd say it was definitely westernized versions of the dishes(bland flavours).   Overall it was okay, but I've had better."}
{"text":"I felt like I walked straight into Punjab! This family-owned restaurant was a sight for sore eyes after traveling for over 10 hours. Their vegetable and aloo kulcha was the bomb. We also tried the vegetable chow mein (silly mistake for ordering Chinese at a true Punjabi restaurant!) - it was sweet-ish and nothing outstanding. But would totally go back for those kulchas and the paneer."}
{"text":"While the service is often lacking the food is always good! Breakfast or lunch, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I pretty much live at Nirvana. Its the perfect place to grab a not-too-quiet dinner solo, share an intimate catch up drink, or take over a long table with a whole bunch of friends. The menu is cheap and varied and satisfies many of my food moods.   I swear by the Thai style glass noodles ($8.95), which along with many of the other entrees, is served with an appetizing little starter salad. At a little more than a fiver, the avocado brie sandwich is also a quick tasty bet. For more decadent times and tastes, splitting a dozen Oyster Boy oysters with a friend can be an indulgently good time too.   There are a number of good options on the fairly big drink menu, but my friends and I always go for the house wine by the whole ($21) or half ($11) litre. If you like your drinks on the sweeter side, the unconventional sangria ($17.50) comes in red or white wine base and is served complete with fun-to-eat decorative fruit. On slower nights (which are becoming increasingly rare), the bar has even been known to indulge us in throwing together custom pitchers.  So if you're into dark candle-lit spaces with eclectic south-Asian inspired decor that serves good food and drink on the cheap and that are known to blast bands like Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Radiohead, then come on down and take a seat wherever you like."}
{"text":"Quaint, cool and cozy, this place is so laid back that I'm surprised it doesn't fall out of its chair.   I've only been once, but judging by the menu, they've got awesome drink specials every night. The food is also really well priced for what you get (I ordered the Nirvana sandwich), and I'm a sucker for good value. The one exception was the nachos, which had a serious lack of cheese and whose entire topping portion was dumped dead centre of the plate. Apart from that one letdown, this is a pretty solid place."}
{"text":"Hard to find when you are coming from the deep south, but worth the drive. We came here for a friend's going-away party and deliberated between buffet and a plated menu, and settled for the plates. We had a table of about 15 people, so service was understandably slow, but the food was delicious: I had butter chicken with the usual basmati rice and naan bread, a delightful treat. The interior is also quite pleasant, dimly lit with beautiful decorations."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the offering and ambience of Nirvana. The restaurant exudes a nightclub lounge vibe whilst combining an intimacy that affords conversation.  The food options cuts through impressive vegetarian options, Thai food and tasty salads. My Pad Thai was awesome and the 'Disco' cocktails were sublime. Yes I was drinking huge slugs of vodka, Malibu and Mango juice, but at $6.75 I was in my element. Service was quick and attentive and I would definitely recommend this fabulous eatery and bar."}
{"text":"Very average marks for this place all across the board. Mostly appeals to students as the food and booze are both quite cheap.  They have a small patio and lots of seats indoors.   Half liter of house red is only $11 which is a steal. Giant sized cocktails for $5.75.   Service is hit and miss, you'll be seated quickly enough but often have to flag down a waitress to place your order as they tend to forget about you.  Dark and a bit dingy inside, but it's all part of the \"charm\".  Good place to eat when you're drunk, but I don't recommend eating it whilst sober."}
{"text":"Waited at the door for about a whole minute and a half while servers made a point to avoid looking over at us. No sign that says \"seat yourself\" so we stood around like idiots, warming ourselves before heading somewhere else to spend our money."}
{"text":"The food gets about three stars, but four stars for the overall place because the food is decent enough, the wait stuff, though ultra-hipstery, are actually pretty nice and accommodating, the space is huge, and it's CHEAP.    I went for brunch and had eggs bennie. It was fine... nothing mind blowing, but good enough that I'd go back and order it again. I couldn't believe our bill when we left. I've become so accustomed to shelling out 20-30 bucks for a meal anywhere in Toronto (regardless of quality) that I had given up hope of find a decent place to get a bite with a friend and not break the bank or get botulism.   There's a definite laid back, young and hip vibe here, but it didn't seem pretentious as many TO restaurants are. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem located just down the block from Aunties and Uncles. Went to check out breakfast there, but the line was too long and we were in a pinch for time. Luckily, we found this place which served an AMAZING breakfast with simple, healthy, and fresh ingredients. I was truly surprised and satisfied with my meal and was left full, but not with the sluggish feeling associated with a big meal. Definitely put this place on my list of go-to's for my next venture in Toronto."}
{"text":"Touching most surfaces here leaves you feeling like you just vigorously scratched a dog, but the pad thai's alright and the drinks are cheapish. Nice dark interior - a good place when all you can do is Caesar the Day."}
{"text":"For some reason I feel like my brunch standards are significantly lower than my dinner -- heck, even lunch -- standards. The spirit of brunch is embodied by apathetic servers, mediocre coffee, and average food, no?   After shivering mercilessly standing in the lengthy brunch line over at Aunties and Uncles, my friend and I decided to ditch the wait and headed over to Nirvana instead. We were greeted warmly, seated in a booth, and granted a blessed reprieve from the biting cold outside. I ordered a hot water with lemon and a Spanish omelette, which came on a plate loaded with toast, sweet potato fries, and a cup of fresh fruit. Portions are generous, prices are reasonable (a meal for two came to around $21 with tax and tip), and service is actually quite friendly and attentive.   For a  \"greasy spoon\" type brunch spot, Nirvana met my expectations completely. Maybe not the greatest place for a nice sit-down dinner, but I wouldn't mind coming back to feast on breakfast foods while the suckers outside Aunties and Uncles stand in line!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for chandeliers... it may sounds silly but they have a way of making any space classy or in this case slighlt mysterious. I went to Nirvana for the first time with a group of friends for a bithday and I have to say that I theroughly enjoed my meal.  I at the smoked salmon salad a Pesto Pizza and and 2 Art Deco cocktails, my husband had 3 beers and a giant heap of nachos and the bill came to less than $60 which is cheap in my opinion! Everything was super yummy and as I mentioned earlier the atmosphere was nice.  This would be a great place for a first date or in my case hanging out with good friends. Many people in our group were vegetarians and it was nice to see that the menu had enough variety of both carnivore and veggies alike :-)"}
{"text":"Lately I've been back and forth about the Green/Red Room & Java properties. Nirvana, however, has escaped my judgment because I have never had a bad experience here.  Cheap and delicious food, cozy environment, nice staff and good beer. This is literally all it takes to make me happy, and Nirvana makes me happy.  It's also noteworthy that they have drink specials every night of the week! I told myself to have a Caesar Sunday one day (the one Caesar I had was delicious), but truth is, I can't drink more than two of the things before the acid in the tomatoes drives my stomach nuts.  Anyway, Nirvana is a great place to grab some cheap food, or to meet friends for drinks. Have the Avocado Brie and you will love life. Add a soup and it'll be even better. And the Pad Thai maybe tastes a little ketchup-y but it's still damn good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for breakfast! Got the sausage and eggs breakfast with a coffee and was pleasantly surprised. Coffee had a pinch if cinnamon in it which was really yummy, the bread for the toast was thick and tasted like it came straight from the bakery, the breakfast sausage wasn't overly fatty, and the yam fries and chipotle dip were delicious. Ended up coming here because there was a line up at Aunties & Uncles, but I would definitely come here again. Also the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"When I was in Kuala Lumpur, my friend and I stumbled into an opium den disguised as a hostel. Nirvana always reminds me of this place -- minus the naked hippies doing yoga and the magic mushrooms fermenting on shelves.  The lighting is dim, Buddha stares at you while you eat and when it's dark they bring the candles out. Also, the small patio looks out onto College Street, which is perfect for spying on passing pedestrians. Nirvana has a good ambience and the crowd is eclectic.  Pad Thai. I've eaten so much Pad Thai in my lifetime and I think they do a good job with it. BUT: They are stingy with the shrimp. I always pay extra to get mine with shrimp and chicken, but every time I'm given only two pieces of shrimp.The shrimp is good, but I always want more! MORE!!!  Pierogi. Oh God, don't get me started. I'm Polish so I have very high Pierogi expectations. These pierogi do not meet them. Clearly they were bought really cheap, came frozen and are doused in fat. They don't taste like pierogi at all. And the cheese inside tastes like it was made in a factory. Not to mention, the portion is tiny so you'll have to go for a burrito afterwards.  Sangria. Don't order it.  I will finish this off on a positive note: SAPPORO ON TAP. HELL YES!"}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly accomodating a last-minute Friday night large group, and the food was pretty firmly on the better side of mediocre.  Mostly highly rated for the atmosphere of comraderie amongst everyone eating there (or in my case, waiting in line for the ladies' room) and the far-out decor."}
{"text":"Very rude waitress - she refused to serve drinks after I showed her my Israeli passport. Just because its right to left, or because you don't like the country, doesn't mean you can throw people out like that"}
{"text":"Maybe this is 2.5 stars.  Got plate of nachos and pitcher of Creemore for $24 or so before tip.  Lets just say I don't think we got more than we paid for.  Its a college hangout, maybe I'm expecting too much.  I might try other food, maybe not."}
{"text":"I spend far too much time at this place, which may make my review a little biased, I'm not sure, but I can definitely say I LOVE Nirvana, as does everyone I've ever taken there.   I've been for breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, brunch, dessert, you name it; and I don't really have anything bad to say. The service is great (normally overstaffed by friendly ultra-hip twenty-somethings), the food is super inexpensive and served in generous portions, the drinks are delicious, and the decor is lovely.   Their recent patio addition is really great for people watching in the summer, as is their white wine sangria! As for the food, the sandwiches are all pretty yummy and I really love the pad thai.   All in all, I feel like there's something for anyone and everyone at Nirvana!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. You just seat yourself when you enter. It can kind of be confusing since there isn't any signs stating if you should wait to be seated.  It's a very laid back place and kind of dark, which I don't mind. I just love the atmosphere.  As for food, my friend and I shared the fresh shrimp rolls. It was OK. I found they put way too much lettuce in it and it was just too large. Couldn't really enjoy it.   I ordered the Pad Thai with Tofu. It wasn't that bad for the price. What else do you expect for $9? It's better than going to Thai Express though.   My friend ordered the Nirvana sandwich with sweet potatoes and she enjoyed it.  The service was pretty good, too.   I would definitely return to this place. Great prices and decent eats."}
{"text":"Such A good brunch ! We supposed to eat at aunties and uncles, but it was closed. So we found this place by chance. And what a surprise. I was really sad not to try the other one, and I really wanted a good brunch. It was a really good brunch :) not so expensive at all."}
{"text":"They are getting 2 stars because the food was half decent at least. Ordered on skip the dishes. The delivery time fluctuated from 50 minutes to over an hour and then jumped down to 20 minutes out of nowhere. So we weren't even ready for dinner when it arrived. We ordered 2 Diet Pepsi for $3 each and expected 2l bottles at that price. Nope. 2 cans and they were ice tea. When I called there wasn't even a manager there to speak with. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheep and cheerful. The food is good for the price.. the service is ok.. the music is too loud."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken ever.  Went for dinner on a Wednesday and only one other table was occupied.  I didn't notice a crazy wait... it was reasonable, but then again there was really no one else to serve haha.  The Aangan Ki Khaas Tikki appetizer was a tasty start - I especially liked the potato patties in it. I cleaned off the plate of butter chicken and used rice to soak up all the curry. Really good. The other dishes I tried were just average, but go get the butter chicken!  It was a little hard to find for me as it's in the corner of a shopping complex and not facing the main road."}
{"text":"Prices are good, food and service are average, portions are big and décor is eclectic. Something for everyone on the menu.   I don't feel the need to return but it was fun to try. Seating options are booths or tables. Reservations not required."}
{"text":"I was in the area and met up with a friend who was in the mood for Indian and she heard good things about the lunch buffet, so, on a whim we went.  It is tucked into a plaza in the heart of Falconridge, surrounded by what I could only describe as little India, it was bustling with people going into shops ranging from sweets to jewelry, clothing to law firms!  It is a beautiful restaurant, relatively clean, and the fountain was lovely, however the there was only one server helping customers which was ok but as others mentioned, the water brought was room temp and the glasses cleanliness was up for speculation.  The naan was absolutely divine, I would die a happy person if I could eat basket upon basket of that buttery, doughy goodness.  But that was about it, with exception to the rice and naan, the food was definitely not fresh.  The pakoras tasted reheated, the butter chicken was a gloopy mess of chicken remnants swimming in oil, chili chicken was just ok, the spicy fish  could be compared to over cooked fish sticks in hot sauce, the vegetarian options were lackluster at best, although the paneer dish was alright, otherwise the food was just meh.  There were several other options that just didn't tickle my fancy so I steered clear.  I tried the two of the sweet offerings and was underwhelmed, the gulab jamun was overkill on the sweet side, like diabetes on a plate, no real flavour of cardamom or rose in the syrup or pistachio garnish- just balls of dough swimming in a sugar bath.  And the Kheer had carrots grated in it and was very runny, nothing aromatic, mostly milky and sweet with no real depth of flavour.  For $15.99 I was expecting better, most likely won't go back with so many other options in the area. 2 Points for the ambiance and naan."}
{"text":"I think I was one of the first patrons Nirvana ever had. They've been serving up cheap sangria and beer with decent food for about 6 years now, and are right around the corner from my old place.  I enjoy their fried tofu and avacado sandwich, both very reasonably priced, but neither really wow. Others seem to enjoy their Pad Thai, but I've never sampled it. This place is more about reasonably priced drinks and large tables for group gatherings.   The major downside to Nirvana is the service. The servers must pool tips, because no one tries to impress. Either that, or they're all suffering from some serious hipster-itis. (A disease that has been sweeping Toronto for about 5 years now.)  MUST MENTION: Their small front patio is great for people watching."}
{"text":"Location: Bathurst & College, Toronto Item Ordered: Pitcher of Red Wine Sangria ($14.50)  I went this venue solely for the sangria Sundays that BlogTO voted as their top 5 sangria spots. Try worse. Watered down, too much sour citrus flavour, just not good. Although it may be the cheapest pitcher in the city, I rather put in a few more dollars for something decent.  I do not reco their sangria."}
{"text":"The butter chicken sauce is incredible, the service is always great and the food is always displayed with quality. Very good"}
{"text":"Brunch wasn't exactly mind-blowing in terms of taste but good value for the portion size.  The entrees and late night snacks are a bit better.  Pretty good atmosphere."}
