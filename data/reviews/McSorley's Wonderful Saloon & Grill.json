{"text":"Our family loves going to McSorley's. Our toddler always has a great time and the staff is friendly. Good variety on the menu and a lot of food for your dollar.

We often go weekly and the bacon for brunch is perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I heard good things when I moved into the neighbourhood, but for the first visit with my girlfriend we got a couple of sandwiches and they were both completely inedible. Greasy, over-cheesy, oily messes. I love cheese, and this was the first time I've ever said \"wow, this has too much cheese on it\". It was really gross. 

Again, I've heard some good things, but there are too many good places on Bayview to bother going to a place that can serve that kind of sh*te."}
{"text":"Great wings & ribs! Very pleasantly surprised. Meaty, lean wings (full wing) with BBQ char - much much better than standard wings from the fryer. Amazing draft beer selection; never would have guessed it from the outside. Very reasonable prices too! Highly recommend for a very casual dinner to catch the game.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to McSorley's with a small group to catch some Sunday night football. 
For starters, the environment is quite nice. Not the largest of establishments, but it had a good amount of TV's, a bar and really felt like a place you could go to to just kick back and relax. Plus, there were buckets of free peanuts available to snack on while waiting for the order.

Regarding the food, I had heard great reviews from friends regarding the wings so it was a no-brainer to order them. I ordered a pound of the butter chicken flavour and the onion \"chips\". Others at my table got the hot wings and honey garlic. All in all though, I have to say I was disappointed. The menu clearly did say the wings would be a bit on the \"burnt\" side - but the charred flavour overwhelmed any hint of butter chicken flavour on the wings. The honey garlic ones were moderately better, but not by much. The wings were also super greasy, more so than any I've had before, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. The onion chips were pretty good, basically a modified version of onion rings (same concept, different shape). Didn't have any drinks so can't comment on that.

The service was fine. Nothing spectacular but nothing too shabby. 

Overall, decent place - good environment, but food was subpar. Small sample size, but if I came back I would try something other than the wings."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot to catch a game with friends. Classic food, peanut shell on the floor, good beer."}
{"text":"Great burgers, reminds me of many Texas burger joints were its more about the burger than the atmosphere. That said, the atmosphere is just fine by me. Ultra casual, family friendly !!!!"}
{"text":"delicious food, casual place and people are always having fun. Good for family or group. everybody really friendly. my recommend  is thanksgiving dinner. IT WAS AMAZING."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I wouldn't serve this food to my dog or worst enemy.

I am a local in the area and I have been here on multiple occasions. I knew the food was mediocre - but I had no idea how horrendous it truly could be.

Appetizers:

Calamari - Soggy and Cold - no taste. 99% batter. We had to send this back.. it wasn't edible.

Deluxe Burger w/ fries - The burger was cold and stale - they used turkey bacon and the fries were just like the calamari. I only ate half of it because I was starving.

Coca Cola - I ordered a coke and it came to the table flat. I told the waitress and she had a hard time believing it. I know what flat coke tastes like! I was a bartender for 5 years - i'm not tyring to be difficult! I even saw their bartender pour them selves a coke and spit it it out - I had to tell the waitress that in order for her to believe me.

This place is going into the ground - the food and service is HORRIBLE. The only reason they stay afloat is because of the 15 regulars who come in everyday and drink their livers dead.

I recommend you do not eat here."}
{"text":"Love McSorleys for the atmosphere and friendly staff, one of the only places you see the owners out in the floor working and chatting with people. Best place to go for an afternoon game to eat wings and drink some beers, shelled peanuts included!! Like most other reviews, food is so so but stick with the specials and pub grub like wings, chicken fingers etc. and brunch is quality food, enjoyable on the patio in the summer.

We get the emails telling us about the theme nights like rib night, where they're cooking on the charcoal BBQ out on the sidewalk, or oyster night, the owners shuck em for the patrons. Great idea and good job creating a neighbourhood atmosphere.

Pretty much my go-to for Sunday football.

Good up the good work!"}
{"text":"I used to be a semi-regular at this place when I lived in the Eg and Bayview area. I was introduced to it by a friend that grew up in the 'hood, and I really enjoyed coming here. 

As a previous reviewer said, the staff is awesome. The food? Not so much, but it's adequate, and I used to love going to the cheapy Wednesday night Steak Night.  The crowd is really friendly, and relaxed, but that's sorta what you get in a neighbourhood watering hole, since it's a bit off the beaten path.  It's a great place to catch the hockey game, or whatever sport you're watching. 

It is good enough to say \"I miss it\" now that it's no longer my neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"Three stars, and they all go to the bar and wait staff.

THE BAD

If I were rating the kitchen/food, they'd get zero stars.  Or maybe a half.  The new menu is a nightmare, and as I said on ubspoon, the vast majority of it is frozen, reheated crap.  But that won't stop the kitchen from brutalizing whatever you order.  I particularly enjoyed my (daily special!) lasagna which was scalding hot until I got to the cheeky frozen centre.  You are a silly, silly sausage if you eat food here.

Besides, if you do eat here, you increase the chances of having to sit down in one of their restrooms.  They are cold, damp if you're lucky (wet if you're not), and generally vile.

THE GREAT

This is an amazing BAR.  Bar, as in, let's line up some Jagermeister shots (ice ice cold from their crazy machine).  Let's have one of those awesome double Caesars with the spicy bean in it.  Let's try to work though the beer list that ranges from the crap (Bud Lime) to the creme (Guinness, etc.).  For drinkin, they don't come much better.  Bartenders and servers are pros; cute, speedy and nice.

Like sports?  This is a great place to follow the action on NFL Sunday.  Bijillions of hidef screens.  Great place to catch late, left-coast MLB games.  And if you want to watch the latest edition of the Leafs Meltdown, this is Hockey HQ.  Pool table and some vid games in the back, if you dig that sort of thing.

So, in conclusion, it's an AWESOME bar and a MONUMENTALLY BAD restaurant.  Remember that..."}
{"text":"awesome sheppards pie! great to watch a Leafs game and awesome staff.. perfect ma and pa shop!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. Staff is great (with the exception of one waitress who is perpetually in a bad mood). Food is solid, I would recommend the lobster and Brie grilled cheese or the Cajun chicken sandwich. Best wings in town (they are grilled)! 

Large selection of beers at standard prices. Also, free peanuts!"}
{"text":"Fairly standard. Free peanuts for all. Boozy waitresses and good service. 

That's it. Haven't had the food so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit dirtball, with a twist of neighbourhood pub and local sports bar all rolled into one. It's like your old high school pal who isn't all fancy pants but would still do anything for you. You love McSorleys because it is what it is and they do what they do well.

Stick to the pub grub on the menu and you'll be fine. If you want Nachos, Beer and Wings, you're in the right place. 

Service is efficient and friendly and they make a point of chatting to their customers as opposed to gossiping amongst themselves. They don't make their servers follow corporate checklists and introduce themselves or any of that phony crap. Because they're real people serving real people.

This place is a neighbourhood gem. I just wish it was in a neighbourhood closer to me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a crappy restaurant with staff who offer nothing but attitude and pay 15 bucks for a 3 dollar meal of horrible quality , then go here. Awful restaurant and awe full food at outrageous prices. Been there a few times and gets worse every time."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich, was tasty.  Food is simple and good, nothing too fancy.  Would definitely go back again to try other things on the menu.  My friend had the double hamburger which was good and HUGE."}
{"text":"A unique dive bar!  Love the look and feel of the place.  Free barrels of peanuts and shell covered floors make it feel casual and fun. The food is good but I do find it over priced."}
{"text":"So much charm in this neighborhood bar. Service is great. Always friendly. what you see is what you get here. Food is good. 4/5. Drinks are cold. great place to watch hockey games. You get free peanuts and get to throw the shells right on the floor."}
{"text":"McSorley's, as most other reviews note, is a kitschy local pub. Most patrons are regulars. In the early evening there are usually many families with kids in for an affordable dinner out. Friday would be their most popular night- it is usually quite busy. TV's are everywhere & you can watch the sporting event of your choice (Leafs, Raptors, Jays & NFL football games are usually played with full sound). All the staff are friendly & helpful. Lots of beer on tap- probably a dozen or more varieties. Bottled beer is kept on ice- I particularly enjoy that. Free salted peanuts- throw your shells on the floor. As to the food- it is what it is. Since a change in ownership in 2016, the menu has changed several times, unfortunately for the worse, but you can still get acceptable pub grub. Wings are still grilled & are still good. Pizzas have also remained on the menu & they are also pretty good. On Fridays they have homemade curry (chicken, lamb & beef- rotated weekly)- it is excellent. Once a week (Monday or Tuesday- can't remember) they have \"Burger Bar\"- much, much better than their regular menu burger (why not just have burger bar every day & get rid of the \"normal\" burger???). Wrap sandwiches seem to remain popular, although I haven't tried them. There is also a steak night (decent for the price) & on Saturday they have Mexican night- tacos, fajitas, etc... In short, McSorley's serves decent/ average pub food. You shouldn't be going to a bar like this expecting gourmet food- you get basic pub fare, as it should be. As mentioned in a couple of previous reviews, McSorley's is like a second living room for local Leasiders. A place to watch the game & have a few pints with some wings if you're hungry. Five stars because it is what it is- a local sports bar/pub & service is excellent."}
{"text":"McSorley's is kitschy, crowded, cluttered, and noisy ... and I love it. It is a quintessential neighbourhood pub, where I can go by myself to decompress, watch a game or read a book, and feel perfectly comfortable. Or, I can go with a crowd of old friends and feel just as comfortable. McSorley's is that sort of place.

I make several stressful visits every year to Toronto, for family reasons, and McSorley's is just a block from where I stay. The cheerful waiters have saved my sanity more than once.

The chicken wings are to die for. The burgers are great. The draught is fresh and cold. The food is much, much better than it used to be. 

In fact, I've just talked myself into going down there tonight, to watch Game Six. Go Sox!"}
{"text":"Beyond the mediocre food and beer offerings, watching the middle aged male staff take deliberate trips to take lengthy, super creepy looks at my sister really made me kinda sick and uncomfortable. I hate to think what these guys do when they're not working. This isn't something I'd normally notice, it was just so blatant and gross. If you want misogyny at its finest, STOP BY! There's a reason I never came back. Get it together losers."}
{"text":"One of those places that is actually pretty terrible, but something about it is so great that you just keep on going back.  FOR LIFE.

The wait staff and bartenders are super friendly and recognize practically everyone (since probably 90% of their clientele are locals who have been going here for decades).  Beer's good, cold, cheap, one time I got sick after drinking some of their draft, but that was only once out of like 200 times I've been there, so whatever, might have been a fluke!  It didn't stop me from going there anyway!

The best food I've had there is when they do their BURGER BAR, where you can customize a fresh, huge burger with whatever toppings... It really was good.  Otherwise, the food is hit-or-miss.  Their wraps and sandwiches are fine; sweet potato fries are good; steak is okay; everything else is so-so for me... it's not bad, it's just not great either.  I think a lot of their food is prepared from frozen.  Again, though, nobody minds and the place is always PACKED, especially when there's a sports game on... which is practically always.  Most people there just want to drink beer, eat some greasy food, watch the game, and yell-talk with their friends.  This place is MADE for that.

They have a barrel of free peanuts at the front with self-serve plastic bowls... I guess this is part of the place's \"charm\" - it's kind of gross really but nobody cares that there are like hundreds of peanut shells ALL over the floor constantly.  That is probably one of those things that they should probably eliminate, but, again, WHO CARES lol.

The decor is super sports bar tacky, every possible surface is covered with some beer banner or sports logo, or weird framed picture.  There is stuff EVERYWHERE.  It looks like Don Cherry threw up on himself in terms of decor.  However, I can't really picture it looking any other way.

I think this place is a borderline religion for the staff and for the local Leasiders who frequent it regularly.  When I lived in the area I certainly treated it like it was my second living room.  Despite my criticisms in terms of the food and the decor, this place is basically an indestructible business, seemingly, and you could also probably show up wearing pyjamas and nobody would bat an eyelid.

++ Great place to watch a Leafs game.  It must have like 30 TVs in there."}
{"text":"This place is family friendly fun! The atmosphere is relaxed, televisions are located around the place playing various sporting events.

It's one of the few places that I know in Toronto that serves complimentary peanuts which you retrieve yourself at the door (how fun!). I wasn't going to have a drink but couldn't resist their unique cocktails and enjoyed every sip.

They have a varied menu. My cousin ordered sweet potato fries with a to-die-for aioli, made me wish I had ordered some as well. I ordered their baked mac-n-cheese which was creamy on the bottom and crispy on the top. It was so good it didn't last very long. The accompanying salad was fresh and crisp! So delicious!

My cousin ordered shrimp linguine (?) and although I don't like shrimp I can sometimes still enjoy the look of a shrimp dish. This did not look appetizing but my cousin reported that it tasted good.

Price point was reasonable and servers were friendly. I highly recommend this place as a place to try with a group of friends or family."}
{"text":"Just awful. I had the money chicken sandwich, the sandwich was soggy and the chicken tasted like rubber. The only thing worse than the food was the service. A total waste of money!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub. Nothing fancy. But usually a fun time for all. The old-fashioned barbecued chicken wings are to die for. Not to mention the great pad thai."}
{"text":"So we checked out McSorley's on a Monday with some friends who highly recommended this Bayview dining spot.

About the food --
- we had the Monday special burger deal -- and it is an incredible deal.  Burger and fries for 10.99 and it is a homemade burger with just about whatever fixin's you want -- bacon, different cheeses, fried onions, you get it!

- we also tried their smoked chicken wings.  I was not sure about these but am a total convert.  Soooo yummy!  Give them a try!

About the restaurant --
- very kitchshy - big bin of peanuts in the shell.  It's HYS (help-your-self) and then shells all over the floor.

They always have some beers on sale and drinks are very reasonable.
Decent sized patio space.
TVs are played sports events.
Seating is a bit cramped and not sure if it is fully airconditioned.  They had a big fan next to our table in teh back.
Parking is on the street but GreenP parking behind the TD Bank is much more reasonable.  
Check it out!"}
{"text":"It was a bright, sunny day and we were feelin' the need...the need for a patio.

We passed a bunch on this stretch of Bayview, but the one at McSorley's seemed the most appealing. And indeed, we managed to get a table that left me in the sun and my dining companion in the shade. Perfect!

We decided to share a couple of things:

Greek Salad (\"romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, bell pepper, black olives, feta cheese & Greek dressing\"): I wasn't expecting much from a Greek Salad, but this was definitely one of the better versions of the venerable dish I've had of late. The various, plentiful veggies were all chopped up and presented perfectly, while the tasty dressing proved an ideal complement to the whole thing. The generous sprinkling of feta cheese didn't hurt, either.

The Full Monty (\"black bean & corn salsa, lettuce, tomato, grilled chicken, jalapeno, guacamole, chipotle aioli & havarti cheese\"): McSorley's has a bunch of wraps on their extensive menu, but this one stood out to me for obvious reasons (ie anything Mexican is automatically going to catch my eye). And indeed, it's delicious. It might be a little messy but the solid assortment of ingredients and pronounced bold flavors ensure that every bite is delicious. I really enjoyed this.

I guess my one complaint would be that the service was a little slow, but even this I can overlook since the place was packed. We'll absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place doesn't get the recognition it deserves (How am Im the first to review it?!).  The place is a bit of a mess but the wings are fantastic.  BBQ'd, good sauce, and the full wing (!), they are delicious and a pleasant change from the same old deep fried wings.

It only get 4 stars because it was hard to get a seat and the place was FULL of kids (like 5-10 years old kids) on a Friday night.  Not exactly the atmosphere I wanted to watch the game with."}
{"text":"Good nite at Mcsorleys. Easy. Good food & Service. Consistent as always. Local we can trust."}
{"text":"McSorley's still manages to deliver good food, at good prices, in a good atmosphere. A steadfast anchor of the Bayview St. strip, and the same soul as it had when it opened over 20 years ago."}
{"text":"Veggie wrap is delicious! Great waitstaff, very friendly atmosphere. If you're allergic to peanuts, not a great place, since there are peanuts everywhere. But if you're looking to watch a game, catch up with friends, or have a cheap and fun meal, this place is ideal.

My favourite place in Toronto by far! I grew up going here and love the staff and the vibe. Also, the games in the back are a fun bonus."}
{"text":"Sketchy looking bar - which I normally love. But the environment was pretty boring & the cocktails had little alcohol. The prices however were reasonable and the service was friendly. We didn't try the food, but appreciated the free peanuts."}
{"text":"Here's a family friendly cheap and cheerful joint I've been bringing the family to for more than 20 years since my eldest was about 9 years old. It's a sports bar with TVs throughout which still has free peanuts you can nosh on by the bucketful that you help yourself to at the front door. 

In the warm weather they lift up the front window so that you get a breeze from out front, even if you're not sitting on the outdoor patio. The original dish that I ordered again and again was ribs, wings, fries and coleslaw. Coleslaw is nice and fresh and not drowned in mayonnaise.  Their fries frankly are mediocre unless drowned in gravy but their charbroiled ribs and wings more than make up for that with their singed goodness. The burgers and French beef dip sandwiches are decent. Hubby said the burger special stuffed with cheese bacon and guacamole was delicious. Their homemade soups are usually good too. 

There's a whole bunch of pinball machines in the back, enough for a small arcade, which kept our then 9 year old daughter so amused that we had to call her back to eat with Mom & Dad before her dinner got cold! Great for your restless tween gamer boy or girl. They try to keep things interesting with a magician at dinner Wednesday nights.

I confess I prefer coming here at lunch just so I can check out all the eclectic Leaside stores along Bayview, it's a really good street for strolling; with family, friends or your dog. So come here and make an afternoon of it if it's sunny out at any season of the year!"}
