{"text":"Best pizza in north Huntington hands down !!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had Big Nick's for the first time. Our pizza and breadsticks were delivered within the timeframe and were hot and looked great. The driver was nice and professional. The pizza was some of the best one had in a while. I would definitely recommend and will order again soon."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!  RUDE!

The service here is awful. I called tonight and asked \"are there any pizza specials tonight?\"

The reply, \"no.\" That's it. Nothing else. I will never get any food from this place again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for pizza to be delivered to your house, this is the best option in the area.  Breadsticks here are awesome too!"}
{"text":"We love Big NIck's Pizza, the crust is delicious and the toppings are fresh!!!"}
