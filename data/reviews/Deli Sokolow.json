{"text":"Such a hidden gem! Loved the breakfast but also came back for a burger and it was amazing as well. Kind staff - can't wait to try the milkshakes this summer :)"}
{"text":"This is as perfect as neighborhood diner as you can ask for. Great quality for price. While I prefer my latkes fried, they do it right with the Poutine sauce. Benedictes are spot on. As is smoked meat. And it always feels welcoming."}
{"text":"The service was about as good as the food and that is not a compliment.  The poutine was just salt and mushy. I had to wait almost 20 minutes for it. The place had some cleanliness issues as well.  The bathroom looks like it wasn't cleaned in a few days.  They even gave my 10 year old daughter a nasty look when she said that she didn't like the food. In Montreal if you want to make it in the restaurant business you need to step up your game."}
{"text":"No idea why people seem to like this place. I don't believe they offer good value. I don't think the food is very good. Salty does not begin to describe the latke poutine, which others seem to rave about. And the service, although efficient, is anything but friendly or interested. Also, nice touch, offering us coffee as we sat down, not mentioning they were charging for it. Maybe I'm wrong and the others are right. But regardless, I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!   We were the only one in the place and I was dying to eat. Here I was in a deli that served breakfast during the week until 10pm, how incredible is that?! The prices were really affordable (there was a vegetarian burger that was 4$ but it was a huge portion!) and the server was really nice!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat, generous portions, and good value! My potato latkes were black, the potatoes had oxidized, not too good. The borscht was yummy. I hope this business sticks around as a good deli with great value. If they work on the latkes I'll up my rating to five stars!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable. Ambiance décontractée et agréable. Mon expérience a été très bonne."}
{"text":"A good place to go to for smoked meat sandwhiches and soft serve ice cream without a massive line.  I really didn't know what to expect when I bookmarked this place...but I am satisfied that I went.  Came here on a Thursday at 5:30 and we were the only customers...which is fine, since we didn't have to wait...and it started to slowly fill up by 6pm...and noticed there were a lot of pick-ups/take-outs throughout the time I was there.  Seems to be more of local traffic coming in/regulars.  At first, I did NOT have a good start with this place, as soon as we walked in, there was a middle aged woman that was sitting at a large table (which was the first thing we saw since the table faced the entrance), and she startled me. Just looking at us, no smile, no greeting, not knowing if she worked there or what, and luckily a nice staff/waiter (Sinder) greeted us with a warm smile and sat us.  Just this person's presence was very uncomfortable - it felt real negative! Like a ghost! (Could be because she was very still in front of the grandfather clock). Anyway, there were other incidents too, but, we shrugged it off because once the food arrived, our attitudes changed and all was forgotten.  Smoked meat (medium) is juicy and tender, the fries are just like any other casse-croutes type deal (which means good!), ordered the creamy coleslaw and it was good homemade tasting, the vege burger is actually tasty! (I would recommend it), had fun eating the latke poutine - think it was more for the \"oh cool, I'm eating a latke poutine\" factor than really for the quality and taste.  After eating 3 bites of it.. you realize that it's actually really salty!  Maybe I'm biased because of my in-law's latkes, but, the bed of potatoes that the cheese and gravy that it was served on was...dark.  I would still recommend this place - there's quite a few other things you can order I.e. matzo ball soup, cake, chicken salads... I had a mini chocolate & vanilla soft serve ice cream and it was delish!  Faintly sweet and looks like real vanilla bean particles in the vanilla ice cream.    We ended the meal with a cherry cola Cott and Frogger!"}
{"text":"Moi j'ai trouvé un peu cher pour un deli je y retournerais pas meme s'il je viens du coin il a meilleure deli que ca et à meilleure prix  A bit expensive for a deli"}
{"text":"Situé pas très loin de mon travail je suis venu tester avec la gang de la job un midi. Diner sympathique avec une borne d'arcade.  Au niveau des plats c'est simple mais efficace. J'avais pris un milshake fraise qui était plutot pas mal, un burger végétarien et une frite. Le burger était un peu trop sec à mon gout (patate douce, haricot et lentille si je ne me trompe pas). J'ai du ajouter pas mal de mayo pour que cela soit moins sec. Hormis cela c'est harmonieux et je l'ai tout de même apprécié. L'assiette de frite est assez costaud, trop même pour que je la finisse seul. Je vous recommande de la partager ;)  Au niveau prix ce n'est vraiment pas dispendieux. J'en ai eu pour 16$ tx inclus pour tout cela et je n'avais clairement plus faim.  Globalement satisfait mais sans avoir goûté quelque chose d'extraordinaire. Je pourrais revenir sans trop de soucis !"}
{"text":"Adorable waitress will tell you the *whatzwhat* to eat that day...no one rushes you out and great deli-corner breakfast all day..which is a real bargain.   I am all about the keilbasa omlette...yum."}
{"text":"Love this new spot on a corner of Notre Dame in St Henri! Sokolow pays proper respect to the history on this corner and the owners are so happy to talk with you about it. The family of the owners of the casse croute that was in this spot for decades before are still working here. The counter is from Montreal Pool Room, there are tables from Ben's, and the photo blown up on the wall is from Sokolow, the town in Poland where the owner's Grandmother is from.    Anyway, all this aside, there's latke poutine! The gravy is spicy and homemade and good, the cheese curds are squeaky, the latkes are crispy and hearty and taste like memories. I'd love to come back for regular poutine and also for pierogis and more ice cream and also to play all the classic video games!"}
{"text":"This place is all Montreal! I simply love it here! If you want a good inexpensive meal. A personal experience ! Come on down to Deli Sokolow! On Notre Dame and saint marguerite. Five Min from Metro St Henri."}
{"text":"As you can see in my photos, I have returned, this time the latka poutine and verenekas were ready and waiting!  They didn't disappoint, let me tell you!  As a vegetarian (not to be all preachy) it can be difficult to find good poutine options, since most places use a beef or chicken stock for their gravy.  It can be hit or miss, and you never really know what to expect.  Luckily, Deli Sokolow uses a vegetable gravy, so I had nothing to worry about.  Bonus points, it was delicious, which can be difficult to achieve with a vegetable base.  I was a little let down by the verenekas, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try them.  I can't wait to go back to load up on some more latkas!"}
{"text":"After two visits at Deli Sokolow, I struggle to find the right words to describe how I feel about the place. My feelings towards Deli Sokolow are mixed and muddied; the place is certainly not bad, but it's not great either.  Recreating the classic diner experience with a twist, Deli Sokolow's menu includes items such as sandwiches, burgers, veggies burgers and the latka poutine, the latter being their specialty dish. They also serve homemade desserts, ice cream, milkshakes and floaters.   I had the latke poutine and although it was an interesting take on a classic Québécois dish, I can't say I would order it again. The flattened potato mash made me feel like I was scrapping burnt food off a pan.  I also had ice cream and a milkshake. Somehow I expected better and was disappointed to realize their ice cream was no more special than buying a bucket of no name ice cream at the grocery store, scooping a ball and serving it on a 25¢ cone.   There's nothing wrong with Deli Sokolow; it's just average and didn't sweep me off my feet as I hoped it would. If you're hungry and on a budget, looking for a diner experience with some vegetarian options, maybe it's the place for you! As for myself, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here quite often for brunch as it's in our neighbourhood, but it's not just proximity that brings us back!  Service is always super pleasant, the food is delicious (try the perogies), it's also very affordable! So basically it's everything you look for in a brunch."}
{"text":"There is just something about a Jewish-style deli that I really enjoy. Given my lack of Jewish ancestry, it is not simply a function of what I grew up with because I didn't. There is simply something about the homeyness, the familiarity, the old school nature of a deli that I love... well that and the smoked meat of course. Leaving my place on Prince Arthur meant no longer being walking or short bike distance from Schwartz's and the Mile End. Not cool when I need my fix. However, when I heard about a new deli opening in St-Henri, only a short distance away from my new place, I was immediately intrigued and felt the need to give them a try.  Deli Soholow is a deli and ice cream shop offering day around options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Located right on the corner of Notre Dame Ouest and Sainte-Marguerite, the shop definitely is going for a old Deli feel with its use of old school chairs, glass counters, laminate tabletops as well as a metal bar and stools by the window. The decor could use a bit extra pop to it colorwise but otherwise it is a old deli through and through.  For my first visit, I went with a mixture of classic and twisted fare. First was a side of coleslaw - traditional with a vinegar base. And of course, I needed to have a root beer at a deli. Exactly what I wanted. Nothing more and nothing less.  The interesting item though was the latke poutine. Yeah that's right.... a latke poutine. When I heard about this, I knew I needed to try it. I love latkes - once I tried some proper homemade ones years ago, I was hooked - and I most certainly love poutine. I was very curious to see how this would stack up. The portion was generous enough and had a nice thick homestyle gravy and the proper cheese curds. However, the use of large thinner latkes as a base made it that they got stuck together since they were very hot. First time I have ever needed to use a knife when eating a poutine. Right flavours but perhaps not served in the ideal fashion.  For my second visit, I went a bit of more classic. I decided to start with some perogies - potato and cheese stuffed - served with some sour cream. Good flavour as one would expect. Thankfully, they also had a golden crunch all the way around. There is nothing worse than a soft soggy perogy.  The Reuben sandwich was my main attraction this time and hit all the right notes - the melted cheese, the acidic sauerkraut and deliciously rich and fatty smoked meat. Personally I would prefer the smoked meat to be medium cut versus lean but that would be a bit of a nitpick in this instance. A solid solid sandwich and frankly one of the better Reuben's I've had.  And of course, you can't forget about the ice cream. Being able to get classic hard serve cookie dough ice cream in a cone was a nice trip to memory lane for me and a nice way to finish off a meal.  Deli Soholow is a solid deli option and in a area lacking one, a very worthwhile option. The mixture of new and old items is good and you feel the classic Deli vibe. I would recommend however they get other payments options though - cash only so be prepared for that at the moment. My first visit was delayed by that... not cool walking by our lunch option realizing it's a no go. Otherwise, a solid joint and thankfully close enough to satisfy my deli fix.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had the call for greasy, comfort food like French fries. I got the lean smoked meat sandwich with pickles, French fries and coleslaw. The smoked meat was delicious. Honestly besides the fact that the fries could have been a bit more cooked I have nothing bad to say. The service was a bit slow or distracted I'd say. But nothing to not go back."}
