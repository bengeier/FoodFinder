{"text":"Probably a 2.5, but the BF likes this place so I'll round it up to a 3 star.

Came here a few weeks ago around 9:50pm. Didn't know they closed at 10pm. So spend 5 mins looking at menu and got take-out instead. Nice enough of them to still take our orders cause some places have last call 10-15 mins before closing. Got a Cantonese Chow Mein & 2 Baked Rice dishes with 2 milk teas (came with the rice dishes). The Chow Mein was average. I did not like the baked rice dishes. The fried rice underneath looked like they mixed regular rice with bits of scrambled slightly burnt eggs.

Came back just after 2pm on a Monday for late lunch before doing some grocery shopping at T&T. Surprised to learn that their \"afternoon tea\" starts at 2pm. BF got the Beef Noodle Soup ($5.95). I got the Club Sandwich ($6.95). Also got a French Toast with Peanut Butter Filling ($4.95) to share. All came with a drink, so got 3 hk milk teas.

Didn't like the noodles they used in the beef noodle soup. BF also found one piece of pork instead of beef in the soup, so they cook everything in the same broth? The club sandwich was ok. I like my bread more toasted usually though. It was filling. I ate 3 and gave the BF the last one so I would still have room for French toast, which was also ok. Just a slight bit too oily though.  

Service is average. Food came out pretty fast, but is really hit or miss. Lots of their menu items come with a drink though, and prices are decent. Afternoon tea starting at 2pm is good so when I want a late lunch, I can get my \"afternoon tea\" items without having to wait until 2:30/3pm to cheap out on the drink. Always need to have my hk milk tea when I come to a hk style café. Might come back when I do some grocery shopping in the area."}
{"text":"They gave out free chinese newspaper now when we were there for Sunday breakfast.  Food is ok, Price is ok...decent milk tea."}
{"text":"Come here for the rowdy atmosphere. Come here for the \"Hong Kong\" cafe feel. Don't bother coming here for good food because it's mediocre at best. Tasteless, watered down and stringy -- and that's just describing the brisket I had. Good eats to be had elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner at 9pm.  The restaurant closes at 10 (of which i was quickly notified by the staff when I walked in). I said \"okay, no problem. I'm leaving as soon as I finish dinner anyway\".  Sat down at a table because no one seated my friend and I.  We were told to move rather rudely because a woman had come over with a bucket and mop. We did as we were told but seconds later, another couple walk in and sat at the same table we were asked to move from and was not told the same thing.

A woman walked over, put down our menus and asked \"what will you be having?\" I informed her that she had LITERALLY JUST PUT DOWN the menu so we haven't even looked at it yet. She then yells \"YOU KNOW WE CLOSE AT 10!\" I  passively said, \"yes, you told me when I walked in. Is it 10 already?\"  My friend and I quickly decide to have the Beef Noodle Soup and the Wonton and Beef Brisket Soup. 

The food is passable. The only reason I would rank this place 2 stars is because of the Milk Tea, which is good and the price is cheap. Otherwise, the service and atmosphere all around was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Very down to earth diner. Prices are very reasonable don't expect too much."}
{"text":"First time coming here and NEVER coming back. I came with my mom and my sister and we're all VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with our experience at this restaurant. When we first came in, the staff clearly saw us and decided to ignore us. Not only did we have to stand around looking at empty tables for 5 minutes, the menu didn't come until another 10 minutes after. We ordered 3 dishes (sweet and sour pork, vegetable and beef, and half a chicken), which came with soup and rice for almost $2/bowl. Not only did the staff spill soup on my leg, they didn't apologize and just walked away. The spoons they gave us seemed like they were just poorly rinsed and still had some sauce from the previous users. When we told them about the spoons, they looked annoyed and just rinsed it again and returned it to us. (Still sauce on it) When the food came, not only did it take longer than expected they just carelessly placed it on the table. (throwing a frisbee action) We raised our hands to ask for extra napkins, but the staff were no where to be found. But when we asked for the bill, all of a sudden the staff looked like they just won the lottery? Full smiles and great service? SERVICE: 0 STARS FOOD: edible but unhygienic = 1 STAR"}
{"text":"Hong Kong style cafe food, came here for lunch with a friend. Really quick service, food was good. 

Have no complaints except prices could be a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Yes, this isn't Guu, Canoe, or wherever else you go to drop bills and tantalize your palette. But for many, this place is comfort food and a full meal.

I last came to Ho Garden (whose name in Chinese means Peninsula, but as is often the case the two names don't match) 8 years ago before today. That's to say that this place has been around for at least that long, which is no easy feat in the saturated, who-can-lower-their-prices-more Chinese restaurant scene. A friend of mine comes almost every weekend for breakfast on Sundays with his dad. They must be doing something right, despite not being amazing.

Like other Chinese restaurants in general, the variety of options is plentiful. The prices are cheap, and for a measly $7 I had a full plate of Cantonese-style spaghetti bolognese, which came with a cup of Hong Kong milk tea and a bowl of soup. I don't know what the soup's name, but it was stewed with beef and some kind of beef bone and pears, providing a light, faintly sweet taste. The bolognese made me very full, though I wish there were slightly more sauce and that it included cheese. Nothing to write home about, but cheap comfort food is, well, comforting.

The auntie who served us was amiable, which was a plus. Often at HK style cafes, the service is brusque and the servers give off an impatient and frank feeling, which is pretty normal and thus a non-issue for most people who go. Not so here, at least on this visit. I otherwise wouldn't have noticed if service was as expected.

Comfort, familiarity, and cheap food is the premise of Ho Garden, and if that's what you seek, that's what you'll find.

Service: 4/5
Food: 3/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 5/5

{"text":"Looking for variety, sizeable portions, and a casual neighbourhood atmosphere? This is your place. Nothing fancy in food or décor, Ho Garden is all about basic HK style café offerings. From congee to baked rice, to Hainanese chicken and rice to wonton noodles...they have it all! You'll be quickly greeted and directed to an available table, and the waitress will hand you a menu and today's copy of Sing Tao newspaper (free! Yours to keep). Nothing stands out from the menu, the tea is alright, and there is nothing much to write home about (but there's always the opportunity to Yelp about it).

If you don't like slightly run-down café settings and no service, please AVOID coming here - you'll ruin your own mood and have to write a disappointing review. This place is about serving the basics at a convenience, offering a place to read the paper and watch TV (two channels, all the time!), and keeps it affordable for everyone in the neighbourhood. Handymen, contractors, and construction workers are often seen catching their lunch break here, and even those that work nearby will drop in for lunch. 

Really the main things they've got going are portion size, variety, and price tag. If I'm in the area and looking for a quick food fix, I'm here."}
{"text":"HK Style fast food. Been coming here for years.  Food here is hit and miss (sometimes good and sometimes really bad).  For a period the food was really bad.  Too oily, too salty and not cooked properly.  Recently it is getting better. So I'm been coming back more. Whew!  Need my fix for HK fast food.  
Majority of the time, the food is ok. 

They serve breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. 
I would recommend beef brisket with wonton noodle soup, club sandwich, satay beef rice noodle soup and their fried chicken wings and legs. 

Don't expect anything fancy here. After all, it is HK fast food.  Service is not too good here but guess I'm a regular so I don't care no more lol. Price is very reasonable.  

Good quick fix for HK food. Their HK tea is 1 of the best !  But I'm still trying to teach them to keep mayo in the fridge."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick Chinese style food, this is the place!
HK style fast food"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I walk in here. The reason 2 years ago I work near by and I come here often but stopped because of there service. The service is little better but I still don't like it because the way the waitress represent themselves little rude. The food isn't any special. Oh well, I guess if  I'm lucky I'll be back in couple years ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I question why some Chinese restaurants do not use the same naming formats as some Korean restaurants.  Those restaurants can care less if the general English readers understand what businesses they're in.  Examples: Buk Chang Dong, Cho Sun Ok, Songcook, Apkujung, Pojangmacha,etc...

What would the general Yelper think Ho Garden sells? Garden supplies?  ;D
If they use their direct translation, it would be \"Boon Doh\".  sounds cooler?

Most everything is in sets, as in comes with routine soup app and drink.
Relative cheap in prices, nothing costing over $10 if I remembered.
My Hainan Chicken(average) set took awhile to arrive.
Whereas others were according to regular schedule program.
Basically I was there from start-to-end of 9pm Fairchild drama.  2.5'd"}
{"text":"This is a really good place if you just want some quick and good food for a really reasonable price. 

The service is pretty quick and food comes really quick too. It's a really good place to go out for lunch if you are in the area. I have a 1 hour lunch break and that's plenty for me to get there, order and eat, and get back to work before the 1 hour is up. 

Portion size is really good for what you are paying. I'm always full when I leave. The specials are a really good deal too. Soup, entree and a drink. As expected if you want to make it a cold drink you add $1.50 but it's not a huge deal breaker. All places like this follow the same protocol. 

It's very casual dining, but that is expected for a Hong Kong style cafe. There's lots of selection in the menu. 

I will definitely be coming back, as it makes a really good lunch spot during the week without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This place is not bad, I've been coming here since high school. I even used to be a regular so much that they would recognize me and give me a 10% discount every time. 
I'd say the service is pretty quick, they are not the nicest but it's a HK style cafe, ain't nobody got time for that. As long as they get their job done right and aren't purposely rude, I'm good. 
The food usually comes in combos! It's really worth it. The $5.95 combos are the best- you get so much food plus a drink. I'm always filled when I finish my food. This place is ideal if you are in the area and are hungry, while wanting to spend only a bit. The quality of the food is not bad, however, many of their things are not exactly health-conscious. A little too much sodium sometimes.
On weekends... AVOID!!!! The line is crazy long.... who wants to be voluntarily smushed up to a bunch of hungry china men? Not me! And I bet you wouldn't either."}
{"text":"The food is ok here.  But yet i always come here.   One thing you cant beat is the price here, has one of the lowest cha cha tang food prices i have seen.

Gets busy during busy hours and parking is hard to find, just park a bit farther.

Afternoon snack menu is also good and cheap!"}
{"text":"Thought it had improved based on some of these reviews.  I should have listened the first time.

Still very salty, still very oily and still very bad service.

Yeah I get it, it's not healthy food.  But there should be some standard of limit of how much msg and oil is in a dish.  C'mon.

Also, why don't you train staff to be somewhat courteous, no scowling and how about washing your hands"}

Comments
- food is decent, there is alot of other places within a block or two that are better.
- service is mediocre - not much service, but the food comes out quick. 
- parking could be a pain during weekend, since they share the same parking lot with a grocery store. 
- only upside to this place is the price - it's cheap, and they give out free Chinese newspaper in the morning on weekends."}
{"text":"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Someone should report this one to Dine Safe. Photos of this dirty place should be posted online. Waitress also yelled across the entire length of the restaurant over the noise of a full house to get the cashier to prepare our bill. Isn't that something? This place is a disaster. I don't understand why it is still in business. It's because cheap people support it. I went there once and realized what a mistake it was. Never again!"}
{"text":"Ho Garden Chinese Restaurant is a Hong Kong Style Cafe with pretty good lunch specials that you can order for $4-7. They have decent food portions for the price and it comes with a coffee or tea. On my last visit, I ordered the Beef Tendon and Brisket in Noodle Soup. It could have used more meat, but other than that, it really hit the spot. I ordered a Honk Kong Style Tea with it, that I thoroughly enjoyed after my meal. 

Its a Hong Kong Style Cafe so I am not expecting the best service in the world or for the waitresses to even have any conversation with me. Though to my surprise after finishing my well enjoyed meal the waitress did put the icing on the cake / buttered me up by calling me Lang Jai (Handsome) on my cash out. I might just come back here for more compliments and try some of the other menu items. JimStar Out!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for casual dinner. Sitting in front of a table with a staff wrapping wonton in front of me. After watching her doing it, I would not come here to eat wonton. The lady was sneezing while wrapping, then rubbing her nose and talk non stop. Imagine how clean the wonton could be! HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Ho Garden for a cheap brunch.  The place was crowded.  This must be due to the lack of Hong Kong style cafe in the proximity.  I seated myself cause no wait staff noticed me standing in front of the door.  I was given a menu, yet I could not get anyone's attention to place an order.  Finally, I stood up to go to bathroom, and a waitress noticed me en-route.  When I returned, she sat me at a better location and took my order (sausage and egg with spaghetti in soup, $3.50) promptly.  The food was quite tasty and well portioned.  The inexpensive meal came with a hot beverage.

In all, the food was on par with other HK style cafes.  The price was quite low.  The services could be better, but I am willing to give them a second chance if I am in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30 PM for their \"afternoon tea\" menu. On the plus side, the prices for dishes are very inexpensive. However, service and food quality is merely average. We ordered the fried satay noodles ($5.95), the egg salad sandwiches with accompanying satay beef and vermicelli soup ($4.95), and 2 iced-lemon teas. The noodles were too dry for my taste, and the soup broth was a bit too salty. Overall, the meal was fairly average but you really cant beat the price and decent portion size.  Between two people, we spent $18 for two dishes and two drinks."}
{"text":"Its a very decent hk style cafe. Got a baked spaghetti with meat sauce. The sauce is a bit on the sweeter side. The place was super busy but we dod  ot have to wait long for a seat. The food was good but nothing special worth mentioning."}

Never coming back"}
{"text":"Pros:
Lots of variety in menu
Prices are very good

Cons:
Food is average at best

Ho Garden is your typical HK style cafe.  I believe their main selling points are ample seating, great variety in menu and good prices.  The food could be better but at the price point, there's little to complain about. 

We came here Thanksgiving day for lunch because we needed to do some shopping at the TNT near by.  Walking in, the place was super busy.  They have plenty of seating here though.  For a HK style cafe, this place is one of the bigger ones I've seen. 

Opening up their menu, you can see they have tons of variety.  rice dishes, noodles in soup or fired, baked rices and more.  You name it. they probably have a special for it.  The prices here are also very good.  Meals average between $8-$10 with some premium items going for more.  All specials come with soup and a drink.  We ordered a baked pork chop on macaroni and a beef with egg sauce on rice.

The food here is you get what you pay for.  The portions are pretty good. The food itself is average at best.  It's not terrible but it won't wow either. The baked pasta was a little on the burned side for me.  The beef rice could of used a bit more beef.  Little nitpicks here and there I know, but it could of been that much better.  

Because it's always so busy here, service can take a while at times.  I had to ask for the bill a couple of times, but when you get service, it's pretty good.  

Overall, Ho Garden is as standard as they come.  I would defeinitly come again in the future, though it might not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Beware of dry mouth! I'd really only eat here again if nothing else nearby was open. 

The menu is inexpensive, food comes in large portions but the quality if just not there. They cook with an obscene amount of MSG and grease. They have poor breakfast choices as well and this place just cannot fry an egg properly. 

This place is not the cleanest, even by quick and dirty Chinese restaurant standards.The milk tea is very weak but leaves an awful film in your mouth. Cold drinks here are super watery."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Ho Garden at Alton Towers over 10 years ago, ever since I was in elementary school. My mother knows the owners and she comes here so often that we get 10% off every time so I guess that's nice. The service there is actually not bad, they seem to be really nice, unlike all the other HK cafes. The food is average but inexpensive, and the portions are good. I usually come here in the morning for breakfast before school, and sometimes I order take out for lunch. Their service is also pretty quick, especially in the morning cause I'm usually in a rush. Unlike many other HK cafes, they actually take debit."}
{"text":"First time I visited was two years ago, I ordered an hoi Nam chicken with rice n the rice was turned bad.
A year ago I vivisted again n ordered beef fried hofun, the chief forgot to put salt so it had No taste.
Today I had a beef noodles in soup and the beef was still cold.

Good job, they will never fail to fail you."}
{"text":"I come here often as it's close to where I live. I've tried a variety of dishes usually involving what's on the breakfast or lunch special menus. I usually get something soup based or sandwich. It's your pretty standard HK style restaurant. Of course it's super cheap and if you want to come in for something quick and simple this is the place to go!

I recommend just grabbing things on the special menus because it's really cheap and comes with a drink!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Ho garden for about 10 years and I found that ever since renovations their food has improved. I usually get the baked rice/spaghetti items. One of the main things other than the food that I look for in a hk cafe is their hot cup of milk tea. I find that the milk tea here is above average compared to other HK cafes. Honestly I never have high expectations for great customer service through the hk Cafe industry but the employees are all super nice and attentive which I am happy of every time I go for a meal. Food comes fast but the food isn't the best but each item varies on quality. They only accept cash and interac!"}
{"text":"don't go. food wasn't good. they take away your tea and rush u out the door. horrible."}

{"text":"Visited for dinner today.

Service is average, price is average, food quality is OK.

Vegerables (mainly carrots) were all mushed in the borsche soup that came with my meal.

Servers don't pay great attention to the customers much at all.

Their signature hainan chicken rice was my order today.  Chicken had bones (the original ones should be boneless).  Rice did not have the chicken oil taste at all, was rather dry.  Ginger/onion sauce was not the best either.

My brother ordered tomato beef rice, which had enough sauce and was well cooked.

If youre just looking for a quick dinner, visiting here would be OK."}
{"text":"Breakfast specials here are not that bad. You get a drink with your meal. Either coffee, hot lemon tea or hot milk tea. They will charge your extra $1 or so to make the tea and milk tea cold."}
{"text":"Not complaining about the food, but rather their attitude and service. The kind of place that make you feel like being robbed after the visit!! Their dictionary simply doesn't have \"respect\" and \"customer service\". And very very short sighted that they'd rather make sure you pay enough tip for one time instead of getting your business by continuing to go back.

Quite rude and dare you requesting one more thing and you'll be damned!

Even with such a terrible service, be expected to give decent tips, or you'd never get out of the place! They would nail you down and make you pay.

I wish they understand what the real meaning behind tipping!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I did not read any reviews before coming here.. it is NYE and our plan was to go for some steak at Day & Night but after reading the reviews on it and seeing how over priced it was we decided not to go and we ended up going to Ho Garden. This place used to be located at McCowan & Steeles (before Steeles) and we couldn't believe it closed down! When we found out it was relocated to Woodbine & 16th we decided to give it a try and OMG. Best choice ever - can't believe we didn't know about it earlier. The steak was AMAZING. When it comes to steak I'm VERY picky (if it don't taste good I ain't eating another bite)..But I actually almost finished my steak and rice .. The steak dinner came with soup, drink, and dessert..We were so stuffed ! It was about $8.99 for my steak dinner and my boyfriend ordered a $15 T bone steak.This place has nice decor, very cheap food, delicious food, and good service. Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch in Sunday, was seated immediately but took 15 minutes for any type of service, let alone menus to order from.  Upon ordering the food again took forever and was average at best but overly salty.  The drinks were also forgotten and had to be reminded multiple times before the warmish teas arrived which tasted worse than instant.  

There is no WiFi network and cell reception is very weak inside.

The bill was never presented but was asked for money on several occasions.

There are many other cafes in the area with much better service and food quality.

Good luck in staying alive in the hyper competitive Toronto market"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the satay vermicelli. The restaurant has nice decor and looks clean. Food came really fast. The portion here is fairly large for an inexpensive price. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ho Garden is another HK Style Chinese Restaurant that trying to offer everything. 

They recently renovated so the interior is nice and modern.. a lot cleaner and chic than other HK Style Restaurant with the darker hue of decoration.

The prices here are relatively cheap.. as a won ton noodle soup is $3.95 and breakfast combo is starting at $2.50.

I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup set ($5.95) with drink.. ok a mistakes to order here... the beef is quite chunky and tender but the noodle is those supermarket bought one.

The services here is not too good. I was a little pissed when my waitress took my order but she did not send it to the kitchen right away instead talking to the lady right behind me for a good 5 minutes about her DIY decorated nails...... hmmmmmm 

They accepts Cash and Interac."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to give this place a 3.5/5 for their food. Their food is not bad at all. Very tasty, inexpensive, and they give you a lot for the price you pay. However, their customer service and attitude is horrible. When I was going to pay, I was going give them the exact change because I wanted to get rid of some coins but they said don't give them changes, and then proceeded to take my $100 bill and said that you still have to give tips. When I walked back to the table, they hurried me again and asked for tips again. Their attitude is so rude. They asked me for tips twice and it's not like I'm not giving them any. I was going to leave them a big tip because the food was good but because they kept pushing me, I didn't even want to leave them a big tip. Of course I'm going leave a tip if you served me well but if you keep rushing me when I'm taking my time, I will not be happy. Overall, don't expect this place to have good service. They are also not attentive when it comes to refilling drinks. It's very unfortunate for the owner because it's the waitresses customer service that makes customers not come again. I won't want to come again for their unpleasant service."}

{"text":"Came here twice and both times food and service was horrible.
 
Ordered the Grilled Pork Chop and Chicken with white rice. 

The grilled Pork Chop was completely dry and tasteless no meat. half the portion was bone. The rice was soggy.

Chicken was dry, cold and prolly less than 4oz of meat.  There was suppose to be a side dish of cabbage.  Literally there was 7 pieces as you can see in the picture.  Compared to a Vietnamese  restaurant when you get Grilled Pork Chop and rice it's thick and juicy with eggs and lots of sauce along with tons of cabbage. This was tasteless and disgusting.

Second dish was the yellow chicken with rice. The yellow chicken was more tasty for sure. But still so little side and nothing else was given with the dish and it was cold.

It also comes with complimentary soup broth and drinks. I seen they use a microwave to heat up one of my coffee. 

Its a 2 stars for me. Food and service was horrible."}
