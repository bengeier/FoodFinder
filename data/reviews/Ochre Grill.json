{"text":"Great quite place, children friendly. Great tasty food and super yummy dessert.  Will come here again for sure!
I had Greek salad and chicken in wild mushroom sauce. So delicious! For dessert was a nicely decorated brownie with ice cream. I liked it very much!
My husband had baked salmon. The plate was a bit small, but he said he had enough (he doesn't eat too much usually). 
My baby loved the decoration there and food too. 
I'm so glad we went there, it made my evening. My stomach feels so happy after such a good treat. 
Waiters were very friendly."}
{"text":"If my husband were reviewing Ochre, it would garner five stars.  However, he eats meat.  The service was attentive without being overbearing, and I loved the fact that water was brought to the table in a large bottle so we could refill our glasses as needed.  The atmosphere was casual and clean, like Moxies before it got dark, trendy and club-like.  My husband had the Moroccan short ribs, and loved them.  I am very surprised he didn't lick his plate.  I wound up with the ubiquitous veggie burger without mayo.  I'm not entirely sure the \"patty\" would have passed for vegan, but I made the no mayo effort.  I could have had the garden side salad with vinaigrette to round out the veggie options.  Little to no effort to please those who don't eat meat or dairy, but the couple we dined with thoroughly enjoyed their meaty entrees.  Greek dry-rubbed ribs and apple-ey barbeque ribs pleased their palates."}
{"text":"We went to Ochre Grill on Friday night, and it was fantastic.  Nestled in a little strip mall in Evergreen, we would have likely never experienced this neighbourhood gem if it weren't for one of those group-buy websites, which offered a nice discount.  We decided to take a chance, and boy were we happy we did.

The restaurant is beautiful to look at.  It is decorated in warm hues and gives off a very elegant vibe, yet I still felt at home in shorts and a t-shirt.  The menu was simple, but had something for everyone.  We ordered two of the Italian Deli pizzas, a Margarita pizza, and the stuffed chicken, with lettuce wraps to start.  The food was delicious, reasonably priced ($15 for a huge pizza that I am amazed is targeted as an individual entree), and plated nicely. The service was also quite good - my favourite part was having our own water carafe at the table.  Not only does this make the server's job easier, but it makes me feel better about simply ordering water.

We will definitely be back - the spaghetti and meatball pizza is intriguing, and I have to try their ribs.  I can't wait!"}
