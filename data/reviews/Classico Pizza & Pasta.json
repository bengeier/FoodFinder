{"text":"There's a lot of competition for your pizza dollars around Bloor and Jane, and Classico's the place to get some more creatively-topped, gourmet pizza. It's quite good, but as a result the pizza is priced higher than the nearby chains like Pizza Pizza, and their main business seems to be dine-in.

You can get a pizza at Classico to take out, but the last time I did so, I felt like I was a lower priority than the sit-down customers, and there wasn't really any place to wait for it."}
{"text":"The Penne ala Vodka i had was very very good!
I just tried their pizza tonight, it's not that good, Pizzaiolo next door is way better and also  cheaper in price.
Definitely go for their pastas!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place about a year ago, and my bf and I have gone back at least 4 times, its a cozy, quiet restaurant and the food is pretty good. Love their thin crust pizzas as well. I find all the veggies taste fresh. Creme brûlée is always my go to dessert."}
{"text":"It's 2013 and Classico changed again .... They are now trying to be an \"upscale\" Italian restaurant by changing the décor and by raising their prices. Up until now Classico used to be the best family pizza restaurant in the west end where families could come in and SHARE an extra large pizza for $25-30. Now Classico stopped offering family size pizzas. Everyone has to order their own pizza (with $16 being the cheapest option !!). This means our typical Classico family meal (incl. drinks, tips etc) went from $55 to almost $100. At that price I would rather go to Terroni. I hope that Classico is going to realize that they going to loose \"the families\" which used to be the bulk of their clients. I don't think they will be able to attract the \"romantic couple dinner crowd\" (at least not as long as they that cheesy horse picture hanging their wall) ..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the owner is friendly. And I love the pasta Alfredo I watched as they made a new batch of sauce and saw them rasp some fresh nutmeg in instead of pre ground garbage. The prices are a bit much even with the 2$ discount they offer on take out. But I enjoy not having to cook once in a while"}
{"text":"They've recently effed up my order, twice, and although the pizza is very very good, the service is scattered and place needs to be better managed."}
{"text":"A warm and cozy environment for a hot lunch on a cold day. My boyfriend and I ordered two pizzas and they were both delicious. Generous sizes!

Service was decent enough, no complaints! 

Nice little location ."}
{"text":"Friday night 8:30pm... Service friendly but incredibly slow.  Ordered #4 pizza and salad.  Took over 40 min to come out and the place wasn't even half full.  Pizza was merely okay.  The location at Yonge and Eg seems better IMHO.  This place was better than King Slice down the street which seems to have declined since I last went.."}
{"text":"Great reasonable price. Better now that movie theater across street is open"}
{"text":"How have I never written a review for Classico?? I've been coming here forever. Don't go often but when I do it's always a treat. Changed hands not too long ago and took a dip in quality for a bit but seems to be back to where it once was.

The Curry Chicken pasta is to die for, as is the Penne Aribbiata. So good. Not too expensive, good friendly staff, fast service, good menu, it's a B-dub staple that I hope never goes away."}
{"text":"Make delicious food! Also online with dinendash.ca; so you are able to make a reservation online and get your food right away!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Classico after living in the hood for over two years! Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, green peppers, and mushrooms (1/4 cheese only for the kid!) and 1/2 litre of house red.  Although the pizza didn't blow my mind, it was very tasty and fresh. My son really enjoyed it too. Service was very friendly, but a bit slow. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, some of the friendliest restaurant staff I've ever met. The food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. A really nice atmosphere with a good amount of room to eat outside on a nice summer night. I had the Penne Arabiata both times, delicious and a great portion!

This won't apply to most, but this was also my choice for the best place to have a large group meal for about 20 people on Bloor west for a wedding rehearsal dinner. We visited about 10 other restaurants on the street and they all insisted we had to choose from a special \"group menu\" where a three course meal was forced and everything cost twice as much. Classico just let us use the normal menu with some extra salad shared amongst everyone and we just had the space booked off for us."}
{"text":"Place is very consistent. Very good value for money. Pizzas are pretty decent, but I recommend the steak or the lasagna. Service is good as well. Try the patio ;)"}
{"text":"The food is good, but nothing extrodinary. I am quite happy with what I get for the money there, it's okay. (I like their pastas and salads more then their pizzas).

What I love about this place is the atmospthere. Summer evenings are so nice there."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. One large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. $19 

The pizza was hot, fresh and pretty good but nothing extraordinary. One friend used the word bland."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Got the Jesca Pizza and Lasagna. Pizza was fresh and tasty but was a little hard, especially after it got cold. The lasagna seemed like it was microwaved as it seemed a little watery(from the spinach innards I suppose)."}
