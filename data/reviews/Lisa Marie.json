{"text":"Food - 4/5
Service - 0/5

My friends and I arrived for our brunch reservation at 12pm. We ordered our food by 12:20pm. Our food arrived by 12:40pm.

At 1:08pm the server advised us the next reservation has arrived and told us we had to pay our bill. Half our food was still on our table, waiting to be eaten!

I told the server we aren't leaving and that they were unreasonable. The server came back again within 5mins and again, asked if we can finish up and pay our bill so they  can seat the next reservation. After some investigation, the server acknowledged that they double booked the table mistakenly. Again, I told them we aren't leaving for at least another 30mins and it's not for me to solve their mistake. The server came back 2 more times within 10 mins to ask us to leave.

By 1:30pm we paid our bill and my friends and I were chatting amongst ourselves. The server, again, came and reminded us the other party was waiting. 

Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Came here because their menu looked interesting - but a huge disappointment. Food was lukewarm, long wait. I got the California eggs Benedict. What was supposed to be pico de gallo was a cherry tomato, pad Thai fries had a sauce that tastes more like spicy ketchup, eggs and hollandaise were barely passable. Open faced salmon sandwich had salmon that was over-smoked and fishy. 

Basically you should only go here if you're into mediocre overpriced food and like eating with loud pretentious yuppies"}
{"text":"Came here at 11am on a Saturday for my birthday. Ordered the Getaway Car Caesar with a beer chaser. My meal was the Peameal Eh sandwich with Pad Thai Fries. Although the drinks and the meal were both quite good, the price is pretty steep. $16 for breakfast (and was the most inexpensive option) and $14 for the Caesar. I enjoyed it but probably won't return. I've had better brunches for a lot less."}
{"text":"Overall I found the food unspectacular and a bit expensive for what it is, but is probably close to a three. We tried the turkey wings (liked it, flavorful), eggplant in a jar (not great, served with some soggy flakes of zucchini. some crunch would have been nice), alabama tailgaters (can't go too wrong wrapping things in bacon, but this is barely a morsel of a plate) and the tuna roll (I thought the tuna got overwhelmed by everything else). 

I had to knock my rating down to a two though, because the restaurant is a sauna in the summer! They have a garage door that opens to the street, but there is really no airflow, and you just sit there sweating. Especially when it's humid out. Some fans or AC please!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night and tried their Summerlicious menu. I would give it 3 or 4 stars for the food (steak was the best meal of the night) but the service was terrible. We started off the evening by ordering a bottle of wine (half price Wednesday's, woo hoo!). About 15 minutes after we ordered the same waitress came back and asked us what we would like to drink. That was the first red flag but laughed it off. After the first odd incident we placed our order at the same time as the couple sitting next to us (there were only 2 of us as well). They finished their 3 courses before we got our 1st course. They even noticed and were shocked at how long we were waiting for our first dish (over 1 hour). After the hour, our waitress finally came up to us and said the order didn't go through so she retook our order. We thought the worst was over. We waited a bit more because the kitchen was now busy (we initially arrived when the restaurant opened) and finally received our appetizers. The main course took a bit long as well but the desserts came out shortly after finishing our mains. Unfortunately the waitress brought us the wrong desserts so she had to put the order in once again. More waiting. We spent two hours there while other guests that got there an hour after us left before us. We're not ones to complain but there was no real apology for the mishaps or an offer to take $ off our bill. Very disappointed. I understand if the waitress was new or having a bad day but a little consideration would of been appreciated. We also missed the movie we were planning on going to afterwards."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and food presentation, average quality though... Menu is very creative."}
{"text":"I went to Lisa Marie's yesterday for brunch.  The service and atmosphere were fine, but the food is just gross. They go out of their way to make everything as unhealthy as possible. It's also fairly expensive for what you get. Two meals, with two cups of coffee cost almost $60 after tax and tip. I would never go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my experience at Lisa Marie. 

Came for brunch, was pretty busy so had to wait around 20 minutes for a table.

Waiting for our order to be taken took around 25 minutes. Not an issue but puzzling as one staff was simply setting other tables and not really attending to customers. 

Had to ask for water, and the cutlery both on separate occasions. Waiters were nice, but l the lack of service didn't leave a great taste in my mouth. 

Menu is delicious but super fattening, FYI. Would have been nice to have some healthier options. But hey, I'm not going to complain about the menu cause I did pick the restaurant and knew what they serve. Also, Pad Thai fries are pretty damn amazing. 

The food finally came and..... it was lukewarm. Extremely disappointing. 

Would rate this restaurant a 2.5. The food was tasty but lack of service and lukewarm meal didn't cut it for me. 

My advice, skip it. Lots of other great brunch or dinner places in the area."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5.
I went for dinner on a beautiful Friday evening in summer with the doors fully open. 

Had several dishes: the two notables: the sugo sharing plate (8 hour brisket in home style tomato sauce with good bread to grab it all) was the best one followed by the Alabama tailgators (carpaccio wrapped in crispy bacon).   

Service was average, the seating on tall stools not very comfortable,  and it was noisier than you'd expect.   Not Grand Electric noisy but still. 

I liked the food though but nothing spectacular.  
Total price for 2 people for food and 2 beers = 95.

 Normally a 4 means I'd come back - - but here I wouldn't come back or refer anyone else. But I don't regret going there either."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Great vibe. Fantastic brunch. One thing that I did not like is that some staff is not \"immigrant friendly\". Without going into details I'll just say that we all live in Toronto where 50% of population was not born in Canada. We (immigrants) work, live and pay taxes here, yes, our English is not great, but it should not be an excuse to not be nice... Shame..."}
{"text":"Chef of the moment Matt Basile's new brick and mortar joint opened yesterday to some enthusiastic patrons. As the namesake would suggest a giant Elvis greets you at the door. The decor was quite inviting, with warm wood tables and steel stools and rustic lighting. The frontage of the restaurant has a garage door so in the summer time this place will have a nice openness to it. There is a lovely mini market place in the back with canned goods and marinated/seasoned proteins though I didn't really explore it as much as I would like on this first trip.

Drinks:
The cocktail menu had some delicious selections, ranging from around $10-14  per choice. There is also a choice selection of beer and wine as an alternative. I chose the Ceasar w/ side car beer to start, handy for a make-your-own Michelada. It was absolutely delicious. After a follow up standard pint of Steamwhistle I tried out another cocktail which I believe was a Testa Dura. Decent, but I would probably not order it again.

Food:
The food menu, or cicchetti menu, is a lovely contrast of snackable dishes. We decided to sample as much as we could (two rounds of food). Here's the results:
- Deep Fried Pizza (first option, with smoked duck): a lovely blend of rich flavors, the hoisin really rounds out this bite size pizza.
- Deep Fried Cheeseburger: this was a cute little burger, the quail egg really boosts the presentation value of the dish but overall it just pales in comparison to the other dishes we tried.
- Pork Belly Cheese Thang:  the pork belly was cooked to absolute perfection and the contrast of flavors from the handmade salsa to the aioli with a bit of kick, this was my personal favorite!
- Turkey Wings (hoisin or buffalo style): these gigantic sized wings were a favorite for both of us. The meat was tender and the sauces were perfect.
- Short Rib Polenta Patty: another winner here, the short rib was rich and flavorful.
- Tuna Puttanesca Roll: this one had a some heat to it, but not one of our favorites of the night.

For desert we tried out the bite size donuts which I believe were made with marrow. Perfect way to end an amazing meal. It's a bit cliche but they really did melt-in-your-mouth and weren't overly sweet. They were served up with what I believe was a nice tart raspberry sauce. 

Matt was kind enough to stop and introduce himself and checked in later. Our server Emily was excellent too. I can't wait to come back and sample some more of Matt's amazing creations, seems like he has another winner on his hands with Lisa Marie."}
{"text":"A cute and warm environment for Sunday brunch! I went with my mother and sister on Sunday early afternoon and although we did not have a reservation, we were seated quickly. Both the service and the food were excellent! We all split the S'mores Pancakes and the Bacon Explosion Benedict with a side of Pad Thai Fries. The S'mores pancakes came as a stack of pancakes filled with Nutella and topped with marshmallows. It was sweet, but not too sweet. Everything tasted great but the Bacon Benedict and Pad Thai Fries were the real winners. I would highly recommend Lisa Marie!"}
{"text":"Went there last week for dinner, and it was a great experience! A lot of their dishes in the menu are asian inspired, so it's ideal for sharing. The server was very nice and patiently explained every question we had. The lighting and ambience was very hip, but we didn't expect it to be THAT loud, as we couldn't hear each other across the table!

So overall it's a great hang out spot and have good food, but I wouldn't go if you are going for a romantic date/ looking for a place for actual conversation."}
{"text":"well the first review is obviously either a friend of the owner or an employee because  when we stopped in last night the place was totally dead and understandably so. Being an Elvis themed restaurant we were expecting southern cooking but instead found a small menu of random dishes that really made no sense together. The combination of the eerie emptiness and dark lighting made us decide to just grab a drink and a snack move on someplace better. My friend ordered the philly cheesesteak tostada which could have been really good except for the \"American\" AKA processed AKA plastic cheese. I mean the prices are nuts for what they are offering you'd think they could at least use real ingredients. I got a mozzarella bone marrow \"sandweech\" which was more fried bread than anything. Two thick slices of fried bread with a  tiny slice of mozzarella and apparently there was some bone marrow in there too but you couldn't really taste anything besides the bread. The service was good though. I'm actually surprised they can keep good servers in such a crummy slow restaurant. Don't waste your time/money."}
{"text":"In search of a random place to eat in, walked into Lisa Marie, first I thought the bits and bites won't be enough to fill my tummy, but once the food arrived, I was amazed by presentation. Then after bite after a bite it was delicious. Worth going back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch here with friends and the coffee and tea were served luke-warm. When our food arrived only one of the plates was actually hot. I ordered the shakshuka which had 0 seasoning and tasted as though they dumped a can of diced tomatoes in a pan. Would not recommend spending over $20 on a brunch here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Lisa Marie as the owner is the same as Fidel Gastros. I had also watched his journey from pop up to restauranteur in the show Rebel Without a Kitchen. So, I was excited to try the restaurant. In short, it did not live up to expectations in any form. The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. It seems to be not sure what it is. There's a mural about Elvis, some tin siding, an awkward back room and coat rack, and not much else. 

The service itself was pretty pathetic. The restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday night but it still took over 15 minutes to place an order for a drink and then similarity as long to order food. The appetizer came out quick and the pad Thai fries which it's known for were delicious. But, I found the portion, while great for an appetizer size, was overpriced at $10. 

As for the mains, my girlfriend ordered a shrimp sandwich, which consisted of cheap baby shrimp and mayonnaise with a side of burnt kettle chips. Again, overpriced for such a cheap and poor quality dish. I ordered the steak frites, which sounded delicious. Steak, roasted potatoes, charred peppers and onion with a vinaigrette and a chimichurri sauce at $26. Unfortunately, it came out a full 20 plus minutes after hers did! Overall, it too was underwhelming and tasted like home cooked steak and potatoes with sautéed peppers. The chimichurri sauce was non existent, and while it was good, was certainly not worth the price. We decided to forgo dessert based on the disappointments from the meal and knowing each overpriced item was adding up. 

Unfortunately I can say that neither of us will not be going back, which is unfortunate. The owner, Matt seems like a great guy and has a great story, but I'd sooner stick to the food truck, which had better food and prices."}
{"text":"Cute Elvis-themed decor and menu with good service, but the food leads me to a verdict of Totes Meh. Our dishes (Carolina fried chicken, Kung Pao cauliflower, and General Tsao's Shrimp roll) were really lacking in flavor with the exception of the fried chicken, which just tasted like mustard. The chicken was also extremely dry. I think this sampling was likely representative of the entire menu - a little conceptually ambitious and creative with poor execution. Combined with a bottle of wine on half-off bottles Wednesday, the bill was about $100 with tax and tip. Sooo not worth it.

Ultimately, this seems to be a gimmicky joint with some charm but no substance."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's Bday...Service are great, very friendly staff but food was ok. Only thing I've like is the pulled pork macaroni.. it's a MUST and great to share for 6-8ppl! Sago (their special), just taste like tomato sauce.. The place is ok but nothing special about it."}
{"text":"I went for brunch on a weekend and loved that they take reservations. Service was a little slow (30 mins to get our food) but the food was worth the wait thankfully. 

There were many high tables and a few bench tables that were convenient for family with kids. The bar and paintings of the wall made for a hip atmosphere.

My husband ordered the fried cornish hen on top of jalapeno corn bread waffles ($17). A reasonable portion and the chicken had crispy skin and tender meat. The hot sauce on the side was ultra spicy, the way I like it!

I had the double pancake pork burgers topped with lettuce, cheese and tomato, with pad Thai fries ($15). I normally eat my burgers with my hands, and with the pancake as the \"bread\", it did not hold up well and was better eaten with a fork and knife. The pork had a nice spice to it and juicy! This is the first time I have heard of pad Thai fries...koodos for being creative, and also being absolutely AMAZING!! They were the highlight of my meal.

I ordered a lemonade thinking it was fresh lemonade (even, my receipt printed \"fresh lemonade\") but it was the San Pellegrino Lemonade ($4). It was fine, but fresh lemonade would have been much better!

Overall: 
Great food. Must order the pad thai fries and I wish they would make their own lemonade and orange juice. There are only 8 to 10 menu brunch menu items so go try them all!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for brunch but good for the most part. Chicken and cornbread waffle was a little over cooked, but it did take quite a while to get our food so I didn't complain.  Caesars were quite tasty. Service though slow was good and friendly. My biggest complaint?  Turn down the music!!! Im all for energy and atmosphere and I love music but it was ridiculously loud...we had to scream at each other across the table and the fifth person at the table was pretty much left out of any conversation unless it was with me sitting next to her. Unfortunately the excessive noise was all coming from what seemed like 1 speaker so sitting anywhere near the back it was pretty insane!!  Please fix this and I wil for sure come back :)"}
{"text":"A real local ma and pa shop. Love the unique menu items.
Had eggs benedict, could use more hollandais but the bacon and brioch are excellent. 
Service by Nicole was excellent, thanks"}
{"text":"Pretty perfect experience. We went for Triple B (burgers, beers and bingo) and had a truly wonderful time! 

I had the Motherclucker - a double fried chicken burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and a special sauce. Amazing. The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and moist inside. The batter was well-seasoned and did not overwhelm the flavour of the dark meat chicken. Delicious. The burger was mammoth and even though I had brought my appetite, I was unable to finish it. 

My husband had the Kim-Cheese burger - a beef burger topped with pork belly, kimchi, Sriracha aioli and cheese. This burger was meaty, juicy, spicy and cheesy. It hit all the notes you want a burger to hit. 

Both burgers were paired with pad thai fries. These things are so great! Crispy fries with fluffy potato insides topped with pad thai fixins and spicy sauce. You will be stuffed to the rafters from your burger, but will continue to try and eat more! 

Pairing these great meals with $5 beers and outrageously fun bingo made for a great date night. We'll be back, and next time hope to be victorious!!"}
{"text":"I didn't go into Lisa Marie with incredibly high expectations. I was hoping for well executed elvis inspired little bites, and perhaps something interesting to share with my dining companion. Previous reviews suggest friendly service, and were not wrong - the services is thoughtful and attentive, which makes the issues with the ambiance (inadequate lighting, music decibel levels that make conversation impossible) even more obvious.

I didn't expect to be blown away by the food - and I wasn't.

The Tuna Puttanesca has never been introduced to a puttanesca sauce (the accompanying chili dipping sauce lacks flavour, and the mango sauce tastes like it's been poured out of a box of nectar), while the fish is mushy and surprisingly fishy.

The sugo & bag of bead to share is deeply satisfying and wouldn't be out of place at my favourite nonna's table. The sauce, brisket, brisket and pork belly have married into each other and the warm bread is perfect to mop up every last drop with. If all the food was of this caliber, I would return, often.

The sangria is decently made and flavourful, but bereft of fruit - unless you count the token slice of orange decorating my glass.

On the whole, if you're looking for a space to observe the hipster culture that defines Queen West and play gastronomic roulette with the menu (\"When it's good, it's very very good, but when it's bad, it's horrid\") Lisa Marie is a prime spot.

Why Lisa Marie didn't get 5 stars:
- The music is incredibly loud. Unless you're a lip reader, don't expect to have any conversation you can understand. (Maybe this is okay since hipsters prefer to text each other instead of talking?)
- The space gets pretty dark after sunset. Excellent if you don't want to really see what you're eating, or whom you're dining with - neither of which I wanted.
- Incredibly inconsistent food - I'd almost be happier if it was consistently awful, or consistently amazing. 
- For the price (~$40/pp) there are lots of other places I can go (including Lamesa across the street) for food that satisfies in a space where my other senses aren't being taxed and assaulted."}
{"text":"Apart from my own delicious home cooking (which admittedly is an all day affair) I had without a doubt the best pulled pork sandwich to date.

I tried to pimp my girlfriend to the chef for another but alas they only accept credit cards.

Get the Thai Fries, the other variation fries look great but these babies will change your life.

EAT HERE NOW."}
{"text":"Tried the  Double Pancake Pork Burgers ($14.00) &  Fried Cornish Hen & Corn Bread Waffles ($17.00) on a Sunday.

I heard Lisa Marie served delicious brunch menu items and I am so glad I went. You definitely don't get the typical eggs, toast & bacon here but expect to see a much more refined yet totally brunch-appropriate dishes! With all entrees, you get an option for buttermilk fries or pad Thai fries. If you don't mind a bit of spice, go for the pad Thai fries - they are amazing! What a cool new take on traditional fries & potato wedges served at brunch.

I can't wait to go back to try the rest of their brunch offerings."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch or even better, Tuesday's Burger's, Bingo and Beer night. Seriously good burgers and the thai fries are a guilty pleasure. Friendly staff definitely helps."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance here but the food left a lot to be desired. The portions are small for the price and the menu seemed to be trying hard to be cool and trendy, but was missing the mark. A lot of the food was fried and there weren't a lot of options.

The service was great tho and I love the communal style of eating. Also, a number of good beers on tap."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends for my birthday dinner on Tuesday, which is their bingo night. 

We ordered every item on the menu except the motherclucker since they were sold out. My fave was the Portobello mushroom burger. I was disappointed with the kimchi burger, it lacked any flavour and was not as spicy as I would expect. However the main reason I wanted to come here was for the pad thai fries and was not disappointed!  I loved it! Some of my gfs found it spicy, but it was perfect for me. 

Bingo was fun! One of my girls won 2x. They were pretty generous with the prizes as well. The dj was awesome, she was very entertaining. 

Overall I would come back just for the bingo, fries and hope they don't sell out of the motherclucker. I would also like to try their brunch, since they are pretty well known for that."}
{"text":"I was really torn on this one between 4 and 5. Eventually gave a 5 because the food is really excellent, together with service and atmosphere. The location and prices are some drawbacks - but ultimately I think the food wins (technically that's what you are there for).

Went for dinner and had their \"tapas\" style platters. Usually require a few for a group of 4, usually a plate holding enough tasters for each but not enough to fill you up. I would say for a group of 4 approximately 8 platters should do it. Their pad-thai fries are a total must. 

I don't think there was anything there that I did not enjoy. Their moroccan ribs are insane! Def my fav thing on the menu. And try their extra-spicy sauce (if you dare). Again, did I mention the pad thai fries? They also have a nice menu of Ontario craft beers which compliment the food well.

The owner is the same as the Fidel Gastro food trucks - and he unleashes his creativity with the menu. Don't spend any more time on Yelp and go try it! Be open minded and you won't be disappointed.

The atmosphere is amazing - usually young people, but not the annoying hippie crowd I was expecting for a place on Queen W. Young professionals having a great time. 

Some things that may take away from the experience:

1. Location - There is a hobo meeting spot not far from the restaurant, even had a crazy lady walk in and just walk around. But never felt weird and ultimately it is a very small element to it...
2. Prices - In my opinion the biggest weakness - I feel the prices are a bit ridiculous. A normal meal that fills you up can easily push to $50/person. Is it worth it in the end? I say yes - the creativity and the quality of the ingredients used makes it worth the experience. Unfortunately, the high prices usually mean that I will not return as often as I would like - but then again, the place is packed all the time..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, never disappointed, in fact every time I go somehow it is better than the last. The ceviche nachos, flautas, curry Mac n cheese, the buns...... Incredible!! The brunch is also amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to Lisa Marie for brunch today! We brought our 15 month old baby! They have high chairs. We got our little guy the chicken and waffles. He loved the waffles! And the chicken! And he never eats chicken! The chicken was really flavourful! Overall, The food was yummy! I loved the pad Thai fries! The staff really loves babies! And they are all super friendly! Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Brunch spots that take reservations always deserve a bonus star. 

Lisa Marie isn't quite like any other brunch spot in the Queen West neighborhood. There are plenty of competition in the hip area, but Lisa Marie's menu definitely stands out. 

I had to try the Double Pancake Pork Burger, with a side of duck fat fries (which are actually made with home fries). It feels weird drenching the burger in syrup, but OMG it tastes phenomenal. If you love pancakes AND burgers, you must order this.

I also shared Cornish Hen & Waffles with a side of Pad Thai Fries (first time hearing of this). The dish was difficult to eat because of the bone in the hen. The waffle was hard to cut into, but together, with maple syrup, it was delicious! 

My friends loved their dishes too - the peameal bacon sandwich was made like pulled pork! The Eggs Benedict Explosion looked delicious too. 

The place is loud, so may not be too good for large groups as we couldn't hear each other well across the table. I also liked how our bill came in a cassette tape holder. 

Lisa Marie is where you will find creativity in not only their menu, but also their decor!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday before the Summerlicious rush.  The prix fixe menu looked tempting, but we were headed to a game and didn't have the time.  Instead, my boyfriend and I had 2 drinks and sandwiches.  The beers are reasonable, and they have a selection of local brews.  The cocktail list is nice, although some of them can be a little pricey (my boyfriend recommends the tequila and Aperol, I forget what it is called).  The food was good, although it's a little expensive for what you get.  Still, I wanted to try the place and I wasn't disappointed.  The fish sandwich with pineapple was excellent, and the fried steak sandwich was also good.  Next time, though, I want to try a bunch of the appetizers/snacks and share.  Food is quite good, but possibly not a place to go if you're ravenously hungry."}
{"text":"\"A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby\"

To be honest, my experience was a bit less than satisfactory.
And I can't help myself, I called the restaurant when I got home.
I got the answering machine, twice.

A minute later, Matt Basile called me back from his cell phone.
I described my experience and areas that I thought could use improvement.
He received my opinions well and said that he would make it up to me if I return.
As an owner, I think Matt is fantastic. He's high energy and talented.  
He really takes pride in his food and cares about customer experience.
He's great and one of the reasons I would give Lisa Marie a second chance.

Here's how the night went.
I was hosting an event for a group.
I made the reservation for 10.
I called during the week to reconfirm the reservation, they thought the reservation was for 6.
Upon arrival, my reservation had been made into 12 split into two tables.
At least they take reservations, right?

As for food, tapas style.
2-3 items per person usually does the trick.

Those who ordered tuna rolls really liked them.
Also, the turkey wings were super impressively large!

I ordered the bone marrow, cheese sangweeeeh ($7)
Deep fried and crispy on the outside.
The bread really absorbs all the moisture, so the sandwich was a bit dryer than expected.

The pork belly ($5) was okay, but I did feel like it needed to be saltier...
and fattier, which is strange since it's like 60 percent fat.
Throw a bit more grease on, and it'll be perfect!

As for dessert, the Elvis in the jar is like a meal itself.
Banana cream, peanut butter, french toast, candied bacon, and maple syrup.
It looks cool!

It wasn't that sweet surprisingly.
The french toast was also a bit hard from being in the fridge at slightly too cold of a temperature.  I made this comment to Matt, he said that it's made fresh every day and he'd look into it.

As for cocktails - they have a fun list!
The Caesars look freaking awesome.
I ordered a bourbon based cocktail - The Bronx.  I could have sworn I read it had  egg whites in it, maybe non, but the drink was a bit one dimensional.

Also, our service was a bit lacking.
I was told that the server has some personal health issues that required attention.  That's fine, but she probably should have been removed from her shift earlier.  We didn't have a smile all evening.  Hurried conversations about the menu.  I had to walk to the bar and flag her down because she only took one persons order at the table for dessert.  

Also, the group gratuity at 18% was automatically applied to the bill.
Some people at the table didn't notice.  Including myself.
So I tipped on a tip for mediocre service.

Overall, I didn't have a perfect experience here.
But, I think Matt is great and I hope that Lisa Marie works out their kinks.  He did offer to make it up to us if we returned.  That was the right thing to say and I really appreciate the gesture.  Only being a few weeks old, growing pains are expected, so, I will consider returning."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing mind blowing. We didn't have any complaints but we didn't leave there thinking we had a delicious meal. Everything was just mediocre. I would recommend for people to try it for themselves but we just felt it was nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"We had kim-cheese burger and americano burger. The food was delicious and good size. However, the kim-cheese was a bit over salted for us. We enjoyed the food but the atmosphere was not really comfortable because the music was too loud. The washroom was dirty. We will order to take out next time."}
{"text":"Food is great, as is the deli counter at the back. The music, however, is WAY too loud and people are constantly shouting over each other just to be heard. A solid three stars and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too packed. It was a summer day so their entire front wall opened up onto Queen Street (like a garage door) which was really nice. They had half price bottles of wine as their Wednesday special. I didn't take advantage of this but it looked like most tables got the deal. 

Two of us ordered: pad thai fries, spaghetti and meatball Wednesday special, Jamaican patty potpie, and tuna ceviche nachos. Everything tasted pretty average. I don't think anything stood out too much. 

I saw a lot of previous Yelp reviews rave about the pad thai fries which is why I tried it. Honestly, I thought it was way too spicy for my liking (if you can't eat spice, I wouldn't recommend this) and also it was kind of soggy by the time it came because the fries were drenched in the sauce."}
{"text":"Been to Lisa Marie's a few times now. The food is great (the Moroccan Short Rib is excellent) and the drinks are reasonably priced for Toronto although in general the place is fairly pricey. The one disappointment is the service as they will quickly usher you out if you are there for too long, which is funny as they are quite slow."}
{"text":"Tried their nutella burger with plaintain chips for burger week, and may update this review when I try their regular dinner menu.

At lunchtime, came by and was expecting a full menu, but looks like they were just promoting the nutella burger along with the Paypal app, with some marketing reps outside showing everyone how to get a free burger by paying for the app.

Fidel Gastro's of the food truck fame owns this restaurant so was expecting more BBQ inspired food, but the Nutella burger didn't seem to hit those expectations.  The nutella didn't add anything to the experience, and I felt that if you were going to put plaintain on a burger, it should be freshly grilled plaintain to have that smokiness, instead of the out of the bag chips they used.  

I shouldn't complain too much seeing as the burger was free, but I did see app-less customers paying with cash, so for those paying cash, you have much more selection.

For those looking for a free burger this weekend, try Toma, much better experience."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day and they had a special menu. We were NOT disappointed. We had the Thai Curry Mac 'n Cheese, the Pad Thai Fries, the flautas, the ribs and the chicken. Everything was delicious and flavourful. I would have tried the dessert but we were just too full. The ambiance was great and staff was courteous and friendly. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sub par and way too costly for the goods. Kimchi fries, a special, were cold upon serving. Patatas bravas were soapy. The fried chicken is 4 pieces for 20 bucks, and no wag worth the cost. Avoid."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch because Chococrepe was closed. It was a pretty empty restaurant and looked more like a pub than a brunch place but after reading the menu we decided to stay. I got the frittata which was the special and my friend got \"Pemeal, eh?\" without the bun because he doesn't eat gluten. My favorite part of the meal were definitely the pad Thai fries. They weren't spicy enough for me so I asked for hot sauce expecting siracha sauce but the brought over this chunky house hot sauce that was even better. It was spicy when eating it but didn't burn after. I would definitely ask for this again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for their summerlicious menu. The appetizers were meh. I had the ribs as the main and it was good, aside from the shortbread that was not good at all. My friends got the chicken and waffles which didn't taste very good at all."}
{"text":"I ate here on Sunday and it was the worst brunch I've had Amin a long time. I got the bacon explosion eggs Benny and side Thai fries. The fries came out cold, the bacon ham thinggy came out with raw centres, and to top it all off.... I asked for a orange juice mimosa and got grapefruit. I hate grape fruit. I heard bad things about this place for a while but I always had good experiences in the last so I thought I'd give it another shot. Wish I didn't. Never again. :("}
{"text":"I've been twice for brunch and this is a perfect spot to indulge in typical Toronto cuisine with a creative twist, and especially good to take your out-of-town guests to. After watching the classic episode of You Gotta Eat Here...
 http://www.foodnetwork.ca/shows/you-gotta-eat-here/video/episode/lisa-marie-the-burner-restaurant-and-lounge-katies-restaurant-bar/video.html?v=436425283967 
I had wanted to go for another visit and try another one of the cool takes on trad brunch favourites. (see pics) As seen in the vid, the concept is to not take anything too seriously, yet stick consistently to what works on Queen West.
The sign of a successful restaurant is consistently good food, a predictable menu, and this is where Lisa Marie hits gold with their recipe for a fun place to visit, and good food to share with friends.
Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Overall very underwhelmed. This was on my top 3 places to eat brunch at while in town. We waited for a seat, not too long but outside for about 10/15 mins, which was fine bc we were excited. We were seated in between two other couples at a long high table. I ordered the bacon explosion Benedict. But the staff didn't send our order through. After an hour and a half of waiting and watching the two other couples FINISH their food (one couple sat down AFTER US), our waitress apologized for not sending our order and we had to wait another 30mins for our food. The bacon explosion benny was okay but def not an  explosion of flavour. I also think I got regular hollondaise instead of the spicy. The duck fat home fries were also nothing special. When I told the waitress I wasn't very happy she had nothing really to say. Barely apologized. Still had to pay full price after spending almost 4hrs there for a mediocre meal. I get that it may have been busy but at least show you care about the guest's experience?"}
{"text":"I have been following the owner of this restaurant from his Fidel Gastro food truck days!! Food was never a disappointment then. So when I heard he was opening up a restaurant on Queen West i was thrilled.

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time about 6 months ago and instantly fell in love with the decor and sort of communal seating. The manager greeted us right away and was so friendly, we told him all about ourselves and he recommended some drinks and food items. 

Their menu is always changing but a classic and must have at Lisa Marie is the PAD THAI fries. So delicious and like nothing you've ever tasted before. We've tried about 3 different menus and most of the things on there. I trust his food decisions, so I try as much as I can. My favourite so far, beef cheek ravioli... mmmm and for dessert, the decadent Elvis in a jar. 

This place is not where you go on a diet!! So much fun on the weekends, good food, great drinks and after 10:30, they have a live dj so amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Thursday nights they have special ribs! The ribs are delicious. Nice and tender. They also have life music Thursday nights.    

The whiskey sour is people made (with the eggs whites, a little over priced tho, but super delicious)."}
{"text":"I was really excited to drag my boyfriend down here after I found out that Lisa Marie got a brunch menu that included an interpretation of chicken and waffles (Cornish hen with cornbread waffles).  In general the dish was quite good. The Cornish hen was excellently flavoured and moist, and the duck fat fries (my choice of side) was also great and didn't get boring after a few bites. However what dragged down the rating from what would have been a 4 star was the cornbread waffles. They were incredibly dry, and though I can see additional ingredients in the batter, I couldn't taste it. Although they did give me house made hot sauce and syrup presumably to moisten the waffle, the combo just didn't work very well together, and in the end I could not finish the waffle.

Lisa Marie also lost points form the pancake burger that my boyfriend ordered. I saw a picture of this, and encouraged him to get it thinking it would be much bigger than it actually was. Since my bf only ordered a salad as the accompanying side, the petite pancake burger just wasn't enough to fill him up from the meal. Which is unfortunate because I vaguely remember the burger being $12-$14, so for that price one would hope to be full after the meal. In addition I wouldn't say the flavour in the pancake burger was all that outstanding either.

Overall, I'm sure that downtown Toronto has more brunch options than Lisa Marie, but I may consider returning for a lunch or dinner experience though."}
{"text":"Booked a last minute table on vday yesterday at Lisa Marie and it was such a memorable experience.
Live jazz , great ambiance
They offered vday menu only yesterday
Ordered two salads were okay. 
Pad Thai fries n ribs are tasty though!
Ribs were very tender and fries flavorful
Desserts need some improvement
Service was friendly and attentive
Overall would go back"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, the service was excellent, the food was interesting and it would have been great if served warm.  I had the California Eggs Benny, look good but tasted luke warm. They could do better if they wanted to. I suspect they have their crowd and don't care."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0 

I have mixed feelings about this place. Ordered the Nap Time Special and the California Benny - both items were just okay. 

The steak that came with the nap time special was quite fibrous. I'm surprised that they did not offer a steak knife for folks to cut into it. The thick cut bacon was crispy and quite tasty though. The duck fat 'fries' were underwhelming - the texture was almost like a baked potato that were cut up into huge chunks and served at room temperature. The duck fat was nearly non existent from a flavour profile perspective. 

The benny was not bad in terms of flavour and went well with the brioche but also served at a borderline cold temperature."}
{"text":"Ahh, forgot to post this from Sept. :(

My fixation with brunch and Instagram lead me to Lisa Marie. Each week, for months, Lisa Marie posted a photo of the sexiest pancakes I've never seen, S'Mores Pancakes. I simply cannot resist toasted marshmallows; I was doomed/destined to try them, so I wrangled together 5 more foodies and off we went. Brunch AF. 

I made reservations weeks in advance. This restaurant seems to be busy all the time and this particular day was no exception. When I arrived, there was a line already and it wasn't even noon! Our table was just about ready when my friends began to arrive. We were seated and the mimosas were ordered immediately. Obviously. 

Our server was fabulous. She must hear about patrons' inability to choose every day. I knew what I wanted before I made the reservation: those damn sexy pancakes. My friends all made their selections just as the mimosas arrived. For the price, mimosas looked small, but was served in a wine glass. Not a crime, but I think if the same mimosa was served in a champagne flute, it would not only be more appropriate, but definitely more Instagram-worthy. Cue the Instagram Boomerang videos! 

The food arrives. I'm giddy. Those pancakes were just as sexy as I hoped they'd be. All marshmallowy, Nutella-y and carby. Absolute bliss! Luckily, my friend beside me ordered the Pemeal Eh sandwich with a side of Pad Thai Fries, so I was able to steal some...several...what's the difference? Anyway, my group was enjoying their brunchy goodness almost as much as they enjoying steaking a taste from each other's plates. 

Everything went flawlessly, except one unfortunate thing: it was particularly hot and the A/C was broken. The servers were still in great spirits anyway! The food was still great and the cold water jugs kept full by our fabulous servers kept everyone happy. Yes, it was hot that day, but that doesn't mean it's not a fab spot to eat!"}
{"text":"I came here for Toronto beer week, the pad thai fries were excellent and I also had the cemita sandwich which was very good too, although it is fairly small. 

I had come here a few years before for toronto burger week for a burger that had fried plantains and coconut cream on it and that was also a very good burger. 

Nice atmosphere and they play good music. I'd definitely come here again for a proper dinner or a brunch."}
{"text":"I was totally underwhelmed by this place. 

I had high brunch hopes and nothing was terrible but everything was meh. The pad thai fries while tasty were lukewarm. My fork was dirty, the waitress was so overrun she basically ran away before we finished ordering and almost threw our plates at us. 

It was overpriced for what it was and there was no imagination in any of the food - it was very basic.

So meh overall."}
{"text":"My sister and I recently took some american cousins to Lisa Marie while they were in town for a family affair. Seeing as we were taking out family my sister and I saw it to be completely appropriate, as two employed adults, to take our mother's credit card and order the entire menu. (Here's a helpful tip! Whenever you're going out anywhere get someone else to pay and you'll find everything far more enjoyable!) 

Newly cashed up my sister decided to invite her friend Christina who, she informed us, would show up \"quite drunk\" but would surely enjoy our mother's \"generosity\".

\"Oh no!\" I exclaimed, \"Our perfect evening will be ruined!\" Well, i was wrong, Christina showed up absolutely plastered but was a delight through the entire meal. So that's the last you'll be hearing of her in this review.

We arrived at around 7:50 on friday and found it was easy to get a table for five but beware, the entire restaurant was full roughly 10 minutes after we sat down. We all sampled from their nice variety of Ontario Craft Beers until our lovely waitress came back and we proclaimed, \"The entire menu please!\". 

We started off with the Sugo, a large portion of a hearty meat sauce served with a side of bread in a brown paper bag (Kitsch!). Let me tell you, if you want to feel like you have the biggest balls in the goddamn world order this dish while wearing a brand new unworn white shirt. I swear I didn't get a drop on me. I haven't felt like a such a man in years and women have found me irresistible ever since.

From this point on the night was a blur as it seems that Christina's (oopps, guess I did mention her again. LOL!) drunkness may have rubbed off on all of us a little but highlights included the pork belly cheese thing, the duck confit pizza and the turkey wing.

Would have given them 4 stars but I had to ding them one for the parking.
On a completely unrelated note, do not drive down to queen west, get drunk and try to leave your car parked on the street overnight while you subway home. Your car will get towed."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for Summerlicious (dinner) and it was great. To start, the Alabama Tailgaters were a hit for all of us. Being super savoury, the 2-piece appetizer was the right amount. It came with some green beans that were a bit on the greasy side, but a nice addition to the plate. 

For the main course, I got the Nashville Hot Chicken. It had the perfect amount of kick and the spiciness complemented the buttered bread and pickles well. 

For dessert, the Elvis French Toast was amazing! I'm not a HUGE fan of peanut butter, but the peanut butter flavoured whipped cream was tasty. However, the small slice of candied bacon stole the show - super crunchy and great flavour. If I ever come back in the future, I'd definitely order a full-sized version of this dessert. 

Overall, Lisa Marie's a great place for a fun night out. The atmosphere is super loud, the comfort food is flavourful, and the service was solid. The place is on the small side so do get reservations if you can."}
{"text":"I went here for bunch. My wife and her friends weren't overly impressed with their orders of Eggs Benedict, but I ordered the Nap Time (steak, bacon and eggs) along with a beer/lemonade drink and it was the best breakfast I've had in years."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat at Lisa Marie for  forever and finally  did for Winterlicious last night.It was amazing service ,great music. The food however  was just ok maybe I had super high expections but hey it happens sometimes."}
{"text":"I liked it!  They have double mad tom ipa on tap so that's always a winner.  The communal table thing works pretty well but I got stuck beside some awful people who irritated me immensely.  Service was great and my burger and fries were really tasty.  The pad thai fries are addictive."}
{"text":"Beast had a lineup out the door so we decided to try Lisa Marie. Far from being a lame second  choice, it proved to be fun and delicious.

We sat at the bar, because we didn't have a reservation (nice to know they take them), but I prefer the bar despite the stools. It wan't a real issue since most of the seating here consists of bar stools, anyway.

We both began with a Caesar. It was perfect and prepared with a deep fried piece of sausage, olives and a pickle slice. My boyfriend had a bacon benedict concoction that he enjoyed very much. I had the deep fried cornish hen with pad thai fries. How great are those fries?? I think they coat them in cornstarch, fry them and then then toss them in ketchup and peanut sauce. with bean sprouts and cilantro?? At any rate, a solid side dish. The cornish hen was juicy as could be and the batter was crisp and well seasoned. The cornmeal muffin was only ok, but what I liked the best about this dish was that they served the syrup on the side but they also gave a ramekin of nice habernero sauce. I don't like my food to be very sweet, so the ability to control this was appreciated by me.

Our bartender was great and even made me an Aperol Fizz upon request.

Great 70's playlist going at a perfect sound level.

I think that a lot of their food is a bit gimmicky and quite unhealthy, but in the end, healthy is very overrated at brunch. It's overrated period. Live like The King: Eat, Drink, Get Fat and Die.

Lisa Marie would be proud."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for brunch. I had the cornish hen on a jalapeño waffle with pad thai fries. The food was good, but nothing special and a little pricey. The waffle was tasty, but the hen was lacking. I had also expressed a desire to have half salad/half fries, but my server was unable to make it happen, which was disappointing. I wasn't exactly asking for the moon or extra food; I simply wanted half a portion of each. There are many places to eat in Toronto, so I always find it odd when restaurant aren't willing to do anything out of the ordinary for a paying customer, and it wasn't exactly busy either. I probably won't go back as there are better options in terms of food and service just a few metres away..."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 8/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10

-- Fried Cornish Hen and Corn Bread Waffles ($17)
Old school fried cornish hen on a jalapeno corn bread waffle with maple syrup, hot sauce, and duck fat home fries. 

I like corn bread (I don't know where the jalapenos factored in because I didn't taste any and I'm sensitive to heat) and I like waffles, but I didn't like the combination. It was not as delicious as corn bread and not as crunchy or sweet as waffles. The chicken was good. Not much to say about it other than that it wasn't dry, which is always a plus for chicken. The duck fat home fries were probably the star for me. These were my first \"anything fried in duck fat\" so I don't know if them being extra crispy is what sets it apart, but that's what it was: super crispy, which is my favourite.

The portion was decent, but I'm not entirely convinced it was worth $17. 

I tried my company's orders as well: the Bacon Explosion Benedict ($17) looked amazing and was a solid egg's benedict. The portion for pad thai fries is huge, but I'd be careful if you don't have a tolerance for spicy because it had a bit of a kick and cumulatively, it'd get quite spicy. The Open-Faced Smoked Fish Club ($16) looked decent, but was a little underwhelming to me. I never really understood open-faced sandwiches anyway and smoked fish is just smoked fish.

Service was quick and each table gets their own jug of water, so no complaints there. It's a decent space. The back area of the restaurant where it's more dimly lit looked much cooler than the front, but the front is not bad too. It's spaced out enough that each table has their own space and privacy. 

I'm not entirely sold on the food's value, but it's not a bad brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with my girlfriends and had the MOST amazing time! Their prix fix menu is only 35 bucks and you get a starter, main and a dessert! The live music was beautiful although a little loud at times and difficult to converse over, and the service was A1!! All of our dishes were presented BEAUTIFULLY and tasted even better. The wine was great, loved the overall atmosphere would def come back!"}
{"text":"Only a 10-15 minute wait for a table for 4 - not bad for a Saturday. Keep in mind though that smaller parties are seated on benches with other small parties. The seating is not great - the stools were pretty uncomfortable to sit for a full meal (including the long wait for the food). There were no hooks for coats/purses - would have been a great addition.

Both of the items we wanted to order (Elvis French Toast and Cornish Hen) were sold out, so one member of our party did not end up eating. Two members had the bacon explosion and the other had the naptime special. The food that did come was okay, but not fabulous considering the price. For 3 entrees and 4 drinks (2 with alcohol, 2 without) the bill came to over $90 - not cheap for breakfast! Would have appreciated a standard breakfast item (eggs, bacon and potatoes).

The food was over a 20 minute wait, so that definitely soured our experience. When the food came, one of the items was not even warm. Service overall was pretty slow, and our server never stopped by to check on us.

Overall, it's a great idea, great Elvis theme, but their brunch needs some work."}
{"text":"stopped by for brunch on a Sunday.

got there around 1130, there were about 3-4 couples sitting at various communal table. they just told us to pick wherever we wanted to sit so we found a spot close to the window.

the menu was meat heavy, and it doesn't have a simple eggs & bacon for the boring folks.  the food was AMAZING. the service was great.

the server, George, was very helpful in helping us decide what to get, tho it's pretty simple when chicken and waffle is there, YOU ALWAYS ORDER IT!

it's actually cornish hen and corn bread waffle. the hen was perfectly fried. crispy skin, moist and flavourful meats. the corn bread waffle was good, but i would prefer to be regular waffle. the pad thai fries aka fries tossed in a siracha, butter and lime juice sauce was AWESOME. the cold bean sprouts on top adds a nice amount of coolness and crunch to it.

my friend got the \"the peameal, eh\" without the bun. she loved it.

as mentioned, service was great. they were on top on keeping our coffees and water topped. they kept checking on us to make sure everything was good, and we didn't need anything else. didn't give us too much trouble when we hung around too long chatting. (the restaurant was busy, but not to the point of line up out the door busy..)

a great addition to the city's brunch scene and a very welcomed addition to the neighbourhood. keep up the great work, now i'm planning a visit for night time!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Wednesday night for their famous spaghetti & meatballs night; I had been here before for it and am a repeat customer. Apparently they have a rotating menu every few seasons? I've attached a photo of the current menu as of July 2017. In addition to the spaghetti & meatballs, we ordered the Jamaican Pot Pie, Pad Thai Fries, and Tuna Ceviche. The fries were doused in hot sauce and lacked flavor aside from spice, it's a decent item but I don't think I would order it again. The same could be said with the Jamaican Pot Pie, it's a decent item but not something I would order again on another visit. I would order the Tuna Ceviche again however, as it had the perfect amount of softness with the right amount of chips and onions.
 
Fortunately the weather on that night was nice so they had the garage doors open for a nice view and decent breeze; the ambiance is pretty good for a low-key weekday night and they play some cool hip-hop there. Overall I would recommend this place for a small gathering or date night."}
{"text":"Went here last night taking our 11 and 7 year old boys. Whilst this area obviously isn't really associated with family dining the staff were great and the food was awesome. The chef was happy to take some of the spice out of the kids food which meant the grown ups could enjoy feasting on the Carolina and Seoul fried chicken dishes as well as the build your own pork belly dishes . Yum and thanks for a great dinner experience. Wish you all the best ..."}
{"text":"I came for their famous brunch. In spite of the fairly average rating I'm giving the place, I think it's likely I would award at least 4 stars if I had ordered pretty much anything else I saw around me rather than what I went for: the bacon explosion eggs benny.

It's a nice place, with several relatively large tables to manage decent size groups (approx 8). However, either they have no AC or it's insufficient as it was very warm inside on a hot day. Our server was wonderful.

Back to the bacon explosion. It's $18 and comes with a choice of a side. A bit pricier, but fair value for the quality of the ingredients and unique sides. The bacon explosion is essentially ground sausage, which is then wrapped and rolled in bacon, and then cooked. It's then served on a brioche bun, with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. I know that some people have the motto \"too much is never enough\" when it comes to meat, but really, it dominated the dish too much. The sausage had to be about 2\" thick, and you could hardly manage to have it along with brioche and some egg on the fork for one bite. I also found the meat a bit overcooked to my liking - though the middle wasn't. Perhaps another downside of having such a thick cut (or roll) of meat.

Still, the quality of the meat was very good, they did the poached eggs perfectly, and a very good hollandaise. It wasn't a fail by any means.

In spite a little buyer's remorse I had with my dish, I know from seeing the other dishes around me that there are other things to look forward to, and well worth making another visit."}
{"text":"Awesome place! 
Love the mc that night. She was hilarious and entertaining. 

Went on burger and bingo night. 
Food was awesome and two girls from our table won at bingo so that's always nice. 

We came there for a birthday outing and they had no desserts available. Also there was a limited menu (6 dishes) and they ran out of a dish."}
{"text":"A little surprised that they don't have a dedicated website, not too easy to find the menu and info.  Food was actually very good!  I went with 10 people so one person ordered for everybody so I wasn't sure what I was eating at all times.  My favourites were these skewers of something wrapped in bacon and the polenta.  We had the Elvis dessert which was delicious and not too sweet which was perfect.  It had caramelized bacon, bananas and some other stuff that I can't remember.  They opened the very large window by the street to let the cool air in, but it was still a bit hot.  After our meal as we walked out I noticed many people smoking right out front.  I'm happy our table wasn't beside the street or the smell of smoke would have definitely spoiled the experience."}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place, so we came back for brunch today. I wasn't crazy about it the first time we ate here a few years ago, and now I'm even less crazy about it. 

The Good

- Service is good.

- They have lineups but the wait is pretty short. They have good turnover. 

- Good ambiance and they play a good mix of old/new rock and pop. It's a fun place.

- The surrounding neighbourhood is fun with lots to do. So if you come here for brunch you can take a walk over to the many trendy shops nearby.

- Good selection of brunch eats. They have vegetarian options. Not sure about gluten free.

- The chicken and waffles were pretty good. 

The Bad

- The food isn't great. It's decent (though I'm really picky so take this with a grain of salt if you're less so), but it also came cold. The fries were cold. Someone sitting near us asked for their pancakes to be warmed up, and the server couldn't do it because all of the ovens were full. Well, do something. Maybe throw them on a pan? I know people are busy, but your food shouldn't be coming to you cold. 

- Our server forgot to fill up our glasses and coffees. It's not \"bottomless\" coffee if I can see the bottom, Jessica. 

Verdict: I'm not against coming back here, but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"Communal seating. Loud band. Loud. Good food. Expensive. Hip."}
{"text":"**GREAT BRUNCH on QUEEN WEST**

Finally had the opportunity to come here for brunch. Shamefully ,I've always shied away from coming here because I just assumed it was a hipster bar. To my surprise and terribly quick judgement I was extremely impressed with my experience!

We were seated quickly and our server was the MOST friendly. The brunch menu had an eclectic selection for almost everyone. I ordered the Double Pancake Pork Burger which was basically an extreme and better version of a Big Mac. Instead of buns they cleverly slid burger and toppings in between 2 pancakes and gave you some maple syrup on the side. It also came with a side of Pad Thai fries. I was skeptical about trying it, but maybe it was the company I was with, or the vibe of the place, or quite possibly the awesome 90s hip hop that was playing in the background but I said \"F*%k it. YOLO.\" Probably the best decision I made today. Sad but true. Fries doused in flavourful sauce made for pad thai noodles. Those fries were AMAZING!! 

I give Lisa Marie's 4 Stars for now because I WILL be coming back for sure but for their dinner menu, which I'm looking forward to!

Sorry I was quick to judge! I loved it, guys!!"}
{"text":"So close to a 4 star review, but while some of their dishes hit a high, I wasn't impressed with enough to completely fall in love with Lisa Marie. 

I came in here with a group of 7 for a birthday dinner, which is perfect for sampling a vast majority of the items in their pretty small menu. It's not a haven for someone like me that has lost their love for red meat, but even I couldn't argue that some of their meaty dishes were delicious. But a big meaty fan would certainly love it here. 

A consistent theme I see with the reviews here are that these guys pack a lot of flavour in to their small dishes and I would most certainly agree with that. But for me I recall more of the lows than the highs of the food here which is why I gave these guys a hesitant 3 and not 4 stars. 

The service here was amazing, our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and gave us fine recommendations, and the food didn't take long to start streaming out of the kitchen. 

Didn't love the ribs (but that's just me, since I didn't hear any complaints from anyone else in my group) or the pad thai fries and it was unfortunate they didn't have my first 2 choices of beer listed on the menu.

The plus side for me is that their menu seems to change frequently, and I would definitely come back here for brunch since it seems they do that well, but while I wouldn't suggest coming back here for dinner I would not be opposed if it was suggested to me."}
{"text":"I guess your experience with Lisa Marie depends highly on when you come during the day.  In my case I came a little later in the evening between around 9pm on a Friday.  

Given this place has so many mouthwatering photos of brunch and stuff well let's just say you can't have that in the evening which is sort of sad.  Being that this place is the brick and mortar of Fidel Gastro's food truck there are some dishes that may be familiar to those that know the truck perhaps.  

Granted I shared my plate of Seoul Fried Chicken described as:

\"Half crispy fried chicken tossed in Korean pepper sauce served with the house made kimchi and sweet potato noodle stir fry\"

This was from the online menu perhaps it's not verbatim these days but the fried chicken we received had no such stir fry not to mention what we were served wasn't really \"half\" a chicken as it is defined these days by almost any place you go to which includes yes, Swiss Chalet one of the lowest common denominators when trying to measure chicken dinners.

What I mean by this is the chicken basket I received was indeed by definition \"half\" a chicken but not half dark and white meat but rather the lower half which are universally known as the \"cheap cuts\".  What I received was a basket of 2 drumsticks and 2 thigh pieces not 1 drum, 1 thigh, 1 unsplit wing and 1 half breast.  

As far as the chicken goes it was just OK.  This was the 2nd time in the day I'd had so falled Korean fried chicken and and this point in my short yet condensed experience with KFC I've had more than my fair share.  I've been to more establishments serving some sort of version of KFC since June '15 than there are months between June and the present (December) in the GTA alone nevermind the 4 others I've been to in the US.  I can say I know a thing or two about KFC and how many places serve it.

Now I get it that Lisa Marie is not a Korean restaurant I totally get that.  The thing is neither is the Country General or Duke's Refresher bar for that matter.  Lisa Marie's fried chicken is decent but besides kimchi and a sauce what makes this particular fried chicken so \"Korean\"?

The flavor is good but I would have preferred getting a true \"half\" chicken as it's pretty much universally known and not necessarily 4 dark meat pieces which are not as large and filling as white meat pieces.

For a side I had ordered the Pad Thai fries.  Now this was a treat.  The fries not necessarily piping hot when I received them still had a neat taste to them.  They seemed to be coated and have a spicy sauce on them as well as being mixed with bean sprouts.  The taste is really nice and for 7 bucks I guess they are pushing the food truck prices too.  This place for what we ordered was just OK.  The fries were really good and the chicken was just OK.  

Honestly I left with the feeling that this place was a little overpriced and perhaps a bit overrated.  Perhaps I would have felt differently if I wasn't served the cheapest cuts of chicken it wasn't priced as it was. 

It probably didn't help that the KFC at the County General which I had just hours ago pretty much blew me and my friend away with the kind of presentation that I've never had before for KFC which includes over a half dozen places in Toronto and 4 other places in NYC, Chicago and Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"*LUNCH REVIEW ONLY*
Elvis Presley is one of my favourite crooners of all time.  Maybe it's his hip swaying, or simply the glimmer in his eye - whatever it is I love this king (of rock).

The first time I encountered Fidel Gastro's was at a Toronto Underground Market (TUM) event and it was their bust of Elvis that drew me to the table, but their energy and enthusiasm that made me want to sample their food.  This TUM-success, founded by Matt Basile, has gone from pop-up vendor, to food truck owner.  And now the cuisine of Fidel Gastro's has a permanent home with the opening of Lisa Marie, where he's still serving up his signature Sgt. Slather sandwich, alongside new menu offerings.

The dinner menu consists of cicchetti which, as the scroll of text above the bar describes as \"Kind of like tapas... but not really.\"  They more recently started serving lunch, and on a leisurely afternoon I decided to check them out.

Their lunch menu consists (as at the time of this blog post) solely of sandwiches.  On this particular day there were 5 options including the signature Sgt. Slather with your choice of 2 sides (salad or \"Pad Thai\" fries).

I opted for the Root-Beer Braised Beef Short Rib sandwich with kimchi and a side of fries.  I put \"Pad Thai\" in quotation marks as the fries to me were more like Tobasco fries with the elements of sweet and sour lacking in the mix.   Labels aside, the fries were still delicious.  The short ribs for me were lacking in flavour, be it the sweetness I expected out of association with a sugar-laden soda (maybe even as a component of some sort of caramelized glaze) - there just wasn't a whole lot of flavour in the meat itself, though it was definitely tender.  The kimchi provided all the flavour in the sandwich, though I would say that this is a kimchi that tries to appeal to the masses instead of picking an identity and sticking to it.  It wasn't particularly spicy nor particularly dominant in either radish or cabbage.  More of a \"playing it safe\" kimchi.

We also ordered the Paisano sandwich with a side salad which was everything you could possibly hope for in a spaghetti and meatball sandwich.  The spaghetti was cooked al dente (no doubt in salt water as the noodles themselves were flavourful), with a nice crust to it (reminded me of baked spaghetti).  The meatballs were moist and tender and the tomato sauce was delicious!  The salad was minimalist with mixed greens tossed in a tangy vinaigrette.

The cocktails also deserve praise, specifically the Malocchio Sour made from Sailor Jerry's (rum), egg whites and limonata - like an adult cream soda!  I also tried the Testa Dura because I love Tromba tequila and it was also a nice refreshing drink - perfect for summer sipping.

The cost of lunch with 2 drinks came just shy of $50 which is a bit steep for a sandwich combo-lunch.  However, given my love for the FG team, I will most likely return to check out the cicchetti and for a few more Malocchio Sours ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot with a decent amount of seating. Anytime you go on the weekend try to get a reservation in case it's packed. We were lucky to get in as a group of 3 in 15 mins. 

The best part of our brunches we're definitely the pad Thai fries - so I highly recommend that! (The only thing for vegetarians is that they are definitely cooked in meat lard of some sort, I checked with the kitchen.) 

The rest of our brunch was honestly so-so. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat the egg white Frittata again. 

They had some pretty good deals on coffee and baileys for $3, but other than that, not too many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I enjoyed an amazing brunch at Lisa Marie on Sunday. It's now Tuesday and I'm still thinking about how delicious it was and how I want to try everything else on the menu. 

I had the bacon explosion Benedict and those pork patties are oh.so.good."}
{"text":"I just came here tonight for Valentine's Day and was not really happy with anything I ordered. The only good thing was the pad Thai fries which I noticed almost every table there had. I want to go again on a Wednesday to try the spaghetti and meatballs which is a Wednesday special. There was nothing I was really excited to order. 
Overall it was a nice atmosphere ! They had a live singer and pianist singing classic love songs in the spirit of Valentine's Day !"}
{"text":"Had brunch there this morning and definitely a thumbs up.  I ordered the bacon and eggs benedict, with pad thai fries.  The eggs benny was delicious, but I was not a fan of the brioche bun, which they use instead of a traditional english muffin.  The pad thai fries MADE the dish, however!  The fries were savoury, spicy, and doused in pad thai sauce - but still crispy & absolutely delicious.  The ambiance was non-traditional, shared tables and a bit on the loud side, but wouldn't stop us from eating there again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and really enjoyed it both times. I got the bacon eggs benedict, and my partner got the cornish hen on waffle. The drinks are really good too - I have had the mimosa, the one with kahlua and coffee, and the lemon beer drink. I love the creativity and taste of the meals. The pad thai fries are yummy and the sauce that comes with them is really spicy so beware!

Service has been excellent and friendly too. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Brunched at Lisa Marie this morning with a deep fry fanatic, long time friend. 

Ambience: 4.5/5
Laid back, chill music at a decent volume. One small TV that didn't distract (showing the world cup games - not factored into the review, but nice bonus!)
Seating was a little awkward for me- high stools that were more suitable for drinks after work rather than brunch.

Service: 5/5
Hipster with a smile! I never picked up the bearded server's name, but he was able to answer my questions about the menu, check in on us an appropriate number of times, and was generally lovely.  

Food: 4/5
The brunch menu seemed more like lunch+ eggs. Salad with a poached egg, steak with egg, mcgriddle esque pancakes and pulled pork on steroids. 
Generally, I like to have some sweet options (e.g. pancakes/ crepes). Also, everything, except for the salad, has meat in it. For these reasons, maybe not my go-to brunch place, BUT, they did have a good variety of options, without being overwhelming. Oh,

He got the bacon explosion sided with pad thai fries- basically an eggs benny with a generous hunk of peameal bacon. My taste of his brunch was pretty yummy: egg was perfectly poached, good crisp on the underlying bun/ brioche, and well formed hollandaise. Over all, it was a little salty for my taste, but friend was delighted.

I got the chicken and waffles, sided with pad thai fries. Half a cornish game hen, on a crescent of jalapeño cornbread waffles. Chicken was delicious- juicy and tender, nice crust, though maybe a little greasy at times.

Pad thai fries were really good initially. Little spicy; crispy and gooey at the same time. Later in the meal, they did appear soggy though. 

Overall, food was really good. Very generous portions. Very tasty (though, a little greasy and a little salty...). 

So, we're sort of between a 4 and a 5. But due to the noted gaps in the menu, and just in comparison to the diversity of brunches in Toronto, I'm rounding down to a 4.
I would go back, for sure- but Lisa Marie wouldn't be my go to."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 others for the smoke plate, a few of their app plates, cocktails and the Elvis dessert. 
Amazing service, great food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Fidel Gastro's food truck offerings, so the next step in my Matt Basile food experience naturally involved paying a visit to his relatively new brick-and-mortar restaurant Lisa Marie.

We must of chose an awkward day to visit, because once we were seated we were promptly informed that menu was going to change the very next day.  That being said, we still ended up having a terrific meal and there was only one item that we attempted to order that was unavailable due to the impending menu restructuring.

My fiancé is a selective eater, and I could see the apprehension settling over him as he looked at a menu full of things he was unfamiliar with.  I compromised and told him that we would order a few things and if he was unhappy we could go get something else after.  That second trip never happened.

We ordered four items from the cicchetti menu, with the wall above the bar informing me that cicchetti is kind of like tapas...but not.  We opted for the $7 deep-fried pizza (meatball, arugula, and tomato braised white beans on deep fried dough), the $7 sangweech (a deep friend masterpiece of mozzarella and veal bone marrow on focaccia), the $5 polenta patty (short ribs on a polenta cake), and the $5 cheese thang (pork belly on a Havarti cheese crisp).  The food came on a large tray so we could pick and choose what we wanted.

Disclaimer: it doesn't seem like a lot of food when arrives, but believe me when I tell you that it is.  We ended up ordering a second round of both the sangweech and polenta patty, and were subsequently very embarrassed when we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant having been rendered spherical by the sheer amount of food we had just ingested.

Everything was delicious, but for me the real standout was the polenta patty.  I had never eaten polenta and I found the soft grainy texture quite complimentary to the melt-in-your-mouth short ribs.  The sangweech was also incredible.  The bone marrow was salty and went down smoothly, and the mozzarella was a great addition.  In general, every different type of meat I tasted ended up being some of the most tender I have ever experienced.  The pork belly felt like it dissolved on my tongue the moment it passed my lips.

All in all, we would both definitely visit again, though we would give ourselves a bit more time before ordering more food.  Matt didn't let me down, and I can't wait to see what new sharable delights will grace his menu in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for their Tuesday night Beer, Burger & Bingo. It was for a friend's birthday and they sat us at two large tables next to each other. It was such a fun night! The burgers were delicious and so filling, and I had to try the pad thai fries. They were good although I prefer regular fries. The Bingo started at 7:30 and the owner was the MC. He had such great energy and was hilarious. We luckiliy hit the B12 ball during the B12 round so the whole place got a round of free shots. The place really cleared out when Bingo ended around 9, but we stayed for another drink until we felt we were forcing them to keep the place open. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Was there for a Sunday brunch. The fried Cornish hen n waffles is great. While the bacon explosion eggs Benny was just meh. Pad Thai fries were unique and fantastic"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2018 with my girlfriends and it was delicious! Super cute resto with unique decor/wall art and the live band was a great touch. 

Service was amazing. Our server was super friendly! I would definitely go back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Pad. Thai. Fries. Enough said. Went for brunch with a big group, service wasn't great (our server failed to take our order for far too long and we were all starving) but once the food came we were happy as clams because it was delicious. The mimosas are a little pricey in my opinion but I just moved pretty close so I think I might become a brunch regular!"}
{"text":"Came here about 2 weeks ago and arrived early around 545pm.

There were lots of seats available except for the window seats, I would highly recommend those seats as you can get some breeze and you won't get overwhelmed by all the echo'ing from the odd acoustics more inside the restaurant.

Although I was only a table for 2, the server obliged my request for the one of the bench tables, typically I try to avoid the high chairs as dangling feet eventually leads to my legs falling asleep lol.

Service was awesome and Matt himself even came around to check up on tables, I've watched a few Fidel Gastro Rebel without a kitchen tv shows so I was kinda swooned by tried not to show it.

Onto the food:

Turkey wings: Gigantic biggest wings I've had, I had in hoisin and it was a great flavor and the turkey wasn't tough either. 

Bone Marrow sandwhich: Fried to perfection but to be honest I only tasted very little bone marrow.

Eggplant in a jar: Was quite good but couldn't particularly taste the eggplant but overall it tasted good.

The special for the week, Sugo: basically pork belly and shoulder in sauce with bread, was reallllyyy good, a good amount of pork as well. I actually ended up packing this and have it with pasta the next day.

I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best brunch I have ever had so far! My friend and I came here on a late Sunday morning. The decor of this restaurant gives it a very cool vibe. The waitress seated us at one of their wooden communal tables with steel stools. I ordered their Fried Cornish Hen & Corn Bread Waffles. The waffles also came with maple syrup. This mixture of crispy, soft, savoury, and sweet created a taste explosion in my mouth!
I also tried a bit of my friend's Double Pancake Pork Burgers with Pad Thai Fries. The fries were somewhat spicy, which I thought was an interesting twist on the traditional fries. This new creation of pop-up king Matt Basile (you might have heard his name mentioned in association with the Fidel Gastro food truck) is definitely a must-try in my books!"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place! Kickass cocktails, drool worthy menu, above average service and a DJ that will make it impossible to stay in your seat. My fave go-to spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch twice and both times they have messed up my order. They have also been  understaffed, so don't expect much in the way of service. The food is good, but the lack of service and cramped tables make for an uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Worth the trip! Most to least favourite:

1. Carolina Fried Chicken- ~$19  (Classic fried chicken smothered in Carolina mustard bbq sauce with grilled corn bread and pickles)
Perfectly good fried chicken. Juicy interior. Savoury and crispy outside.

2. Herb Roasted Heirloom Carrot Salad-with carmellized tomatoes, dill yoghurt, carrot tips
Nice substitute for fries. Carrot pieces were long!

3. Argentina Smoked Steak-Smoked AAA picanha steak, carmellized cipponlini onions, charred squash puree and chimchurri
Nice flavour from the chimchurri. I enjoyed the squash and onions more than the steak though because the steak was charred and was a little tough on the outside and sinuey on the inside

Dessert:

1. Apple Hand Pie-Homemade flaky crust and honey crisp apple filling
I loved this.

2. Sailor Cherry Cheesecake in a Jar-With sour cherry, spiced rum and oreo crumb
Very sweet."}
{"text":"Most Memorable Feature: Comfort food in a pan

Came here on a double date for Summerlicious dinner and it was amazing.  Cool vibe, helpful staff, and we got a seat right by the sidewalk.  The food is great value regardless of prix fixe or a la carte.  Mains were a little bit on the dry end but the deep fried Nashville Hot Chicken was crispy enough to make up for it.  Desserts were really cute but portions could have been a little bigger.  I came here expecting Queen Street-esque aesthetics and cheap comfort food and they delivered.  Overall, not bad for $28!

Dishes ordered: Alabama Tailgaters, Tuna Ceviche Nachos, House Smoked Ribs, Nashville Hot Chicken, Summer Fruit Crumble with crème anglaise, Key Lime Pie in a Jar"}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had in Toronto! Pork burger with freaking pancakes for buns! Of course a side of maple syrup. The pad Thai fries have a really good, unique taste but are quite spicy so be warned!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at Lisa Marie.

Main cons:
1. Extremely slow service 
2. Food is average at best 
3. Food arrived cold when they finally decided to bring it out."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on a Friday night with a gf and were provided the options of being jammed in a the middle of a 6 person table next to two couples or the two chairs at the bar. We tried out 4 of the dishes and couldnt even eat two of them. The pork taco type thing was dry and not even edible. When I ordered another dish I found big hunks of fat. It grossed me out. The service was decent and they took 50% off the item we didn't eat and apologized. Not running back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"See full video review here: https://youtu.be/SDSoRZ0-TqI The Alabama tailgaters are boss. Always a fan of bacon wrapped meat. The Pad Thai Fries are essential if u are going."}
{"text":"Dinning Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Fusion Tapas
Menu items: Aperol Spritz, Malocchio Sour, Eggplant in a Jar, The Turkey Wing, Short Rib Polenta Patty, Deep Fried Pizza, Pork Belly Cheese Thang, Fresh Tuna Puttanesca & Elvis in a Jar

Close to 3 months ago a new trendy restaurant, with an homage to Elvis, opened its doors to Toronto crowds. Lisa Marie, an inspiration by the creator and owner of the famous Fidel Gastro's food truck, was born. Quickly becoming one of the most popular food spots on Queen West, Lisa Marie has hit high marks in my books and stolen my heart away. Here's how...

With a tapas-inspired menu, Lisa is all about the food, the flavours and the mixing and matching of unique ingredients that make up the 15 for so food items on the menu. Like the Eggplant in a Jar ($5), a funky mixture of  thai chilies, zucchini chips, brined eggplant and tallegio cheese. All mixed and baked in a small jar, enough to give two people 4 good spoons of a taste.

Next to it, a crazy big Turkey Wing ($7) that has been marinated in a hoisin chili sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and topped with green onion. A sweet piece of meat that is rather tender and juicy. Making things even more interesting, I find myself inquiring about the Short Rib Polenta Patty ($5). More like a Spanish montadito, the meat is braised in beer and served atop a smoked tomato and parmesan charred polenta cake. The polenta is not crumbly or dry, rather it's moist with a smooth texture.

On its complete opposite end, there is a Deep Fried Pizza ($8), which just blows my mind away. As base, a fried pizza dough; on top, smoke duck with duck skin chicharron (rind), hoisin sauce and an asparagus slaw. That perfect sweetness from the hoisin is nicely balanced with the greasy and salty taste of the duck.

The Pad Thai Fries ($6), part of the featured menu of the day, were probably one of the best spicy foods I've had. In spite of having a low tolerance for heat, I devoured these babies in the blink of an eye. With a perfect deep fry, a crunchy texture and a nice dusting of siracha, butter and lime juice sauce, these fries left me longing for more. A newly discovered addiction for me.

The same night, a light and refreshing arugula salad, was also featured at Lisa Marie. For some odd reason I decided to offset the spiciness of the fries with this salad, which created a whole new flavour in my palate; leading me to start mixing the salad with the fries. It was that lemony taste from the dressing, accompanied by the bitterness of the arugula and the sweetness of the red bell peppers that made this creation a success. We even told the waitress we had a new menu item in the works for the chef!

The most greasy \"thang\" we enjoyed about the menu was the Pork Belly Cheese Thang ($5). Nothing beats a good ol' smoked pork belly, sitting on a bed of fried crunchy cheese, topped with a cilantro cherry tomato salsa, all  drizzled in a chili basil aioli. Now that is decadence at its best.

And so we finally come to Lisa Marie's masterpiece, the Elvis in a Jar ($6). A layered and blended mix of bananas, french toast, maple syrup, peanuts and peanut butter whipped cream topped with a candied spiced bacon. Sweet on bite, smooth on the palate and tasty all over. After all, wasn't Lisa's masterpiece always Elvis?

Tip: Sauces, marinated meats and pickles are also for sale from an in-house mini-market at the back of the restaurant.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Must have caught them on a bad day. Heard such great things about this place that when I finally got there I was bound to be disappointed. 

The food was complex on the menu but fairly simplistic on the plate. I ordered the eggs Benedict, which came with a large bland pork patty on top of two English muffins smothered in very bland hollandaise, plated with super soggy potatoes drenched in hot sauce (pad thai fries per the menu). 

Decor is very cool but this was quickly offset by the price ($16 for Benedict). Staff were hospitable  and friendly but quite slow for first thing on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Lots of likes for this place so we gave it a try. For all the complaints that I have read about service, we were treated well, our waitress was attentive, helpful and did what a waiter should do, make sure we were happy, full and informed. My colleague spilled part of my drink, our fault, it happens, she got me a new one without me having to ask. Now for the food. The food is interesting, I actually liked the Pad Thai fries, I thought what a dumb thing but it works, I don't know how but it does, as for the other food. First off they know how to deep fry. It is an art and they have it down but the food is either too salty or too sweet. The fish taco was way too salty, the cauliflower and the chicken we ordered sugary sauce. I know people like it but it is a mask of good food, people like sugar and salt but it should not be what you taste. As for the drinks, I would come back, a good bartender making interesting cocktails."}
{"text":"It was about time I checked this place out.  I respect Matt very much because he is really changing the game.  Not only does he own a resto, 2 food trucks, and a catering company but he also has a show on Travel....dude how do you keep up?

With all that you think \"ya but he doesn't still cook in the kitchen\" WRONG...dude is in the kitchen cooking and mingling with clients.

I love the way he does everything and it is exactly what I would do if I was him too so I can relate.  After he traveled the US he came back and recognized something we don't do here enough, support the local business.  Thursday night he has a #tapthat night where he has $3 half pints of local breweries, which changes every week.  We had the pleasure of trying Junction Brewery which was awesome.  Next week it is Mill St premiering their new beers.

I've always believed that we should work together (support local) and put Toronto on the map and he is doing that, good on you.

The food was AMAZE BALLS!!!! Funny enough one of my favs was the pad thai fries lol but everything was so good.  We also ordered the salad, eggplant meatballs, tostada, deep fried pizza, and much more.  One thing we all loved was the names he used for the drinks and dessert.  They had these pumpkin doughtnuts called \"Daft Pumpkin Doughtnuts\" LOL

I was a fan before but now I am a bigger fan.  The people with me even said this was the one of the best restos they have been to because of the food, vibe, service, and all around feel of the place.  It felt very comfortable like you were at a friend's house and they were cooking for you.

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Very good brunch with original tastes! Unfortunately, not a lot of choices for sweet lovers but the salty menu is great! 
Great staff. Reservation possible, that's a plus! I recommend"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot of this place of how good it is. Walk by a lot and always see it full. So what was good? Definitely the Pad Thai Fries. Kind of like a poutine but with siracha, been sprouts. You know what's missing though from a pad thai? peanuts!

The porchetta tostadas and tuna ceviche nachos were decent. Wasn't full yet so we added Double Pork dumplings which were good, super hot but you gotta put the whole thing in your mouth cause the goodness inside kinda leaks out! Being Chinese I usually never order dumplings but why not! They were pretty good.

One thing I found is if you don't eat beef, I find the options kind of limited. Overall some good items and many just decent items. So why is this Lisa Marie? No idea? I wish the would tell me who she is!"}
{"text":"I called last minute to make a reservation for summerlicious, and the man who answered the phone was super sweet and accommodating about it. He was friendly on arrival and attentive throughout the meal (in addition to our server). This spot is very busy so don't plan to go in and get out in a hurry. The food was good for a prix fixe. Everything was served at the right temperature, and I enjoyed the fresh heirloom tomatoes in the salad. Skip the sangria as it's a bit watered-down and go for a bottle of wine instead. The food didn't blow me away, but it's comfort food so I'm not sure how much you can really \"elevate\" it. Overall, I'll be back for the friendly service."}
{"text":"Recently went her for my anniversary and ordered more than half their menu.  I absolutely loved everything I had and would have trouble picking a favorite.  

The staff was really cool and the place had a great atmosphere to it.  We were there kind of early bit it did start to get busy as we left. 

The only problem is the west end is infested with mean homeless so you will be accosted to and from the Resturant ad if the windows are open even while you are eating but that's just the area."}
{"text":"The problem with Lisa Marie is the wait - we arrived at 11:20 am on a Saturday, and the place was fully seated with those who had arrived for the 11:00 am opening time. The hostess took our phone number and said it would be 30-35 minutes. When we failed to get a phone call, we came back to the restaurant to check what had happened. We were told it would be another 15 minutes. Unfortunately, we were not actually seated until around 12:45 and THEN had to wait another half hour to get our food. For this reason alone I could not give this restaurant any higher than 3 stars - the food was good, but not great, and certainly not worth such a long wait. I had the smoked salmon open face sandwich and duck fat fries, and was disappointed by the fries. The sandwich had maybe 3 capers on it. I also tried the pad thai fries, which were soggy. My recommendation to the restaurant is to be honest about wait times so at least customers know what to expect."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this restaurant since I've been a follower of Fidel Gastro's food truck and a fan of Chef Matt Basile's tv show 'Rebel Without a Kitchen'. I love his unpretentious and unique way of cooking.

So what better time to check out this restaurant than Summerlicious. We started with Alabama Tailgaters and Tuna Ceviche Nachos for our appetizers, both we enjoyed. The bacon wrapped beef tenderloin is so moist and flavourful and the marinated tuna served over the nachos tasted so different from the other nachos I've eaten.

When the Mains arrived this is where it went downhill. The House Smoked Ribs is so fatty and sweet that I can't even force myself to eat them. I think this is the worst ribs I've ever eaten! My partner ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and there's nothing spicy about it. In fact the chicken is so dry and tough that you feel like you're eating a hard rock.

Don't even get me started on the dessert! We ordered the French toast and Summer Fruit Crumble and both came in a small jar. We tried them and both tasted awful!

Overall this is one disappointing experience especially if your expectations are high! We were still hungry after leaving the restaurant. 

We're just glad that we tried the prix fixe menu and not their regular menu.  I know one thing is for sure, we will never ever set foot in this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"There's brunch, and then there's BRUNCH like these folks do it. They'll charge you an arm for a brunch of champions and then fill your stomach up to the point of near-explosion.

Whether you are familiar or not with Matt Basile's quick-rising Fidel Gastro regime of food trucks and even a TV show, one encounter with his brand of cuisine is usually enough for anyone to grasp the creative talents of this local empire. Take their Burger Week offering for example: Nutella burger. Who'd thought of using bloody nutella in a burger? But put that mutant thing in your mouth, and it somehow works! The guy makes the unlikely of comfort food combinations work together.

So I come in to Matt's brick-and-mortar Queen West restaurant for an early Saturday brunch meal. The place is light on the Elvis theme, and heavy on the exposed brick-and-mortar and 80s pop/rock soundtrack. Definitely heavy on the portions.

I immediately without question settled on the Double pancakes pork burger ($14). Imagine a harmonious blend of breakfast and lunch, about the size of two McDonalds Big Macs, and taste so much more heavenly than a Big Mac or Burger's Priest bomber will ever be... love me tender, love me sweet; it is too awesome to put into words. The patties were firm and goes well with the soft pancake 'buns'. I had it with a side of their Pad Thai fries, which was like a party in my mouth. So full from all that amazing pile of carbohydrates dancing down into my tummy, I could die happy.

I did also try their home fries, which is coated with Dijon mustard, a great high tang unless you hate mustard. Gotta admire though the thoughtful fun and commitment put into the food and the business. And the comfortable environment and great level of service--the food comes fast, too! And the perfectly sunny side up egg. The amazing grub here is like a greasy spoon joint elevated to another dimension.

{"text":"The food and vibe here is good. It can be noisy with the live band and it can get hard to hear people especially if the people you are with have quiet voices. So basically we sat and ate with little conversation.

First thing was the checkin discount of 10% could not be applied, the waitress claimed it was only available for takeout. Who checkins when ordering takeout and who takes out tapas, anyways im not going to argue. 

My favorite was the tuna nachos. The kung pow cauliflower was too sweet, soft and too much batter. The lamb ragout was ok, it was our shared main and it was sub par. 

I would repeat if invited but i dont think ill come here again as a planned dinner. I may try their brunch though."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends and we had the table in the back.  I think the A/C was broken b/c we were sweating bullets (we came in September - I'm just late in posting this review).  They had a fan going but it did little in the way of cooling down the space.  The floor also for some odd reason was extremely sticky at the back.  I don't even want to know...lol

I ordered the shakshuka and I was a bit underwhelmed - I've had this dish at other restaurants and while of course there is variety in the way it is made, I felt this was one of the poorer versions.  It was chunky, tasted tinny and not very flavourful.  I took half of it home but didn't eat it.  It just wasn't worth it.  

The server was really nice and even when we asked for some lemon slices she didn't bait an eye and brought them right over.  She was friendly and joked around with us - for that I gave this review an extra star (I would have given 2)"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend, the place was very crowded so we put our names on the waiting list and went for a walk since it was a very lively street. We came about 25 mns after and sat down at a table. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered the shashuka (?) the ovo toast with egg& cherry french toast which was the day's special. Everything was so good and came in less than 40 mns. Great music and the vibe is amazing ."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city and the service is fantastic. The line-ups are long but well worth the wait. Bacon explosion eggs Benedict with duck fat fries, the best comfort food for brunch!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the location is nice, the spot is well decorated and trendy.
2 veggie options in the brunch menu, which is cool.
The eggplant dish was really nice, from what I recall (I ordered it two years ago).
Went there last weekend again and I took the California Benny.
The eggs were really nice, although almost cold.
The Pad Thai fries, which is one of their iconic dish, were actually not that great. Too spicy to be enjoyed fully.
My friends took the duck fat fries, which were okay, but not amazing either."}
{"text":"Saw their review on BlogTO, and just HAD to come here for brunch. This place does not fail to disappoint.

It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's completely worth it and filling. I got the house special which was braised ribs with an underside of mashed potatoes, topped off with an sunnyside egg. It was sooooo good. 

*Pro-tip: If you like spicy, FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD, ASK FOR THEIR HOT SAUCE. It's homemade and it's has more of a jam consistency. It's spicy and sweet and hits the spot. 

The servers are helpful, even with their busy brunch rush! Their decor is beautiful and really vinage-y with wooden seating. 

One last thing: PAD THAI FRIES. MMM."}
{"text":"I ordered the shakshouka which was too healthy. It was not baked, seemed like they made a large pot in the morning and gives everyone that. It was not even hot. Barely any egg in there too. My friends had the Benny and the pancakes which were delicious and of course the pad Thai. Waitress is quite rude and the place is very loud. It's alright but don't order the shakshouka."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I were determined to have a Sunday brunch session. We had to wake up for an early yoga session to head here! We made reservations at Lisa Marie beforehand but we still had to wait 15-20 mins for our table -_-...
Service was okay.

SHAKSHUKAH (3/5)
(Eggs baked in a spicy tomato sauce with roasted peppers, eggplant, zucchini and red onions, topped with crumbled feta and served with rustic bread)

The first bite was SO GOOD! Then it went downhill because the taste gets bland from there. It's the same flavour throughout. I was getting so tired of the taste half way into my meal, same goes for my friend. We both had to snatch some food off of our friend, who ordered the LAMB SHANK AND GRITS - who ALSO had the same problem with the blandness of her meal. All in all, I would recommend a group to share these brunch items that I've mentioned to avoid blandness.

Side note: My friends who ordered the fried chicken highly recommends it!"}
{"text":"Two things intrigued me about this place. First, the name. It must be about Elvis was my thought ( correcto!) . Second, the heart attack on a plate menu.

I researched before hand photos and menu suggestions as well as reviews of the history of the owner. All awesome! So this food gal couldn't wait to go!

Fried, double stacks, gravy is often found in your choices.  Double pancake pork burger, anyone? Dear god! Deep fried pizza dough topped with pulled pork chili and a poached egg? The brunch menu is full of combinations that say...WTF. I mean that.
We were all a little perplexed.

I chose based on what the waitress said was the most popular at the time: egg, sausagey gravy, poached egg and side of pad Thai she suggested. I have to say the most exciting part was reading the menu than trying the food. 

 The egg was perfectly cooked and the biscuit was good but the gravy tasted the way it looked. The gravy was abysmal. The pad Thai fries were not too thrilling except that it was spicy. For the name they gave it, it was not very pad Thai in flavour. Spicy yes, but not pad Thai.

Perhaps dinner is the shining star but for brunch, I cannot say it's rather limited menu makes me want to return.

Overall: unspectacular."}
{"text":"I came across this brunch place when I was yelping for places to eat in Toronto and this place popped up. And I could say that I'm super happy I came here because it really does live up to the hype. The pad Thai fries here are to die for and the s'mores pancake was perfect. It wasn't too sweet unlike other places and the pancakes were light and fluffy."}
{"text":"Brunch Brunch Brunch. The only thing I look forward to. I decided to go to Lisa Marie for Brunch when I tried the infamous Pad Thai Fries from the Fidel Gastro Food Truck. OMG those were foodgasmic. One of the better creations. 

The location is okay, it's a bit far west but I will travel for food. I walked in with my brunch buddy and sister. The first thing I ordered was a Caesar, after all it is brunch. I wanted to most outrageous thing for brunch so I ordered the Double Pancake Pork Burgers with Pad Thai Fries. 

Double stacked Pork Burgers with Pancakes as Buns with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. We also ordered the S'mores Pancakes which I wasn't a fan of. I'm not a s'mores person but if you are then you would probably like it.   

The service, food and atmosphere are nice. I have had better brunch though, the only reason this is getting one extra star is because of the pad thai fries. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food, because I wasn't actually able to go because their hours state that they are open from 11 AM on Saturday, but that's not the case as they actually close down mid-day and only reopen at 6. Showed up shortly after 5 to find the door locked, so we ended up going to a place further west on Queen. I would only give it a 2nd chance if they were to promptly put up their actual hours on their website so no one else wastes their time."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here recently for the first time, and was a bit disappointed! We had a reservation, though we were standing at the door for a while unsure of what to do as there was no host. This was the first stage of waiting a long time for everything. We waited for coffee for quite some time, and then waited for our order for over 45 mins. The server said the kitchen was understaffed, and we were understanding, but hungry! When the food finally arrived it was mostly really tasty. The peameal sandwich was good, and had almost like a pulled pork version of the bacon. Pad Thai fries were really good too, but very spicy! The frittata was underwhelming, but otherwise everyone enjoyed their meals. After waiting for our food we then waited for our bill for a long time as well and eventually gave up and went up to the bar to pay. Seemed like everyone was waiting a long time and the people who sat down next to us even took the cleaner sitting on their table and wiped it down themselves as the person who was about to clean it walked away while they waited to sit. 

Would be weary to try brunch here again, though I did really like that sandwich!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for brunch! I had the bacon eggs Benedict, the meal was ok except for the fact the potatoes were soaked in Dijon mustard (my fault for not reading the menu). We all got a drink so our bills were each over $40. For a more expensive brunch the service could have been more friendly. Also we had to share a table with others and sit on our coats on tall stools because there was no hooks! 

For an expensive brunch, I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends a while ago. This place gets pretty busy for brunch, so try to make a reservation or come first thing when the restaurant opens.

Some comments on the atmosphere... it has a fun vibe, but the music was really loud. Even though we were sitting at a table for four, we still had to shout just to hear each other and carry on a conversation. One other thing is that the tables by the window are super sunny at brunch time, so keep that in mind if you get a choice of tables...

On to the food! The bottomless coffee is just as good as any drip coffee in town. But their freshly squeezed orange juice, on the other hand, is only so-so. Their peameal bacon burger is fantastic. The peameal is juicy, though the burger itself can be a bit messy to eat (but I don't mind that). Their twist on a chicken and waffles is really good. The hen is fried really well, but beware of bones! Eggs benny is good too. The standout for me was their pad thai fries. Each fry was perfectly coated in their pad thai sauce and still really nice and crispy.

Will probably go again for brunch soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because I got some hate mail from somebody saying that I shouldn't hate on a restaurant just because they don't cater to vegetarians. This person was absolutely right but now I have more time to write full review. Our server took forever to get to us and we waited over an hour for our food. We were insanely hungry so we asked for some bread and the server said she didn't have any bread. It's a restaurant, they make sandwiches with bread. We asked our server if we could have anything at all to munch on while we waited for the food - she eventually brought us fries which she didn't comp. The bench seats were not comfy at all and after sitting for an hour, our asses were numb. It's an overpriced hipster restaurant that gives good hipster restaurants a bad name. The dishes are loaded with fattening stuff it doesn't take a talented chef to make those ingredients taste good."}
{"text":"I have a hard time classifying what kinda of food Lisa Marie serves. The roughest generalization is maybe amped up Canadian with Asian elements, all served under the watchful gaze of a limp eyed Elvis statue that looked like it was melting on one side. The menu has an mix of different elements, like kimchi beside the fried chicken or spicy green peas with the tailgaters. Some interesting unexpected choices to explore. 

The fried fish burger is delicious. A perfectly battered chunk of fresh flaky fish in a house made coconut bun, which came stacked high and regal looking. I devoured that thing without putting it down once. After hearing good things about the Elvis dessert, we had to give it a try. The best part had to the chunks of delicious caramelized bananas in the middle. It brought a much needed punch of texture and flavor to the otherwise light and kinda-bland dessert. Those chunks of bananas was like discovering chunks of gold, but it left the spoonfuls where it was missing a bit lackluster."}
{"text":"This place is the best. A great atmosphere and staff. we had drinks here one night and also had brunch. Both times were great. For brunch id recommend the s'mores pancakes and shakshuka ...both great."}
{"text":"Nice, hip place for dinner and drinks.  They have local craft beer on tap, which is nice to see.

Had the Sugo with a fresh baguette, dish was very good.

Highly recommend the \"Elvis in a jar\" dessert, a very rich creamy peanut butter, bacon, french toast dessert, was amazing.

Both atmosphere and service were great.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here on the Sunday after St Patrick's day. Was really looking forward to the hype about the food at this place. As we got there there was a couple leaving, the server said he would seat us there. After watching him go back and forth, he came back and forgot he promised us the seat and told us to leave our number so he could call us in 10 minutes... he seemed very overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in. We gave him a gentle reminder and sat us down in the spot he promised us. After about 10 minutes we finally got menus (sill no water at this point). Once we ordered (hen and waffles with pad Thai fries and s'mores pancake), we waited. Two other couples sat at the same table as us. We all were getting very frustrated, nearly 50 minutes later, our food finally arrived. I felt bad for the couple beside us, they didn't get their food till an hour later! The food was okay, definitely not worth the hype. The s'mores pancake was a good idea but way too rich. It should be a good challenge to finish this dish. The hen and waffles were alright, definitely not the best. They served it with a teaspoon of syrup. The waffle was very heavy so we didn't finish that. The pad Thai fries were good, the bean sprouts definitely balanced out the spiceyness of the fries. Overall the food was very heavy, it the waffle and pancakes were lighter and fluffier it would have been more enjoyable. Wouldn't recommend this place, won't be coming back all due to service issues."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and dinner, excellent food!!! I normally do not like fusion anything, Kimchee in what? Thai flavored fries and Mac and cheese? 
They mix flavors so well I am extremely impressed, just the right amount of spice in different dishes I love it. It's a little on the pricey side for everyday but it's unique that it's well worth it. Atmosphere is great, it's bumping, and a place to go on a Friday night AND Saturday morning! 

We loved the following: 
Double patty pancake burger 
Bacon explosion benny 
Thai fries 
Alabama tailgaters 
Thai curry Mac and cheese 
Carolina fried chicken"}
{"text":"I'd been to Lisa Marie a few times and enjoyed the eclectic menu, so when a friend suggested checking out their weekly Beers, Burgers, and Bingo event, I was only too happy to tag along.

I won't get into the bingo part, which was fun (if frustrating, since neither my friend nor I managed to win once), so instead I'll just talk about the food. To call it disappointing would be a major understatement.

The selection of burgers held a lot of promise, and after much deliberation, I elected to go with the Kimcheeseburger, which was topped with, among other things, a piece of deep-fried pork belly and some kimchi.

The toppings were fine, if unremarkable. No, the problem was the meat. Lean to the point of desert-like dryness, the patty was overcooked and burnt around the edges. It was very disappointing and almost inedible. My friend's burger arrived the same way, so this wasn't an isolated incident.

I imagine because they were cranking out so many burgers, the kitchen staff certainly weren't able to maintain any kind of quality control. But that's something they should've foreseen, especially considering this is a weekly event.

(Adding insult to injury was an inability to order dessert. An Elvis in a Jar might've salvaged the evening, but alas it wasn't to be.)

I'll return to Lisa Marie, but I'll never again order a hamburger from them."}
{"text":"I've been on a huge tapas kick lately so when Lisa Marie opened I was super excited to check it out, and a few weeks later, that's exactly what I did! :)

Lisa Marie specializes in Cicchetti, which is italian style Tapas.

The location itself is cute. At the front of a restaurant where it looks like a large window would be, is actually open, so if you're sitting up there it kind of give you a patio-type feel without actually being outside.

Most of the tables are large, communial style tables with barstools, with some smaller bench-like tables around also.

Fair warning: this place gets NOISY. It wasn't too bad when I first got there around 6:30, but as the night progressed it got louder & louder to the point where you really needed to shout to speak to people even very close to you. On top of the noise from talking, there is music in the background, but due to the fact that it's so noisy, all you really hear is the bass making more noise. Not my fav.

The menu is fun with a little something for everyone! Sharing plates for groups of people, lots of unique and interesting cicchetti to try out, and if you're not a fan of tapas style meals they also have a few daily specials of full sized meals (when we went it was some sort of fish sandwich, as well as steak.)

First I tried the MASSIVE buffalo turkey wing. They aren't kidding when they say this thing is massive! It was like a leg! The buffalo sauce drizzled with blue cheese was good. Nothing about the dish really \"wowed\" me, but I was glad that I got the buffalo style option instead of the hoisin - I tried a bit of the hoisin sauce and it was reallllly salty.

Next I tried the Deep Fried Cheeseburger which was, by far, my favourite dish of the night. A mini fried burger, topped with pickles & a quail egg. Simple, but delicious. When you cut into the burger the cheese oozes out. Mmmm. This would be perfect if the meat wasn't so well done. I would have liked it just a bit more rare. Regardless, still a very yummy dish!

& of course I had to try some dessert! I had the Elvis in a Jar which was a peanut butter cream, bananas, french toast, and candied bacon.

I love peanut butter.
I love bananas.
I love french toast.
I loved candied bacon.
I didn't love this dish, unfortunately (especially since I was so excited for it!!) The French Toast was chewy and a bit tough to get through. I think that this dish would have worked well if the french toast was softer, or if a cake was used instead. The dish just fell flat for me. I ended up wishing I had ordered the bone marrow donut to try instead.

Around the table the consensus was that there were some hits and misses, but I don't think anyone was really blown away by any of the food that was tried.

Overall I'd say Lisa Marie definitely has room for improvement, but the experience was fun and I'd definitely give this place another try once it's had some time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I have been going to Lisa Marie for a number of times now and this place never disappoints! From the choice of food, to their staff who work there.  
Two thumbs up all the way"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Sunday to the trendy  queen street west neighborhood. Parking was free on the street till 1 so we were able to find something close easily. My friend made a reservation a few weeks back so once we arrived they accommodated us pretty fast. The ambience was nice, very modern and rustic feeling. The fresh juice was great along with the grapefruit mimosa which I recommend. For my entree I got the California benny - which was an eggs Benedict type meal but with avocados - it was good- my husband got the s'mores pancakes and our friends enjoyed the shakshuka and this burger with a bun made out of pancakes that looked amazing. Side note - the pad Thai fries were delicious!!!! Service wasn't phenomenal but sufficient. Overall we enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and had a pretty good time.  The atmosphere was light and friendly.  Also, as a newer restaurant, the inside didn't have that \"stale\" air feeling that many older places tend to have.  

Our server was pretty awesome; he joked, and told us the history and inspiration of the restaurant.  When one of our drinks took a bit of time to reach us, he personally went to check.  It turns out they ran out of a certain alcohol so he offered us another drink of our choosing on the house.  He made sure we were well taken care of.  (He's the guy that sort of looks like Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark).  

Dishes tried:
Pork belly cheese thang - a bit bland and the shell was toasted so much it lost all traces of cheese flavour (miss)
Eggplant in a jar - tasty, but a bit too sweet even with the tomatoes adding acidity (indifferent)
Turkey wing - a giant turkey wing or drumstick.  It's fried on the outside so it has the same consistency of a giant pub-style chicken wing, but meatier. (hit)
Ravioli - it was drowned in an orange sauce which left no taste except orange ... (miss)
Philly cheese steak on a tostada - generous amounts of moist steak which was not so overpowered with the sauce.  The tostada it was served on remained crispy. (major hit!)
Elvis in a jar - a very rich creamy peanut butter, bacon, french toast dessert which was not too sweet and pleasant (hit)

Key points: 
- Overall, the food was very good with a few hits and misses.  
- Drink menu was a bit limited
- Service was a bit slow, but excellent when it was there
- Dinner for 2 (6 dishes, 2 drinks each) ~$70 after tax was a steal (very full)"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We had such high hopes and everything on the menu sounded amazing, but when the food arrived it felt like a great menu was all they had. The Seoul Fried Chicken tasted like General Tao with sriracha and the kimchi just tasted like it was soaking in brine for way too long. The carne asada was cold and chewy and the serving size was more like an app than a main.  

We at least hoped the desserts would make up for it but the Nutella Smores didn't even have Nutella in it and The Elvis was just bananas on wet bread with random bacon chunks. The acoustics are terrible, the steel wall just amplifies everything and the service was slow and inattentive. Big fans of Fidel Gastro but maybe just stick to food trucks?"}
{"text":"I have a great time whenever I go to Lisa Marie (which is fairly often because they have a great brunch and half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays).

I would say the one true standout item is the pad thai fries; I always end up getting them. One time at brunch my friend got the side of potatos and we all agreed that they were subpar in comparison to the pad thai fries.

I've had a few different items at brunch, the eggs benny and the fried cornish hen with cornbread waffles being my two favourites. There's always an insane amount of food on the plate and I typically leave with leftovers. Their coffee is also great (they even ask you if you'd like a side of milk, cream, or Bailey's).

I usually see the same servers and they're all really nice and helpful with great personalities. No bad attitudes or grumpy hungover brunch servers here.

If you're looking for a quiet place for brunch, this is *not* the place for you. Between the loud music and large volume of diners, this place gets noisy.

Overall, you should absolutely try Lisa Marie for brunch or a drink in the evening. Prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm too impressed with this place at least with one visit that I had, so please take this review with a good dose of salt.

We did walk in here for brunch on a nice sunny August afternoon and there was a bit of traffic, but there was still plenty of seating so we decided to eat here. 

I can't say Lisa Marie was great in terms of food. 

The BF said that the shrimp po boy was horrid - over battered, over cooked and completely flavourless.

Pad Thai fries were cold and over sauced and dominant flavor was sour. Not sweet, spicy and sour. Not quite sure how I feel about it - but I was pretty unimpressed with this place's food. 

Service - definitely needs improvement. When we walked in - they said to take a seat anywhere - so we did - only to be asked to move twice - so it is sit anywhere - but not really; which was pretty annoying.

The BF did laugh and mention that Lisa Marie had pretty much managed to push all my pet peeve buttons when I am dining out. 

I could say I'll come back here, but only if I have to come for a friend's thing and a good friend at that, otherwise I will just walk on by and try another place along the Queen West strip."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday weekend, the three of us, feeling extremely carnivorous.  Naturally, we ordered a smoked meat board with some beers and it was definitely a good time had.  The smoked meat board consisted of a sausage, roasted chicken, beef brisket, and some ribs.  

By far, the brisket was the absolutely best.  It was so tender and juicy and I can see why they told you to eat that first.  The ribs were also very delicious.  By the time we got to the sausage, we were either just really full or the sausage was genuinely not as great as the other two meats we first started with.  The beet mash and slaw they accompanied it with, were however, extremely delicious.  Finally, by the time we got to their chicken, we were having the meat sweats and nobody wanted to deal with it.  It was also a bit too brined for my liking and it ended up being way too mushy.  

Overall, I'd definitely visit this place again for a good time.  Definitely a good summer place to go to!"}
{"text":"Came in a Sunday at 1pm, waited 10mins for a seat, waited 50mins for food to be served.

Our waitress never smiled once, and the place was pretty packed with a lot of patrons waiting for food.

Tried the Cornish hen and cornbread waffles and the pork burger with pancakes and Dijon duck fat fries. Everything was very filling with ample amount of food. Pad Thai fries were cold when we received them but the food overall was reasonably priced. The Cornish hen coms with spicy hot sauce but couldn't taste any jalepeno in the waffles. 

They have a lot of high rise bench style seating so it was pretty squishy esp with our winter jackets but they have small hooks under the table for them.

Overall food was good, service needs to improve on the friendliness and attentiveness, ambiance was nice but pretty tight seating arrangements."}
{"text":"This place is so down home comfort food I can't get enough. I had a birthday brunch here and they were so accommodating and all the food was right (for 32 people that's impressive) and hot and on time. The service was extremely friendly and cheeky. And they definitely don't take themselves too seriously."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars to a place but this is one place I would go to again and again for their pad thai fries. They were truly one of a kind. I ordered the eggs benedict with smashed avocado and it was delicious. Definitely coming back here again"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, unique crowd that you couldn't pin point to just one 'type'. The food was good the pad Thai fries were great to share, and I couldn't not order the tuna nachos (tuna was like butter and had a generous serving of fish on them), tried the cereal fried fish sandwich, which was good and the Montreal smoked meat sandwich (substituted the hamburger patty for 'more' of the smoked meat but it wasn't a generous serving) I'd go back."}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" with John Catucci. I thought hmmm...it's in Toronto, I live close to Toronto so let's go! 

The show featured Pad Thai Fries as their main appie. They were right...they were absolutely delicious!! A little on the hot side but that made them just that much more delicious. The service was very good from smiling waitstaff & the place was jammed too. 

Our shared main was the Smokehouse Platter. Included Cola Beef, Potato salad, German Sausage, Pickles & Garlic Bread. All was good (beef was tender) but none of it really slapped me in the face. I have nothing bad to say about this place except it wasn't as good as the show made it out to be they they didn't honour a \"YELP\" coupon!! In my experience, these TV Shows ALWAYS make these places out to be better then they actually are, just saying."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor of the place are a nice touch. Service and wait time for the food could be improved. They run out of popular items regularly so come early if you have something specific in mind. Pad Thai Fries are pretty gross after a few and the rest of the menu is only mediocre but pretty good for the area and clientele."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Tried about 8 items on the menu and a couple dessert items. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. The Mac and cheese was probably my standout favourite. A good spot for a group to go and try a bunch of stuff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 11. They had sat us into two separate tables when they had a huge table in the back. I was surprise because it wasnt busy that night. Food was decent and the server was friendly."}
{"text":"3.5/5! 
I have been here three times and always had great experiences with this place. The servers were incredibly friendly and tentative, despite how busy the restaurant was.

-Seoul Fried Chicken - $19
The fried chicken doesn't have that typical super crispy skin that you would normally get from KFC or Popeyes, instead these had a super thin and ultra-crisp crust like the normal Korean Fried Chicken (which is what I prefer). These were cooked perfectly, super moist, flavourful and coated with a delicious spicy gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) sauce. The sauce was light, just a bit sweet, and right level of spiciness. Although the chicken was delicious, the sides disappointed me. The kimchi didn't ferment long enough, it tasted like the kimchi is in the in-between stages of being raw and ripe. Also, the kimchi was bland as it didn't have that salty and slightly sour taste I expected of kimchi :(. Same problem with the sweet potato noodle stir fry, bland and didn't taste like anything. 

-Sugo - $28
A must-order-item everytime I come to Lisa Marie! IT. IS. THAT.GOOD. OK. The sugo is an Italian meat sauce, with the brisket braised for 8 hours in a hearty tomato sauce and served with steaming hot home-made breads. Now follow me. Imagine taking a piece of bread, dip it into the red sauce, find chunks of meat (hurray), and eat it. What do you see? Do you see heaven? Do you see that light at the end of the tunnel? It's good right? RIGHT? Yea sorry I don't think I'm making sense here... but seriously I can just bath myself in this sauce LOL. I mean, the dish is so simple, yet it is so delicious.............Light, flavorful, right level of saltiness, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wow, the brunch was amazing here!  Came here last Saturday for brunch and the restaurant was packed--my cousins and I waited about 15-20 minutes for a table--not too bad.  I ordered the Fried Cornish hen and corn bread waffles, with a side of the Pad Thai fries.  Holy cow, the pad thai fries (fries cooked in pad thai sauce!!) were super spicy, but very delicious--my first time ever eating this type of fries.  The chicken and waffles was just as amazing (tip: make sure you dip the chicken in their hot sauce--adds more yummy flavor).  Ordered a glass of mimosa--even that tasted good.

All my other cousins loved their food too.  The portions are very generous and most of us barely were able to finish it all.  Service was awesome--we had two servers and they were super friendly and attentive.  Definitely would come back here!"}
{"text":"We walked home and stopped in to check out Lisa Marie (it was on our way home).

We sat at the bar and chatted with Andrew and Alla.

Just craft beer on tap, which is nice to see.  I ordered Gertz ... it was yummy!

 The restaurant opened in April 2013 by Fidel Castro, which started out as a food truck and expanded from there.  There is an interesting selection of food.

Andrew gave us a sample of candied bacon ... yum!

The restaurant used to be a Polish deli.  If you go towards the back, it still has that same old charm with lots of yummy things you can buy and take home.

We were going to buy some beer-yaki chicken to take home to cook for supper tonight but apparently the bags weren't seemed properly.  To compensate, Andrew gave us bottle of meat sugo to try ... looks good!

On the way to the bathrooms downstairs, you are encouraged to sign the wall ... so I did.

I liked Lisa Marie ... it's comfy and cozy and the staff is really friendly.  The food on the menu and in the deli section look delicious and I'd love to take home their beer-yaki chicken and buffalo chicken.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute brunch place. Of course we wanted to go to all the fancier popular spots in Toronto (not saying Lisa Marie is not popular) but we had other places in mind too. 
The staff here was so accommodating for a group of 4 and we got seats right away (15mins after we walking in on a Saturday early afternoon)
I was expecting a basic brunch menu, but I was so wrong. Anything you order from their brunch menu will be enjoyed. Everything we ordered was so flavourful and had an ethnic twist.
The Thai fries are so good! and I ended up putting my knife and fork down and just went savage on my fried chicken using my hands at the restaurant...people stared and I honestly couldn't careless :P LOL
The waffles were also made perfect ( to my liking) It was thick and crunchy on the outside, but moist and soft on the inside.  I wish everyone made their waffles like this :D *cough* Cafe Demetres *cough*"}
{"text":"Big time fan!
I really enjoyed the truck, glad to support the brick and mortar restaurant.
Booked on Open Table and was seated right away.
Nacho Tuna Ceviche was awesome. Lots of tasty tuna with a citrus kick...love it!

Will return for brunch!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for brunch last Saturday and ordered the Bacon Explosion Benedict: two smoked bacon patties topped with two poached eggs on brioche bread served with spicy hollandaise sauce; I chose pad thai fries as my side which it came with.  Food was good and the portions were great.  I don't typically like the long tables for communal seating, but we didn't have to share our table for our late brunch.  Service was friendly and loved the old school music playing in the background.  The restaurant had an inviting casual feel, great decor, and attentive service.   Will come back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had the Shakshuka and my friend had the steak and eggs. Also tried their cold brew from a bottle served in a glass of ice. Sort of the best thing I could have ever wished for for brunch. I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Checked this spot out with my girlfriend tonight after having a bad experience at another restaurant and I must say, we were very impressed.

The food was excellent and the service was great! As others have mentioned though, this place gets loud. So loud it can be hard to hear someone sitting directly across from you. To the owner, I would recommend a better sound system because while this one is loud, it didn't seem to be spread out well.

All in all, we had a great experience and will be back. Minus 1 star because the ambiance of 30 people shouting over Jay Z and Kanye West for 45 minutes kind of gives you a headache."}
{"text":"We came here to meet up with some old friends and to enjoy a nice drink together. Food and ambiance were perfect for a small group to catch up. There was live music and the food is shareable. Make sure you try the Pad Thai fries!"}
{"text":"I've dined here many times but this is my first time writing a review. I recently came here for winterlicious with a few of my girlfriends and we were not disappointed! They had a live band in house so that made dinner more enjoyable and our server was very attentive and patient. In addition to the prix frixe menu, we also made sure we ordered a side of their super addictive Pad Thai Fries (AMAZING)! Matt Basile is one of my favourite chefs here in Toronto and he has a very unique take on food. If you haven't tried Lisa Marie yet you can also catch him at pop ups at most food events like Taco Fest! :)"}
{"text":"VIBE 
What the old Prague Cafe lacked in atmosphere or buzz, Lisa Marie is making up for it - even if there's no hip swivel. It's less brunch, more dinner and late night drinks. I like that the food truck revolution is getting off the streets and onto Queen Street (is it just me or does Queen West need a complete makeover of more quirky places?!). 
It's a great open space with the Elvis murals, a lively bar and plenty of four tops for groups. Kudos! I only met Matt briefly but he's got a lot of energy and is a welcoming host. Ole! 

WE ATE
I was here for a private party so I don't know if I can accurately appraise the food. That said, when did deep fried become popular? I don't know. Not really a fan and it looks like there are more options to appease to those that don't want something fried and then  fried again (mozzarella and bone marrow sangweech, I'm looking at you). The tuna rolls were great, though. 

Great cocktail options. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Love me Tender but don't deep fry, pretty please. Are you Lonesome Tonight? Have a Testa Dura."}
{"text":"Overall decor and vibe is great and the dishes are innovative, but just not executed as well as I'd hoped. We came with a reservation and there was little to no line and waited 45 minutes for food, which was okay since the waiter was nice. Perhaps it was the holidays and they were under staffed? 

We got the pancake burger, the bacon eggs Benny, shakshukkah and the smoked fish club. The pancakes were slightly burnt but the combination of the meat and pancakes was great. The shakshukkah was way too overwhelmed with tomatoes so it was hard to taste anything else. The eggs Benny turned out to be fully cooked eggs on patties that we felt was too dry. The bread of the smoked fish club was also burnt. 

The one redeeming part of our meal was their pad Thai fries, which is what they're known for...but probably not worth the price of the meal. Stick to the food truck."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at Lisa Marie! If you didn't make reservations be prepared to wait or go sit at the bar as we did. We had fantastic conversations with the bartender & other guests alone the bar the whole night. Really made our night even more enjoyable! 

Must go back for their Saturday night meat platter special!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum...its good. Ate here with a group friends for a birthday. Was pleasently suprise d and impressed with various items on the menu. Service was great and the atmosphere was very inviting. Would go again. Definitely reccommend to readers viewing this. Cheers."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot! I like the interior and the food. My only complaint is that the bathrooms weren't very clean but other than that it's a nice spot to have brunch"}
{"text":"Drink are good and reasonably priced, and the food they serve are definitely meant to go with drinks. If you come here, come here with a bunch of friends to have a good time because it is casual place that can get loud quickly - don't come here on a date and expect intimate conversation time. 

There is live music on Thursday nights, which is great.

Food here seems to be an amalgamation of different cuisines and the dishes sound refreshing and new, but there are some hits and misses:

Pad thai fries - nice spicy kick but some commented that it was on the dry side, and that it didn't really taste like pad thai, more like buffalo fries (like the sauce for wings)

The kung pao cauliflower was nice - normally not a fan of cauliflower anything but the sauce made it enjoyable for me

The tuna ceviche nachos tasted ok but was on the small side; Thai green curry mac and cheese was awesome and I enjoyed it; Alabama tailgaters (bacon wrapped tenderloin stuffed with aged cheddar and kimchi) was tasty and I would recommend getting it. The Argentinian smoke steak was awesome and I would totally get it again. The Carolina fried chicken (with mustard bbq sauce and grilled corn bread) is also very good.

The desserts were interesting - The Elvis (broiche French toast with creme anglaise, brown sugar bananas and peanut butter cream and bacon) is to die for. The Sailor Cherry cheesecake (sour cherries with spiced rum and oreo crumb) was just ok to me.

There is a lot of potential for the food here at Lisa Marie, and I do appreciate that they do change up the menu from time to time to keep things fresh.

I would say definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I had the jalapeño waffles with fried chicken and a side of grapefruit mimosa. Some of the best fried chicken I've had in a long time! Crispy, crunchy, flavourful with little oily residue most are known for. Great little brunch spot"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I last dine here so I was looking forward to coming back here for some pad Thai fries.  One thing I didn't remember about this place was how lousy it is.  It's was really hard to hear the person sitting across from you,  you literally need to yell. Felt like I was at a night club at 11:00am. The communal sitting probably didn't help either.  

As for our meal, I have to say, I was really disappointed at my dish which was the special of the week - egg white veggie frittata. When I order a frittata, I'm thinking potatoes, cheese which both were absent from my dish.  It was just a lot of egg whites with pathetic amount of veggies.   On top of that, it has no taste and was drenched in oil.  The pad Thai fries were also a disappointment, it was soggy. 

The service was very slow, took a while for our orders to be taken and for us to get the waiter's attention for condiments and napkins through out the meal. I think this will be my last meal at Lisa Marie's (voluntarily)."}
{"text":"Because of the disappointing drinks situation, my dinner date and I agreed that while we were glad we gave Lisa Marie a try, we would not likely return anytime soon.

Our night began with a couple of cocktails. My Malocchio Sour ($12) was seriously lacking in alcoholic content. It truly tasted like nothing more than a frothy lemonade. Apparently, my friend was also really disappointed in her drink as well, so we decided to switch to wine. When the first glass arrived, we thought that the pathetically puny pour must have been an exception. However, three more glasses later, it was confirmed that 2oz was actually the rule. At $13 a glass for the Hidden Bench rose and $8 a glass for the Chateau des Charmes chardonnay (we had 3), we felt down right ripped off.

It would have made sense for us to head next door for more sensibly poured (not priced, since neighbouring prices are quite similar and we're okay with that) drinks if only our food didn't take so long to arrive. Instead of let this put a damper on our night though, we decided to just keep ordering. 

On the upside, we enjoyed the food. The turkey wings, well covered in hoisin sauce, were large and meaty. At first, I was skeptical about the Italian and Vietnamese flavour combo in the ahi tuna salad rolls, but it turns out you really can't taste the puttanesca at all. It would have been nice to get more mango sauce for dipping though. The eggplant in a jar was spicy and acidic (in a good way), but the soggy, tough zucchini chips were so bad that we didn't even protest when the server took the plate away without asking if we were finished with them.

Service in general was fine, but slow. We weren't starving and are generally leisurely diners, but long gaps between drinks and water service were duly noted. Leaving each table a carafe of water would make a lot more sense than having someone run around with two jugs in hand pouring half glasses non-stop."}
{"text":"Lisa Marie is situated on lively Queen St. West. The first thing you should know is that for restaurants in this area to thrive, considering the multitude of restos you have the power to bring your business to, they must either 1. be the best in their food category, or 2. have an eccentric menu and the right atmosphere in order to attract food mavens far and wide. Lisa Marie falls into the second category. You look at their menu everything makes you salivate. You're conflicted between 2-3 apps or 1 entree. You sure as heck will be picking from your partner or friends' plates.

I ordered the Thai green curry mac and cheese, the Jamaican oxtail beef patty served in a skillet, and pad thai fries. All classics with somewhat of a twist. The mac and cheese impressed me with great distinct green curry flavour. Had me wishing I ate slower to savour it longer. Would reorder.

The patty was simple but so gourmet. The filling was delicious. But the serving was not enough for even one person.

The pad thai fries left the least impression on me but is good for sharing.

Only comment I have is on the temperature. It was obvious the fries and mac and cheese were standing too long. The restaurant was not busy and all 3 dishes were expedited alone, so I'd expect they left the kitchen ASAP but this appears to not be the case.

Good place to bring friends but was not mind blown by the food. Would visit other places on my list before revisiting."}
{"text":"This location is a bit inaccessible, there is one step at the entrance. I went for a Saturday dinner and found it to be too dark and the music too loud. I didn't know they have communal sitting, even if you make a reservation. So if you're going with less than 6 people, you'll probably be sitting with a stranger. The chairs are bar stools, no back, and not that comfortable. I ordered the Pad Thai fries, which were good and spicy, but more Thai inspired. I also enjoyed the Montreal Smoked Patty Melt, the bread was toasted well. I didn't like The Elvis 7 desert, only thing I liked was the whipped cream."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for brunch and the place was really live. We were seated at the back and the table was big enough to accommodate for 10 of us

The service could use a big improvement. We had ordered coffees and our waitress came to see if we needed refill right after serving them to us - kinda defeated the purpose, and didn't see her again 'til the bills came. Safe to say we didn't get our coffees refilled 

On the other hand, the food was delicious. I had the steak and egg (forgot the name of the dish) and it came with an order of salad, pad Thai fries, or house fries. the steak was cooked to my liking (medium rare) and the egg was runny when I asked for it to be over medium. The pad Thai fries was different in a good way - savoury and tangy and the bean sprouts added a hint of freshness to it"}
{"text":"I polished a whole plate of 3/4 Seoul Chicken with their secret red sauce. 
Gluttony was my friend. I also shared half of the delicious Roasted cauliflower and having a taste of their Tuna Ceviche Nachos, which my friend and I agreed, was both satisfying and perfect for a light dinner. 
Needless to say I rolled home. My friend I praised the food and it's flavors for a good 10-15 minutes after we had left. 
I will definitely be back and I may be sharing -- maybe not - but should -- the Seoul Chicken."}
{"text":"i came here late on a saturday night because we could hear the music while walking by and it looked like a fun place to be!

it was so nice inside, the dj was playing such good music. there was seating on high tables if u wanted to just sit with your drink and observe the dancefloor or you could dance (there was cleared off space in the front of the restaurant). the crowd was a mix of people -kind of looked  like everyone knew each other. 

i didnt eat there just had some beers but i would totally come back for a chill dance place"}
{"text":"They do BRUNCH (not many other people have mentioned)

The food here was really incredible, but pricey for brunch (I think most items were between $15-17, which is on the steep end for brunch)

Luckily, the portions are HUGE - we saw stuff coming out of the kitchen and being two small females - decided to share the eggs benny, which turned out to be enough food. 

Food was delicious btw. Caesar is huge and $9 and equally delicious.

Music was just slightly too loud, but in the end we didn't mind because they were playing some seriously cool 80s movie soundtracks. 

Server and staff were very friendly and we didn't experience any slowness!"}
{"text":"Have now been here twice and am addicted to the Thai fries. Service can be a tad slow but they're all so friendly you kind of forget. Love that they have the healthy egg white option in the frittata which is also a good dish. That said, their corn waffle with the fried hen is sweet and salty and all of the yum."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Incredibly noisy. Service was poor. They brought coffee for my husband that wasn't hot and it took 15 mins for me to get a cup a tea. No spoon, just a mug with no place to out my tea bag. Food took a very long time and was average at best when it arrived. Also, the server was unfriendly and unhelpful. Husband would never return."}
{"text":"So excited that this restaurant has lunch now on Thursday's and Friday's. Split their smoked turkey club and a grilled cheese sandwich with a friend. Soo good!"}
{"text":"1.5 stars for the Thai green curry Mac and cheese. Other than that this place was bad. It's communal seating at high tops, the aluminum walls make it very loud to the point where my dinner date and I were texting each other from across the table so we could communicate. I actually saw two couples walk in, hear how noisy it was and just walk out. 
As for the food, the Mac and cheese was good. The smoked cauliflower was uncooked and raw so we each took a bite and sent it back. The Seoul chicken with kimchi consisted of 4 measly chicken legs with a heap of pathetic stale kimchi for $19. The secret sauce tasted like it came from a generic brand bottle. The fish tacos were hugely underwhelming with a light smattering of fish and corn across and wonder bread tortilla and no flavour. Again, $19 for 3. Our bill was almost $90 (we each had a $12 drink) yet we left hungry and majorly disappointed.
I was more confused about what the hype is... This couldn't have just been a bad menu update or off night. Not a good date spot at all unless you like scream talking. The whole experience was uncomfortable and annoying but the server was nice."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2017 (Dinner: $25)

Lisa Marie was the last restaurant I visited for my 2017 Summerlicious' run. I was hoping the best for last but was disappointed.

App:
Alabama Tailgaters
Tuna Ceviche Nachos

Main:
House Smoked Ribs
Nashville Hot Chicken

Main:
Elvis Brioche French Toast
Summer Fruit Crumble 

Nothing too excited but the Nashville Hot Chicken was not good. So dried and over seasoned that I could not even finished that. Now I know why everyone else in the restaurant all ordered the ribs.

I do enjoy their cocktails; Love my Buck & Co ($13) as it has candied ginger as one of the element!

Service was fast and friendly. 

I might be back for a drink or a snack but probably not a real dinner."}
{"text":"Liked this spot. Service was a bit odd with it being so empty the night we went. The host for some reason didn't want us sitting near the front. The food was good-pricy and small portions however. Will probably be back but won't be rushing there."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant. Small dishes, beer, drinks. The interior is nicely done and the atmosphere is laid back. The server and bartender were really nice.
I enjoyed my dishes, but I wouldn't describe them as phenomenal. The spicy cauliflower was really good, but pricey for the size. The tuna ceviche with chips was nice, but again, not enough tuna. Overall, nice experience. Will return."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday in the summer. The owner was actually bussing us food undercover and ended up chatting with us towards the end of the meal. He's a super chill guy, also owns the popular food truck Fidel Gastro, and he's on Food Network.

The food, as he explained, is a mix of Venetian street food and Asian inspirations. Super creative, super accessible, great for sharing.

Drink: the Ceasar! The assortment of pickled vegetables was amazing!

Share: the Sugo, meaty pasta sauce (enough for like 6 people) and a bag of bread to sop it up with. He explained, mopping up the sauce with bread was always his favourite part of pasta anyways!.

All the other plates are small, so just get an assortment!

I heard the weekend brunch is also excellent!"}
{"text":"Lisa Marie is the newly opened Queen West Restaurant from fidel gastro (@fidelgastros) Matt Basile. The kitchen here will be doing double duty as the production central for his food truck Priscilla as well. Being a big fan of all his pop-up, I just had to go try as soon as they open up.

 I made a reservation for the 2nd day of their opening.
Continuing with their Elvis theme, the space was rather spacious with a bunch of high communal tables on one side. It was in no way a tight space but with the high backless bar stool, I wished there was some kind of hook underneath the table or by the wall to hook my bag or coat.

 At the back, there's many marinated raw meat and canned good to bring home.
I bought their last Jar of Bacon Jam ($7) which I just tried and love, it wasn't oily like many other brands and was packed with bacon. I will have to go back to try the marinated meat as well, a brown butter Guinness marinated chicken sort of catch my eyes 

Love how they are serving all local Beer & Wines

Their menu consist of 11 items, thing meant to share while the menu displayed the special for the bigger plates and desserts.

Testa Dura $11 (Tromba, Aperol, agave water & lime juice) & Wellington Dark $7
Love the simple cocktail, not too sweet and no overwhelming flavors.... perfect.

Since the dishes are all small tapas style, 3 dishes came on the same plate here.
 
Deep Fried Pizza $7
~ Fried pizza dough, saucy homemade meatball w/ lemon arugula & tomato braised white beans
~ I find the fried dough bland and rather tough... I find myself missing Matt's sandwiches and wish the meatball was served on bread instead.

Mozzarella and Marrow Sangweech $7
~ Buffalo mozzarella, roasted veal bone marrow on two slices of focaccia bread deep fried and topped w/ lemon
~ Love this, it's deep fried and it's cheese; what not to love 

Eggplant in a Jar $5
~ Brined eggplant, tallegio cheese, thai chillis and fresh lime served w/ zucchini chips
~ The chips were soggy and tough while the dish itself was very salty, wish it came with some kind of carb (bread/rice?!)

 Pork Belly Cheese Thang $5
~ Smoked pork belly w/ cilantro cherry tomato salsa served on a melted Havarti cheese crisp, topped w/ chili basil aioli
~ The pork belly tasted just like the one in one of his sandwich but without the bread, the pork take center stage.

 Short Rib Polenta Patty $5
~ Beer braised short rib served on a smoked tomato & Parmesan charred polenta cake, topped w/ a fried basil leaf
~ Love this, the polenta cake was soft and slightly sweet which goes perfectly w/ the flavored packed short ribs.

The Turkey Wing 1 for $7 & 2 for $12
~ One massive free-range turkey wing done proper w/ a hoisin chili sauce, sesame seeds and green onion or buffalo style w/ blue cheese aioli & shaved pickled carrot and celery
~ This was more of a drumstick than wing but it was delicious nonetheless. 
~ Surprisingly we both like the hoisin sauce better which was so thick that it cling to the skin so perfectly and with the barely there spiciness was so good.... while the buffalo version was somehow lacking.

Deli Style Surf n' Turf $6
~ House smoked pastrami and cured sardine, served on a latke w/ pickled veg & sour cream
~ Love the colorful presentation, however I find the pickled veggies overwhelm the cured sardine where you can barely taste it when eaten together. The sardine on it's own was perfect, not too salty or sour and still perfectly moist and plump.

 Fresh Tuna Puttanesca Roll $9
~ Ahi tuna marinated in puttanesca sauce rolled w/ bean sprouts, red pepper, purple cabbage, carrot, basil & cilantro in a rice paper wrap. Swerved w/ sweet & sour mango sauce.
~ This was rather spicy and I liked it better with the mango sauce than the fish sauce since it ends up being way too salty while the mango sauce balance the spiciness better. 

 Have dessert plans afterwards, so we didn't order any but would love to try the bone marrow donuts.

 Verdict :
~ Some hits & misses but they just opened so I am hoping some things will change.
~ Wish some of his sandwich was available to order
~ Will definitely come back (^_^)"}
{"text":"I wound up here by accident but glad I did.  The creativity of a food is brilliant.  

Built on the success of Pad Thai fries sold from a food truck, the fries remain and are joined by a bevy of other odd but delicious options.  I'm not sure I'd want to make a dinner out of it, but as an accompaniment to a few drinks it works well.  The most notable of the small tapas was the incredible French Toast with custard in a jar.  It was out of this world good.  Too good.  

Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Our server- Lauren, was amazing! The good was fantastic- the beef short rib and the cauliflower were outstanding. Who knew cauliflower could be so tasty?"}
{"text":"Although the food looks good, looks can be deceiving. As someone who loves food I was highly disappointed with everything I experienced at Lisa Marie. We were there for a friends birthday and it took about 1.5 hrs from when we were seated until we got our food. My eggs were extremely cold, and as were my pad thai fries... you don't want to try those cold. I also found them much spicer than expected as did others at the table. They had also run out of the things some wanted. And the server wasn't very nice. The saving grace was a nice bartender that saw what was going on and brought hot fries out to our table. That said, at 2 hrs in, it was a little late to save the experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening after a few of our other choices fell through. Our group wasn't really looking for a slightly-upscale, slightly-quirky tapas place, and probably would have been much more happy with a plate of nachos from one of the div-ier establishments in the neighborhood, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything that we ordered - the ceviche nachos, pad thai fries, alabama tailgaters and Elvis-in-a-Jar. TBH, the fries might have been my least fav of the four things we ordered, and that's what they are most known for! 

We had no idea the place was an established bunch spot, but after seeing the menu and watching the YGEH, I CANNOT wait to come back. And this coming from someone who really isn't into the whole brunch scene."}
{"text":"First time here last Friday for late drinks and food. We had a reservation for 8, our table wasn't ready (lingering group of people who just wouldn't leave...) but the staff handled it really well. They made a make shift seating area for our group and comped us some drinks while we muched on the pad thai fries. Various wait staff (and manager?) apologized for the delay and our server kept checking in with us. Eventually the group that had overstayed their welcome left and we got our table. I really have to thank the staff for treating us so nicely. Most places would just say \"tough luck, it's a Friday\". Food was on the spicy side, but there are a few less spicy options."}
{"text":"Went there a while back but from what I remember, the food was absolutely delicious.  The drinks were alright, but again, the food!  Both atmosphere and service were great.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is Lazy and underwhelming. Caesars are pretty great, and so is the house hot sauce."}
{"text":"Food ***
Service ***
Ambiance ***1/2
(Out of 5)

Lisa Marie continues to be a reasonably priced bar/restaurant.  I've been here maybe 5-8 times.  It's a place with louder music and ideal for small/medium sized groups friends (3-8)

Wait staff while not super experienced are approachable and nice.  

Drinks and cocktails here are always great.

We had a flank steak the most recent time we went and it was really well prepared.  It was cooked to medium rare and well seasoned.  I'd give that steak 4/5*

Everyone raves about the pad Thai fries but to be honest, they taste nothing like pad thai.   I'd probably get them again if I went there but they aren't amazing."}
