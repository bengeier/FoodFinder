{"text":"Paid 50$ for a filling meal for two people (Burrito, Chimichanga, Cactus hearts, beer, shot). Decent good mexican food, good free salsa as premeal snack. Too bad they don't have a `submarino\" drink on the menu, but ordering a Corona + Shot did the trick, though kinda expensive (about 11$ total).

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunday, L`avenue du plateau had a hugge line. 
the southwest omelette was ok, so was the classico benedict was fine. 

The waiter was hurried, rushing everywhere, but forgetful and sloppy. I had no napkin`s for my entire meal and had to share my bfs. 

nothing memorable, would not return. 

i liked the decor though."}
{"text":"This was a decent place for sunday brunch.  We went as a group of 6 in the early afternoon and there weren't that many people there.  We had some standard mexican dishes... There were chicken burritos, enchiladas, tacos and nachos etc.  The enchiladas was really good, the burrito was similar, but overall, the two tasted pretty much the same.  The tacos are not as good, they tasted mostly like taco shell and spicy tomato sauce.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is not bad, very colourful and there was spanish pop playing in the background.  I found the wall decor to be a bit much though...

Overall, its a decent place, nothing too bad to say about it.  Would recommend it."}
