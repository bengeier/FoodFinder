{"text":"The food was ok. The beef and broccoli was salty. The wonton soup was ok. The egg rolls were ok. The waitress took a long time for our check a d there was like no one in there. The food was just ok. The food was pretty salty but I got the family dinner with my family. Sometimes I would go back but not often or everyday."}
{"text":"What a waste of time order was wrong uber eats was a waste of time once the order is wrong know one wants to help you don't waste your time with this place hated it and can't even get my order right what a joke"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are awesome value, quick service, great food"}
{"text":"Just ordered food and after tasting a little bit of each item I threw it all away. Breading was soggy and undercooked. The veggie rice was bland. I figured I could end this non meal with a good fortune but it's the first time ever I was never given fortune cookies. Never again will I eat here. Inferior food and ingredients for spending $30.00 Blech!!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I stumble upon great Chinese food.  I was fortunate enough to do so while visiting the in laws in Las Vegas.  Everything was great from the General Tsao to the Curry chicken.  None of this MSG tasting, B.S, you'll find elsewhere.  This is the real deal.  Usually I leave my in laws house with a terrible taste in my mouth.  This time I will remember the mouth watering taste of authentic Chinese food that is good enough to sweeten up a mother in laws kiss. Thank you for that experience."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry, and had about 10 minutes get some food for the road. The chef who owned the place totally got this and prepared us an excellent JB Roll. Crispy form the outside, soft inside, and mix with the sweet sauce, all well cut, all in a very short period of time. He was great! Definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"After several years of driving by New China and thinking to myself, \"I should go try that place out,\" I finally made the leap and got some take-out.

I'm wishing I would have just kept driving by like every other day.

The girls working at the counter were very sweet and answered my questions, the food came out at lightening speed.  I got home excited with the notion that I may have finally discovered the long awaited Chinese take-out that I've been missing.  But as Bono sang... \"I still haven't found what I'm looking for.\"

The Vegetable Chow Mein had old stale noodles and an off-taste.  We didn't finish it and that's a rarity.  The Buddha's Delight was just as bad.  Too much zucchini and all the vegetables were soggy, not fresh, and drowning in a greasy, buttery tasting sauce.

This place has received good reviews from other Yelpers, so maybe if you are ordering meat based dishes it is better.  Or maybe I caught them on a really off day.  Whatever the deal is, what we ordered was not good."}
{"text":"This place was my favorite around. I have been here a few times service has always been friendly and fast. Food always fresh. My latest experience here was not the best,we went on a Monday and it was pretty empty but not uncommon for a Monday night at any restaurant. They helped us with friendly smiles and fast service but he food was not so good it didn't seem fresh it seemed as if it had been sitting out all day, I advises them and they nicely made me a fresher plate but it just wasn't the same I didn't want or expect anything free so I still paid in full but it's sad that I won't be returning. It made the whole family sick  upon exiting my mom couldn't help but throw up outside that's just how sick it made her. I hope they get it back together and not make anyone else sick at it was good food before this experience."}
{"text":"Been here since they first opened.  I love everything that they do and the family is excellent.  They could use a small makeover but, in terms of food quality, they're amazing"}
{"text":"I've been this Chinese restaurant about half year, their food is excellent and delicious, especially their fried rice. Recently, they added sushi, I ordered their sushi last week the sushi was really fresh and delicious as well as at an reasonable price. I definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple times 'cause my friend lives nearby, very nice and cozy little restaurant with good prices for the quality of foods served ......big portion sizes, the dishes are tasty and not too salty, the ingredients are fresh ...... highly recommended... They offer takeout options too and they are pretty fast, I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes tops...."}
{"text":"I ordered from New China Cuisine last week hadn't ordered in a while but they now have a sushi menu, I had my food delivered and the quality of the sushi was pretty amazing for it being inexpensive, it was super fresh also ordered a couple of teriyaki bowls. Portion was good and were pretty tasty as well. Delivery time was about an hour but all in all everything was great."}
{"text":"Cute place for cheap chinese food. Nothing special, just a good hole in the wall neighborhood spot. The soup is really good and thick. The fried rice and sweet & sour pork were yummy."}
{"text":"Always.....Very good food..
Everytime I go to chinatown, I walk out dissapointed...here I walk out very happy..family run..great food."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service sucked. Strawberry chicken and pad Thai were really good. Really bad service without a smile and took forever to have them check up on us. There were only 6 people in the whole place.
Maybe I'll just order for pickup next time"}
{"text":"I stopped going to this place for several years due to poor food quality.  Now 3 years later I decided to try it again.  Well, it was a mistake,  now it's the customer service that was terrible.  
I placed my order and it came to the table incorrect.  I let the server know and the place was taken back to the kitchen and the manager REFUSED to correct their mistake!   Now if you are an owner of an establishment and rely on people to come in and pay money to keep you in business, then you need to think twice on how you treat your clientele.
So in a nutshell, I will not be going back to this establishment as there are so many others to choose from in town."}
{"text":"It's hard to review this place.  The food is ok and its hit or miss.  It sometimes can be pretty yuck. It's close and fast.  The customer service is what is awful.  The staff doesn't know anything.  You order something and they always come back and tell you that it will be different then menu. Or different then the picture.  Then why have a picture if it's not what you are getting. There is never anyone in there when we go. No refills on drinks ever."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I was expecting better . I got the food delivered using grub hub the delivery was on time but the food was not good . I ordered the BBQ spare ribs and the ribs barely had any sauce on them and only on one side . Not good , I also ordered the curry chicken  it was watered down the chicken was so soft it didn't even feel like chicken and I ordered it \" spicy \" not spicy AT ALL . The fried rice was completely over fried to the point where the peas in it were completely dried out and the rice looked burnt . The only good thing was the \" crab \" ragoons but only 1 of them had crab in it they should be referred to as cream cheese ragoons . The taste was decent for not having crab in it ( covered them in sweet and sour sauce ) not happy about my experience and ending up throwing away the curry , rice and 2 of the spare ribs . Waste of $23 :( wish I never ordered"}
{"text":"Left my wallet at lunch today here. Went back to get it and they had taken a $20 out of it. Def won't be going back. Good food, bad service and don't leave your wallet"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, a few months  ago. Tonight I was really dissapointed. I ordered take out, family dinner B. Normally I love everything about the family dinner, especially the house fried rice. Tonight I had to throw the whole thing away. The biggest issue was the overall taste of chemicals. I was confused but realized the container had melted. What kind of take out container can't withstand heat? These takeout containers! My crab Rangoon, spring roll, and fried shrimp container had holes where the heat burned trough. Wow. Definitely not a good corner to cut. Also, the rice usually has a plethora of meats and veggies... Again highly dissapointed with my one piece of chicken, few shrimps, and mostly beef. I don't think was any veggies aside from the onions : ( The spring rolls tasted different, the Kung pao had precisely 8 peanuts on top, and the strawberry chicken was ok, would have been better with sauce on the side like the lemon chicken. I'm not sure I will be back. I would like to think maybe it was just an off night, but I'm afraid I'm making excuses because i can't bare to be without a good, close, Chinese place. (I love Thai basil but it's not exactly \"takeout Chinese\") I'm going to bed with a belly full of sadness

{"text":"Super food. As a recent LV transplant, I've eaten at several Chinese places near this restaurant and have been disappointed. They were greasy and not at all what I had become used to in the SF Bay area where there are so many great Chinese restaurants. Then I ordered some take out here and it was great! Much closer to what I remember in SF and the Bay Area. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I walk in, empty. Owner-guy in an Adidas track suit is on the phone and point at the tables (like, go over there!). We sit down. And we wait for 10 minutes to get a drink. Still no menu. Wait another 5 minutes just for menus. Food drops and it's ok. Overall the food was better than the service."}
{"text":"I've ordered pick carry out from here multiple times but today I decided to stay and eat. For some reason the food didn't seem as great. The service was a little lacking and there was a but of disconnect between the waiter and us. I think I might just stick to ordering to go."}
{"text":"Delivery Women was so Kind , Food was hot and it was late 1 hour before closing and our food was just as delicious as any other time .  thank you"}
{"text":"BEST chinese fast food on the North side! Hands down to the cook! SO generous with their large portions of meat. Family combo fed 4 of us with left overs still. Chow mein is full of flavor. Egg drop soup has plenty of ground pork in it. Fried rice is fresh,soft & fluffy. Orange beef had the perfect texture & right amount of sauce. Friendly service & fast delivery. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese Chicken Salad I ever had! It had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad! Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Well the food is ok,  but the service has defiantly went down hill.  The server had very broken English and orders had to be repeated, No big deal. She seemed nice. Then I noticed she was the only one serving all the tables inside, preparing sushi, and charging customers at check out.  While we were eating we Were not asked if everything was okay. We were also not checked to see if we needed anything else or if we needed refills. They just dropped the plate and didn't see anyone again til I had to pay. Also the sushi was terrible! The salmon was was not fresh, I could tell by taste and by color it was a very pale pink .  I'm usually an easygoing person  and can over look many things.   But after this visit I'm completely turned off by this place.   What a shame."}
{"text":"What a shame! Never again!
This place used to be good for a quick cheap lunch.
It may have changed hands because the staff are new and sooooo rude.
The food is now a gooey mess, it super sugar sauces.
Tea pots are gone, you get a mug with a tea bag floating, you have to beg for a saucer and spoon to remove the bag.
The sauce on my usual food had changed and when I asked for the usual, I was told I had to pay for the first bad order and then get a replacement.
When I said I didn't want it, he said I could get it to go!!
Incidentally, the place is empty..I wonder why!"}
{"text":"This place just isn't the same. I've been eating here for a while and keep noticing the decline with each visit. When I walked in it took forever to get seated and the smell was really bad inside. It smelled like rotten eggs so they might have some pipes that need a checking. I did have 6 people at my table but there were no other customers so waiting just over a hour for our food was beyond ridiculous! The egg drop soup was a gloppy mess and my beef dish was tough with a terrible flavor. I have ordered this dish many times and just isn't what it once was. hen the bill came our server assumed we needed split checks after I specifically told her that I was paying for our party and she made it very confusing and awkward for the myself and the others at my table. I questioned coming back since the experience here wasn't what it once was ans then I saw a ROACH running across the floor and knew I'd never be back again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for mini mini years and tonight it was a very very disappointed on organized didn't have everything they needed they ran out of things I was just very unhappy"}
{"text":"Overall food was good.. The Chow mein was not that good compared to what I had from other places. The Mongolian Beef was good- probably my fave so far, Chicken Teriyaki was kind of sweet for my taste and the Happy family house special was also good it had chicken, beef & seafood. We ordered through the yelp app and did not have any problems."}
{"text":"Great food and a nice place but the service is really slow, so if your not in a rush it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"What a disappointment... Horrible customer service and food was hardly edible. Make sure you check your order because mine was all wrong, although the ice tea"}
{"text":"Holy cow two hours to get our food delivered and we are less than two miles from the restaurant!!! Is someone kidding me? Called and they kept saying it's on the way multiple times!! Lies lies lies!"}
{"text":"Try the salt n pepper pork chops and thank me  after you go back for seconds.  My pleasure."}
{"text":"Good service, fast and friendly take out. Food was made quickly and even after stopping for coffee was still hot when we got it home.

Only negative is the meat seems to be of low quality and I would have preferred Panda Express over the meat here. My husband loves this place though."}
{"text":"This your typical dining Chinese restaurant. Nothing real special. The food was good. Refills kept coming. Was clean but we were the only ones dining there and it was mid day. Wide variety on the menu. 

I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"My family are faithful customers to this business. They are generous with their portion sizes and are extremely prompt with their delivery.

My brothers always go for the usual Mongolian Chicken or Pork Fried Rice but my favorites are the house special beef and the Dragon and Phoenix."}
{"text":"What I thought was a bad experience they at
Least tried by still delivering our food while I was sad and cancelled Thanks guys ;) that's good customer service and the food was amazing hands down best in town"}
{"text":"Love their egg rolls which are big and tasty. Very quick service and their staff is very friendly. Food is pretty solid as well with a nice selection. I would definitely recommend to anyone out there."}
{"text":"Ewww. Wor Wonton Soup was \"ok\" but why was everything in it battered? Egg Rolls - Good flavor but greasy. Chicken Garlic Chili was... fine... Not good... Not Horrific... Not much taste other than soy and chilis. Egg foo young was unidentifiable as such!!  Deep fried breaded something (cabbage?) patties (not the lovely little fried omelets full of bean sprouts and meat that it should be) with a disgusting, thick slimey brown something (not soft silky gravy... slimey) full of battered (again with the batter) meat.  I usually give second chances just to see if maybe I caught an off-night... New China wont get that allowance. Had I dined in I would have sent it all back to the kitchen and walked out. Ew!"}
{"text":"This place is a small mom and pop restaurant, but the menu is HUGE! Many great selections, and the service is great! We got our food really quick as well! This is by far one of the best Chinese restaurants in the North Las Vegas area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to only one Chinese food place most of my life and this reminded me of the place back at home. 

I don't always eat Chinese food because for one person you can end up spending a lot but this place is great! They have nice combo meals that make it weary and their food comes out fresh and hot. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with family and they love this place. 

Maybe because I live in an area of Orange County where I get to have authentic Asian foods regularly, I'm jaded.

Prices and service: great and good.

Food: Just ok.

Not that I didn't enjoy the food, it just wasn't so spectacular that I want to hit this place up every visit to Las Vegas. It surely beats fast food and it's close to family and inexpensive so it's on a list of places I'll consider but not crave. 

I appreciated how the Chow Mein wasn't overloaded with veggies. Not that I don't like veggies, I just sometimes feel that places should just name it a veggie mein with some noodles."}
{"text":"Regularly order delivery via Uber Eats. Go to dishes are the PuPu Platter: everything is great but don't care for the BBQ ribs which are tough and little meat. Sweet and sour chicken which comes w sauce on the side so it's not soggy. Fried rice, either chicken or house, bot are good. other dishes tried are Chow Fun shrimp, which was ok, Taos shrimp."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what make me keep coming back, but I just really dig the place. The staff is friendly, food is made quickly, and it tastes good- guess that does it! I guess you could say I'm a chile-head, and they do a good job making my dishes extra spicy when I ask."}
{"text":"This was awful, my friend recommended this place to me because of the orange chicken. I ordered some today and it was just undercooked and had an awful flavor to is. The outside was not crunchy at all it was just soggy. Worst $10.00 I ever spent. Please don't come to this restaurant I'm just hoping I don't get sick for eating undercooked chicken. Save your money and your time. The service was ok, they weren't very helpful."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a few years now. Their wonton soup is the BEST in the city. The staff is always very very polite, though pretty reserved (as is typical of many Asian cultures) do I'm not really sure where these other jerks get off saying the service was terrible.. Maybe you're just an asshole? I LOVE this restaurant and will continue to eat here because it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"As neighborhood Chinese restaurants go this one is pretty good. I have only ever ordered take out so I can't speak for the table service. The delivery service however, is pretty fast and nice. Having a terrible craving for Chinese food yesterday I ordered beef with snow peas, fried wonton, and honey chicken - all for myself.  The bf likes the bbq pork fried rice so that was his request even though he was not hungry for dinner.

I like their fried wonton. I have had both the cream cheese and the pork. I think I may enjoy the pork more but I will have to sample it again when I am not starving. You know how being hungry makes everything taste good. Was a little perturbed that it didn't come with sweet and sour sauce like the cream cheese ones. Instead, it came with this oily chili looking something in a small container that went straight into the trash. Luckily I had left over sweet and sour sauce from the last time I had made lumpia.  

The beef and snow peas is solid. Being the carnivore that I am, I would like there to be less veggies and more beef. There also happens to be carrots and a whole plethora of other things as well as the snow peas but that really doesn't matter to me. Give me more of the wafer thin wonderfully covered in brown sauce and melt in you mouth beef. The honey chicken is not bad. It's very \"Americanized.\" White meat, covered in batter and then again in sauce. Well not everything can be a home run but  at least it gets to the base.

Now as I've mentioned in other reviews the rice at an Asian restaurant can make or break it for me. Their rice is \"iffy.\" And by that I mean, when I get it, at first it is piping hot and has a passable sticky texture. However, on the reheat for leftovers it's a no go. It's mealy, dry and has \"instant rice\" texture. Well, leftovers can get homemade rice since there is always some available. As for the fried rice, my bf really likes it. Beyond that, I don't know cause I don't eat fried rice."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family and I have been eating here for years. We always have the food delivered and the service 
is always quick. The portions are s great value for the price. The hunan beef and eggrolls are my favorite. One of these days we'll have to eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD! This was my first time ordering from here and will be my last. I spent $70 just to literally throw it away, not one person liked it."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food s good and the staff is friendly. Eat in, take out, or delivery, no problems. I think it's family owned because depending on whose cooking the flavors change a little. My favorite are the Singapore noodles and the shrimp fried rice. I always pick up some extra soup for lunch the next day. Good prices with a quality product."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats, which I must say the driver went above and beyond bringing the worst Chinese food ever.  Rice over cooked and mushy and so was the chicken in the black bean sauce I ordered.  The spareribs were old and had been sitting around awhile. Horrible. I didn't even try the house fried rice that came with it.  It went in the garbage with everything else."}
{"text":"I'm always ordering to go from this restaurant since I moved in here in North Las Vegas. Their Kung Pao Chicken is my favorite, and their sushis as well. Everything on their menu is a must try!"}
{"text":"I am sorry I didn't read the reviews before I ordered,  I ordered a meal to go and read the reviews while I waited.  I have been going here for a long time, but something changed and I want be going back.  I had to wait at least a half hour for my food.  It was not good at all.  The chicken was tasteless and it was not fresh.  The sauce which should have been spicy was bland and not spicy.  The rice tasted like it had been sitting for a while.  The food has really changed, too bad."}
{"text":"Was wanting some sweet and sour pork really badly.  Came here and ended up getting the strawberry chicken as well.  Both excellent.   Clean place and very attentive staff.  Large portion sizes, way more than enough for 2 people.  Easy to dine in or take out."}
{"text":"My family started going to this restaurant from its opening and have been regular customers ever since. Tonight was the worst and unfortunately, we probably won't be returning. The food is usually better than ok, but tonight it was practically inedible.  When we arrived we were told to just pick a table. The soup was so salty I nearly threw it up. After one spoon, I could not eat anymore. The Happy Family brown sauce was also extremely salty. The \"crab\" meat used in the dish was fake,salty and rubbery. All of the vegetables in the dish had completely absorbed the brown sauce, rendering them inedible as well.  The service was spotty at best, but they were very polite. Although there were not many people in the serving area, the servers were busy with everything else. We had to ask for spoons, knives, and water. We had to ask for clean tea cups, because they were sticky and had dried food in them. Then I saw our server washing dishes in the back. Another server rolled the clean dishes out using a trashcan as a trolley.  Needless to say, I felt disgusted and a little sick upon seeing that.  The decor has seen better days and has not been updated since opening day. It feels a bit drab, but it could be forgiven if the food was still up to par. But, sadly the quality of the food has gone the way of the decor- dull, boring, tasteless and not worth another visit. I really hope they improve soon. I'd hate to see them close."}
{"text":"My go to place for Chinese food. Food is always good and fresh. They are quick about preparing your food and the quality is always amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I were super excited to finally, after a long day, set down and enjoy a great meal. To my surprise, while eating chicken chop suey, I see a huge dead bug in my food!!! We immediately informed the waitress.  Although she did apologize and didn't charge us for the meal, she didn't offer any other type of compensation for a freaking floating bug within the juices of my entree, other than an apologize. \"I'm sorry sometimes they fly in the food\" wtf. I will never go to this damn place again!!! Not recommended whatsoever. As they are fully aware that there just might be a bug in your food!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good just a tad bit slow in service. But because the food is so apatitizing, they deserve 10 stars. Most locals if you live in the New north Las Vegas area, this is your date night at home take out. Tonight I am doing a surprise date night so this should be great...  Order now. Tell them Glowing Star Media sent you!"}
{"text":"We've been here few times with me and my husband we always order to go .last time we went they forgot to put sauce for the sweet n sour chicken and over cook it my husband so mad when we got home we haven't order from them ever since"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery this evening. Placed the order and it arrived 30 minutes before the quoted delivery time. Food was really good. Portion sizes are big. I ordered the General TSO's, and easily could have split it. Definitely will order from this place again. 

My only negative critique was the side of fried rice being $6."}
{"text":"So this place is located in a great area. I already go to the dry cleaners  and the brow place that is next store to it. The place was empty which is not a good sign but I said what the hell. I got the Singapore Noodles, it has pork, shirmp, yellow curry and glass noodles. Not too spicy and very good."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS HORRIBLE! why didn't i listen to the reviews on Yelp? Im stubborn and wanted to give this place a try. All of their food tastes just like their strawberry chicken. was it really all strawberry chickens made to look like beef, pork.. wonton.. etc? maybe they mass produced this -said, strawberry chicken and masked it to look like other items on the menu. whatever. shitty food. good luck."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Friday, the place was empty. It should of been a sign... The food was ok, tasted as if was reheated and served. The noodles were really soggy and the rice was very dry. Didn't think to much of it until I got home, reheated the food and saw a cockroach mixed in with the noddles. Needless to say I will never, ever go back back to that awful place."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill."}
{"text":"TLDR: it's never a good idea to order sushi from a Chinese place. Stick to what it knows. The check in special does not apply for sushi either.

The interior is pretty nice. Spacious with high ceilings and fairly clean. Reminds me of China A Gogo.

They have a pretty good selection of food at a decent price. We got the beef chow fun and the sushi combo of 3 rolls. 

The sushi was mediocre but I should've known better. What I thought was a pretty good deal, turned to be an expensive one. They also didn't give us any soy sauce tray. The beef chow fun was good. Oily as expected but savory. Oh, the sushi combo does come with seaweed salad but it was kinda cold.

I don't plan on coming back. It was alright."}
{"text":"This place is good the food was delivered before time given and was hot. Taste was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Chinese food place. The food is excellent and service was great too. I had the combination fried rice, chow mein and teriyaki chicken. I will definitely come back. Keep in mind that they are preparing your food fresh, so it may take a little longer. I suggest you call ahead."}
{"text":"I personally love coming to this place. The staff is extremely nice and easy going and the food is very good!

I also like that you can place an order online.
VERY convenient when im craving Chinese on the way home from work. 

Beef & Broccoli, Chicken with hot garlic sauce and their wonton soup is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Waited over 90 minutes for delivery. Called restaurant and they kept saying it was 5 min away."}
{"text":"Only Chinese place we go to. Have been going here for over 10 years. Btw the pad thai is awesome"}
{"text":"It's take out......  They aren't the most friendliest true but I come back every time. I order for pick up and will continue."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! You just
Lost a good customer. First when I went in the worker slammed the door basically in my face then I get home and there's no fried rice. I paid extra for it and got 2 steamed rice. When I called the woman barely spoke English and told me they were closing I can't have my money back. I told her we would bring all the food back for a full refund she kept trying to tell me they were closed. Never again. I use to go here every couple days but not anymore"}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese food, this place NAILS it. Clean setting when you walk in, however I've only ordered carry-out so I can't speak for the dine-in service. 

The food however, is fantastic. Mongolian beef is just top notch. If you get it on a lunch special, you just can't beat that price. Eggdrop soup is perfect with bits of chicken within (unlike other places) and the app of cream cheese wontons was fantastic. 

This is the new go to spot for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Impressed. Got delivery. The sushi was awesome. Really fresh and delicious. The sweet and sour shrimp was best I have had. Crab rangoon- perfect. Will be back 100%"}
{"text":"I ended up having dinner with my mom. The place is kinda of a local spot if your in the mood for Chinese food, and you don't feel like driving out to china town. I order beef and broccoli, which previous review said it was salty. I felt that the dish didn't really have any flavor to it, plus it wasn't good. We order chicken chow mien, which I really enjoyed and shared a bowel of egg drop soup, which was really good. 
Be careful with your drink! we had a ice tea and the server / lady had pick up another person cup at the same time to take to the back. She ended up coming back and gave us another cup which the lemon wasn't squeeze. I felt that she was in the rush, and didn't feel we got the right drink / cup back. Lol... I'm kinda use to getting tea right off the back as courtesy. They do charge for that."}
{"text":"Time: 13:30 pm 
What: Lunch Special 
  Drop Egg Soup
  Egg Role 
  Chicken & Shrimp with Cashews 
  Pork Fried Rice 
  Price: 6.99
How did it taste: 
  I didn't like my drop egg soup. It didn't taste so bad, but it looked awful! It looked like raw egg whites and after I looked at it I couldn't eat it... not good! 
The egg role was very good and so was the rest of my food. I probably would go back since it wasn't very far from where we live. 
Service was ok but not perfect. 4 stars because I had a good time!"}
{"text":"I really like this place because it seems like a good value for the quality and quantity of food you recieve.  You can dine-in, take out, or get delivery if you happen to live in the area.  Food orders are usually done within 10-15 minutes.  They have a combo menu that includes your choice of entrees, an egg roll, crab rangoon, a decent size bowl of egg flower or hot and sour soup, and BBQ pork fried rice.  All under 10 bucks.

Every times I've called in an order they have always been polite and the service in the dining room was great.  Granted the place is in a mini-mall, but I can't blame them.  Seems like everything in Vegas is either in a casino or mini-mall.  It's a small place, but well decorated and they proudly display an A from the health department."}
{"text":"Place is great! Everything was fresh. Whole restaurant was clean. Drinks were never empty. Soups was hot and fresh. We are very glad that we discovered this place. Honestly we were starting to get a little tired of the same old tired Chinese places we were going to before. Will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"This is a good NLV spot! Friendly staff and dinner was on point. I'll be going here again for sure!"}
{"text":"The fried rice is so good! Strongly recommend! The sushi is fresh and have good flavor. Trying to explore more food on the menu. But for now, I will add this restaurant as one of my daily going restaurants just for its fried rice XD."}
{"text":"I like their Mongolian Beef & Dry Beef Chow Fun. Really good :)"}
{"text":"Please add beverages to your online like sodas and Thai tea cold drinks."}
{"text":"Very good for a regular Chinese restaurant. I would like to make the. Moment on service though. The personnel seems to be very busy with a lot of other things forgetting the guests at times. 
It also looks like the budget for interior ran out halfway. The ceiling fixtures look great so do the walls but the seating and lower areas were very low budget :)"}
{"text":"Love love love the house special beef.  I try to frequent this restuarant weekly.  It is my preferred Chinese place to eat.  The waitress is so darn sweet.  The food comes really fast.  I can never seem to get enough of the House Special Beef.  It rocks!  It is on the pricer side of the menu however after the first taste, I was hooked. And there always seems to be plenty of leftovers for the next day as the portion sizes are great.  The only bad thing is the initial serving of rice is small.  But they do bring more upon request.  The potsticker are on the small side but the sauce that comes with it...delish!"}
{"text":"Delivery took about an hour and a half. Food was decent. Same as all the other Chinese places around Las Vegas. Nothing to brag about really. It was good for the price."}
{"text":"The sushi was very good and lots of choices. Husband had Chinese shrimp and snow pea. Rather bland and sauce less than flavorful. The waitresses where attentive and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I would recommend especially for the sushi."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice and both times haven't been bad. They weren't amazing,  either, but the delivery was fast and they were really friendly.

The chicken fried rice here was a little on the bland side, sadly. And the pork fried wontons are a no-go for us -- they're VERY greasy...very very and the meat inside has this funky taste to it. Almost tangy? Maybe too much soy or something.

The lo-mein was good, but oilier than I'm accustomed to (are you sensing a theme?)

The sweet n' sour chicken is decent -- white meat and your standard sweet n' sour sauce. They do have the good sense to put it on the side so your chicken doesn't arrive in flaccid hot pink blobs.

Now that I've tried Jasmine Express, I probably won't order from here again, as their same menu items were a bit better, but they're definitely not bad."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I didn't dine in. I ordered over the phone when I got there it was ready to go. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went In for lunch on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, prices were pretty affordable. Food was good. Only complaint is that the host/waitress didn't seem to have experience. Took her forever to bring drinks/food. Seems like the older lady had to tell her what to do every time. Hopefully she will get better because I can see myself eating there a couple times a month"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but I had to ask 2 times for a refill on my drink. I'm the only one here eating. 
The food was absolutely the best i have had. The service. .... Well an empty drink is bad."}
{"text":"This place is so Good!! I always get chicken friend rice and wontonsoup!! Always so great , fast delivery!!"}
{"text":"My family order form this historical local Chinese restaurant almost every week. Their fried rice is amazing. I like to order their sweet and sour chicken for take out, they put the sauce on the side and it taste like a unique flavor of chicken fingers. Their Orange Chicken is always great. Plus they use chicken white meat for all chicken dishes. I used to work for supermarkets and I know the cost difference of white meat and dark meat. They could make much more profit if they use dark meats but they still kept it that way. Great restaurant for local!"}
{"text":"I came across this place on yelp. I ordered the lunch special, orange chicken and pork fried rice. Side of egg rolls as well. I wasn't all too excited about the fried rice, a bit hard to bite into. Server's were friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had takeout from NCC probably 6 or 7 times in the year that we have lived in NLV. This is easily the best Chinese food we have found in NLV and we have tried multiple places. The potstickers are excellent as are almost all the dishes we have tried. Orange and Strawberry Chicken are both really good. If you are ordering takeout, highly recommend doing the Family Meals on the menu since it will save you quite a bit of money over ordering ala carte, although your selection will be a bit more limited."}
{"text":"i have loved this Chinese restaurant for the past ten years these guys know how to make hot and sour soup and the strawberry chicken is not only one of a kind but delicious."}
{"text":"Just ordered from new china cuisine and the food came fast and was fantastic! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very hot in here, felt like the AC wasn't working.

They won't let you substitute for noodles instead of rice. Chow main is a separate $6.75 charge.

Very slow service, despite being almost empty."}
{"text":"Went for a quick pickup order.great food, good value.  Only took 5 minutes if that. Will go back again."}
{"text":"We only came because my parents asked us to meet them here. 
With that said, it was one of the worst food & experiences.  The gal hardly understood what we were asking her. We had to get our own soy sauce trays & when we asked, they only gave us 2 for a family of 4. 
Asked for 2 more & got the small tray that holds the Wasabi. 
Barely any fish on the rolls & we were the only family there on a Sat when we ordered & they took soooo long for each roll. 

Needless to say, we won't be coming back. 
Cheap sushi for cheap experience."}
{"text":"My wife wants to have some Chinese food, and our neighbours suggested this place. They also sale sushi there. Tried some Salmon and Tuna nigiri, very fresh. My wife love their Chow Mein. The server told us their best sell is fried rice, gonna that next time. We also got a Teriyaki Bowl  to go for my father."}
{"text":"Easily a 4.  The food was great.  The atmosphere is pretty nice actually (very clean, nice lighting, quiet, newer looking interior) and the price was awesome and well worth the money.

Got fried noodles, a choice of soup, full size entree (I had to take some home it was so generous) and a large eggroll and a ragoon with pork fried rice.  $8.25.  Seriously.

The staff was nice and attentive, and even put our leftovers away for us.  

5+ all the way.  I will be coming here often.  The food was very memorable and you won't even kill a $10 bill on food coming here (make sure you leave a generous tip though!)"}
{"text":"We used to order here a lot because we loved the food but today's experience was horrible!  Delivery driver is highly rude! We order sweet and sour chicken and brought us pork, I'm sorry but I want what we paid for, my kids don't eat pork at all, so should I let them starve because they brought wrong food? Nope! So I called to let them know that they brought pork and not chicken and I explained to the lady on the phone that the order was wrong so she said Ok she will let the cook know and send the driver so when the driver gets here he straight out tells my husband, don't order from here again! My husband couldn't believe what he said so he told him\"excuse me?\" And the driver replied \"I said don't order from here again, I don't get paid hourly!\" Wow I had to call back and the lady who clearly does not understand or speaks English couldn't respond to what her driver said all she said was \"manager is not here call tomorrow\" I said no I want to talk to the manager now so please have them call me asap. So we patiently waited for the call and yes manager called us back which is a plus but seriously they need to hire qualified drivers who can give customer service better! Thank goodness we didn't give him tip!"}
{"text":"There was an uncomfortable smell when we ate inside the restaurant so we have decided to keep our visits solely to take out only. We usually get the dinner combos which is plenty of food for less than 10 bucks. It comes with your choice of entree, pork fried rice, cup of soup, crab rangoon, and an eggroll. Such an awesome deal and very delicious. My favorites are the strawberry chicken and the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Take out made as requested, no drama. Perfectly timed. Great food Great prices. Lettuce Wraps are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking gross.
save your money, panda express is far better.

Not even exaggerating.  classic kitchen nightmare."}
{"text":"I've frequently visited this place for Chinese food since 2009. This place is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in North Las Vegas! Just tried their Sushi which just came out this year and it was also delicious! It's also cheaper than many other sushi bars as well. I strongly recommend the Alaskan Roll and The American Dream! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends who love sushi!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the new sushi menu. They are not offering AYCE yet, but they do have two sushi dinner options. They also are offering 15% off of sushi right now. I ordered the dinner number 2 which came with a choice of three-four piece rolls and a choice of miso soup garden salad or seaweed salad. I went with the miso which did not taste like the typical miso flavor but a watered down version of it with a little chicken broth flavor. Odd. For the sushi rolls I ordered the Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna and a spicy crab. All which were made/tasted like every other sushi restaurant. I think they have potential but definitely need to work on the flavoring of the food."}
{"text":"Hate to say this, but this was by far the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Ordered the Pork Egg Foo Young lunch special.  I don't exactly know if that constitutes as an omelet. Actually, the whole presentation was off-putting at first, I literally opened our take out box for a second and was not pleased with what I saw. Eating it just furthered my disappointment. The supposed 'omelet' was really mushy. I didn't really taste much egg nor felt anything that resembled an egg. There were also no good flavors to redeem. On top of that, the sauce was way over-salted, pretty much making it a really gross meal. The fried rice was nothing to write home about either. Mostly just bland. My fiance got the pork chow mien. Also a disappointment. It just didn't taste good at. Nothing tasted good except for the egg drop soup that it came with. We're definitely never coming back here. Maybe their lunch specials just suck? Still, the experience was so bad, I don't want to risk trying anything else."}
{"text":"I'm so sad. I've always loved this place. I went for dine in with my family and there was hair in my food. A black curly piece of short hair and my hair is super long so I know it was not mine. The bathrooms were super dirty, like a truck stops. I sadly will no longer be eating here"}
{"text":"This was our first time here! This will be our last time here! We had to send the spare ribs back because they were not hot, actually they were cold.
I ordered Shrimp Cantonese which was tasteless and half of what was on the plate was bamboo.
My wife had the Honey Chicken which she liked."}
{"text":"Their food, really, isn't that bad.

Until you find a dead roach in your duck.

And your order is messed up because apparently of the way the online ordering system relays back to them? We ordered our dishes ala carte and somehow we ended up with...more of a personal order. Like entree and rice in one plate. Got the soups and egg rolls with our meals even though we didn't order it. Probably sounds like a good deal...vut when there are 8 people in the house and the portion is all screwed up? We stay hangry. Why we didn't return? Because that means I would have to drive all the way back and wait all over again. No stacks.

Then another time we had ordered hong Kong pan fried noodles online with the special instructions of \"omit the shrimp due to allergy restrictions\". Upon pick up...our food was not available because they did not understand the special instructions. Grrr...

Sorry to be a hardknock but we have lived in the area for almost 13 years and it definitely has been slipping here that it really is time for us to make another spot our go-to if all else fails. 

And surprise roach in duck...definitely was not what we ordered as well. My husband almost threw up and was extremely disgusted. I'm from Hawaii where we got humongous flying cockroaches so we aren't ignorant to it...but dead in your food? Uh-no stanks. I can't imagine all the other dead roaches I might of accidentally eaten. 

But seriously...the food isn't that bad taste wise. Safe to say years of this place and we are finally hanging our hats up."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by chance when I was in north Las Vegas. I have been told that they just had sushi recently. So I ordered two chef special roll, it was very delicious! The shrimp tempura is definitely a must! It's sooooo crispy!!! It's absolutely the best Chinese restaurant in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would say this is your above average Chinese restaurant.  The food is the same as other Americanized Chinese restaurants.  

It is cozy inside, some booths and a few tables.  They do have beer and wine here.

Good size portions, fair prices, pretty fast service. 

This is your typical review for a typical restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their food I always order their Sweet & Sour chicken,flower egg soup & orange chicken very good food nice ppl too"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Las Vegas by far!!!!! Family dinner B is the way to go!!!! Dine in pick up or take out not a complaint from this family!!!!"}
{"text":"i order from this place at least once a week! i love their bbq pork fried rice and bbq spareribs. the food seems to be 'cooked to order' since it's always hot and fresh when i pick up. we've had a few other items that weren't bad, but i'm a creature of habit and always seem to order the same items. BIG PLUS... their prices are not too expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean dining area, friendly staff, and fair prices - can't ask for much more.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Food took forever. Over 1 hour and tasted awful. Will never order from here again. This isn't authentic Chinese food by any means. It doesn't resemble any of the dishes that we've all come to know. Orange chicken tasted like it came from a can. The shrimp on lobster sauce had no flavor at all not even soy sauce could help it. Shrimp are NOT deveined at all. Poor excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for lunch couple days ago. The place is clean. We ordered lunch special. The food was awesome. We ordered hot and sour soup and chicken in black bean sauce. Both the dishes were yummy. I will definitely go back again. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The Orange Chicken is delicious! I love their Egg Drop Soup as well. Ever since I found out about this place a little over a year ago, It is the only place I go to for Chinese food. Very affordable and even cheaper if you get the lunch specials from 11-4pm."}
