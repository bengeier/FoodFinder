(Short review lol)"}
{"text":"Service is very good, we ordered 4 ppl combo. Food is very fresh, we like the crab, the calm the most."}
{"text":"Good food but pricey
The seafood is fresh,but you have to wait like almost 30mins for them to cooked.
I would rather have seafood at home instead"}
{"text":"The lady serving our table was very polite and went above and beyond , She deshelled our order of shrimp for us even that's not part of her job. The place is clean but with no doubt, the price is way above par. An order of beef skewers with 2 skewers of 4 small cubes per skewer costs$16 might be too expensive for what you get it you ask me. We paid about $60 after tax per person

I was not quite used to putting chicken feet for the congee esp most of my friends don't eat that. Wish they can let customers to substitute with other things.

Also from my experience in China, the congee base itself should come with the dinner but they charge $10-$15 for putting a little bit is rice and 3 pieces of pork.

Overall, I think I will go back again but maybe for a special occasion.  Other than the steaming it seemed like regular hot pot to me.  As far as I'm aware, hotpot isn't supposed to be that expensive ."}
{"text":"Had some expectations from the good reviews here. The grilled and steamed oysters were good, but everything else was mediocre and overpriced. If I'm paying that much per person I expect fresh and quality seafood. The grilled meat skewers looked well BBQed, but when you bit into it it's just warm and the meat was tough. Which means they probably cooked it before hand and heat it up at high - which is fine if I'm not paying almost $100 a person. We also added an order of ribeye for steaming. Since they praise themselves as an Angus beef specialist, I expected great quality beef. But instead we got a small plate of thinly sliced ribeye, and the rim of the meat was turning brown. Which probably meant that the beef was frozen and they had to thaw if when we ordered it. Again, that would've been fine if I was paying $30 per person.
All in all, it's not a place that I'll want to return for a second meal."}
{"text":"Good food and nice decoration. It is a good place for business dinner or friend gathering for conversation"}
{"text":"Great environment.  Steamed seafood with soup or congee at bottom.  It is steam pot.

Set combo can be chosen or a la carte if you like.   Seafood very fresh.  Eat with any sauce tastes exceptional good.

Service is good to explain everything.

Expensive !"}
{"text":"Food: Seafood, meat and vegetables are freshly picked. There is a sauce bar, with many varieties and very clean neat and tidy! Excellent choices and quality!

Environment: Nicely decorated, comfortable seating, and clean.

Service: Superb. Food is by default served, but can be self serve by choice. Dishes were changed frequently to avoid added shells on the plate. Waiters and Waitresses are extremely polite, patient and well- mannered. They made everyone felt cared for by coming around to chit chat with you. 

Overall: Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my family on a Saturday. We got a groupon which included a lobster OR crab, and 1lb mussels OR clam, and the winter melon soup (no other choices). In addition to the groupon, we also ordered some skewers (lamb, chicken wings and chicken tenderous bone), 1 order of angus beef (tenderloin) and 1 order of 5 kinds of vegetables. 

The environment was nice, seafood was fresh and the staff were helpful and friendly, and that is how they earned two stars.

Overall, their food was extremely slow. There were only 4 tables in the restaurant so I wasn't sure why the food was taking so long. We waited around 10-15 minutes in between each dish coming out , and after they bring it out, you need to wait for the server to put it in to steam (you can't do it yourself), and then it's gotta steam for 3-8 minutes depending on what it is , then you gotta wait for them to serve it. One hour into our meal I was still super hungry as I only ate a bit of lobster and a few clams at this point. 

Being an angus beef place, I expected the angus beef tenderloin to be very delicious, but it wasn't. The texture of the beef was very soggy and it was not flavourful at all (just tasted like steamed water - no beef taste). It was also very expensive for what we got ($16/4oz) for beef that was just steamed. Was extremely disappointed by this. 

For the seafood, we got lobsters and clams. The seafood was fresh but the taste was very ordinary - just tasted like regular steamed seafood that I would eat at home. The seafood sauce provided was a nice complement but again, overall , it was not worth the price. 

The skewers were also below average - the sauce for the chicken wings and chicken tenderous bone was way too sweet, and the lamb was too fatty. The vegetables were literally just steamed and you could dip in soy sauce. We got corn, nappa, pumpkin, zucchini and Chinese yam. 

At the very end, they serve the soup in the bottom with some rice , and that is how we got full eventually. This soup / rice tasted really good, but the actual expensive food (seafood / beef) is not what I would come here for. 

Our full meal after tax and tips for 3 people (including groupon) was about $140. Very expensive for what we got; will never come back here."}
{"text":"Nice spacious set-up for a different take on hotpot.  You don't cook your food in a boiling pot of broth but it's all steamed in front of you, which has been trending in Hong Kong.  

Their combos start at $45 per person and goes up to $95 (if paid by cash).  There's also an a-la-carte option but it's not as impressive as getting one of their combos.  

Everything is brought out on a nicely displayed platter that are great for photos.  The staff all wear gloves while handling the raw food and does the food prep for all the tables.  There's a large steamer in the middle of each table with space beneath it if you want to include congee, soup or rice (which takes over an hour to cook).  All of these are cooked with all the flavor and oil seeping into it from the meats/veggies above.  

After the staff places the raw food on the steamer, it is covered by a large glass lid and a timer is set with the recommended cooking times.  You can watch as the clams and mussels open up before you indicating they're ready.  

All the seafood that's brought out is fresh.  I know because I saw the lobsters and shrimps still twitching while it was being cooked.  

The staff were all very helpful as they came by frequently to check and prep the food for us.  At $45+, this is an expensive meal.  Nice to try for special occasions but I don't see myself coming back too often as it's almost double the cost for traditional hotpot (which there are many in that area)."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh seafood, moist and tender iberico pork, and tasty house-made dipping sauce (I suspect it might a combination with fish sauce?), but overall very simplistic cooking method that's very easy and simple to recreate - it's just steamed, after all.

The enjoyment comes from watching the food cook under the glass dome, where all the dishes have been perfectly timed to be just cooked through without being overdone, preserving all the taste and moisture of whichever dish you choose.  The only dish I wouldn't recommend is the beef, which is strange considering that \"Angus beef\" is advertised right on their headline, but when steamed it literally just tastes like boiled beef.  When grilled, it's a bit better, but still tastes like beef that's been boiled then grilled.

Great and attentive table-side service, which is where many of my points here are allotted towards!"}
{"text":"Very Fresh Seafood (but some big clams didn't open up not sure if it's fresh)
Nice atmosphere
Good Service
Interesting cooking technique
Last congee really good
 
Cooking time very marginal, some food not even 100% cooked, ie. fish/lobster, abalone too hard....3 out of 5 ppl got mild tummy pain afterward.
Bbq kebab portion really small
Angus Beef tasteless
Veg (Nappa not ready and tasteless, black fungus too hard and dry, Enoki mushroom not fresh...taste weird, winter melon too hard)
Desserts (dry up hard ball, tasteless) is not up to standard
Long waiting time for waiter to come between each dish, spent 2.5 hours for a simple steam set dinner
Way too expensive"}
{"text":"Fresh Food | Great taste | Great Service | Beautiful Environment | Good Value | Bring Cash for discount

Combo A ($50 reg/ $48 cash)
Great selection and filling too. Comes with grilled appetizers  (the beef skewers are good!) along with fresh items for steaming, dessert and if you add  $10-25 for special soup base it will definitely fill you up.
You can even watch the shellfish pop open when cooked under steamer.

Grilled Foie Gras ($18/order 2oz ea)
Big piece done to perfection served on a toast. One piece is about 6\" in length. 

Chicken Tenderous Bone ($4/ 2 skewers)
Pretty delicious!

Spain Iberico Pork Kebob  ($10/ 2 skewers)
Fatty and seasoned well. The salt or seasoning they used reminded me of truffle.

Good service: often change our plates and when one of our mussels didn't open (uncooked), the server Susan generously gave us 2 more to retry so we're not missing out on any. However one of them still didnt open but it was out of her control. 
When the steam kept blowing in my face she would often check up on me and attach a paper towel around the steamer so it doesn't blow at me.

Bring cash: On the menu there are regular prices and cash price which is a good $10/ person saved at least.

They have a wide selection of sake, wine, beer available for purchase.

The bathroom: the bathroom is designed \"out of this worldly\". You'll know what I mean when you go in. Although it's nice, it deters from the rest of the restaurant's theme.

Check out my photos for menu, open hours and special items."}
{"text":"The seafood is really fresh. The congee was extremely tasty. I find it really expensive and keep in mind I don't mind paying to eat good food. Overall not bad.  If your server is Eric I highly recommend you sit somewhere else. Not a very polite server and very sloppy"}
{"text":"Very expensive, however worth the experience.

I was here with some clients, we all were very satisfied and amazed with the food. It costed 400-500 for 4 people. We did order some expensive items. 

I probably wouldn't visit regularly due to the price, but it is a good place to take clients."}

{"text":"Came here with my family yesterday for a birthday celebration. The service was not bad. Seafood was very fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the congee base we selected because after an hour of steaming,  it was really flavorful! 

Price wise is on the higher end.  For 5 people, we ordered combo c and a and a few side dishes (skewers)  and it came to around $360.00. 

Final verdict: would I come here again?  Absolutely,  but only for special occasion."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've experienced a \"steam pot\" type of restaurant. Unlike the traditional hot pot, all the meat, veggies and seafood were cooked using steam which left all their flavours intact. The seafood was amazing and fresh as well. We had the rice bean and Dace fish soup base. After we've finished our food, we get to drink the soup base which contained all flavour from the seafood we've steamed. It was a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place. Can say that it is a great place.

The atmosphere is fantastic. It is well renovated and the feel is great. The only problem is that the buffet table with the sauces were a little bit empty. The drinks on the shelves had to be paid for. 

The seafood was really fresh. I recommend the seafood as it was tasty. The angus beef and the chicken was not really good though. I would avoid it possible. 

The price was expensive. The combo that we got was approximately $50 per person cash. I didn't pay, so I can only guess. 

Overall, I would go back"}
{"text":"The idea behind Day & Night Angus Beef Hot Pot is that they are not just any regular \"hot pot\" restaurant.  Instead, they use steam cooking (????) in order to ensure that all of their seafood and meats are served fresh with the original tastes and flavours intact.  In other words, it is \"an innovative way of serving hot pot, keeping the food as fresh as possible with no extra additives\".  Their intention is also for you to enjoy food the way it is meant to be served -- natural and without seasoning.  In our busy world, it is so easy to get caught up eating processed and over-seasoned food that our taste buds become over sensitized.  At Day & Night Angus Beef Hot Pot, you can re-introduce your taste buds to enjoy food in its natural state again!

I was next also very impressed with the Grilled Spain Iberico Pork Kebab.  Iberico Pork Kebabs are not cheap and this pork meat was definitely high-quality.  I loved how it was slightly seasoned with some salt and white sesame seeds but otherwise maintained its true taste (just like the beef kebab).  I could already tell that I was in for an amazing rest of the night because the ingredients used were just so premium and delicious!

The Vancouver Clams were the first seafood to go inside of the steamer.  These Vancouver clams were steamed for two minutes.  After the two minutes were up, the steamer beeped to let you know that they were done.  I loved this technology!  I also really delighted in watching each of the clams open up as they were being steamed.  I took many videos throughout the night to capture this experience too -- a photo or two wouldn't do it enough justice.

The taste of the steamed lobster was definitely fresh.  It's important to have fresh seafood when you are steaming the food like this otherwise it's very easy to tell when something is not fresh.  The taste of the steamed lobster was so fresh that it actually reminded me of the seafood that I have had in Hong Kong before.  Hong Kong has some of the best tasting and freshest seafood in the world because they are a fishing city and have access to live seafood all the time.  I was impressed to be tasting such similarly fresh-tasting seafood here right in the GTA!  (And that is rare!)"}
{"text":"Wow!surprisingly this was just across from our hotel. Dinner was awesome. Yika, the waitress was friendly and all the specials she recommended was superb. Fresh seafood and plus they steam the food on your table. My friends and I had an awesome time, lots of joy n laughter. Love the interior design with Chinese characters over the window. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 rating. Really nice interior, very clean, the bathrooms are out of this world.. seriously check out the bathroom and not be impressed. The service was very helpful for anyone new to the restaurant. 

I had the seafood Groupon that included lobster and mussels. There's a soup that uses the flavor of the seafood from the steam that is a tad boring after you eat the delicious seafood.

It was an experience that I would recommend. However, it is quite pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Overpriced gimmick. What makes this place different is that they steam the food instead of boiling it in the broth the only problem is this makes the entire process long and tedious. Ordered the combo c for 4 people that was $250! Came with a bunch of seafood such as lobster, muscles, clams, fish, and some beef and veggies. The seafood food tasted nice and fresh, all except for the beef. The beef is supposed to be their specialty since its in their name and is cetified angus beef. It was chewy and tasted off, kind of a metalic taste. The portions felt small and after paying so much, only felt half full by the end of the meal.

The main problem is that they steam every item one at a time. The server bring one dish and steams it on your table for you, then you wait 10 minutes, they take it off and serve you then they disappear. They come back 15 minutes later and put another item on the rack to steam, rinse and repeat. The whole process took 3 hours for them to get through cooking the whole set of dishes. The table broke down on us also so they had to switch to cooking the food elsewhere. It would be nice if they just started cooking the next dish right after finishing the other. Instead you find yourself waiting so long that youre already done your dish for several minutes before they even start cooking the next. Came on a weekday where it was pretty empty so it wasnt an issue of them being distracted by other customers. Other than that the service was great, they were attentive and did all the work for you.

One other thing, the washroom is... an experience. The purple lighting makes it very hard to see in there. Quite a jump from a clean modern restaurant to a disco in the toilet."}
{"text":"Steamed Hotpot is a new trend in Toronto which started in China.  I had it in China 2 months ago when I was visiting and liked it, so I really wanted to try the same experience in Toronto.  Cherie recommended me this place, so for my birthday celebration I decided to host it here.

Prices are very expensive here, they have three different combos, A is around 45$ + tax per head, B is around 75$ + tax and C is around 105$ + tax.  We all went with combo B because it comes with the pork skewers and lobsters.  Choosing your base is another $10 extra per pot.

First, let's start off with the skewers.  The Angus beef skewers was just an okay, not too flavourful and is a little overcooked.  The pork skewers on the other hand was AMAZING! Very flavourful and the texture of the pork was great, very chewy!

Next is all the steam items, pretty much all the seafood you can think of, they had clams, mussels, lobster, oysters and squids, near the end, they had chicken and vegetables.  All seafood was fresh except for the mussels and oysters which tasted a little \"fishy\". My friends found the seafood not as flavourful which was expected because everything is steamed with no additional ingredients on the food, so you can dip your food in their pre-made dipping sauce to boost the taste buds.

Highlight of the whole experience is probably the congee we opted for. This is serve at the end underneath the silver plate where all the food you had was sitting on and steamed. All the seafood, chicken and vegetables flavours dripped into the congee which made it super fresh! I had three bowls of this congee myself despite being very full after all the seafood!  It also comes with a unique dessert but it was just an okay.

Overall experience was great, but this is one of those one and done meal for me due to the price.  I would rather spend similar amount of money at Yu Seafood or fishmen lobsters to have their seafood feast."}
{"text":"I know this is expensive but I will come back since I like the steam pot style and there is no other place to go."}
{"text":"The owner has invested a lot in renovating this venue to create an upscale steamed hot pot restaurant. I love the ambience here, it is not your typical hotpot place in town! That in itself warrants a visit.

The server is extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We had the Groupon coupons and she gave us a slew of suggestions to max our package and experience! 

The four of us had a huge crab, a lobster, clams and mussels! The soup base was wintermelon with mushrooms and chicken. These were uncooked but at the end of the meal, it turned into bowls of delish soup!

The server was meticulous in suggesting how long each food item should be steamed for: 4 mins for lobsters and crabs and four for clams and mussels! They were cooked to the tee. The mussels were big and meaty, the lobsters and crab were perfectly cooked! 

This is an awesome place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've never tried steam hotpot before, but decided to try Day & Night after hearing a lot of positive things from friends. After dining here this past Thanksgiving, I am very happy that I brought my family here so we could try steam hotpot altogether ~

The best way to get the most value from your meal is to choose one of their different set combos. You can order ingredients individually, but there are option for each combo where you get a special price if you pay cash. For example Combo C for 4 people regularly costs $349, but if you pay cash, you save around 40% and pay $248 instead. I had also added Alaskan king crab to our meal, which was quite pricey at $50 per lb. 

To be quite honest, I am unsure why the called this place Angus Beef Hot Pot as beef wasn't much of an emphasis. Most of the combos consisted of seafood, but you can tell that the freshness and quality of the ingredients were definitely there. My only complaint is how I wished they asked you which ingredients to cook. If you eat one ingredient, the server does not cook the next item until you are finished. I wish they mixed up the ingredients as I prefer to eat lots of veggies with my meals, and veggies were not served until the end. However, this is something I will ask about in the future.

Service was A+. The best part of this experience is how you get a server who cooks all the food right in front of you. All the steamers have timers and beep once the food is ready to be served. Our waitress was very kind;  she was attentive and made good recommendations to accommodate our needs.

Altogether, our meal costed around $650 before taxes and tip. Day & Night is not an everyday place to dine at, but a good place to splurge during any upcoming occasion, or if you just want to try steam hot pot in general."}
{"text":"Steam pots are quite popular in Hong Kong, so it's quite exciting to see something similar in Toronto. Firstly, the focus at this restaurant is seafood and therefore, be prepared to pay a premium.
We came here once before and an ordered a seafood meal which was in the range of $80 per person.  This time, we opted for a bit of a healthier route and ordered a coconut chicken soup meal. We also ordered more chicken and vegetables to go with it.
One thing that shines is the amazing service. If you've never been to hotpot/steampot, the idea is all the ingredients are for your meal are brought to you raw and cooked in the pot in the center of your table. At this establishment, all the cooking is done by your server. On top of that, the waiters were very helpful, informative and tried to make sure we had a good time. 
We also saw another table order two rack of ribs which smelled and looked amazing so I will definitely try that next time.
Ingredients are fresh, servers are pleasant and all in a peaceful surrounding. 
We will definitely comeback on a special occasion."}
{"text":"I came to Day & Night Angus Beef Hot Pot with my family for dinner. We heard a lot of good things about the quality of food and decided to give it a try! Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and did a great job portioning the amount of food. We came at around 6:30 pm and was very surprised to see a lot of empty tables, only one or two tables were taken. There is a sauce-bar close to the front of the restaurant for you to create your own dipping sauce. I chose a few items but I didn't really use the sauce throughout the night because the original seafood items were fresh and didn't need any additional flavour, or else it would've cover the freshness of the taste!
We ordered Combo B ($96 or $75 per person depending on if you're paying in cash or on card). 

How it works: It is similar to your traditional hot pot except everything is steamed. Your assigned server will cook the meal for you. Each item of your meal has a set timer. Once the food is cooked, the steamer would beep and your server would distribute the food for you. 

BROTH BASE:
* CONGEE (5/5)
I'd highly recommend choosing \"Congee / Porridge\" as the broth base. This broth is an additional $10 but I thought this was the best part of the meal! The congee absorbs everything that has been cooking in your steamer throughout the night so it becomes super flavourful. I usually haaate congee and I'm giving this a 5/5..!!

- COMBO B -

APPETIZERS:
* Grilled U.S. Certified Angus Beef kebab (4/5)
The beef was delicious! Very tender :)

* Grilled Spain Iberico Pork kebab (5/5)
What is thisss!? SO yummy! Its texture tasted like the meat from the pork's neck area. It's chewy and delicious.

SEAFOOD:
* Canadian PEI Lobster
* Vancouver Jumbo Clam 
(They weren't kidding about \"jumbo\" because the clam meat was actually pretty big haha).
* Canadian Fresh Oyster
* Saltspring Mussel
* Vietnamese Cuttlefish

SEAFOOD HIGHLIGHTS - My favourites from the seafood choices were the lobster, clams and oysters. They were all very fresh and delicious! Steamed oysters tastes exactly like raw oysters (or maybe it's because they didn't cook it for that long, but my dad insisted they were fully cooked haha). Mussels were mediocre and the cuttlefishes were fresh, but had barely any taste. The cuttlefishes were the only seafood item that we needed to dip extra sauce for.

VEGETABLES (6 choices in total):
* Mushrooms
* Pumpkin
* Lettuce
* Enoki mushrooms
* Fungi 
* Taro

DESSERT:
* Vanilla Ice cream with Pastry, Pudding"}
{"text":"Very fresh.  Service could have been better.  Didnt like how the hole or garbage attached to the table was only on one side...which meant person on the end would need to help the others clear their plates of shells & bones.  Had to work hard to flag down waiters to get water refill, napkins, etc.  Service was a little slow.  Definitely had better service at other restaurants of the same concept.
Steamed seafood & chicken in the combos.  U can order combos or individually.  Dessert was nicely presented.  They have bbq Skewers too.  Definitely worth a try.  Pricy for a reason.  The combos r more than enough no need to order extra food."}
{"text":"Great option for steam hotpot! The ingredients are fresh and very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable servers. The restaurant is spacious, comfortable seating, and they have a private room. We ended up ordering a combo for 4 people which included: appetizers was tofu and pork neck skewers, lobster, crab, mussels, clams, abalone, beef, fish, vegetables, soup or congee, and dessert."}
{"text":"It is an expensive restaurant as you'll definitely have a 3-digit bill at the end of it. There is probably a 90% chance just because there is nothing cheap here. 

That said you probably wonder if it is worth it. Short answer: perhaps. The quality of steamed seafood is much better than I had thought - they're very precise with their measured timing in cooking the food and very healthy. Evidently that's because it's all steamed!

At the very end of it all you get to drink the soup from all of the good seafood steamed. Mmm delicious.

Check out more photos for what you get - mindful that the best combination is probably going for the Combo meals. Important tip: bring cash!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. I love hot pot and steam pot in general, but this is way overpriced and they would make up stories, tell lies and do literally anything to grab every penny from you! Moreover, it's got the WORST SERVICE EVER!! DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for seafood lovers! Tofu skewers are a must try. Overall good experience. (Not Hot Pot as advertised- more of a High Pressure / steam cooking method but nonetheless food taste healthy and tasty!) Loved the crab legs and shell fish."}
{"text":"Brought my parents to the restaurant 2 weeks ago, to celebrate mother's day and my father's birthday. Overall it was great experience and the food is great.

environment 5/5
service 5/5
food 4/5

I love the environment. The decor is simple and fitting. Also, the table is huge, so you have plenty of room (unlike many other restaurants).

Service is great. The server does does the \"cooking\" for you, and set the timer. In our case, the server was always there when the food is ready. We went on a week day, so the restaurant was half full. It might be a challenge if the restaurant is filled. Server is very knowledgeable of the food and the cooking method. Also, very friendly. My parents had a good time chatting with her.

For three of us, we ordered combo C for two and some a la cart items. They had to make a few replacement to the combo items, but we were not informed about it at the time of ordering.The congee base is a must. It tasted sooo good.The Spain iberico pork kebab wasn't that impressive, but the Spain iberico pork jowl meat kebab is great. The seafood tasted good and very fresh, but not super impressive. You can make your own sauce, but it's the typical selections you see at any AYCE hot pot place.

Not a cheap meal, so bring cash to take advantage of the discount.

Considering only the food and the price, I might give it 3/5, but the service is great and it is a very unique experience. So 4/5 overall."}
{"text":"Nice place to bring or meet up with friends. Dinner is slow paced. Seafood is fresh, but I think that the price is a bit too much for the kind of dinner that we had. Service is so so. Not too impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh and juicey seafood, melt-in-your-mouth steaks skewers, exceptional customer service, beautifully decorated dining area, big open space, very comfortable, great for families and couples. Dessert was carefully crafted. **DO NOT LET THE COMBO PRICE FOOL/SCARE YOU! IT IS FOR 2 PEOPLE** It may look scary at first, but if you think about it, that's average dinner price at most places out there (with much lower food quality too). Quality at Day and Night is consistently fresh and top notch. Great value. Remember to bring CASH for a discount!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and pretty much everything was sold out. Crab was sold out, shrimp was sold out. Everything but mussels, clams and geoduck wasn't sold out. So sad, didn't get to fully experience the restaurant. 

The design and decor of the place is really simple and clean. The place is really big and very organized. 
Additionally, the design of the washroom is really unique and was very clean.

Opinions of the food: 

Ordered the Beef skewers were really chewy and tough. Not recommended. 

Foie gras was ok, tasted similar to any other foie gras. The portion was small. 

Lobster was fresh but when steamed it lacked flavour. Had to use the soy sauce or fish sauce to enhace it. 

Geoduck is really good, it was fresh. It was eaten in two ways, steam vs. sashimi style. I preferred the steam version more. They offered two different sauces that accompanied this dish. One was fish sauce, the other was soy sauce both complimented the geoduck well.  

Service was good, the waiter were friendly and were able to explain everything to us. She pretty much cooked all our food for us too. 

As for the menu, they offer set meals and a la carte. 

Overall decent but pricey."}
{"text":"Visited this place after work last night with a buddy of mine around 9:30PM.
No wait time, but the restaurant was fairly filled up, the tables are huge!  I've always wanted to try something like this since my dad sent me videos of these steaming pot places from China.

I must say the service at the table here is phenomenal, they are always checking up to make sure everything is okay, but of course because they need to cook the food for you.
I walked in with the mindset that it would be mandarin people, but they're actually cantonese, and english is great too!

We ordered Combo A, the seafood was very fresh and in a good portion.  The chicken that came with our combo was average, not too much taste but maybe because it's steamed.  I would definitely come back to the place, but not often, and the only reason I'm rating it 4 stars, is because it's quite expensive.  If you're walking in you're expecting to spend AT LEAST $50 per person, but for the experience, you should at least try it once!

PS.
If you walk into the bathroom, you might feel like you're in a club. LOL"}
{"text":"It was OK. The server i had didn't seem like he wanted to really serve us. The food was fresh and good but so over priced. The service was slow and i hated that the server had to do all the clamping and what not for the hot pot so we always had to waive him down. There was probably only like 2 tables at the time as well. 

For desert it was like ice cream - there was 6 of us but they gave only 5 desert cause of our order ... way to go. like you couldn't have thrown in another scoop lol on top of a $1000 meal"}
{"text":"Steam hotpot is popular in Hong Kong but not very common in Toronto. I think this is the first restaurant to offer this style of cooking, which is essentially a large steamer at your table where everything is cooked. I like it because it's a very healthy way of cooking. Most of the items are fresh seafood, and you select a congee or broth base that sits at the bottom and absorbs all the juices from the seafood. 

They offer a number of set combos but we decided to order individual items that we wanted to eat. We got Alaskan crab, Vancouver jumbo clams, some veggies like corn, the congee base, and some Angus beef skewers. The server chose the crab for us which was HUGE. It was really good and fresh but probably way more crab than I wanted to eat in one sitting. The clams were also really good and it was funny watching them slowly open in the glass steamer as they cook. The Angus beef was very mediocre so I'm glad we didn't order that many skewers.

The overall experience is good, as you get a designated server who cooks all the food for you, and the steamer actually beeps when each food is done cooking for her to come over and serve it. 

All that being said, this place is expensive and to be honest I'm not sure if it's worth it. My meal was great but at $200+ per person I would expect it to be. Definitely not a place for your average everyday dinner but more of a splurge."}
{"text":"First time here with fd. The plan was to try \"HOT POT\" angus beef, turns out not what we were expecting. 

Let's start with service 
At first the server was very polite, took the time to explain the menu but everything started to went down hill 
For that I give them 3/5 stars

Food
So this place is actually \"Steam Pot\" with seafoods.  There is 3 combo you can choose from but all of them is mostly seafoods. 
I will break them down as follow
Fresh seafood 5/5 
Angus Beef 2/5 (beef has no beef taste)
Taste 1/5 (I guess you are suppose to taste the seafood)
 
Price
WAY OVER PRICED 
4oz so call \"angus beef\" $12-16 
Seafood combo range $48-$99 

For this amount I had better somewhere else 

Overall
Would not recommend this place unless you REALLY want to try STEAM FOOD"}
{"text":"Coming here dinner with friends was expecting beef hot pot. I have to admit I was excited. But then when I sat down it was quite a surprise, it is a steamer that where food is place in the center, there wasn't any pictures to take, most of the pic you find here is adequate for explanation.  We are present with a piece of paper, a menu, some say it's self explanatory, I'm just confused looking at it. The server just don't seem to be friendly enough to explain how this works even when I ask twice, maybe it's because my mom didn't make me handsome enough or I'm just too dumb.  Eventually we figure things out by randomly ordering or what I call it ordering everything on the menu. 

The kebab is just different cuts of angus beef or pork with the light salt. Nothing technical, just as simple as it gets. 

Then the disappointment came, the slice of beef was steam with your soup base, no seasoning, no salt just as plain as it gets. I mean you can dip it with your sauce but it's still plain all the way inside. 

The finish was the soup base that you cook your food with, the congee we ordered, again in its natural state, just cooked, it's as tasteless as it gets.

If I want to taste something in natural state or eat something healthy, I would just eat at home. If You can appreciate the taste of plain boiled beef, just as simple as it is, this restaurant is for you."}
