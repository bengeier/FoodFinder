{"text":"Incredible!!! You could tell that each dish was made fresh with all organic produce and meat. Our table ordered pho, chicken fried rice, edamame beans, and green tea. The bowls of pho were huge and incredibly priced.  On top of this, the staff was so friendly and we got our food very quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered the vegetable rice noodle pho, the special beef combo pho, summer rolls, and vegetable fried rice.  Everything was delicious!  The phos were enough food for two meals.  We order delivery so I can't speak to service but we really enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"My fiancé commented on the freshness, and it was apparent. VERY fresh. Delicious. Best Pho in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch today and had one of the best bowls of bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) I've had in a long time, and I grew up in a Vietnamese household!  If you're an adventurous eater who loves spicy food, I highly recommend ordering this dish.  My server was very kind and polite as well.  She even kept my hat safe when I had forgotten it on my chair and came back for it later!  Can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!  A word of warning: their location can be very easy to miss.  If you're traveling south on Longmore St, it's probably easier to look first for the Oasis Christian Center just south of the Target; the restaurant's just to the right of the Center."}
{"text":"A truly hidden gem for Phoenix, I was craving for Vietnamese, bun bo hue, one night and found this place on Yelp. I'm very picky about Vietnamese food since I grew up in the Bay Area and my sister is an excellent cook. But I must say, this place is legit. Great tasting food and no MSG! They also have a special menu, I'll definitely try one of those next time. Come to check this place out and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"(Sorry first review) Service was great. I had no problems with the staff. It is sorta cramped, but not enough to affect you as much. Interesting thing here was that at the end of the meal they gave out a small bowl of chè, so it was sorta like what some Chinese restaurants do with fortune cookies. There was music too, which was nice and classy."}
{"text":"Small and local placed owned by a very nice family. Flavors were good, maybe little too sweet side, and service was prompt and very attentive. I recommend branching out out from pho at Vietnamese restaurants and get the lotus salad, it was crunchy and fresh. Also, try the bun bo hue and crab udon noodles if you haven't had it."}
{"text":"My first time for Vietnamese food....what was i waiting for....this place was delicious.   Went for lunch today and the server was fantastic and food was fresh and tasty....plan to return soon.      Came back for more yesterday....the staff remembered us and treated us to a delicious meal...the food is incredible...love the mint/strawberry water, so refreshing...im glad we are not snowbirds, so we can enjoy u guys all year round"}
{"text":"The hospitality and service was excellent! The family who owns the restaurant is so sweet. Can't forget to mention that the food was delicious! Ordered Pho Tai Bo Vien and there was a good amount of flavor and NO MSG! Also ordered the egg rolls and banh cuon which were very good as well! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered two sets of noodles, one was served and the next took 30 minutes to receive (and by then I had to leave). The soy sauce bottle on the table was crusted over, the chili oil was empty and only had peppers left in it, and the fish sauce was watered down. The spring rolls were made with iceberg lettuce, which took them down a notch. The server and manager came over to apologize for the wait and gave us 20% off, which was kind, but the food was not high quality so I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start? The service was phenomenal. The hostess and waiter were attentive to our every need.  For your information, the menu is larger than the few options you see on their website. They should probably put the whole menu online so people can see the many available dishes, appetizers, desserts, and smoothies.  We decided to try this restaurant because of their vegan options and we were not disappointed! The menu has an entire page of vegan options with soy chicken, soy shrimp, soy pork, and tofu as options. Our food was fantastic! The non-vegans enjoyed their meals as well, so Saigon Jade got it right for everyone's food preferences.  I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious water, which was lightly infused with local citrus and mint. I know I've found a quality establishment when they pay attention to the little details, such as water. Also, they use non-GMO rice, which is rare for restaurants to do (in my experience). Go ahead and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good, just lack of ambience. Must try the Bird Nest (Seafood Crispy Egg Noodles), which is hardly found in other Asian restaurants. Special Stuffed Pancake is superb if one likes Chinese \"Cheong Fun\". Food was prepared freshly. Will come again."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food that I've had in a long, long time. Everything tastes so fresh and delicious. The hostess , Ana, was so sweet and helpful. Authentic! Go and go again. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food.. I spent 21 days in Vietnam and loved the food. I finally found good Vietnam food in Phoenix. Love the fast service and nice people."}
{"text":"Grand opening! New restaurant and friendly services.  Offer 20% off for grand opening!  Hurry and find out more while offer still available. Their menu have a lot of selection."}
{"text":"Updated: love this business! I ordered from this restaurant again, hoping they had followed through with what they said and they definitely changed the paper and I enjoyed the food no problem! Excellent food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. The pig blood in the noodle was so not ready and tasted nasty and ruined the soup. The rest was okay"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options !!! I had the pineapple fried rice and it was really good, I had it delivered so I can't comment on the service but I was very impressed with the food :)"}
{"text":"This place has completely exceeded my expectations! My sister and I are both vegan and were looking for a place to eat for dinner and saw this place just opened up with a full vegan menu!! (They also serve non-vegan options and they deliver)  It's a cute, small, family-owned business in a great spot; located about 5 minutes from the freeway and within walking distance to Mesa Community College. There's plenty of places to park as well.  We were greeted by our lovely waiter as soon as we walked through the door and were sat immediately. The place is very clean and the bathroom was clean as well. We were given two menus; one with all the food and the other with all the drinks and desserts. I started off with a refreshing, ice cold water infused with oranges and mint and my sister got a thai ice tea with coconut cream which I took a sip of and it's fantastic. We browsed the vegan menu for a bit and decided to get spring rolls, vegan pho, and later we ordered sticky mango rice and fried banana rolls. The food, drinks, and dessert were fairly priced and the portion sizes were huge! My sister ended up having to take her entree and dessert to go.  On taste critique, the spring rolls were fantastic. Nice and light while filling you up. The same goes for the vegan pho. It came with a variety of vegetables like bok choy and mushrooms, to name a few, and tofu! The broth was airy and fresh. To finish both desserts were tasty and felt healthy as the fried banana rolls were not too oily and the sticky mango rice had a lighter, not too intense sweet taste. I love this restaurant's emphasis on not only great tasting food, but their dedication to fresh ingredients and no MSG. The service was excellent as well, as we were visited multiple times to fill up on water and ask about the food.  All in all, I wish I could give this place higher than 5 stars. They hit it out of the park on every aspect; location, cleanliness, service, and food. If I lived closer, I'd be here all the time! My advice is to start coming before word spreads and this place gets packed!!!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp pho and my husband had the special beef combo pho and they were both amazing! We also tried the spring rolls and the Banh Mi sandwich and they exceeded our expectations  and the staff was so nice a friendly, we will for sure be coming back here!  And I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I've only done delivery from this restaurant but I can't wait to come in to eat one day! The delivery usually takes about 30-45 minutes via grub hub but it always arrives super fresh and organized! I usually don't expect much from Asian take out food because it usually arrives cold, super oily and not very pretty. Saigon jade on the other hand labels their takeout boxes and keeps all the different foods inside the box separated so that the sauces don't mix and the steam from the rice doesn't make the entire box watery. The side salad was cold, crisp and still colorful rather than being all browned and soggy from being in the same bag as my warm food. Everything tasted amazing"}
{"text":"this place is amazing!! they serve orange and mint infused water. the staff is so friendly and accomodating for dietary restrictions. they have a whole page for vegan entrees, appetizers, and soups."}
{"text":"Came back again today to try Mi Vit Tiem (roasted duck soup with egg noodles) and wish I could give them 10stars. It's just so amazingly tasty and I'll be back to try out other dishes"}
{"text":"The Pai Thai noodles were stuck together and mushy. The tofu tasted like rubber. I will never order from this place again. My other food was disgusting."}
{"text":"Overall awesome experience, and it was just takeout! They packaged up our prefer so nicely, and the portions were really big! The vermicelli bowls definitely did not disappoint. The staff was all very friendly, and get and A+ for customer service! My husband and I can't wait to go back to dine in!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just open, but it literally have the best beef and noodle. Especially the spicy beef rice noodle will take your breath away. The most appetizer that is really good is Fine thin vermicelli is absolutely amazing. I just love it so much. Egg roll and the sweet fish sauce is whoooo. 10, 10,10 across the board people. If you guys need to this restaurant, you guys should try out some rice noddle. They make it so good."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile now, and I finally decided to order take out when I was craving pho. I'm super glad I did! The order itself was ready in less than 20 minutes. I was a bit nervous ordering pho for takeout because I've definitely had orders that were poorly packaged where the broth would leak, but no problems here! The pho itself was really good and the staff was super friendly.   The location itself is small but homey. They also have a decent selection of vegetarian options which is neat.  This is my new go-to place for takeout pho because of how quick and easy the process is! Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat.  Great food and a very pleasant experience.  Best Pho I've had in the valley, and I've tried 3 other places."}
{"text":"WOW  this place is so great! I drove here from Queen Creek and it was 100% worth the drive. It's right off the highway so it was easy  I came for the vegan menu and they have a good selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts!! Our server was SO incredibly nice, he made me feel so welcome!! There's NO MSG in any of their food and they use fresh and local ingredients. I wish it was closer to my house, but I'll definitely be driving here a few times a month to get some good food !!! Great atmosphere !!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and they were so nice. I ordered take out and picked up my order. After getting back to the office I realized I got chicken curry instead of vegetarian curry. I called the restaurant and the young man immediately said he would deliver the vegetarian curry right away.  So great! Curry is amazing and their mango rice is a delicious treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Vietnamese food. We found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try, and I am so glad we did!   The moment you walk in, you can smell the delicious spices in the broth from the pho soup. I decided on a pho, while my husband tried the thin rice vermicelli. The broth from my soup was salty, a bit sweet from the star anise, and had a very slight spice at the end from pepper. The combination of flavors was perfect and just what I hoped for. You can tell this soup has been simmered for hours and cooked with love   If you have never tried pho, check this place out! I've tried several places around the valley and have never had pho this good before!"}
{"text":"Staff was very helpful and friendly. Food was excellent!! The chicken pho and vegan pho were delicious! We ordered online and by the time we arrived the order was ready. A new local favorite!!"}
{"text":"Sooo it is our first time here, and I gotta say they have the most delicious Chicken curry (very authentic) vietnamese style. The service was nice, and the place is neat and clean. Their food is without MSG which is another plus for me. Will definitely coming back. Goodwork Saigon Jade."}
{"text":"We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Saigon Jade Restaurant! The best of the very best Pho and Vietnamese cuisine in town! The Chefs/owners display great care and pleasure in food preparation which create a pleasant and warm dining experience for all guests. With roasted crispy duck over fresh homemade noodles engulfed in riveting Chef's signature creamy sauce or tender hunks of meat and sweet potato in delicate curry broth; this hidden gem signifies the tradition and authenticity of Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Good. Not great. The beef soup was darker than I'm used to and greasy. They didn't skim the fat off the top like other places.  I did enjoy the cold salad they made with pickled veggies, pork, and shrimp. Just a little heavy on the sugar. But it was refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant so far in the valley! Stopped by for a late Sunday lunch and we ordered the spring rolls as appetizers, they were delicious! Filled with shrimp, pork and all fresh, plus a dipping sauce on the side, very refreshing.  My main meal was the super scrumptious duck noodle specialty dish... Can't remember the name of the dish on the menu but our awesome, friendly waiter mentioned that it was the healthiest meal on the menu. I think the menu said that as well.  Regardless, the broth was quite tasty with an umami flavor that reminded me of my mom's homemade chicken soup. Lots of bok choy and and mushrooms added in. The duck was cooked to perfection, moist and tender with a crispy skin. The noodles soaked up the broth quite well.  The seafood Bon Rieu had some tasty seafood pâte type meatballs added in and broth was spicy and perfection as well.  Will definitely be back for the exact same dishes, service was the best too!"}
