{"text":"We went for dinner and the buffet was good. The price is very reasonable. 

We also tried the samosa plate, I think it is also called thaali. 

I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic veggie Indian food.   Load up a tray of a few spicy dishes and soak up all the good sauces with super fresh naan."}
{"text":"Food is sub par and far from tasting like authentic food.

Our last visit there, food did taste like it was cooked days ago and wasn't fresh at all. Dripping with oil.

Customer service is good though."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food money can buy. We live 3hrs North and always stop on our way past and always stop on our way home to stock up. Friendly owners and staff and always look forward to our trip south because of this restaurant. Till next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant i see in my life . One man show . Think 20 tome before u go.We went with family for a dinner. Ruined our evening come back with bad experience."}
{"text":"The thali here is very good... I usuallygo fr lunch here although its all vegetarian bt the food is good. Its usually packed during lunch. The staff is very friendly as well...its a must try..very affordable and tasty food"}
{"text":"This was my familys favourite indian restaurant.  We would go here once every two weeks. They had the best samosas and Tamarind sauce we have ever tasted and some of the best butter chicken!

It is really sad to see this place close, but there was hardly ever any customers. The staff were so kind and great to talk to. I really hope they reopen!"}
{"text":"Decent enough food, and the server was very friendly.  The samosas and tamarind sauce are amazing!  It's worth coming here just for that."}
{"text":"This is my first ever visit to the restaurant after their long due renovation. I have been there few times before to buy samosas and sweets but never actually sat down inside. 

For one, I was surprised that they changed from a vegetarian restaurant to serving both non veg and veg dishes. I came to know of this last week when going to buy samosas and sweets. What was really interesting was the fact that on their business card it still said \"vegetarian\" but inside they served non veg dishes to. Any how, I guess to each their own. 

That being said, for the price of  $9.99 per person, the choices of dishes, the ambiance, the service, the quality of food, I would give it a 3 star rating. Why? Well, they lost the 1 star for the following:

1) Service was slow, in terms to get the empty plates collected, having the glasses refilled with water and so forth. It was not a busy night, perhaps 60% busy - around 7:45PM to 8:45PM I would say. The server did not come and ask around if we needed water, or if we needed anything else, etc. 

2) The naan was not soft at all nor had that \"taste\" I've had better and I've had worse, and I would say this falls in between. Yes I know I am bit harsh when it comes to critiquing Indian dishes, but hey after all I am an Indian and being one I expect quality of food to be on par with other range of Indian buffets. 

3) The peas pulao/plain rice was not cooked properly despite the quantity of rice being served. 

4) Finally for the dahi (yogurt/curd) they could have kept it slightly colder besides at room temperature. 

So with the cons, here are the pros:

1) Taste of the rest of the veg dishes were nice (I'm a vegetarian by the way). The spice, sweetness and overall taste did meet my expectations. I.e. the gravy dishes and the dry vegetable dishes. 

2) Ambiance was fantastic, the chandeliers were great. The space inside was perfect especially during the lineups at the buffet counter.

3) Having the vegetarian dishes separate from the non veg dishes was actually quiet satisfying unlike other buffet restaurants which they keep it right beside each other. Meaning it was on the opposite side of the aisle so to speak. 

Overall, I would probably visit this restaurant but don't think I will any time soon as I am sure there are other similar or if not better restaurants out there that serve buffet during dinner. However on the bright side, I will give this a +1 or a one up over Gagan Sweets which is in the Vaughan area as well. 

Until then I bid adieu"}
{"text":"This is our third time at this place. Very good food, fresh naan, mango lassy is excellent. Lots of vegetarian and meat dishes. My favorite is goat curry, so yummy. The best time to come here is around 5, much fresher."}
{"text":"The restaurant is relatively large, but with few customers the two times I dropped by. The first time I came was for dinner; there were no customers inside (it was roughly around 6pm on a weekday) so my friend and I decided to eat somewhere else. The second time, I went with 5 others for lunch, there were about 3-4 other tables occupied. The food was okay nothing spectacular but for the price I guess there's no harm in trying. I would have given it a 4-star, but they didn't bother restocking the meat dishes that ran out. They did however restock the vegetarian dishes.

There weren't many meat dishes, which was fine; however when my group arrived there was only a bit of goat curry and some sort of grilled chicken I believe. We took a bit and there was pretty much nothing left. During the whole seating they did not bring out more even though it was clearly almost empty (there was 1 piece of chicken left and for the goat curry it was mostly just the curry with no meat left inside). I would return if someone wanted to go, but I wouldn't have it as my first pick."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. the staff was extremely rude and i have to wait 20 minutes for a roti. it was unreal.

and any time i asked for info on a menu item the waiter was ignorant.

i would strongly suggest people do not eat here. there are alot better places to eat indian food."}
{"text":"This place has the worst samosas ever!!! And its 2/$1! Usually samosas have vegetables inside it, this was just potatoes, it had nothing but potato and 1 pea. It felt like you were eating mash potatoes in dough, thats how much the potato was overcooked. No one ate it, $20 went to garbage. Woodbridge people don't know any better thats why you're still in business sadly."}
{"text":"Indian lunch buffet 10.99 includes over 50 different dishes.  Chaat papri, desserts, and lots of meat (goat curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, curry chicken & veggie (paneer dishes, pankoras, spring rolls,etc) options.  Ice cream too!"}
{"text":"You know, if I had written this review after my first visit, it easily would have been 4 stars.  The value for the price (I thought) was very good, especially considering that it was not only a lunch but also dinner price.  The quality of the food itself was acceptable, and the staff were friendly, especially the actual wait staff, who cleared dishes and checked to see if I wanted additional naan bread (which dough was cooked to order) throughout my meal.

Then, I came back for another visit.  The staff who greeted me this time was more interested in dealing with a personal exchange with someone while I obviously waited.  The meal itself was more or less what I had experienced on my first visit.  When it came time to settle the bill, however (which is not printed and presented at table, customers go straight to the cash and the total is tallied directly on the register), I was charged a dollar more ($10.99 vs. the $9.99 price as advertised on the outside signage and which I had been charged previously).  When I asked about this, the staff simply decided it was $10.99 and that was that.  

What a shame.  If the staff feel that $9.99 is too low a price to charge for everyone and wish to pick and choose to whom and when they wish to charge whatever they want, they could at least make it an actual minimum charge policy or some such, rather than obviously just size you up at the register and decide otherwise.  For $1.00, they just lost regular business."}

{"text":"Feeling for Vegetarian lately as the truth is eating Meat too often does get boring. If you want to find this place, first of all you have to know it even exist. Secondly when you've finally reached the closest intersection you shouldn't be looking for Bhojan Bhandaar but rather \"INDIAN FOOD\" are the 2 words that would lead you to this 7 Days a Week 9:30 am to 9:00 pm Indian Restaurant. 

Walk pass the dining area towards the beautiful display of Sweets at the fridge counter and then look up at the Menu boards to decide your Meal options such as Thali, Manchurian Noodles, Samosa, Roti, Pakora, etc... 

Put in your order as you take a seat watching Indian Channel on the 2 LCDs and realize you're the only non-Indian descent person there waiting or enjoying a good meal. That's usually a good sign though, and this Restaurant is 100% Vegetarian which will attract some with diet restrictions. 

The nice gentlemen called me up to pickup my Thali(3 Veg, Salad, Rice, Naan, Sweet, $6.99). Be careful the plate is hot as you bring it to your table. Fluffy Basmati, Pickled Carrots/Lemon on Onion/Lettuce Salad served with my selection of Mains. 

Eggplant/Potato item, Spinach item, Paneer item and some sort of Sweeten Pumpkin item as Dessert. All were good flavours where I enjoy the Spinach the most while the Paneer Sauce was good for dipping the Naan which was freshly made however it was slightly oily. 

Fyi, they have Jarritos beverages here aside from standards like Mango Lassi, Masala Tea, etc..."}
{"text":"Although the price of the buffet was reasonable, the food quality was slightly above average.  I was specifically disappointed with the quality of the naan which tasted more like Italian focaccia than Indian bread. The best dishes for me were the eggplant, the fish pakoras, and butter chicken. The tandoori chicken was very disappointing.  I also wish that the curry meat dishes didn't contain bones.  Overall a satisfactory experience but then again there isn't much competition in this area."}
{"text":"Just driving around with some hunger pangs and saw this place so slammed into the parking lot and decided to try it

This is a buffet place that has decent choices.  The typical curries - butter chicken, biryani plus some noodles, potatoes and samosas.  They also have a sweets section at the front of the restaurant 

It's a pretty big place - at least hold 50 people and it looks fairly upscale - dark tables and chairs, nice chandeliers etc.  

Overall the food was ok - buffets i find are never exceptional imo as food is cooked in large batches and sit in those warmer trays.  But everything I had was good.  I didn't like how they did their naan - a little more thicker  and dense than i am accustomed to.

2 people including drinks and taxes was about $34 - not bad."}
{"text":"I won't give any star , horrible food. It's a waste of money. Went today n food was horrible. They don't know how to make naan bread."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and I'm beyond happy! The food is simply delicious! Everything is very fresh and tastes like homemade food. Great service as well.
It's my new favourite lunch spot now!"}
{"text":"Had the buffet at lunch. Plenty of choices. Chicken curry was tasty as was the curry goat. Butter chicken was way too sweet. Vegetarian choice were tasty too. I'm not a fan of Indian sweets but there's  an assortment of ice creams to make up for it. Overall good value.

Washrooms could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and wide variety during the buffet. I'm pretty sure it was about 12$ for lunch and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, very casual and laid back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. This is a family owned restaurant that makes authentic Indian cuisine.

Buffet:
There are three sections to the buffet. There is a vegetarian area which has some of the yummiest foods. My favourite is the samosa & home made sauce and their butter sauce on anything ..... mmmmmmmmmmmm  The second section is for chicken and goat. They have a real nice butter chicken with that once again amazing sauce. The other section is the desert and salad area.  Always fresh food is placed there. It comes with a freshly made Naan.

Order: My favourite thing to order is a Thali - done right there for you fresh and hot

Deserts: They also have Indian deserts in another section to bring home ... oooohhh so sweet!

Beware! some of the food can be quite hot for those who are not use to it.  If YOU LOVE HEAT ... ENJOY as it is flavorful as well as hot on SOME OF THE FOODS ... not all ... those that can't handle heat - there is plenty to eat."}
{"text":"AYCE Indian buffet in Woodbridge...how exciting! Based on the recommendation of a friend, 4 of us ventured down expecting to be \"wowed\". I was anything but.   

Decent vegetarian dishes, pretty awful meat dishes.

We visited Bhojan on a Friday night at 7:15. When we walked in it was fairly quiet (perhaps 3 other tables). By the time we left, the place was packed and hopping.

While the vegetarian dishes were amazing (Channa, biryani rice, eggplant, etc) the meat dishes fell way short of other Indian restaurants. The butter chicken was very fatty and the sauce was lacking the full flavours this dish is known for. The Tandorri chicken was just as bad...very fatty pieces with little to no meat on them. One person in our group had the curried goat and said is was excellent, but I can't confirm this myself as I don't like goat. Pekoras were dry and had no flavour at all, the chicken samosas were just as bad. 

Their naan bread is perhaps the worst I've ever had while dining out. It was more like pita and I found it gummy (it looked and tasted store bought). Huge disappointment, as I love to dip naan in the sauces of some of the dishes.....but I didn't here.

Dessert selection was limited to cantaloupe, pineapple, ice cream (that looked disgusting) and a few traditional Indian sweets.

Our Waiter was attentive and all the staff we encountered were friendly.

Dinner for 4, including 2 pops and tax came to $53. 

Would I go back? If in the area I might, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent value.  

This place was recently renovated and its now an all you can eat buffet.  However, you can still get containers to go.  Although they now serve meat , the vegetarian selection is still quite large. The food here is really good and the staff are very friendly. I love this place."}
{"text":"Spicy! Has a nice wide selection of foods split up between vegi and non vegetarian options. Also has a nice dessert section as well. Location seems a little sparse, like a high-school cafeteria but the food itself is well prepared and they were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food was just all right. We got the buffet on a Monday. Food didn't seem that fresh. Naan was excellent only because we were the only ones there and they made it fresh for us. Service was fast too..for the same reason..."}
