{"text":"I haven't been to a Chinese buffet for quite some time, I don't think this place is any worse or better than any other Chinese buffet.  Decent selection of food, though a few items looked overcooked (too bad they were the potstickers).  Very nice staff.  Not sure why so many people think this place is bad, unless they've cleaned up the place recently.  I personally don't expect to be 'wowed' at a Chinese buffet, just want good food at a good price.  Will go back again, once I learn to not go overboard."}
{"text":"I am not one to frequent buffets but find myself making return visits on occasion. Nothing fancy inside but the wait staff is very attentive and the food abundant. Nice offering of Asian food... Salad bar... and also desserts. There should be something for everyone to find that they will like."}
{"text":"This place was clean and nice inside. This is the only thing going for it. The food was low grade and service was worse. I will spare all details you can decide for yourself."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have eaten chinese food ever! The staff was rude and we got directed to a dirty table with dirty silverware. We continued to the buffet where we dished our lunch portion. There was a nice variety of stuff, but the food was very buttery and greasy looking. The flavors were overwhelmed by the use of oil, salt and soy sauce.   The worst of all happened about an hour later when my entire family  complained about stomach cramps followed by a traffic jam in front of the bathroom door. Thanks for an awful experience. By the way, we gave these folks two chances and they blew it!"}
{"text":"The price is right but the food isn't anything to write home about. We stopped going there about two years ago"}
{"text":"we had dinner here, around $9.75 each  The place was clean, buffet was ok. It was cheap dinner.  The meat was weird, the green tea was tasteless, the rice was dry and old. Sushi was good and cold, cake was good. Standard Chinese  buffet  sure will go back again, despite the bad things."}
{"text":"This was not my type of place. It was busy. The buffet route is HORRIBLY FLAWED. The food is not really that good and I'll eat about any kind of Chinese Food you put in front of me.  There was one good chicken thing that wasn't labeled, so I can't even tell you what it was."}
{"text":"Eh. If you go during busy hours (12pm-1ish), the food is quite good. Honey chicken and chicken w/ broccoli are musts. General tso's is meh. Sweet n sour chicken is okay. The staff seems frazzled constantly, but are usually pretty attentive. The price is right, but the restaurant itself is just hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place is awful!  Cold, old, and so SALTY!  I know it's a buffet but have a little bit of quality and a hint of passion for yoyr food and it would taste 10x better. NEVER GO HERE"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place and I decided to ignore the reviews. Well let's just say I'm an idiot and I should of believed in them.  I wanted sushi mainly and I looked on the Internet to see what their buffet consisted of...no info... The sushi display was I believe 4 pieces of California roll and that was it for our entire 1hr visit.  They had the usual Chinese offerings and the food was okay. The offerings were very minimal so don't come thinking it's your typical large buffet.  The price I guess is reflective of the limited items, $9.75 Please take my review advice and spend your money elsewhere. At the moment my stomach is churning and I'm hoping I don't get sick tonight."}
{"text":"I went to Wai Wai with my boss yesterday. The service from our waitress was so-so, and it wasn't too terribly busy for lunch hour (we walked in at 12:15 p.m).   The food was decent; I liked the steak and onions and I liked the fried rice, but nothing stuck out as particularly bad or good. I think the lunch price was around $7, which isn't bad at all.   For this price point, I wasn't thrilled, but I wasn't appalled. There was a pretty good selection of your Chinese-American staples, and, for a buffet, the food was warm.  Like I said, nothing really stuck out as being good or bad. I'd give Wai Wai another shot because of the price point and variety. Just don't expect gourmet five-star dining."}
{"text":"Not very good at all. There are many other, better choices in Canonsburg and McMurray."}
{"text":"The place is okay if you are looking for some very cheap Chinese food.  But, be prepared to eat very cheap Chinese food!   The chicken is obviously low quality.    In many cases, the chicken lacked any sauce at all.  The plates were dirty.     On the bright side, the waitress was friendly and attentive.   And, the lunch price was very affordable."}
{"text":"We like to call this place Wai Wai Did I Go There? LOL! All I can say is believe the Yelp reviews!! The majority of the reviews are 1-2 stars and the reviews are accurate! If someone finds a good Chinese place in Washington, please let me know!! But Wai Wai is NOT it!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the first time. The buffet looked good but I wasn't really crazy about any of the food. And I like Chinese food. I felt like it just tasted \"off,\" but my boyfriend loved it so maybe it's just me. Reasonably priced and staff seems hardworking."}
{"text":"Must have been a competitor who posted oor review because this place is excellent. Great tasting, quality food, lots of choices and selection,  Beautiful atmosphere and restaurant, and very nice hosts and service.  I would highly recommend this place for lunch which is when I enjoyed the buffet."}
{"text":"Not a huge buffet, but all i need to overeat all that i can!  Everything i had was good.  $6.95 for lunch can't be beat."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place quite a few times.  I went in a bit earlier than usual one day.  It was 11:15 and the place had pretty much just opened.  I was appalled to realize that they were serving the food from the night before.  The chicken had discoloration and the friend wonton's were saturated with grease because they were re-heated.  The whole thing was so obvious that when I took the manager over to show her what the food looked like and that I had suspected that they put out leftovers...she looked me in the eye...and said she was sorry.  So it wasn't an accident.  This is their policy.  So if you go to this place for lunch...be careful that you aren't getting dinner from the night before.  I WON'T BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!"}
