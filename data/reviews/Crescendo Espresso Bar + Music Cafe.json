{"text":"Great local coffee shop.  Friendly staff, great coffee and amazing scones.  Will definitely make it a stop the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, and a cozy seating area. (I'm a sucker for the comfy chairs near a fireplace set-up). Staff was friendly and I enjoyed the decor and the vibe. I did buy a day-old muffin that was plainly awful. I know, it is expressly advertised as \"old\", so I'm not expecting \"fresh-out-of-the-oven\", but I do hope for \"better-than-a-stale-packaged-baked-good-from-the-grocery-store\". Overall, it's a great neighborhood spot, and I wanted to go back after I left."}
{"text":"Only had the iced coffee and won't get it again. They fill half the cup with water and then put a \"concentrated\" coffee in it. Not good, tastes watered down and bitter. Brewed coffee is on the only way to go for iced coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing nitro coffee - even in the winter, I'll order it!  Best mocha & hot chocolate (according to my nieces) amazing GF avocado toast. Love the music, love the vibe and the great staff.  Always a stop for me on Monroe Street!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in Madison. Their espresso drinks are sometimes hit-or-miss, but they more than make up for it with their amazing Nitro Brew coffee and their pour-overs with Anodyne coffee; I've never been disappointed with either. It's also a great cozy spot to study, and the staff has always been helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. It's got a great vibe with great people who work there. It's also got that X factor that makes a place great. Trust me, this place is something special."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in town.
Cait and Paul are humble and warm business owners that are always improving the atmosphere of their shop. They love Madison, its music scene, and good coffee. They serve Anodyne, one of Wisconsin's finest roasters; and recently even started serving their cold brew coffee in single serve bottles and on tap (yes, on tap). Great place to study, meet with friends, or take in a show."}
{"text":"Loved my recommendation from the very friendly staff! had the Miele Latte which is a delicious Honey Cinnamon LatteI also loved the Tree Hugger bfast sandwhich...pesto veggie egg fast on an English Muffin!!!! Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Great espresso and coffee right across from Trader Joe's! They use locally roasted coffees and prepare it correctly.

I had a great double espresso with perfect crema, followed by an expertly prepared pour-over. It's rare to find a cafe that does either of these perfectly, so I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is apparently very well trained and seemed happy to be working.

About me: I've roasted coffee at home for the last 7 years and own two professional espresso machines along with two pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can prepare coffee on par with what I make at home. In fact, I've only ever found a handful that can--Crescendo is one of them!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Madison.  The Nitro Cold Press and Avocado toast are my go-to picks- I would get them everyday if I could. The staff are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Have tried the nitro cold press coffee- creamy and delicious! The peanut butter granola toast is definitely enough to share, try it topped with salt and jam from the add-in area. Service has been extremely welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you are one of those people who needs to be seen in the 'right' place, eating and drinking the 'right' things, by the 'right' people. No depth and predictable environment and menu. No style."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of my favorite coffee shops in town. Every time I come here the service is friendly, and the coffee is top-notch.

What's more, they just became the first shop in Madison to serve nitrogen coffee, which if you haven't tried it...just try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a coffee after a meeting on Monroe street. I ordered an Americano for here and it was served in a cute little blue cup...hot...with a perfect shot of espresso. The baristas were friendly, the shop was filled with people and the tables were clean. What more can you ask for when needing to get some work done? I would say it was somewhat on the noisy side, but nothing that kept me from concentrating. They have live music regularly and different artists are featured on their walls regularly. If on Monroe street and in the mood to support local coffee, check this place out!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Fireplace!!!!   Staff is always up for a laugh.  I am not a coffee drinker but I do enjoy the iced tea.  My children and I absolutely LOVE the Tree Huggers!!!!  They are always asking for Tree Huggers as a reward.  Heck, If I can get the cat box scooped it is a great deal!   The Tree Huggers are egg sandwiches with pesto, cheese, spinach and tomato.   They were even kind enough to let me interview for employees before my store was open.  Odd request but Cait was up for it and it actually turned into a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and attentive. Coffee was good. Sitting by the window on a snowy day was cold. I wished they had the fireplace running. Very popular joint!"}
{"text":"Realistically this is all I need in a local coffee shop. A rotating display of art work on the walls, great music playing in the background, mismatched plates & mugs, sunshine streaming in through the windows, the opportunity to catch some local bands or author readings.  And of course, great coffee.  I don't need to buy a mug with a company logo on it or some schmaltzy last minute gift that screams \"I didn't try.  At all.\"  Looking forward to many return visits with laptop in tow & pretending to be working while what I'm most likely doing is running background checks on potential dates."}
{"text":"Initially went as a friend of mine was performing and was blown away with the atmosphere. I am not really a coffee aficionado but I can honestly I had one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had. They know there stuff. The owners really take pride in this place and made it their own. It feels like you are part of the family when you are there. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is consistently the best coffee in Madison. They make awesome toast and lattes and the service is always awesome. We love the wife-husband duo that owns this place and you should absolutely go here if you're in Madison and looking for coffee/espresso!"}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for a few weeks now and this has become my favorite coffee shop. The coffee is delicious; I especially love their nitro cold press coffee! I have yet to try much from their food menu. I had an avocado toast a few visits ago and it was good. They always have great music playing over the speakers and I'd definitely love to go to one of their concerts. I love bringing my laptop when things are a little quieter to write and sip coffee. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and friendly, accommodating staff. I've been here 3 times now. Tried the Little Red Roaster blend and it was intense! Tasty stuff. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. They opened early on a Sunday due to early am ticket sales at a neighboring shop, which was much appreciated by those of us waiting in line. Thanks Crescendo!"}
{"text":"Barista was super friendly and helpful.  She explained the coffees and answered all my questions.  The coffee was great and so was the cranberry cookie. Good place to relax and people watch."}
{"text":"I booked the Crescendo Mobile Coffee Cart for a recent grand opening for my company. It was a chilly, fall day and they provided a great element to the event. People loved being able to order fun coffee drinks, and I was even able to pick two specialty drinks - Maple Cinnamon Latte and Caramel Apple Cider, both were a huge hit! 

Cait and Roxanne were so great to work with. Both were kind, outgoing, and very friendly with all the guests. 

I would for sure check out the brick & mortar store and I would love to work with them again for future events. A really fun and unique element for any event."}
{"text":"Get the Mocha Blended thing, amazing! This place is also great to keep an eye on for live music, which they feature pretty regularly. Cozy little setup, owners are always there, good conversation, great Frappes."}
{"text":"Yes, I tried the avocado toast. And yes, it was fantastic. I also shared a breakfast muffin called \"The Treehugger\", and it was pesto perfection. We were there a few hours, and shared a chicken burrito before we left. I'm not sure that the burritos are house-made, because it seemed like a frozen burrito. Either way, it was a good burrito and I'd order it again. It came with salsa and cost only like $5.

They offer pour-over coffee here, and it's great. The almond milk chai latte I ordered was delicious, and I gladly ordered another before leaving.

The place cozy and nice, but I did find it a little cold in there yesterday.

The owners and staff at Crescendo are fantastic and do a great job.

The place was clean, even the bathrooms. The music playing was a nice mix of low-key tunes. Everyone there just seemed really relaxed and happy.

Jut a really nice coffee spot with good vibes. Loved it, and will definitely add it to my weekend coffee shop rotation."}
{"text":"Had the tree hugger on a Gotham honey oat whole wheat bagel, and it was fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!  They also have Cha Cha tea there, local to madison, and make the Celebration Iced Tea for everyone which is a favorite of mine!  They also carry Anodyne Coffee from Milwaukee, which is one of my favorite coffee roasters, and have cold brew on nitro.  I had a drink recommended to me that I can't get over, it's called the After-School Special.  It's chocolate milk and nitro cold brew coffee.  It was so creamy and delicious!!!  I wanted like 3 more... lol.  Great ambiance, friendly baristas, good food, and delicious beverages!  Plus they have live music there!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite coffee shop in town. The coffee is quite good and the price is on point (I tried the espresso and cappuccino). The place is very welcoming and during the winter it's awesome to seat by the fireplace. I also like their food selection. Simple basic items that are good for breakfast at very reasonable prices. I have tried their avocado toast (I recommend it spicy) and it was nice. I haven't tried their burritos, but I will. They look small but tasty. My only complaint is that sometimes they forget to make your coffee, so you might have to remind them. I heard they have music sometimes, but you have to pay admission."}
{"text":"On a cross-country trip, we stopped at a Trader Joe's across the street to stock up on food. We needed good coffee. Spouse went to this place, which was across the street, and got us 2 cups. Hands down, it was the best cup of coffee I had in the 19 states we visited on this trip. I wish I lived in Madison. :("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Tasty treats!  Yummy coffee---iced mocha!"}
{"text":"Well, it's official I'm in love. I came here last night for a bluegrass concert and left with a new favorite coffee shop. So many different options of food and drink and a friendly and fun environment.

In terms of the music: excellent sound for a small space. Great amount of seating. Loved the concert experience.

As for food and drink: we tried the honey toast which was delicious. I hear they have an awesome
chorizo burrito as well! I did not get any coffee but I heard rave reviews from my concert neighbors and the baristas were quite friendly."}
{"text":"A friendly staff and atmosphere that are serious about their support of local musical artists.  This was my first visit to Crescendo.  The patrons were most respectful, courteous, and very responsive to the performers, who were each well versed in their craft, from novice performers to pros.  I like the fact that there was never any pressure on buying drinks or snacks.  I look forward to returning  with friends and fellow musicians."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in here a few weeks ago and LOVED it -- great drinks (@blueberrymatcha) great nitro, great prices, and really awesome baristas! We had some good conversations and delicious food, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"Came here while girlfriend was working during the weekend. Had a latte both times with sugar-free hazelnut syrup. It was delicious, and baristas were very friendly. I was able to get a lot of work done here next to their fireplace, which was a great touch to the relaxing and calm atmosphere. While the place was pretty crowded on the weekend, it was quiet as well, which was nice to see. I definitely want to return to try the Avocado toast or one of their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous coffee shop that also serves wine, beer and food. Highly recommend the flatbread with goat cheese, olives and avocado. All the ingredients were so fresh! They brew Anodyne coffee which is one of my favorites - if you are looking for a perfectly and expertly brewed cup of high quality coffee, this is a great place to go. They also support the local music scene and are operating as a venue for acoustic acts. I saw a show here recently and it was amazing. The sound is great and the band was awesome and a perfect fit for this venue. In short, highly recommend this place whether you're looking for coffee in the afternoon or a drink and some good music at night. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful as well. Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"I've been to Crescendo a couple times for meetings through the years and nothing too memorable comes to mind to review. Having been there at night for the first time to attend a ticketed music event, I'll call this a 5 star establishment! I've never bought online tickets for a local music event before  and wondered what kind of mess there would be getting in, about how organized or not things would be. The door person efficiently found the order on a printed list and easy as that, we were in. Seating was intimate and easy to get. The coffee drinkers among us enjoyed what they had (sorry, don't drink coffee and can't recall the specifics), the tween was happy with her hot chocolate with arty heart design, and I had a pleasant blueberry green tea. I like that there are adult beverages available so there are choices for those feeling that vibe. Would like more food options or specials but being seated right in front of the musicians we were okay to go without food this time. But without the show more food options might get us in here as regulars. In conclusion, top notch place to hear and see intimate music performances. Keep it going!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time and I was super impressed. First, major props to them for serving Anodyne Coffee out of Milwaukee.  I think it is one of the best roasters in the state.  Second, the staff is super friendly and helpful.  Finally, they have cold press coffee on nitro.  As this is my go-to summer drink, I am stoked.  The nitro makes it extra smooth and gives it a nice head ala beer.  Since I live close by, this will quickly become my go to cafe."}
{"text":"Best iced coffee in Madison, probably in Wisconsin, possibly on planet Earth. They recently put it on a nitro tap which makes it even better. Get an iced coffee and a peanut butter granola toast and you'll feel like you've died and gone to heaven."}
{"text":"After a change of hands, this cafe spot on Monroe Street has transitioned to the perfect place to learn more about coffee, listen to some live music and enjoy the company of neighbors and friends.

The owners are enthusiastic about music + coffee and they really show it! A new, custom made pour-over station ensures you get a cup of the best quality and learn something new while you're at it! Some alterations to the front of the shop let more light in for a fresh, relaxing spot to do what you need to do while you caffeinate.

If it's a little too late for java, there are wine and beer options, too! Hungry? The flatbread is delicious!"}
{"text":"I was only at Crescendo for a short meeting but I loved my time there. First and foremost was the fact that the staff just radiated happiness. I felt super welcome and like they wanted me there - not always the case in a cafe. 

When ordering I inquired about herbal iced tea and the barista was happy to check for me and then describe the flavor. It was quite tasty and refreshing and a nice alternative to hot tea or hot chocolate. 

The vibe of the shop is homey and there's a good amount of natural light. Seating is somewhat limited but comfortable. I definitely will be back for future meetings or to mix up my workspace for an afternoon. I've got to try that avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Great place, love the fireplace on a cold day, and the coffee is excellent.

I don't like that some of the baked goods are sealed in plastic."}
{"text":"Kick back with a book, a soy latte, and a Silly Yak gluten free vegan chocolate raspberry muffin (if you have the weirdest diet but love all of the delicious). A Monroe street gem of a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Quick visit on a rainy Friday. I will be back! 

Ordered a dirty chai, had some questions that were answered efficiently and politely. Then decided on an Oat Date Scone - delicious! I was going to wait until later to eat, but it was super good.

My latte came out with creamy foam, drinkable temperature and adorable (but not too elaborate) latte art.

What you will run into...skinny young moms wearing white skinny jeans and denim buttondowns toting around chunky alabaster babies with glitter bows glued to their bald heads. Alas, this still is Madison."}
{"text":"Iced Caramel Lattes and Avocado Toast were the perfect way to start the day after a long wedding weekend! Delicious and super cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Crescendo has always had a special place in my heart. I've been going to Crescendo three times a week for two years. I used to work at Trader Joe's next door to Crescendo and I would usually go to there to buy coffee or toast. The coffee is amazing and the toast is amazing at such an affordable price. I remember I would use to go to Crescendo very early in the morning before heading out to class, and I would get recognized by the employees since I used to go there frequently. Currently I moved to Santa Barbara, CA and I miss coming here. I've made some good memories here and I'm proud to been able to have good memories here. Cheers to the store and I'll be back some day."}
{"text":"So, first, the good.

The coffee. Is. GOOD. On par with Victory on Atwood, my very favorite in town. Anodyne, first time I've had it, and I ordered it pourover, Ethiopian. Really, really, really good. You can choose any of the beans they have, not just the daily choices, so that's cool.

The signage. They've probably used someone like Planet Propaganda to design their logo and corporate ID, and it's good.

And now, the rest. 

Prices. 

$5.00 for a Chemex brew? That's nuts. At Victory it's in the $3 range. A pourover here is $2.75, also a bit high. They list 'creative add ins' for your coffee, and they want .65 to add honey. What?? There's honey on the homey, heavy wood 

Sideboard stand.

behind you to add in, for free. In a big squeeze bottle, with one inch of hardened honey in the bottom. Good luck getting that out. There's also one stainless steel dispenser, unlabeled, which you assume is cream. It has about a teaspoon of liquid in it. You pour it in, and when you give them the container to refill, they tell you it was skim milk. Ugh. They insist that it *is* labeled. You look again, and sure enough, once upon a time, someone wrote 'skim' on it, in Sharpie, which is 90% scratched off now.

Seating.

The place was pretty full on a Saturday morning (11/1/14). No table seating was available. Much has been made of their fireplace, which has exactly one chair next to it. With a big hole ripped in the arm. That was the only seat, so I took it. 

Outlets.

None visible. Wifi requires a password, which is not apparent until you try to log in. Another patron supplied it to me.

Service.

Harried, unsmiling, no greeting. The staff seems stressed and unhappy. I just don't see why it's so hard to look up, say hi, and smile when a customer comes through the door. You need to set the mood, welcome and acknowledge people, then the wait isn't such a big deal. Their go-to move seems to be to apologize once someone finally reaches the counter. They apologized to everyone. 

Cleanliness.

Not so good. Borderline grimy. The self service containers, dispensers, floors. The armchair next to me has spilled coffee that has dripped down and dried all over the side. Ugh. The massively bearded dude making the food behind the counter wore gloves, occasionally.

Summary...

I'll try them again in the evening sometime for music and wine. I have a feeling that's where their heart lies, and that's cool. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for coffee or food again, although the coffee was well prepared. That's the best thing I can say. I hovered between two and three stars, but the coffee decided it. Everything else honestly needs help."}
{"text":"This a great venue for music and they have a extensive list of performing acts that come through. I stopped in during the Caffeine Crawl event to try their nitro coffee. Yes, I said NITRO COFFEE! Drop everything you are doing and go try their nitro coffee. Oh, yeah, they have nitro sangria right now too. I did not get to try that, but I will be back! The place is super casual and laid back. I great place to meet up with friends and hang out. They then added dark chocolate, mint bitters and cream to the nitro coffee. Ummmm... that combo is amazeballs! Not sweet, but tasted just like a grown up mint patty."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a simple breakfast, read the paper and hang out. Kid friendly. Small menu but includes the usual cafe options like muffins, bagels, granola, avocado toast, breakfast sandwiches plus a few burritos and full espresso menu. Mostly 2-seater tables but a few 4-seaters. Cozy fireplace. Staff are always kind. Also a performance spot at night for local musicians and poets and writers."}
{"text":"This just in: Avocado Toast is a 2015 food trend to watch.
Where did I learn of this? 
Time Magazine aka a really reputable source for trending foods across the land. 
You know who's been serving Avocado Toast for like, ever? 
Crescendo. Which means two things:

1. Crescendo Espresso Bar is a trendsetter. 
2. They're more reputable than Time magazine because they've been putting avocado on toast for longer. 

In all seriousness though is is probably my favorite food item if I'm sitting down for a wealth of work. Something about my favorite mashed up fruit on a warm piece of thick cut toast just really gets this guy going. It's creamy and toasty and barely fits in your mouth the way they cut the bread, AND if you're looking to heat things up, they'll sprinkle a little cayenne pepper and add a few drops of hot sauce. 

Also important to point out is the fact that the beautiful work-worked pour over station they use on site can come home with you! Well, not THAT one, but a different pour over stand. Cait's dad Joe made several for holiday gifting, so pop in and check out all the options. And if you're reading this after the holidays, the stands would still make a stellar gift for a birthday, graduation, father's day, boxing day if you're Canadian... the list goes on. 

And the last little tidbit I'd like to leave here is Crescendo joins the ranks of only a half dozen places where you can purchase Yes coffee, a new roaster out in Monroe Wisconsin that makes a pretty mean bean. They have a decaf that in my opinion trumps their caffeinated varieties, which I understand is do in part to the careful work done by one of the owners who can't consume caffeine. That little hiccup makes the decaf roasting process all the more important for him and all the more delicious for you!"}
{"text":"Crescendo is one of my new favorite spots for a few important reasons:

1) AVOCADO TOAST. It's giant! and delicious...AND you can ask them to give it a kick with some cayenne. The bread is luxuriously thick and tasty. I've heard the breakfast sandwiches are good too, but I haven't been able to try anything else since having the avocado toast.

2) Great coffee. I've stopped in here many times over the past year or two to grab a cup of coffee. Their coffee and espresso drinks are awesome, and they have many tea options. They also offer a bottomless coffee option. Warning to those who don't like sweet chai mixes, they use the pre-sweetened Tazo chai mix for chai lattes. However, they do also make a chai latte from tea bags, which is unsweetened.

3) Nice work environment. This is something I've recently discovered. There are lots of tables and outlets, the music is low key and conducive to doing work, and most of the people there are working or reading or doing other quiet activities.

Whether you're just stopping by to grab coffee on the way to somewhere else or have a day of work planned, I recommend checking out Crescendo!"}
{"text":"What a nice little coffee shop, which is just so surprising to find here in Madison.  I'm being facetious.  This place has a nice view with big sunny front windows so I can see the Madison Police about to tow my car.  Important information, there is no parking at the meters across the street from 1600 to 1730 but free street parking right around the corner. I was a bit leery when the Chief of Staff selected this place as a choice to get work done as it's named \"Crescendo\" so I fully expected an increasing loudness that turned out to not be the case. Truthfully, this place should be called, Decrescendo as it got quieter the whole time I was here.  Some musician with eclectic taste chose the music here, I very much enjoyed it.  I guess sometimes they have live music, as my table was up on a little stage.  
   My manly cappuccino was expertly prepared and presented, and the chairs were good for work though a little hard so not great for sitting and reading a good book.  The mid afternoon sun is intense at the window seats.  There's a nice CD and record store across the street, as well as a Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Monroe street area for most of my life, and I think this is one of my favorite coffee shops. I adore the aroma of coffee filling my lungs when I walk through the door.  I love how the coffee tastes, and the espresso they use is phenomenal. 

In addition, the staff is extremely friendly. They offer great advice to help you order the right coffee or tea. The location as well is wonderful. There is a bunch of natural light from the front of the building."}
{"text":"Talk about a cool local coffee spot in Madison. How did it take me 4 years to find this place?

I stopped for breakfast to go on the way to work one morning. It was early-ish (7am), but there were still a few tables of people hanging out and working. 

I was extremely excited about their avocado toast on the menu (the only place it exists in Madison?), but ended up opting for the black bean breakfast burrito due to logistics of avocado toast in a to-go container. The burrito was pretty good!

I also got a large black iced tea and it also didn't disappointment. Crisp and refreshing, with plenty of caffeine to start my morning.

The interior is clean and nicely designed. Based on the flyers on the wall, there seems to be a lot of events and live music (it is a music cafe after all).

I'll be back soon, but next time I'll try to time it so that I can enjoy my items in the cafe, and I will DEFINITELY be ordering the avocado toast."}
{"text":"Really love their avacado toast. Comes on a nice thick piece of bread. Also can't get enough of their cold-brewed coffee. It comes out if a tap and is super creamy and very flavorful.

They did have to raise their price of the cold-brewed coffee. I don't remember the actual price but it was pretty expensive for a medium. Because I don't live close and Monroe Street can be trick to navigate I don't come here as often anymore unless I'm in the area. But it is definitely worth it if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"avocado. Fucking. TOAST!!! (Read in a crescendo)

Solid spot for studying and right across the street from my bf (Trader Joe's). Only downside is, because of its location on Monroe, it gets a lot of foot traffic and can get pretty noisy.

I've yet to come here for their musical events, but that seems to be their gig based off their name. Will have to check out a performance one of these days."}
{"text":"The best cold brew in Madison! 

Also a shot-out to Erin, the kindest barrista who will always greet you with a big smile."}
{"text":"This cafe has become a part of our (perhaps overly) regularly routined lives.  Being in grad. school, we spend a lot of time reading and don't have much money.  Since we don't have much money we shop at Trader Joe's and go out for coffee and read for a few hours at Crescendo.  The space is cozy, which is great for the winter and terrible for trying to get to the bathroom.  They have solid food options, including Gotham's bagels.  I've never been disappointed by the staff or the coffee...though one time I did have 1 cup too many."}
