{"text":"This place is still awful and the managers I routinely encounter are still rude beyond belief. Still waiting for a good experience. I don't come here for pleasure, but for work meetings. I am far happier keeping my business across the street at The Lucky Penny as opposed to a place where I may as well be garbage."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a great team.   The best kept secret here is the $5.50 mega bagel; any bagel, unlimited toppings. If you need a daily lunch option that's filling but affordable, this is your best bet.   If you're ready to drop a few more dollars, the soup/sandwich/salad combos are all quite good. The sandwiches are adjusted to include seasonal ingredients.  Only complaint is that small items like croissants, as delicious as they are, seem a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this coffee shop in a beautiful old high school. Situated between classroom floors in a stairwell foyer. Service was quick - we ordered coffees (pour over, latte). Delicious. We sat at the bar by the window and had the best seats in the house for white squirrel watching. He was jumping around a chestnut tree across the street. After coffee we really enjoyed visiting each floor of the Artscape building to view art displays in the hallways. Then a visit to the gallery to cap off an excellent experience."}
{"text":"The service is pleasant. But slow, ordering a bagel or breakfast sandwich is a 15 minute affair. They used to make your lunch sandwiches made to order but that too much time. Now they're made the morning before and sit in a fridge getting stale. They always run out of food when you're hungry it seems too. Price is a bit exorbitant when you get a tiny stale sandwich.   Yes they use local, organic, (fill in new hip food trend) but it's not worth it at these prices when there's a cheap Portuguese bakery across the street that does it better.   Coffee is decent, muffins are decently priced. So use this place for a coffee and muffin. That's it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious and service was great. They were very willing to share information and recommend things for me. A bit pricey but the fresh ingredients and quality is what you are paying for. Neat concept about the whole place as it used to be a school and was remodelled to be a neat art dwelling for appreciators and artists alike!"}
