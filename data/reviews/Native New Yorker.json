{"text":"Did not like the pizza puffs or the garlic bread. Too much cheese in the puffs and the bread was bland.  Prices are average as well as the service. Not worth a try... foodwise"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch last Sunday while in town. I ordered 20 wings medium and wife had Club Sandwich. The wings were pretty hot for medium, way hotter than the menu let on. But, even though hotter then I would like, the wings were really good (the chicken part of the wing vs the sauce). Wife said the Club was \"Just OK\". Had a side order of Tater Tots which were pretty good. Next time will try the salt-n-pepper"}
{"text":"Sorry to burst your bubble but this is a chain restaurant. I am from NY and I  have ate at Native New Yorker, and there food tastes nothing like NYC food at all. If your looking for real NY food usually the Mom & Pop Italian Restaurants are the best."}
{"text":"Terrible! We went during the day so maybe it's different at night. There was one person working. She was good considering we didn't see her much. Not her fault. The food was terrible.   I assumed ( I know) that this would be an Italian restaurant. No. They serve Italian style food, but is far from an Italian restaurant at kitchen or heart.     It's like the Italian style version if an Applebee's or Fridays."}
{"text":"First Visit: 'Native new yorker\" is out and \"bar an grill\" is in. It has the same owners, they just defranchised. The \"just enough\" wings are very good. All of the items on the menu look very good and a part of the proceeds from sales of menu items with chicken breasts go to breast cancer awareness. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I cant wait to go back and try different menu items.  Second Visit: Very disappointed! I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and my husband ordered the just enough wings. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out after we ordered and it was empty. The wings tasted like they had been done for some time and were cool in temperature.  My pizza crust was good, however the chicken had a horrible taste to it.  I could not even finish half of the individual size.  Wish the second experience was as good as the first.  Everytime we talk about going back I can't get over the taste of the chicken."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday night and it was definitely slower than it should be.. I really enjoyed my meal!! The waitress was sweet and the place was very clean. This is the only place I go for wings!"}
{"text":"Plenty of good things to say about the staff, the food, and the service, but one area deserves special recognition. I've been coming on Sundays to watch football for over 15 years and I honestly can't remember EVER finding the restrooms dirty. They are ALWAYS clean. That's a tough feat for any restaurant, but with a full bar during NFL games?!....way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Our family travels 6 hours from San Diego once or twice a year...  our major goal while visiting.... get to Native New Yorker.  We have yet to find a Wings Place that comes anywhere near the Native New Yorker!!  (We want a location in San Diego!!!)  The prices keep rising and we wish they wouldn't, but our entire family loves going to Native.  I love being able to purchase two wings of every type.  I love being able to purchase individual beef ribs.... but most of all... The STRAWBERRY WINGS are to die for!!!  How awesome are those?  So what if sometimes the restaurant is a little cluttered... It's a family restraurant and the servers are more interested in getting your food to you than picking up that napkin!  The service is quick and excellent.  TV's keep those who don't want to talk busy, but some of our best conversations have been over Native Wings!!!"}
{"text":"Five of my friends and I stopped at Native last night for Happy Hour. We were trying to keep an open mind about our visit at first.  Our server was young and seemed a little inexperienced for the amount of tables she had. She wasn't very friendly...didn't add to the experience.  When were first came in we asked her what was in one of their signature drinks, she had no clue nor did she ask anyone. After we all ordered and she was gone we found it in another menu...oh, that sounds good. I probably would have got that.  Oh well, first strike.  Most of us were not that hungry so really we should have been a pretty low maintenance table. We ask for second round, chips and salsa and some wings.  She comes back five min later with the wrong drink.  Comes back with a new one Stella on tap. Still no chips and salsa. We are watching our buddys beer and the \"head\" on this thing keeps growing and growing. We were making fun of it. Our other buddy orders his second Stella same thing, they said it tasted weird. I make a joke to the waitress about their strange beer and she says \"yea, well no one ever orders that so...\" \"So, what I say, they have old chunky beer?\" She disappears again.  We are going on 30 min here...still no wings...still no chips and salsa. Were snag her in passive and asked about the wings. You could tell by her face she never put the order in.  We talked to a manager who seemed pretty uninterested in talking with us. Of coarse the comp'd items off the bill which we didn't even care. We just wanted to feel like they actually cared about the service we received, they did not.  Me giving a 2 rather than a one is simply out of kindness... We saw that the management set our waitress up for failure, so I took it easy. They really earned a 1."}
{"text":"I usually just order my food to go here. Small seating area and waitresses and rude and slow."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Took over 30 min for food to arrive. Ordered chef salad. Made with processed turkey and ham. Also with processed cheese slices. childs choc milk was not mixed up. Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu.  Won't come back again."}
{"text":"Good wings, excellent pizza and decent happy hour beer prices.  We go once a week (45 cent wings Tues & Thur).  Burgers, fish n chips are also good.  Also try their BACON SUNDAY...it comes with FRIED BACON on it.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Wings are the best in town. BUT, the thing Ill always remember this location by is the time about a year ago we were finishing eating, was about 10 minutes past closing time, only people there. Dining room was cleaned and ready for the next day. In comes a party of about 10 people, I guess the front door was not locked. Not waiting for a hostess they headed right towards the back room, which had been cleaned and chairs on tables, and sat down. Our waitress apologized to them and said very nicely that the kitchen was closed and they were done for the nite. The guy responds with, exact words, \"its ok, my parents own the place\".  Do I really need to even count how many ways that is wrong? Then he asks the waitress for a comp bill, fills out the order for 10 people and hands it to her to take back the the now closed kitchen. Yes, I have been eating here since day 1 but its too bad after my 200 visits here this is how I remember Native New Yorker on Bell rd. Hopefully the owners care enough to read these reviews and maybe will teach their son something."}
{"text":"This business has closed and Rookies neighborhood sports grill has really done a nice job updating the place and dramatically improving food and service. The owners are local and are always there to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"My family has been spending B-day's at NNY for years, and I wish I could tell you why.  Maybe we're just creatures of habit, because I have been consistently disappointed with their food.  I'm a wing girl, and last nights dry, crusty wings did nothing for me.  The pizza was mediocre...I would have done better to stuff a frozen pizza in my purse and take bites when the waitress wasn't looking.  And I know the economy is bad, but they were doing some real nickel and dimeing.  5 of us ordered 50 wings, and it only came with 4 small cups of ranch.  So, it was a fight to decide who had to share.  Then someone had the brilliant idea to just ask for another cup of ranch.  The waitress warmly replied \"there is an extra charge for that\".  Oh well,  I guess it's my fault if I keep going back."}
{"text":"Seriously I'm glad I don't live in Arizona or I'd weight 400 pounds! I had wings here every Tuesday night for wing night....I was down in Arizona in 2008 and it was my first stop....yeah you heard me...not to see friends who I missed...it was I'm going to Native see you there with my wings and beer....seriously I think I'm drooling while writing this review....I've never had anything else on their menu just the wings....it's all about the wings and beer...lots of wings and beer.....   WINGS AND BEEEEER!!!!!   and I wonder why I gained 20 pounds?!?"}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends from out of town who I havent seen in awhile (I know it was valentines day but we were celebrating being single of course)! We also wanted to watch the olympic ice skating and relax. I showed up late (horrible habit) and found them in the center of the room... apparently they had just ordered so I quickly looked over the menu. 10ish minutes passed by and not a single waiter in sight.. except for the one playing video games so I politely went over and asked if I could order and he said go to the bar and ask (i forget her name) so I went over there and she said she would find my server for me. I said thank you and sat down. 5 minutes later still nothing. 10 minutes later our server does appear with every one else's food! All I wanted was some water and some wings.. Needless to say I finally got my food (honey bbq wings) and was happy but the service..yuck!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while and met two friends for Happy Hour last night.  Food was awful!!  I've never seen DICED onion scattered all over a combination pizza.  Probably frozen from a bag.  At 65 cents each, the wings were the smallest, all tip sections, no or very few drummettes.  The 15 \"traditional\" wings have no sauce, just over-fried, forgotten in the fryer.  Not \"the best of Phoenix classics\" as the menu says.  And they certainly wouldn't have been worth even the 39 cent Tuesday and Thursday special price.   After asking for ranch dressing when we ordered, all we got were 4 tiny cups to go with 30 wings and 3 people!   This wasn't the Native New Yorker food that I remember from a year ago and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am have been coming to native new Yorker since they opened but today the food/wings/service we're horrible the wings there we're so tiny as if the killed a baby chicken the bones were so brittle that it jammed in the side of my mouth the waitress never came back for any refills and to top things off they were not busy.. I am so disappointed with location I specifically requested fresh wings avoid this location 1 star for crappy day here..."}
{"text":"If you have been to a Native before this one is not much different, which can be a good thing. This Native is split pretty much equally into 2 parts - the restaurant and bar, and you can eat and drink in either one. Best day to go is on Tuesday when they have their 25 cent wings special - which remains one of the best in town!! Good pizza and wings and cheap beer make for a fun, friendly hangout, but definitely not a singles hot spot. The reason for the 4 star rating, is that their carryout service is a little lacking - if they say 15 minutes, better be ready for 30. I have wasted a lot of time in that lobby! But the wings are always great!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. The wings are good! I like the skin has that crisp to it.  They serve Blue Moon by the pitcher which is rad when with a group (or alone haha)  The food really is excellent. I used to know a bartender here he was cool.  I would have it 5 stars BUT some of the waitresses are idiots and seem to mess up every single thing you order.  They always correct it for free but it is annoying!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to this restaurant for father's day. We were always happy with the food & service. Today on the way there I looked up reviews of this restaurant & 1 other. To my surprise I found terrible reviews involving a waitress reeking of cigarette smoke when she served their table. My husband told me that everything would be fine so we went to this restaurant anyway. imagine my disgust when I found the end of a plastic cigarette  wrapper in my diet pepsi! I picked it out because it looed like a slice of ice. Our waitress was very sweet and apologetic however management only took off our drinks & 25 percent which I feel is unconcionable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Is it just me or does this place smell???   We stopped for a pitcher (or 2) the other day.  We sat in the bar and the service was pretty good.  The beer seemed flat.  The food always seems like it was frozen and just warmed up in the microwave.  I think they need to revamp this place if they plan on competing with the new places that are opening around it.   Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Decent food. This place needs a better rating."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The pizza (10\" peperoni) was greasy and tasted like something I could have paid $2 @ the grocery store. Never again!"}
{"text":"I love their wings, the pizza is ok, they do have an ok amount of TVs to watch & have little sound boxes you can put on your table so you can hear the TV (assuming the music isn't blaring). Not our favorite sports bar place but we stop in every once in a while."}
{"text":"I love that the Indians are out in Arizona now for Spring Training. It gives me an excuse to get out of Phoenix and travel out to the oasis that is Goodyear. Following up a few hours of people-watching at the Renaissance Fair in Apache Junction, the Kaufmans and I went to the opposite side of the state to check out the Tribe v. the World Champs. We wanted to pre-grub a bit, and saw a sign for Auggies (or Aggies, whatever). Either way, it was a wasted trip. Big sis laid it out in her review, but the place was packed, understaffed, and soon to be forgotten. After being ignored for 10 minutes, we rolled out to Native New Yorker.  That ended up being a great choice. The place was pretty busy, but we walked right in, grabbed a seat at the bar, and were welcomed in about 34 seconds (yes, I timed it). I forget our server's name, but she was pretty fantastic, even after a nameless member of the family dumped a third of her beer on the table. Party foul after 2 minutes? No good, AK! It was ok though, no one else noticed. The place was pretty loud for the UA game, and there were a number of TVs that distracted everyone else from her shame.  Anyways, our girl was on top of things during the whole visit, keeping our Fat Tires full of amber goodness. AK got the chef salad (she's the healthy one), the bro-in-law ordered the buffalo chicken sliders (yes, he IS the spicy one, how did you know?) and I was the difficult one. The Strippers sounded great, basically chicken tenders in your choice of sauce, so I ordered half a pound, half Oriental Garlic and the other half Asiago Parmesan Dusted. All three meals came out pretty quickly, accompanied by more Fat Tire; it just makes everything better....  The food was impressive. AK loved her chef salad, which looked a little out of place on our table, but highly delicious. BK burned through his sliders, and the curly fries satisfied both Kaufmans. My Strippers came out in separate baskets, which was greatly appreciated. The Oriental Garlic was fantastic, a sweet and sour sauce with some bite to it. The garlic wasn't overwhelming, and it was spicier than I was expecting, but in a good way. The Asiago Parm were solid (I did it again, Amy!:) ); the dusting was tasty but not very strong.  All in all, the experience was very satisfactory. It would have been nice to hit a happy hour, but it was well worth the stop. Also, as an ASU alum/employee, I got to watch UA lose, which is always fun. If you are ever out west in Goodyear, definitely make a drop-by."}
{"text":"My wife and I always heard good things about this place.  We were wanting to go to Tagliani's, but thought we should try Native New Yorker for once, to see what the hype was about.  We were sat quickly and the lady seemed pretty nice.  Unfortunately she rushed us through our decisions and never offered any helpful options or features/benefits.  Happy hour lists appetizers being half off, but that's only some of them, and conveniently, the three I was considering were not those.  I understand there are small prints on deals at times so that could easily be overlooked.    The buffalo chicken dip appetizer we ordered was really good, but only worth $4 maybe $5 size-wise and could have been a lot better without the chunks of chicken.    My wife ordered the veggie calzone with pepperoncinis and mushrooms.  When this came out we were both impressed with the size, but the bread didn't have much flavor.  Along with this, recotta cheese was a very \"strange\" cheese to include being that its so grainy and overpowering.  It ruined the calzone for me altogether.    I ordered 18 wings on the bone.  6 suicide, 6 hot, and 6 pineapple teriyaki.  The wings had a good amount of chicken, more than any other restaurant, but the sauces ruined it for me again.  I can handle a lot of heat so my opinion may differ from others.  The suicide sauce wasn't very hot, but there were so many red pepper seeds everywhere and they were actually pretty gross, unless doused in ranch.  I felt they tried so hard to make them hot, they ignored the taste factor altogether.  The hot wings were very good and decently spicy.  The pineapple teriyaki wings were ok, but seemed almost soggy because of possibly soaking the wings in the sauce for hours, absolutely doused.  I'm not sure which wings caused it, and I NEVER get heartburn, but I did here.    While we were waiting for the bill, we realized our server was the only serving the entire restaurant.  I understand this isn't her fault, but the restaurants.  The bill finally came, she had overcharged us for the calzone.  All minimal things that could be overlooked, but so many that it ruined the entire experience.    With waters and those meals the total was $30.20.  I tipped $5 and got the hell out of there.  Should have gone to Tagliani's.  I took the extra food home, not to waste, but it just sat there in fear of heartburn again.  If you go for drink and wings, I imagine it could be somewhat of an enjoyable scene being the bar top tables are all close and near the bar and there are tv's everywhere.    I would have given 2 stars, but my stomach hurts now."}
{"text":"My wife & I  have been coming here for years.  We've come for Karaoke, to meet friends, bring the family, to enjoy a game on TV, for lunch and dinner ad enjoy a game on TV.  I think their wings are some of the best in town. If you want great tasting  NNY is the place to go.   the service here is always good. The food is always hot, fresh and fairly fast even when their busy. It's great for families, meetings or just to hang out.  FOOD: Always good. SERVICE: Professional & attentive. PRICE: The prices are compatible to places like Gallagher's ,Santisi Brothers Pizzeria and Sports Grill, Applebee's  or others like them in the area. CONCLUSION: Relaxed atmosphere where you can have a relaxed meal and spend some time doing it. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be exact. I've been coming to this Native New Yorker for as long as I can remember.  It is a great family restaurant and a fun place for happy hour or watching sports.  They have multiple t.v.'s on every wall. No matter where you sit, you have a view of some type of sports event. They are known for their wings, and well they should be.  Awhile back they used to have just plain teriyaki-flavored wings, but know they've kicked it up a notch with pineapple & teriyaki among other interesting flavors.  Besides the wings, they also have a full menu of sandwiches, pastas, pizza, salads and of course burgers.  My dad had a hot pastrami sandwich on our recent trip there, and he said it was the best one he has ever had.  I only give it 3.5 stars because although the menu has a variety of selections and the food is decent, it is all very predictable to me. Nothing really WOWs me with their food; but it's just above average for me to give it that 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday for an early dinner. I walked right into a casual sports orientated restaurant. The setting made me feel relaxed. The decor looked as if the walls were of faux brink with pictures from new york splattered throughout the building. The lighting was dim, which made sports watching nice and comfy. The restaurant wasn't open, but ran into different rooms, and came with a couple of flat screen TVs per room. Which made it nice for different groups to be able to watch a couple of different games at the same time if needed.   When my husband and I walked in we were greeted by a super friendly hostess who right away sat us in a table. I noticed most of the wait staff seemed to be in their late twenties to mid thirties, and all were very friendly and welcoming. The workers really felt as if they were friends. I asked a few questions about how Sunday's are handled with what football games are shown.. They have the direct TV football package, so you can watch whatever game you want to if you show up early enough to reserve your teams game on the screen.   We checked out the menu and it wasn't anything glamorous, just bar type food. Sand witches, Burgers, Hot Wings, Steaks, you get the picture. Food ranges from $8-$15 a plate. My hubby and I ordered the Philly steak sandwiches with a side order of Hot Wings with the Strawberry sauce on it. We also ordered a couple of drafts. They had a good selection of drafts to choose from.   We waited and watched some college football, and our order showed up. The plate was huge, and the food was decent. Nothing spectacular, but OK food. The Hot Wings, I didn't care for the sauce, I probably would order a different kind, next time. The sauce didn't give me the heat I love in my wings. But the wings are cheap, like 55cents a piece and you can mix up different types if you like.   We had a 1/2 off meal coupon from the entertainment guide so with 3 22oz drafts, and two meals with 5 hot wings our meal was about $35 with tip. So a very good bargin. I'll be back, the service is amazing, and the beer is nice and cold."}
{"text":"Ate there Sunday for lunch it was the worse pizza I have ever eaten we had the house special! I have eaten  frozen pizza that tasted better! First and last time I will visit, husband agreed with me!!"}
{"text":"Good service, love the Parmesan dry rub wings. Buffalo Chicken dip is fantastic. Can always ways find a yummy wing.."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either.  My friends like to go here to meet and hang out... and yeah, I'll be back.  It's pretty much middle of the road.  I have other joints like this I'd rather go to first.  I like the wings, I like some of the other stuff... their kitchen takes FOREVER though.  It's like, did you have to kill the chickens first???  The service is friendly although they tend to be a bit slow in refills of soda or water, but real quick to refill your beer."}
{"text":"Some friends took us here to eat.  Everything was OK.   The pepperoni pizza was average.  There was not very much pepperoni.  The hot wings were nothing special but the honey wings were very good.  Service and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"I come to Native most often for Happy Hour, and the wings are what keep me coming back.  I most recently tried to pineapple teriyaki, but the honey hot bbq are my favorite.  My only complaint is on Fridays more often than not I'm left with an empty beer glass and need to actively hunt down a server for another, and that doesn't bode well for washing down all those wings.  I've come on other days during the week and haven't had that problem.  Maybe the bar could use another server or 2 on peak days/hours.  That's the only thing keeping them from a 5 star review...."}
{"text":"Closed as of January. 29, 2015           Other locations still open according to the sign."}
{"text":"So I am not a big fan of going out to eat in Anthem, because I try to avoid chains as much as possible, but I was forced to go after our attempt to grab lunch at Mr. Gyros (not open at 11:00) was unsuccessful.  Since I work in this area, choices are limited and decided to give it a try.  The food was your typical bar/restaurant food.  I always get their wings there but I decided to order a chicken salad this time.  I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken was freshly cooked and it wasn't the precooked chicken you typically get.  The greens were iceberg lettuce, with tomatoes, and cheese, which I skipped.  Unfortunately, they don't offer any lowfat dressing but they have oil and vinegar, which is always great for those who are looking for low fat dressing.  I probably would have gave this place 2 stars but the service was outstanding and bumped it up to 3.  Our waiter was friendly and so cheerful as well as the other staff there.  The place was pretty empty, so you know they were not cheerful about the lack of tips they were going to make during lunch time.  Happy people make my meal experience much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years until today. And with minimal shame, I actually went there twice. The Happy Hour is from 11am - 7pm. That is amazing. I like to refer to it as a 'Happy Day' special.  Both times I went, I got the chicken strips which are on the happy hour menu. Great both times. $2.50 draft pints. I only have one complaint.  I'm not sure if they change it at night, but the volume was muted on all of the televisions and the radio was playing instead. If I'm at a sports bar, I'd rather not listen to 99.9 FM, but instead hear SportsCenter."}
{"text":"They did a recent remodel, knocking down the wall that separates the bar from the restaurant. Now, while dining you have to deal with loud music and a DJ spouting off trivia. Too loud ad even the waitress had trouble hearing us order. Used to be fun with occasional slow service just nose dived to annoyingly loud dinner. No longer worth the trip for .39 cent hot wings.  Went back shortly after posting this and found that they got rid of the loud music and DJ.  Now it's much more enjoyable to take them family. Guess a bunch of people complained about the the same things."}
{"text":"I sit here at the bar, reading a sign that says the \"no longer show UFC fights\" effective today...which is the usual day for it. I come here a couple times a month for a pint. The waitstaff is pleasant, but the kitchen staff are mostly retarded. Last week the walk in cooler went out, and they had to serve bottled beer out of Igloo coolers...waiting for the owners to put $$ into the repairs. They own a couple other locations that are more profitable...this is simply no longer a viable money maker for them. A local tip...this place is for sale. Check bizbuysell.com for listing. It can be yours for a steal. Cut it in half, think up a cool name ( I like Stagger Inn), and be your own boss!!!  As the choices are somewhat slim for Goodyear, we are stuck with what the Beer Gods give us.  DCM"}
{"text":"So wait, this is not a Native anymore? They disfranchised? Huh. Do they still offer $.39 wings on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Anywho... I went there several weeks ago and they were remodeling and the restaurant was a hot mess. They literally only had maybe 6 table available to be sat at. The comfort level of the dining room sucked, but the wings made up for it. I have been to a few Native's before, most commonly the Dobson/Guadalupe location. The wings at this Val Vista location are over twice the size of other Native's. Now, I should be grossed out because that probably means that this Native buys chicken wings that came from chickens that were pumped full of steroids and whatnot, but I don't care. I love me a meaty chicken wing! Another thing I liked about this location, is that they didn't lay the wings down on a plate of sauce. When I am eating HOT wings, I don't need any extra hot. I would totally recommend this location. I'm a little worried if they really aren't a Native New Yorker anymore, cause they may have done away with the $.39 wing days - but if you are gonna pay full price for a chicken wing, at least you get your moneys worth here."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would--went here last December for a friend's birthday.  While sitting in the bar, a cockroach climbed up the wall behind her.  I alerted the waiter who ran in back and disappeared for at least 5 minutes.  In the meantime, another patron still wearing a full suit from his work day had to kill the cockroach.  Reported it to the state who went out and determined they should get rated a gold star!  Disgusting, I have not and will not return. If there are cockroaches in December, just imagine how many there are in the July heat!"}
{"text":"Here for the 35 cent wings and now I remember why I stopped coming here.  Extremely slow service, tiny teeny itty bitty wings & flat beer.  Got here at 7:30 and barely leaving at 9p due to the ridiculous wait time."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed! They are constantly changing their days they do wing specials and what kind of wings are on those days. This place has really gone down since their new menu,  seems way too corporate. Do yourself a favor, stay away from here and go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead."}
{"text":"My bro & I requisitioned some calzonez at Native New Yowka for lunch yesterday. Mine was a veggie.  The thing was \"A-Ok\", but didn't quite have as much mozzarella as I would like in my crusty baked pockets o' cheese.   All in all, the Naive Nu Yowka is no comparison to a good calzone spot like Oregano's, Pizza Heaven or similar."}
{"text":"I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses."}
{"text":"Shockingly disappointing! Tipped the bartender 20% on our to go meal and waited FOREVER! I kept thinking it's because I ordered a pizza and they were making it fresh. However, the pizza was cold when I got home and I'm only 4 miles away! To top it off, she didn't give us any silverware to eat our cookie sundae dessert, no crushed red pepper for the pizza, AND no napkins at all! Did I mention we had a dozen wings?!?! No napkins???? Yikes. Talk about poor service. I should've tipped the cooks cuz the bartender didn't do anything for me other than bring me a water and then she forgot about my order! I waited over 40 minutes. Ridiculous. The bartender should've asked me if I needed napkins, silverware, etc, if she didn't plan on automatically including it.  Truly disappointing visit tonight and you can't blame it on the place being busy. It was 1015pm on a Tuesday night and there were only a few tables.  Native Newyorker food is always great, but not when it's cold. Take my advice- Don't order to go. The food would probably arrive sooner, still be hot, and you'd certainly have napkins if you ate at a table."}
{"text":"We got in line, gave our name, then MANY people who came after us were seated before us. Fuck me right?   We like the wings, the rest of the food was meh.  Took a good fifteen minutes from when we got the bill to when we could sign it and leave, we were even right next to the register."}
{"text":"This review id for my most recent visit ONLY.   It was good but not great. I had the mini chicken hotwing sandwhich with blue cheese and Frys. 6 bucks I added the sprite because the water is shitty tasting.   The coworkers had, wings and chili cheesefrys and cheese bread. They seemed to enjoy the wings and the chili cheese frys were really good. Nice chili and cheese on cury frys."}
{"text":"The wife took me here for a quick Friday night little date.  The set up is weird and we were seated facing another table, but other than that everything was pretty good.  I really liked their wings, good tangy sauce, not too vinegary.  I had a margarita, it wasn't half bad... its hard to find a good one which is why I make them myself.  Wife had beer... that lime one, whatever its called.    We had a good time talking and eating and watching football... well I mostly stared at the screen wondering if I would ever really understand it while she tried to explain what just happened.  Touchdown?  No?  Oh.   I'd love to try the Strawberry wings that Cyndi S. mentioned, they sound awesome.    I'd go back... the service was friendly but it did seem like they forgot about us at some point.  I forgive them."}
{"text":"They have a nice  2 for $20 menu with a shared appetizer and two main courses. The bacon and cheese flatbread is delicious and addictive. My burger was just right but the fries tasted as if they been reheated. My date enjoyed his chicken strips but was not impressed with the fries either. Karoke happens on Friday and lets just say it was interesting to say the least. All in all it was ok."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good most of the time, though a bit inconsistent in service speed and quality.  I do like the wings quite a bit, and some of their other offerings are quite good.  There's nothing particularly outstanding though.  Every now and then it seems like service takes forever, while sometimes it is fast."}
{"text":"OK, I've been to quite a few Native's in my day, but I'm writing about this one since I've been frequenting this one lately. Since two of my good friends like to live waaaay East, this is like a half way point.  Anyway, happy hour is long and good, and I've only had a bad NNY wing experience once and it wasn't here and I can't remember where that was (damn you middle age!!)  It's small, but I like the bar area, that's what I'm there for. They probably should play the games and not the country station though..."}
{"text":"Standard fare, there I pretty much summed up what you should expect from this Native New Yorker location.  That being said they do a decent job at the standard fare. The food is consistently mediocre which, in my opinion, is better than somewhere with outstanding food one trip and lousy food another time. The wings (which my co-worker orders every time) always look and taste the same. Also, they are 0.35 cents on Tuesday and Thursday. The sandwiches are fairly good. I stick with the Italian and curly fries.   This location does stand out from other Natives as they have $2 Pabst Blue Ribbon 22oz beers all the time. Quite a good deal.  They also have free UFC fights, so if you're into those types of things it might be worth a trip to not pay for it at another bar with equal amounts of average bar drinks/food."}
{"text":"Wings, Wings, Wings, and more Wings!  I have always been a fan of Native on Bell and am disappointed to see so many low star reviews.  The wings have never let me down and the beer is always cold.  Happy hour is the best time to enjoy discounted drinks and if you dine in on Tuesday enjoy discounted wings as well.  Sunday boasts the NFL ticket with many nice TVs to view your favorite team.   It would be nice to see it go back to the Bills bar that it used to be.  Keep staying strong Native on Bell!"}
{"text":"I would not go to Native New Yorker nearly as much if I didn't live in Anthem, but my choices are pretty limited. Here's what I like about it, Chris is my favorite server, and he's awesome and on top of his shit. There's lots of options besides pizza, which makes me happy. Lots of salads, burgers, sandwiches, baked potatoes, and pastas. Happy hour is pretty good, too. Prices are reasonable at non happy hour times and it's super kid friendly so I don't feel like an asshole bringing my 2 year old. Oh heads up, lots and lots of cheddar jack? cheese on the spinach dip, which is different, but I like. I also love love the honey hot sauce for the wings. I make my husband take the meat of the bones for me cause chicken on bones is gross. Yea, I said it.  Here's what I don't like. Whenever Chris isn't working, the service isnt great. I waited for my check forever last time, pretty much pre bussed my own table (no problem, I had plenty of time) while watching our server watch the game on tv. Like I said, I have a 2 year old. After he's done eating, its a very short window of time before things gets real out of hand. Also, Im a baked potato fan and its a 50/50 shot of whether or not mine will be cooked. Hard \"baked\" potatoes are not delicious. How hard is to make sure a potato is done?  Overall, it's bar food, but good bar food, with lots of variety. So if youre in Anthem, first, ask yourself why? Then, if youre hungry, go to Native, but only if Chris is working and you can sit in his section. And dont get all fancy with your ordering, theyre better at basics. Except basic baked potatoes, that they suck at."}
{"text":"awesome wings, best ive had since coming to arizona.  not a big fan of the asiago parmesan or the oriental garlic but the honey hot and strawberry hot are great"}
{"text":"Love wings? Then this is the place for you on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Normally the wings are .69 but in these two days they are only .49! I also love that there are 15 different flavors and you can order as many of each as you like. So if you want to try just 3 of several kinds of wings you can. I go mainly for the wings but the appetizers are also great. Several friends and family have had several non-wing items and they have always enjoyed their choices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place because we can walk there. The servers always remember my kids, this place is kid friendly. They remember us too when we leave the kids home and go to the bar (I know, parent of the year). The wings are good, my kids love the mozzarella sticks and pizza. They have karaoke some nights. They have a magic guy some nights. It's They have TV's for the sports.  Good enough for me. I can always find Brenden there!  Hey Brenden, your wife is lookin' for ya."}
{"text":"Good times! We sat in the bar after leaving Augies because we could not get service. I am glad we left. The service, food, and drinks were great. I had the cobb salad. Really good. A lot of toppings and great dressing-I ordered the Italian. My hubby had the chicken sliders and curly fries. He said it was great. I stole several fries and they were really good. My bro had the wings. He wanted 2 different sauces so she brought 2 orders on separate baskets, which was great because the sauces did not mix. The reason for 4 and not 5 stars was the price. I thought it was a bit expensive. Love to see a weekend happy hour."}
{"text":"why did I go back here?? I have no idea, but I will not be back ...ever! Ordered the buffalo chicken bites and the chicken was so overcooked that it was hard as a rock..yuck!  And also there was only one server..which was ok because they were not busy, however, she decided to go out to have a smoke and then returned to our table to see how we were doing and the smell made me sick..do not go smoke and then return to a table smelling like that..very gross."}
{"text":"My all time favorite food is wings and I have eaten them at just about every pizza joint in the valley so to claim this as a 5 star is saying something.  The wings are always cooked to perfection. They even accommodate all requests and since I am  very particulat about how I like my wings that says a lot. I recommend NNY to all friends and family so I can go as often as possible."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who, to his credit, was swamped with tables). I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two \"managers\" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me.   We didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI-TOWN and chose not to take care of us :) haha"}
{"text":"***Customer service is critical to the success for any restaurant***  I come to this restaurant for lunch to order some buffalo wings.  I've only been to this reseaurant once previously and had buffalo wings there and they were pretty good so I thought I would give it another shot.    I am on a low carb diet at the time so I cannot have breaded wings.  When I got my order, I recieved breaded wings.  I told my waitress that I didn't want breaded wings and I had non-breaded wings from here once.  Her reply was \"you have to tell me that because all of our wings are breaded here\".  Instead of offering to take the wings back and correct the order I had to tell her that.  She just stood there in silence thinking I was going to accept these breaded wings.  When I mentioned about replacing the wings she replied, \"its going to take a while\".  I wasn't going to say anything but I am spending my money here and I should be treated with respect.    I went to the bar area and asked to speak with the manager on duty. I told him what had happened and he did take action.  The manager said it was not true and it only takes 8 minutes to cook.  When she came back, she seemed pissed and offered me another drink.  Although I didn't want another drink, she snatched up the drink while I was trying to tell her I didn't want another one.  My wings arrived as order and they were good as they were the last time.  Because of the quality of the food and how the manager responded,  I did not give this restaurant a 1 star.     To top it off, before I left she took it upon herself to explain to me what happened.  I have nearly 20 years of customer service.  If you make an error, you don't argue with your customer.  Just apologize for the error and offer to fix it.  It was her fault that she failed to ask how I wanted the wings.  I don't think it was necessary for her to come at my table to continue to go on about it.  If you are going to work in the service industry, you will have to grow a thick skin and not let little things irritate you such as a communication error as this one."}
{"text":"It's a good place to just chill and have some fun.  Their food is pretty good (they even have a huge veggie platter that I've never really seen anywhere else) and the service is good."}
{"text":"Dear owners of Native New Yorker, Seriously?? What the hell were you thinking?  First, you knock down the wall that separates the bar from the restaurant. Bad idea. Next, you got rid of the jukebox. Worse idea. What's next?? Get rid of trivia? Music? Wings? I used to love to come here. Now it's just not the same. I cringe when karaoke gets off collar because there are children in the restaurant.  On top of that, your manager yelled at a patron across the entire bar that he has dogs in the back of his truck with no water. Dude...it's like 60 degrees out...plus, you totally could have walked over to him and said it privately instead of blasting him all over the bar. You have turned one of our favorite places into another lame-ass restaurant. Sigh*   Sincerely,   Former patron"}
{"text":"Arrived here with family mainly  to satiate my desire for wings as  in the past I've had ok-good experiences with their suicide wings, E.G., three different locations seemed to have differing levels of heat.    Was in Sat night, early evening. Wings didn't exactly themselves-it to the table and after 2-3 had pretty much come to the conclusion that they'd sat a while, had already been heated more than once or the oil was getting pretty fricking old..They also were not exactly  physically hot.  On floor manager seemed to take a while to register that I thought some, or all, of those had happened and , since they were suicides they had no return so I thought I'll eat them anyway ( sauce covering some of the sins of the cook)   They took em away , they reappeared really quickly (like 1/5 the time the original order took and now had so much hotsauce on them some of the wings were actually submerged ( that if meant to teach me anything was appreciated..I love heat:D    I'm pretty sure they just fired these again   My entree , never get this. Buffalo fish sliders appeared with a scratch of the sauce/ cabbage, some oil, same crap just tasted of oil , so I used some of their hotsauce to kill that too.    The kid's meal was  good and while the wife's was a pretty watery chicken pot pie it tasted good. Service was as slow from the kitchen has others suggested  and  while I would usually  do 2.5 rounded up to  3... I'm going to round down to 2.. If you pride yourself on  wings and then let anorexic, cold and oily items substitute for them then I will trade the nicer booths, wider drink choice to head to Steakenburger because their wings truly do not suck."}
{"text":"suicide wings when we ordered hot. I have been to like 5 different Native's in AZ and these were by far the hottest wings I have ever had. Was it a cruel prank from the kitchen because they were slow? methinks not! Pizza was ok, leaning towards the too greasy side. Just not the best pizza sports bar time me and the wife have had out on the town. Don't think I will be back for round 2. Maybe they are better when they are packed..."}
{"text":"Not good.  The medium prices are not worth the blah food.  Mushroom burger: greasy but did not taste good.  Steak fries: bland and dry.  Curly fries: tasteless and cold.    Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've never been here for dinner or a meal or anything like that, but I have been here a few times for karaoke.   The first time I went, it was a little hard to see form the road as the sign was dim but I made it. The place is clean and the staff is nice. They stay on top of the bill and last time split checks with ease :)  No matter how packed the place gets they're always there to make sure your glass stays full.   When I was DD, I was never charged for my soda or water.. or if I was, someone else put it on theirs.  The karaoke runs fairly smoothly, but the selection of songs is pretty lacking, at least for my taste."}
{"text":"This particular location isn't the greatest when it comes to service. I have a tendency of only going to the bar, where you'd expect stellar service, however, there was no bartender on site. It turns out she was also waiting tables!!   The happy hour prices for beer is great! I believe it's less than $3 for a large beer. Their wings are awesome. Their pizza is ok. Stick with the appetizers & salads. The rest of their menu is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Tonight waited about 30 minutes to get the attention of the bartender to get an order placed.  She replied that I didnt ask her for anything.   Wow!  I thought it was your job to check on me?  I was not offered a menu when I got there.  She blamed it on being short and me not asking for something, stating she thought I was just there to hang out..   Finally had my wings tossed to me IN A BOX!  No napkins or plate for the bones.  She finally came back around asking if I needed anything and I had to explain Lonnie had given me napkins and a plate.  She said she ASSUMED I wanted it to go.  REALLY??? I had just ordered an adult beverage!  It will be a LONG time (if ever) that I go back and I have been going for 10 years."}
{"text":"I met a friend here recently for lunch.  They had a good selection of lunch specials starting at $5.99.  Unfortunately, the entree that I ordered was not very hardy in the least.  I got Buffalo Sliders with curly fries.  The curly fries were good, but the sliders was sub-par.  Not only was there not much buffalo flavor, there really wasn't that much food.  I mean, I know sliders by nature are small, but it was almost as if I ordered mini-sliders!  I've been here many times over the years (including a memorable wing eating contest with a couple of friends where I ate 3 dozen...and wasn't in the top 3!) and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed.    The service was ok, though I wasn't asked if I wanted my water to be refilled until we had been there for well over an hour.  I was also disappointed that they wouldn't accept my 'BOGOF' entertainment coupon because my entree wasn't from the regular menu.  The coupon certainly didn't qualify which entrees were eligible or not, and I wasn't feeling ornery enough to fight about the $6.    They probably deserve 2.5 stars rather than 2 stars, but I can't give halfs and since they have been on their downward trend for awhile, I figure I might as well give them the downward grade..."}
{"text":"Service was good, this location is the best spot to eat in the area next to Santisi Brothers since the entire strip mall area isn't doing well.  I love the honey bbq wings they sell here (pretty much live for them when I go here).  I had the pizza this weekend and it was OK, my wife ordered bruchetta but it looked more like a tortilla with canned tomato on it (didn't taste very good).  The atmosphere is really nice here too, I like Native New Yorker and like to stop in every few months.  Also is a great place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"My favorite wing spot!  You can find me here every Tuesday!  Sometimes you get jumbo wings, sometimes you get above average size wings, sauce is always consistently good!  Andrew in the bar is the best server around."}
{"text":"Just so everybody knows who is reading this the location off of 27th Avenue and Bell Road has been closed down. The next nearest location is off of I 17 and Dunlap or Tatum and Bell Road"}
{"text":"Recently came always love the wings but wtf they took steak fries and curly fries off the menu. Please put them back plesse."}
{"text":"Im an actual native new yorker so I was a little apprehensive to come visit this place at first but a lot of friends told me this place was amazing.  Even with low expectations I was left pretty dissapointed. The staff never checked on us, seems to be waiting out the clock and all the food tasted like it came out of the microwave."}
{"text":"Every trip to Phoenix, I to my Native!!  HONEY HOT wings and a few to go. They have great bartenders who will whoop it up every now and then just to get everyone going. How? Hmm, games to win what else? Free alcohol. Great place, the service is on top of it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's this location, it's management or just the fact that the food really sucks but it's gone from a really good place to meet and eat to about the last place you want to choose unless you're really desperate.   First off for a place that features 3 main menu items, Wings, Pizza and Calzones, all of them are horrible!   The wings are small, not breaded, usually have a bit of an aftertaste from old grease and for some reason you wait for 20 minutes for an order, these should be ready to go at all times! It's a staple on the menu! I always order my wings plain with sauce on the side, all their sauces seem to have broken down and are now pretty much just a layer of butter with color... not very appetizing at all!  On to the pizza, for some reason always burnt! I've ordered it on 3 different occasions and finally gave up after giving them the benefit of the doubt, thin crust, almost paper thin, an OK sauce but when you can order it and say, I'd rather have gone to Pizza Hut you know there is a problem.  Now the Calzones, totally in the other direction, these on 3 occasions have in each event been fully undercooked! It's as if the kitchen doesn't understand how to time orders so they put everything in at the same time and take it all out at the same time, sadly this doesn't work! Pizza and Calzone have different cooking times!!! They don't understand that and I've given up on the place.   My last visit there was for Monday Night Football and for a sports themed bar, they had 7 customers in the entire place and 2 were off duty employee's! To me if you can't get people in your place on Monday Night Football with a menu and bar geared to that crowd, you need to revamp and rethink what you're doing because it's not working!   My last outing there, several customers were talking about going Buffalo Wild Wings now that it reopened, Native made it too easy for people to make that decision!   Sorry guys call me when you figure it out!"}
{"text":"I used to be a die hard regular here and I seem to remember better wings and much much better pizza not to mention cheaper and stronger mixed drinks. Miss the Buffalo pics they had on the walls after all they are from the Buffalo area, why not show case that and not try to play as if you're a NYC place? The asiago wings rock but the pizza tastes like a cheap frozen type, wont order it again."}
{"text":"Severely overpriced for what you get.  However, the wings are pretty damn tasty."}
{"text":"When exactly did this place start sucking?  I can remember seeing it as a destination back in the 90's. Even through the first part of the 2000's it was old reliable.  Now, wings battered and bland (they DON'T batter them in NEW YORK!), pizza so-so, service so hit-or-miss that at times I feel like serving my own table.   What the hell happened?"}
{"text":"I used to like this place...but lately they always screw up my order and the food isn't that impressive. There are other places that you can get better wings for cheaper.  Go somewhere else. Not worth your time or money!"}
{"text":"Although I have been to Native New Yorker several times, before tonight's visit I read each of the reviews here before going.  I was surprised how lukewarm they were, I have always had a positive experience at NNY previously.  Today's visit had some extra meaning for me, though.  I had just returned from Buffalo and only a few days ago ate many of the local foods that have made Buffalo famous, including Duff's wings and beef on weck at Blackthorn.  As these are the Holy Grail of these two Buffalo traditions I did not dare to compare a franchised chain restaurant in the middle of the desert to what many regard as the best of the best.  But yet, since this place dubs themselves Native New Yorker I felt I had to hold them to some sort of standard.  Reading the reviews it seems the consensus is that most people think the food is okay but the service is terrible.  Here's my experience ...  We walked in, early evening on a Sunday.  The place had a comfortable number of patrons; just enough to feel at home here.  The greeter was friendly and found a good table for us immediately.  Within a minute or so our server came over and was friendly, knowledgeable and kept the welcome feeling going.  She was on-spot recommending the Long Island Iced Tea at only $3, and it turned out to be quite tasty, not anywhere near as over sweet as some places serve it.  I had to do the beef on weck and hot wings comparison and my dining companion followed along.  The wings were served in a reasonable amount of time after we were able to enjoy a few sips of our drinks.  How do they compare to the Gold Standard at Duff's?  Not bad.  The positives were they were a bit crispy and not drowned in hot sauce like they were spaghetti.  The not-so-positives were that they had very little meat on them and varied too much from one wing to another (every wing at Duff's is large, plump and meaty and they are all of substantial size).  At Duff's, they claim that their \"medium\" sauce is most other place's \"hot\" and I found that to be true.  At NNY their \"hot\" is what I would call \"mild\" by Buffalo standards.  Okay but certainly not hot.  The beef on weck was served in a timely manner and it looked pretty good.  I tasted some beef by itself and it had a nice taste to it.  The bun is mostly authentic, although it is too soft compared to what the Blackthorn in Buffalo makes in their own kitchen.  The horseradish is KILLER!  One of the hottest I have ever tasted.  Kudos, this is the first place that actually made me sweat a little over the horseradish and grab a gulp of water.   NNY cheats a little by serving some au jus with the sandwich (Blackthorn does not) which really makes it a French Dip, but if that's what people want, that's okay with me.  The accompanying steak fries are tasty and while I am not a big potato eater, I ate more than I would normally have.  Not only was the Long Island Iced Tea CHEAP but the beef on week was about the same price as you would pay almost anywhere in Buffalo ... under $9 per serving.  The entire meal for two, with drinks was under $30.  That's a deal.  Back to the server for a second ... the table next to us had the \"customer from hades\".  If I had been the server I probably would have thrown the meal in his face and quit on the spot.  Our server had the patience of Job, however, and did an awesome job dealing with the completely unreasonable.  She's the reason I added a star to this review.  I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expected but I think Native New Yorker hits pretty close to some of the legendary Buffalo icons in both food and service."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to check out the new Native in the Arrowhead area, the Black Eyed Pea building sat empty for a long time.  Upon walking in the door we saw a totally empty dining room with the chairs upon the tables, to the left and, a pretty empty bar on the right. We were really hungry and the kitchen was still open so we decided to stay. We started off with a disappointing look from the bartender that she had to serve any more people! (it was 9:40pm).  We realized it was late so we ordered the ribs because they are mostly prepared ahead of time. The ribs were dropped off with no explanation of which sauce is what. Sooo we dipped some of the greasiest fries I have ever seen in to the sauces to figure out the flavors. The ribs sucked they were grizzly (fatty, greasy with hard chunks of bone or burnt food, actually had to spit mine out twice!).  Overall the bartender was unfriendly and offered no \"service\" aspects that you would look for when eating out. Seeing the empty dining room upon arrival kind of sets the tone for the evening. I really feel like the management or servers really dont care about there jobs or putting out a good product. The best part of the night was the big garage like doors were open when we sat down, but the bartender closed them soon thereafter, guess it was time to close! not tome to serve!  Id have to hear some real good things to go back to this joint, such a shame its a beautiful building."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day with a co worker, and was not impressed. We sat at the bar, hoping to get faster service, since we were on a time schedule. After about 40 min, and 2 drinks later, our food finally came out. Wasn't impressed. I got a chili dog, and to my surprise, there were 2 of them on my plate. I ate one, and saved the other one for later. Needless to say I was friends with the toilet that evening and threw the other one away. I'll leave the chili dogs to Chicago, they seem to get it there."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to go in after reading the other reviews, but I am very glad I did. Not only did we have great service, but the food was very good. I really liked the fact that almost everyone in the place seemed to be a regular. The staff made us feel very welcome and my family agreed that we felt very comfortable there. While the bar is open to the dining room, there are many other restaurants set up the same way and tonight I did not see any issue with it. There are great specials on Tues & Thur nights on wings and beer so I am sure we will be regulars in no time."}
{"text":"This place is a neat Arizona franchise that offers decent food, sports on TV, and fun times.  I like doing the \"playmakers\" which is a little electronic thing that give you that corresponds with a TV so you can play trivia.  The food here is a step up from a Denny's. The burger is good, but the meat is always a bit dry and not juicy.  Maybe I need to order it medium rare next time.  Their wings are really good too.  The dim lighting and cozy seating make a good atmosphere and all the flat screens give you plenty of sports to watch.  Good times."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with some friends who are regulars for karaoke. The place had some great drink specials (3$ long islands...that were actually good, 2$ sex on the beach shots, cheap beers). We had some boneless wings, which were alright but not very spicy...tried both the medium and the bbq hot and both were mild. The service was fine and the karaoke was also pretty good, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a place to eat."}
{"text":"The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \"OK\" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude."}
{"text":"I love these wings. LOVE THEM. Other locations are just not as good. My friend and I frequent this place way more than we should for lunch, usually after a workout so we can pretend to justify it. :-)  We're usually there between 11:30-12, and it's not extremely busy. The service has always been excellent. Actually, and I don't know if I should be ashamed to admit this, but the server now knows us. Today when we were there brought everything out for us. We didn't even have to order! I'm not sure how it is in the evenings, but if you want wings for lunch this is the place to go. You'll probably see us there- just look for the two in workout clothes!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the entertainment was great (Karaoke), but the 2 stars of 5 is because my friend got food poisoning there and was throwing up for 2 days and could not eat or hold anything down sadly.  I hope they improve on all food handling practices and dispose of any old, spoiled food and not serve it.  I told my friend to get things that rotate more often such as wings or pizza next time.  She does not want to eat there ever again."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was good not great.  I can't say I was a big fan of the atmosphere.  Kind of dark and dingy.  I'd go again but this restaurant probably wouldn't be my first pick."}
{"text":"1988 called, they want their old ass, outdated, cheap garbage pretend brick sheet paneling and pathetic NY Plastic covered art work that wouldn't look good in a garage back.   Seriously. This place is dark. Musty. STILL Smells from when smoking inside was legal. The exterior is worn. The landscape is tired and needs help. Theres NOTHING inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all. The interior is WORSE. Deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush. Yummmmm.. (I think I just threw up a little in my mouth)  The owner needs to wake up. The hey day of NNY is OVER.   DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. Travel another 500 feet to Santisi brothers in the same parking lot by the sticky floor cinemas and walk into a place with like 400 TVs all streaming everything you could imagine. Cute friendly waitresses. GREAT food. NON breaded wings. And NO. I dont work for Santisi. Its just a much better place. Seriously. Its actually what NNY wishes it was."}
