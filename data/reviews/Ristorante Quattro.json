{"text":"I visited this restaurant only a few weeks after returning from Rome, Italy. I was very surprised to find authentic Italian tastes in Old Montreal! Their mushroom risotto was very delicious and and recommended. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful when we were making our dinner decisions. I'd definitely go back for a romantic dinner or when I crave authentic Italian!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try some fresh homemade pasta, and I am very suspicious that I ended up paying 34$ for a few strands of 2$ boxed pasta. I have made better pasta meals in my beginner cook student days."}
{"text":"I came here after walking up and down the street looking for a restaurant to have a late lunch.  This was the only one that caught my eye.   This restaurant was pretty much empty with the exception of 1 table of people when we strolled in around 1:30pm on a week day.  This place looks like your typical classy restaurant with a large bar with a wide array of wines, white linen tables and exposed brick on both sides of the restaurant.  Service was friendly but the food was a tad slow - probably because they didn't have much kitchen staff onboard at this time (when I walked by the kitchen, there only seemed to be a couple of people in there).   Anyway, I had their lunch special which was $18 for a soup of the day, a main from a short list, dessert & coffee/tea.  I chose their bolognese penne and their soup, we were told, was zucchini but we think it was butternut squash since it was orange. Umm...yeah, maybe we heard wrong.  No matter, I really like butternut squash soup so I enjoyed it.  We were also served crusty bread (yummeh!) with olive oil & balsamic vinegar.  My penne was a bit on the oily side but the bolognese sauce was hearty with the ground meat.  I wanted a bit of spice so our waiter got me some house made chili oil - fantastic!  It gave the kick I wanted and I do prefer chili oil over chili flakes. My fiance had the fish of the day which was halibut.  It was cooked really well - flaky with a seared crust on the outside.  It came with broccolini, yellow peppers & potatoes. He really liked the fish and yellow peppers but didn't care too much for the broccolini & potatoes.   My dessert was a bay leaf flavoured panna cotta.  Niiiice!  Never had it before so I was looking forward to it.  It was very good and the bay leaf flavour was strong but not overwhelming. I thought it was interesting and tasty.   Glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"Veal Chop is by far the best. Cooked to perfection. The grilled octopus and calmari are to die for. You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"My mom wanted Italian, so we decided to check it out. Loved this place. The only thing that brought it down to 4 stars was the price of a small Caesar salad - $10?!?  We had the penne with truffle cream and sausage (definitely recommend), pappardelle with prosciutto (would eat again, but nothing outstanding), the fish of the day, and the veal with lemon butter sauce (the latter 2 were ok).   We had gotten the grilled octopus appetizer as well...so soft and tender with a hint of chargrilled taste. Yum! My sister was on a hunt for delicious creme brûlée and we certainly found it here.   All in all, a definite recommend!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waitstaff.  I ordered calamari and mac and cheese for my main meal.  the calamari was tasty but I'm not a big fan of calamari patties.  The mac and cheese was great.  For dessert the chocolate souffle was very very good.  Great wine choices to round out the meal."}
{"text":"It was good, but not as good as it is expensive. The atmosphere is fine, nothing to get excited about.  The calamari appetizer is really disappointing.The pasta and bison are great. The service is friendly and somewhat attentive, but not as polished as it should be for the  amount of money you are spending. Servers are dressed as if they are working at an inexpensive chain restaurant. Not chic or professional, which really brings the  vibe down.  Overall, I would say the food is very good, but the experience is way overpriced."}
{"text":"Worst food and customer service in my life. There is no proper description on the menu and they force you to eat their crappy food when you complain about it. True disappointment . Not recommending this place to anyone unless you are ok with paying decent money to get crappy food and shitty attitude ."}
{"text":"I came here on the first night that I spent in Vieux-Montréal after a long train ride.  After reading the yelp reviews and seeing that it was close to the hotel we headed over here for a late night dinner.  First, in terms of service I really want to praise the Maitre D.  It was very close to closing and he still seated us and waited without pressuring us until we had fully finished our dinner.   We had the Risotto Porcini which was pretty good.  It had nice flavors but they didn't really come together/blend well. We also had a fish dish which I can no longer remember the name of.  This dish was pretty mediocre at best.  It was far too dry and really failed to pop flavor wise.    The atmosphere is wonderful and the staff extremely pleasant.  I would recommend however delving into more of the traditional Quebecois cuisine when in this region.  We went to Versus the next night and it was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant.  We went there to celebrate our daughter's18th birthday.  We arrived on time for our reservation, but as soon as we got in the door, we felt rushed by the wait staff.  They were constantly trying to hustle us through the meal.  We had a three course meal, and finished in well under 2 hours, even with us repeatedly telling the waiters we were in no rush and wished to take our time.   Plates were removed from the main course while some people were still trying to eat! They  clearly wanted to move patrons through as fast as possible.  This is not what I expect for a meal which cost $500 for 5 people.  The food was okay, but not great.  My daughter had the Mac and Cheese, and that was very well done, as were the salads. The Mushroom risotto was good, but I have had better. The deserts were okay, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is special. We had amazing service with a true Italian gentleman named Vince. We eat out a fair amount and consider ourselves foodies, we truly appreciate an outstanding meal, service, atmosphere, etc. If you are looking for exceptional service, wonderfully prepared Italian food in a very nice atmosphere, you must try Quattro! Each of the four of us in our party tried different dishes and sampled each others as well. They were all excellent! I can't imagine anyone leaving here disappointed."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, we were there with a big group, 6 adults and 5 kids, the food was great and the service even better, very accommodating and friendly staff, definitely recommended"}
{"text":"The wait staff was fantastic first impression.  Food, Bravo!  Ambiance well done.  Will add it to the list for anytime in Montreal."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on the recommendation of our hotel's concierge.  We didn't have reservations (Friday night), but although the restaurant was busy, we were seated right away.  We tried the paparadelle, penne, puttanesca, and gnocchi -- all excellent, though I think the gnocchi might have been the best of all.  Also, had caesar salad and tiramisu.  The service was friendly/attentive, and the pace of the meal was very leisurely (which I enjoyed, though some in our group called it slow).  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. The house-made Cesar dressing was simply perfect. Service was great. I mean really great, these people know what they're doing. Veal scaloppini was delicious. The wine selections were spot on. And the staff's wine recommendations matched both my taste and my meal. I'm coming back here every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great food, the cotoleta di vitello alla milanese was great, not to mention the lasagna I had the first time I was here. The service is great Francesco the owner is great and Chantal waitress was so excited we were out of town and she gave us great tips for the city. Great place to go in Montreal if you want Italian food."}
{"text":"Love the casual and friendly vibe - the owner made everyone feel welcome and well cared for.  Food was great and at a moderate price point.  Highly recommend.!"}
{"text":"We were very happy with our meal. I got the pappadellei pasta and it was fantastic. Also the tiramisu dessert was out of this world!  Nice ambience and nice staff highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was on vacation and I always indulge on vacation. So Tuesday night, after days of indulging in French food and steak houses, I sought some excellent Italian. Ristorante Quattro did not disappoint. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the filet mignon. My gnocchi was very good and my friend so enjoyed the filet that he called over the server to tell him so. I finished it off with the soufflé di cioccolato and I smiled with every spoonful. Bonus points to the entire staff for being very knowledgeable and full of personality. This is a must-visit when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Outstanding service from ownership and staff. Food was very tasty. Top 5 italian restaurants in MTL in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food tastes fantastic and looks beautiful. I also loved the atmosphere...a great place to have a romantic meal and to have dinner with friends. This place is all about passion. Nino and his staff share their passion for the quality of the ingredients, the great wine and their love of Montreal. They made us feel like family. Definitely try the fresh mozzarella. The Porchetta was tender and delicious served with wonderfully prepared roasted peppers, potato and spinach. And, you definitely need to try the chili oil! Wow amazing! It is made in house by the owner Nino himself. What a memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the fuss is about. I had the calamari appetizer, which was a bit tough. For a main, I had the rabbit. Not much flavor, and the meat was kind of dry. Although there were four pieces of meat, they seemed to be mostly bone, so there was not a lot of meat. Considering the prices they charge, I was not very impressed, nor very full..."}
{"text":"An absolute pleasure of culinary and dining experience. Francesco (Frank) and team provided an incredible evening. A true hidden gem of Montreal."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is perfectly executed rustic Italian. The gnocchi are like pillows and my husband (who is Italian) still hasn't stopped raving about his spaghetti puttanesca.  The partners who run the place are a delight. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the filet mignon and my wife had the gnocchi. Food coming from the kitchen was slow but the staff was apologetic. We ordered a bottle of wine but it was about 45-60mins before we got our entrees. We ended up finishing our bottle so the staff brought us two glasses of wine to enjoy with our entrees on the house to make up for the delay. We ordered tiramisu and cannolis for dessert and a couple cappuccinos. Desserts were delicious. When our server came with the bill she apologized again for the delay and let us know the desserts and cappuccinos were on the house as well. Really nice touch and much appreciated. We will definitely be back for dinner when we come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Une cuisine italienne comme ont aiment! Pour les amateurs de pâte :) the place to be!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We were in the mood for a good Italian dinner! The gnocchi and bolognese were perfectly cooked and hit the spot! The wait staff was very friendly and attentive! We will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience, and service.  The porcini risotto was excellent.  My husband loved the rabbit.  Service was impeccable.  The staff was gracious.  The restaurant also had good ambience and decor."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, great atmosphere, and friendly staff.  An unassuming facade leads you into an awesome reality.  A real 'don't miss' kind of place!  The breaded veal was spectacular and the accompanying arugula salad was unparalleled!"}
{"text":"It was our last night out in Montreal and we wanted a special dinner so after reading reviews here we decided to come here. Had the beet salad which was very good. We also had the macaroni and cheese which my daughter loved, the gnocchi which was homemade and also very good and the risotto. The risotto was probably our least favorite. The rice was a bit undercooked bit had good flavor. One of the three owners came over and talked with us. He was very nice and shared pictures of his family with us when we mentioned we were from California. Overall the food was a little overpriced but very good and service was very good."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The penne with truffle sauce and sausage is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Everything was great. The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. The atmosphere welcoming. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can not describe to you how terrible my experience with this place was. I was absolutely appalled.   I came in as part of a group of six and the place was empty. The fellow working asked if we had reservations, and gave us attitude when he learned that we didn't. We apologized and were about to leave when he said it was okay and he'd find room...   The service was slow, he critiqued our menu selections and yelled at one of our group (who had a late lunch) for just ordering a salad. Its not like he needed to up-sell, we all were drinking as well. After being there for an hour, I asked our server if the food would be out soon, as we had an event to get to. A nearby table of two who were seated well after us got their meals a full 15 minutes before we did.   The food was adequate. A  bit saltier than it needed to be, but good. I would have probably enjoyed it if I weren't so bamboozled by the behavior of the fellow working there. We ate quickly.    When we asked for the bill, I indicated to the server that there something wrong on my bill and then tried to act like it was my fault. At this point I was a bit short with him. Not unkind, but losing patience. Let me preface what comes next by saying that I did leave a tip. After I'd settled and my friends were in the process of doing the same, I stepped outside to let others know we were done dinner. Once I was out of earshot, the server remarked to my friends that I was a bitch.The waitstaff called me a bitch. To my friends.   We left absolutely incredulous. Never again."}
{"text":"Caveat: this review is only for the particular meal I had. The service was excellent. If not for the service, this would be only 1 star.   I ordered the fish of the day: Monkfish. I had never had monkfish before. It's probably something better left in the sea, or lake, wherever it comes from. Before even taking a bite, I was concerned by how tough it was to cut through with a steak knife. The second bite confirmed the first, a strong message from my mouth to my brain telling me not to continue with this meal. The only tougher seafood I could compare it to is raw octopus. Obviously it's nowhere near as rubbery as octopus, but under the sea (or lake, or wherever it comes from), the monkfish is the next contender.   The soup: the monkfish came with vegetable soup. Said soup was oddly reminiscent of campbells. I'm not saying it came from a can - it clearly didn't. What I am saying is that they have impressively figured out how to give fresh soup an uncanny similarity to soup usually stored up against the possibility of an apocalypse. Must have been a rough day at work because I finished every drop of that apocalyptic soup.   Again, the service was superb. Would I go back and order something different? Honestly? Probably not. Too many other highly rated restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I have dined at a fair share of Italian restaurants, but this one is probably one of my new favourites.   I was visiting Montreal for the weekend and my partner and I were looking for a nice night out. We decided to go for Italian food and I had read some previous reviews about this place and decided to check it out.   It is a gorgeous, beautifully decorated restaurant and is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. The food was amazingly fresh. You will most definitely walk out feeling very satisfied with the quantities. We had calamari, pappadelle pasta and probably the best Tiramisu that I've ever had here. Service was wonderful and the staff were very personable.   I will remember this restaurant for the amazing ambiance, delicious food, and the charismatic staff. Prices are very reasonable and worth it for the whole experience! Men: take your partners/wives here. They will love it!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go.... couldn't ask for better service.  From making a special drink to making a special dish. Then at the end of the night making the birthday boy feel special.  Thank you Marco and Charlie for making myself and my family feel welcome"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very nice staff. Ice cold beer. Under staffed and very slow. The staff kept attending to us however nothing was happening. It was quite a predicament. Very nice people reassuring you with nothing behind their reassurances.    Under cooked pasta. (I know some places have differing opinions of alienate however hard is hard.) the salad was OK, typical ceaser. Octopus was on par with the best ever. Roast rabbit was dry like cardboard with what tasted like fancy feast cat food liver stuffing.   Much better places in this city. I'd stick to the recommendations below. I saw some of the pasta recommended below and they all left me with regret for not trying them."}
{"text":"So many 5 stars for this restaurant but not from me, even though I am usually pretty generous.  We showed up there on a Saturday night without a reservation but we were seated immediately. The restaurant gradually filled up to capacity. The service was A+, true professional waiters that knows how to do just enough, great classy ambiance.  But the food was less than fantastic and as a result, the prices are unwarranted. First the free bruchetta appetizer: nothing special, then the free stale white bread with hard butter: come on. What are you saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?  I took the table d'hôte: mushroom soup then the veal with mauve artichauds. It was good but I had the same for much less pesos. My friend meal was also good (tomato and mozarella, penne with sausage, gnocchi something) but left me equally unimpressed.   Maybe it is better if you bring your own wine because the cheapest bottle was 43$. We had one of the least expensive and it was -weak- ($12.50 at the wine store). I felt I was getting scammed on the wine.  I don't mind paying a lot for a good meal but you wont fool me into believing I had better by making me pay more.  I might have given this place a 4 star if the prices were more reasonable. Instead, I am left with a little after taste of tourist-trap."}
{"text":"My experience summed up in one word: outstanding.  Although the \"$$$\" on Yelp made us a bit hesitant, the 4.5 star rating convinced my friends and I to splurge a little for our last dinner in Montreal. Our meal was worth every penny.   We ordered 3 pastas: the Pappardelle, Linguini allo Scoglio and the Penne. All three were heavenly. The Pappardelle (pasta in a tomato cream sauce with Italian dry-cured ham) was rich and flavourful. I usually get sick of eating anything too creamy but the Pappardelle was so good I ate every single bite. The prosciutto (dry-cured ham) was delicious and perfectly complemented the pasta. Overall, a stellar dish and well worth the $25.   The Linguini allo Scoglio (spaghetti noodles in a light white wine and garlic dressing with seafood) was also delicious - it was flavourful without being \"heavy\" and had a deep but clean taste. I loved how the Linguini was packed with a wide variety of fresh seafood (muscles, shrimps, clams, etc) - you definitely get your money's worth.   Last but not least, the penne. The Penne (truffle cream sauce with sausages) is one of the most popular dishes at Ristorante Quattro and for good reason - it is unlike anything I have ever tasted before. The sauce was very rich and creamy like a typical Alfredo sauce but it had a unique hint of sweetness reminiscent of melted white chocolate. Very distinct and pleasant  flavour - definitely a must-try!   The customer service was beyond amazing as well. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and constantly checked up on our table to make sure we were satisfied with everything. The owner even personally recommended specific wines to go with each of our respective meals and assured us that there would be no charge if we did not enjoy his recommendation. He even brought me special Italian chilli oil for my bread when I told him I liked spicy food!   Overall, I had an amazing experience here - not only was the food outstanding, the customer service blew me away. Don't let the \"$$$\" stop you from taking a visit because it's not everyday you come across such an incredible gem."}
{"text":"recommended by a coworker and a seconded by locals, I really enjoyed my meal here.  very friendly and attentive staff.    the braised veal cheeks had a hint of spice and were cooked perfectly with a reasonable paired wine.    delicious!"}
{"text":"Really overpriced and I would never go back to this place. Spent Quattro times what I would at a good Italian restaurant, and still left the place hungry"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Quattro Saturday night after a satisfying March day wandering Montréal and visiting the amazing Leonard Cohen retrospective at MAC.  Our reservation email was promptly answered. We showed up in the midst of a light snow storm, which was on a March evening, perfect.  From the moment we walked in the door we were wrapped in welcome. It is the spirit of the place, they love their clientele and ensure you know it. Not cloying, not intimate, but embracing in an entirely human sense.   The atmosphere is rich without being gaudy. Tasteful without being reserved. Classy in a word We were dressed for Saturday night, but would have been as comfortable in something more casual.  She practices a vegan discipline and loved her vegan edited Insalata de rucola followed by a slightly edited pasta pomodoro. She raved about the pasta as the best she'd had.  I, a carnivore, started on a gentle note with the buratta which was heavenly... then to a stew featuring wild boar. Fabulous, rich, deeply satisfying. We had a conversation about boars in human history ( the porcine kind) and honored the animal but also the perfectly crisp and distinct root vegetables that made the boar his bed.   This place understands wine. She had an Italian chardonnay which she loved. I had a wonderful Barolo... both of which, by the glass, make so much sense and yet are unavailable in so many restaurants, even in Québec.  The service was unfailingly attentive and helpful. In a very busy place, the focus never wavered and we felt looked after.  As we put on our coats to wander off, the owner cane over to thank us and to look forward to our return.  That is the kind of place this is, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta dishes - good variety.  We really like the artwork on display on the walls.  Very comfortable place to dine with very friendly service."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere and food was really good. Had great crusty bread and really fresh tomato and basil bruschetta brought to the table automatically, so ordering an appetizer seemed like overkill.  In the touristy Vieux Port area, but not a touristy place. Nice wine selection and staff able and willing to make recommendations. Best Italian I've had outside NY"}
{"text":"This was an excellent dining experience.  It was not in the tourist section of Old Montreal.  We started with made to order sangria.. It was some of the best we ever had. The grilled octopus was tender and balanced with a citrus dressing with beans and peas. The Caesar salad was delicious. The gnocchi with sausage in cream sauce was outstanding.  The taglierini pasta in a meat sausage was perfect for the kids. My wife enjoyed her pappardelle in marinara sauce with a bit of prosciutto. I loved my veal. Dessert was crazy good...chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream capped dinner. What a very nice place for great Italian food. Very good service. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Un excellent spot pour manger des pates maison ! De plus, la mozzarella fraiche est tout simplement incroyable ! Tout au long du repas le proprietaire est venu plusieurs fois à table pour s'assurer que tout etait parfait ! Si un plat n'est pas a votre gout , dite le et ils vont le remplacer immediatement!   Ce restaurant est assez dispendieux mais pour feter quelque chose de special c'est une bonne option :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, entertaining and accurate service in a lovely environment.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Wow best grilled octopus ever! Service was excellently and pasta top notch. Our favorite Italian restaurant in Montreal"}
{"text":"It was subpar, the food was not good it was missing flavour and the service very very slow ! But I gave them two stars because I didn't get sick!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful. I ordered the filet mignon (medium) and it was cooked to perfection. My wife's pasta dish was also delicious. Desert was just as tasty. The staff was extremely pleasant and the ambiance was upscale yet still casual. Portion size was moderate given the high price."}
{"text":"Was quite happy with this find - thanks to all the Yelper's for the great advice. We were about a 8 minute walk from this place and had a nice brisk walk there. It's right around the block from the Notre Dame basilica which is a beautiful location itself.   The host was extremely friendly. I had made a reservation online about an hour before we intended to be there and received a prompt reply confirming my reservation. Turns out we didn't need it because it wasn't terribly busy. Our waitress was also very friendly and we enjoyed talking with her.   The food was excellent. I had veal with Gorgonzola and it was prepared perfectly. My girlfriend had the seafood linguine which she also liked a lot - the best part being that they didnt skimp out on the seafood.   We also split a tiramisu, which I'm normally not a fan of but can honestly say I truly enjoyed this one.   Bill came out to be over $100 after drinks - so be prepared for an expensive time. But I would say well worth a trip of your in the area!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on our first night in Montreal.  This place was close to our hotel and was highly recommended on Yelp.  I had the cesare salad to start and it was the best part of the meal.  Fresh, crisp romaine and homemade cesare dressing, with bacon.  For mains, I had veal scalopinni and my wife had seafood linguini.  The scalopinni was not as described, in terms of the sauce, so I was a little disappointed in that.  Also, the veal was a little chewy.  My wife enjoyed her linguini but I didn't try it so can't give a review on it."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant on our first night in Montreal out of the pouring rain.  We were a party of 6 and we did not have a reservation.  The restaurant was packed and we were not too hopeful that we would get in.  However, the manager/host (super friendly guy) quickly ran off to see if he could set-up a table for 6.  We were pleasantly surprised that he could seat us.  As one of the starters (on the house) he brought out some bruschetta that was very good.  Tons of flavor and it did not disappoint.  We knew if the starter was this great that the meal should hopefully be fabulous.  For our main entrees the table chose the following:  - Veal Milanese - Papperdelle (Ceaser to start - fantastic salad) - Chicken Pesto Pasta Special - Penne - Truffle/Sausage - Chicken Special with sundried Tomatoes (and Italian Bean/Pasta Soup to start)  They also had a great selection of wines.  Overall we had a great time and the food, service and ambience was just perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go to when I go to Montreal.  The service is wonderful and friendly.   They have a variety of drinks available, but they have more variety of wine and cocktails than beer. They have wine available by the glass and in the bottle.   The food is outstanding. Last time I was there, I had a wonderful beet appetizer and tagliatelle dish with cream sauce and pancetta.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a great Italian spot.... but this isn't just a \"good\" Italian spot - It is an INCREDIBLE Italian spot. Had my birthday dinner here while visiting Montreal and this restaurant is the single thing that I am looking forward too upon my return back to Canada. The owners are so friendly and come around checking on all the tables. The food -- everything was fresh, home made and out of this world."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and ambiance. The owner recommended our dishes and wine. The red sauce was amazeballs!"}
{"text":"Dinner - Nov 5, 2012  Absolutely excellent.  Loved everything about dinner and the restaurant.  Enjoyed the 8oz black Angus fillet Mignon served medium rare with a pepper sauce.  One of the best I ever had.  Extremely tender and flavorful.  The Cesar salad was of good size and very enjoyable.  Creme Brulee was excellent too.    Service is the best, very attentive, but not overly attentive - perfect.  I would return, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good food (parppadelle & puttanesca, nom NOM), good wine,  good location. The bruschetta starter was alright, too much raw garlic imo.   The service was slow and disorganised, hence the 4 stars. Too bad, better luck next time, the pasta was good enough for a second visit."}
{"text":"Ok. So, we passed over this place several times in search of other restaurants during our 7 day stay in Montreal. Wish we'd come earlier. A gem of homemade Italian cuisine.   Started with the meatballs - wow. Tender and tasty, melt in your mouth balls of goodness. Fantastic appetizer. We also ordered the grilled octopus. It had a delicious char on the outside. Just enough to flavor bit not take away for the delicate taste of octopus. On a fresh salad with simple but fresh tomatoes, orange pieces and arugula. Stunning.    We ordered the puttanesca and the braised veal cheeks. Outstanding on both accounts. The puttanesca sauce was perfect. Salty, briny and with a bite mixed with al dente spaghetti. The cheeks took me back home to my Cuban roots. Fantastically meaty and with the right amount of fat, just perfectly braised. Oh, so tender meat. Accompanied with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Highly recommended as it was part of the fixed price menu. It included soup or salad and coffee or tea.   Great tiramisu and cannolis. Highly recommend this restaurant. And Francesco is so personable. Cannot wait to return to Montreal and visit this place. Felt like I was home."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Better than some we had in Italy.  The staff was very friendly and genuine.  We chatted but he knew where to draw a boundary and let us eat.  We were told to have the chocolate soufle by other write-ups.  It was as a good as they said.  This was quite a find and I think  everyone will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place, really did.  The owner is so nice and friendly, the food is great!  The service was ....Terrible.  The meal took longer than any meal  over 4 days in the city.  The server \"forgot\" to put our order in to the kitchen.  We were left alone for 15-20 minutes at a time. Could not get anyone's attention without practically standing up and waving them over with a flag.  Food/ dishes/ wine glasses were whisked away without a word or eye contact, let alone asking we needed or wanting anything.  But the food was amazing!  I hope this was just an off night for them."}
{"text":"The owner is a fantastic character who is very fun to talk to. Bread was delicious, gnocchi perfectly tender. The meat sauce was perfection, and the tiramisu...luscious!"}
{"text":"We decided to make a pit stop in Montreal on the way home and really wanted pasta so we tried Quattro because it had really good reviews. We were not disappointed. We both ordered pasta dishes and after looking on Instagram photos they were able to recreate a mac n cheese dish that wasn't on the menu! It was flavourful and was indeed cheesy. We also ordered an appy that was a taster of their fried appies and it was all delicious and not over fried. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for pasta in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this amazing restaurant.  Everything from the bruschetta to the chocolate souffle was outstanding.  My father is very picky about his food.  He ordered the veal chop and I don't think I've ever seen him get happier with every bite.  The flavors in my veal scallopini were perfect.  The aroma of the chocolate souffle was enough to make me drool and I think I drooled even more when I ate it.  Definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever dined in."}
{"text":"\"Based upon Reviews and Price we expected more.\"  We'd had a long day walking and wanted somewhere quite close to our hotel at Place d'Armes. Quattro had decent reviews and was a block away plus we called and could get in without a wait.  If rating the food only i might have given the restaurant 3.5 or 4 stars. We had  Pappardelle-Tomato and cream sauce, Mozzarella de Buffala, prosciutto and fresh basil although my wife said that they skimped on her prosciutto  Linguini allo Scoglio -White wine, garlic, chili pepper, seafood and fresh parsley . Lots of seafood and variety in this dish more than you usually get .  However restaurant was pricey even considering we were in old montreal. At these prices food should stand out not be a check plus. If you have an upscale italian restaurant you enjoy at home eat there and try somewhere else in montreal with local flavor .  Service was poor to spotty and the decor neither elegant or intimate.      Visited July 2016"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good here, but other than that the restaurant was pretty mediocre.The atmosphere was nothing special and the food merely average. For someone who loves Italian food, I was disappointed by both the menu selection and quality of the meal.  For a city full of great restaurants, I wouldn't recommend the visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this restaurant.  We had made a reservation on a Monday night at 7pm, and by 8, it was pretty crowded in there, so it seems to be a popular place to go.  We were greeted by a friendly, older gentleman, who may have been the owner.  They brought out complimentary bruschetta and bread, which were both really good.    We started off with glasses of wine and some appetizers.  Our waiter made good recommendations for the wine based on what we were getting for our entrees.  I got the grilled calamari and my husband got the grilled octopus.  Both very good, but you HAVE to try the calamari.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked.  For our entrees, I ordered the pappardelle and my husband the filet mignon.  Wow.  My pasta was homemade and perfectly al dente, and my husband kept raving about how good and perfect the filet mignon was.  Perfectly medium rare.    To top it off, the price is very reasonable for the service, location, and quality of food.  Not cheap, but definitely worth it.  Wines by the glass were $9-13, appetizers about $15, and entrees about $25."}
{"text":"The experience was good until I found a large shard of glass in my chocolate soufflé. The manager came by and apologized but did not seem to understand how serious this could have been. I took it out of my mouth expecting it to be sugar but was horrified to see it was a large piece of glass. We were also there with a three year old and she could have been seriously hurt by it. Three year olds would not know what that was. Very disappointed. Comping a desert was not sufficient enough for me."}
{"text":"Listen, this is THE BEST italian restaurant. Ever. Ive been to many italian restaurants and it's my first time here, Very welcoming staff (I think it was the owner) It was my friends birthday so I reserved and the guy over the phone told me he'd take care of everything. We had mixed salad and penne-perfection. Cocktails, Then dessert with a sparkling candle for my girl's birthday. It looked like chocolat lava  or something and ice cream on the side..THANK U!"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant you might otherwise pass by - don't make that mistake. Exceptional Italian dinner, from start to finish (and speaking of finish, you MUST save room for the chocolate soufflé for dessert). Service was perfectly attentive without being intrusive and extremely friendly. Pasta is made fresh in house and flavors are balanced and delicious. Best meal by far of our visit to Montreal. I wish we were staying longer, so we could go back!"}
{"text":"So, getaway weekend in Montreal. We told the concierge at our hotel we were in the mood for something like Italian, he recommended Quattro Ristorante, called and made us a reservation and away we went.   We were immediately met at the door by Vince, one of the owners. He was warm, welcoming, and genuine. He took time to chat, learn our names and was a very friendly start to the night.   We ordered our meals, with input, and the food was fantastic. E had the in-house made gnocchi, I had the penne with truffle sauce and sausage, accompanied by the antipasto della casa.   Finished up with the tiramisu and the chocolate soufflé (in house made) and wow. This is an amazing place to eat. The staff, the atmosphere and the food are absolutely a must try. This place is great."}
{"text":"omgggg!! So Good!! Staff was warm and inviting as we sat down for dinner. I had made a reservation just in case but we were able to be seated right away as it was not that busy. The street Ristorante Quattro is on is super cute and filled with cool souvenir shops. I had the seafood spaghetti and i'll just say the taste was amazing because i don't think i can use the words i want to describe how all the flavors melted in my mouth. If i'm ever in Montreal again this place is a must!"}
{"text":"A New Year's Eve we'll never forget!  Nino, Vince & Frank took us in like family, for an exceptional Italian dinner--course after course of deliciousness, delivered with spunk and charm.  Just before midnight, we wandered down Notre-Dame to the fireworks, then back for desert and dancing.  Beautiful food, beautiful people, beautiful night."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a very nice time at Ristorante Quattro. Even though the ambiance left a little to be desired (we were expecting something a bit more intimate and less open/well-lit), the service was fantastic and the food was solid. I ordered an aperol spritz to start and it was a monstrous serving in a huge glass - kind of hilarious! It wasn't appropriate for the beverage but who am I to complain about extra champagne. The complimentary bruschetta to start was nothing special, but a nice gesture nonetheless. My husband got the linguine alla scoglio, which was excellent, and I got the cavatelli with speck, which was unfortunately a disappointment. The smoky flavor of the speck was overwhelming and the dish was oversalted. It was far too rich overall. We'll probably try somewhere different next time, but we'll remember our experience fondly, mostly due to the service."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to be overrated. I think three stars is a fair rating. The food was good but not great. Wait staff and decor were nice.  The selection of dishes was limited and food quality did not reflect the price reasonably.  Not worth the money. Your better off going to a cheaper place and eating just as well."}
{"text":"Saw the positive reviews and thought i should give this place a try while in town for business.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  The service was very welcoming and attentive, and we were not rushed at any point during the meal.  Everything tasted homemade, and was reasonably priced.  I would go back for the gnocchi and the roasted cauliflower soup!  Very tasty"}
{"text":"The ambience of the restaurant was warm and inviting. The owners were very friendly and engaging. And the servers were great as well.   The food was amazing. The risotto was to die for. The macaroni and cheese was the best I have ever had. And the gnocchi- their signature dish- was great.  My family and I loved the whole experience. And we will definitely go here again if we come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.... the food is decent, but the service is sub par.  Our server never came back to check on any course and we had some issues. The cocktail was awful... tasted like cough syrup.  When I asked him for something else he laughed at me like I was trash and didn't appreciate good alcohol.  However, as someone who has bartended their way through school and came out with a degree in food science; I can tell you that the melon pineapple martini is possibly the worst drink I've ever tasted.  The oysters were not served with any vinaigrette or cocktail sauce.  The entrees were okay, but very lackluster for the price.  I would have liked a salad and more water, but no one ever came back to check on us.  I'm very very disappointed, especially as I've b en sitting here waiting on a dessert menu and more water for over 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. Decided to try this place while in Montreal and really regret it. The Gnocchi which was the most recommended was horrible. It just tasted like undercooked dough. Did not have enough cheese in it and was maybe a handful. For almost $30 thats not reasonable at all. Did not like the servers as they were a bit rude and slightly insulting. Again the cesar salad was like $13 and so dry and had like one teaspoon of dressing. Also calamari is almost $20 and it has like 2 pieces. Was more disappointed than impressed. They like to cheap out on the ingredients. It was horrible and I wouldn't recommend especially for the price."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Concierge at Embassy Hotel recommended this place and made the reservation. The bruschetta that greeted our meal was spectacular. My friend had the seafood lasagna and after every bite just kept saying how great it was. My grilled calamari and the gnocchi were just as spectacular: I might have taken some of the finish off the plate because the tomato sauce was so good! Recommended it to others in group up here for the Rangers game and they all came back raving of the place. When I come back to Montreal, will definitely return here."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Montreal for a few days, and exploring it's great culinary offerings. After 3 days of heavy meat dinners, we were looking for some authentic Italian cuisine. Stumbling across Ristorante Quattro proved to be a great surprise!  We were lucky to have met Nino, the proprietor of this establishment, and right from the beginning we were welcomed and treated to great hospitality. Thank you for a great evening!  The food was amazing! We started off with the Mozzarella di Bufala. We then shared the Spaghetti Amatriciana and the Porchetta, which was also very good! Finishing with the cannoli and tiramisu was the perfect ending to a great meal and evening.  Inside tip: be sure to request some of Nino's spicy infused olive oil. It his creation, has a unique taste, and you will be happy that you did!"}
{"text":"This was good times. At approx. $50pp with drinks, a shared appetizer, and two mains, I'd say it was a good value for the quality of food and service.   We started with the roasted beets as an appetizer, which had arugula, walnut and goat cheese sprinkled on top. It was an okay dish, however, the yellow beets must have been roasted skin on because the beets were very soft. I would have preferred the beets to have been roasted skin off for a nicer texture, and it really could have complimented the soft cheese, arugula, and yes, soft walnuts. That's another thing. Toasted walnuts also could have elevated this dish. I was actually able to pick up my walnuts with a fork, which is odd. Minus one star.   As mains, I had the pappardelle and my date had the gnocchi. Both were incredible and mouth watering, and I'm not even a fan of gnocchi to begin with. I won't go into too much detail except to say that these guys know pasta like my grandmothers know pasta. Plus two stars.  There's an extensive wine menu with some pricey bottles, however they serve wines by the glass and actually have two beers on tap: Molson ex and Rickards red. Plus one star.   Service and ambiance: not typically too important to me. As long as I'm served cordially and treated well, there'll be no complaints. The service here was great. Since the resto was nearly empty, we had quite a few servers and each did their job well. They made an unintentional error on our bill by adding four coffees to our bill instead of two, and our server corrected it right away. Plus one star."}
{"text":"J'ai beaucoup aimé mon expérience au Ristorante Quattro! La majorité des pâtes (genre les tagliatelles) sont faites maison et sont délicieuses! Nous avons pris, entrée la burrata qui était divine et servie sur tomate et prosciutto avec réduction balsamique! Mon repas principale était des penne à la crème de truffes et saucisses! Wow. J'y repense et je bave encore! C'était un excellent mariage de goût! Mon copain a pris les tagliatelles sauce à la viande, et je vous dis, une des meilleures sauce que j'ai goûté! Sinon, il y a un choix de vin assez varié, une table d'hôte au prix très acceptable et un service hors pair! J'vous dis, le proprio est tellement sympathique, il fera de votre soirée un événement!!  Je le conseille fortement aux amateurs d'italien!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on a Friday night.  We made reservations about 2 hours beforehand, but it didn't seem to fill up while were there.  Regardless, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  Started off with the mozzarella and tomato salad, which was fresh, and great.  I then had the penne with lamb sausage and truffle oil.  Soooo good.  I didn't want to share any of it!  Really hit the spot on a cold night and tasted great!  Finally, waited the 13 minutes for the chocolate lava cake.. totally worth it. I would highly recommend for anyone in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Simple (but tasty) Italian food.  You can't really go wrong here, but it's a forgettable meal.  The homemade gnocchi didn't register as anything special.  They do make an excellent chocolate souffle.  Given the number of exceptional restaurants in Montreal, why settle for average?"}
{"text":"Sunday night and I was craving Italian, so I quickly  clicked on my Yelp app to find a nice Italian restaurant. Quattro had great reviews and the pictures were mouth watering. I called them up made reservations and headed downtown. Of course parking is hard to find but there is a parking lot almost next door to them (you have to pay 10$)  Went in, walls were made of brick but nice modern painting made it more up to date. Took a few minutes to get our table ready. For appetizers we ordered grilled calamari (was burnt, no seasoning)  Main dish we had pappardelle with rose sauce topped with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella cheese. (Not enough sauce, pasta was too hard very small pieces of mozzarella, portions in my opinion too small)  Also with had the linguini sea food. (It was horrible, smelled like sewage) If i had to guess was sewage would taste like I would say it would taste like that dish. Also there was sand in the oyster shells ughhhhh.  Did not stay for desert. Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"This was more on the pricey side, but after tasting the food it was all worth it! I got the Gnocci!"}
{"text":"Many of us were in Montreal for a conference and found Quattro on Yelp. Great location in old town as well. Excellent service and food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"amazing restaurant!!! Good is off the charts... Francesco and Christina are wonderful people who make your dinning experience memorable!"}
{"text":"Group of 6 out looking for a great dinner and we found it!  Francesco makes the place- funny, engaging, patient, FUN, great service and a great guy!  We were not an easy group and they were amazing with us all.  Food was first rate, service amazing. Highly recommended!! As one of the people in our group said, \"one word - Francesco\"."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for cirque du soleil kurios and visited Quattro on our way to the show. It was a perfect start to an amazing evening. Friendly, fresh, fun. We enjoyed the ambiance, welcoming host, excellent table service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Fine dining Italian restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal on Rue Notre Dame. Authentic Italian cuisine. Service was great and I also tried the champagne/frutili mixed drink. A lot of \"locals\" appeared to have stopped by for after work dinner. Reasonable busy. Very clean with great service."}
{"text":"We ended up here on a fluke Saturday night. We thought we had made reservations for Bremner but it turns out we had booked the reservation for Monday instead of Saturday. So w e needed a restaurant super last minute and something in the old port. I didn't want to go to just any restaurant. The reviews for this place online were good so we took a chance and called and luckily they had tables available. We got there at 9:30pm and I would say the restaurant was about half full.   I ordered the chardonnay and then a pinot grigio. They were both good. The waitress didn't let me try the chardonnay before she gave me my glass which I thought was unusual. But the waiter who served me the pinot grigio let me try it first but perhaps it was because I asked to try it. I do like the wines here. I tried my boyfriend's glass of red wine and it was very good. The wine menu by the glass was written on a chalk board.   They gave on small plate with two free Bruschetta. It was very good! I politely waited for my boyfriend to arrive before eating one but I think it would have been even better if I had eaten it right away because then the crunchy baguette would have been even crunchier.   We both ordered from the MTL a Table menu. My boyfriend ordered the beet soup but he didn't like it. We switched entrees but I didn't like the soup either and after awhile I gave up on trying to eat it. I'm not a big fan of beets to begin with. I only eat beet salad because its healthy.  I had ordered the salmon gravlax with red onions, fennel and capers. That was good.   For mains my boyfriend had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and melted smoked gouda cheese and I had the pork shank on a bed of pumpkin risotto. The rigatoni wasn't what I expected at all. It looked more like a lasagna to me. It was tasty though but I would have preferred it with a meat sauce and some chili flakes. The pork shank was a definite winner. The meat fell easily off the bone. The risotto was good and didn't taste like pumpkin at all. Both portions were huge which I like.  My boyfriend could not finish his rigatoni.   For dessert I had the homemade pumpkin ice cream with walnuts. It was so good! Think pumpkin spiced latte but in ice cream form! My boyfriend had the Sicilian cannoli. I honestly don't know what the difference between a Sicilian cannoli and a regular cannoli is. All I know is that there were two small cannolis on a plate. One was pistachio and the other was lemon. The pistachio was good but I didn't really enjoy the lemon one because it was too lemony for me.   For $31 for three services I felt it was worth it. Besides the beet soup the food was good. The restaurant was nicely decorated. There were tons of art on display for purchase. If I was in the area I think I would come back and try something from their regular menu like perhaps the truffle penne or maybe I would go back for some wine and some antipasti."}
{"text":"Walking into this little place I didn't know what to expect but my Italian coworker knew otherwise- he had picked the place and he only eats at excellent Italian eateries.   The owner makes this place what it is. He is very involved in the service, food recommendations, and actually serving and even making some of the food/drinks. He is dedicated to making this place a success.   I did very little of the ordering. The Italian coworker and owner did the talking and negotiating of what would enter my mouth.   First up was bruschetta, calamari, and antipasti. Mmmmmmmmm. It. Was. Fresh. A+ all around. I think the octopus had just been caught that day and the tomatoes must have been imported from Italy. So nice on the taste buds.   Main course: Braised Lamb Shank. The meat fell off the bone with a gentle touch of the knife. The sauce on the base of the plate was perfectly salted. The meat literally disintegrated in my mouth it was so tender. I would eat that lamb every night if I knew how to cook it.   Espresso for a finisher. Perfectly prepared, as expected as it was prepared by an Italian.   In summary, go here as soon as you can. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place and so happy about it. Split two pastas and a veal that could have fed a small family. Reasonable prices, friendly service, and a real homey feeling. Make sure to ask the owner for his secret hot sauce."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here a couple of weeks ago and it was the best dinner I had while in Montreal. We are from Boston and my French is quite limited. Our waitress was absolutely fabulous. She greeted us with a warm welcome and was teaching us French words and phrases throughout the evening. The owner of the restaurant was also there and he came to our table to greet us as well. He was extremely friendly and made us feel so very welcome. Amazing service aside, the food was impeccable and the wine was perfection. We started with the caprese salad and ordered the penne with sausages and risotto for dinner... I am still dreaming about that risotto!   You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't visit Ristorante Quattro while in Montreal! Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant italien. Un peu cher pour la quantité dans les assiettes et pas énormément de choix sur la carte. Service impeccable et ambiance calme et chic."}
{"text":"Très sympatique, convivial, les proprios ont l'air très charmants et empressés.  Cuisine italienne classique mais très bien exécutée, vraiment, j'y suis allé qu'une seule fois, j'ai pris le menu du jour (des pâtes) mais elles étaient excellentes en tous points.  Ce n'est pas un endroit très original mais dans le genre c'est trrrrrès correct. J'y retournerai avec des invités pour le lunch, c'est sûr. Pour le soir, je sais pas comment est l'ambiance par contre.  Les prix sont un brin élevés mais je n'ai pas l'impression de m'être fait avoir. C'était bon."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for the F1 races, so everywhere seemed to be busy.  The concierge at our hotel recommended it to us when we asked for Italian food.  We were sooo pleased!  We took a seat at the bar until our table was ready.  We were treated like royalty.  The owners were very friendly & interested in our trip.  They made great suggestions & the food was amazing.  My absolute favorite restaurant in Montreal!  We spent about 3 hours there in all but never lacked in service or food.  It was just that comfortable to be there.  From appetizers to dessert, we couldn't have asked for better.  Prices weren't bad either."}
{"text":"Really terrible service. I mean bad. Like the guy was doing us a favor to allow us to eat at his restaurant. I don't think I have ever felt so poorly after leaving a place of such perceived quality. Food almost made me sick and took hours which felt like it was on purpose.   Go burn 200$ for two somewhere worth your money."}
{"text":"Having out of town guests visiting I ventured to this lovely old Montreal Ristorante to sample their offerings.  It was a Tuesday night so I called last minute to see if a table of four was possible and was told that  they would be happy to set one aside.  We arrived and lucked into the best table in the place in the window, just off the bar, a cozy little nook indeed.  The place is very big with high ceilings and when we walked in we were immediately greeted by a gentleman by the name of Francesco. Water was brought to our table and he asked us if we wanted to start with drinks or if we prefer wine.  We paused for a second to consider, we had just had cocktails, but decided to try another, so I asked our new found friend for a suggestion and he said, the signora must try a house cocktail made of Prosecco and ?, (I think the something was an Italian Amperol, but he called it by another name, I cannot remember, he mentioned it was harder to find), whatever the brand, it was delish.    The next thing we got was the bread and olive oil/balsamic dip and four really good bruschettas, off to a promising start.....   We then ordered some apps, Polpo ai ferri, Mozzarella di Bufala, Pappardelle with rose sauce more Mozzarella di Buffala, prosciutto and fresh basil, and an Insalata Cesare with extra anchovies.  The octopus was one of the best ever, grilled with what we could have sworn was wood, it's smoky flavor was awesome and  it melted on the tongue, it was served with paper thin slicesof onion, capers and garbanzo beans. The tomato and buffala salad was also perfect with fat juicy tomato slices, very fresh cheese a sprinkle of shredded basil and just the right amount of drizzled oil and balsamic.  The Cesar salad was well balanced, and with a made from scratch dressing, which again was the perfect amount, and no anchovies were left behind!  The parpadelle was a huge hit, they must make their pasta in house. the toothiness of the pasta was so good you could really appreciate it on it's own, but the light sauce and fixing made this a symphony of taste to enjoy.  I would reorder this as a main anytime.  We then went in for the kill, mains were 2 Costoletta di Vitello, for the gents and the fish of the day (Grilled swordfish) and another dish of the day, Veal scallopini, spinacci, grapes and pine nuts and an extra center dish of Penne Sauce à la crème de truffles et saucisses. .   They know their food prep, the veal was a ting a beauty I tell ya.  Perfectly grilled on the outside but delicately pink and moist at the center, it was a very generous portion which led us to believe it would get wrapped up, but by the end of the evening everyone had happily noshed their way until nothing but bone was left, sorry puppies no leftover for you! I did not really try the fish (because I had too much already), but was told by my 3 other dining mates that it was really just as good as all the rest.  My main was the veal with spinach, the sweet white grapes gave the sauce a rich sweetness, that balanced really well with the salty spinach and lovely roasted fingerling potatoes (found in each dish and consumed with great pleasure).  The pasta was even better than anyone could have hoped, and we devoured it like people who were deprived of food (considering the volumes of food available this is no mere feat), this too is a must repeat.  We ordered some very good red ,which I can't name because  we drank two bottles after all those cocktails so something has to give. I remember describing it's bite to corduroy, and somehow this was generally accepted by all at the table and we were surprised that this would be a good thing, but I digress.  By the end of the evening we had met the other owner Vincenzo, and were  told the third of this trio was on vacation.  (in case you can count in Italian, yes their was a fourth but he left after one month, so while the name is still there it is a trio), they were charming to a fault, pros at their vocation, and  masters at the art of picking, preparing,creating, and serving up fine food and hospitality.  They happily chatted us up about various common places we knew from Italia, we talked shop, we laughed we cried, it was real.  So add this to my roster as a sure bet for a night to remember.....  oh darn quick update, when I used the ladies room I saw the bestest thing eva, they have a huge floss dispenser available to clients, so smart, I wonder if one of the owners was a dentist in another life!"}
