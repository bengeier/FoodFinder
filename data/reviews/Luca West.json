{"text":"My wife and I live in Avon and I can say without a doubt this is THE best restaurant in a 10+ mile radius of us and one of the best restaurants we have been to in Cleveland. From the authentic decor (most of which we were told was from Italy), to the exceptional service and most importantly the wine list and food menu were beyond excellent. We loved our appetizer and our main course; everything else on the menu looks just as enjoyable and we plan on trying in future visits. True northern Italian cooking.   For your next nice meal in the Westlake/Avon/Cleveland Westside area I would HIGHLY recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We came here for date night and were not disappointed.  From decor is modern Italian farmhouse. Modern but comfortable.  The staff is very attentive but not intrusive.   The appetizers are plentiful, so much so that we had leftovers.   The bread and oil was delicious.  I had the gnocchi and he had the lamb. Both were outstanding.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner,  and then went to the bar after dinner.  Good drinks but very strong.  So much so that I couldn't finish them!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dec29,2017 Yes service was great. However for the price of the food the portions were small. The atmosphere is too noisy and loud accustic speaking. I got short ribs and they were good but cold and three finger type slices of potatoes and two aspergus for $30 dollars . someone got scallops they got five small ones and some one got sea bass and it was small. I don't mind paying the price for adequate meals but it just wasn't worth it . Not a Westlake type restaurant to me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant on the west side of Cleveland. The interior is very well redesigned. The gnocchi and ravioli were both absolutely incredible. This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pricey but good. Pasta is delicious and service was on point. After meal Keoke Coffee was amazing and needed after gorging on so much delicious pasta."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sunday Happy Hour all evening! Great service, drinks and food. Ordered mussels, calamari, caprese salad, bolognese, orecchiette with sausage. The desserts were wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Should have been a five but I am mirroring an earlier comment. Service was off putting. 3 of 4 entrees came out on time and we waited, and waited for the final one.  No dice. We had to send everything back since the others had grown cold by then. They were brought back out and they were still cold except for the 4 th. Sent back again now half our party was eating and half were waiting. Manager came over admitted error and offered only to buy us free desert. It was a classic kitchen,service, runners screw up. The whole thing should have been on them. And this place is expensive. Only reason for two stars is the patio was nice."}
{"text":"There seems to be a little confusion between the bartender outside and the front people.  The bartender outside would not wait on me if I sat at a table in the bar area. But finally someone else came outside to wait on me.  Due to confusion with the people I was meeting I went inside and service in the bar area was great but slow.  The happy hour food is outstanding and so generous!  I ordered a wine about a minute after happy hour, but the owner gave me the happy hour price!  I will definitely come back again without my friends because the outside bar is so much better than inside which is a little dark."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:15 to find the place crowded. Nobody was assigned to our table until after 30 minutes we made a comment. Then it took 30 more minutes to take our orders. Food arrived at 9:10!! Table side filleting of bream was silly and he left bones in it. We sent one serving back as it tasted horrible. Overall the rest of the food was excellent.  The manager made no attempt to offset our complaints. One can only conclude that he is incompetent."}
{"text":"Superb evening to sum up my recent birthday dinner at Luca West.   The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is absolute perfection. Clean, warm, and contemporary sophisticate vibe. Also, the oil lamps on the table are fricking awesome to play around wi-I mean, adjust to your personal table lighting preferences.  The food was delicious and my leftovers were just as good the next day. The duck was tender and complete with a savory barley side and a perfectly spiced berry reduction.   As an added touch to the already pleasant  service, I received a complementary tiramisu dessert and even a photograph for my birthday! Super bougie experience!...*hairflip*"}
{"text":"Really fantastic restaurant and exactly what the west side has been missing! Great location, great bar, amazing food and plenty of parking! Highly recommend! Have been here twice now and am looking forward to a third time this evening!"}
{"text":"We ate there on a beautiful night to sit on the patio.  There were 2 of us and there were many tables empty.  The boy seating us put us at the worse table on the entire patio.  My husband faced the kitchen which was a foot or two away.  I told the boy we did not want to sit there and he said we can't have a table for 4.  When we were ready to leave, there were still many empty tables and he had put other couples in a table of 4 after we sat down.  Our waiter said that is not their policy and he should have never done that.  The evening was ruined by this awful table.  We should have left and were sorry we didn't.  Other than that, our food was delicious."}
{"text":"Took forever to be seated for our 7:30 reservation of 8 people.  We were finally seated at 8:10.  Service was slow and unorganized at best.  Our meal order was taken quickly but food took forever to be served.  The grouper was rubbery and seemed to be reheated in a microwave or under a heat lamp for some time.  We finally finished our dining experience around 10:15 pm.   Do not plan on revisiting this establishment"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night, I really really really wanted to love it. But didn't.  The patio is fantastic!   There seems to be plenty of waitstaff although we had a hard time keeping our waiter focused for service.   Another gentleman took and brought some bread which was delicious -my cocktail  Took forever.   My husband ordered the short ribs which I will give the presentation 1 although the flavor was quite good.  It was all taking so long I decided to stick with A salad and have some of my husband short ribs.  I ordered a salad with Gorgonzola cheese, pears and walnuts-  The most flavorless waterlogged salad I've ever had in my life. They must have sold a pear strips in water and the lettuce was wet. There was one small piece of Gorgonzola cheese for $12 I expected a bit more.    Maybe worth a happy hour during the week but on weekends they do not offer Half orders of pasta and everything seemed very heavy with lots of cheese and cream, not my thing."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, beautiful interior. The only reason this isn't a five star review is because we can't help but compare Luca West to Luca and a view of a parking lot is never going to beat a view of the downtown skyline. If you're a west sider I would definitely recommend this location though. Although we were hoping to see the sachetti w fig sauce from the original location on the menu (this dish is in the top 10 best things I've ever ate list). The Tortellini i had instead had plenty of lobster and shrimp and was delicious. The tomato cream sauce managed to  be fresh and not too heavy. The filet was good but holy hold the peppercorns - way too much pepper. This place has only been open 2 weeks but we would have never known they were so new - service was flawless and friendly."}
{"text":"Luca West supposedly has a nice happy hour.  I'd give them and  their  manager a minus 5 or zero  if it was possible.  Stay away.  It's a poorly run restaurant.   We have been intending to go for a couple of weeks to try them out for a happy hour.  Today we decided to give it a try.  Today is Father's Day, so I called Saturday night, twice Sunday before 5 and twice Sunday after 5pm.  The menu only states happy hour is 5-9pm on Sunday.  It does not have any exclusions for holidays or special events.   We were a bit wary of going after no one answering the phone.  I left 3 voice messages for them to call me and of course they never did or I wouldn't be writing this.    We arrived at 7pm to get a table for a group of 8 of us.  The outdoor patio had a bartender 3 tables and an empty bar.  It has a large patio and bar.  It was totally dead. The large inside bar had nobody other than a bartender.   I inquired at the  inside bar about Sunday Happy Hour and was told there wasn't any.    From the bartender and manage I found out that there were multiple parties similarly disappointed.   My wife stormed out to call our friends to tell them to head to our house for happy hour and light food.  I went back in to talk to the manager who was clueless on how to run a restaurant or customer service.  You either answer your phone or return calls.  Blaming it on a hostess that didn't come in to Work was a pitiful excuse.  Any true leader should take responsibility for their failures and commend their staff for successes.  In the ridiculous case this happens to the restaurant you take care of the guests immediately anyway you can to make it right.   Nothing was done by the manager to even try to rectify and take care of his guests.    It appeared that his poor management also extended to the dining room as he was helping to wait tables.  Likely another oversight for having adequate staffing to provide proper service.    Until they can run a restaurant, answer the phone, and provide service, I suggest that everyone stays away."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but service was slow and prices are VERY HIGH.   Wine list was extensive and very expensive. There is a very subtle arrogance among the wait staff that was off putting to our group.   Basically the food and services did not come close to the price tag. Will not return.   Too many other options on the Westside of Cleveland where value is better."}
{"text":"Went to Luca W for our anniversary. Brought our young adult children along for the celebration. What an enjoyable evening. Service was top notch. Many choices of fast appetizers and dinners. Graced us with a picture and a tiramisu. My don's steak was a beautiful looking entree. My halibut was tasty and the arugula salad perfect. The servings allowed us to feed the kids the next day as well. Really a great memory for our family."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and the atmosphere was very nice. Great place for a chill relaxing dinner. Service was exceptional from the hostess to the servers. Nice cocktail and wine selection. The mojito I had was spot on. As far as food, I had the pappardelle which was quite nice. Cannolis and tiramisu were excellent as well."}
{"text":"I attended a private happy hour event here yesterday. It was fabulous! The decor is gorgeous, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the food and drinks are incredible. I ordered the calamari and it was sauteed, not breaded, which I prefer. I heard many others raving about their food. It was a delightful experience and I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"First, my rating of 4 of 5 is excellent.  I rarely give out 5 because after that, there's no where to go.  So please understand 4 stars is outstanding.  I don't like people who over-inflate ratings.    We celebrated my mother's birthday here.  Since I live in Chicago, my aunt suggested this place.  Don't let the office building location fool you,  the interior is absolutely perfect.  It's a very cozy, warm, inviting but simple decor that really is conducive to dining and conversation.  Few get the simple decor but warm atmosphere proportions correct.  They did it right. Lighting is perfect too, all important to really setting the tone for a fun evening.   The wine selection is considerable.  A bit on the pricey side. They could choose some more reasonably priced for a broader range. Even the James Beard award restaurants in Chicago have a variety wines from less expensive to the more expensive wines.  For a cocktail, I ordered an Aviator (from Sasha Petraske's famous book, \"Regarding Cocktails\"), and it was excellent. Difficult to get the proportions right since there's some subtle flavors there, but it was perfect, and beautifully presented.   The carpaccio as an appetizer was very good.  The quality of the beef was there. However there  weren't enough capers served which is essential in carpaccio and it could have done with a drizzle of olive oil. The house bread which they expected you to use was  also excellent, but for carpaccio, was too thickly sliced to get the portions  correct (too much bread).   I had the server pick my meal. It forces me to broaden my horizons. She chose the short ribs and they were nothing short of perfect. Moist, juicy, flavorful. The potatoes served with it weren't mushy and gave a great texture to the whole plate. It was a great warm meal for a cold Cleveland evening. My guests had the filet, and it was likely the best filet mignon I have tasted (remember, I live in the steak capital of the country, Chicago). It was juicy and flavorful, a result hard to achieve on a cut of meat with no marbling or fat. Others had the tortelloni with lobster and though I didn't taste it, they raved about it. The sauce I'm told was exceptional, with plenty of lobster and shrimp.  The restaurant chose simple, white, but contemporary styled dinnerware and plates.  These details really do lend to an exceptional experience since it shows off the food.   For a birthday, they did bring mom a slice of tiramisu and while it's hard to screw up tiramisu, it really was vey good. Plenty of sabayon between the lady fingers, and very creamy.  I had the pannacotta. I make it a rule to always order pannacotta if I see it on the menu because it's rare to see this quintessential Roman dessert on a menu.  Rarer still to do it right. They did it perfectly.  It was thick and \"custardy\" without being dry.  I didn't care for the cinnamon in it, but that's just my prejudice against cinnamon. It was served with a strawberry sauce which was perfect.   I have to thank the owners and staff for a really great evening. The service was good, the food was great, and the ambience is AMAZING. When I'm back in town, I'll be back here, that's a certainty."}
