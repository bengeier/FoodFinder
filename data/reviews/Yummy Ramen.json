{"text":"COCKROACHES!! FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH DO NOT EAT HERE!!  I came to this place on the second floor of Pacific Mall. Clearly the people running the store do not care what is in their food.   I ordered their tenderous ribs ramen. Halfway through the bowl a boiled cockroach floated up to the surface. I brought the bowl back to the lady at the counter,  explained and showed her that there was a cockroack in my ramen. She was not surprised, gave no comment and had no reaction... and then proceeds to ask, what's wrong with it, as if everything is ok. I explained to her that cockroaches can be very dirty and there is a cockroach in my bowl and that it is NOT OK to serve food like this. She then asked ME to take the bowl to the middle foodcourt garbage can and throw it out.   She couldn't be bothered lift a finger, not even to handle the bowl of ramen herself but worst of all, NOT EVEN TO TELL THE KITCHEN that was right behind her to double check their food. Not once did she apologize.  In the end, she did give me a refund without much resistance but her unapologetic attitude and their disregard for cleanliness make me recommend that you stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Pretty poor ramen, even for food court fare.  Over-cooked noodles and weak, tasteless broth.  Not expensive but not worth it."}
{"text":"Meh! The combo picture on the flyer makes their food look much better than it really is. My combo A came out 7 minutes later and the presentation and look was nothing like the image. You get take out style plastic bowl and wooden chopsticks. The food itself is drowned in watery instant noodle-like broth. You dig in and see two corn kernels. You find the pork slices and noticed how thin they are. Tasty, but thin. What makes a good ramen meal is the broth. This was far from anything other than instant noodle pack with meat. I did get the chicken wings as my side and it was good. The wings were tiny but fried and seasoned very nicely. Lady at the front was friendly. I'd skip it had I known the outcome."}
{"text":"Ramen smaller than you would think. Not worth the money, might as well go to ajisen to enjoy good ramen. Would rate 1 star for service"}
{"text":"We were hungry and looking for some Japanese ramen and we found this place in Pacific Mall's food court upstairs. They have a ramen + snack combo for $11.99 so it was a decent deal. They don't give you much toppings and it's mostly ramen. So, if you're hungry, you'll enjoy it, but if you wanted more meat, they could do better.  We tried a Combo A: Cha siu ramen + Popcorn chicken and a tenderous rib ramen. Definitely enjoyed the ribs more than the cha siu, and the popcorn chicken had some spice to it, but flavour wise it doesn't compare to the chicken you can get at Papa Chang's nearby. You'll be better off getting the chicken there.  The ramen itself isn't special, if you want noodles you should get the hand pulled noodles a few stalls down. You can't miss it because it's the busiest one with a crowd watching the people pull the noodles.  Anyways, if you're hungry you can eat here and you'll be full, but I feel something like Ajisen is better if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some lamb skewers because our usual place, on the corner, seems to have closed down.  The price was $9.99 for 8, which seemed a good deal.  However, they were the skinniest and shortest lamb sticks that I have ever seen.  The flavour was good but definitely not worth the price.  I wouldn't come here ever again for skewers."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come for ramen, but the curry chicken special $4.90 including tax is pretty affordable and tasty here.  This meal came with a seaweed soup and although the person told me to wait five minutes, it was roughly a ten minute wait. I think it's because they cook it again perhaps as opposed to reheating it, or if they reheated it, it's pretty hot.  There was a ton of curry sauce and it wasn't too spicy. The curry sauce reminds me of those in the Japanese packets. It didn't have a lot of carrot slices or broccoli, which I would appreciate if they had more. The amount of sauce was just enough for the rice. The chicken was pretty decent too. I think I barely found one potato in this dish.   Overall, the food was okay. It's not top notch quality, but for $4.90, I had a decent and large boxed lunch here."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 1.5 rating at most. First of all, I advise everyone to stay away from their ramen. Not only is it mediocre BUT you can seriously get an upset stomach. No joke. The first time I tried it, my stomach immediately started rumbling like crazy. It was like a fiesta. I thought okay maybe it's just me. But the second time I KNOW FOR SURE ITS THEIR RAMEN STIRRING UP A STORM IN MY STOMACH so yeah stay the fk away from their ramen.   One thing that is good from them (and doesn't kill my stomach ) is their fujian style wonton and braised noodle. It's actually pretty damn good. (But the soup of the wonton is PROBABLY MSG OVERLOAD anyways)   **update: your stomach might actually hurt a little cause my sure fkin do now   ****im never gonna come here again NEVER. I SHALL NOT BURDEN MY STOMACH ANY FURTHER IT DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS"}
{"text":"Got their potato curry and it was nothing like it looked in the picture. There was maybe 3 small potatoes, barely any carrots (which was pictured) and the curry itself was a little too thick and just didn't taste very good. It also came with soup which literally tasted like salt water so I ended up throwing that away. The service was also pretty slow, I waited probably 10 minutes for my simple order. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because I remember trying their vegetarian ramen a while back and it was decent (or maybe I was just hungry at the time). There are much better food places in pmall."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I try to avoid when I come to Pacific Mall as the girl leans over the counter and yells at you to come take a look at their menu.  As I didn't want to run across the street to get cash I decided to give this place a try as it seemed like they were the only one to accept debit.  I got the: 1. Chicken Cutlet with Vermicelli - The chicken cutlet was okay ... but the strips were very thin and it was very chewy; like they fried a bunch of fat - The vermicelli was so tasteless in the soup, I literally made my bowl red with the chili oil trying to get some flavour 2. Tender Ribs with Sweet Potato Noodle and Chicken Wings - My boyfriend enjoyed the ribs  - The chicken wings were small (5 pieces) but fried nicely - The potato noodles were no good in my opinion; the broth was bland as well They also got the orders mixed up between the bowls as I got the sweet potato noodles with the chicken cutlet and the tender ribs came with the vermicelli. ???????  Overall, it was not worth the price nor my tastebuds ):"}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Another ramen place that advertises serving \"authentic\" ramen opened inside the food court area of Pacific Heritage Town.  Yummy Ramen worth a try as it is having a Grand Opening Special: 20% off and with a free large Presotea if you spend over $10 before tax.  We shared Tenderous Ribs Ramen ($8.99) and Salt Pepper Chicken ($3.99). The Chicken tasted old and oily. The Ramen was not bad, the soup base was surprisingly light and the noodle was cooked with a good bite.  In a food court setting, I don't think it is really worth the full price they are charging!   There is also Northern Style bbq skewers on the menu. Yummy Ramen just kind of confusing!"}
{"text":"4 days later, and I'm still trying to figure out what piece of the chicken I was eating. I had already had my ramen fix the night before, and opted to get the chicken curry which was presented nicely... the taste was just...yeeeeeeuuuuck. It definitely tasted like Glico's mild curry mix, but it was just super lack lustre and made me aware that the presentation was intended to compensate for the deplorable cooking. The chicken was...gummy, if you can believe it. It was served with what I *think* was supposed to be miso soup but was clear with seaweed and tasted like boiled fish bones. No miso taste in sight to balance out the complexity of a proper dashi stock: it definitely wasn't made from katsuobushi.   My boyfriend got the tonkotsu ramen which was even more appalling. Lifeless noodles with no bounce to them, and pork that looked like it had been cooked 5 days ago.   Do not be suckered in by the friendly girl at the counter shoving (I mean that politely) a menu in your face."}
{"text":"Went here for ramen the other day. I had the fried chicken + Pork bone ramen combo. The chicken was alright, crispy, moist inside. The ramen soup base was just disappointing, just because it has the looks but taste are just absent."}
{"text":"The ramen was below average, the egg was just half a hard boiled egg not the Japanese soft boiled egg as shown in the pictures on the menu. The fried chicken in comparison was much better, the seasoning on the outside was really good."}
{"text":"This rating is only for their crispy squid tentacles and deep fried popcorn chicken.   Their ramen is okay but not great. A 2.5 rating."}
