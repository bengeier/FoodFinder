{"text":"The Vic is a precious new gem in the West Valley.  The level of quality is unmatched in this area.  Delicious fresh food prepared with in an environment of casual elegance.  I believe this is the highest point in the West Valley which provides an unobstructed view across the entire valley.  The sun sets over the mountains in the background providing a dining setting that is unique, relaxing and memorable.  Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Great place with beautiful views! Live music outside, attentive staff and amazing food! We had the DYNAMITE fish sandwich, and it was just that, dynamite! Mushroom soup was tasty took It's also comforting to visit a place where the manager is walking around, asking and answering questions, and making sure the food is perfect before it is sent to the table. We watched her checking every plate, correcting anything wrong and asking for servers to take the food quickly so it didn't get cold. Very cool experience. Not your average restaraunt."}
{"text":"We have been to the Vic multiple times, and it seems to very on how service is. But more recently they have closed off areas with signs that say members only, which I think is ridiculous because my blind father could find the bathrooms when they weren't blocked off. Now he has to go outside to go inside where the ambassadors are, and they didn't help him find the bathroom so he was wandering around trying to find it himself. The restaurant isn't friendly to kids or handicapped people. I went there with my husband, daughter and son in law (we had been here plenty of times before and the food was great.) this time the food was cold, and the wait staff was nowhere to be found when our food was up, which resulted in us having cold fries so I ordered more (which got served cold also). The other times we had gone up there it was great, food was hot, fries were crispy, and desserts were wonderful. My family and I have decided the only reason we will go up there again is for dessert, because personally we all love the dessert, and we have talked to the pastry chef Lauren, and she is wonderful."}
{"text":"As a local, I have come to rely on The Vic for a morning chat over coffee or breakfast with out of town guests or the Mrs. The ambiance is perfect and because this place is on top of a hill- views are sensational for the west valley (see pics).
The house coffee is amazing and I had to inquire what grounds they use. The breakfast quality and food portion is good. The Mgr. Matt is always hospitable. This is an impartial review as I, sometimes unfortunately, am always going to be brutally candid."}
{"text":"The Pros:
Beautiful setting
Beautiful architecture
Great view
Very tasteful design
Good menu choices

The Cons:
Bun on burger dry, maybe stale and a bit small for the burger
Slow service
Very dark on patio until they put down umbrellas blocking the lights right before we left
Dry chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream was tasteless
Very nice server but couldn't make the bill come out correctly after 3 tries

Probably would go back but only for ambience, no other reason"}
{"text":"Just forget it. I have given this place enough tries. I always walk out unsatisfied.  Only thing good is a drink.  The waiter was so uninformed, our carne asada tacos were like jerky and the chef said they were supposed to be charred.  So charred you couldn't bite or chew it. No misting system outside. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"The Vic Bar and Kitchen is a new farm to table restaurant in the west valley. It's the brain child of DMB who developed Silverleaf, Eastmark and Marley Park.  For a new restaurant, they really have their stuff together. The staff really care about what they are doing, they're knowledgeable and accommodating. Three different managers stopped by to say hello and thank us for visiting (Saturday night). We are looking forward to returning soon. By the way; the views are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I guess the third time is the charm. Came in today they had 4 bartenders working, no one at the bar and still took over 10 minutes to get waited on.  DMB has no idea how to run a restaurant. Manager finally did come around to apologize"}
{"text":"This review is written with the following caveat--it's a new place, and they are still figuring a few things out. But, I'm not going to hold that against them right now. If they continue to have growing pains, then I'll have to revisit this review. That said, let's talk about the place. 
I've been able to go to the Vic three times now. Once for dinner, once for lunch, and once just for drinks. I really enjoy the atmosphere. Day or night, the layout of the restaurant and surrounding grounds is outstanding. At night, the view across the West Valley is incredible, and unlike anywhere else. 
The menu is different. In some cases, very different. I found that it let me try a few different flavors and things that I wouldn't have otherwise tried. Some were good, some were just ok. I imagine that the menu will continue to change and evolve over time as they find what works and what doesn't. 
The service is a bit chaotic at times, but they handled what we needed. If you're in a hurry, it may be a problem for you, but I was just enjoying the space and my company, so I had no complaints there. I know that once the kinks get ironed out, they'll get a system and take care of people in a quicker and more consistent manner. 
Finally, the cost is pretty high. You're obviously paying for the atmosphere and location. The menu, as eclectic as it is, is not filled with items from a simple grocery store, so those ingredients will be a little more expensive. It is not cheap. Food isn't very cheap. Drinks are not cheap. But, when I want cheaper, I'll go to Denny's. When I want more of an experience, I'll pay the price and go to a place like The Vic."}
{"text":"The Vic Bar & kitchen is wonderful , yup off the beaten path a little but that makes all the better . The view is beautiful & The food was spot on... the service is  very friendly & attentive. Angela helped me with some recommends on the menu as well as the surrounding area. I have been back a few times & recommend it to anyone in Phoniex or visiting .  - Mike"}
{"text":"I've dined at the Vic twice and and while the wait service was attentive and friendly, the food was disappointing.  I brought my family to brunch yesterday and we were able to sample a variety of dishes.  

Best - salted caramel pancakes, BLT.

Worst - breakfast ramen.  Do.not.go.there. Thick and overly salty broth described as \"like eating pan drippings\" with noodles. The worst attempt at ramen I've ever experienced. Taste buds insulted.

I've had the shrimp and grits twice, and it was weak this time around. 

I would return to the Vic for a drink and the views but not the food."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but the only pleasant thing about our first experience here was dealing with the assistant manager. This is definitely not a family friendly place if you have younger children. We realized that when we were given a choice of squeezing 6 of us (2 adults and 4 kids) into a small booth or sitting outside in the cold when there were 2 larger tables available inside. While going outside to sit, we asked for a heat lamp and were told there were no more, but then a group of 4 who were sat outside a minute after us were promptly provided with a heat lamp. After about 10 minutes, the assistant manager came by and brought us a heat lamp, but the mood was already set. 
We decided to go ahead and order. There was only one pasta dish on the menu, again not kid friendly, so I ordered it but just asked for the fettuccine to be tossed in butter and cheese. I asked her for 2 extra plates. The server looked at me confused. I explained that 3 of the girls wanted to share it, but just with butter and cheese, that they wouldn't eat it with all the other stuff In it. She said she would check and see if she could do that. We also ordered the burger and the chicken wrap. The assistant manager checked on us again and brought a second heat lamp as everyone else had now left the patio.
Our food came out and that's when everything from the evening came to a crashing end. They brought out a tiny bowl of pasta with one extra bowl and our burger and chicken wrap. I asked how the one tiny bowl could possible cost $18 and feed 3 kids. The server said she ordered a kids portion since it was for kids. Even when we've had mishaps at other places, we've always just eaten, paid and then not gone back if it was a bad experience. My husband has NEVER gotten angry at a restaurant until tonight. We let the kids eat the pasta and the burger that they brought out and then left. The assistant manager offered to comp our meal, but my husband insisted on paying since the kids ate 2 of the 3 meals. 
I can't rate the food, because we didn't get to eat. I've worked in the industry, so I understand mishaps, miscommunication, etc. this was none of that. Again, the assistant manager was very nice, but we shouldn't have had to meet him under those circumstances. There needs to be some serious retraining of the staff and either tell patrons that this is not a kid friendly place, or make it a kid friendly place with a kid menu. As for us, we will stick with dining at the Verrado Grill where we have had years of wonderful family meals."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Everyone is friendly. Service is great. Everything was prepared with care and exactly to my specifications. Excellent pricing for what we had. Love the Vic burger. The asparagus tips and green goddess sauce was top shelf. Gorgeous scenery and awesome coffee. Nothing but praise for this place."}
{"text":"This place is a winner for me! Loved the view of the mountains and pool setting. Food was absolutely delicious I had the cured meat flatbread and huckleberry 43 to drink... The staff was very friendly but the best part was that the manager seemed super friendly and checked up on us regularly, just shows how much they care that you have a good experience."}
{"text":"I so want to love this place. Great ambiance and views. The first time we went, my daughter's burger came out medium rare when she asked for well done. French fry portion is small. While we were there you could tell there was some confusion with seating and getting people served. I thought I would give it another try for lunch. When we asked for outside seating the hostess gave us a funny look and said she just seated her last outside table like she was frustrated. We were able to sit outside on the other side right outside the open window. They have a fan on that was blasting us. When we asked if it could be tuned down, the manager wasn't very nice or pleasant. My salad came out with rotten avocado on it. How did that pass by the cook who prepared it and the person who served it to me?  It took a few minutes to find staff to show them. One girl said she would get her manager. He was behind the bar making a drink and took a while for him to show up. He said the avocado was bruised. He was making excuses instead of providing customer service. Just apologize and make it better, don't argue with the customers. Look at the picture above of the salad. The salad had too much dressing too. I think my \"greens\" consisted of iceberg lettuce. My friend's grilled cheese was good but small portion.  As for the iced tea, you have to keep asking for a refill in which they take your glass away to refill. What is wrong with having a ready pitcher of tea? They really need to work out the kinks and teach everyone about good customer service especially the male manager."}
{"text":"Fantastic anniversary dinner!   Food was amazing and the view was breathtaking!   Hubby ordered filet mignon and it was cooked perfect.  He said it melted in his mouth and he is hard to please.  Our service was five stars and our waitress Carly spoiled us!   It was our first time here and we it was recommended by a neighbor.  Great date night spot with fantastic wines and food.  Can't wait to try the Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"I wish they stayed open later and had a larger under 55 clientele, but the menu and atmosphere are awesome. A nice little getaway spot with some decent scenery. I think this place has great potential."}
{"text":"Walked in, sat at the bar to have some lunch. Watched 11 employees walk around and make no eye contact with any of the 5 parties that were there at the time.  I sat there for 10 minutes. Never was greeted. Left. It's really too bad. Could be so much more."}
{"text":"You have to be kidding me, a place like this in the west Valley I thought this only existed somewhere more high end wow!!! The best view in the west Valley that's to say the least now the food that's what whole different ball game your mouth cannot phantom the flavor excitement it gets when tasting dishes that are fresh and hand crafted especially when they have ingredients that are grown right here in our backyard the wonderful desert of Arizona. Every item on the menu has its own beauty texture and taste if you are a real and true foodie please please come check out the Vic from extraordinary drinks to deconstructed Foods this place is going places fast"}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks there last night food was great and the bartender Kelly and Stacy were really great"}
{"text":"After spending a long afternoon house hunting in Verrado, it was recommended that we stop into The Vic and we were hungry.   We were so disappointed with the mushroom appetizer, hamburger and BLT sandwich.  There may be an audience for tiny plate food described to impress you, but this is not Washington DC and this neighborhood needs a restaurant that serves the people and their guests that live here.  Trying to \"jazz up\" a small dry entree with exotic ingredients just for the sake of saying you are \"farm to table\" or that your food is so special is what this pretentious phony place is all about. What a shame, since the setting is so spectacular this place feels they don't have to try in any way to serve tasty food, decent portions and fair prices.  We visit our clubhouse twice a week to drink and dine and we thought we would be blown away by this place.  How could we live at Victory and not have a restaurant to enjoy and treat our family to in such a glorious setting?   This restaurant should have been packed and yet it wasnt, what does that tell you?  Change is needed, not apologies. Please realize there are a lot of negative reviews for the food and service and someone needs to pay attention, revamp the menu and make this place THE place to go to regularly."}
{"text":"The fare is fabulous and the panoramic mountain views are even better. Located in Verrado, this lovely little gem features a fabulous new menu with the changing seasons. They buy their food from local farmers so everything is always fresh. They offer a great bar scene with lots of cocktail options created by their ingenious mixologists. Whether you go for a meal or just a drink with friends, this place offers incredible (indoor/outdoor) views of the Phoenix skyline and mountains, and the service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"First off let me say view is stunning... however, service is lacking ( and that's me just being nice).. sat out on patio. A group of 6 of us. Menu not friendly... I'm not thrilled about bone marrow to eat... everyone we saw eating was having either a fish sandwich or a burger... how about putting some filet or something people actually want to eat on ur menu? Waitress completely incompetent (again being nice). Not a good experience we walked out after one drink..."}
{"text":"We went to the Vic with another couple for dinner last Friday, September 16th.  We read the reviews and some were not so great, but we thought that maybe it was because they had just opened; we were hoping they had ironed out the kinks.  Guess what, they have not.  Someone said this place was \"swanky\" in their review and I am shocked, although the bar stools were nice.

We had a reservation for 4, were seated and sat there for quite a while without anyone stopping by the table.  A gentleman who introduced himself as the Club Manager approached our table and asked if he could help, he was pleasant and attempted to take our drink orders when our waiter finally showed up.  We were told we were in good hands, we were not.  The waiter took our drink order and I had ordered a smokey mango margarita and he came back and told me they couldn't make it because they were out of mangos.  The Club Manager came back by and said that he had ordered us a couple of appetizers, trying to right a wrong and we do appreciate his effort.

We had the candied bacon, which was great...that's where the great ended.  The thai flatbread had so much cilantro on it that you couldn't see the ingredients underneath, seriously overkill.  Waiter asked for our dinner order and my husband asked if there was a special entrée and we were told no, only dessert and he didn't elaborate on that.  My husband inquired about the fish choice that was nondescript on the menu and said \"market price\", the waiter tried to explain the fish as a cross between salmon and halibut but \"chewier\".  What, that doesn't sound appetizing but I bit and asked how it was prepared, he said, \"I don't know, let me go ask\".  Again, seriously?!  He came back and said, \"with some fruit, pineapple\".  We ordered the lemon chicken, flat steak, BLT and the fish sandwich.

The meals came and they were all awful, we have never had 4 strike outs so this was a first.  The waiter came by to see how things were, but it was clear he wasn't really interested.  Our friend said his lemon chicken had a lot of gristle and bones, he asked if he wanted to talk to the chef, we passed because we didn't have anything nice to say and the waiter turned and left.  The flank steak was chewy and not flavorful, the BLT was weak with no mayo, aioli or any sauce on the bread and the fish sandwich was so bland and blah I didn't waste the calories to eat it.  The fries were ok.

To sum it up, the Vic has hit a homerun in the disappointment category and provided a couple of first, horrible service and truly awful meals.  Please heed the reviews unless Kitchen Nightmares revamps this place, it's a zero."}
{"text":"Love this place, my new favorite in the west valley.

Burger is amazing...patty ground in house, bun, pickles and sauce all made here, cool.

Huntsman is my new favorite cocktail.

Deviled local duck egg is amazing and they carry Crows dairy products.

Love that they support local products."}
{"text":"Getting better after a rough start.  The new manager Matt is getting things done and it shows.  Keep up the good work because this place has a huge upside.  Best views of all the restaurants in Verrado, but that's what you pay the extra money for.  Worth a visit, but I  don't go there regularly."}
{"text":"I am a resident.   The food has gotten better since they opened as well as the wine list.  The service is still spotty at best.   Sometimes it is fine and other times it's like the staff doesn't care.   Older wait staff is usually better.  Younger staff is mixed but primarily bad service.  

Finished my meal 30 minutes ago.  Finally stopped by to ask if we were finished.  

Yes they have the views but the experience isn't consistent and I they definitely need to improve the experience.   

The restaurant isn't that large and this shouldn't be that hard."}
{"text":"If you don't eat here, you might like it. The view is amazing and the drinks are not bad. Service was good but the food was awful. We came here for an Easter brunch and I think it was the worst brunch I've ever had...which was sad because I love brunch!! My dad got the chicken and waffles and the chicken wasn't all the way cooked. He sent it back and got a salad- no manager came out to apologize for the raw chicken: My mom got the salad with seasonal vegetables but the only vegetable on the lettuce was shredded carrots and they forgot the dressing. I got the east coast panini which came out with soggy bread that had not been grilled and cold overly salty salmon. I like salt and this was just too much. We ordered monkey bread to try to salvage the brunch and it was just chunks of bread covered in Hershey's syrup and whipped cream...not what I would consider monkey bread. Will not come back for the food but would possibly come if I was in the area and wanted to have a drink with a view."}
{"text":"The margaritas are disgusting....they taste like sweet and sour, but the meatballs are amazing! The manager (Jared or Jerry) is super nice and attentive! Our friend was getting proposed to here so he got us all champagne for her. I would come back to try other things on the menu! Plus, the view is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"1/8/17..... I could write a review that would be the length of an essay because it takes so long to get your food... this place has amazing views but horrible service and time."}
{"text":"A beautiful view and surroundings do not make up for the poor service and mediocre food.  It started off badly when the hostess simply pointed to where our table was and said \"over there\".  We had to ask several times for drink refills and for the wine we ordered.  Our server attempted to get our order before we had even seen a menu.  My pretzel crusted chicken was over cooked and looked unappetizing to begin with.   This is basically a golf clubhouse but they are sadly missing a wonderful dining experience with the poor service and food."}
{"text":"My wife and I almost didn't go due to some of the lack luster reviews but I have to say we were incredibly pleased with our visit.  The decor and views are great and right now the drive up is lovly with all the wild flowers in bloom along the road.   Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly staff and seated near the open kitchen.

Both my wife I had a drink from their well equipped bar which is located in the center of the restaurant.  From the start our waitress and other staff were very attentive and answered all our questions and checked on us regularly but not to the point of being annoying.  

We started with the poutine which very unique and the best I've had outside of Toronto and Montreal. I highly recommend it. Funny that the only two places I've had it outside of Canada happen to both be in Verrado.  For our entrees my wife enjoyed the BLT with the candied bacon and a bowl of their prime rib soup. This soup was out of this world with a nice topping of a horseradish sour cream dollop on top. Can I say again this soup was amazing.  I had a bowl of the mushroom soup and while very good it wasn't what the prime rib soup was. I also had the butter braised chicken and it was some of the most perfectly cooked chicken I've ever had.  It was served over a fantastic creamed spinach with tomato fondue and yam's that I could have sworn were gnocchi.  

As we usually dine with our kids and I inquired as to a kids menu and they did share a copy which was both agreeably priced and well rounded. 

This is for sure on our future go to spots! Well done and I look forward dining here again."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a good friend out on the patio this afternoon.  Had the Wild Mushroom Bisque, the Chop Chop salad, and some Coffee Chocolate Chip Gelato for dessert.  Excellent food and presentation.  Waitstaff were very pleasant, polite, and professional.  

All in all, a very nice experience.  Next time, we're bringing the husbands back there for dinner and to see all of Phoenix lit up at night in the distance."}
{"text":"for starters, this place and views are outstanding!! I love coming out to lunch with my girlfriends, even though we are young and picky the food is still so great. the service is very fast and servers are quick on their toes. this is my absolute favorite place in verrado :)"}
{"text":"I'm just getting started with my valley food experience! This was my second nice chill environment nicer brunch spots. Not happy with the food quality, my food came out a little later then the level of customers waiting, we had a lot of issues with the cooks and he food, our waitress was nice but when you have poor cooks it just makes the overall experience not good. Will I try this spot again? Yes but for a last chance when my parents come into town, and we will see if it was just a off day on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Wow. Best menu in the West Valley. Great view. Great value on the meals. Check it out."}
{"text":"Too expensive!!! For what you get, did not like the view of handicapped pools while eating, no signage anywhere walked around not knowing where to go very confusing and uninviting"}
{"text":"Went there Friday for lunch, Kelly was our sever. I had the Monte cristo and my wife had the Ruben and she loved it. My sandwich was like dessert, the jam they put on it was very tasty. The place had nice decor as well as a nice view. I can't wait to try they're brunch on Sunday. We also spoke with a guy who I think was the manager from Kansas really nice guy. 
We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you like Prego it's your place message to Chef less oregano please in your red sauce. Order Mahi it was dry and tasted old and fishy. Expected better.The overall service was great"}
{"text":"Attempted to do happy hour menu last evening @ The Vic. I arrived early waiting to meet up with my husband and fellow golfers. They were running late but did make it just before 6pm which is Happy Hour cut off. When we inquired with the waitress she advised us that we could still order off of the Happy Hour menu. A few minutes went by and when she returned to our table she now told us there was no way to manipulate the computer therefore no Happy Hour prices. We now had to order off the regular menu. Our waitress was great, however I feel she had no back up from management.
I ordered the Bourguignon Flatbread which sounded great, until I received it and found the cook had more than burned it and then tried to cover up the char with the sauce, etc. Wish I'd taken a photo as it was black. Even had it not been totally charred, it was just a piece of flatbread on a blank plate for $14. My husband had the meatballs with polenta fries - nothing to rave about. In the end, the Manager stopped by the table and asked if I wanted something to replace the flatbread however it had already ruined my taste buds. She agreed to remove the flatbread from the bill.
I agree with a previous reviewer that the only way this place will make it is quit trying to be \"upscale\" in Buckeye. Change up the menu to be affordable as well as standard menu with some good beer, burger prices etc. which will attract the golfers. The golf course restaurant just down the hill at the other golf course is really good with better prices."}
{"text":"We have a monthly dinner club that tries to find new restaurants.  While the menu was slightly limited, the service, atmosphere and attention to detail was exceptional.  Our group tried numerous different items and not one disappointed. Very fresh and tasty. The waiter knew the menu and was able to identify the differences in flavor so each person came away satisfied.  The beer was excellent and the wine selection was large enough to give everyone something to enjoy. Very casual and relaxed.  If I had to find a negative, I'd say the menu is limited, the bathrooms are a hike and they need sun screens.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would go back."}
{"text":"A friend stated he'd heard good things about \"The Vic\", so we decided to try it for a Sunday brunch on June 11th.

The ambience is nice and everything was clean and orderly.  But that is where the good part of this review ends.  We sat unattended for almost 10 minutes before being asked what we wanted to drink.  Realizing service seemed to be slow, we ordered our drinks and also ordered our meal, thinking we'd get a head start.  No such luck.  Took close to 15 minutes to get a burger and fish/chips.

It's not like the place was busy....it appeared there were more staff than patrons but most staff were standing around or wandering, looking for something to do.  The place has a path to become great, but not with current management and staff enthusiasm.  On scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 3."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, and an awesome view.  We stopped by on a motorcycle ride and had a very nice lunch.  It's not close to anything (unless you live in Verado) but worth a drive."}
{"text":"Not a winner for Verrado, we have eaten here two times and not only was the food terrible but the service too.  First time we ordered two sandwich meals, asked for a salad as a side dish, after waiting to long the meal came with fries.  The waitress was flustered (by the way there were probably 20 people in the whole place) and several waitresses.   Second time we thought give them some time to practice we took friends and again could not find a hostess to be seated, then when we did we ordered three meals of the hamburger, well done and got burnt burgers with our six fries.  We had to keep asking for refills of ice tea, and ask for ice.  Waitress kept disappearing.  Both meals totaled $34.00!  What a waste, well done does not mean burn the meat.  

First time shame on them, second time shame on us.   Better burger at the Wigwam, and prices."}
{"text":"Awesome new items on menu. Pimento crusted tenderloin was amazing. 
Get to know Steve the manager makes some awesome looking one of a kind cocktails

Best view in West Valley"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Sunday and the staff was wonderful and the food was great but the audience was fantastic
We are definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"The food was great. My husband and I both had the guacamole as the appetizer. For the main dish I had the fish and chips and my husband had the Mack and cheese. The main dish portions were good size. For dessert we had a lemon cheesecake which was delicious! My husband had a beer on tap and I had the white sangria. The atmosphere is wonderful and opens up to an amazing view. Our server was on point and knowledgeable about their food and was very friendly. We will definitely come back. It's very nice to have a place like this on the west side of town."}
{"text":"So the view overlooking the city lights of Buckeye and Phoenix was really nice. The food though needs a little bit of help. The food was mediocre at best.. 

I ordered the Lobsta Roll and was not very impressed. The bread roll they used was hard. The lobsta mix was lacking and it also needed a little more flavoring. I ate more bread than the lobsta mix. 

I tried my friends salmon and it was ok. It was slightly over cooked and again lacked flavor. 

Unfortunately, I was not very happy with food, but the view was great."}
{"text":"The service was horrid and the food equally as bad!  Had a Patata flatbread.  I mean how can you mess up a flatbread?  The potatoes were crunchy and had almost no Brussels sprouts.  Dish was served at room temperature. Total bill $23 dollars + tip for flatbread withBacardi and coke. Eek!! They aspire to be something they definitely are not.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Vic on a Friday night for date night. The view is amazing. As is the patio and restaurant with its roll up windows. 

We had no wait. We ordered the hummus appetizer, a Thai Shrimp Flatbread, and the Rueben sandwich. 

The hummus was fabulous. The plate looks beautiful, it included big, large red olives (I had never tried thus type before), really lovely roasted vegetables with pesto and basil oil, homemade pita, and a reddish hummus. I wanted to put my face in the whole plate. It was really well done. 

The Thai flatbread was mediocre. It looked good, had a homemade dough that was cooked well, but the shrimp wasn't curried as promised, it had watery vegetables on it, and had a weird mayonnaise based sauce that was unpalatable.

The Ruben sandwich came with hand cut fries that were to die for. The sandwich was good, tons of meat, but without the sauerkraut (my hubby doesn't like it, weird man) they cooked it a bit long and it was a bit dry. 

I ended up not liking the Thai flatbread and let them know about it. The manager explained that even she didn't like it. They took it off the bill and asked if I wanted anything else. I asked for another hummus. They charged us for it. I found that weird. Usually when they have to replace your meal you don't get charged for the replacement. (It's not like I ordered the $29 salmon dish.) I was a bit disappointed in that, I felt like that was poor customer service. 

The three stars was for the way they handled the dish that I didn't like and for the hit and miss menu. It seems they have great or mediocre dishes and I found about half of it uninspired. (Potato soup on a Friday when it's 117 degrees?!) 

We might go again because of the view and the hummus. But I might wait for the fall menu."}
{"text":"6 stars for service..... the bartender (bar manager) took care of us for drinks and dinner.   He was spot on for service.  Friendly, attentive and outgoing, I felt like we knew him for years.  Other service staff pitched in and helped when needed - a real great team effort.  The food was 4.0 stars.  Everything was solid for sure, battered cod with chips was fresh, delicious (cod was a little dry) but otherwise great.  We shared a southwestern Caesar salad that was tasty spin-off of a old standby.  We also had some great roasted shrimp that were simmered in butter and herbs in the wood oven.... all good.  Drinks were served correctly and tasted good.  The place was packed - I'd return next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Stopped by after work with coworkers and was disappointed at the confusing access (made us walk around, not through, the building to get to the bar area???)  Servers did not seem comfortable with the size of our group, although we had called ahead and reserved a large table. They did take care of our drink orders, and everyone was happy until we saw the menus:  Duck eggs?  Poutine? Honey mussels?  This restaurant is in Buckeye. 
First time I have ever seen a group of guys after work, having drinks, and not a single person ordered anything to eat. No appetizers, nothing. Would highly recommend \"deconstructing\" the menu rather than the oysters..."}
{"text":"The Vic Bar + Kitchen has done an amazing job with service, presentation, view, ambience and awesome food. 

We stoped by here after visiting a local furniture store, not knowing what to expect. It will now be a regular hang out.  

Attention to detail and fresh ingredients were evident from the master chef. The bartender was a wizard and the server, \"Jimmy\", was like a old friend that we hadn't  seen for years, although we just met him.  His friendly demeanor and menu knowledge tied together the excellent food, wonderful views and great drinks. 

Here is a friendly tip: we added the $5 roasted corn appetizer to our other appetizer and main meals. The roasted corn is the lowest price item on the menu but stole the show!  It changed the way I think about corn for life.  It was fantastic!!

We really love this place.  A true gem."}
{"text":"We have tried to give this place a chance being we live in the community, however the food is subpar and service is so-so. We so want to love this place as it could easily be our go to, but we haven't been able to bring ourselves to take any of our regular out of town guests until something improves. Food is bland, small portions, and prices much higher than it deserves. Keep in mind we regularly eat at upscale and trendy restaurants, and were so excited for the farm to table feel of this place. Hopefully things get better. Until then you will find us at our other local faves being the Verrado Grill and Tempo Urban Bistro."}
{"text":"This is one our go-to places in Verrado for Happy Hour. Everything on the menu is unique and delicious, and WHAT a view!"}
{"text":"Do not get the pork. It was expensive and didn't have much Pork, just fat.   I asked the waitress if the dish was like tenderloins and she said yes.  That's the only reason I ordered it. 

Nice restaurant and beautiful view. 

Wanted desert and the only thing available was chocolate cake. How do you run out of desserts?

I would stick to something simple if there is a next time. 

Very disappointed.  Might only return for a drink and view."}
{"text":"Service *(Took long for our waiter to take our order )
Food**(very bland no flavor)
Atmosphere*****(Stunning Views!)
Drinks****(My sister ordered the hunsman drink and got a little something extra in her cup.... Let's just say it had four legs and wings. Bartender apologized and served her a new one)

Dear Mr Vic, 
  I want to love your place I really do! But I have to say I've been disappointed twice. I would like to see better service, better food selections and more flavor added. Your place has a lot of potential with a few tweaks you could have something really special.

{"text":"Short Story-

                     ***************Breathtaking View*****************
                     Farm to Table Great ingredients but Technically mostly Flawed.

Long Story- 

                   The menu on-line looks amazing but when you take the hike to drive here the menu is very abbreviated with few choices. We started off with two appetizers. One was a deviled local duck egg. The egg came from a very small duck because it looked hen sized. The filling was runny and lumpy and not flavored so great. The egg sat on top of chopped up egg whites that were very similar to rubber. Not a good start my stomach was turning after ingesting a very rubbery egg white.

The Seared Shishito Peppers were good but the Blueberry Sugar didn't make an obvious appearance in this dish. I don't know if I got any Blueberry Sugar.

I had the Melon Salad that was Almost Very Good but it was missing the radish flowers promised. My salad also contained Guanciale that was cold and greasy straight out of the refrigerator. This was suppose to be a meal and if you take the time to look at the picture you will see that this was not enough to be a meal. I feel that this plate should be on the appetizer menu. My server tried to be a comedian and said to me, \"WOW you ate all that!\" I felt like smacking him.

My husband had the Smokie. Everything on his plate was house made. He said the meat was packed very tight and was ground very fine. I think what he least liked about the sandwich was that you can't pick it up to eat because the roll was too tiny for the sandwich and you have to eat it with a knife and fork. 

I was still hungry and was hoping dessert would be the saving grace but instead it was the nail in the coffin. Our server said one of two of the most favored desserts was the Strawberry - Lemon Icebox Cake. On my first bite I got something IN MY MOUTH THAT RESEMBLED A LUMP OF SILICON GLUE. I pulled it out and showed the waiter. He ran it back to the kitchen and they said it was gelatin. I don't know what it was but it seemed just like a lump of silicon glue. Here goes my stomach turning again. Even if the cake didn't contain that foreign object I thought it was not a restaurant quality dessert. It was like something from a box mix. It was like something a neighbor or an aunt would whip up and not something I was looking forward too.

Small Duck Egg with runny lumpy filling over rubbery egg whites
Missing ingredients - radish flowers and possibly missing Blueberry Sugar
Salad should be salad sized or be listed as an appetizer 
Cold Greasy out of the refrigerator meat
Smokie was not well thought out and should be functional as a sandwich
Silicon-like object imbedded in dessert

Yup I've had better......

If you eat with your eyes all is ok

Good Luck"}
{"text":"There is only word I could use to describe this place: Swanky. 
There is something about The Vic that just feels grand, Maybe its the crazy high ceilings, maybe it's the awesome woodwork, heck, maybe it's the wall of wine. but it just feels super upscale, yet approachable. 

We first were greeted and immediately welcomed by a bubbly warm hostess who seemed to really enjoy her job. Our wait staff was attentive and pleasant, and their uniforms have a sweet vintage look to them.

the food was great, my better half enjoyed the \"Smokey\" which is a house made sausage on a great bun. I had the BLT with heirloom tomato and the mushroom bisque, which was to die for. We were wonderfully surprised and will be back to try out dinner as soon as we can."}
{"text":"First time here for our anniversary.  I was a bit skeptical based on some of the reviews I read.  Our experience was nothing less than perfect. My wife ordered the Monte Cristo, HUGE!! And very tasty, it equaled 2 meals for her.  I ordered the Pappardelle with Bolognase and it was excellent. My wife ordered a pomegranate martini that was delivered as a cranberry martini (oops) and our waitress, Aly,  who was awesome btw, made it right at no charge. Maybe some have been here on an off day, but we were very pleased.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night, service was very slow. I like the new menu.  Impressive. 
Service, however, really needs some improvement Just the overall lack of attention to detail is disappointing. This place has all the makings of a spectacular restaurant and has the best views in the city, but it won't get there until they hire better wait staff. They really need to stop hiring teens, if they want to take this place to the next level."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast three times and all three times have been disappointing. First time I ordered an ice tea and it took about 20 min-30min to get it. Another time they where about to make my coffee with regular milk rather than soy which I ordered (I'm very specific about this and tend to repeat myself a few times because I can't have milk). This morning, we got there early so we waited for them to open. Their website says 7:30 so we waited and at 7:30 went to the door and it was locked. We waited about 15 min for them to open their doors and nothing so we left. I'm sure it's not always like this but it leaves a bad flavor. We ended up going to Tempo instead.
Update:
Returned this afternoon and manager apologized regarding the opening time this morning. Food was good and service was great. Will return to try dinner soon"}
{"text":"The Steve Cocktail was my favorite item on the menu I'll admit. It boasts turtle pecan and Bourbon which blend so well together. There was even turtle pecan in the single large ice cube in my drink! Way to stick with the theme!

I also enjoyed the Chipotle flatbread pizza, which was really good. It was thin and very personal sized, but was cut into 6 slices, perfect for sharing. I expected this though ordering from the appetizer section since I wasn't too hungry but wanted something to hold me until dinner and it did just the trick.

My friends had the pretzel bread Reuben sandwich, which I did mildly envy, but that's okay because I'll most likely order that next time. 

The setting outdoors is beautiful. The Vic is nestled on a hill with scenic views of the surrounding mountains nearby and the rolling hills of the golf course and community of Victory below. This is a drive to get here but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice view, good food. Lots and lots of bugs and moths flying around while we were eating outside on the patio. That was kind of annoying. The food was good, but I thought a bit overpriced. We would go back. It made for a nice date night."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews that Vic's had some challenges we decided to try it anyway.  The atmosphere is nice with great views.  We sat outside.  My husband likes a light beer and waitress had to asked someone what was the lightest they served.  He got his beer and I got a bloody mary.  When we went to order, I asked for the flat bread.  She said they were out of flat bread and also the monkey bread.  These are 2 items on their brunch menu.  We decided not to order any food.  On our way out, we heard someone ordering a Coors light.  My husband would of ordered it if he had known but was told this other beer he got was the lightest.  I guess we were prepared not to have a good experience.  We decided we will not return.  Too bad they couldn't work out the bugs that a new restaurant can have."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, outside seating on the patio with plenty of scenery to take in. Very comfortable seating, music is turned down so you can absolutely enjoy a conversation. Our hostess was so personable and let US choose where we preferred to be seated. We ordered Bloody Marys which were outstanding and just took in the peaceful surroundings. Going to be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"Very unique menu, and Joe the chef is the most awesome, sexiest dude you'll ever meet"}
{"text":"I have never been to a place that makes their own ketchup!  The Vic prides itself on fresh and organic. The restaurant appears to have been carved from the rocks that surround it. The scenic views of mountains and the city lights are majestic. On this visit, I tried the Vic burger, which was cooked to perfection. I also tried the squash pasta which was delightful; the hint of mint and basil paired perfectly."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for a date spot or special occasion. The food is always top notch and you can't beat the view! We also love bringing family and friends here when they come visit Arizona because of the awesome food and view!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want warm food or good service. Came here for breakfast took 15 minutes for drinks. Waffles came out cold. Let our server know, we were sitting next to the kitchen so could see the food go back. My remade waffles sat there while server after server walked by and never brought them. After 10 minutes I got up and got them myself."}
{"text":"We went one afternoon, and it was Fabulous 
Great view, Great Bartender, Talkative Host, Great Food
We went back early evening few days later, and had different experience.
Waitress seemed to need experience w details.  Always serve a new beer w clean glass, Always put slice of fruit in cocktails.
Evening bartender, and all staff needs to smile more.
Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great food and drink in a stunning location with views all around. My only suggestion would be to please add more vegan friendly options!"}
{"text":"Lauren was absolutely amazing. Nothing better than a knowledgeable and happy server! We had the greek pita wrap with roasted vegetables instead of chicken. The hummus plate and the guacamole and chips were fabulous. Would love to see a vegetable patty so I can have a delicious burger. 

Visit 6/2 update! Win for Vegan Options!
The Beyond meat burger was phenomenal!
This vegan patty was plated with hummus and fresh vegetables. This was a specialty dish but the burger will have the same wonderful Patty! This was the best thing I have tried at The Vic Kitchen.
What a wonderful spot in the west valley to catch an vegan bite and see a beautiful view!"}
{"text":"Provided us with awesome wedding reception in their private room. Great service, great food. Couldn't ask for more. Went to the bar the night before and it was awesome as well. The environment is great for a nice date night without the large crowds and loud music. Definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"Update 5/2017:  No longer give it 5 stars.
I was going 1-3 times a week for lunch.  The kitchen has a new chef. They removed all my favorites for drinks and food  Atmosphere is still nice, views are still good, most of the staff are really good.   Tried the new menu twice. Just can't get into it.  Everything was hot and spicy.  I couldn't find much on the menu that wasn't spicy.   The community/area caters to 55+.  I think so much spicy isn't such a smart menu.

Feel free to read my prior review, but it's not the same for me. 

Sorry Vic. Missing the old menu.  Moving on to other venues.

Gave 3 stars because the atmosphere, staff and views are still good.  Not sure if I'd still say 3 stars.
________________________________________
 I love the atmosphere. Refined feel, but reasonably priced. Food is exceptional quality and offers a very unique menu. Everything is made fresh. The chef even has a special garden for his veggies. Only been in for lunch so far and only ate light, but food was great quality and filling.  Great choices in beer selection, though not as many dark beers as we like. And their specialty drinks are great.

The staff...  all I can say is the staff are as exceptional as the food.  Jerry and Ricky were great servers.  Jerry remembered us from the week prior including recalling drinks we were interested in.  Made our visit a real treat.  

Views... of the Valley on two sides with open patio seating overlooking the golf course and view below.  To the sides are granite mountains including Tiger Mountain.  Behind the exclusive facade of the clubhouse is a fabulous pool area, tennis courts, pickleball and an Art Center - sorry, for residents only beyond the restaurant.  Offers a pretty view when dining indoors to the public though.  I understand they have live music occasionally and it has a great venue for that as well.

On a quick note. The hours are a bit weird, but they have them posted online.  Wish they were open for dinner in the early part of the week too.  Still, was worth the wait."}
{"text":"For the time being, this is a lovely place to sit outside (awesome view), have a drink and possibly a few apps. But even then, expect slow service.  Would not recommend dining here. Without going into our groups (4 people) entree choices, suffice it to say, that although each one of us chose a different entree, no one was happy with their meal.  Overcooked, incorrect dinner (can't the server see the entree was incorrect BEFORE they bring it out and place it in front of you?!?1?) along with un-informed servers, every one seemed new and inexperienced  and a bartender that can't make a vodka gimlet :(  The patio is awesome though, hoping they work out all the kinks, it truly is a nice venue."}
{"text":"I would agree with the comments that Matt  the manager is great.    He took the service to another level by being personal with our table, especially with the special requests we made.   We asked to taste the sauce on the grits and they were like no problem.    Steve made my drink just right and double checked.   
The service was good and prompt.   The food was great - I did switch up my meal from what was stated on the menu and there were no issues.   
We will back for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch menu, delicious salads, inventive chef, craft cocktails...this place has so much to brag about!  Make a reservation for six or more is my tip!  The Vic just won an award for Best Restaurant so be patient with the hard-working staff!"}
{"text":"The new menu is wonderful! I have visited many times and recommend all the salads, and Greek chicken pita for lunch. The setting is awesome and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"If all you are looking for is great ambiance and views, the Vic is a great place for you.  The food is just a little eclectic for my taste.  I am not sure how many people are really willing to overpay for the menu items but I would guess they will change the menu once the newness wears off.  The waitress was responsive and knowledgable, which was a plus.  I got the skirt steak over a bed of hummus, a bowl of the mushroom bisque, and an order of the fried bacon.  For my money give me a bone in ribeye and save the eclectic menu for someone else."}
{"text":"The best bar in Buckeye to date.  The service at the bar was as good as the views.  Chelsea the best model / Bartender will mix you a great drink. Special deals going on craft beer and craft cocktails and my favorite a big list of wine by the glass"}
{"text":"My husband & I went to \" The Vic\"  for an early dinner on a Fri night.  We had the large patio to ourselves and could freely admire the magnificent view which unfortunately is not quite as grand from the interior.  The flies were a tad bothersome and we were startled when a beautiful black desert wasp with red wings landed on our table. Have no fear! The tarantula hawk won't sting if you leave it alone.  Arizona nature at its best!
I regretted not having brought a dictionary to be able to decipher some of the exotic menu descriptions. Mind you, we have travelled internationally but this was the first time I had difficulties reading a menu. Therefore, I was not sure if my dish contained some of the listed ingredients! Is this necessary in Buckeye, AZ?
My  Poutine was outstanding: a very tasty cheese sauce on home cut fries. It brought back memories of home though French Canadians serve it with cheese curd and  chicken gravy.  The beet salad was fresh and delicious.  My spouse thought he had better burgers somewhere else.  
Overall, we enjoyed the experience and will likely go back but eat inside next time.
We have returned and our dinners were still good though the poutine has changed and does not contain much cheese and the snails were nowhere to be seen"}
{"text":"One of the nicer places to eat in Verrado and it has a amazing view at night. The food is good but not great but the Sonoran Poutine is amazing overall we  have gone back many times and the staff is great"}
{"text":"Love the views! Food is good. Staff is friendly. Very laid back atmosphere. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE WORSE SERVICE FROM MELONY!!!
The chef prepared our dinners beautifully but MELONY was so slow our entres were cold, cold halibut and cold salmon is not very tasty.
We ordered a second round of drinks and over a half hour later we still had not gotten them, via MELONY. 
It was an unbelievable bad experience for all 4 of us.
How difficult is it to bring two glasses of wine while your customers are eating their meal.
MELONY WAS clueless, she forgot to bring our bread, i had to ask her to bring our appetizers, the meals at 30 bucks each were served cold, what a joke!
We will not be back, beware of eating here!
We brought 2 of friends and they too had the experience as us."}
{"text":"The Vic is an interesting restaurant to say the least. It's located in the middle of the Verrado community in Buckeye. If you're not familiar with the area, you'd almost think that it was located within a resort. It's location also houses a spa and club area. Initial reviews were very positive, but the original executive chef, Robert Douglas, moved on quite some time ago from what I understand. I'm not sure if that's a good thing either.

This is a restaurant that I probably would never have discovered if it weren't for the people that we were meeting for dinner suggesting it. The location offers some gorgeous desert views where you can see everything from distant-Downtown Phoenix to Four Peaks. 

But we all know that all of this is irrelevant if your food isn't good. And after sampling multiple items, I'd say that The Vic is just okay for what it is.

The menu, which changes seasonally, tries to emphasize their made-from-scratch and farm-to-table beliefs. If this is true, they should probably do a better job of showcasing these preparation and sourcing methods.

Starters such as meatball sliders, street corn, and goat cheese were all fine and similar to what you'd fine at most places that do pub grub foods just a notch above most standards. Their \"standard\" burger was decent quality as well, but again - mostly comparable to what you'd find elsewhere. The couple we were with had mixed feelings about their food, which I can't speak for since I didn't try it.

For dessert, we opted for a five-layer chocolate cake they were offering, which was also good, but once again, something that I'll probably have forgotten about a couple of weeks from now.

Overall prices I felt were pretty reasonable for the food we received, even if other people disagree.

Anyway, The Vic is really a difficult place to review. It feels like a local hot spot for people that live in the Verrado Community, which is actually an interesting little place that appears to have made an effort to set itself apart from every other overly-manufactured and fake-feeling \"community\" in Phoenix. 

They have the right idea - but I'm not entirely sure if it'll achieve any acclaim outside of the demographic that it's catering towards. Which is fine, I guess.

Recommended to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent and the service does the best they can. I've been here on three occasions and the first time they had one waitress on a Sunday morning! That's insane. She tried her best but was extremely overwhelmed, as was the kitchen for , I'm assuming being understaffed or prepared. The two following occasions the service was better but the food took forever. It seems there is a lack of staff on the breakfast shifts or underprepared? Not sure , but love the food and atmosphere so hoping it gets better"}
{"text":"My family and I - table for 7, please - had a most marvelous dining experience last night.  Our \"foodies\" from Chicago, St Louis and San Francisco were wildly impressed. 
In the heat of the summer, outside dining at The Vic comes with a cool breeze. Service and presentation were both flawless.  Among the foodies' favorites were the cobia, lemon chicken, beets and grilled bacon with dates. (Yum). But the evening would not be complete without the \"melt in your mouth\" strawberry and lemon ice box pie.   Coming back soon!!!
Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Looks like they still are a little slow on service, but an Oracle is a squeaking wheel. That fixed it.

I tried two drinks, the Blackberry Mule and the Manager's recommendation of their Red Sangria. The Mule was very good in the traditional copper cup. I tried their Sangria after the Manager told me how they make it, since I make the best Sangria in California. It was very good, tall, cold and refreshing.

DH had the Chop Chop Salad. Since we grow our own avacados, we would have sent it back if they were \"bruised.\" But the salad was done well, and is just the right size for lunch. 

I had the Wild Mushroom Cappucino soup with Chive Oil. It is a really mellow mushroom soup, and very satisfying. I also had the Vic White Pizza, which included house ricotta, aged gouda, crucolo, bechamel, crispy pancetta and a splash of apple pom pom som on a very thin, crisp crust. This is really a great small plate, either for lunch or to share as an appetizer. 

The View we had was the interesting pool area behind the bar, and it was too hot today to sit outside. But in cooler weather, what a great location. I suspect the reason there were no kids' items on the menus is that Victory at Verrado is a 55+ part of the community, but even us wee old folks have grandchildren at times. Even so, the kids will like the pizzas and other small plates.

The food was really good, as were the drinks, but I agree that service needs to focus on the customers. As for chatting among employees, I say, \"Make it clean or make it louder.\" lol

I think you will enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The view is the only thing going for them. Service is terrible. It took forever to get our drinks and we had to send them back because the ice was melted. The waitress had to step away and ask for clarification on the menu a few times. Inexperienced staff. If you need to use the washroom you have to leave the restaurant and go into another building. Very strange layout."}
{"text":"Once you realize this little gem is in the SW Valley you'll be hard pressed to find somewhere better for a few reasons. First being the view, which is on a hilltop high above Verrado at the very North end of Verrado Way. The Vic as well as the Spa is open to the public which sit in their members clubhouse and is beautiful inside. The patio is huge and comfortable with an area to play corn hole but in need of more seating since it's going to get very busy. There's a rental building for parties as well. 

The food is very good with an excellent Chef who takes time to change his menu seasonally. It fresh, delicious and inspired. Been back 2 times last week and brought a party of 6. 

Great food, great view, great service and ambience!!!! Home run for the SW Valley!! 





We found it last week and have been"}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing. It was their first day on the new  brunch menu. I ordered the blt flatbread. It was on the salty side. My friend ordered the chilaquiles. We thought it would be on a tortilla. But it was on chips. The meal got better as the chips soaked in the sauce. The eggs were ordered over easy but were more over medium. All in all it was a good brunch. This place is very pretty and the bar tops and chairs are interesting. We will be back to try the night life."}
{"text":"Super awesome hidden gem. Very clean and the views are spectacular. They have some serious bacon going on here. Thick cut, drizzled with syrup and sugar, then baked in the oven then delivered on point!!

Going back for the bacon."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a few months before review to give them time to get established. Well don't bother going unless you live in Victory. They have locked all the air conditioned entrances to the restaurant, you even have to walk outside to get to the restroom. Speaking of the men's restroom it is sized for a house not a resteraunt. Arrived at noon Sunday for lunch, 6 people here, staff has been attentive. BLT is good, shaved carrots on a burger? They are trying too hard to be upscale in an area that isn't. For their sakes hope the Victory community supports them, otherwise it will not survive. Sad part is that is the best view of the valley on the west side. 

12/4/16 4 months goes by and we try again, after sitting for 10 minutes and not seeing a waiter/waitress we left......you can't make this up, 12:30 on a Sunday not very busy.

11/10/17 Well a year later things are looking up, attentive wait staff and food food. Glad we came back."}
{"text":"The perfect date night, special occasion, spur-of-the-moment, friend gathering destination in all the West Valley!  From the first steps in, we were graciously greeted and escorted to the hostess station.  Without exception, everyone we encountered was friendly and eager to please.  The place is beautiful and modern, and the seating options are amazing.  (Be sure to arrive early if you want to dine outdoors.) Reservations are accepted for parties of 6 or more.  You can even reserve the \"conversation pits\" at the two ends of the bar --- what's fun!!  
Our party of six enjoyed appetizers through dessert. All were exceptional in taste and presentation.  (Did I mention that the servers were so helpful, friendly and sincere?)
After dining outside on the pool/mountain view side of the restaurant, we moved indoors for an after dinner drink.  There is also the option of dining on the valley view side.  The bartender was the best and only enhanced our evening.  So personable. 
No, there is not a kids' menu, as someone complained, but that's because this is not McDonald's.  Being family-friendly, The Vic Bar + Kitchen will always try to prepare any special request.  Gotta love that!!
Be a good customer and I bet you get good service and more.  We are good customers.  Love The Vic!!!!"}
{"text":"Six stars for the view and service, love sitting up at the rounded bar with friends and taking in the view. The menu is eclectic but so far I have enjoyed everything on the menu. During happy hour they do a bacon pop corn, so yummy! Smoked wings are delicious too...lots of shareable items so a lot of fun with a group."}
{"text":"I can't stop coming here...  We've come to know some of the staff by first name and they us.  I think I've tried almost everything on the menu and Jerry the bartender makes the best Old Fashioned in the west valley.  I work in L.A. but live in Surprise and stopping here for dinner on my Friday's home makes my commute that much better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times.  The food is awesome and the views are superb.  
It is truly the nicest place around the staff, Location, menu and atmosphere are all a 10++."}
{"text":"We went to Vic on Sat for lunch.  Restaurant looks great, it's has European flair, amazing views, absolutely awesome outside sitting area with great chairs and huge pillows and Tuuci umbrellas. 

When food came there was no silverware nor small plates on our table. We had to wait, while food was getting cold for silverware to come. When we ask for plates girl who served our food  brought us ONE plate,  we had to ask again for a plate.   After about 10 min into our dining experience waiter came and brought us two small plates for our flatbread(!!)

Food was one of the worst we had for a long time.
We ordered Poutine and Vic white flatbread .
French fries were low warm, mushy and were swimming in a grease.  Flat bread was burned and tasted horrible. Whatever was put on a flat bread was sour, I never found Gouda on our bread.
We will go there for Glass of wine and have a seat outside and relax.  If you don't eat there you will be fully satisfied with the views and atmosphere.

{"text":"Yes, awesome and a hidden gem.. Good food and service. I had the fish on the bed of tomatoes & lettuce and mushroom soup 5 stars hand down.

Close on Monday open at 8am for light breakfast, coffee. 

 Very clean and the views are spectacular a must to visit

Call the place if you get lost on directions you love the love the place."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday with family after touring the victory homes. My hubby and I have been here a few months back, but wanted to give it another shot. Once again, beautiful location and view! Our server was very sweet and answered our questions about the community and suggested things to check out in the area. The food took a while but we were surprised by some delicious monkey bread to munch on while we waited. My daughter's sliders came out first, which was greatly appreciated! Our greek pitas were a little on the dry side and the greek sauce was bland. We hung out for a while and sipped on our wine to enjoy the beautiful view, despite the so-so food. When my daughter got restless again, our server showed her the beanbag game which was super nice and earned her major points from us! Just like last time we came, we agreed that the experience trumps the food here. Three stars for exceptional service by Mia and the gorgeous view. One star for food. I will be back for the monkey bread, drinks, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in buckeye! Be far it has an amazing view and perfect for a date or any special occasion! We came in on a Sunday and everyone got a  free monkey bread"}
{"text":"I wanted to love The Vic Bar and Kitchen but it fell short in a number of ways.  The food was very good, better than many of the meals we've had the 3 years we've lived in Phoenix. The drinks were tasty and the view is beautiful.  

But...we had to wait nearly an hour and 20 minutes to get a table inside.  Once seated, we were next to a bay door that was open.  It was like we were still outside.  I asked if the door could be lowered and they obliged.  The waiter was okay but he forgot plates for our appetizer and one of our orders in our group of 4 came out incorrect.  

Recommendations:  Wait a few months before you visit so management can address these issues and train the staff.  I think the kinks are still being worked out.  If you decide to go on a weekend evening, call beforehand to find out the waiting time.  They don't take reservations unless you have a party over 6. There's only 8 tables inside the restaurant so be willing to sit outside in the cold if you go in the evening."}
{"text":"We rolled into town and enjoyed our first breakfast here. Lovely ambience and great food. I had the Eggs Benedict and kids had waffles. I keep hearing on the reviews that it is not kid friendly...I thought it was great. Kind wait staff, tasty food, lovely atmosphere and decent prices. I'll have to check it out again maybe on lunch or dinner and see if it's consistently good. So far two thumbs up! :)"}
{"text":"As a Vegan living in Buckeye, my restaurant choices are limited. The Vic has a meatless burger that is the best, most delectable burger that I have found in the valley, their drinks amongst the best as well. Loved the location, architecture and views as well.. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Funky alternative food that tastes delicious. From farm to table menu and great specialty drinks. We expected a view of the city but it's a view of the mountains and the community pool on one side and Verrado on the other side. Still very pretty. Plenty of outdoor seating and really nice ambience."}
{"text":"Very nice view of the Verrado community and mountains! Also good drinks at bar, with good flat bread pizza. Nice place for a date or family outings."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in the prime location in Verrado, this restaurant keeps odd hours. At the lunch hour on a normal business day they were closed at 12pm. Then on our second trip out and up the hill, the hostess was so busy tossing her long curls, she had to \"ask\" her boss if we could sit in a booth to have coffee and desert? Really? The hostess offered us the bar, but with a minor (16) I don't like to do that with my son. The hostess insisted it would be fine for us to sit at the bar. The rudeness let alone the \"have to ask her boss\" comment is enough to make you wonder what is really going on at The Vic Bar + Kitchen. It's a great location but really needs a chef who knows how to run both ends of the business."}
{"text":"Amazing views food to match
Comfortable setting 
Yummy 
Gem in Buckeye AZ 
We will be back 
Wonderful Mother's Day menu
Great service sat at the Bar

{"text":"First time here, tried The Vic for breakfast and IT IS MY LUCKY DAY because even a simple breakfast was absolutely delicious! They will make you pretty much anything you want so don't let the small menu discourage you. Over-easy eggs were perfect, cooked white (without scorch or browned edges) and runny yolk, veggies added to potatoes were cooked perfectly, thin sliced but still had texture, pancakes were easy to cut with a fork and had a nice flavor, and they were served with a dish of real maple syrup. Bacon cooked all the way through without being burned and a delicious sausage,  and I am not a fan of sausage so if I liked it, you will too!  My husband ordered a Denver omelet and it was so yummy. Again, eggs were not scorched. Everything fresh and fresh made, even the apple juice was fresh squeezed.  And the service was unbelievably attentive and friendly.  I felt like I was at an expensive  resort. Everything was beautiful and maintained.  Can't wait to go back for lunch, dinner,  and Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chill-bar in the Valley. The food is fabulous and the cooks are creative and accommodating to dietary concerns. My newest favorite is the pimento cheese appetizer but in all fairness, I haven't had a bad meal here. Whatever I eat becomes a new favorite. The beer is cold and they have a great selection, but the mixed drinks are my favorite. The bartenders are fun and friendly, and it's just got a great vibe. You cannot find a better view anywhere in the west valley. My one request is to add seasoned sweet potato fries to the menu :)"}
{"text":"Amanda was above and beyond, very attentive, super impressed with the service.
Very friendly staff, amazing atmosphere, huge variety of drinks, food is off the chain, don't  miss the hummus and pita appetizer! Def a must see spot!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The food was great. We came for brunch. Had the eggs Benedict and monte cristo. Our server, Mya, was very attentive and funny. She made all of us smile. Come back for the sriracha aioli and Mya's amazing service."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful, it has a great view.  The service was good. The menu was what I was expecting, as I did a little Yelp research ahead of time. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. However, I just wanted to put it out there that a few of the items on the menu were a dollar or two more when the check arrived.  Please update the menu to reflect the correct prices."}
{"text":"Best view in the west valley! Great for an after golf lunch or a special night out. The food was great although I worry they are trying to be a bit too \"upscale\" in an area that does necessarily appreciate the upscale nonsense (i.e. bizarre food combos described in an overly complicated way). Great atmosphere and staff was wonderful! We will come here again and looking forward to that view!"}
{"text":"What a night!  Founder's Day 2016 Cocktail Party......The staff, band, dancing, food, drink, with, of course, the most amazing view.  Great evening shared with friends/neighbors.  Coach & Kim Tomlinson"}
{"text":"Let me start with the restaurant itself hard to find but spectacular views, absolutely gorgeous, unfortunately that is the best thing I can say.  We went on a Tuesday evening about 530p so not a ton of people in there only a group of about 10 that were drinking but not eating.  It took a bit for the bartender to appear and she was not overly friendly no recommendations.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine they were good.  We ordered two appetizers the first being the bacon with bleu cheese stuffed fig.  What could go wrong with that you ask? The bacon is cooked on the grill where the outside of the bacon looks crispy the inside fat has not rendered at all. Figs, bleu cheese delicious.  The next food item we ordered was a spinach salad with the first ingredient being listed as cheddar, guess what did not come out on our salad.  Now I would understand if the kitchen was busy but as I said we were the only people eating at that time and we could see the cooks just talking and standing.  This place has some technical problems that need strong management to fix."}
{"text":"The food and especially the view was excellent! Our server was a bit new so that took some extra time. I would love to find a golf tee time to be able eat and drink after golf."}
{"text":"Chef Robby is kickin it and my absolute fave is the steak!!! The atmospheres is relaxed and the scenery is breathtaking. I suggest taking a nice trip up there in the early evening to watch Phoenix light up. Not to mention they carry 300 Foot Steve which is a kick ass beer from Saddle Mountain Brewing company."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely breakfast with my hubby this morning. Friendly people, beautiful view, healthy and great tasting food. Highly recommend the Sunday Special Flatbread - I loved it! My husband had the Old Faithful with 3 eggs and candied bacon. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Apparently you have to be a \"club member\" to walk onto their lawn and enjoy the view, even after dropping a senseless amount at this subpar restaurant. I can't believe the environment that is cultivated at this place!! And, yes, service is poor and slow at best."}
{"text":"Moved to Arizona from California this past weekend and was told by a friend to go in for brunch. 

The location is beautiful and the ambiance makes you feel like the rest of the experience will be just as worthy.

Unfortunately my experience wasn't enough to entice me back for a second visit. The food was alright but the process was completely severed any chance there could be for me to return.

I don't know if it was our server or if it was the kitchen staff, but it took multiple times for them to get our orders right. 

I don't like being the customer that returns his/her food if one small thing is off, but when you hand over a completely different platter than what you've order I will speak up. On top of that, our order was missing bacon. Upon the arrival of the bacon, my company and I could see instantly that the bacon was not fully cooked.

I felt bad for having our server come back and forth, but a place like this should upkeep a specific dining execution. 

The staff was friendly regardless of my tables demand, but the food wasn't enough to keep me interest."}
{"text":"The Vic tries hard to be a cultured restaurant. It offers bar food disguised as good eating. The view is great and the ambiance is good."}
