{"text":"Ordered Panang Curry from here on UberEats. Apparently they've never done takeout before, because they took a plastic container full of curry with a flimsy lid and just tossed it into a paper bag. The lid obviously came off and the curry exploded all over the inside of the bag, ruining everything.

I doubt the driver was nice to the bag, but they should expect this stuff to be manhandled a bit in transportation. That's why other restaurants use sturdy containers or put elastics around them (or both).

The upshot here was a bit of curry still in the bowl, so what I did taste was really good - but not a great experience for my first time ordering here."}
{"text":"Had some great curries and pad thai last night... they will even do a curry without coconut milk which tastes great as well!  Good use of spices"}
{"text":"We love this place.  It's way better than the previous Thai place that was here.  My favourite is the spicy Thai basil (street style).  The curries are also all really good."}
{"text":"Great Thai place with lots of flavor! Super cute decor and open environment! So relaxed and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"The best Chicken Panang I've ever had. The decor is simple and the restaurant is so clean."}
{"text":"I love this place.

Atmosphere is so chill. People are lovely. Food always satisfies. True hidden gem. 

You can't really order anything wrong from this menu. Always a crowd pleaser when I bring people here! It always becomes their new favourite Thai restaurant. 

Favourite is the beef khao soi (huge fan favourite), which is a delicious egg noodle in yummy golden curry. Also love the chicken green curry, silk pad thai (with real Thai tamarind), and pineapple fried rice.

Prices are also really good. Biggest plus is that it's never crowded (unlike Sukhothai down the street)."}
{"text":"First time trying this place in our neighbourhood tonight, and it was great!
The restaurant looks very empty, but I assume they do a lot of delivery and pick-up orders. We had a very nice server who was friendly and prompt. The food was great too. We had garlic beef and garlic shrimp 'From the Wok'. As well as one of the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  The best I've had in a long time.  Lots of seating for bigger parties.  Everything is made fresh to order.  The portions are large.  The appetizers are made for two people."}
{"text":"Coconut rice was delish!  Fresh spring rolls were really good and big!  Everyone loved what they ordered- love finding random places when I'm out and about.  We will be back whenever we come out this way!"}
{"text":"I've came here a few times over the last few weeks. A hybrid thai and western joint, they do lots of curries along with classic pub grub like wings and calamari. Both times its been the wing and beer special that has drawn me in. The curries are decent as well. Service is always very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I will definitely be back. Had the fresh spring rolls, and the chicken drunken noodles. Loved it. The serving was huge, reasonably priced, and the veggies were fresh. Service was prompt. My only complaint was the really loud music. We were sitting directly under the speaker and asked the waitress if she could turn it down a notch. She did but we noticed as we sat there, it started to get loud again. Not sure why a thai restaurant needs to have such loud music. Whatever."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The quality of everything is top notch. The flavours are to die for. I am obsessed with the golden curry with chicken. My boyfriend loves the calamari and spicy beef . Even the drinks are so delicious , always perfectly made. It's also got a great atmosphere. This place is my treat to myself :)"}
{"text":"Had the fresh spring rolls and they were nice, would recommend trying. We got take out and the food was ready quickly! 
Got one curry which was delicious. The wok dish (shrimp) was not extraordinary but ok. 
Haven't had a chance to sit down and eat in here yet."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was so awful and the manager was super unhelpful... Totally soured from ever going here again :("}
{"text":"Such a good Thai restaurant! Highly recommend if you're in the area! And amazing service from the whole staff! 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hosted my 39th B-Day party there, and it was a hit.  The staff and owners were easy to deal with,  and gave us some promo drink prices as it was also St Patricks Day. We kicked off the night with kareoke, some snacks,  then our DJ took over. 

Everyone had a great night and I would suggest this place to anyone who wants to host a party.  They shut down the restaurant for us.  Tommy let us move furniture to accommodate our needs, and I was thouroughly impressed by their hospitality. 

Bonus,  the staff speak Thai and Vietnamese,  so if you are looking for authenticity here's the place.  Also,  cheapest place in the city to go for drinks,  for non alcoholic try their Thai iced tea.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I think the chefs for lunch and dinner are different, have had the same dish taste different at different times of the day. It's still pretty good food though. Also great deals on pitchers $15"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the food is really good and tasty. I need my Thai fix on a regular basis, so having just moved to the area we decided to drop in for a quick lunch. The lunch specials were super reasonable, so we had Pad Thai and orange chicken. The portions were perfect for lunch and the food was outstanding. Just a word of advice, order the Silk Thai with the tamarind base as that is the proper way to make it. We enjoyed the food so much we decided to go back for dinner this week, also wanted to escape the heat and dine with AC. We ordered the pad Thai again along with basil beef. The portions were even larger for dinner so my son got a free lunch the next day. He also said it was darn good Thai food! This place needs to stay open so please go give it a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food & very friendly service! We were given an extra dish for free because they felt we were waiting too long for our meal. We didn't notice it being a long wait but appreciated the attentiveness! It often looks empty inside but don't let that put you off, it seems as though they must get a lot of takeout orders. Overall a great experience :)"}
{"text":"Wow. What an incredible gem! Everything was incredible.  We ordered the coconut soup. Phenomenal. The silk. Pad Thai and the golden curry were both phenomenal. Also the spring roles were fantastic. I can't say enough good things about his place. Decor isn't going to impress you but the food certainly will!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai restaurant I've been to.  
The sauces were flavorful and complex and the fish and shirmp were juicy and so much yumm"}
