{"text":"The food here is not very good.  The service is slow.   It is a bit over price.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a tourist trap. We were sent there by our hotel's reception staff and what a mistake that was.
The pizza was of low quality, the salads were an assembly of ingredients  out of plastic bags and cans, and my 22$ pasta had a meat souce that tasted like it came from a shelf at a discount store. Even the bread tasted, well...cheap. 
What a sorry excuse for a dinner :(
Never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian food in Montreal. The food is always fresh, the menu is extensive, and the service is on point. I only eat Italian food that comes out of the La Strada kitchen. Highly recommend. Ouai .... C'est la bonne stuff."}
{"text":"Overpriced and inedible food. Service was severely lacking."}
{"text":"Disappointment. It was cold and there were gnats like the others mentioned. There were only two tables of patrons (us being one of them) and we were ignored for a long time. 

They forgot a lot of what we asked for like bread, drinks, etc. The wait staff was extremely dressed down. They were friendly but not attentive at all. 

Food was ok. I had the swordfish. It wasn't fresh but it was edible. 

Too bad because this could be a great spot if they listened to the reviews and did a  180. The reviewers here aren't really asking a lot."}
{"text":"AWFUL! The hostess was rude. We walked in had a reservation for 4 people but needed to add one more person.  The place was empty not one customer in there and she said I don't think we can add a chair to your table. Eventually we got sat at a table with an extra chair then the server was unpleasant, she had no personality. Did not smile once. The music was so loud ( level of a dance club) we could not hear her and when we said we can't hear you she rolled her eyes. They didn't have any of the wine on the wine list they gave us. The server Pam did not know the food. We asked her if the fettuccini had chunks of tomatoes she said no... Guess what it came out with chunks of tomatoes. The food was a 2 out of 5. I will never go back here and not because of the food. That wasn't even the worst part it was the service.  I myself am a server and Pam was one of the worst servers I have ever had. She never asked if we wanted more drinks or checked on us after we received our food.  Such a disappointment for east 4th.  La strada needs to fix the service. I will not go back to this restaurant which is a shame because I love east 4th."}
{"text":"came in for a romantic date night with my boyfriend, evening began great with good drink recommendations from our server but went down hill quick from there. we ordered their lamb dish and spaghetti with meatballs. two bites into the meatballs my boyfriend discovers A HAIR IN HIS FOOD. in case that was disgusting enough when we told the wait staff about it they didn't seem surprised and seres apologetic about the issue. the OWNER came to our table and said he was embarrassed but never apologized about it instead tried blaming his distributors, he even said HE NEEDED TO CONFIRM IT WAS A HUMAN HAIR ( as opposed to an animal hair?) and not packaging material. final result? OWNER stormed out of the restaurant in rage... i felt personally threatened by him. crazy scary italian dude calls himself Mr. Tarantino... be aware. WORST SERVICE EVER. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. UNSANITARY.  NASTY

hope you have a fun visit with the health department..."}
{"text":"Went there a few times, waited forever, bad service and ok food.

There are much better spots in Lachine's waterfront to eat at."}
{"text":"This place was louder than a Motorhead concert. At a table for 6 no one could hear anyone else. The waitress couldn't hear anything. 
The food was ok but immensely overpriced-$25 for an 8 oz sirloin, really? The rib eye special was not even 1/2 of the promised weight. 
The menu was small, the food was barely adequate, the service unremarkable.
We won't return.

When we arrived at 6:45 for our 7:00 PM reservation, we were one of 2 tables seated in the whole restaurant.  We were seated next to the only other table with diners in the whole place.  It was also immediately obvious why they couldn't take a 6 or 6:30 reservation (NOT!)."}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal experience for dinner!  We were visiting Cleveland and found a great groupon deal.  The street its on is full of bars and cafes.  Food was amazing and fresh and service was very impressive"}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty, but not amazing.  The restaurant is really popular and I think once they get busy their quality starts to slip a little.  But, the menu is diverse and interesting, they have an extensive alcohol and wine list, and if the weather is nice, sitting outside is really enjoyable (and probably a little quieter than inside).

Buy a gift certificate from Restaurant.com and save yourself a few bucks."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and was pleased with the food. I had the calamari as an appetizer, the ribeye for my entree, and finished up with the creme brulee for desert. The calamari and creme brulee were both very good and the steak was good too, but not as good as I hoped it was going to be. The marinade was a little different than what I was expecting.

My girlfriend had the buffalo mozzarella, swordfish, and poached pear for her three choices, and since she is not a big eater, I was able to enjoy a lot of her restaurant week selections including a whole piece of the swordfish which was fantastic. The mozzarella was very tasty as well but the pear was terrible. Not really sure how to describe it. There was simply nothing right about it. Weird texture and an even more less than desirable taste.

I do have to mention the service, which I found to be awful. Worse than the poached pear. I never thought I would be the kind of guy who would complain on a public forum about such an issue but I found myself that annoyed and frustrated that I need to make a point of it. Our server didn't really seem to have a clue about what she was doing and after we were served she didn't come back until she brought us the check. We had to flag down another server/employee when we wanted another round of drinks. The poor service by no means ruined the evening, but as I said it was just frustrating, considering that the restaurant was not that busy and our waitress had enough time to chat with her friends a table over from us while we waited to be attended to for something as simple as another beer. Maybe she was just having an off night.

Speaking of beer they have a cool bar and a great drink menu.

Overall, good food and a cool place with nice decor. With a little better service they would have earned another star. We'll give em another shot."}
{"text":"We went here by default because everywhere else we wanted was closed on Sunday.  Huge mistake.  The server didn't seem like he knew what he was doing, yet we were the only table there.  The cocktails were horrible, and the server took forever to get our appetizer orders.  When we decided we wanted to add another appetizer, he was no where to be found.  This happened throughout the night where he was never accessible and was hiding who knows where.  I had the Farro with the wild mushroom, which was probably the best of all 6 dishes.  

The pizza was not as described as on the menu.  Being a vegetarian, I was completely appalled by the fact that they had meat on a pizza that was written as a vegetarian one.  The salad was small and way too salty.  

I'm used to and never mind paying a lot for food that is worth it.  My brother-in-law complained that his $26 fish was tasteless and completely dry.  My parents did not like their lamb at all.  

Upon finishing the meal, I was excited to hear they had creme brulee and baklava for dessert.  So we ordered one of each.  Both were terrible.   Our server asked if we cared for cappuccinos and we ordered 3.  Then he returned 5 minutes later and informed us they had shut down the espresso machine for the night.

Horrible dining experience with food and service overall.  We kept giving it another chance throughout the night but they were incapable of making up for it.  I never tip less than 20% but the more than  $30 in gratuity was a bit hard to swallow for the \"quality\" or lack of quality of service. 

We picked a horrible night to go out and ended up paying $20 of parking too.  Overall night was a bust. 

Not going back."}
{"text":"I have been to La Strada twice and both times left a bit empty.  The atmosphere is a little different and the music gets loud at night. The food itself is good but very overpriced for the quality. Pesto pasta was good, but come on 18 bucks is a bit much.  I just felt like I overpaid for something I could have made in my home. Great location and patio if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Oye, this kills me to write this because I'm such a big supporter of East 4th Street and the downtown Cleveland scene but the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem.  Simply put, La Strada needs to change...yesterday.

My dinner experience was in November with my girlfriend and another couple. 
 
First, the hostess tried to seat us at a tiny table near the front door that looked more like a waiting area than legitimate table.  We nicely asked to be seated somewhere else and they obliged, unfortunately.  Our next seat was on the second floor above the kitchen.  With no exaggeration, the temperature up there must have been close to 90 degrees and our dates thought they were going to pass out.  There was an oscillating fan that we directed towards us that slightly abated the incredible heat.

Next, our waiter seemed like a nice kid who was in way over his head.  He forgot wine, bread, and silverware and we ended up waiting for quite awhile.  Once again, he was a nice kid but was totally overwhelmed or undertrained.

The food was a train wreck.  I got the chicken parmesan that turned out to be nothing better than a lean cuisine.  The sauce had zero taste, the chicken was bland, and the linguine was just, meh.  It was odd really because it seemed like there was just no flavor to the entire dish - I didn't think this was possible.  My girlfriend got the basil pesto pasta.  Once again, it might as well have come from the freezer aisle at your supermarket - just completely devoid of depth and flavor.  The worst part about all of this was the dishes were $20 and $17 respectively.  We felt robbed for what we expected and paid.  I could have excused the subpar food if it was a 1/3rd of the price  - terrible value.

The restaurant is in a great location but just does not approach the standards set by the other places on East 4th.  Don't get tricked like we did."}
{"text":"I used a groupon deal: $20 for $40 worth of food.  Was it worth the $20? Not at all.

My company and I were only allowed to choose from a VERY limited menu with our groupon deal. For the appetizer, there was only one choice that we were allowed to order.  The appetizer isn't even listed on their menu, but it was terrible and really started off our dinner on a bad note.

FOOD: terrible.

Appetizer - Unlisted rice balls
The appetizer that we had no choice in receiving was disgusting.  Four balls of rice enveloped in a hard-shelled, doughy material were given to us.  The rice was not soft and hard to swallow.  This appetizer lacked flavor and left a bad taste in our mouths.  

Flatbread - Lamb braised with tamarind, hummus, toasted cumin, cilantro
This dish was nothing special. Portions were decent, but still not worth it. Didn't leave a memorable impression on me.

Fettuccine Fellini gorgonzola, tomato cream, pancetta
This dish tasted weird and slightly bland. It was on the dry side (I prefer my pasta to be creamy).  For the price of this dish ($18), I expected soooo much more! Furthermore, the fettuccine was under-cooked and still tough.  This could have been the result of our waiter dropping our dishes initially and therefore, our dishes might have been rushed out to us the second time around. 


SERVICE: good

Despite dropping our entrees, our waiter was very friendly, polite, and knowledgeable on menu items/specials. We were seated by the door and it was a chilly Tuesday night. One of the workers there kept opening the door and letting the cold air in while another worker wanted to keep it closed (as it should have been!).  The same worker, who seemed to be set on making our dining experience worse, proceeded to blast music throughout the restaurant using his laptop. He seemed like a really obnoxious person. 


ATMOSPHERE

- Clean
- Since we came on a Tuesday night, the restaurant was quiet and not crowded 
- Nice decor
- While the decor of the restaurant was rather tame and refined, the worker who blasted the music made the restaurant seem like it was supposed to be a club-like, lively place


Overall, I feel like this restaurant didn't give us good food because we used the groupon deal.  I wouldn't come back here.  The rather expensive menu items are not worth the price."}
{"text":"I got a groupon deal $25 for $50. Food was great and service was nice. A humus with bread appetizer and 2 seafood dishes for $50 ( but really only$25!) Great deal with the groupon!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to hang out. The ambiance is great for a group or even a private dinner for two. I love the old world style decor. I went on a saturday night and the music was very good and there was even a movie projected on the wall! We stopped by for dessert and I had the tiramasu - which was quite good but the chocolate gelato looked even better. I will have to get that next time!"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague. Bad service, bad overpriced food.  The restaurant tries to do to much diving into 6+ different genres of food. If they stuck to one, it might work. As it stands, La strada underdelivers across the board. I went once and I was disappointed.  I went a second time and kicked myself for making the same mistake twice. RUN."}
{"text":"La Strada has a very cool mood to it, with a Mediterranean look and an upstairs balcony where you can eat overlooking the first floor at sort of a diner counter or get a table.  

The food was pretty tasty, too.  Very good lamb kafta kebab.  It had terrific seasoning and was extremely tender.  The charred tomato chutney it came with was delicious.  The greek salad was also good, but nothing special.  

As for the price, I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.  This is a good date place, but you still can't beat Aladdin's for value."}
{"text":"Went here with two colleagues while on a business trip. Inside was deserted when we arrived (7 pm) but a few more tables filled up after awhile. Server was harried and a bit inattentive.  I ordered the lamb chops and they were decent, slightly fatty, but ok. Would probably go next door to Nola next time. The owner was there and stopped by to say hello and inquire about the wine we were drinking, relatively good Malbec at a pretty decent price. They were playing rock music/pop (Ice Ice Baby, etc) which seemed odd for an Italian place. Then as we were wrapping up, opera music came on WAY too loud. It was weird. Overall, decent food, somewhat decent service. Just ok."}
{"text":"Since I only live down the street from 4th, I decided to purchase the living social coupon for la strada.  I read yelp reviews before I went, and the reviews were exactly on target.  Food is alright but it is way overpriced.  The beef Kabobs were good, the calamari was yummy, I didn't care for the flat bread or my Farro.  I probably won't be back.

Service was a little slow, atmosphere was cool, food is okay."}
{"text":"After arriving with my family in Cleveland from a snowy ride from NJ, we checked into our hotel and decided on Italian for dinner.

La Stradas exceeded our expectations for food and service .

My son ordered Chicken Parmesan which he said was as good as our favorite Italian restaurant at the shore(Grazianos).  My wife ordered Chicken Marsala and couldn't say enough good things about it. I ordered the four cheese ravioli, deliciouso!

For being from out of town we received a complimentary appetizer and our server who was also the bartender was right on top  of things.  

An enjoyable dinner after a long day in the car."}
{"text":"The food is very sub par for the area in Cleveland the restaurant is in. With east 4th street being a primo dining spot I expect excellent service and food. With that being said I have given La Strada more than one chance. I first time I ate here was last summer and was not happy with a special dish they were offering. 

I bought the Groupon and was ready for round two. Sadly I returned tonight for a nice meal out. The atmosphere was welcoming and quiet, which was nice, but from the get go the service struggled.  We each had to point out our wine selection we wanted because she seemed to not know the list. The appetizer came (calamari) it was pretty standard but good. I ordered there stuffed chicken signature dish, and my date ordered the sea food pasta. The chicken was very dry and orzo was over powered by olives. The sea food pasta tasted like the noodles and sauce where made by our good friend Chef Boy R Dee. The sea food with the canned pasta was good though.  

I will not be returning for drinks or dinner anytime soon. However, management did take great care of us and our dissatisfaction; even though I requested they did not. 

Try it and maybe you will get a good kitchen that day. The menu is fun, but the food lacks the love and care that the Cleveland food scene is all about."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to La Strada on a Monday night using a Living Social purchase deal.  I debated between making this a 2 star and a 3 star review, however ended up settling on 2. 

Ambiance:
In my opinion the restaurant seems to have a bit of an identity crisis.  There was a Cuban soundtrack playing, with a general Spanish influenced decor.  That being said, the menu consisted of a lot of Moroccan and Italian items.  

Food:
My wife really loved the Chicken Kebob.   It was grilled well, and very tasty.  In addition to the Kebobs, We really enjoyed the cous cous that came with the Kebabs.  The Baby Spinach salad was tasty, however not particularly mind blowing.  The Flat Bread Pizza is pretty run of the mill.  The Calamari was better than a lot of other fried calamari that I've had .  It wasn't overcooked, or greasy, and the spicy marinara was tasty.  That being said, I don't feel like I will be lusting for their Calamari anytime soon.  The Tiramisu was tasty.

Overall for the higher price point for the meals that we ordered, the only dish that was worth the price was the Kebabs. If we are paying full price for the restaurant, we will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Very good, affordable lunch spot with nice patio. Spicy chicken sandwich and Bolognese pasta are favorites."}
{"text":"Welp, needless to say I was fairly disappointed in my experience. While the food was good, (I got the Chicken Marsala) it was not worth the 2 hour wait. 
Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning, continuously asking us if we were ready to order. When we finally did, he disappeared until he returned to ask us what we ordered again. Ummmm....

The atmosphere was great - really cute place. Intimate. Great for a date night or group dinner.  Minus the fact that they had a large projection of one of the basketball tourney games on the wall. I didn't really understand this as there were tv's at the bar and the projection was to the back of the folks at the bar. It really clashed with the overall atmosphere and seemed out of place -  If I wanted to watch the game while I ate I would have went to a sports bar. 

I'm giving it 2 stars b/c I think they have potential but I won't be returning to give it a second try until someone I know tells me they've upped their game."}
{"text":"Came at prime time super time for a birthday party which was 7 of us and of course they lost our reservation, no biggie but still not professional. They gave us a private room it was a little less loud then the rest of the restaurant which was nice. No ac or fans so dress in something breathable.

The food was ok nothing to go gaga over, I tried the shrimp 4 for about 20 it was expensive for what it is but since it's a byow they gotta up the prices. I had the veal with lemon sauce and veggies and a potato. The sauce was good on the veal, veggies and potatoes needed butter it was just blah without it. Mushroom risotto was good big portion so that was a plus.

The floors were so damn sticky and I decided to wear heels so I could barely walk and then the bathroom was so slippery the floors I was sliding all over the place. A simple one two with the mop would do the trick. Our waitress was cute and sweet nice girl she did the best she could which is always appreciated. I wouldn't go back just because there's so many better spots where I can get my yummy veal, but I had a great time with friends :)"}
{"text":"We thought the food was terrific.   I think it's one of the best meal we had at the restaurants in the E 4th Street area.  Beef Kabob was great as was the Greek Salad, Hummus and Spicey Hanger steak.  We definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a friend for dinner after they got a gift certificate because of a yelp lol. We should've just used that on drinks. The server was good but when I ordered a drink at the bar I paid my tab in cash which was around $17-18 and handed her a $20. Instead of giving me change she just took the money. I ABSOLUTELY HATE THAT. Anyways we got seated and they were already out of mussels and scallops for the night. Should've taken that as an indicator to go somewhere else since my friend wanted to try the mussels specifically. We both ordered salads and kabobs given the limited menu selection. The salad was good but $9 for a small Greek salad? My lamb kabobs were overcooked they were well well well done. The layout of the bar itself is good and a very quiet and intimate place to bring a date for a drink but would not recommend the food. Doubt I will be back here."}
{"text":"La Strada is still conducting its soft opening this week (at least I think so).  The place has potential but some kinks still need to be worked out.  The service was subpar (but friendly) for the weekday lunch crowd - they need to learn to be more efficient, which should hopefully come with time.  The other big problem is that the temperature of the food was not great (again, easily fixed).  
I will definitely wait a few more weeks and go again.  According to the owner (the same guy who owns La Dolce Vita in Little Italy), he is hoping to make La Strada a great soup/salad/sandwich place for the downtown lunch crowd - that is something definitely lacking near public square (unless you count iceberg lettuce topped with fried chicken fingers and drenched in ranch dressing a good salad).  The place has a lot of potential so I look foreward to seeing how it progresses."}
{"text":"After receiving an email from the owner and getting a $30 gift certificate, I decided to give this place another try. I made reservations for 8 o'clock dinner service and the place was pretty chill. Now that I'm inside, the place is kinda cool with its Mediterranean look but it's really dark. They have upstairs seating for a balcony view and a full bar by the front. 

I came here with the same friend from last time. The menu is limited to just 2 pages and not much of a selection. I wanted to order their mussels but they ran out of them. They must be a hot seller but kinda bummed about it. So for the alternative route, I ordered their spiced chicken kabobs and spinach salad. My friend ordered the lamb kabobs and greek salad. The greek salad was something I should've ordered; it had plenty of tomatoes and  cucumbers. My salad lacked that. It did however, had plenty of spinach. The food I had was okay. The chicken was too dry and the couscous had lack of flavor. My friend's lamb was overcooked and burnt. We were both hungry so we ate what we could. They were about 18, 19 dollars and kind of overpriced. Wasn't really worth it but I gave it a try. Not a fan and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here last night before a Cavs game due to the close proximity to the Q.  The decor is pretty cool, but the food was very average.  I had a lamb kabob and my husband had a pesto pasta dish.  For kabob's, I would pick Aladdin's any day over the one that I had at La Strada.  The pasta dish was about as good as one that I make at home.  I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"I had been here a number of times in the past, but that was a few years ago and I could swear that the restaurant served Meditteranean cuisine....is it just me?   Anyway, I met a friend for lunch and I must say that I was hesitant based on some of the reviews.  My meal was SPOT ON!   I am really not a big sandwich person, if I have a sandwich the ingredients must be fresh, piled on good bread etc.  Today, I had one of the best sandwiches that I've had in a long time.   I ordered the PLT (Pancetta, Lettuce and Tomato).  My sandwich arrived warm and delicious.  The sandwich was served on thick cut, toasted italian bread, generous portion of pancetta, topped with.....wait for it......a perfectly fried egg, yum!   There was also a nice mix of spring greens and a slice of ripe tomatoes with just a little bit of parmesan.   The server added some fresh black pepper.   The sandwich was served with a simply dressed mixed green salad.   This was a GREAT sandwich, I would definitely return for this sandwich."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! Living on East 4th street, my wife has the luxury to visit a plethora of wonderful restaurants and other establishments providing a rare combinations of great food and good atmosphere.  

While I did not have the opportunity to check out the inside, the outdoor part of the restaurant sitting on the street of E 4th was pleasant - with the exception of the most important aspect...the food.

The hostess sold us on a few dishes and talk about overselling.  She sold us on a extremely overpriced dish that was certainly not full of fresh seafood - called Nosh.  Nosh was filled a bland broth, 2 overcooked shrimps, 1 scallop and that was about it.  Definitely nothing to write home about.

If that wasn't enough, the salad that we ordered might as well have been made at a local fast food joint and was $10+.  Needless to say, the salad was nothing spectacular and the lettuce was actually a bit old.  I would be doing a disservice to the proprietor if I did not share my thoughts, but didn't get a chance as I was figuring out how the establishment was trying to rip us off from using our Groupon that we stated we had before dinner more than a couple times.  In any case, I STRONGLY advise that you check out a couple other options at your footsteps if visit the downtown area."}
{"text":"Probably the best eggplant I have ever had in my life. It is an appetizer, but I ordered two appetizers as a meal because of the lack of vegetarian options. The tomato sauce is a bit sweeter which goes great with the eggplant and two cheeses melted on it!

Nice atmosphere, has potential to be a hopping spot, but I agree with most reviews on here though... the service was sub-par. 

Also, if you order a Kabob, you get one. So just a warning to not get that dish if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"The food here is above fair, but not anything special. Our table for two had a reservation and still waited for 35 minutes before receiving any service. The best part about this restaurant is the ambiance and location. The music was a bit loud as well. C+ rating at best. Lola is next door. Go there."}
{"text":"Definitely a stylish place to hang out and even on a Wednesday night, the place was packed out.  The seating, artwork,  and loft were all interesting, but with the high ceilings, the place was a bit loud.  Food wise, it was a mixed bag.  Adding a little goat cheese to pepperoni pizza with a flavorless crust does not make it a gourmet pizza.  A much better choice is the ravioli with a tomato-cream-pancetta sauce which was a hit.  Some of the other Mediterranean dishes didn't fare as well, such as the Turkish version of a lamb kabob.  The lamb was almost burnt, and the accompanying cous cous was a but plain.  The beer list was fairly small, but had some good choices from Europe and Oregon (Rogue).  Overall, La Strada was a nice place to hangout, with some decent dishes and drinks."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. Obviously being on East 4th it gets very busy on nights and weekends. It's hard to hold that against a restaurant, but it FELT busy. You know what I mean? Some restaurants can be packed to the limit but the way you're taken care of, the time you wait for the food, the noise level and atmosphere are nice and relaxed, it's hard to tell whether it's busy or not. Here we were a bit cramped, it was very loud, it was hard to track down our server, the food took a while, it just felt like they were teetering on the brink of a disaster.

That said, the disaster never came. The food was all well-prepared and quite tasty. The server was tough to track down, but we were never in desperate need of anything when he wasn't around. It all worked out.

The primary complaints I have are that the atmosphere inside the restaurant felt less chic and hip than it did before walking in the door. It's on the coolest street in down town, but it was pretty dark, almost club-like when you got inside. Also, it was pretty expensive for what you got. Again the food was good, and my particular meal wasn't a terrible price, but one of my friends got the special appetizer and entree. Granted, you expect things to be expensive when they are specials, but his appetizer was 84 dollars, and his entree was 50. That is absolutely ridiculous. If you are going to charge that much for a special, you really need to say so ahead of time.

An alright place, but I think there are better on East 4th."}
{"text":"Unfortunately i have to change my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. I reserved for my birthday about two weeks in advance for a group of 8. When I got there, they didn't have a reservation under my name. They got it mixed up with another table of 8. We ended up getting seated in the private section which was cool since we got our own room. However, we stood at the front waiting for a table for at least 10 minutes. We ordered our food , the starters came after about 45 minutes, it was quite busy. Then our main meal came 5 minutes after we ended our starters. Not very organised. The food overall was mediocre, it was much better last time. It seems as though the menu has changed since last year....for the worse. The waitress Sonya was very sweet and basically saved the night. I would've probably given 2 stars if it wasn't for her."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The smell, as soon as you walk in, hits you in the face... The kabobs are cooked over wood, and smell permeates through the restaurant. Good food in the air, great atmosphere, and a taste that will knock the shoes off of you!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The appetizers were delicious - particularly the calimari and the eggplant dish and flatbread pizza."}
{"text":"Had a weekday work lunch at La Strada.  The restaurant had a nice interior with heavy Mediterranean features.  Even the interior, though, couldn't distract from the fact the the restaurant was nearly empty--which is a little unsettling and takes away from the overall experience.

I had the Pesto Omar, which is described on the menu as an \"errorless dish.\"  The name and description, it turns out, pays homage to former Cleveland Indian shortstop Omar Vizquel   The pesto dish was Omar's favorite at the owner's other restaurant, Little Italy's La Dolce Vida.  While I won't share Omar's enthusiasm, I thought it was a generally solid dish that will fill the appetite.

Among the choices on East 4th, all of which I've had the chance to sample, La Strada is clearly superior to the general fare of Corner Alley, PIckwick & Frolic, and House of Blues, but I wouldn't quite put it in the same air as Lola and, to a lesser extent, Greenhouse Tavern."}
{"text":"Hmmm...
Saturday April 14 for an 8pm reservation aaaaaaand...

Lesson learned!
Going out to dinner on E. 4th should be a memorable experience and this was, totally underwhelming....
I will be brief so the bullet points are:
got there early and grabbed a beer at the bar, I swear I must have been invisible cause I sat there, and sat there, and sat there..Then FINALLY the chick bartender barked a  \"what would you like\"...
\"How about YOU learning some basic bar skills\"?? Greet the freaken customer instead on keeping your eyes down.....Ooooooh that pi**ed me off...
Okay friends arriving and I feel better seeing them so we were led to our table upstairs. 
-Service stellar!!!
-Entrees not so much... I had a Calamari app and offer the benefit of the doubt that we are in Cleveland and GOOD Calamari is going to be tough to find so lets just say it wasn't bad. My salad was well constructed with a touch of feta--very nice--but really how hard is it to make a salad? 
My entree was the Fellini Fettuccine Bolognese and I can tell you this...I can make WAY better fett than what I had there...One would think they would either make their own or purchase local for that fresh quality one would expect considering price, location, reputation ect... But no because mine had that restaurant supply bought texture and sadly was under cooked; to compound the issue I could tell the plate sat in the pass for a while because the sauce firmed up making the entree stiff... Speaking of the sauce, it was unremarkable and just to be sure I tossed some on my friends plate and was also noted to be lacking...
Consensus? 
Not worth the grand  or so we dropped  so I highly doubt a return..."}
{"text":"Alright La Strada - the updated condensed Menu actually makes me feel like I'm having one culinary experience - Kudos!   Also, you have a nicely stocked Bar and the Bartenders are friendly and kind.  I'm starting to like this place a little more! 

But please, for your successes sake - speed it up!  I was there recently with a buddy, and we were the only two people in the restaurant for a good majority of the evening.  Why did our entrees take an hours to appear?  Granted, we were fine enjoying some drinks and chatting, but that just seems a little excessive.  Literally chefs ... you only had to work on our food.  You must have put a LOT of love into that food.  

BUT when it arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised!  I had the veggie kebabs, and they were rather tasty.  What is still in question is whether I enjoyed the food because it was actually good, or if it just exceeded the low expectations that I had when I ventured in.  

Either way, I'm upgrading to an A-OK.  I'll probably be back, lets be honest - it's within walking distance and has a bar."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Recommend the chocolate ball for dessert. It's also bring your own wine, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Decent food. Small, but proper, portions. Higher than average price.

Take a date here once when you want to try something new. Expect that you may not return.

Its not that the food is bad. I would just have a hard time going back as there was nothing that made my experience stand out.

They take reservations via Open Table."}
{"text":"I went to La Strata on a Saturday evening with my family to celebrate my brother's law school graduation. We were seated upstairs in a corner, which was cozy, unfortunately also very hot and sweaty. There was a big industrial fan attempting to cool the 2nd story, but central air could have certainly helped the situation. 

Our server seemed to be overwhelmed by how many tables she had, and the bus boys struggled to keep up. The bread was great. I enjoyed the beer selection. The pasta dishes that my family shared were good, but despite being good...it was underwhelming for the cost. I've honestly had better \"Mediterranean\" dishes at the Olive Garden. 

We asked for a second serving of bread and it took reminding our server 3 times for us to get the bread. It didn't arrive at the table until most of us were done with our meals, which was unfortunate. My boyfriend ordered a coffee and we had to remind our waitress 3 times (lucky number for her?) before the coffee arrived about 30 minutes later. 

It was okay, I suppose, but between the service and the mediocre food, I don't plan on returning. I have a feeling that if La Strada was located on a less busy street, like maybe in a strip mall, it would be out of business within months."}
{"text":"The sauces and the service are adequate but I consider it an embarrassment that they don't make their own pasta. You are basically paying $25 for mediocre dried pasta with a pretty good sauce."}
{"text":"Oh, La Strada...I SO wanted to like you. But alas, you are just average. The hostess was the high point. She was wonderful. But she couldn't mitigate the too-dark restaurant (which dimmed even more halfway through my meal)
I had a polenta special appetizer with green beans. The green beans were the star. The highlight of the meal. The pasta marinara, however, was just sad. No depth to the watery sauce. The boxes Orchette pasta was chewy and not in a good way. The sauce was greatly under seasoned and Strada does not put salt and pepper on the table...they need to...that was the only help for salvaging that sauce. Not only did it lack seasoning, but it was watery from the pasta and contained nearly raw onions. Sorry. Yuck.
My suggestions would be to turn on the lights so people can at least see what they are eating, taste the food before you send it out and please please please stop using pasta from a box. Especially if your going to charge more than $20 a plate.
What a wast of time and appetite."}
{"text":"The food on Valentine's day was tremendous.  Quite possibly the best calamari I've ever had.  Melted in my mouth and the sauce was rich and fulfilling.  The chicken parmigiana stood up against the standard of the well known dish.
Service was not good especially for the the price points of this establishment.  Server came back about 10 minutes after putting in our order and asked if we had put in an appetizer order.  We had.  Calamari took a long time to come out and the entrees were right on it's heels.  Had to request bread.  Asked for a fruity wine and it was definitely a dry wine.  Needed to break a bill and went to the bar and was told they had nothing smaller than twenties.  Having tended bar for a good stretch myself this is unquestionably a lie.  It's called checking the tip jar.  Manager also said they had no smaller bills and I advised I would wait until change could be procured which they eventually did.  That goes beyond poor service to unethical behavior.  They wanted to clip  the larger bill in hand.  
The service in general needs to be more professional for these prices.  Our server was too casual and good service is fairly easy to train people on.  I get the feeling management just doesn't care about the service if the dollars keep rolling in.  I should note the restaurant was maybe half full at 7:00 PM on valentine's day.   With all that said, I would definitely return for the calamari on the patio when weather turns as it was that good."}
{"text":"Great menu, great decor, and excellent service. My only complaint was the TV was a bit loud, but the Browns playing, so I guess it's to be expected."}
{"text":"La Strada is located on East Fourth.  It's features Italian and Mediterranean fare.  The prices are high and the atmosphere is trendy. The service is great and there's never any wait (in fact, a couple I know likes to go there for that reason alone).

FOOD.  They start you off with warm bread and dipping olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread tasted like it was very fresh, and I ate it all without any concern of spoiling my appetite.  I ordered a Spinach salad, which came with more balsamic, goat cheese, candied pecans and prosciutto.  Conceptually it was good, but  the ratio of spinach to everything else (including the dressing) was too high.  They needed to accessorize that spinach more.    I then ordered the vegetable kabobs.  Two skewers with Onions, Zucchini and Squash served on top couscous with more veggies and chick peas.  The veggies were well cooked and seasoned, and all was served with a side of this delicious sweet tomato topping.   A most excellent healthy, light menu choice.

Price - the salad was $11.  The kabobs were $15.  Value assessment: Too much coin for what I got. It was good, but not $26 good. 

SERVICE: I went in and sat at the bar, as I was rolling solo.  The bartender took my drink order and presented me with a menu, but there was some confusion as to who was actually my server. I ordered a salad from the bartender after getting her attention, and then my server came over to take my entree order.  Once the server figured out that he was taking care of me, the service was EXCELLENT.    

In summary, this place is great if you're looking for a place near the Q without much wait... and the food and service are above average, but not quite worth what you'll pay."}
{"text":"I recently visited La Strada for a party of sorts.  We had a lot of fun, but the service was awful.  The check was wrong.  I told the waiter it was wrong and he said something like, \"I don't know what you had, I just bring the drinks up.\"  Umm... we put all our orders in with you and you brought us the drinks.  This is your problem.  He wouldn't budge.  Finally, one of the members of our party paid part of the bill while I got the rest of the party off the dance floor to pay this guy--he was demanding we close our tab.  Everyone looked at the bill and couldn't make sense of what was on it.    While someone from the party may have split without paying, and we would gladly cover that, half the items we knew we ordered weren't on the bill.  It wasn't right from the get go.  He then told us to pay the full bill.  I reminded him that someone already gave him money and he played stupid until two other people corrected him and then he suddenly remembered.  I asked him to break a $20 and he couldn't do it.  So he took my money down to the bar to break it.  When he came back up he asked for the full check payment again and didn't hand me my money.  I had to remind him once more that someone already gave him cash for a portion of the bill and that I needed my $20.  Oh yeah, things suddenly became clear for him again.  We ended up putting all the money together and he asked once last time for the missing money.  DUDE!  WE ALREADY PAID YOU A PORTION OF THE BILL!!  A bill that was never correct in the first place.  Whatever, I'm pretty sure he didn't put a number of the drinks on that thing--we were actually trying to be honest at first but this guy just didn't want to cooperate.  I really wonder how much he actually collected from the people who left early--I'm pretty sure he was scamming us the entire time.  At this point, I'll not go back to La Strada.  It's not worth it, even for a regular dinner versus a party.  From what I could tell while sitting in the balcony above the kitchen, they use a lot of premade stuff.  Even the pizza crusts I saw them using were pre-made."}
{"text":"Je dois dire que pour cette première visite j'ai été très impressionné. 
C'est un restaurant assez chic a l'intérieur doté d'une belle terrasse face au canal de lachine mais les groupes sont les bienvenus. Le restaurant est abordable côté prix et en plus vous pouvez apporter votre vin. 
Nous avons partager une entrée de calamars. Frits juste point et accompagnée de la traditionnelle sauce tomate. 
Mon amie a mangé un délicieux veau à la crème.
Pour ma part ce fut le traditionnel linguini au pesto, huile d'olive et noix de pins. Simple mais délicieux. Plusieurs déserts étaient disponibles mais plus de place dans l'estomac. Le cafe espresso était egalement très bon. Les service par notre serveur David et son équipe de serveurs était sans reproche. Le stationnement était difficile."}
{"text":"Very good BYOW Italian restaurant located on the waterfront.

Food : absolutely fantastic. Real Italian food, lots of meats, homemade pasta and more. The desserts are amazing!! ASK FOR OFF MENU ITEMS!: Sometimes the chef feels inspired and makes something else! I had one of the best octopus at this restaurant! 
There are several other Italian restaurants on the waterfront in Lachine, this one is one of the best in my opinion.

Service : nothing short of excellent. Wait staff always tends to you and makes sure you are satisfied.

Decor : very simple, but elegant. Beautiful terrace with stone floor."}
{"text":"La Strada reminds me Julia Roberts in Eat Love.Pray.movie. It has all elements needed for success but somehow it doesn't work. Service is good, food is good, place is empty. Almost always except for occasional salsa nights. I do not remember any bad meals here but neither do I recollect anything phenomenal. One very sour Valentine's date and unremarkable New Year's eve later, I stay unimpressed. Just like in Eat.Love.Pray movie - was Julia Roberts there? Yes. Was she good or bad? Do not seem to remember. Good place to dine with the boss you don't like but only if it can be written off in taxes. And only if you eat calamari by yourself while he is in the bathroom. I hear they are too good to be shared here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and part of the hopping E 4 Street in Cleveland (apparently the only hopping part of town) and we liked our food.  It was loud, htough and hard to talk.  I had lobster risotto that was delectable.  My wife had a trio of eggplant appetizer that was wonderful.  She liked her lamb kebabs as well.  Our daughter had a salad and then a lamb flatbread pizza that she really enjoyed.  All in all, we were pleased."}
{"text":"Last weekend was our second time in La Strada. 6 of us went for our friend's birthday on Saturday night. We had an 8:00 reservation, and unbelievably, did not leave the restaurant until 10:40 due to poor service! We were so frustrated and annoyed with the lack of attention, and the ridiculous process of \"splitting checks\", that we did not even end up following the rest of our plans that night, and instead went home. The food is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced, and our server literally yelled our orders at us due to the noise in the restaurant. I will never go back to this restaurant and I urge others to support other more deserving restaurants that Cleveland has to offer. The fact that the owner was walking around to speak to tables did not represent a confident, friendly manager, but yet that he realizes La Strada is in trouble! It speaks volumes that the restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night, and 80% of the reviews on this site are negative."}
{"text":"My coworker and I departed our office at 11:30 on a Thursday and headed to East 4th. We only had one thing in mind: sitting outside and enjoying the weather. It being still rather early for the lunch hour we generally had our pick of restaurants - with the exception of Zocalo, which is where we originally headed until we saw the full patio. We ended up at La Strada, who had an empty patio save for one duo.

We walked into the patio area and the hostess inside looked at us rather blankly. After a few awkward moments, she wandered out and handed us the menus and told us we could pick our seat. As we looked over the menu a runner/bus-boy type brought us water and fresh bread wordlessly. The bread was fresh and warm; it had a flakly, crackling crust and a soft, airy interior. Do you remember that line in Ratatouille about good bread? Yeah, this was good bread.

I ordered the chicken flatbread: grilled chicken strips with avocado, pesto, roasted red peppers and lettuce. It was an excellent little sandwich; very flavorful and filling, yet light and refreshing. All of the food tasted very fresh and well seasoned. The flatbread came with a side of polenta fries, which were really interesting. They had a cornmeal type texture with a crunch and a very mild flavor. They were drizzled with the most delicious lemon aioli - I'd go back just for the aioli!

My coworker had the vagabando pizza: spinach, tomato, red pepper, red onion, kalamata olive, french feta, mozzarella. It was served on a thin, crispy crust similar to the flatbreak. It looked delicious, chock full of topics and loads of fresh, gooey cheese. She enjoyed it.

All in all it was a very nice lunch. The patio was wonderful. I felt refreshed and well fed. And without trying we managed to make it back to work in a little over an hour. We even scored some free Laughing Cow cheese on the way back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I have lived in Italy and I know real Italian when I taste it. I wished this restaurant was in Los Angeles so I could eat there all the time. The ravioli was impeccable and the side of fresh bread and olive oil was divine. Whenever I find a chance to go to Cleveland I'll make sure to stop here!"}
{"text":"Good choice for basic italian food - the A/C wasn't working inside so we sat outside. I'd say if you want some basic, decent italian food, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Great little spot near the Lachine canal. It is a BYOB and if I am not mistaken there is a SAQ not that far away. Food is simply amazing. Fresh, simple dishes are very well prepared and served fairly quickly.

The wait staff is super friendly and you can feel the vibe that they do enjoy working there and with each other.

The place at night is quite packed and can get very loud so am not sure if it is the perfect romantic spot for dinner. I would say it is much better if you are a large group."}
{"text":"La Strada is an interesting place. We came in on a Wednesday night and there were only two other tables, so the service was excellent. Our waiter, although brand new, was friendly and very attentive. The food was excellent -- I could tell that both my meatballs (which were huge) and the tomato sauce they were served atop were fresh, and my spaghetti was cooked to perfection. Our appetizer and pastas both came out quickly, although we did not get the complimentary bread so many other reviews raved about, and the young staff all stood around the bar talking loudly about sports, etc., which I found a little strange for the kind of place La Strada seems like it wants to be. Nevertheless, at the end of our meal, the owner's wife (I assume) came and spoke with us about our service, ensuring we were satisfied. Overall, a good decision."}
{"text":"I've given the restaurant two tries, and it's not impressed me.  In its defense, it does do a lot of simple yet interesting flavors.  If you go, get the calamari;  they keep the breading light and serve it with a rich, chunky marinara.  It's some of the best I've ever had.  

The service is so-so, but I've come to expect that from the over-capacity East 4th restaurants.  Order tall drinks and drink them slowly because it takes a long time to get something at the bar.

The movie \"La Strada\" being played on the wall is a nice touch.  It's unique, makes the restaurant feel more \"authentic,\" and does give diners something to do besides stare at each other.  However, a movie where the main plot points are human trafficking, violent revenge, and psychological breakdown might not be for everyone."}
{"text":"Had I not eaten next door at Lola the night before, this would have been a truly standout experience. I am blown away by the quality dining options in Cleveland. La Strada is a must visit. I had a perfectly cooked filet, but the star of the show is their paper thin slices of eggplant, lightly fried. Well done!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad writing this review, but I can find very little to compliment about this restaurant. I tried this place twice. The first time back in March, I went with some college friends and the only thing that I came away with in that experience was the over-priced food and bad service. 

This time, I went on a Tuesday around 8:30 with about 4 other people. I ordered the Lamb Flatbread as an entree, and had Calamari and Buffalo Mozzarella for the table. First off, the calamari was bad. Just very bad. It tasted like it had just be re-heated from the freezer. I will say that buffalo mozzarella was fairly good and tasted fresh. As for my entree, the lamb was bland and overly dry, and the flavors on the pizza were slightly off. My friend had the Americana Flatbread and she thought is was ok. No one at our table thought the food was that great, which is unfortunate since I love Mediterranean food. The value of the food your paying for is low, in my humble opinion. The one good thing was that the waiter was polite and did a great job serving us, even when we all asked for seperate checks and ended up having a complicated situation with the bill. 

I really hope that the kitchen can get the food under control and for the service to be more consistent - they have a decent idea, they just have to make it work, especially with all the competition that surrounds them!"}
{"text":"We went here during Restaurant Week. The place looks great, kinda like a wannabe cuban druglord's compound, with an old movie playing on a projector. Very cool. I felt underdressed here without a beard and commie cigar.

Unfortunately the food was excruciatingly forgettable and the service was insulting. 

It's hard to recover when your guests walk in to be greeted with a glare. Not a word, even after we asked for a table for 2. And it's not like we were rude or dressed in overalls, we're quite a typical looking yuppy couple. I was huffed at when I asked where the restroom was...sorry, don't people ever pee in fake cuba?

The fish was overcooked, dry and flavorless. It completely relied on its accompanying sauce, which was very flavorful. The veggies were overcooked but seemed fresh otherwise. 

The dessert was embarassing. It was one of those thawed frozen perfectly trimmed layer cakes with the paper slices that you can get at GFS or this place called Dream Factory. It's sad that desserts are so rarely found made in-house in restaurants anymore. But for the amount they're charging, you would expect some socialist worker pride put into it. In other words, flavorless - cold temps kills flavor and sweetness and if our cake could shiver, it'd rattle the table.

I didn't want to pay for the food, nor the service. But I did, because thedecor made me feel pimp for a day."}
{"text":"There was no heat in the restaurant, The food and service was good. But we froze while we ate. Some of the staff wore gloves,  Would of left but already bought the groupon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night around 815... place was pretty empty and the people that were in the restaurant were mostly just drinking and socializing. Nice vibe, but very dark and weird music that gets old real quick. Nice beer selection, some of which were new selections that I hadn't heard of. Appetizer of some Morraccan cheese was very tasty. Dinner... not so much. I ordered the chicken ka-bobs and it was a joke. 2 skewers that were about 7\" long. 3 small pcs of chicken on each skewer, maybe making up a 1/2 pcs of normal size chicken breast. There were a few green peppers and onion and one squash on each skewer. Very very disappointing. Even the spices were generic and overdone... you don't sprinkle just to sprinkle. All of this could have still been a 3-3 1/2 star rating, but the service was horrible. For the time of week and night we waited 10 minutes for waiter to introduce himself, as the bread guy brought out bread before the waiter stopped by. Took 45 minutes to get food and we had simple orders. HATE when waiters don't write anything down and then forget what you ordered. You impress me when you get my order right. Pricey too... $21 for the kabobs... maybe worth $6 if you are stretching it."}
{"text":"Went there last night. This is one great little Italian restaurant. I had a veal dish with Parma ham that was out of this world. My wife had pasta with clams. You could not find better in Montreal. The service outstanding , can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on the Labor day. I simply went there because there was no where to go - got pasta marinara. Guess what? I got three clam, shrimp, and some weird taste pasta for $24! 

I wouldn't be back there since the foods in the restaurant are very over priced and taste .... bad...."}
{"text":"Took a stroll down the red carpet (literally, there was an Oscar \"party\" next door to La Strada) on into La Strada for dinner tonight. As it was restaurant week (and who doesn't love restaurant week), I invited a few friends out to try a restaurant...and we all decided on La Strada.

It's a rather big open space. Tables are lined up somewhat in the middle of the restaurant with a projector on the side of the restaurant, portraying a sports game. 

With restaurant week, you get a choice of an appetizer, entree, and a dessert, for a measly 30 bucks. Yo, why not! I started off with the calamari for the appetizer. Although the actual quantity of the appetizer was rather appealing, the overall taste? It was a tad chewy, the sauce was kind of..meh..and yeah, just wasn't super great.

For the entree, I got the lamb shank, with couscous and some type of pear on top. The pear, when I bit into it was overpowering with spices, so I wasn't a fan. The lamb shank was relatively tender.... and the couscous was a tad overcooked, but still alright as well. Once again, quantity was huge..... but quality? Meh, it was alright. My friends got the swordfish and the steak.... they all said it was just \"okay\" as well.

For dessert, they got the baklava + gelato, and I got the poached pear soaked in red wine + gelato. The pear was okay.... rather hard to approach pretty- (I pretty much held the pear in one hand, and my spoon in another), and I didn't really taste the wine, but tasted good with the vanilla gelato. I took a bite into my friend's baklava...and man, that was dry. Take me back to Shatila Bakery, please.

All in all, this restaurant was okay. And quite the steal for restaurant week. That's..about it?"}
{"text":"Went here for a large group dinner. Food was very good (highly recommend the rack of lamb). Staff were very friendly and accommodating. 

However, the acoustics in this restaurant make it really hard to have conversations. They accommodate groups... But it seemed as if you could hear every single one of the dozen groups' conversations from your seat! 

Prices were around $40 a head and the restaurant is a BYO"}
{"text":"This place is tough to pin down... the outside kind of has a hip look, simple cinematic (recalling the Fellini film, La Strada), but the inside is going for a rustic, theatrical ambiance.  The wait staff seemed more like bar and grill people, but then the guy with the parmesan grinder was wearing a vest and classed it up a little.  There were tomatoes everywhere as decoration, which was neat looking, but also a little haphazard and strange.  All that aside, the complimentary bread is warm and delicious!  And every dish I've had there was pretty good.  I recommend the fettuccini fellini, the bolognese, the seabass special, the mozzarella appetizer, etc.  I give it a solid three stars, and I'd do three and a half if I could.  But the prices and ambience hold it back from 4 or 5."}
{"text":"I spent a really odd weekend in Vegas once.  I'd never been and was , well, coerced.  \"C'mon, you have to see it at least once.\"  I was told, as I was dragged, bound and gagged to the airport.  So I went.  And while I can't say my opinion of Vegas went from bad to good, I did gain an appreciation for the effort and craft that went into creating such an elaborate, surreal atmosphere.

I had that feeling when I stepped into La Strada.  The place was mindblowingly elaborate.  But what was it exactly?  It reminded me a bit of the French Quarter in New Orleans, a bit of an opera staging, more than a bit of Ceasar's Palace and Paris (the casino).  I noticed the crowd was similar to some of the fancier casinos-- well dressed groups of businessmen, some sultry cougars.  

Sadly, the waiter was not of the well-trained Vegas variety, and seemed rather clueless as to the finer points of the menu-- able only to repeat the descriptions on the menu.  As it was a Lenten Friday, we really had to determine what was meatless for ourselves.  If the menu was not specific, the waiter didn't know.

Ordinalrily, I eschew \"gourmet pizzas\".  They are usually over-priced, insufficently topped and terrible.  However, since the place is owned by the fellow who created La Dolce Vita in Little Italy, I knew I could trust the 'za.  I was not dissapointed.  The crust was thin, flavorful  and crispy and it was topped by a very generous amount of well seasoned spinach, artichokes and feta.  Num.  The size is generous for one person, yet I still managed to eat the whole thing.  

My Distinguished Guest had a very, very modest sized portion of linguine in a red cream sauce.  Very modest.  We both ordered dessert.  (My fault).  I had tiramisu, which was pretty good.  My DG had two of the itty bittiest, cutest little canoli.  Seriously, if it were not for the heaps of fantastic, crusty bread on the table--oddly served with butter instead of olive oil--  I think DG would have starved!

So, perhaps La Strada has a few things to work out in terms of service and portions, but all in all, it was a nice, if surreal lunch."}
{"text":"I couldn't put my finger on it while I was there but La Strada does have an identity crisis even though it is pegged as an Italian restaurant. Also what is up with the creepy face on the menu? haha! It is nice they have outdoor seating which is great for people watching on 4th and we saw a handful of weddings that evening. While it didn't bother me but did for my friend, our waiter had to bring another chair over from a 'side' table to accommodate our party and it only had one arm.

I'd say keep it simple for food. I ordered a beer and the Americana flat bread which has pancetta. Yum bacon. Everyone else was satisfied with their flat breads too. The appetizer bread was tasty  too as it was warm and had good olive oil and balsamic vinegar mixture. Nothing to write home about but the price was reasonable. Our waiter could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"I checked this place out for lunch today with a friend because I had a restaurant.com coupon. After today, I would definitely go back and happily pay full price. 

We were a little wary at first, because we were the only customers - an unusual sight for an East Fourth Street restaurant on a weekday. However, I don't think it was a testament to the restaurant - I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. 

First of all, the interior is stunning. I loved the tomatoes in the centerpieces, and I thought the curving staircase to the balcony was very charming and rustic. 

For my lunch, I ordered the wedding soup and a chicken salad. The wedding soup was delicious, but a very large order - too big to finish at lunch. The broth was incredibly light (similar to pho) and I enjoyed that it was a pasta-less soup. The poached egg was a nice surprise. 

The warm bread and butter was delicious of course!

The chicken salad was humongous and very fresh with lots of veggies. I wish I ordered it without the chevre, as it was a little strong for my taste (my idea of a good cheese is flourescent yellow and comes in individually wrapped slices). 

Our waiter was very attentive (especially since we were the only customers) and was a total dreamboat!

The menu was fairly large, but could be a little more descriptive of each of the items. I thought the prices were right on, even without a coupon.

All in all, I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Another 5 star experience. There is something to say for consistency and this place has it. chorizo chorizo chorizo. I love when it pops up to play a part in my meal. The hanger steak is served here with a few mini chorizo meatballs which are amazing. The 9 ounces of steak also comes with muscles and potato wedges in a spicy broth. All very good together. Again, this now being my 3rd time here, the place was not busy at all - odd. The only thing that annoyed me this time was a thing the waitress did. After you ordered and said you wanted she told you all the ingredients in the dish you just ordered as if you had not just read the menu yourself. Other than that a great experience and I'll definitely be back and hopefully some other patrons will be in too. And tonight I also noticed there is a movie screen on the left wall viewable from a few select balcony seats - not sure what this was for, but the old school Italian music, this old school movie and the Moroccan decor makes for a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our dinner was average. We had the eggplant appetizer and I thought it tasted like a mozzarella stick. For entrees, I had the vegetable kabob, which was burnt and a SUPER small portion. Note that I hardly ever even come close to finishing my meal and I managed to eat all of my food. My boyfriend enjoyed his seafood pasta, but was also not pleased with the portion size. With so many restaurant options in Cleveland, I will probably not be going back. The portions were small, the prices were high and the food was average."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing.  I'm sad about that, too, because when we were driving into town and looking on Open Table for restaurant menus near our hotel/HOB  the menu sounded amazing.

Our reservation was originally for five, but we called to push it back to 5:45 and they were incredibly nice about that.  When we arrived we weren't immediately greeted outside and so we went inside where a hostess with a rather dazed look seemed surprised to see us, but was pleasant-ish nonetheless.  There was NO ONE in the place and only one other table occupied outside.  We chose to sit outside and loved the kitschy tables.

Our waiter was not at all well versed in specials, the menu, or how to communicate effectively.  While he was nice, he didn't really seem to know what to do but I got the sense he wasn't new.  We started with wine.  Out came the bread and it was awesome - it came with an oil/rosemary/parmesan dip that was, sorry to say, the best part of the meal.  My friend had some wedding soup which was okay, but too salty.

We split the artichoke flatbread pizza and an order of veggie kabobs that was supposed to come with a greek salad.

The food took quite some time to come out but when it did the pizza looked a little differently than it was described on the menu.  Namely, no kalamatas.  Also, when biting into it it was covered in jalapenos which really didn't a.) go and b.) appear on the menu.  While I love spicy stuff, my dining companion does not.  More than this, though, it wasn't listed AND didn't go with the pizza well at all.  The pizza was mediocre at best.  The kabobs were okay but the eggplant wasn't properly salted before cooking and had that awful soapy/bitter taste that only comes from one thing: improperly prepped eggplant.  The \"greek salad\", which I expected it to be small, was missing some stuff.  It was just some plum tomatos (scooped, thank God, I can't handle tomato slime), red bell pepper, too much feta, a few red onions and TWO kalamata olives.  TWO?!

My dining companion complained about the pizza, and rightly so.  The waiter went to ask what was up and the answer we got from the chef (via the waiter) was that he \"decided to change it but didn't want to reprint the menus\".  Really?  Seriously?!  Ugh.

We were brought a free Tiramisu, which was bland so we didn't have much of it.

And they charged me way too much for my wine, but at that point I was pretty much done and took the overage out of the tip.  I'm usually not like that, but you know what?  Enough is enough.

I would, sort of, recommend this place for a drink and some apps outside if you've got time and patience and will carefully check your bill.  Skip dinner, though!"}
{"text":"We arrived at La Strada just before noon on a weekday. The hostess was very nice and sat us right away. The first thing we noticed is that we were the only ones in the restaurant which we thought was not a good sign. However, withing 15 minutes the entire restaurant was filled. The ambiance is first rate with small statues and sculptures, muted colors, and faux exposed brick behind stucco. Very inviting. The ceiling is painted like an evening sky and reminded me a bit of Ceasers in Vegas. It is a really nice touch as it makes the upstairs balcony seem like it is outdoors which is a very pleasant experience when it is 5 degrees outside. 

Any time I try a new Italian restaurant I order the pasta marinara. If you can't make a great marinara then you don't deserve to call yourself an Italian restaurant. The waiter was efficient and pleasant and I am happy to report that the pasta was very good. Cooked al dente with a light flavorful sauce. I even sopped up what was left with the Delicious bread. Being the sister restaurant of La Dolce Vita I had high hopes and I was not disappointed. Actually, the sauce seemed a little lighter and fresher at La Strada. A stronger flavor of basil which I really liked. 

Another important point is that we never felt rushed, but we were also out in time to get back to work within the hour we have for lunch. Nothing ruins a good meal like being ten minutes late for work and not even having the check yet (Metropolitan anyone?)."}
{"text":"We took some out of town guests here and were extremely disappointed in the service and the food. It was not crowded but the hostess had to act as our waitress and she wasn't familiar with anything.  Once we ordered, they didn't refill water glasses as necessary nor ask for more drinks.  Then when they food arrived, they forgot to put in one of the orders so one person didn't have a meal.  They did comp that meal when it arrived and brought complimentary desserts.  Overall, the food was fine but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Jaime bien se restaurant italien

{"text":"We went on a Monday evening, in which the place was slow.  Our server, Jud was excellent! The basil pesto pasta is very authentic and a must-have upon ordering. I had the garlic and basil aoli shrimp pasta special which wasn't short on the shrimp quantity! He had the Monaco Chicken off the menu, which was perfectly pan fried with very light breading. All were very very fresh and delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
