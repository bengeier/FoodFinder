{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. My favourite breakfast in Calgary, hands-down. We took my mum here for her birthday and she loved it. BREAKFAST POUTINE"}
{"text":"Delicious hashbrowns which should not be the star of a dish but they are so good! Interesting menu too - more than one thing I wanted to choose so I need to go back. 

Word to the wise - call ahead from home/work etc and have your name and cell phone number put on a wait list for a table.  They will then contact you when your table is about to be ready. 2 friends and I called for a table and were told the wait was 45 minutes.  It was perfect for us to grab coffee and drive from downtown and barely had to wait.  It is loud in there but the service was good and fast.  This is notably a good option in this area of town where there is little in the way of family restaurants that aren't fast food."}
{"text":"Good food however be aware the seemingly complimentary coffee they give you while you wait will be charged on your bill. I didn't even drink my coffee, just had the plastic cup at the table and we got charged as if I had ordered the coffee. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 4-5 times. Both on their busy weekend days and week days. I have to say that I'm very impressed with their service as well as the food. I have ordered the chicken and waffles and their egg bennies, both of which are amazing. On their busier days they are have a good system getting you in - and yes the wait times can be long - but once you're seated their service is on point. I also love their decor, and with all good decor packages, it enlists a feeling (which is this bright happy feeling if it makes in sense lol). Anyways kudos to these guys and hope that you guys keep the breakfast game strong in the NW."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast with artesian care and convenient location in the NW and worth the trip!!! Waffles are next level!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and found the food decent, but expensive for the area. The concept is great (supporting local farms ect), great decor and open concept. 
Being that it was Mother's Day we called ahead to put our name on the list (9:30am) and the girl were told that it would be around 45min-1 hour before we could get a table. We were texted a link and confirmation. We arrive at 10:20am as we saw were were 3rd in line and didn't want to lose our spot. Gil the manager confirmed our place as being 3rd. He asked if we wanted to sit at the counter and I figured we were 3rd so we would just wait. We waited until 11:20am I asked Gil how much longer (as at this point we had seen 7 tables being sat - tables that could have been split into 2 tops, couples with 1 baby taking up 4 tops, a family table with 4 empty seats) and he said he didn't know. I pointed out the hostess said 45-1hr and it's now been almost 2 hours since we had called. He said that was only an estimate and that we could have waited at home until we got a text from them (none of which was explained on the phone or on the website - so much for being considerate to the restaurant for being guests who show up when told to). I asked him how long until our table was ready he said he can't ask people to leave (which is completely understandable and not what I was asking for). He said a table just paid and we were \"next\" - a counter table left (the one who arrived after us with not being on the list and was now leaving before we were even sat). Guess who was offered the counter -again. At that point we just left. 
I had heard Gil taking to another restaurant manager admitting he didn't know how to run a reservations systems, seating - further he talked to another \"buddy\" saying that the no list system went down/crashed. 
Communication is key to ensuring guest satisfaction, on the phone, through the confirmation text, when we arrived we could have been told to look around the shops and come back when we got a text.  
Another note that the hostess \"J\" looked a mess, her jeans were filthy, fly undone, hair unbrushed, white shoes splattered with dirt."}
{"text":"A fairly small restaurant in the suburbs that's focused on indulgent breakfast items with some Filipino flair. Like many of the better brunch places in town, they source free range eggs from an old soulful farmer, etc.. They also have long queues for brunch but get bonus points for having a good system where you call, they give you an ETA so you can plan your drive, and they text you when your table is ready. 

First and foremost, the eggs are perfectly cooked. There's a guy in the open kitchen who's only job seems to be poaching and basting eggs. The service is quite good considering the number of covers they push through here. We had the sous vide fried chicken poutine and the short rib hash.  The meat in both was tender and tasty, though the short rib did not have the texture or taste we normally expect. The potatoes are fried in duck fat and live up to expectation. The rest of the components were acceptable if not outstanding. Unlike Caesar we didn't experience any GI distress after either visit, so I guess he's just unlucky. :-)

The restaurant has a number of non-ducky vegan options, so it's a good place to check out if you want to indulge and accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"This is our go to place because it's in our area. The food is consistently good! It will not disappoint you. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast! I had the chicken and waffel! Chick crispy and waffle fluffy/moist. Very good quality food. They have an app that will put you in line which is a time saver since they are usually really busy!"}
{"text":"Check out the waitlist info on their website and put yourself on it asap because their breakfast and lunch will knock your socks off. My eggs are always cooked perfectly, the duck fat hash is so yummy, and the coffee just keeps coming. I like their option for a wee waffle to start as I always struggle with sweet vs savoury."}
{"text":"Always very busy and for good reason. Luckily they have a stellar text reservation set up where you get a notification when they are ready for you which works great if you live close!

Food has never disappointed me yet. A favorite of mine is the breakfast poutine and my partner loves to share the waffles. 

Excellent coffee and the service is nothing short of spectacular! Genuine down to earth people who are approachable and helpful!"}
{"text":"Our first time. We went on the suggestion of a friend. I had the farmer's breakfast with over-easy eggs, duck fat potatoes, pork sausage patties, bacon and rye toast. My husband had the short rib breakfast. 
Positives: Fratello coffee and Mighty Leaf tea - awesome. The short rib was cooked beautifully. The bacon was sweet, but tasty. Great service.
Negatives: the pork sausage had zero flavour - it just tasted like a minced pork patty. The rye toast was under-toasted (soggy-isa), the eggs were under-salted - nothing worse than eggs without salt and there was none on the table. The bacon isn't crispy.
Overall, it was a good breakfast, with quality ingredients, but not exceptional. Nice to have some alternatives in the 'burbs for something different than the usual pancake house. Portions were generous. 
Our server was great and the staff are friendly. The atmosphere (we ate on a patio in a strip mall parking lot across from an oil change place) was not exciting. The resto interior seemed a bit better, but was very crowded so it didn't feel like a relaxed Sunday brunch type of place.

{"text":"We went to this great little place today and were totally impressed! We had a chicken frittata, hash and a kids dish....so delicious!!! Between the service and the food, we will definitely be back!
Highly recommend visiting this little gem!"}
{"text":"Food was only okay with nothing that really stands out in terms of choices and taste. Way too busy if you don't arrive early before the crowd. Price is a bit high for what you get but I guess breakfast has to be just as expensive as dinner these days."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. Rarely have I found a place that I thought Yelp had it under-rated.

It can be busy so go early or call ahead to reserve. I was lucky to be travelling by myself so I was able to sit at the bar. 

The service is great, everyone is very friendly. The decor is also really nice. I loved the choice for their booths with the plaid. It looked funky.

It was a toss up between the Eggs Benedict and the Short Rib Hash - I went with the server recommendation of the short rib hash. Amazing! It was by far the best breakfast item I've had in a restaurant. So delicious and so fresh tasting. You can tell everything is made in house and that they use quality ingredients. And I was impressed that they have a great selection of hot sauces. Fantastic! That made my day. 

Not only will I make it a point to return anytime I'm in Calgary but I will also be sure to recommend this to everyone I know. Don't miss out, check it out!"}
{"text":"Spent $20 for what should have been priced as a $6 sandwich and a $3 bowl of soup.  I get the impression they figure they are trendy so they can charge whatever they want.  That might work for awhile but people won't be taken twice.  I scoped out what was being served to other patrons and nothing looked like it should deserve the prices they charged for it. Should have gone to the Scotsman Well which is in the same area.  Bar food is better than this place.  On the plus side the staff was very pleasant.  Walk around the corner of the building and go to Timmies, same level of food at half the price."}
{"text":"One of the sunny side up eggs came broken, and hash browns were slightly burnt. The chicken and waffles were pretty good. I hear a lot of good reviews and will try the eggs Benedict instead of the traditional breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Busy little spot in the suburbs-Open faced avocado was very good. Would be awesome with a bit of goat cheese. Hubby had Mr Sausage baked frittata which was also tasty. Hash with duck fat didn't sound all that appetizing but was delicious! Friendly, fast service. Saturday morning lineups-recommend reserve online. But, Coffee & cake in the lineup if you have to wait is a nice touch.  Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"If you can ever get in here (more on that in a bit), the food magnificent. Hashbrowns cooked in duck fat, then thrown in a bowl with poached eggs, house cured bacon and delectable hollandaise? I'd eat that a hundred times over. 

But I can't. Why not? Because getting a table here for breakfast/brunch is a nightmare. Like most joints in Calgary right now with their no reso system, their \"waitlist system\" is laughable. You have to call about 1-2 hours before you want to eat, then you are put in a queue and then you just wait. And wait. And wait.

Think that you can roll outta bed at 8AM, call and get a table in a respectable time before you get hangry? Not gonna happen. 

Honestly, I'd love to try their chicken and waffles that everyone everyone keeps posting about but maybe I'll have to wait for the hype to die down. Don't get me wrong, I love food but I value my sanity more."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Excellent service. Try the short rib poutine.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place for breakfast/brunch, and one of the few places that offer waffle & chicken. A friend of mine recommended this place and I was impressed overall. It can get busy, make sure to arrive early to beat the rush. Great atmosphere, bright, and a good layout of the restaurant. 

The foods were all great, however, some may find the dishes on the heavy side or over seasoned. You may ask to have a low seasoning food especially the meats. They are fairly priced and can be satisfied by just ordering side items."}
{"text":"Great gluten free options. We've been eating here at least once a month for the past two years. The food is always great and the staff are welcoming and wonderful. Our favourite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Good food - fresh ingredients. Service was a little slow the day we went but they seemed short staffed and very busy. Had the salmon eggs Benedict. It was served on a waffle instead of English muffin. Was a nice touch. All in all decent meal - not expensive but not cheap. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food was not bad but at the end of the meal I realized I was given a dirty cup with lipstick stains on it... Felt disgusted and ruined my meal.  The waitress apologized and left it at that.  I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Getting a table to eat was a little bit of a hassle and I felt rushed to pay and leave.  But the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way through town. Excellent staff, atmosphere and food. I had the bacon Benni. The eggs were cooked just as I asked, that's rare these days. The coffee flowed loke wine and was delicious. Thwy even offer a cup to go. Thw only downside is it's a bit pricey ."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. Waffles were amazing, although on the smaller size. The eggs Benny was great as well. I fancy a heavier bottom like an English muffin rather than the waffles which crumbled after the yolk was broken. Messy but delicious. It can be pretty busy but if you put yourself on the wait list they will keep you posted on your spot. We were told a half hour wait but got in within 15 so not bad at all. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a great breakfast place like this close to home....usually for a trendy place like this you'd have to travel close to downtown.  It gets busy, so if you can go on a weekday, you'll have an easier time getting in.  If you go on a weekend, just plan a bit in advance, call in to leave your cell # and you'll get a text when your table is ready.  I love the decor inside.  The food is amazing.  The chicken & waffles are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  Fresh food.  Great bennies.  Lunchtime can get very busy so if going for lunch it's best to go around 1. A little expensive though."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. They have a very efficient call ahead wait system so you don't have to wait in person forever. My one warning is that there is very little on the menu that is healthy. But if you're down for some fried chicken poutine on top of duck fat fried potatoes, you will be in for a treat! Service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal there! Driving home from Banff to Edmonton and just picked it as it was the most convenient place to stop off the ring road. We were blown away by our luck! The food was amazing, we had the chicken and waffles and the short rib hash as suggested by our waiter (who was so awesome as well!) The coffee was rich and delicious. Really great vibe, we will definitely return next time we pass through!"}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast place. The food is always good and service is superb! The Chicken and Waffle was delicious, not dry and over cooked. I ordered a side order of homemade sausage and i got two toonie size medallions, which was disappointing and very expensive. I would skip that next time. Try their White Chocolate Lavender Sauce for your waffle...Delicious!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good reviews about this place so we decided to try it out on a weekday to avoid the weekend brunch rush. Glad we did since there was no wait when we arrived and only a few tables were occupied. Fairly quiet on a Thursday.

They are located in Evanston/Kincora in the Creekside strip mall where Tim Hortons is. Plenty of parking since they share a huge lot with all the business in that corner of the strip mall.


Our server was nice and super friendly. The food was great (I got the veggie Benny and my friend got the waffles with eggs).  We didn't wait long for our food after we ordered, which was great too. It tasted and all looked good. Portion sizes were good for the price as well. They have a great menu and there is other items I want to try next time. Will be back for sure.

Great place to come for great food and service! I highly recommend this place to anyone especially if you are in the NW."}
{"text":"Since my last time reviewing, this place has become one of my favourite breakfast places in town. The serving sizes for bigger although I was told they hadn't changed - I compared photos, they had. The prices are slightly higher but we'll justified by the quality and service. I love the breakfast poutine and eggs benny"}
{"text":"First time coming in, got lucky and snagged two seats at the bar which was fun getting to watch all the craziness of the chefs in the kitchen. Plus you got to see all the awesome plates coming out which made me want to order everything. 

We had the short rib hash and the bacon Benny...both were awesome, not one complaint. Eggs on the Benny were done perfectly which is a feat in its own considering the amount of eggs one guy was poaching. 

Being able to text in your name for the wait list so you don't have to wait around is a bonus and something we will take advantage of WHEN we come back (which lets be honest, won't be long).  

Great little establishment."}
{"text":"I have so much love for this place. I never like going back to the same restaurants, ordering the same menu items... until a toddler and the suburbs happened a year ago, and this place opened nearby. 

You won't go wrong with anything on the menu and I must have eaten the chicken and waffles about 20 plus times now. They are pretty kid friendly and serve up a downtown brunch minus the parking headache and snotty service.  Food is really good quality. They have menu items to please the health nut and people like me who think people who avoid fat are untrustworthy.

Also a shout out to their outstanding lavender latte, please don't ever take this out of the menu. 

Service is always wonderful, with or without the toddler. This is the place we take all out of town visitors who come by Calgary, if only to prove we have not been living in a cave since becoming parents and still know how to eat well.

I would personally like to see some kind of seasonal menu or even changing up menu items a little bit."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago we decided we wanted to have a nice breakfast out.  After looking through reviews and seeing how much others enjoyed this restaurant we thought we'd give it a try.  Upon arrival we found it to be jam-packed to overflowing which was a good sign, with a 20 min wait for the bar or a 1hr wait for a table.  We chose the bar, which gave us a good view of the cooks.

The atmosphere was a bit chaotic but it was busy so that's no surprise.  The wall nearest the entrance had writing all over it and some of it was hard to read, but the place overall looked very clean.  Our seats were announced via text which was great because we wouldn't have heard our names called over the din.

After perusing the menu we ordered chocolate milks (because we saw someone else's and they're HUGE).  Derek had the Upstream Benny and I got a House Cured Bacon Breakfast Poutine with the eggs scrambled because I don't like poached (runny) eggs...

It was a little bit of a wait, so we were halfway done our delicious, enormous chocolate milks by the time the food arrived but I'd noticed something interesting.  The first time the eggs were done and put on top of the hasbrowns, he spied something that he took out of the dish, along with the eggs, and had them re-fired.  I really appreciate that he caught whatever it was and replaced the ingredients before it could be brought to me.

Now the dish itself...  The duck fat hash on the bottom was divine...Honestly anything cooked in duck fat has such rich amazing flavour that it just made the potatoes perfect.  The eggs were well-done just the way I like them with a dusting of something I think might have been paprika...the roasted garlic hollandaise was really creamy and blended great with the eggs and giant chunks of bacon.  Part of me wanted more sauce, and part of me kept saying \"no way, this is rich enough!\"

It was so delicious I can't wait to go have it again, when I'm hungry enough to handle it.  The portion sizing had us leaving full, without any need for extra sides.

As we were paying the bill the waitress let us know that their text-based table notification doesn't just work when you get to the restaurant, you can call in advance and they'll let you know in time to drive over.  That's so fantastic I wish more restaurants offered that kind of notification service.

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast and brunch is the most fast and furious time of the day, what with all of the people in a hurry to start their day, the prospect of a full day of work ahead, and the fact that most people haven't eaten since the night before. In contrast, some folks, like us who are in the food industry, find ourselves usually off on Mondays or Tuesdays. We savour our solace, looking for the the perfect place to just chill while the rest of the world whips around us at breakneck speed. 

It is comforting to know, that no matter what world I'm currently in, I can rely on brothers Gil and Jeff Carlos to deliver an experience that exceeds expectation and makes me feel right at home and perfectly content in my moment. Upon being greeted with a warm welcome, I pull up a chair and have a fresh cup of Fratello coffee, locally custom blended and roasted for the Bro-kin Yolk. As I read through the morning's emails or peruse the morning paper, the place is alive with conversation and banter from the customers and cooks in the open kitchen. Being a chef myself, I enjoy sitting at the bar so I can have a front seat to all the action.

The menu is a simple, yet solid breakfast and lunch selection featuring the classics like Farmer's breakfast, homemade hash and sausage, to waffles, poutine, and eggs benny. All of these delicious selections feature super fresh local ingredients and the most beautiful eggs you will ever see. Such rich golden dark yolks that taste sublime, needing only a simple seasoning of salt and freshly ground black pepper. 

From an industry perspective, breakfast is the toughest service of the day. It's fast, intense, and unforgiving. It can eat a young cook alive and spit him out. Add to this the fact that you are working with the most delicate of ingredients...eggs. It takes a keen sense of timing, organization, creativity, and patience to do all the wonderful things you can do to a humble egg. Chef Jeff has a good crew that brings the utmost professionalism and attention to detail to every dish. 

I support local businesses with all my heart. Passion really goes a long way when a business owner makes the huge decision to invest in a community and become a part of it, servicing and contributing to its whole and becoming an integral institution, whether its fixing cars, cutting hair, or serving up breakfast. On the other hand, I have seen business owners that come in with the wrong intention, finding the best place to make the most money, and wonder why a short time later, they're finished.

It's with a great sigh of relief that I can say that I'm glad that Gil and Jeff have found a home in their community to operate and grow their business. And it is my recommendation that if you are lucky enough to live here, to take advantage, drop in, have a cup of coffee, and find your moment here at The Bro'kin Yolk."}
{"text":"Let me start out with how impressed I am with their phone-in waiting list!!!

Thats right people. Finally a place in Calgary that will let you call ahead, ask how long the wait is, and put your name on the list to get a text when your table will be ready in 5min. The hostess clearly stated to me that we needed to respond to the text and if we were delayed the next people in line would get a table but we wouldn't loose our spot. Amazing! Thank you for not making me stand in the entrance of a breakfast spot blocking it for everyone else - if nothing else but this I will definitely go back.

Now this is not an area I normally get to for eating but as a friend lives up there it all worked - happy to have options out of the norm places that serve breakfast.

I had the Oscar Benny - thick cut ham, wild mushrooms, great garlic hollandaise and added spinach (not an issue at all). Instead of english muffin they used 1/2 of their mini belgium waffles for each egg. Really nice spin on the regular, they were nice and soft yet held up to the yolk. My friend tried the bacon benny - had a taste and equally as good.

The boyfriend decided to try the chicken & waffles. Now as he hates maple he didn't have the sauce so no idea how that tasted. Unfortunately he also didn't realise the waffles had maple syrup in the batter (not indicated in the waffle description so not really his fault there). Admittedly he got over that and even he admitted the waffles were good.

Now were there could be improvement on the dish is definitely in the flavours they use in the coating on the chicken. It was crisp and chicken moist but the coating really didn't taste too much of anything. Not expecting Colonel Saunders style flavours but literally couldn't taste a space. Feel like if he had the sauce with the chicken we may never have noticed but this is definitely something the kitchen to improve on.

Couple of interesting twists on the beverage options too which was nice to see. Food came much quicker than expected seeing how busy they were - think it was 15min after we ordered. Service was fast and attentive. Plus they have those really cute little ketchup bottels working in their favour too.

Will we be back? Yes
Do I think they are doing an amazing job for being open 2 months? Yes

Keep it up guys, its fantastic to get breakfast boutique food in the middle of NW suburbia!"}
{"text":"First off - I love that this place is in the deep nw.  We need more of this quality restaurant up here!!

The staff are friendly, and I love the fact that you can call in and get into the wait list and they will text you when it's time to leave your house.

As a Dad with two kids, it's super refreshing to go to a place that's loud, and kid friendly.  I don't have to worry about my kids making strange noises and getting 'the look' from people who don't realize that kids aren't dogs.  

The food is quite well done, but not amazing.  We've been a few times and my complaint is that it seems they are a bit rushed and as such the quality slips a bit.  Potatoes are typically overcooked, and most dishes are a little on the greasy side from oil or butter.  With all of that being said, the coffee, the food and the atmosphere are way above the average in our NW communities.

Just a small amount of focus and this place could be 5/5.

Ignore the clowns that say the place is too pretentious, those dorks clearly belong in humpty's with my grandma and grandpa.

I encourage you to call ahead and get on the list, you'll enjoy yourself much more than waiting nearby.

Cheers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here, however the wait times can be extremely long.. they don't take reservations but you can call in and put your name on the waitlist  which can be up to 2.5 hours.. The servers are nice and friendly. I was disappointed with receiving complimentary coffee while you wait for your table but then getting charged on your bill. The coffee is really dark, for a breakfast place they need a lighter roast! My fav items include the mushroom benny and compote for the waffles, arugula salad has a nice truffle flavor!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special however. I found the menu quite repetitive and did not have many choices. I don't think I will come back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem!   It's all the breakfast classics with a nice twist.  

We were here on a Sunday morning, for a breakfast place, that means the busiest part of their week.  We walked in with no reservation to find probably 30 people in the waiting area.  We asked how long it would be and were told about 45 minutes, to which they also informed us of their table notification system.  

There is a ton of companies and restaurants that use smart phone tech to make things faster and easier but due to poor implementation it usually is more of a pain than it's worth.  Not with this place!  It is VERY well done and couldn't be easier.  We gave our numbers and were told that we would receive a 5 minutes notice for our table.  We wandered around the complex a bit and after 10 minutes time we were notified and seated at a table.  

As we walked I noticed the kitchen wide open and a number of young people working the kitchen (maybe 18 years old).  For such an impressive menu, my heart did sink a bit assuming the average level of experience across the group.  I know, I know I shouldn't assume.  After watching the kitchen crew for a bit I was quite impressed at the level of quality they were putting out.  Their expediter was sending stuff back every now and then, stuff that I would have eaten just fine.  High standards!

Needless to say our meals were fantastic."}
{"text":"Finally a brunch place in NW ... Food is good!! Had the waffle and chicken and it was cook to perfection."}
{"text":"I live close by to restaurant and its always super busy til one day was able to get a table I thought it was gonna be great but it really isn't all its cracked up to be! Rather go to a Dennys or smitten then waste extra money for worse food"}
{"text":"Walked in with no reservation on a very busy Saturday, 3 children and 3 adults and we are seated in about 15 minutes which is excellent for a Saturday brunch time.
The restaurant was packed and we still had excellent, cheerful service and the wait time was reasonable for such a busy place.
I had the apple pie waffle, it was fluffy and delicious, the apples, cream, pecans yummy ... Quite an indulgence. Ordered a medium poached egg on the side and it was coined perfectly. My toddler had the French toast which was gone very fast and then he wanted more rather than his fruit of course. Another of the adults had the chicken and waffles and enjoyed that as well."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast place in Calgary ! My family and I and my boyfriend and I go on the regular. The manager/owner is always working and very friendly and personable this is something amazing to see on the floor of a restaurant. The staff are all amazing and so many of them have been there since they opened! 
My biggest advice is to call ahead and add your name to the wait list as it is regularly 1-2 hour wait especially on the weekends ! 
The food is all amazing and the coffee is as well! 
During the summer there is also a patio outside! Very nice to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Located on the way to Banff national park from Calgary, this little place along the highway is a perfect spot to stop for breakfast or brunch as you head out for the amazing wilderness of Banff! This place is very upscale and modern.. The ambience is very cozy and intimate and we sat on the counter top facing the kitchen! The site of the food being prepared was a delight in itself..it was very difficult to choose from the menu as every option looked amazing - we finally ordered the French toast fondue and the mini waffles along with sides of sunny side up and the breakfast potatoes. The food was delicious and the service first class! Definitely give this one a try."}
{"text":"My brother found out about this new place last week and asked me to join him for brunch today.  He called to make a reservation, was told they don't do that but instead will text him when a table becomes available right away.  It took about 1.5 hours as the place was packed!

I was really looking forward to the chicken and waffles, and then found out they only make 20 portions a day.  This was not stated on the menu anywhere... kinda wish it was.  This was a serious disappointment for me.  I probably would not have came as I came specifically for that.  I did not want eggs so settled for the burger with the salad as a side, while my brother and his gf both got the farmers breakfast and got my toddler the grilled cheese.

As busy as they were, the food came out at an acceptable time and our server checked with us twice to make sure we didn't need anything else.  The farmers breakfast was a fantastic deal with healthy portions! Knowing that they cure their own bacon, I was very excited to try it and it was really good (however, I could not taste them at all in my burger).  Eggs had that lovely orange yolk.  My burger on the other hand was not that good.  First of all, the patty was cooked to well done, which is totally fine.  It was cut in half, which I appreciate.  However, it was then placed under the heat lamp for a short time while they made sure all of our dishes were done and well, that dried out the meat.  I think mayo or some kind of aioli would've helped but yes, my burger was quite dry.  It wasn't inedible so I didn't send it back, but I definitely would like it to be juicier.  The salad had this lovely light strawberry basil vinaigrette that I really enjoyed - would definitely get that again as a side.

One of the owners, Gil, came by at the end to check us out and he remembered my brother creeping their window last week.  It was a nice gesture for sure, but would've been nicer had he chatted with the rest of us, too.  Maybe it's a guy thing.  I do still want to try the chicken and waffles, but will probably have to come right when they open to ensure availability."}
{"text":"Not bad.  We tried veggie hash and chicken poutine.  Chicken was dry and not a lot to the dish.  Veggie hash was really dry.  I know these little breakfast places are the new talk of town but honesty humpty's is better.  I think the best part of our meal was the farm fresh eggs and our server !"}
{"text":"Getting a table is weird . We were encouraged to call ahead to get our name on a list and received a link to a website that posts our place in line. It's neat and it seems like a good idea since it considers our wait time. However, when I called as asked for an approx time, I was told it would take about an hour, which was fine because we were driving from the other side of the city. But when we arrived our place barely moved so we spent the majority of our wait at the Tim Hortons next door. I was hungry so I had a coffee and a donut. When our place said we were next, we still had to wait fifteen minutes before we were sat down.
Overall, it took two hours from when I called to put our name down to when we finally sat down to our table. Maybe they're working towards shaving the wait time down, but then again Bro'Kin is in a prime area.

But the service was great. We didn't have to wait long to get our food after we ordered. My guess is that from the decor and the vibe, people just like to hang around and chat and whatever it is that makes people spend 4 hours of their day off \"brunching\". I saw the same faces of people sitting at the tables from when we walked in the door to when we left it. There's something about the place that makes you want to hang around for as long as you want. And if there was one thing yuppies and hipsters had one thing in common, it's loitering.

The food was largely a hit with a few \"mehs\". The braised short rib poutine was balls to the wall packed with flavour. Something about how the meat that made it taste like the most flavorful corned beef I've had in my childhood. The chicken and waffles are list-worthy (and it's about time Calgary started a list of it's Chicken and Waffle spots). The chicken was crisp and seasoned with a slight touch of sweet and spice. But that gravy, gawdamn I wanted to lie to my GF and tell her it was cold and flacid so I could have the whole thing to myself. Although I wasn't impressed by the french toast fondue. It really wasn't a fondue and should have been named \"ok french toast with chocolate sauce and berry sauce on the side so you can be ok with your life's decisions.\"

Also I'm being too much an old man over the title. Had I been born in the 60's and had cardigans and bostonians in my Sunday casual, I'd be complaining about the title...but I won't so whatever...shuttup."}
{"text":"Called in for a reservation, and the table was ready for me upon arrival. The customer service here is a definite 5/5! From the moment I walked in, to when I left, everyone was so friendly and helpful. The menu has a great variety to accommodate everyone's taste. The avocado open face sandwich was alright, but the balsamic was too over powering. I recommend you ask for less balsamic if you want to try it. We ordered a side of sausage and there was about 4 slices (not whole) and we paid $3. 

The location is super convenient and overall a great atomosphere inside! A definite must-try in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Heard really great reviews of this place and saw that the French Toast fondue was one of the must haves in Calgary before you die. Was really disappointed the French Toast lacked flavour and I thought the Nutella dip was almost \"liquory\". The mixed berry compote was very tart. I don't think I would order this again. That being said there mini waffles are awesome. Very light and fluffy have some very tasty dips to go along with them as well. The salted Carmel is terrific. Also tried the eggs Benny and it was very good. Served on there waffle. Potatoes were cooked well. Disappointed in the French Toast fondue but was happy with the other items I tried ."}
{"text":"This place is very close to where we live. Quiet busy all the time. Normally we go there and put our name down and they text us informing when the table is ready. I loved their waffles. They are small in size and less batter used so they are light but still fluffy. I chose to have their white chocolate syrup which is absolutely amazing.  I have never tried chicken and waffle until here. I must say it was actually good. They used different waffles for this dish. These waffle are bigger and fluffier. They serve with two different sauce, maple honey hot sauce and chicken white gravy. This dish tasted  like bread with chicken so I did not mind. Their egg benny is really good specially the salmon one. Service is really quick and staff are really nice. They are always coming around tables and asking their customers if they needed anything. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service and nice atmosphere.  Just be sure to call ahead so you don't wait in line."}
{"text":"Our family wanted to try something different, so here we were!  One of the owners, Gil, explained their namesake: \"Bro\" for brothers with family (hence the \"kin\") and their breakfast specialties, eggs Benedict (\"yolk\").     I ordered the fried chicken and waffles and really enjoyed the crunchy coating and juiciness of the chicken. The white chicken gravy was a bit bland for my taste but I loved their sweet and spicy syrup.  Our son ordered the truffle and wild mushroom poutine(and cleaned his plate) while hubby had the upstream Benny with smoked salmon.  
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Instagram and decided to check it out. After looking over the menu online and reading their story, I had rather high expectations, which were heightened further when I heard \"You Gotta Eat Here\" was going to be filmed there the following week. Unfortunately, these weren't quite realized. The restaurant was a little difficult to find, as there wasn't a sign at the entrance to the plaza and we weren't quite sure which way to go. The decor was really cute and we had no trouble getting a table (but we did come early). Neither one of us was quite hungry enough for a big breakfast, so I ordered 3 of the mini waffles and my boyfriend got the french toast fondue. He also ordered fresh orange juice to start before his coffee, which never came. The waitress was very friendly but it looks like they're still finding their groove on the staffing front, which is normally the case with new restaurants. When the food case, a different server brought our order and I ended up with 4 mini waffles instead of the 3 I ordered (which I did get charged for when the bill came). The cortado my boyfriend ordered (and talked the waitress through the process of making properly) also wasn't quite what it should be. My waffles were ok but a bit dry because, it turns out, they only come with a sprinkling of icing sugar. I did order a fruit compote as a topping but it came on the side in a tiny little bowl and was only enough for one of the waffle pieces. This is not something the server advised me about. There was no maple syrup provided (it wasn't even an option to order as a topping on the menu). Overall, I found the experience disappointing in light of my expectations. It was ok and we might give them another try for the eggs and duck fat hash once they get their groove a bit. For the time being, however, when I look at the type of food and the price range, I've had better."}
{"text":"First time I visited, they told me 1.5 hour wait for a table for two on a Saturday at 1pm. I was hungry already and didn't have the patience for that, so we left. 

Second time I visited, we were aware there would be a wait. 1 hour wait for a table for two on a Sat at 11am. We put our name down and wrote down our phone number and they said they would contact us via text when our table was ready. 

Symons valley ranch is near by, as well as a Starbucks so we did that in the meanwhile. They texted me an hour later saying my table would be ready soon so we headed back. When we got back to the restaurant, they asked us if we wanted to be seated at a big table with other people. What is this, HK? We said no and they told us we had to wait longer for a table for two. Why couldn't they have asked me that via text? We had to stand around for another 10-15min before a table for the two of us was ready. 

There is a good amount of variety on the menu. We ordered the bacon eggs benny with butternut squash soup on the side and the short rib hash, as well as two mini waffles on the side with two toppings - salted caramel and dark chocolate espresso. The place was obviously very busy, but our food took another good half an hour to come out. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the eggs benny. My favourite part about the benny was the garlic hollandaise sauce. I really liked the garlic flavour in it, it made the dish so much more savoury. I had mixed feelings about it being served on the same waffles I ordered as sides. I think it just depends on personal preference. I forgot I had the soup until I checked my pics for this place, so the soup was good but nothing amazing. 

The short rib hash was also good. The short rib was on the saltier side but with the hash, it was fine. 

The mini waffles were good but not sure if worth the $2 price tag. The toppings were pretty good though, I think you don't need one topping per one waffle as the portion of the topping is more than enough for 2-3 waffles (waffles are tiny). 

Overall the portions for the food seemed a little small for how much they were priced at.

Our hostess and our server was both very pleasant. But the way they were managing the tables seemed horrible. I saw some large groups of people who were clearly upset by the wait. The guy at the front managing the waitlist seemed a bit flustered. It made me feel like the place was very unorganized and chaotic. 

LONG REVIEW SHORT, I like the food here but I don't think I would wait 1 hour to eat here. Long wait for a table, more wait times for food. I'll try visiting again on a weekday maybe but definitely not again on a weekend. I will also probably wait it out for the big opening rush to phase out a little."}
{"text":"Best spot this side of Stoney, breakfast or otherwise.

It's pretty rare to find a trendy spot like this outside of downtown but BKY hits all the notes. That means the good ones (great food, great atmosphere, great service), and the bad (long waits, higher than average prices for a breakfast place in the 'burbs).

The owners truly care and (often) that reflects through the staff. We've been there over half a dozen times and the people working have been 90% fantastic. Honestly, people are human, you might get a rare average experience with the staff but it won't happen twice.

As far as the food goes? I probably kill 4 cups of coffee minimum, as they serve a special blend from Fratello (same folks responsible for Analog coffee shops, for those familiar). Pretty notable highlights otherwise include the Chicken & Waffles (best I've had in Calgary), Farmer's Breakfast, French Toast Fondue, and the Breakfast Poutine.

It's a trendy spot, but not conceited. Bring your friends, bring your kids, or just go by yourself and sit at the bar.

NOTE: I've seen some complaints about cost. Things are fresh and local here, so with that comes higher food cost. That said, the cost is FAR from outrageous. Anyone used to previously frozen/packaged and warmed up stuff from Tim's or Denny's is going to notice a difference here. It's up to you to decide if it's worth it."}
{"text":"I met my friend here for breakfast on a weekday morning after I had just finished a night shift. I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation - and I was told to come down as there was no wait. We did this and we were seated right away when we arrived. 

Our server was attentive and at our table immediately. They unfortunately do not have decaf drip coffee but they did have cappuccino and latte decaf options for me. The server did not let our drinks get empty before asking if we would like more, which we were impressed with. 

We ordered the Farmers breakfasts with us one being gluten free and they were attentive with asking if it was for a celiac or just preference to avoid cross contamination. The food was generally very good but the gluten free hash a little undercooked. 

Would return."}
{"text":"I totally enjoyed my brunch here.  I appreciated being able to put my name in a waitlist by calling ahead- no wait at all for our party of 3!   Fratello coffee served was delicious.  I enjoyed my vegetarian benny with the tasty slices of eggplant, perfectly soft poached egg, yummy waffle and hash browns cooked in duck fat- really enjoyed this.  But what I think I liked more, was the bite from my friend's chicken and waffles dish- the chicken was amazingly spiced!  I will def return for the chicken and also need to try the vegan hash.  Worth the drive to this far, far suburb?  Well I already live close to awesome options such as OEB, blue star, diner deluxe....so if I am already up in that area, def need to return here and make a morning of it!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some good breakfast this morning so decided to give this place a try.  They don't take reservations so it's best you call in and get your name on the waitlist, and for our family of 5 it's a wise choice.  Even with the waitlist we waited for 20 mins which isn't too bad.  The service is good and the folks are friendly.  Most importantly the food, I had the Oscar Benny, eggs were poached perfectly, the mushroom added something exotic, Sauce was okay, not memorable, and the waffle was soft, not crispy on the outside the way it should be.  The hash with duck fat was twice fried and perfect with the coarse sea salt.  Kids had the little farmer with egg, ham, has and one piece of toast.  They enjoyed it.  The baked apple pie waffle looked good but then again the waffle was soft but considering what you got I think this was the item that was over priced.  The Mr.Chicken frittata was okay, nice presentation with the skillet but I think the veggies are too chunky.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I had the Vegan Hash and it was sooo good!
The service was very good too.
It was the best food I had when I was in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I love a good hearty breakfast and thought to give this place a try. The service was good. We got a table quickly. My coffee stayed full. But when it came to ordering our food it was a bit more challenging. My son wanted waffles for breakfast but they are very pricey. For two dollars you get a quarter of a waffle. He usually can eat three whole waffles. Plus they charge you extra for Syrup and topping. I ordered the farmers breakfast which was a better value. The farmer sausage tasted strange though. The cappuccino was very tiny for the four dollars I paid. Next time I'll just get drip coffee. There are a few other places that we prefer."}
{"text":"I recommend the bro'kin burger and the duck fat hash browns"}
{"text":"Awesome!! The food is out of this world, brunch at its finest. Hash browns fried in duck fat - how can you go wrong! It's a great little spot, with a classy and fun atmosphere. Service is great, all the girls are super nice. I would eat here everyday! Probably a good idea to make a reservation, they're always super busy! Definitely get the bite see waffles and all the dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"We went on a regular week day. Called to reserve a table but once we got there, we waited for another 5-10min again. The food was good in general. Better than the last time I went since it was less salty. And whoever needs more salt can easily add more. Their coffee is pretty strong and bottomless. However, I found the price sightly more here in general in particular the beverages (considering the portion). The only issue I have with this place is the lack of vege and fruits. It's highly fatty and meat/egg based. We knew we were in to fully satisfy our fatty food craving! Will be back again. Hope they'll have some new items to choose from then to change things up!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, but a bit expensive for a breakfast place. I ordered the Fried Chicken poutine and it was delicious but it was a little salty. My wife mistakenly ordered the mini waffles and was served a quarter waffle. Good enough for a side or a quick appetizer but not as an entree.  Was a bit surprised the sauces were extra. We waited 30 minutes for a pair of bar seats. The place was packed and very loud and noisy. If you want a quick bite here, forget it. If you want cheap food here, forget it. If you want a gourmet breakfast, then yes, eat here! Service was great and coffee flowed fast. The menu is filled full of exotic breakfast options, so it is worth trying it out."}
{"text":"As good as everyone says. High end version of breakfast needs imagination if I am going to pay more than $10. This place gives you that! Nice to get the feel of a downtown brunch without going all the way downtown! Get there early ;)"}
{"text":"Bro'kin Yolk reminds us of having brunch in Los Angeles, the atmosphere in the kitchen was very alive, the waitresses were all very friendly and the restaurant was filled with people. 

We sat at the bar beside where the food came out.  IMO that was the best seat in the house because you get to see all the food that comes out of the kitchen...and they all look delicious!  

Will definitely be back!  So happy we have a place like this in the North!"}
{"text":"They were busy -- as in hopping -- when we tried them out on a Saturday morning, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table, and after we ordered our food came out quickly. Long story short, they sure know how to make Eggs Benny with smoked salmon. Super friendly service and a positive, high energy vibe. Now I know one more place for brunch that starts your weekend off just right."}
{"text":"Service was great, however the restaurant is very small. Felt very cramped and uncomfortable. The food was ok, portions very small. Waffles were generic and bland , however the bacon was so delicious! The single serve ketchup was cute. Oh the coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"The Bro'kin Yolk is a fairly small, independent breakfast restaurant up in creekside. We got to Bro'kin Yolk around 10:30am and had to wait for an hour for our table - they get very busy. The restaurant implements the text back system when your table is ready so that you can go run errands or grab a coffee at tim's or Starbucks nearby but the owner also mentioned that you can call from home, check the wait list time and put your name on the list from home! I actually love this idea and we clearly would have done that if we had known. 

The restaurant, itself,was quaint and staff were friendly, especially the owner who made a point checking on patrons regularly while they waited. Our food came fairly quickly once we ordered - chicken and waffles and Oscar Benny - and it was all delicious. These were probably the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. Extra bonus for Bro'kin Yolk is that they have fresh squeezed orange juice, which was great and it came in a decent sized glass. I will definitely be back here for breakfast the next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"I'm currently visiting from the West Coast and Bro'kin Yolk was recommended by my cousin. The ambience here is super casual and friendly and the staff is so attentive. I really got my dollars worth of coffee for sure! The food here is great and I really like their duck fat hash. A lot of flavour packed into a something so simple. They have a great selection of classic breakfast items, as well as classics with a twist!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is ok but i don't like the deep fried duck fat potato chunks.  How about some shoe string hash brown?"}
{"text":"Got chicken and waffles, there was only a smear of syrup on the plate.
Asked for more syrup. Well when the bill came the syrup was 50 cents.  I can understand if I ordered a dish that isn't typically served with syrup, but in this case it's a bit ridiculous. I wasn't informed of the additional charge either. 

The first time I was there, I found HAIR in my plate and they took it away and charged me full price. No replacement was offered, I was only half way through the plate. Thought I'd give it another chance and the above happened.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food here was okay but the music was way too loud. We had to yell at each other just to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews about this place so I decided to try it out on a weekday to avoid the inevitable weekend brunch rush. The food was good (I got the upstream Benny and my friend got the veggie Benny). We especially liked the unique hollandaise sauce and the overall seasoning of the dishes. Portion sizes were good for the price as well.
I had the lavender latte and the bar forgot to make it, but once I got it I was disappointed with the flavour- good but nothing special.
The service was okay; the server and hostess were both incredibly enthusiastic but I felt rushed to order and later to pay and leave. I would prefer a more relaxed experience, especially since it was a weekday and there wasn't a wait for our table. 
Overall, I liked the food and look of this restaurant! If I come back, I'll skip the coffee and be prepared for a quick eat."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot we've been to so far!! Food comes to the table fast. We love that it's an open kitchen so you can see how in sync the staff is together. Very causal atmosphere and the food was amazing. Extremely friendly staff, I got the feel that everyone was our waitstaff lol everyone jumps in to help one another."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 1:30pm on a Saturday with hubby to try out this place that has received solid reviews in the NW. We were seated within 5min although this is highly unusual during peak hours of 9am-1pm. 

Our server bought us hot coffee as requested and different people topped up our cups throughout the meal which was fantastic!  Our server was helpful and friendly as we informed her it was our first time.

Due to my lactose issue, she checked on the chicken gravy that came with the chicken poutine, hold the cheese, in my case. Kitchen suggested I have their home made hollandaise instead as the gravy is made with cream. My twice fried taters in duck fat, big chunks of white chicken and light sauce was a generous portion. It was deelish!  

Hubby had the farmers breakfast with 3 sunny side up eggs,toast, hash, homemade sausage patties and bacon. Bacon was sweet almost like candy so if you like sugar, it's great. We found it too sweet. I liked the sausage patty but my hubby did not. It was reminiscent of Asian street meat to me for some reason?!? 

Overall, this was a good solid breakfast place that has excellent service and a relaxed and sunny ambience. I would like to go again to try other items such as the apple pie waffle and one of the bennys."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal. The bacon was made in-house and the flavour was rich and smokey, everything you want from a craft made bacon. 

The eggs were properly made to order, exactly as I asked for them.

The orange juice was clearly freshly squeezed, and not under-sized.

The hash browns had a very rich flavor, thanks to being tossed in duck fat. Not healthy I'm sure but oh so good.

While I'm not a fan of waffles, I wanted to try the chicken from the Chicken and Waffles dish. They were happy to accomodate (the service was great and the manager was very attentive) and hands down it's some of the best fried chicken I've had. The Sous Vide process means it's perfectly cooked and very tender inside, while the outside is a perfect golden brown.

Overall it's not the cheapest breakfast, but you get great value for the price."}
{"text":"Bro'kin Yolk Cafe, what a great new brunch spot to open in the NW. We need more local restaurants in this area!

Came on a Saturday around 1pm, it was about a 30 minute wait. Seating was a bit cramped for a handicapped man on crutches (yea, thats me), however the staff ensured that I was comfortable. The owner came around to chat as he suffered the same injury as me in the past (damn this ACL tear, it gets the best of everyone).

We ordered 4 mini waffles to start, and the chicken and waffles for the main. The white chocolate lavender sauce was delish. Chicken was nice and crispy, perfect compliment to my waffle. Pricing was definitely comparable to any other brunch spot around the city.

A great place for a family or a romantic brunch for two."}
{"text":"Review: brunch.

We were helping a friend move and were famished. We needed to fuel up and found just the right place.

Bottomline: fantastic brunch food. Can get busy so make sure you go early.

Atmosphere: the restaurant was opened not too long ago so you can imagine how clean and modern it is inside. Place was packed but we didn't have to wait to get seated at 1pm. Service was good.

Food: We had the house cured bacon poutine and the Spanish chorizo bowl. The house cured bacon worked well with the two poached eggs and fries. The fries were done with duck fat so that added an extra complexity to the dish. Everything was tasty and well cooked. However, if it wasn't for a morning of heavy lifting, I would think the dish was fairly heavy and a bit over-seasoned. The Spanish chorizo bowl had a great Spanish flare and was also very tasty. Unfortunately, it was also fairly heavy and over-seasoned.

Value: great food at a good price. Portions were just right. Although it would be nice to add a few more lighter sides (i.e. fruits) to balance the dishes out."}
{"text":"Went in on a busy weekend. 

We wanted to book for 12 pm. We were told we would get a text whenever our table was ready so we pretty much had to be on stand-by. Once we received the text we have 15 minutes to arrive. This worked because we lived in close proximity but if you live in the south you better pull some fast n furious sh**, once you get that message on your mobile device. 

We walked in and we were told to wait for about 10 minutes which was okay, even though we were starving.

The atmosphere was cool, they had graffiti type art on the walls and the waitress was friendly and attentive. 

There were some pieces of cake on the counter to eat while you wait but last time I checked we weren't peasants in the french revolution, waiting for the queen of France to utter the famous words, \"let them eat cake.\" 

Once we were seated we all ordered a hot beverage. I got a chai latte which was about $5. I ordered an \"appetizer\" waffle that could literally be consumed in one bite...by a new born baby (about the size of a halloween-sized snickers bar) Basically it was tiny AF.

 Next came the salmon sandwich with an egg and some vegetables. It was decent but a bit basic considering its about $15. 

I think because of the rush that morning, the quality was basically cut in half. The french toast was also very basic. 

Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ever walk into a place and you feel like you're not cool enough to be there? Yeah, this is Bro'kin Yolk, full of bros with long unkempt beards and flannel shirts and thinner-than-thou suburban gals in trendy second-hand frocs. We happened to be in this area on a Sunday morning so pulled up Yelp and this was the highest rated place in the neighborhood. Called the number on their website and discovered they had a 1 hour, 15 minute wait. We had shopping to do anyway so we put our name on the list. I was quite surprised when we got a call after just 40 minutes so we rushed out of a store and straight here, where our table was just ready. The menu is extensive. Contrary to the Yelp notes, this place DOES serve alcohol including mimosas, Caesars and beer.  We settled for the Eggs benny served on waffles (so-so. The waffles make it too sweet, and not enough hollandaise sauce). The homemade sausage was good, but portions too small. The drinks were nice and strong. Our waitress was friendly but would often disappear for extended periods but others would step in.  For all the raving about this place, I was expecting so much more. 

Be careful what you wish for. Here comes the real Bro'kin Yolk: About 45 minutes after leaving the cafe, I started feeling some rumblings and gurglings down under. Uh oh. Pulled over in a strip mall and RAN to the Canadian Superstore washroom where I barely made it before I almost pulled an Al Roker (I apologize to the Canadian Superstore janitor). I figured I was catching a bug but I felt fine otherwise. My wife spent a lot of time making fun of me, until about an hour later, BOOM, she had the same experience but luckily we were now home. I can't prove we got sick from the food, but it was too much of a coincidence as we had not eaten anything since dinner the night before, and we both shared the same plate at brunch.  Either way, I won't take the chance of eating there again. And most importantly, the food wasn't all that."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place out, after driving by numerous times. It was worth the wait! I had the chicken and waffles, hubby had the eggs and sausage. Both were excellent. The waitstaff were very efficient and friendly. Plan to revisit in the near future"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago and had the eggs Benedict.... Pretty good but thought the hollandaise sauce could've been a little thicker but otherwise very flavourful. Not sure why they cook everything in duck fat as I didn't notice much of a difference in flavour. The eggs Benny are on a waffle instead of an English muffin which was different but taste good and less heavy.  the crispy potatoes were very good. The place is very small and a little crowded with the tables close together but otherwise not a bad place for breakfast and happy to see more of these places coming up in the Northwest"}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast place I've been to. The open faced avocado sandwich is my go to. Also the hash browns are a must ! So delicious and always great service. Music can be too loud sometimes but that's ok."}
{"text":"Amazing, staff was very knowledgeable about everything in the menu, food and service was great. I will defiantly be back again ."}
{"text":"First one trying it ! Very different menu but very good. Healthy and fun options that you can't get everywhere. Service was great all around. Definetly recommend if you like trendy little gems !"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast with the family. Definitely have to try the chicken and waffles next!"}
{"text":"So happy Bro'kin Yolk is here! We were so bored of the chain fast food breakfast in our hood. Now we have a boutique style amazing one of a kind breakfast joint. We have reached 'regular' status we think!! The food is 10/10, the only thing better than the food is the service. Everything from chicken and waffles to several different types of amazing eggs benny! Here's a tip, if you don't get the fried chicken and waffles, ask for the hot sauce on the side that comes with that dish. Also get the mini Belgian waffles for an appy with salted caramel dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"The Bro'kin Yolk was something that I've wanted to try for the longest time.  I've heard a lot of hype and boy did it sure deliver!  The restaurant is an open style concept paying homage to the great diners of before.  At the same time it manages to be decorated in a more contemporary style that sets it apart from the usual breakfast diner.

We were seated and promptly greeted by our friendly server.  I drink my coffee black and I can attest that it was a good brew.  The coffee was strong enough to wake me up but had enough flavours in there to make me have a second.  One issue I had was that I was charged a refill without letting me know it would be an extra charge.  It was a minor oversight though, nothing big.

I ordered the short rib hash and I was quite pleased with the presentation.  The egg was cooked sunny side up and it was quite possibly the best sunny side up egg I've seen.  The yolk had a nice orange hue and flowed beautifully, like a calm waterfall on a nice spring day, over my hash browns.  The hash browns were fried to a nice golden brown, crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside.  The short rib meat was quite flavorful. All the ingredients blended together with each bite.

One of our brunch companions wasn't too happy with her order, she ordered the vegan hash and didn't have enough tofu in her dish.  She mentioned this to the ownership and they said they would look into it.  It's great to hear a business that values feedback and takes it constructively.

I have business to attend to in the area about once a month so I will try to make it a monthly visit."}
{"text":"A brand new addition to the Calgary breakfast and brunch game! The interior is beautifully decorated using a modern and open kitchen design. 

The restaurant's signature dishes involve anything with duck hash which is served with most dishes on the menu. The eggs used are all organic and free range. We ordered the braised rib breakfast poutine and the sausage frittata. Both dishes were heavenly and full of flavour. However, the frittata was a little saltier then expected but otherwise cooked perfectly. 

The service was a little slow but they are still working out the kinks especially with the ordering on the iPads. Otherwise the food was delicious and I will definitely be back. Great new addition to the NW breakfast scene"}
{"text":"A few of us decided to go for brunch outside of our usual inner city spots and we came across the Bro'kin Yolk after having heard good things about the restaurant. It was a busy place, and it was nice that you could hold your place in line after talking to the host and they would send you a text when your table is ready. The ambiance was upbeat and contemporary, however the booth seats we had were not very deep and even for someone with short legs, it was a very stiff seating experience. 

Food wise, I ordered the chicken and waffles as it's the first words I saw on the wall when I walked in the door. I was definitely let down by my order. The waffle was quite thin leading it to be overall soft instead of being crisp on by outside and soft and light on the inside. The fried chicken tasted good but it wasn't distinct or memorable. The biggest disappointment came in the chicken gravy. It was not smooth, liquidy, or hot but had more of the consistency of refrigerated KFC gravy in its chunky semi-solid state. I don't know if I will return but I probably won't try the chicken and waffles. If this is the dish you want, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our family recently visited Brokin Yolk for breakfast. We heard great things about the restaurant and also heard that line ups are a normal occurrence. So we decided to call in advance before heading down.

We were seated right away, and our orders came in quickly. For a super busy restaurant, they get all the orders out quickly without any problems. 

The atmosphere of the atmosphere was great and their servers were very attentive. 

We ordered 2 waffles and chicken, pulled pork hash, salmon benny, Nutella french toast, usual farm breakfast (eggs, bacon, toast, rtc), and tocino with rice.  All were amazing! The only minor complaint was that the chicken still had the bones in it, so it was a bit hard to just cut on top of the waffles.

Overall, I definitely recommend Brokin Yolk, but make sure to call in advance so you are not waiting in line for hours before getting seated."}
{"text":"Go all the time , never been disappointed, friendly staff , awesome food. However i would highly recommend wait listing on weekends , as wait times can sometimes push well over a hour."}
{"text":"It is nice to see an independent restaurant open in the Northwest, but there is nothing special about this place that will have me running back. If you are looking for an average restaurant to have eggs and toast then this is your place. I get the impression they would like to be OEB, but with the overly casual service and the unoriginal menu they will have to step it up to obtain that level of perfection. I will keep my fingers crossed, but since they usually have a waiting list to get in, due to lack of options in the area, I doubt they have any real impetus to do so."}
{"text":"Service is quick.  Excellent system where you call to put your name down for a wait list as they don't do reservations.  They'll text you once the table is almost ready.  The portion is decent for the price.  Not many vegetarian options.  But food is very flavourful."}
{"text":"Was in the area so wanted to try somewhere new- first off, I would rate this place 5 stars alone for service and efficiency... top notch. However I wasnt impressed with the food at all unfortunately. Got the Oscar Benny although not terrible, it wasnt anything special or flavorful. The hashbrowns have this salty/sugar mix that theyre tossed in, not a fan of that sugar aspect with an expected savory dish as well as there was a sweet aspect to the benny, maybe the waffle it comes served on? The hollandaise is really skimpy that you cant really get the full flavor of it and isnt enough to go with the waffle etc. Overall although I love the service and effort that this place puts in, I just wouldnt make the trip up there for the food alone."}
{"text":"This place is really out of the way for me and far north, but definitely worth stopping by if you are ever in the area!! No resos allowed, but they do have a waiting in line system where you would call ahead and give your name and number and they would text you when your table is ready. Perfect if you need to get a couple of errands done before hand. I highly suggest you call 1.5hr in advance when you actually wanna come if you're coming in on a weekend, the place is pretty popular. My friend and I came in on a holiday so it was BUSY. We had to wait a little longer for a table once we got in, but the seating staff were super friendly and apologized for the business. The place itself is small, but super charming, emphasizing on the whole 'farm to table' vibe. There's also an open concept kitchen which I like. 

We eventually got seated and decided on drinks and got mini waffles to start. I got a green smoothie (omit honey) and while it was a little watered down, it was good. My girlfriend got a lavender latte and I really liked it, pretty floral tasting. Our mini waffles came and we each got different sauces to try. I got nutella and she got white chocolate lavender. The waffles themselves were a little on the firmer side, but still pretty tasty. I really enjoyed my nutella and you can definitely taste the white chocolate and lavender in the other, it also tasted much sweeter. 

For mains, I was stuck between the short rib hash and the chicken and waffles. The server said that they were both super popular, but suggested I go with the waffles. Damn, was she ever right! Holy hell were those some AMAZING chicken and waffles!! It came with this amazing sweet and spicy syrup as well as white chicken gravy. Delicious delicious delicious!! As much as I want to try the short rib hash next time, I think I'm stuck with this god sent meal. My girlfriend got the breakfast poutine with bacon and damn those were some amazing duck fat hash browns! Seriously anything in duck fat is incredible. 

So happy I finally got to try this place out, it really held up to my expectations. Service, atmosphere and overall quality were top notch and I found the prices to also be pretty reasonable. Will definitely come back when I can."}
{"text":"I came here to see what all the hype was about and was a bit disappointed. I actually could not stand their potatoes because I don't believe sugar belongs on potatoes!!! The sweet pork Benny was the most recommended which was another disappointment because why is pork sweet in the first place?! I must be a savoury type of a girl but I give them a 2 star because I really loved their baby kale salad. The rest was MEH not sure what people were raving about I must have missed something. I much rather prefer Cora's or OEB"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday morning around 10:30 am and it was easy to get a spot for 2 (I had called ahead to ask about wait time too.) My husband had the Upstream Benny and really enjoyed it. I had the French toast fondue -it was really good and enjoyed the Nutella chocolate dip. I was a bit disappointed with the fruit - it wasn't fresh (ie Cora Fresh). Overall service was friendly and good. I have a condition where I have an issue with noise  so would bring some earplugs for myself since it would hurt my ears if place was really busy. Would love to come again! They also have a MealShare program but we didn't notice it until after we had ordered."}
{"text":"Got to finally try The Bro'kin Yolk.  After a wait of about 10 mins, we were promptly seated at our table.  BTW, they have a fancy wait system.  You call the restaurant and get a text when your table is ready.  It works!  

We ordered:
- MINI HOMEMADE BELGIAN WAFFLES with WHITE CHOCOLATE LAVENDER & SALTED CARAMEL - these are tasty!  Also, had the Homemade Sausage with the waffles.
- ROASTED TOMATO & BASIL BISQUE SOUP - Very, very good!
- OPEN FACE AVOCADO SANDWICH - AVOCADO, TOMATO, SUNNY-SIDE UP EGG, BALSAMIC REDUCTION ON 9 GRAIN TOAST TOPPED WITH BASIL ARUGULA PURÉE - with a side order of BABY KALE CAESAR SALAD - Excellent!  The sandwich was so good!  The Baby Kale Caesar Salad came with baby kale, pieces of chunky bacon, pieces of waffle, cheddar cheese and a nice Caesar dressing.

We also had their coffee.  I just wish their coffee cup is a bit bigger. 

Wait staff was polite and other staff kept coming to check on us.  Coffee was filled quickly (seeing that's a smaller cup).  

Yes, we would come back again!  Will post pictures later."}
{"text":"Have heard a lot of buzz about this place. My friends and I showed up quarter to 1 and it was about a 45 minute wait. We busied ourselves by checking out Reno Depot (not a whole lot of anything else in the area lol). Once seated, I ordered the Short Rib Hash with over easy eggs. Potatoes were nice and crispy, beef was tender and well seasoned and eggs were perfectly cooked. The price was $15.50, pretty comparable pricing to other brunch places. Once our order was taken, food came out fairly quickly. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself is quaint and nicely decorated. Restaurant seemed to thin out around 1:30, so if you're looking to beat the breakfast/brunch rush on a weekend, coming later in the afternoon will get you a table right away. Also, if you purchase their water vs ordering tap water, $1 of the purchase goes to charity."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 I had the Belgian waffles with scrambled eggs and sausage and it was delicious .

Service 5/5 I was with my little guy and the place was so busy, the gentleman at the front was so nice and asked if I didn't mind the communal table we could be seated right away with a high chair! Just the great service at the door already made the visit phenomenal. Our server was also great. 

Parking 5/5 there is ample places to park in the Parking lot.

Environment 5/5 place is very clean and kept up. It is very busy so noise is a bit high but you would expect that at a busy establishment.


Great place to come for great food and services ! I highly recommend this place to anyone especially if you are in the NW."}
{"text":"As far as breakfast places go, this one is really good.  Menu is small but offers up a decent variety of breakfast goodness at a reasonable price.  And the coffee keeps coming so that's always a plus. The chicken and waffles caught my eye, but felt that maybe this might be too heavy for breakfast.

The place was packed so we sat at the community table, I don't mind this concept at all, but others might not like the idea of sitting with strangers, we were seated by some new mommies and it was nice to chat up with them while waiting for our breakie.

Our waitress was quite nice however her eyebrows were so distracting, I mean how could friends and family let someone walk out of the house like that is beyond me, I don't want to be rude but she is such a pretty girl that if I knew her I would be all, no...other than that she was efficient and did a good job.

I ordered the salmon eggs benny and my friend ordered this little skillet of eggs that was similar to an omelette in a mini cast iron pan, it looked delish, next time I will try that one.  Both came with nice golden chunks of hash brown potatoes and a carb, mine was a half waffle and my friend had multi-grain toast.  They do offer GF options too so that was nice to see.

Loved that they give you ketchup in the mini bottles, so cute and liked the unlimited strong coffee, it hit the spot for a late breakfast and I made it to dinner without feeling hungry.

Will be back, so much better than Cora's without the complacent wait staff.  Owner was there too, I like to see that, means he actually gives a crap about how his business is run. Kudos"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Love going there during the week. So great to have an independent restaurant in the area, and not have to resort to the same old chains all the time. The Little Farmer is great for a smaller breakfast, but I usually have the eggs benedict. Great coffee, excellent service, and the owner always thanks us when we're leaving."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this breakfast diner, lunch is good here as well. It's a bit out of the way for me but price fresh ingredients and preparation make this place worth the trip. Highly recommend this place"}
