{"text":"Tastes like Pizza Hut. Most expensive pizza around. Tough to keep the bill under $50 if you are planning to feed 4 people."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, subs, wings, salads, stromboli, and pepperoni rolls.  Veggie lovers will love the veggie pizza. A white sauce with cauliflower and broccoli. The ultimate pizza is delicious as is the ultimate stromboli.  Wings are a bit spicy,  but big quality wings.  It's a bit pricey for a pizza place. Keep an eye out for coupons and ask about daily specials. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My hometown has the original Joes, so I was thrilled to find this one in the Pittsburgh vicinity, even if a little far out there. Best square pizza ever. The veggie pizza is so much more than pizza. I can't explain it. You just have to try it."}
{"text":"Well , I just LOVE Pizza Joe's . . Used to be in Moon at the West Hills shopping center , but that was torn down a while back . Pizza Joe's still exists, just not at that location . But you've just gotta try out their different styles of pizza available  ."}
{"text":"I am originally from just north of NYC.  This is very close to that flavor. Good sauce. Great dough. Quick delivery."}
