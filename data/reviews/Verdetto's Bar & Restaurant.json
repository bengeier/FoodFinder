{"text":"Great little bar close to my home.  It's definitely a place for regulars, but they welcome the occasional outsider as well.  The inside has been redone, so it looks very nice - but it still has a dive bar feel.  And in case you have any doubts, the prices are cheap and you'll see 40s to go in the cooler as you walk in.   The dining area is not that big, so if it's busy you might have to eat in the bar area.  Which is no big deal, the whole place is not that huge.  The kitchen is only open til about 8pm, though, and isn't open at all on weekends (hence the loss of one star).  I know, this seems crazy.  But if you are able to go during the week, definitely stop by and grab some grub.  The same guy is always working the kitchen, both taking orders and making the food.  He's terribly nice and always makes our visit a pleasant one.    The menu is pretty basic and reasonably priced.  Daily specials are usually something interesting if you're feeling adventurous.  Otherwise, try the Iron City Beer Battered Fish Sandwich.  Now, I'm not at all a fish sandwich connoisseur, but I've had my fair share.  And this fish sandwich at Verdetto's is quite possibly the best fish sandwich I've ever had in Pittsburgh (at a place that doesn't already claim to have the best fish sandwich in town).  The fish has the most perfect crunch on the outside and the softest flakiness on the inside.  I don't know how it's done.  If you're not feeling fish, the Patty House Burger is fantastic (you can get it plain or add toppings).   I recently ordered the burger with bacon and cheese and could barely find the (half pound) burger under the generous portions of toppings.  Sandwiches come with slaw or fries - the slaw is good, but the fries are seasoned.  There are other sandwiches available, pizza and they have some pasta dishes on the menu, too, as well as salads.  As impressed as I always am with the food and the service (all from one amazing man), I guess it only makes sense that the cook/waiter/host gets those weekends off."}
{"text":"You know that green and yellow bar on the right side of the parkway north as you leave the city, this is it. I've passed this place about 500 times and always wanted to stop in. Well last Saturday I finally did, and man-o-man was I pleased. I expected a dingy divey old bar, and this was the opposite. It's clean with a beautiful original wood bar, tin ceilings, and all sorts of brass nicknacks all over the place. The clientele is a bunch of middle aged Northsiders that like to pump the juke box full of classic rock, talk Stillers and 'guins, drink their drinks fast, and do a lot of laughing.The beers are cold, tall, and dirt cheap. A mason jar full of Yuengling is $2.10 or a 24 oz glass is $3.  As outsiders I expected my friend and I to get a \"You're not welcome here\" look, but the bar tender and other patrons were very friendly and quick to include us in conversation if we wanted to join. Looks like Verdettos just joined my list of go to joints for a good cold beer.   Oh, and apparently they are famous for their Turtle Soup, so there's that too."}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time, and finally decided to stop in.  The bartender was friendly and easy to talk to.  I recently moved from the D.C. area, so to me the drink prices were really cheap.  There small draft selection is always $3 for a 22 or 24 ounce glass.  They had more of a selection in bottles.   I had a fried chicken \"hellfire\" sandwich with fries, and it was really good.   The \"hellfire\" sauce had just the right amount of heat.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a decent bar that offers huge 22oz (if I had to guess) glasses of beer for $3.  We stopped here quickly on the bar crawl.  You really get a home town, family atmosphere in this place.  The service was great, even when it got pretty busy."}
{"text":"No food just pizza made in the the morning by the owner although the Clemente mural is awesome"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in the North Side! Such awesome bartenders and such a diverse crowd!!! I always have a blast here!"}
