{"text":"My dad did the reservation for 8 people about a week ago. When we arrived, the hostess told us it will take 10 minutes to get our table; we waited about 25 minutes. Finally we got to our table; the waitress (who looked like a lost puppy)showed up 15 minutes later to take our drinks order, meantime no water glasses have been served. Another 15-20 minutes later, drinks have arrived.   We place our orders for for dishes, plus we asked for water, since it wasn't coming automatically. I believe we waited for our main dish about 40 minutes, so  I loosing patience, therefore I decided that my father should open his gifts now.   Most my family were satisfied with their food. I had the salmon tartare, all the ingredients were good except it was soaked with too much of mayonnaise. Since it's my dad's birthday, we asked for desert, immediately my mom was regretting the desert because she knew it will be really long before it would show up and yes it did come 20 minutes later.   I know the restaurant was super busy. When the restaurant offers special on Sundays, I believe staffing should be increased.   Due to lack of good service; we couldn't enjoy the family dinner. Massively disappointing."}
{"text":"Service du gérant irrespectueux, mauvaise gestion de sa part dans le placement et les réservation, insolent quand tu lui pose une question, bref bien que la bouffe est bonne par son service il fait que le client n'est pas roi. Donc non je n'y retournerai plus et non je leurs ferais plus de pub!"}
