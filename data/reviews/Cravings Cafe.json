{"text":"So far so good! Friendly staff, good coffee, well lit, which isn't my preference, but may be for others, and good ambiance.   Local artist work is displayed, which is cool. There's also free wifi! That's expected...   Don't be mistaken, though, this is a coffee house, not a cafe!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was calm and nice. After lunch we had coffee and a snack both, again, were fantastic! great place to go!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cravings for coffee, but it wasn't so special that I'd keep going there for the coffee.  Now that they've added Thai cuisine, I'll most definitely be returning.  At first, when I saw the sign featuring Thai food, I was skeptical.  As I was walking by one day, on a walk to another nearby local restaurant, I stopped in for a menu and a look around.  The inside was cozy and very inviting and the menu options sounded delicious.  I decided to stay for dinner, but preferred to eat on the patio since it was a beautiful evening.  The patio needs a complete clean up.  Clean the weeds between the pavers and remove the cigarette butts off of the ground!!!  That's just gross!  Add some nice tablecloths and it'll be more enjoyable.  The food is absolutely fabulous though!   I'd recommend carry out or eating inside the nice cozy quarters.  Glad to see this addition to the area."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Cleveland. Inventive dishes and the ingredients are very fresh. Cute decor. A little on the expensive side, but portions are big."}
{"text":"Went to Cravings this morning and it was just ok. The cappuccino was tepid at best and you could taste more milk than coffee.  Sat outside because it was beautiful weather but the patio did not have much  personality, no flowers or anything pleasing to the eye, but it did have tons of weeds.. Prefer Erie Island Coffee Company"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland. Love the Pad Thai with tofu. Panag curry is great too. The people who work there are so polite."}
{"text":"Without question, the best Thai in the Cleveland area. If you want Thai hot, you can get it- along with fresh ingredients and masterful preparation. Our party of five was totally impressed across the board. You really cannot go wrong! Go there!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with my wife and kids. It's hard to say what I liked more about this place, the food or the service. The food was outstanding and the service matched. We had the Pad Ee Mao and the ginger pad King. Also the chicken wings and tom gum soup. All were excellent. The kids shared the fried rice which was also really good. Our waitress, whose name escapes me, was so kind to us and the kids. A great place for parents to get an excellent meal and feel good about having their kids with them."}
{"text":"My friend gets tea at the drive through menu and I was drawn in by the amazing scent of authentic smelling Thai food.   I loved the Pad Kee Mao. I got a 3-4 spicy and it was pretty hot. I don't usually like vegetables but I looooved them in this dish because of all the flavors.   Good spring rolls, my sister liked the summer rolls too.   My boyfriend got the Thai Style Fried Rice. It was really good and spicy. We both loved it!   It's a really small place, but decorated very cute--the walls and curtains are purple and it truly gives off that traditional Thai vibe.   Can't wait to go back again! Amazing place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is fresh, clean, and delicious. The wonton soup is one of the best in town - especially with the pork dumplings. The chicken satay is also remarkably flavorful. I've tried the curries, and every single one is excellent. My favorite dish to date is the pad see ew. The noodles and chicken are savory and nutty while the veggies add a nice texture and crunch. All in all a great time with great food."}
{"text":"Coffee is great. Atmosphere is very nice and the food looks great. I'm hanging out until lunch is served"}
{"text":"Authentic thai food, good coffee and tea. The place used to be strictly coffee and tea, but a couple months ago they brought on a chef. I used to get coffee from here all the time because it was on my way to work.   As far as the food goes it was pretty good. We got pad thai and pad see ew which was very fresh and delicious. We also split a shrimp wanton soup, and it was quite tasty as well.   I love what they did with the atmosphere and the interior. It looks very cozy and inviting! We will definitely be coming back for both coffee and food!"}
{"text":"You might call Cravings the bipolar Southeast Asian coffee house.  By day, for breakfast and lunch, it's a reasonably good coffee house -- flavored grinds, a variety of syrups for regular coffees, some pastries, wraps, sandwiches, and the like.  All that changes Monday thru Saturday, from 5:00pm to 10:00pm, when it becomes \"Cravings Coffee & Tea Thai Cuisine.\"  Their \"new cook Tibby from Thailand\" prepares a variety of appetizers, soups, salads, and entrees, including curries and noodle dishes such as Pad Thai.  Serving sizes range between large and monstrous.  Most importantly, they are willing to work with you.  My wife wanted an essentially vegetarian stir fry, but she wanted some chicken thrown in and cashews added.  Not a problem -- and we were assured it would not be spicy if she didn't want it so.   In fact, if anything, it was somewhat bland, needing the help of some soy sauce.  But the excellent wait staff was quick about making the needed improvement.  My Pad Thai was an unusual experience.  Having experienced that dish at 8 or so local restaurants, I had a pretty good idea what to expect -- stir-fried rice noodles mixed with egg, green onion, bean sprouts, carrots, and shrimp AND chicken in a tamarind sauce, topped with ground peanuts and with lime wedges on the side.  This was a bit different.  I ordered the shrimp, and my dish arrived with about eight of them, compared with the norm of three at most places.  You had your choices of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or tofu, each priced separately.  I asked for a little heat in the spiciness category, and it arrived just as requested.  I tried a soup, the Tom Yum Goong, a hot and spicy soup with three shrimp, lime juice, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, mushroom and tomato.  Delicious!  Next time, I'll give the Tom Kha Gai a try, with its promises of coconut milk and chicken.  On the plus side are a comfortable ambience, ample free parking, extreme cleanliness, courteous staff, and a pretty good take on Thai cuisine.  However, two negatives remain.  Prices are on the high side.  Salads are $8.95 to $13.95, while entrees, curries and noodle dishes are in the $10.95-$14.95 range.  That seems about 15-20% higher than many other Thai spots.  And for all Tibby's prowess in the kitchen, there were NO desserts offered, either on the menu or by the waitress.  That's a shame, since standbys like coconut ice cream would find a ready market here."}
{"text":"While I am still a fan of Cravings, I did have a recent experience there that was less than satisfactory....in the \"Ambiance\" department. It has always been such a great dining experience but when my husband and I were there this past Friday for a late dinner the radio was on and it was mostly static.I don't recall the music I normally hear while dining there but I would definitely remember if it was A) a radio station (commercials) and B) Static-y! So I mentioned it to the two young girls who were working. We were the only ones there and the girls were both behind the bar so that is where we sat. I didn't recognize the girls...and I can't recall the names of the staff who I normally see (and have always thoroughly enjoyed). So they tried to fix the station, apparently had no way to play Pandora and it didn't improve. The other thing that prompted me to write this review is the way the girls were behaving: giddy, silly, super chatty w/ each other as though my husband and I weren't there. I don't require attention but I really wanted to somehow let these girls know they should tone it down. I realize we were the only ones they were due to close in a half hour. As usual, Chef Tibby's food was outstanding (shrimp skewer appetizer, tofu appetizer & coconut curry w/ calamari level 3- super yum) I hope next time it is as serene as it usually is!!"}
{"text":"The Thai coffee bubble tea is worth it! The green curry is my favorite, but know that when they say spicy, they mean it. If you're uncertain about how spicy you'd like your meal, probably go a bit more conservative than you usually would."}
{"text":"Once again, fellow Yelpers, you didn't let me down on this recommendation.  The boyfriend and I love a good cup of independent joe.  We usually creep around Tremont but found Cravings after having breakfast at Borderline Cafe.  The outside of the building makes you wonder if you are about to step into a knick knack shop with a bunch of Sweet Memories dolls staring you in the face...nah, not quite.  The walls are painted an uplifting red, and nice artwork adorns those walls.  Paul (not sure if he's the owner or the manager) warmly greeted us and told us they were voted best Independent coffee shop for the last 4 years in a row.  Truth be told, my latte was solid and the boyfriend's Tiramisu flavor of the day was delicious.  Deep, robust flavors and smooth as hell.  And we picked up some of their Caribbean Nights and Rainforest Crunch coffee beans.  Great discovery."}
{"text":"This is a tough review because I am torn between two opposite sides - the quality of the food vs the exorbitant pricing.  I am usually one where pricing wins out.  In this odd case, I guess I will side with the food.  Ordered the following - Thai Money bags $11 (8 pieces), Jungle Curry with squid $17, Green Curry with chicken $16 and Pad Thai with chicken $16.  This added up to pennies shy of $60.  Priced the same items from a competitor in Rocky River and while they didn't have the Thai Money Bag appetizer I substituted pot stickers and their bill would have added up to $46.  So was this place $15 better or what?  Aggh, that is so tough to decide.  To be honest, you would have to do the comparison.  In other words, your mileage will vary and you would come up with your own opinion.  Here is what I could tell you.  The Thai Money bags were basically 8 filled (pork filling) and fried won tons.  Total size of each was about a quarter-sized bag.  Taste was very good. Came with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Was it worth $11.  Oh no ... In fact, hell no!  They were good though. I'd say they should be priced similar to the competitors appetizes $6.  Note:  Most of Cravings appetizers were right around $10.  A bowl of Tom Yum soup is $10, a cup $6.  Entrees - Wife had the Green Chicken curry and thought it was outstanding.  I tasted it and agreed.  I had the jungle curry and asked for it extra hot - 10.  Thankfully someplace made their dish hot.  Spice level was a 10.  Two comments - My jungle curry was watery and I was expecting something a bit like sauce, not soup.  My wife's green curry had a nice thick coconut like texture to it.  Secondly, there was very few squid in the jungle curry.  In fact, very few vegetables either.  But it did have an extraordinary amount of spicy hot liquid in there.  I thought the pad thai (chicken) was very good. Entrees were the typical plastic or Styrofoam container size.  Overall, seeing a $15 difference, I have to ask myself - \"Self, how often will you return to Cravings vs the competitor?\"  It's amazing to me that if this was priced similarly I would probably return every other month.  With this priced so high, probably once or twice a year.  It's too bad Cravings ownership doesn't see that.  It's almost like they took this location next to the fancy Beachcliff area (the location is an old coffee shop and they do showcase coffee/teas/pasteries esp. during the morning) and figured everyone has money there so we could charge $3-$4 more for every dish.  Nobody will notice it nor care.  Good food, but very pricy!"}
{"text":"First experience was alright. No one greeted me when I first came in or inducted me to take a seat or help me order. I finally inquired about food and  they said don't serve food until 4pm yet had a lunch menu and close at 6 per online. They did allow me to eat but not before reminding me that I would be the only one eating (clearly not an issue for me). The bubble teas was very Icey and came out after my food. The food( pad woon sen) was alright, not the best I've had."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times for boba. We decided we wanted to come back for dinner. I am not fond of going out of my (culinary) comfort zone, but my fiancé loves Thai food! I ordered chicken pad Thai with no spice, and my fiancé ordered pad kee maw very spicy! We both enjoyed our food and I had enough to take home for leftovers. The atmosphere was bustling on a Saturday night, yet service was still prompt!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Thai food that is fresh and piquant. I had the tom yum gum soup and it was excellent--nice and spicy, featuring shrimp, mushrooms and cilantro. Also worth every bite was the superior summer rolls--shrimp, rice noodles, carrots and another thing wrapped in rice paper rolls. Yum. I'm happy."}
{"text":"We literally live down the street, and drive by here at least once daily. Finally tried it tonight, as we were in the mood to go out, and could not agree on anything. This was lucky!  The place is tiny, and eclectic. I love purple, so the walls made me happy. It seems to be part coffee/tea house, and part restaurant.  Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. She offered suggestions, and answered questions. I asked a lot of questions. The menu is large, and has good descriptions. I've been to other Thai places that were yummy, but this seemed a bit more authentic.   I had a lovely iced tea, which was a nice blend of green and black teas. Refreshing and wonderful. I need to do that at home when I make tea.   I purposely tried things I've never heard of and I was pleased with both choices. I started with a cup (big cup!) of soup. It was Tom Kha Gai, which is a coconut milk soup with chicken (or shrimp), lemongrass, baby corn, mushrooms, and carrots. I cannot fully explain all the flavors happening in that cup of soup. It was creamy, but not heavy. Each spoonful popped with different flavor, and they all complemented each other perfectly. I want that soup again, soon.   My main course was from the specials menu, and had shrimp, carrots, cilantro, some other yummy veggies with ginger and black pepper over mung bean noodles. I'd never heard of a mung bean noodle. Served with a nice lime wedge, which gave the perfect zing. It was also surprising. The ginger was so fresh and perfect, and the mung bean noodles were springy and light. After the soup, I was unable to finish (or barely dent) my meal. I'll enjoy it steamed for breakfast, for sure.  I'm so sorry we never stopped in before. I cannot wait to try more of the menu.   We had a few folks at our table to check on us during the meal. Everyone was wonderful and friendly."}
{"text":"Very cute place. I appriciated the color purple, fresh flowers, and overall atmosohere.   I ordered the massaman curry with tofu. The broth was very good, but my only two complaints were 1. Very minimal ingredients. This particular dish had tofu, peanuts, potato and onion. And other than peanuts, there wasn't much substance in this dish. Lots of sauce left over, which I will add to my own veggies. 2. The price ($12.00+) for a mere vegetable and rice dish, lacking in the ingredients mentioned above, was simply too much."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always try to eat here when I am home. One thing to point out is to be careful about the spice levels. This is coming from someone who eats spicy foods daily. They don't joke about spiciness here :-) definitely try out their Pad Thai, spring rolls, and Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Thai menu is extensive. Has a very wide selection of dishes with all your Thai favorites."}
{"text":"First time here and the staff was friendly. The environment was welcoming!! The location is easy to miss if you wanted to just randomly pick a restaurant.   We ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup. Not sure if this was the authentic way of flavors because it was so sweet in taste almost like a desert. It taste different everywhere. We preferred it to have a more of a lime flavor with a mix of the coconut milk.   We also ordered the papaya salad which had flavors of the burning Thai chilie peppers!  Last but not least the Pad see ew!! It was delicious and flavorful.  We love to support the locals... The serving size was worth the price. We may come back and try other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Cravings for a cappuccino during the week of 10-2-16.  I hadn't been here for quite a while so I was very pleasantly surprised to find Cravings is now serving scrumptious looking Thai foods.  I was there around 8:00pm and the place was about half full.  I ordered a cappuccino (perfectly prepared) and wished I would have eaten dinner here.  I will definitely return very soon for dinner.  The menu illustrates pictures of all the items it offers.  When I saw what the diners were eating, wow, I was almost tempted to eat dinner all over again.  The food looks amazingly wonderful (and I rarely, if ever, use the word amazing.)"}
{"text":"Nice Thai place in rocky river with both indoor and outside seating. The exhaust is very poor if you sit inside. The service is efficient. Prices are reasonable.  The taro iced tea was tasty and rich.  The red curry had perfect spice for the kids and they enjoyed it.  The basil fried rice with veggies was scrumptious, not as spicy but the provided spicy dip/sauce was so awesome.  The haw mok with tofu was another dish comes in a banana plantain leaf and was yummy.  Lot of options and they have a bar and the margarita was good."}
{"text":"I was at work and didn't bring my lunch so a co worker and I decided to get take out from a great place (or so we thought). I got the spicy mama soup and fried spring rolls. The soup was ALL noodles which looked just like ramen noddle's, and 2 little pieces of chicken. The spring rolls were so greasy when you bit into it the grease ran down my face. I called the restaurant to let them know how bad the food was and I was told \" We sorry but everybody else loves our food.\"  I then asked to talk to a manager and she then said \" No we do not!\"  I would never ever go back to this place and I will discourage anyone I know to not waste their time."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago I would have given this place 5 stars.  Their coffee and espresso is still very good, but not great.  They used to be in an old renovated greenhouse which was one of the coolest locations in metro Cleveland.  Now they're in a new, cheap-looking free-standing building down the street from their old location (which was demolished for a housing development).  It's not their fault, but the place is just no the same.  Now the atmosphere is OK....it used to be great.  Still, this is one of my four (4) good coffee houses in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My FAV Thai food around! Love the Red Curry, Pad Thai, spring rolls, everything! So good!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place, especially with so many far superior and more authentic Thai restaurants nearby. The prices here are -way- overpriced (seriously $12 just for a simple vegetable pad Thai and upwards of $15+ if you want any meat in your entre). Also, simple appetizers like a summer roll ran for $8 or more. With prices like these, a typical meal (appetizer+entre+drink) could easily exceed $20-$25 per person. The prices DO NOT match the quality of food or service, either. Highly recommend other nearby more affordable and better quality Thai restaurants over this one."}
{"text":"I have recently been coming here for the bubble tea and I can't stop, I love it! All of the flavors are amazing. I've also tried their hand made pastries.... delicious"}
{"text":"This place has 2 different Yelp pages which may be because it was a coffee shop and is now a Thai restaurant AND coffee shop? Either way, it's a great place that shouldnt be missed so I'm posting my review for both pages.   I've been to Cravings twice and have really enjoyed my meals. The first time I stopped in for lunch. The lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu. I was craving curry and didn't see it on the menu. I asked if they had it at lunch and they said they would be happy to make it for me, and my dining companion as well. We tried red and green curry. Both were some of the best curries we've had. This place was instantly a new favorite.     I came back for dinner last weekend and brought the whole family. We all tried the green curry again, jungle curry, and tom yum soup.   I always order Tom Yum at Thai places and this has been one of, if not the, best Tom Yum I've ever had.  The soups and curries come in a large cup-like bowl. It doesn't look huge, but as soon as you start eating you realize it is like a never-ending bowl. Especially if you've ordered it Thai hot, like I always do. My face was literally dripping with sweat as I ate the entire bowl of \"8 on a scale of 1-10\" spice. I loved it. I would suggest something around 5-6 if you just want a regularly spiced meal. My dad ordered a 6 and his was pretty spicy too.    The dinner menu is actually quite extensive. There are several pages of entrees with photos (very helpful!) to choose from. We tried the calamari appetizer to share. It was ok. I wasn't really a fan of the fried breading as it was thicker than usual but I would not let it discourage me from ordering a different appetizer next time.    Oh, and another perk is that the ladies who work here are SUPER nice. Very attentive and always checking to make sure you are enjoying your meal.   The only negative I see is that the menu is a little on the pricey side, even at lunch. Not extreme for Thai food, but around $15-$20 for a curry dish (depending on choice of meat or veggies), $10 for Tom Yum soup, almost $20 for some of the other entrees. For the location of the place (ie not downtown or anything) I went in assuming it wouldn't be expensive at all, but obviously I went back and will go back, so I think the quality of the experience makes it worth it. It's a very nice atmosphere that is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Meal was good, but over-priced. Two entrees, a cup of soup and two bubble teas came out to $57 after tax and tip.  Thai Elephant in Kamms Corners is just as good and much more reasonable, from my experience. Farther away and not as convenient but worth the drive at that price."}
{"text":"We met last night to check out the good reviews we had seen for a local place.  So happy to report that the other reviews were spot on.  We arrived and were seated and offered a wine key for our BYOB wine.  We had the spring rolls, shrimp cakes (AWESOME & made FRESH), we each got to enjoy a cup of our own soup selection (lotsa shrimp in the cup), and we split the basil fried rice (mild was a bit spicey), and the green curry.  The chef came out to bring us some of our dishes, which added a nice personal touch to the meal.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time 3 weeks ago..thought the prices were a bit steep compared to other Thai restaurants in CLE and I've tried most of them; however, after reading all the positive reviews, wanted to check the place out.  I don't mind paying  extra for quality ingredients.  Shrimp cakes and many of the other appetizers were $8.95 for six or eight pieces depending on the appetizer...again, a little steep compared to other Thai restaurants.  The shrimp cakes, were very good, unique and the noodle dish I ordered tasted great (Rad Nar)  Then, I ordered carryout 2 nights ago and was in shock when I came in to pick it up.  All prices have gone up by $2-$3, which I didn't know until I picked up my order.  After seeing the size of my order of Thai Money Bags, and that the price had jumped to $10.95, I did the unthinkable- I refused the appetizer and asked to have it removed from my bill.  This was crazy, but they were so small...bottom line, it's ground pork filled wontons and they were the size of a quarter!  The server said yes all their prices have gone up...but that the ingredients are imported. (I'm sure the meat is not imported!)  My beef Pad Thai was $15.95 and it literally had 6 paper thin slices of overcooked beef.  And, the noodles were completely mushy and broken, which happens with rice noodles when they start disintegrating from the sauce.  It was not good.  I am sorry to say that I won't go back.  The prices are insane and it's just not great enough that I would go back .  There are too many other Thai restaurants in town.  Note, they have not updated their menu prices on the website or in their carryout menu, so if ordering take out, be sure and asked for the price."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience especially after reading some of the reviews.  Service was very late to start with, we set outside and it felt like we were forgotten about.  I have ordered the dinner duck dish. By the way, the menu has a description of every dish but also a picture of it. The dish that I have gotten was nothing like the pic of it. I got a bowl of carry soup with a few slivers of duck meat while pic representing the dish was of vegetables, curry sauce and 4 large slices of roasted duck Brest. By the way the dish is priced $18 Curry (sauce, pineapple chunks) was tasty but it was not worth $18. Very overpriced and misrepresented.  Ladies that serve are very sweet but disorganized and inefficient."}
{"text":"Been there once to eat in and got takeout once. The food is average at best and definitely way overpriced. They also aren't great at explaining their spice levels (american spicy or thai spicy) so my food was not spicy enough. Go to Thai Thai instead."}
{"text":"Poor service and always cold inside, but atmosphere is cute and food is pretty good. There were only 2 other customers besides my mother and I and we had to wait 5 minutes for the check and some boxes because the two people working there (10 feet away) were too busy chatting with one of their regulars to notice us. I eventually stared down the waiter to come over. I have been in there several other times, though not for food and it is always frigid. My mom was already wearing corduroys and a sweatshirt but had to go back for a jacket. The atmosphere is cute and the food was pretty good but I was really disappointed with the service for how not busy it was at lunch time."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some good boba tea & stumbled upon this place on my search online. I got the taro boba tea..it's the best boba tea that I've had in Cleveland. It wasn't too sweet, had a great flavor, & you get a decent size for the price.  I also ordered the chicken pad thai, veggie spring rolls, & beef fried rice. The pad thai was delicious! The chicken was too pale for my liking so, I didn't eat it. You get a nice portion for $12. I wasn't a huge fan of the fried rice...Thai fried rice is different than Chinese fried rice. The veggie spring rolls were really tasty & had a nice kick from the black pepper.  What's neat about this place, they have a drive thru so, you can pick your order without getting out of your car."}
{"text":"Great coffee, tasty treats, speedy wifi (15.5/5.5) and nice outdoor seating so my little dog can join me in savoring a croissant."}
{"text":"Wow! It had been years since the last time I was here when it was a mere coffee shop. I first came back to cravings a few weeks ago in a friends recommendation. The Food rivals the coffee for excellence. The coffee is extremely flavorful (try it before adding creme or sugar). The first dish I order was the jungle curry. PLEASE listen to the warnings about the 1-10 spicy level on this dish! Ive laughed at these warnings my whole life but a 7 on the jungle curry was my match. The food was amazing regardless of me burning my taste buds on spice . My second time back for food (I had been back for coffee one morning which was very good) I had the red curry. I ordered it at a 5 spicy and it was much more enjoyable. I'm going to have to make this a weekly meal. The staff and customers are all w trendily friendly. I'd recommend trying Cravings any day!  *UPDATE* I LOVE CRAVINGS! I eat here at least once a week now. Everything is always super fresh and flavorful. Every member of the staff is extremely kind. I can't get enough :-)"}
{"text":"Under new management since the start of this year. Came in on a Sunday and found the place pretty much empty. They have the typical coffee drink selection, quite a bit of baked goods, a small breakfast and lunch menu, and free wifi. I got a coffee and a cookie (came to $3.65 total). They also have a drive-thru and a patio area that faces the street. Quiet classical music radio station on inside, which was nice. Wifi was fast and the atmosphere was comfortable. The cookies are made there, and the oatmeal one I had was exceptional. Coffee was also pretty good. Not sure of the refill price because the barista just gave it to me. The lunch consists of mostly Mediterranean items, including homemade falafel and tabbouleh. They apparently have a Lebanese chef there at times. None was available when I was there, but they were also pretty slow. I really enjoyed the cookie. Very nice staff. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Very cozy coffeehouse. Perfect for relaxing on  a Sunday afternoon. I finished efiling taxes while I was here and with the soft music playing and warm atmosphere...it's just what I was looking for. The Iced Chai and Almond Poppyseed muffin were scrumptious also!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!!!!  My husband and I have been to Cravings many times and food was always good however take out was always somewhat not that great. Last night we ordered our usual, red curry with chicken (3) , pad Thai with chicken (3), spicy mama soup and spring rolls. The pad Thai was taste less as if they forgot to put any sauce or spice in it and the curry was watered down and lacked taste and chicken. When I called to complain, I was put on hold and than was told that they did put the right amount of chicken. No apology whatsoever. The food used to be great but the quality is not there anymore. So disappointing!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome and extremely willing to please! I went there with my girlfriend a week ago and had the pineapple fried rice and she had the Pad See Ew. They both were delicious and the portions were huge! Also, they were willing to adjust the spice level to your liking and both dishes were prepared with the requested spice perfectly. I am very excited to try more dishes made by their chef Tibby!!"}
{"text":"At some point recently, the nondescript coffee shop near my house started serving what they said was very authentic Thai food. The coffee shop is OK, but the Thai joint is really damn good. I'm no expert in authenticity, but I loved the variety, freshness and execution on the dishes we tried. Three Thai women in the kitchen suggested it was authentic, but the taste will have me returning soon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I loved the feel of this coffee shop/Thai restaurant. The patio was simple but pleasant, with umbrellas shading some tables from the sun. The interior felt exotic and interesting, with purple being the dominant color. I choose to sit outside, but I definitely would like to eat in the dining room in the future.  Service: I think we had three people, maybe four wait on us. Who we got to see was very random, but everyone was friendly and accommodating. I did wait awhile to get a to go box, but luckily I wasn't in a hurry.  Food: I ordered my favorite Thai dish, pad see ew. My food was good, and I did order it at a zero, but it could have used a little more flavor in the sauce, just in comparison to other restaurant where I've ordered the same dish. Other than that, I enjoyed it, and it was beautifully presented."}
{"text":"This place sure satisfied my cravings!   I got the opportunity to eat food from here when a friend of mine ordered it for a large group of people. We ordered a couple of the pad Thai's, some stir fried mixed vegetables with chicken, Thai fried rice, and spring rolls. Everything was absolutely fantastic. My dish of choice was the mixed vegetables with chicken since I do not eat rice and noodles. My meal was so flavorful for something so simple, which is usually hard to find when I eat out.   As an east sider, I wish this restaurant was closer to me, because then I'd be ordering from here all of the time."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand many times, and this is the best Thai food that I found outside Thailand   You have to try the Bingsu.   Snow Ice made from scratch and topped with lots of fruit and other delicious toppings"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats and got the pad Thai with a wonton soup.  Pad Thai was right on point could of been a little spicier but good none the less.  Wonton soup was a miss for me.  I prefer the broth with dumplings and some greens but this was a lot different than the traditional.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the curries here.  The depth of flavor is delicious.  We have tried every thai restaurant in the vicinity and this one surpasses them all.  A bit pricy but it's worth it!  My favorites are the Panang Curry and Masaman. We have taken friends here from out of town and they requested to come back the next day!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem Thai place.  Their ingredients taste really fresh. Haven't had a bad thing on the menu. Green curry is delicious. I love the tom kha soup with chicken. Each dish comes with custom spiciness- a 6 is actually pretty spicy for me and I like spicy food.    Btw, the Yelp hours say it's closed at 6 on Sunday but I ordered at 8:30.."}
{"text":"One of the reasons I joined Yelp is so I can scream from the rooftops when I find something I like and I love Cravings.  The food is delicious. I have been a Thai food addict for over 30 years and have never really been completely satisfied with many Thai places in the Cleveland area (and I've been to most of them). Cravings is definitely one of the best. Very authentic and tasty. The price is just slightly higher than normal, which would normally be a red light for me, but the quality of the food justifies the cost. Anyone who knows me knows that is saying a lot. Check them out. It's just over the Lake Rd./Clifton Bridge on the Rocky River side. Very easy to find."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland and I've probably tried them all, this rivals Map of Thailand near downtown. We had basil fried rice (vegan version), tofu triangles, spring rolls, coffee bubble tea and tiger cry (beef) salad. I thought it was expensive until I saw the portions, crazy huge compared to Map and Thai Hut etc, we did not need so much for 2 people. Will be back again! My husband picked it up and it was all ready in time but they made his tea fresh when he arrived. They have a drive through too for pick up. He said it was nice inside, good chill spot or date etc. I got medium spicy and it was pretty hot, sneaks up on you."}
{"text":"Outstanding delicious food with considerate and accommodating management! Fantastic fresh and healthy menu. If I lived in Cleveland I would eat here on a regular basis and be a healthier and happier person. I wish there was one where I live."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place and absolutely loved everything about it! From the drinks to the food to the relaxed environment and friendly staff, we will definitely be going back regularly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We flew home from a conference in Dallas, and my son offered to pick up Thai food for our family dinner. He and his wife had eaten at Cravings before, and loved it.  All I can say is their take out sucks. We ordered Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, Soup, Fried Rice, Calamari & a salad.  All of the noodle dishes were so dry, that we ate the protein and ditched the the rest. The Fried Rice was also very dry, and had an \"off\" smell. The Calamari would have been excellant had it not gotten soggy in the take out container. The Soup & Salad were excellent. We put some of the shrimp from the noodle dishes in the soup to add some volume.  We realize that take out can be a challenge, but compensating for noodle & rice dishes by adding more sauce, or using plastic take out containers would definitely help."}
{"text":"Ohhhh.....man!    I was seriously sooo excited in regards to deviating from my (very healthy & delicious) pre-planned Paleo meals that I have (mostly) been sticking to these last couple of weeks while here in Cleveland.  Time for an overdue overdue treat, -psych!  Green chicken (very diluted/watery) curry, -which came HIGHLY recommended to me moments before ordering,  a couple of shrimp spring rolls that were 80%+ iceberg lettuce (ughhh!) and of course my usual fave : although a good consistency, my taro slushie with Boba was light gray in color compared to the usual dark purplish gray color that pops with flavor, leave you wanting more, etc. etc.  -but this one tasted sugar-free or something it shouldn't be. So unfortunate.  :( But I gotta give some credit here and say that the peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls was on hit and the winner of this meal all on it's own.  And I did in fact take a couple of lil sips out of the tiny plastic container it came in all on and I must admit. Give me a pint, please!  De-lish!!    So, excluding the peanut sauce, ALL three items lacked any kind of significant flavor and just left me disappointed.  Had I dined in, I just may have had the nerve to send my items back. And I cringe as I say this and share this experience because who knows??...   -Maybe I just had the unfortunate luck to order the three most bland items on their  rather large menu.  Oh yeah, and $32- later.    On another positive note (along with the p-nut sauce) I must give credit to the ambience/inside mostly purple decor, the mouth watering aromas coming from the fresh pastries  & ground coffee beans,  the great customer service and the location.  And they even have little live music shindigs on the weekends, I believe.    I had such high hopes for their Thai cuisine.  On the flip side, Cravings Cafe offers an impressive and enticing wide array of coffee, coffee beans for purchase, chocolates, pastries, cookies and more and I'm thinking I couldn't have gone wrong had I gone that route with the java and sweets.  No such luck.  I'm still hungry with plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Cravings since Dec. 2014 is no longer just a coffee house. They revamped the coffee house in to a Thai Restaurant. I believe a new sign is to come. The chef is a women from Thailand who  makes what I believe is  the best  Thai food in Cleveland. A friend raved about it and I went the first time tonite. Its BYOB.  Fabulous food and good portion sizes. Those that I went with also enjoyed their meals  thoroughly. Fresh ingredients and tasty. Great Thai curry dishes. If you do not like things a little spicy make sure you tell them that as they are a little liberal with the hotness which was to my taste but may not be to others.  This will be my go to place from now on. Appears they do a good carry out as well. Glad its close to home and easy to get to as well."}
{"text":"Cravings is a true gem...it has a duo personality as it is also a coffee shop ..the coffee is great but the real star is the Thai  food ..quiet and relaxing space ..the staff is amazing as well."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful Thai restaurant with noodles, curry, bubble tea and much more. The pad Thai was delicious and plentiful. The spice for all the dishes is a 1-10 scale, but even the four was very spicy, so watch out. The staff was attentive and friendly. They had many food and drink options including a few beer and wine selections. My tofu pad Thai was about 13 dollars, but it could last someone two full servings. They also don't hold back on the peanuts!"}
{"text":"5 star review! Awesome little restaurant /slash/coffee shop. Very traditional and authentic Thai cuisine, awesome staff who are very friendly and knowledgeable.  You can set your own spice level by letting your sever know how much heat you can handle! Ask question, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. They appear to have a nice selection of coffee and teas. The Thai Tea I ordered was served with boba and quite nice. I had the Money Bags appetizer which was also very good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes deep fried wonton and Thai sausage. I also really enjoyed the Tom Kha soup, the flavors had a nice balance. The Massaman Curry was okay, I prefer it with a thicker consistency and richer flavor. Someone else I was with was trying it for the first time and they really liked it. The Laab was good but again, the flavor was not very pronounced.  In my opinion the prices were not the best considering what we got. We paid $60-$70 for three people and the serving sizes/flavor didn't match the price for me personally. This place may be good for some people but it's not really for me."}
