{"text":"This place is gross. I've gotten up 3 times to get my own napkins, water,and ask for a menu. It feels like a bunch of kids who are annoyed you're here. Food....gross. drinks...Fine, I guess, but why not go somewhere else. I have a huge plate of nachos with barely any cheese, flies and bees flying around my table. Now all the waitresses are having drinks and laughing at the bar. Noone else is."}
{"text":"This place has some real charm.  I have been there a couple times and the music is fantastic.  There are a couple veg*n options on the menu and a great selection of beers on tap (rickard's white? yes, please!) .  I want to go back and check out the patio."}
{"text":"Beer = good. Sliders = burnt meat nuggets on cold stale bread. Nice servers. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Barley Mill is one cool place. Ahem, pardon me - The Bow River Barley Mill Pub Company, that is. The historical building next to Eau Claire itself is cool - both the inside and outside have been immaculately renovated to have a rustic, old-timey feel with just the right amount of kitsch.  The walls inside are covered with wagon wheels, fishing rods, and other knick-knacks, and the bar upstairs is carved wood and polished brass, its shelves stocked with every type of alcohol imaginable.  I think most people know this place from Stampede Week, as this is a hot spot for locals to have a cold one on their three very large patios with abundant seating. I find the food to be \"hit or miss\", but the menu is quite varied and offers a little something for everyone.  The Bacon Mushroom Burger is a favourite among my guy friends - it is enormous.  My lady loves their yam fries with the dill mayo dip, which she substituted instead of regular fries with her sandwich for a small charge.   This trip I tried a few appetizers.  The mini Yorkies are little Yorkshire puddings stuffed with roast beef, horseradish sauce, and served with a bowl of au jus.  I thought they were just ok, but I appreciate seeing something other than just nachos on an appetizer menu.  The dry ribs were pretty good - they are boneless and have a faint taste of soy sauce and ginger which was different.  I'm quite the connoisseur of calamari, but I would rate this plate as a B-.  The portion size was small, the calamari was a bit rubbery, but the saving grace was the combination of spices that made it interesting.  In general, the Barley Mill has a great menu - a wide variety of items, and all of them reasonably priced between $11-15 on average for lunch. The wait staff left a little to be desired in terms of friendliness and personality, but in all fairness, it was a pretty busy Friday lunch, and they all worked together to be an efficient little team.  Our meals came out fairly quickly and still piping hot, and rarely did anyone have to ask for a beverage refill, so that says something!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Located by Eau Claire Market and Prince's Island Park, it's one of the best places in the area to grab some food in the late evening.  Usually, if I spend a day at the park, I'll end the day here.  The patio space is awesome; both upper and lower level options.  This is one of the rare places I've found in the city that will allow you to book patio space during the summer for large groups; one of my friends used it regularly to hold networking meetups every other month.  The food is great and reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very cozy and casual.  The service is awesome as well.  It's a smallish building and so it can get quite cramped in there if the place is packed, and upper level access is only served by a single stairwell, but it's hardly the only place in Calgary that has that issue, and for the most part, there isn't much to complain about the place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast for food quality and preparation . Saying something nice though, our server was great and it was taken off the bill... hence the extra star."}
{"text":"I've been two more times now and both times had very disappointing service.  Both times are on the popular lunch hours but that doesn't mean we don't deserve attentiveness.  The jalapeno burger was excellent. However, the next time I got the margarita chicken wrap and it was poor. I asked for no onions but told that it's pre-made so they can't do that. I reluctantly kept my order and sure enough the mix inside was dull, flat, boring, all of that... and my yam fries were over cooked.  Once we order the servers have completely forgotten about us, taken forever to come and clean up, or even bring our bill.  A simple lunch has easily turned into a 2.5hour ordeal because of the slow slow slow servers."}
{"text":"This was a decent spot for drinks and appetizers. It felt very different from other restaurants in Calgary.  They normally feel franchised, bland, etc.   This section of the city (Eau Claire) felt like an actual city with culture. I loved the patio and the atmosphere.  The service wasn't good. Our server was rude but apparently that's highly expected in Calgary.  We ordered nachos that could have fed 5 people. They should advertise that on the menu. They only gave enough salsa, sour cream, etc. for a regular size nachos and we were charged for more.   Overall, I would recommend this place, especially in the summer when you want to sit on a patio and enjoy some drinks."}
{"text":"Hiya Yelp Moderator!   My name is Jeffrey.  I would like to review Barley Mill.   But I'm a bit confused.  Um ... why are there two listings for Barley Mill Eatery and Pub?  Let's fix this!   And while we're fixing this, there are some things that we could fix about the Barley Mill Eatery & Pub, too.  It's an OK place, as in the food is edible and I wouldn't mind coming back here.  But I would be more inclined if somebody else were paying for me.  Like, say a company.  Or a sugar daddy.  Or a sugar mamma.  Or an alcohol company.   I ordered the meatloaf, which was actually really good, but the vegetable side dish it came with -- seasonal vegetables, which meant carrots and BOK CHOY (really?!  Kinda cool, kinda weird at an Irish bar lol) -- were disappointing, and to me, side dishes can be just as important as the meat.  They were unfortunately overcooked and too tasteless.   Dessert is also key to me.  My friend and I shared some peach cobbler -- which may have been my fault, because I usually don't go for peach.  That being said, it was the right sweetness but a little soggy; it's still OK as a dessert.   Service-wise, I think there were hits and misses.  We were 20 some people, and we had a reservation, but they didn't give us a space adequate for that many people.  They had to awkwardly coerce people to move as our party started arriving and it became clear that yes, we were actually 20 people!  Key word: awkwardly.  We had one waitress take care of us -- she wasn't particularly friendly, and was direct almost to the point of rudeness, but she did manage to keep the dinner moving, was very efficient, and also quite patient.   All in all, it was OK, and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here, but there's definite room for improvement."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey pie with side salad. Both were very good but left me still somewhat hungry. Would have given it one more star if it wasn't for the poor service. Our waiter seemed more concerned about his appearance than taking care of the customer. After receiving the bill we waited longer to pay than we took to order and eat our meal. Had to finally get the attention of another waitress. Place was not even half full, but lots of staff walking around socializing with each other.  Save your cash and go somewhere where they pay attention to their patrons and not so much their personal appearance."}
{"text":"A standard, quiet pub with a cozy interior and nice east-facing patios (ground and second levels). Service was subpar in our last two visits...the staff just seemed to be mailing it in. They have a rather fancy sounding wing flavour selection available, but to be honest with you we could barely tell the difference between the Mahogany and Coconut Thai Curry (!). One of the least desirable options in Eau Claire unless you're out for a midday patio beer or just a comfy evening beer with a small group by the fireplace."}
{"text":"AWFUL! The servers were terrible and made us wait 20 minutes for our server Paul to even come take our drink order then didnt check on us once for another hour, also got my order wrong. The manager was an absolute jerk and should not work in the food industry if he doesnt care abiut customer service. I recomend going across the street to Joeys."}
{"text":"Good beer, excellent service. New to town and met with exceptional bar tending a must in the area"}
{"text":"I'm really sorry, but this place kind of grosses me out.  I first visited The Barley Mill about ten years ago, when I first moved to Calgary as an undergrad.  I was out here with my parents, finding A Place to Call My Own, and we stopped in for a meal.  I remember it being dark and sticky, with a lot of fruit flies.  I didn't return.  Until recently.  I returned to The Barley Mill for the first time a few weeks ago.  I was meeting a friend for afternoon drinks, and when the weather turned bad we were forced to give up on our patio plans and head inside.  Little has changed in ten years.  I know the decor is supposed to be rustic and whatnot, but the finished effect is simply \"dirty\".  It just looks gross.  Our table didn't seem to have been properly cleaned, there were dusty surfaces, and yes- descendents of the original fruit flies still inhabit the restaurant.    After one drink I was ready to leave.  On the plus side, our server was polite, quick and attentive, so we were able to get in and out quickly.  Staying for a meal was out of the question, both due to the general cleanliness (or lack thereof) and the fact that the menu had few vegetarian choices for me.  Overall, not a winner.  As I was writing this review I couldn't help but feel like I was being a little overly-dramatic about the restaurant's cleanliness.  I guess the best thing to do when you read a review like this one is to check the Alberta Health Services inspection reports for yourself... they do seem a little better than my own perception of The Barley Mill."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Barley Mill! The atmosphere was really cozy and funky and we had great service. The food was also excellent. All together we tried the, Bison Shepherds Pie, Beef Dip, Haddock and Chips (with Halibut) and the Turkey Club Sandwich. Wow! All great. The Sweet Potato fries were nice a crispy and went good with the dill sauce. Although, the dill dip could have had more \"dill\" in it. The Shepherds Pie was essentially perfect with the bison really bringing in the taste.   Great beer on tap including Sam Adams! That is hard to find.   I wish that around the entrance of the women's bathroom it was a little cleaner as it felt like I was walking into the kitchen rather than the bathroom.  This is a great place and I can't wait to get back there and sit on the patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Food and service were decent at my last visit however the amount of insects in the dining room / bar were not. From fruit flys to house flys to beetles, my guest and I spent more time grabbing at these pests than we did enjoying our meals. We killed at least three that were swarming our drinks and our lunch.   Gross."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, decent prices.... patio was fun, beer was good... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for a work function, and I can say that they are 100% not equipped to handle large groups. Even though we had booked weeks in advance, they gave the 30+ people , 1 waitress.  That's right. 1 waitress.  The food when it came out was clearly from under a heat lamp (My cream sauce had congealed until it was no longer either, cream, or a sauce. It was more of a white paste similar to Elmer's glue.  I can't fault the 1 waitress, she tried. But what can you say? Barley Mill step up your game!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, good option for drinks and friendly staff. Would go back for sure. Nice location and not so crowded but let's see during the summer."}
{"text":"Arrogant staff and slow service. The food was good, but overpriced for a Humble hamburger and fries."}
{"text":"Our experience here today was subpar. We arrived largely before the rush yet it took nearly 25 minutes to order. Service was limited, our party waited 10 min for coffee refills. The portions sizes were good and prices reasonable but our eggs Benedict was cold and not cooked to order. Concerns were brought up to the manager but no recourse was taken to fix or make things right. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to the Barley Mill a few times and have to say I loved almost every experience. The building itself is quaint, and the area it's in is perfect - as it's right near Princes Island Park and literally next door to Eau Claire Market (and there is a patio to boot!).   I usually order a salad and have never been disappointed -  they're affordable, and always fresh (with the perfect amount of ingredients ...as their not chintzy with the good stuff).  I did however order the fish and chips once and was not very impressed. The salmon had almost no flavor and I found the batter to be way too heavy. Needless to say I did not eat it all ....which made me a little sad :( because I'm not one to waste food... lesson learned...should have ordered the salad...   Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place for a good salad, or a chill place to hang out."}
{"text":"Bar none, THE BEST mussels I have ever eaten!  I absolutely LOVE the mussels at the Barley Mill.  I never used to eat mussels because I didn't like them.  When I asked the waiter at the Barley Mill what their best item was, he said \"The mussels for sure\".  I decided to give it a try and fell in love with their chill lime mussels.  Mmmm!  I have since tried them at various other places, high end and not, and think these are THE BEST!  My husband loves the Beef and Barley soup, as well as the mini yorkies (yorkshire pudding).  The salads are also delicious!  Definitely a place for drinkers and eaters alike!  Go here.  You'll thank yourself :)"}
{"text":"Over the summer, me, my boyfriend and his aunt all got together on the patio of Barley Mill for some nachos and drinks.   First of all, the patio at Barley Mill is one of my favourite patios to visit during the summer. It's in a prime location (right beside Eau Claire Market) and it's covered in beautiful flowers. It's ALWAYS busy and the crowd is fun and friendly. Plus you're seated facing the Eau Claire Plaza, so there's tonnes of scenery to ingest.   The service we received was wonderful. Our server was efficient, quick and friendly.   I can't comment too thoroughly on the food, but I can say that their starters are great! Their nachos are delish, and their drinks hit the spot!   Plus once you're done eating, you can go for a long walk along the river, or go see an Imax in Eau Claire!   I am a big fan of the Barley Mill and you can be sure to find me on the patio as soon as summer is back!"}
{"text":"We only stopped by for drinks but the staff was super nice and the place is warm and cozy! Hoping to try the food soon so I can add to the review!"}
{"text":"I havent even tried my food yet, but service is worth 5 stars. I'll change it to 4 if the food is horrible.  We came here after leaving a horrible experience at another restaurant.  Great friendly and accomodating staff."}
{"text":"Nothing nicer than having lunch on a patio on a beautifully blue sky day! A bit of a walk from the downtown core, but the food was definitely worth it.   Quite a spacious patio area with enough tables and chairs, with umbrellas for the strong midday sun. Service was quite good overall, with the servers coming up to the table quite frequently, despite lunchtime rush. Beers were quite good, with server coming to help us refill, but the food unfortunately took way longer than even the restaurant expected. They had enough servers working, but the kitchen must have been understaffed as it ended up getting 45+ min to get our food! My friend eventually got a beer on the house (as that even took 10min to get), and the manager came to apologize profusely for the long wait.  However, the food definitely made up for the wait! The burgers were amazing and my Short Ribs were done very well! Super flavourful and came apart easily! Not sure if I was just extremely hungry, but it was very good!  If you plan on going during the lunch period, and are the Eau Claire area, definitely worth a try. Just make sure you have enough time to sit and wait, in case they are super busy again."}
{"text":"I was starving, it was as if the world was about to end and I still haven't had my 'last meal'. We were headed to The Barley Mill for lunch - about 20 of us which I understand may be a large number for a lunch however restaurants I feel should be prepared that numbers like this will happen and will probably always happen.  The Barley Mill is a restaurant situated inside a cozy small house. Like I've said previously I love places like this, it has that old cottage feel mixed in with an irish pub interior. This restaurant has a main floor as well as an upstairs floor.   The server was kind enough to get us our drinks right away and that's about where the good service stops.  I ordered the Chimchurri Sirloin which is an 8oz certified Angus Sirloin that comes with Roasted Potatoes, Asparagus and Chimchurri sauce.  Everyone placed their order with the waitress and we began our wait....and kept waiting.. a manager came up: \"I checked for everyone the food is coming.\" Another 30 minutes goes by and by now we've been waiting one full hour for our food to come while everyone else in the restaurant seems to be getting served. We continue waiting... and waiting..and finally our food arrives 1.5 hours later.   During the time we were eating another manager comes up and apologizes and says there were problems in the kitchen and they kept sending the food back in. Well... they should have just made it right the first time.  My steak I ordered medium rare and it came out about medium but besides that the steak wasn't bad but I've had a lot better in many other restaurants. The Roasted Potatoes were the worst, dry, hard and felt like they were old. The Asparagus was delicious and you know how I love my greens and finally what made my meal a little better was the delicious Chimchurri sauce.  I don't think I'll be back here unless it's just for a beer. My meal came to $20 but I honestly don't think it was worth it having to wait 1.5 hours for my food to come."}
{"text":"I had one of the tastiest meals I had eaten in a long time. I order the baked Mac and Cheese, which comes with a side salad.  Both the Mac and Cheese and salad were delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant. There's someone in the kitchen who knows what good food tastes like."}
{"text":"First timers here and we were lucky to score a nice seat on the lower patio on a scorchingly beautiful, sunny Canada Day. Best service we have had in awhile in Calgary and we had a really good time! The crowd was mature and the vibe was relaxed. Drinks were cold and the waitress was good enough to keep the ice water coming! We shared a micro greens salad which was actually very good, quite refreshing. The cranberries that I had been looking forward to never made it on the plate - maybe they were out? I would get that salad again though. There were many things on the menu I would love to try that focus on fresh as opposed to fried which I love. (soups, chicken lime tacos, turkey burger, chicken and fig salad, calamari etc!)"}
{"text":"Barley Mill is a decent place if you happen to be in the area.  The beer selection is pretty good and the pub food is acceptable."}
{"text":"A great casual lunch or post work spot in a gorgeous part of town.  When the sun is shining, The Barley Mill Patio is one of my favourite places to stop after a bike ride down the river pathway.  I'm a sucker for british style pubs, especially if they're located in an old house style buildings, and the Barley Mill is definitely no exception. Steak and Guiness pie, bacon wrapped meatloaf - if it's made to go with potatoes an gravy, the Barley Mill does it right!  \"But wait! Seconds ago I was sprinting my bike down the river pathway. I don't want to kill my exercise endorphins with comfort food, I want a salad!\" It's cool, it's cool! Believe it or not, salads are still very much good choice here!  I've been right into the roasted chicken and fig salad - goat cheese, garlic, cranberries, some kind of wonderful figgy sauce  I've spent the last 4 years eating my way through their menu during work lunches (and liquid lunches on Fridays) and waiting out the rush hour C-Train traffic with a few pints. Well worth checking out if you're feeling casual."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Had the fish and chips and they were yummy. Food was really quick to come out too"}
{"text":"Food and service are great.  Seems like the crowds that used to frequent here have moved on.  Great because there is lots of room but dad to see as this place is a hidden gem that has always been great."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is in a great location right downtown in Eau Clair Market and therefore has a great parking lot beside it (but you have to pay for the parking). Eau Clair always has lots of events going on so be sure to go to the Barley Mill when there is not an event downtown or in Eau Clair or maybe make a reservation in advance to be sure you will get a table and not have a long wait.  Given that it is right downtown and usually restaurants downtown are expensive.. this restaurant is not. It has great and very reasonable prices.  To eat we got: green beans, lobster rolls and bacon patties.  I love that this restaurant also has three patios- one out front, one out back and a roof top patio.  Even though I loved this restaurant so much I only have it a three star because they asked if we wanted to be seated on the patio or inside when we arrived and we said patio, the back patio. It was great they had a DJ that played great music but wasn't too loud. She took our drink orders but never brought food menus so my Mom went inside and got us our own food menus. We chose what we wanted and the next time the waitress came .. she took the menus away and not our order because she said we weren't aloud menus out here because we weren't allowed to eat food on this patio.. that would have been nice to know and no one told us that!  The other thing was for drinks we got white sangria which was delicious. For one glass it was $7 and we heard the waitress say for a pitcher it was $20 and it would give us 4-5 glasses so we got that. When the bill came the pitcher was $28 so we told her she told us it was $20 and all 3 of us heard her say that and she said no that she said $28 which isn't a good deal for it and if we would have known that we wouldn't have got it. Therefore the restaurant loses a star for each of these incidents."}
{"text":"Arrogant host, stand offish waitress, slow service....good food, nice looking place."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Just don't order food here if it is busy.    Don't order  the nachos.  Probably the saddest excuse of Nachos I've ever had.    Truffle fries are gold as long as you get them hot.  It is a great place to sit and chit chat if you want a nice cold one, and enjoy watching people mindlessly walking around Eau Claire Market playing Pokémon go.    The environment is great. The waitress was putting on a brave face and doing her best.   The lack is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Prime patio location with a good selection of food and beer.  Grabbed a quick lunch here and was provided with a good sandwich and good service. The server recommended a good beer to drink and provided everything you would expect. Now my overuse of the word good is not by accident because that's really all this place is. There is not too much special about it. The service was well timed and everything but our server just wasn't friendly. Maybe she was having a bad day?  I won't be rushing back but won't go out of my way to avoid it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Barley Mill! My boyfriends British friend recommended the place after we mentioned what part of the city we were staying in, Eau Claire.  The place has a cozy feel, I loved the antique decor and the fire places.  I ate the tequila lime tacos which were SO tasty, and tried a bunch of the different local beers they had on tap. The boyfriend had the Mac and cheese which had a bunch of cheeses I never heard of, and a side salad with a bunch of nuts. He said it could have been a bigger portion.  We met some cool people, a group of bicyclists who said the area is the prime meet up spot of Calgary.  Overall, a really nice place that I would go to again!"}
{"text":"Disappointment at every turn.  The place was dirty. I guess the person who cleaned it badly needed glasses, and had left them at home.    Menu was boring. Food was bland, except for the soup, which really was home mede. Too bad the person making it used so much salt. It was almost inedible.   Our beers were awful, the beer must have gone bad. We asked our server if we could return it after two sips, and she said no... What the heck?   Our server didn't have a clue as to what was on the menu, and we had to ask three times for napkins.   Outdoor seating was nice  Forget this place, go to Joey Eau Clare, right across the street"}
{"text":"I've taken friends and family and attended business functions at this restaurant (the Barley Mill) for twenty years and an honestly say I have never been disappointed with the quality of the experience, food or service. The staff are always pleasant and efficient, the food always well prepared and the overall experience (loudness of music, cleanliness, location, menu, etc) always spot on. The only trouble is that on a dreary and blustery  winter day the comfortable chairs and warm fireplace upstairs can be awfully hard to leave."}
{"text":"If you need a local watering hole, this is your spot. Their mussels here were good especially w their grilled ciabatta that comes with it."}
{"text":"Our waitress was  the shinning star of this adventure. The barley mill was 1/3 full when we arrived and the hostess seemed completely hungover and out of it as she pronounced we would have to wait to be seated. The waitress who had 6 tables could not handle any more. Once seated a new waitress appeared and improved the scenario. Bright, fun, and very polite she rocked her tables. Kitchen was slow to produce the food. Almost 40 minutes however my medium well steak came out perfect so all in all was well worth the wait.   Would have been a solid 4 if it wasn't for the hostess and the first waitresses laziness."}
{"text":"The Barley Mill is what I like to call a fun place.  Nothing really separates it from other pubs in the city, but every time I've gone it's been a great experience.  In fact, each time I've gone has been for pretty different reasons.  I've been for the normal reasons, sure, like to get drunk or grab a quick meal during lunch.  But I've also been for work functions, stampede parties, birthdays, and other reasons I can't remember thanks to the large amount of alcohol consumed.  Each time was great fun.  The normal experiences always exceeded my expectations.  The service was great, the food was above average for a pub-style location, and the people always friendly.  I'm not sure what it is, but everyone always seems to be enjoying themselves at Barley Mill.  The group functions is where they really shine though.  And really, being downtown, they have to.  I imagine they get a lot of business from downtown corporations wanting to hold events there.  We recently attended a work function for my fiances employer where they had rented out the entire upper level.  The food, while only finger food, was really good and well prepared.  The service was, yet again, fantastic.  Barley Mill has lots of options for sitting outside.  They have a patio around back that fills up quickly.  They also have a narrow patio running along the upper floor that provides nice views and a bit more privacy for smaller groups.  I most definitely recommend visiting Barley Mill the next time you're downtown."}
{"text":"The Barley Mill has the best patio in downtown proper. Because it is right by Eau Claire Market and Princes Island Park, you get a beautiful view of lush green and some interesting architecture, and tons of people watching. Now that it is winter and minus thirty outside, I can't help but imagine being out on the patio after a long day with a cool beer in the hot sun. When I think of the Barley Mill, I immediately think of sun.  That being said, it's a nice place in the winter too. It's one of the only places in Calgary that is genuinely old, and so it has a wonderful old character. The lower level fills up pretty quickly and the booths are fun. Everything is made up of old dark wood, and it is a pleasure to sit and enjoy. Upstairs you can get more privacy - there is even a little room off to the side which is perfect for small meetings and get-togethers.   But I can't go back until I stop wishing for the sun shine (this is a allegorical statement about how the summer = the Barley Mill in my mind and also that Winter is sad. Also, the Barley Mill is not connected to the Plus 15 system so you have to make a run for it on the final block and running in windy -30 weather isn't worth it in the end, not even for after work drinks. Yeah, I'm a fair weather customer at the Barley Mill.)"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to TBM, situated between the edge of the business district and the turquoise Bow River running through Calgary, putting the South Platte in Denver to shame. We dined alfresco, a first for me since I'd only visited TBM before during the winter. Regardless, the mini-Yorkies were the same wonderfully perfect dinner-sized snack: Make sure you have help eating these if you order them. Service was good and friendly. Beer cold and wet."}
{"text":"AAAARRRGGGGGHHH, I hate parking down by the Eau Claire Market on a weekday; it is so grossly overpriced to park there, imagine the friend who had to meet her lawyer then meet us for lunch paid $27 dollars all day parking because it would be more expensive for her to pay for 4 hours.  That out of the way, meeting her for lunch at The Barley Mill was the most convenient lunch spot but looks like it was on everyone's minds today because man was it filled.  There wasn't an empty seat in the house and it was uber noisy.  The exterior is like a rustic turn of the century home that I have seen in the ghost town of Dawson City, the interior comparable to a Northern Lodge.  The fire a blazing and antique ornaments like an old wagon, old tins and grinders hovering overhead.  It's pretty cosy if you can ignore the loud music and ambiance.  We were served right away but I was being nudged several times by people and servers passing through as there wasn't much sitting room today.    My friend had a turkey and strawberry sandwich on white with yam fries, my other friend had a soup and salad combo and I had the fish and chips.  Everyone was pretty content with their meals but I must admit I was disappointed in having just one fish filet at 13 dollars.  The service however was excellent; friendly responsive servers, quick to take orders, mention specials and get you the food.  I think I would rather come on a less busy day and take advantage of the intimate seating and great views on the upper floors.  Other than that stupid parking inconvenience and not being able to hear our conversation, I can't really complain."}
{"text":"I've experienced better service.  I was going to give a 4-star review but a small gesture from the server just wiped a star off :-))"}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague to grab a quick bite. So we got the chili lime mussels. They were pretty good for the price and the taste. Not like wow but for $14 and the portion size, its reasonable. Service was good. Nothing too special. I do like the garlic bread though that went with it.   We came at 4:00pm and it was pretty quiet. We were like the only people in the restaurant. Too bad they don't have happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Hit up the patio with the husband. I drank Chardonnay while he drank a few beers. We ended up sharing a burger and a side Caesar as well. Def a great option for a patio downtown - especially is joeys is packed."}
{"text":"You know what? For awhile, the Barley Mill was sitting at a solid 3.5 stars. The food is alright, the selection of beers is decent, the location and the patio are both wonderful.   I've been by on many an occasion and the service has always been a-ok. I can't complain about the prices either. They're reasonably for the quality and quantity of food you receive. But what pushed this up to a 4 star? Why, the follow up service I received from one of the managers, Kyle, after I thought I had left my debit card there.  I was there on a Monday, and it wasn't until Wednesday that I figured out I had left my card somewhere. Trying to retrace my steps, the last place I remembered using it was at The Barley Mill. I phoned, and the server on the other end took my name and number and promised she'd have somebody get in touch with me. Well, a few hours had passed and I have expected no-one to call me back. I went about my business the rest of the day. Later, when I glanced at my phone, I saw a new voicemail. It was The Barley Mill calling saying they had had a look around, but hadn't come across my card. \"We'll keep looking and do everything we can to find it on our end,\" the message assured me.   The next day, I came across my card on the floor of my car. I must've stuck it in my pocket instead of back in my purse on the way out. So, problem solved! But great follow up from Kyle and his team that day. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"One star is off because 3 members of my party did not love their food as much as my daughter & me.  The short rib was tender and delicious.  We even loved the potatoes & veggies.  I recommend ending your meal with the chocolate martini."}
{"text":"We had a table on a roof top patio. It was a pleasant day. The service was good. The food was good. Nothing special, but not sorry we ate here."}
{"text":"Certain things doesn't change, unfortunately - one of them is Barley Mill.  Five years ago it was a rather worn-out, uninspiring pub only good for a corporate drinking event - and recently I had a chance to take a second look, finding the place exactly the same.  Certain traditions, though, are worth breaking. How about replacing these floors, looking like they physically couldn't be cleaned anymore. Or at least these eternally rustic pieces of furniture?  I mean, it's obvious that Barley Mill enjoys a prime location in one of the main downtown pedestrian areas. It almost feels like it's abusing it, though - knowing all too well that there will always be clients.  Food, drinks and service... well... ordinary Canadian pub stuff. Once again - good enough to fill bowls of tacos for a corporate party, but that's it.  I won't recommend visiting Barley Mill from tourist perspective for a romantic brunch or dinner... oh wait, no! In fact, this is an exact model of how Calgary's downtown \"cultural district\" and its \"attractions\" look like. Which is, unfortunately, nothing to be proud of."}
{"text":"Just riding a bike close to Eau Clair Market!! We want to eat fish and chips.. Never been Barley Mill.. But it never make us disappointing.., So yummy fish and chips.. Fresh, crispy.. Highly recommend !!! We will come back really sin!!!"}
{"text":"Classy old school pub. Came here for an American event that was hosted by my fellow Americans - a voting event by Democrats abroad. The pub has a good selection of beers on tap, and friendly cute bartenders. Would like to come back and try the food next time."}
{"text":"We were in Prince's Island Park on a Sunday and wanted to find a pub/restaurant with a patio where we could drink a cold beer and eat lunch.  I think it was the first day of the year to hit +20 celcius.  We were informed of a 15-20 minute wait for the patio and were served in the bar while we waited.  The staff appeared overworked because they had no bartender and the waitresses were left to prepare all the drinks for themselves.  Pretty much all the beer that's on tap is domestic beer without much beyond the \"fancy\" beers from major brewers such as Molson or Rickard's.  Despite this in 15 minutes we had our seat like promised.  I ordered the Black Angus Sirloin Sandwich with yam fries.  The food came out promptly which was surprising considering the understaffed situation.  The steak was well salted and peppered and extremely tender.  It was a great cut without any sinew/grissel.  The yam fries were salted with sea salt and it was served with some dill mayonnaise to dip the fries in.  The fries were cooked to just the right crispness.  We were disappointed at all with the food.  Nothing appeared off from the beer that was on tap.  We only wish that the management had been better prepared for the summer weather and the increased traffic it would bring their restaurant.  We arrived with good timing because 15 minutes after we were seated a lineup was forming outside the door to the restaurant.  I'm pretty sure that those that arrived during the rush didn't get the prompt service we received."}
{"text":"Always good for a beer. Suffers from classic inconsistent Calgary service. Sometimes its good, last time upstairs, she was right unhappy.  Great location, cool ambience. see a movie, have a beer after. Its my go too when in Eau Claire market."}
{"text":"Meh. I am sort of torn.  We were going to hit the busier restaurants on 17th Ave, but due to wait times, we settled on a quieter, less busy venue.  So keep in mind that I was hoping more for a culinary treat when we enter the establishment. To be fair.  Portions were decent and service was fantastic.   Food overall was ok.  The appetizer portions were huge, but the calamari I ordered to start tasted more of grease that needed to be changed.   The steak sandwich was cooked to the rarity that I asked but while overall was tender, was still fairly dry. It definitely could have used a steak sauce to up the moisture.   Definitely no worries getting a seat. Would I eat there again? Likely not with the other choices available In town."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4 star as a bar, but just don't have the food. Great patio for the summer, good beer, nice atmosphere, and friendly service.   We tried a few of the apps that were recommended by the waitress as standout, and there were, in a bad way. Would really never eat here again but will gladly have a beer."}
{"text":"For those of us who work on the north end of downtown, this is one of the great places to go for an after work drink. The food is OK, but nothing terribly special.  I would say that it is one step above standard bar food.  Great patio for those warm summer days!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give a bit higher rating. But the food disappointed. I had shepherds pie and there was an odd aftertaste to it. I think from the Village Brewery Blacksmiths black ale used in cooking it. Perhaps if they had it on tap to pair with it the taste would be okay. Instead it just had an off taste to it. Service was good, though. Making sure beers were never empty. Not overly friendly though. Only talked as much as she had to. May come back. We'll see."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a beer after work or on the weekends. I would not recommend the calamari however, when I eat there the  after was off. The waitress wasn't the best at regularly checking in. We ordered our drinks and she forgot to ask us about food. We waited 15 minutes for her to come back. They have a great beer selection though."}
{"text":"Nice quick service and a good full range of draught beer."}
{"text":"There was a large group of us, about 20+, for an office function.  I guess it was the wrong day to sit outside on the patio 'cos it was quite a cool day.  So, we asked to have the patio heaters turned on.  For some strange reason, only one waitress was assigned to our large group.  We had to wait for drinks, then we had to wait to order appetizers, then we had to wait for the waitress to turn on the patio heaters.  Meanwhile, the guys in the group got up to help her turn the heaters on.  Then we had to wait to place our lunch order.  By this time, it's been 1 1/2 hours since we've sat down before we got lunch!  Unbelievable!  I ordered the Mussels and a starter Caesar Salad.  The mussels weren't bad and it was a fair-sized order.  Sauce was pretty good - chilli lime.  The Casear Salad - meh, i've had better.    Ladies Washroom - only 2 stalls, one of which does not have a lock.    Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fireplace upstairs....legit food with above average food.  The service was quick and the coffee never stopped.  It wasn't very busy when I went. I can see, given it's location, this pplace being absolutely packed in the summer.  I will have to check out the patio in the spring."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Friday afternoon, and it was completely dead.  You would think service would be better being the only party in the place, but no.   Apparently the server had other things to do besides her job, such as chatting with the other staff.  The beers were tasty, and the food was good, but the service ruined the place for me."}
{"text":"A comfortable dark bar with an admirable 87% craft-to-garbage beer ratio. Steak and beet salad enjoyed in the shadow of curling, endless curling."}
