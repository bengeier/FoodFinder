{"text":"I'm a Cajun that has spent most of the last decade of my life in New Orleans. I generally refuse to eat at most \"Cajun\" restaurants even back in LA and am extremely hard to please. I met Ben when he was slinging poboys at wiggle barrel house and after a delightful conversation i was served two incredible sausage and shrimp poboy on crispy Gambino's bread. I was so happy I almost cried! He's got my full seal of approval. If you want authentic Louisiana food fine Ben and his truck full of Cajun happiness!"}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon PGH Po' Boy on Small Business Saturday on a sudden trip to the Pittsburgh Public Market.   Ben let us place our order and then walk around while he prepared our food - a nice gesture that I am not sure everybody would think to offer.   When we came back our order was ready. I had the shrimp po' boy and my fiance had the crawfish grilled cheese. The po' boy was fantastic. Was it messy, as previous reviewers have said? Yes. But does that speak towards the quality of the food? Not in my book. A lot of the best food I had in my life was some of the messiest food I had -- this wasn't even some of the messiest, yet it still was some of the best.   I had a bite of the crawfish grilled cheese and it was equally as good -- I have subsequently ordered it as my main dish now.   Furthermore, Ben gave us a small sample of the gumbo, which was some of the best gumbo I have had in my entire life.  Bottom line is, the food is great. If you have the time to talk to Ben, the conversation is equally as good.   Excellent people and excellent food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing New Orleans inspired cuisine right here in Pittsburgh at the Public Market. Ben, the owner, has to be one of the nicest and most genuine business owners that I have ever met. The gumbo is delicious, just spicy enough with lots of good quality meat and vegetables! The crawfish grilled cheese was so good and such a large portion for the price. I want another one right now! From muffalettas to po boys, you have to try this food! I go to New Orleans several times per year and this is the closest you will get to this kind of cuisine in Pittsburgh. I know a lot of pittsburghers are \"scared\" to try new things but do yourself a favor and branch out of the norm and get to Pittsburgh Po Boy!!"}
{"text":"Gumbo - awesome. Lots of andouille sausage, well spiced, flavorful not watery.  Grilled Shrimp Po'boy - Great, a little messy (lots of fantastic remoulade) and a little pricey, but it's a big sandwich. Hefty portion of cajun seasoned shrimp w/ lettuce & pickles. The bun was toasted perfectly so that it was soft, yet slight crispy without being tough or hard.  Very friendly service.  Menu looks like it will change seasonally or even weekly, looking forward to going back, will update after getting different menu items."}
{"text":"Finally some good Cajun in western PA!! Gumbo and po boys are awesome. I am from the South and have had numerous po boys in New Orleans and this tastes like the real deal."}
{"text":"I had the Andouille sausage po'boy at the wine walk in Zielenople. It was fantastic! It had a good amount of spice, but not too much. The flavor was great! This is one of the best subs I've had."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while wandering around the strip district and wasn't hungry for a big lunch so we decided to try their gumbo. Glad we did as it was delicious. Piping hot, a good portion, and wonderful flavor.  Hope to make to back down to try one of their PO boys sometime soon. With more gumbo of course."}
{"text":"While I do love me some po boys, I went w/ chicken & sausage gumbo today.  I chose well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm only giving the food truck 4 stars because I didn't eat anything from there.  My partner, however, LOVED it!!!  I don't blame her, either.  She ordered a shrimp Po' Boy, and it looked amazing!  I almost wanted to ditch my 20 years of being a vegetarian to try it.  The perfectly seasoned shrimp was spilling out of the sandwich, the bread was fresh, all around a fantastic looking sandwich.  There's no doubt we'll be tracking down where this food truck goes.  I can't wait to find something on the menu I can try."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a few menu items and have never been disappointed. The truck is clean, locations vary so you can find it on a regular basis, Ben is very friendly and thr food is outstanding. The grilled shrimp po boy, chicken and sausage gumbo, bread pudding, corn maque choux and the blackened chicken po boy are all excellent choices. The prices are fair and many of the places I found the food truck introduced me to other businesses such as a brewery and a coffee shop. I've had many of these menu items in New Orleans and this food is certainly authentic. Seasoned well, great portions and the variety makes you want to see where they're going next so you can try something new. I love that food trucks are becoming more popular in the Pittsburgh area and they're covering multiple cooking styles."}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place a 3.5 as is. Firstly. It is the Pittsburgh Public Market, which is full of cool vendors, but it is a little bit further from the heart of the Strip.   Anyways, I've been craving some Cajun food and there aren't too many places in the Burgh specializing in this cuisine in my opinion. When I was looking for something different in the Strip I was surprised that I've never heard this was on the area and immediately was thinking of my trip to Mardi Gras with delicious po' boys.  So I made the trek a couple extra blocks and got the andouille sausage po' boy and the gumbo. I'm not an expert, but the po' boy was not quite what I remember. It was good, but difficult to eat. The bun was falling a part and toppings were falling as well. Not totally surprising, but the sausage was difficult to bite off and left me using my fingers to break it a part. The shrimp probably would've been a better choice.  As for the Gumbo, I liked it too, but the roux had a bit too much flour in it for me and the rice was a tad undercooked.   All things considered it was good but the price was a tad steep at $11 for about a 7\" po' boy and $4 for the gumbo was a little fairer in my opinion. Overall, worth a shot of you are looking for something different, but then again there is no shortage of options in the Strip District."}
{"text":"The Pgh Po'boy Truck came to cater lunch for my office, and we were very pleased with the experience!  Really good food - great gumbo, delicious bread pudding.  The owner, Ben, is extremely friendly and super accommodating.  Service was fast.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"All the gumbo I have ever eaten or cooked had chucks of meat.  For $9 you get rice little to no veggies, a sauce base and chicken and sausage that was put thru a meat grinder on fine setting. Not spicy at all. Google Gumbo and she what it really looks life. Never again."}
{"text":"I just had the opportunity to indulge myself on the Shrimp Po' Boy today. The shrimp was seasoned just like I've eaten down in New Orleans. The remoulade (spicy mayo) had a great kick to it. For the price, the ratio of shrimp to bread was just right. It did take me a few bites to get into the sandwich but, the further along I got, the more it reminded of the authentic po' boys I've eaten in the past while visiting New Orleans. Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Great little place inside the Pittsburgh Public Market. The offer Gumbo, Muffalettas, and Po Boys along with a few other things. I ordered a Shrimp Po Boy. The sandwich had lots of grilled shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and a spicy remoulade. It was served on a warm bun that was perfect for a Po Boy. I lived in New Orleans for a couple of years so I know good Cajun food. This is good Cajun food. Can't wait to go back and try a Muffaletta."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good PO Boy, they have it.  The Pittsburgh PO Boy truck sure delivered.  While many places have PO Boy sandwiches most are pretty non-discript & do not have much flavor, not so the Pittsburgh PO Boy.  Ordered the Shrimp PO Boy that was Spicy with lettuce, tomato and a spicy remoulade.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the remoulade was great."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp po boy and really was well prepared. Out of this world remoulade. Gambinos bread from 'nawlins need i say more. I will. The shrimp were plentyful finely shredded iceberg, crispy tomato, and the chef prepares himself and cares about the quality. Try em out. You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Po Boy and really enjoyed it. The flavor was a little spicy  for me but very tasty."}
