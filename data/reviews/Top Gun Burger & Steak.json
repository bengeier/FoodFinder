{"text":"Wow! Finally a burger joint that delivers on expectations and then some. I got the Avenger burger and it was huge! Had a sword like toothpick in it to keep it from falling over. Tasty too, my only complaint is that the beef bacon was a little tough to eat. Although once you get into the burger after the initial bites the bacon works too. Enough fries so that I could enjoy some on my way home and have plenty when I actually got to the burger. It was like those enormous burgers you see on American tv and can't usually get around here. Not bad on price too, about $20 for a combo but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not worth the 25 Min wait for a burger! 
To add insult to injury they didn't get my order right"}
{"text":"I've waited a very long time to eat at top gun. After tonight I will never come back.
I'm keeping this short. I waited 22 mins for a burger, multiple waitresses kept coming to me with the wrong order. I finally got my burger, I was still hungry after eating and there was no way I could wait more.

Service is deplorable. No wonder you ask for tip prior to eating.

Burgers are nice very nice but not worth the wait. Come in hungry and left hungry. Never again"}
{"text":"Ordered the Avenger burger with fries for $16.99.

The Avenger comes with 2 beef patties, beef bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was a really great tasting burger with a lot of flavour. If you want a filling burger that  isn't just your average cheeseburger, than the Avenger is a must try.  The fries were also well seasoned and with a good portion given. 

This Markham Road location is a bit bigger than their Lawrence franchise, but it's still relatively small in my opinion. It gets really busy during prime hours and after 8:00 as well. Don't expect them to make certain burgers (The Hurricane for example) that take them longer than normal to make when it's really busy. I wish that wasn't the case however, because if a customer is willing to pay and obviously wait longer  for the burger to be made, than I say their shouldn't be an issue. 

Regardless, I'm a fan of their food and i'll definitely be coming back to try their other burgers."}
