{"text":"bof, le repas était pas à la hautteur de mes attentes, je crois même que pour le prix, j'aurais eu meilleur au casse-croûte un peu plus en bas de la rue."}
{"text":"Ok..first time here. Hoping for authentic Hatian food....Served quickly but I must be really picky. Rice and beans served warm not hot, three overcooked chicken legs no thighs. Pikles was nice. Priced ok. Rest meh... Will not be returning any time soon. Didnt warrent a food pic. 2 stars for ambiance. Good music"}
{"text":"A Haitian friend recommended me this small restaurant and i'm glad she did. I started with the fried calmar and it was pretty good,  not the best I had but worth taking if your in the mood for something fried. I had the griot and it's not your traditional kind were there is a mix of fatty meat and pieces of meat with no fat,  some of you know what I mean, all the pork had no fat and I kind of like it more when it's made more traditional were you get all those fatty pieces because to me it adds a bunch of flavor more. I got the beer they have imported  from Jamaica but it costed me 7$ so to me it was not worth it. The service was great and the food was good, I'm definitely coming back!!"}
