{"text":"In my opinion, their deep fried dough is much better than Sam's. I felt so sad when they closed. Recently, rumours said it would reopen soon at the same address. I'll look forward to it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite congee restaurant, so happy it's back. It's the same place that used to be inside the t&t"}
{"text":"Really good cheap congee! I love good cheap congee places, it's comfort food. The noodle dish j got however, wasn't that good. The only reason I got it is because the lady kept telling my mom to try it."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp as I am craving for a congee breakfast. The congee is excellent!! It's hot, creamy, not too thick or too watery, with quite appropriate amount of meat and other ingredients inside. I will give it a score of 10 out of 10.  The dry donut rolled with rice noodle is not bad. I expected the donut will be crispy but it is not the case. The rice noodle that wraps around the dry donut is good, thin and smooth. It tastes so good together with the sesame sauce, hoisin sauce and a shake of white sesame. I will give a score of 9 out of 9.  Since the rice noodle is good. I places another order of rice noodle. Instead of wrapping around dry donuts, I ordered the rice noodle with shrimps. Similar to the dry donut wrapped with rice noodle, only the rice noodle tastes good, smooth and thin but the shrimps are way too salty. Score: 9/10  I think I will come back for congee and would like to try their fried noodles."}
{"text":"Place is clean, service is fast and friendly.  Congee portions are a good size and very delicious."}
{"text":"Cheap eats. Seriously.  Came here a few times for breakfast and ordered the usual congee, wonton noodles, fried dough fritter and rice rolls. Congee is decent in flavours but tends to be a bit on the watery side but other than that, the food is decent and prices are great.  The place is clean, brightly lit and not packed with tables. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Simple and to the point Chinese comfort food. Congee has good consistency and is loaded with ingredients, lamb is well marinated and the beef is nice and tender.   Pro tip: if you're going as a group and you all want soy milk, order the jug not individual glasses. You save a lot of money and the soy milk is home made :)"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Quick feedback based on my first visit:  - Very clean environment and seating is comfortable. - Service was quick and friendly. - Congee texture was smooth but tends to get on the watery side over time as you're eating it. - Lots of preserved eggs and tasted good. - Not much liver and the liver was a bit overcooked. - Fried dough stick was decent but a bit doughy. - Rice roll had quite a bit of filling but the rice roll layer could have been thinner and more elasticity. Also there was not much soy sauce on it. - Radish cake was large in quantity but texture was a bit dense. Not sure if it was mixed in with other ingredients that caused it.  Based on my overall experience, I will definitely go to Happy Congee instead of Original Congee."}
{"text":"Overall not bad. I will give 4 stars for service and the food. First impression, it is a clean and organized place. Servers were friendly and fast. They were able to maintain the same food quality when they opened in the foodcourt before.  The price is reasonable and big portion.   Congee is ok, deep fried items were fresh. I came here for the dough stick.  Only suggestion is for the turnip cake. They need to make improvement on this."}
{"text":"Very comfortable place and nice people here! Glad that they reopening now !!! I still love their plain steamed rice roll!! It was in the t&t food court before but now they have their own place!  Their service is good and quick!  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I always get take out from here for my kids to eat, straight after school. Their minced beef congee is the best. Everywhere else, just chops the beef slices up. This place really has minced beef. They also like the beef brisket rice noodles. They put the soup in a separate pot for take outs. The fried dough sticks are great too. Good food at great prices. The service is pretty good too and because I'm a regular, we always get another fried product for free."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm disappointed by this place at all. It's a simple spot with good rice rolls (which is what I came for)   I've tried the beef, shrimp, bbq pork, and fried doughnut rice rolls! I've also had the wonton soup -very flavourful wontons. I would note that they already prepour the soy sauce on your rice rolls which I love because they put enough on that's perfect for my preference. If you're someone who likes to control your sauce then maybe ask for it on the side?"}
{"text":"After having some SOLID food sitting in my stomach, I was looking for something to clear my soon to be digestion issues.  I walked in to the T&T food court at 11:30 am and the only stall opened was Original Congee which was great because that is what I came for.  I looked at the menu that includes a few COMBO items but what I really needed was Plain Congee($1.80) and Dough Stick($1.30).  The Congee was as advertised, plain flavour with good thick soupy consistency.  That and a very fresh deep-fried Dough Stick made me feel like what went in earlier will come right OUT.  :)  This is a GOOD option actually as the Congee isn't bad plus you don't have to pay tips or wait for a table and if you're like me you can just go eat on your own.  With all this in consideration, it's hard to compare to other places as an overall assessment.  Let's just say I'll come eat again then wait for Naniwa Taro to open up if ever.  BTW, the food court seats are fuckin' brutal.  The chairs are too short for the tables.  If you don't feel right, simply take the BAR style seating instead."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often for the congee and food.   Original congee is located at Middlefield and Steeles in the plaza. There are two congee places here, one in the food court, and this one. Some people might wonder, why in the world would someone choose to go to the congee in the restaurant over a congee in the food court? I actually think that Original Congee is slightly cheaper than the one in the food court and tastes a little better too.  There was once when I bought some congee for someone in the hospital and they were very accommodating with the levels of sodium and MSG that was placed in the congee.  I grab take out here quite often too, the chow mein come in a filled and packed small takeout container, the rice noodle is really soft here and wrapped around a crispy fried dough, it still tastes really delicious!"}
{"text":"first time here.  place seems fairly new.  very clean and modern.  friendly Food is very good."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted some rice noodles and this looked like it had good reviews!   Was a little disappointed in the fried dough rice noodle. Anything fried was cold and soggy. We came pretty early in the morning, like 8:30am, so it should be fresh?   It was soggy. We ordered a fried sweet donut (not sure what it's called), but it's usually really good when it's nice and fresh and hot.   Not so much here, it was cold and oily. :(  We ordered a congee since we got a combo, and the congee was pretty good! The prices are pretty cheap here, so can't complain too much. But I just wanted some fresh food! Not stale.   The servers were friendly.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times a long while back and the food was average. However, this time was um...not so good. After placing our order, I noticed one of the waitresses picking up a piece of paper that was on the floor. She placed it back onto a tray where it was used to line underneath the drinking cups. Omg!  Steamed Radish Cake was not so good... 2/5  Beef Rice Roll was gross! 1/5  - the 1 is only for the rice roll itself - the rice roll was not bad but the beef inside was so mushy like a beef paste!!   Beef Slice Lo Mein was ok 3/5 - they had to take back the bowl because they forgot to add the oyster sauce - it tasted ok since it's just mixed with oyster sauce but the look of the dish was not appetizing  Chicken & Preserved Egg Congee was not good 2/5 - you can definitely tell that they barely put any rice to make the congee as the thickness seemed to be like cornstarch  - the chicken was not bad  Dough Stick was ok 2.5/5 - you can taste the flour   All our dishes including the congee was served but we had to ask twice for our dough stick!! Don't think we'll be coming back...  We still like Sam's Congee Delight! Can't wait for their new location!"}
{"text":"Decent rice noodles, great brisket, good congee, fair price. Oh, and their playlist is a blend between 2000s pop, contemporary hits, mixed with some Chinese trends (G.E.M) and cantopop classics.   What We Got: beef brisket in noodle soup, combo #1 (minced beef congee and plain rice noodles) What I'd Get Next: same as above... Maybe the minced pork lo mein. MINCED BEEF CONGEE IS A CHAMPION. What I Wouldn't: come here on a weekend afternoon  Started off as a shop-in-a-supermarket (old T&T), and is now the shop next to the supermarket!  When it first opened, the owner - a very passionate lady - was always there, and this guaranteed amazing customer service. They've grown a lot since, and it's madness on weekend afternoons, with line ups waiting for seats! The downside is that the new servers aren't nearly as friendly (especially since it's so much busier), but the upside is that this means the food quality is still solid!  Brisket: tender and tasty! Rice Noodles: not so good. Can't unroll it to maximize the taste as it's mostly all wrinkly. I think it's the style but I'm not a fan Congee: boiling hot, well flavoured... And they're really generous on the meat portions. IT'S MY FAVOURITE BEEF CONGEE!  Environment: clean, simple, bright, busy. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Liked the assorted Congee as well as the fish Congee. Steamed radish cake was around 7/10. So used to the fried ones that the steamed one was not as good.   Meets expectations for a Congee place. The peanuts in the Congee is actually a wonderful combination. Congee from Congee Queen seemed to have a better aroma but then this place may be slightly less expensive.   I'd say it's worth a try if you like congee. We didn't try the noodles though. We were in the area so we tried it. Otherwise we'd still choose Congee Queen over this. Then again, it's just a personal taste and choice."}
{"text":"We went there on 11 February 2018 around 14:30.  It is a bit of a small place, and tables were quite close together, which is something I don't like.  I just don't enjoy eating and having a conversation with my husband when others are just centimetres  away.   Also the wait staff, even though consistent and efficient, they weren't very friendly.  Not a word seemed to come out of their mouths.  The prices are cheap, but also the quantity of the food matches the prices.  My husband had the Shrimp Steamed Rice Roll for $3.50 and I had the Preserved Egg and Shredded Pork Congee for $4.80.  My husband was pleased with his selection but did say it was rather small but for the price, the quantity was fine.  However, the Congee I had was bland and tasteless.   The pork wasn't shredded but sliced in strips and not tender at all.  I doubt we will go back but the Minced  Beef Congee with Plain Steamed Rice Roll does look a bit more appetizing."}
{"text":"Original Congee is a quiet, little place with very friendly employees and is definition of quick easy food done right. The food is nothing spectacular but is good when you don't have time to dine in and want something quick and filling (and when you get bored of getting McDonald's)"}
{"text":"We went to this area coz we want to try other restaurant but we decided went here coz they wasn't crowded and not a takeout place. We order congee for our lo and the cook was suggesting other type congee which is turns good. Our lo eat more than she used to. I'm ordering wonton noodle soup but i dont really like the smell of the noodle itself kinda have that rats pee(yuck) after few spoon. The chicken fried rice was good."}
{"text":"Updated review! Impressed because they fixed the sauce that I complained about. It's quite small and seats up to 10-15 parties but it has a bright and cozy ambience. Menu is quite simple and straightforward and service is good. The food came really quickly and freshly made when you order. Anything deep fried takes a bit of time because they fry it for you on the spot! Talk about freshness! Great for hangovers or when you're sick and need a little bit of comfort food that isn't greasy and loaded with calories.   What I ordered:   Red pudding congee: tbh I'm not a big fan of congee because of the texture but this one was actually okay. The texture wasn't too thick or too watery. The portion is quite big for like $4. Seasoning isn't too strong or too blend. They do have nuts in them so if you're allergic... make sure to speak up!   Fried tofu snack: it's always one of my go to favourites when at a congee place. Mainly because it's fried on the outside but the inside still remains the same texture as regular tofu. Portions also pretty good for about $2-3. THE SAUCE IS AMAZING! They fixed it after reading my review.  Soy-milk: I accidentally ordered a large... so for those of you who don't read properly... beware! Because this thing is the size of your head. You can definitely taste the soy in this milk and it has a small hint of natural sweetness to it from the soy."}
{"text":"This place is crazy during the morning. Their line was going in circles when I came here at 9ish on a Saturday. Most of the patrons purchase the fried dough. I love their fried dough, delicious, cheap and always fresh. The congee is nice and fluffy and minimal MSG. Rice noodles has a good silky texture and delicious. They also have other options like wonton noodles and beef brisket noodles, etc."}
{"text":"Their plain steamed rice roll is soft and smooth. Radish cake and fried rice roll is superb as well. Their congee is thicker than normal but some people prefer it that way"}
{"text":"Original Congee was \"originally\" inside the former T&T food court before T&T shut down.  They were our go to place to get our fix of fried dough crullers and congee and happy to say that they are as good as before.  Located outside the Field Fresh Supermarket its now a stand alone restaurant serving congee, rice and noodle dishes along with rice rolls, wontons and other typical dishes that one would find in a congee place.  Food is really good here but for us the stand out is the fried dough sticks and fried sweet cruellers (yau tiu and ngau lei so) along with the congee.   Dipping the deep fried cruellers into the smooth congee is an awesome combo;)  Service is very nice and food comes out quickly.  Overall a great place to grab some morning and afternoon grub."}
{"text":"My chopsticks had fur on it. Grossed out.   The fried crueler was yummy.   The congee was traditional. A little too salty for my taste.   Service was good. Waitress was friendly and attentive.   The plain steam noodle was a hit with the kids.   Spend $10, get a fried cruller for free."}
{"text":"The place is clean and service is friendly.   Food: Rice roll with fried dough - 1) portion is small, fried dough is not crispy and not fresh   Congee - overall the toppings portion is much less compare to Sam's. So the flavour is pretty lacking.   I may have high expectations on this place and it is just open. There are a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Another new congee place that open up this week.  The previous owner from T and T supermarket Food court owner decided to open his congee place after T and T Supermarket closed down last year. This restaurant is open beside Kim Bo Pho with its large yellow sign.   Congee is freshly made and well seasoned. These guys don't skip on ingredient like the one inside the field fresh supermarket food court. Where they put a lot of congee ($3.80- $4.70)    You Tiao aka (Chinese Fried Dough) freshly made but a bit smaller in size and more crunchy. The owner is still perfecting his skill after being away from this craft for a year. ($1.30)  They have variety of soup noodle such as Lamb, Beef Brisket, Wanton noodles. Well priced ($5.00 -$7.50)and freshly made on the spot.   Also have steam rice roll ranging from plain, shrimp,beef, bbq pork and more ($2.60-$4.50)  Go check these guys out if you are craving some Chinese style breakfast on a cold winter morning. They open 7am every morning. Good value, fresh food, and clean location."}
{"text":"Original Congee has reopen in this new location after one year of closing down their Food Court location.  3.5  A real restaurant with table service. Bigger portion than before and with similar price! Their Combo still starts at $5.50!  Congee of course is the most popular things to order here. And I love their steamed rice rolls! And if you are not into any of those, they have beef brisket or wonton noodles too! Their Wonton Noodle Combo at $6.50 that includes a side vegetables is just hard to beat if you into value!  Opens at 7 am! This maybe the place to go for early authentic Chinese breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab congee on a Saturday morning and my dad suggested that we try Original Congee since he's been a big fan of them from when they were located inside of the T&T supermarket next door.   Went around 10am and there weren't many people in the restaurant so we were served immediately with hot water and menus with a piece of paper for ordering purposes. It is a small little restaurant that fits around 30 people at most and playing on the speakers were mellow chinese songs.   We decided to order a mix of congee bowls, stir fried noodles, and noodle soup. They had a promotion going on where you received a free order of fried breadstick before 11am so that was added onto our order as well. Our orders came in around 5 minutes; so quick and the staff were very attentive. They gave us extra bowls in order for us to share and did so without us asking. For the service, I give them 5/5.   The congee itself was creamy and came in a heaping portion. Each congee bowl comes with lettuce and peanuts. The stir fried noodles are typical of what you would expect and the shrimp wonton noodle soup we ordered was also a fair size. The prices were very fair and in my opinion, quite inexpensive for what you were getting. We left with a happy and full belly.  Overall, I found no reason to dock a star from Original Congee. The atmosphere was small and quaint, the food was as expected and prices were very fair, and the staff were very attentive and well mannered. Definitely a new favourite of mine and will be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this place for congee, fresh rice rolls, and fried Chinese breakfast items.  Everything is made fresh right there and you can even watch them make it behind the glass.  Coming from a family that likes to cook and make food ourselves, the fact that my whole family will come here for breakfast or brunch on a weekend tells you how good they are.  Even people from Hong Kong or Asia who come here are impressed by how clean and fresh and yummy it is here.  Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Busy congee restaurant but don't seem overly impressed. The restaurant isn't too big so if you go there during peak times you might need to wait which might be ok if the food is that great.  Ordered two congee: thousand years old egg and pork, & chicken and fish congee. In addition, ordered 3 steam rice rolls: deep fried dough, shrimp, & chicken mushroom. And finally order their fresh ground soya milk.   The congee, definitely they don't over salt it which is good. The thousand year old egg and pork had a decent amount of ingredients but the chicken and fish one was lacking ingredients. Flavour wise it seems a little different from the other places I have been to.   The steam rice rolls, similar to the congee it seems a little skimpy on ingredients too. The rice rolls also aren't as soft as some of the other places I have been to either.   Their fresh soya milk although it is fresh but also seems a little water down. I could do with a little more bean taste.   Would I go back? Not so sure."}
