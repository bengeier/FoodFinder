{"text":"The pizza was good and I love the concept of making your own, however this location was filthy and service not so great.  It's a Saturday night and pretty dead compared to other places in the area.  There's 7 employees working and all of them are standing behind the counter not working. What's annoying is that there's not a clean table in the whole place, food all over the floor, etc.  One employee is on his phone texting and one is at the register dancing. What the hell?   It doesn't look like there's a manager on shift. What's sad is that they have a sign saying they're hiring, yet clearly over staffed with kids that aren't working.  I don't know that we'll go back.  If the place is that poorly run and dirty in the dining area, hate to know what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Disrespectful employees. I thought the African American dude who works there was disabled or deaf and kept repeating everything I said till the tall  girl behind the cash starts laughing with him & acts  sarcastic while I was there for the pizza only. Will never eat there again. The business owner better interview his employees first before hiring people who are disrespectful to customers. I'm very disappointed. Unprofessional and uneducated people."}
{"text":"Wow, crazy good pizza! I loved the pizza place that was here before but this place is wwwaayy better. Great service, great pizza, great salads and all in your control to make your own perfect pizza or salad."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price!  Cannot beat this for the money!  Crust is delicious and toppings are fresh.  I have a family of four and this fits great within the budget!  Perfect for a family of picky eaters.  Everyone gets exactly what they want and how they want it!"}
{"text":"Very disappoint in this place yet again. 3rd time is always a charm. I waited in line for 15 minutes to get up front and find out that they are out of Gluten Free dough yet again. I use to go there 2-3 times a week and the staff was friendly, fast and knew your name and order. There is a whole new group and they are slow. Pizzas lined up on the counter and only 2 of them in the oven baking. Will not be going back as I don't have time to sit and wait and then have to go and find something else to eat."}
{"text":"awesome pizza!  such a simple concept and it works! the Hawaiian BBQ is the best I have ever had!  you have to get the cookie dessert!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Pizza is excellent and is top notch. I feel the great vibes from great people. I highly recommend this place. Ask for charmanine!"}
{"text":"Think of this place like a sandwich shop... 1 pizza size (11 inches), you move down the line and select you toppings. You can select unlimited toppings however they suggest 6 or less. They have some speciality suggestions or you can make your own. Since it was my first time, I got the #5, it was a steak and gorgonzola pizza. It also has mushrooms , onions and peppers,  but I'm not a pepper fan, so I took those off. The staff was really nice it only took 5 minutes to actually bake the pizza. They are getting 3 stars because the bottom of the pizza was burned and that's gross to me. I'll give them another shot but if it's burned again I probably won't come back"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the quality  and freshness of the ingredients. Pizza was surprisingly delicious. My girlfriend loves that they offer fresh mozzarella and spicy sausage. I was impressed by their overall customer service and friendliness. We've been here twice in the past week, and each time our pizza was great. Customizing your own pizza for one low price of $7.75 is unheard of, especially given the quality. I Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza. Try it out and don't be shy to add multiple toppings, it's only $7.75 regardless of how many toppings you choose."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I frequent this location often and usually but our experience today was bad. It's unprofessional and rude for a manager to yell at and reprimand an employee in front of customers; especially for a pizza having too many toppings. The last time we checked, the menu allowed for an unlimited amount of toppings. To Jay, one of our favorite employees, you're doing a great job! Thanks for always greeting us with a smile."}
{"text":"The place is on the south side of the outlets. I was soooo glad that they opened up in the west valley because I used to have to go all the way downtown for Fired Pie. It's a \"build your own personal pizza/salad\" type of place so there are a lot of combinations to choose from.  Pizza is very thin with a crunchy crust."}
{"text":"So I meant to write a review for these guys.... I came in the first time last week and got the steak and blue in their recommendation. It was amazing. And even better was the Customer service.  These guy's were friendly and made it a fun experience. I can remember their names. It was the two guys at night. They say they check this every day so great job guys"}
{"text":"Always great service, fast and great tasting. Can't beat a personal pizza for the price and size. Location is very clean and always picked up also."}
{"text":"The pizza is fresh and delicious!! The ordering is easy and fast. You can put as many toppings as you like, with no extra charge! Today was our first time at Fired Pie, and we will be back before the next sporting event we attend in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love love love it! So Delicious and for the price you can't beat it. The quality of the toppings are amazingly delicious! Order 3 nights in a row haha and love the pizza each time!! Yummy"}
{"text":"The Agua Fria Plaza needed a place like Fired Pie!    Basically, you choose from a very wide selection of sauces, cheese, toppings, and spices for your pizza, all for $7.95 for a 12\" pie.  Plenty for one person.  You really cant get that anywhere else.  At least anywhere I've been, it is extra per topping which adds up.   If you dont feel like being creative that day, you can choose from several combinations that they've put together for you, such as an all meat one or all veggie one.  They also can do salads too, where you just pick your toppings.  Awesome!  An added bonus, they also have a pizza cookie available for dessert.  Yum!  The only thing is, you kind of have to eat it there.  It tastes best fresh out of the oven.  Boxed up to be consumed at a later time isnt the best, so make sure you have the time to eat it there.  Also, they have alcohol there and serve very tasty Bellini's."}
{"text":"Decided to go here before a concert, wasn't sure what to expect. It was a Friday night and I was surprised to see only a fee people in there but was so happy to see that it wasn't packed. The place was very clean and had graffiti art on the walls while music was playing. You walk up to where you order your pizza and the place is like a subway/chipotle; you tell them what to put on it and see what they put on your pizza. Thought this was cool. They brought our pizzas to us and I thought it tasted good I just wasn't a fan of the bunt edges but that's the draw back from having it cooked open flamed. The pookie ice cream/ cookie was very good; caution it's served in a very hot bowl lol learned that after touching it. Thought the lady should have told me this when she brought it to us. I would good here again because you can't beat the price! Also my husband was glad they serve alcohol lol"}
{"text":"Really like the concept but they sure skimp on the toppings if you get anything other then red sauce and mozzarella. I'll add a pic of my pizza that had large bubbles in it do to the lack of toppings."}
{"text":"Staff not the friendliest at lunch. I felt awkward when asking for tomatoes on margherita pizza. Asked for a side of balsamic vinegar and was dismissed, when I asked again it was like I was a bother. Found stringy pieces of plastic (looked like really thick clear hair) between the crust and sauce. The experience was just strange."}
{"text":"Fast, customizable, super affordable, filling, delicious pizzas. Can we get one in Utah already?"}
{"text":"We go here once a week because it's just way too good and affordable! Don't let the fact that it's in an outlet fool you, this place is legit. So many toppings and nice crispy crust. We've tried other custom pizza places but this one beats them all. I also recommend the southwest chicken salad!"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is awesome! I work nearby. After hearing all my co-workers raving about this place, I gave it a try. For $7.75 + tax you can get *ANY* pizza. You can buy one of their pre-made pizzas, or create your own. No extra charges for ANYTHING.  They really mean it when they say create your pizza. Sauces include tomato, bbq, pesto, alfredo and more.  On my last pizza, I asked for mozerella AND fresh mozerella. I asked for the oil and garlic over the cheese (before the toppings). The meat went on next (pepperoni, bacon, sausage) following by the vegies (roast peppers, fresh red onion, roast mushrooms, pepperoncini, heavy garlic). When the pizza came out of the oven, the chopped basil went on.  I asked for a side of sauce to go with it. The guy suggested ranch, but I went for tomato sauce.  The crust was crisp but soft. The topping were fresh and tasty. VERY fast and very reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!  I'm sure others have said it, but it's like the Chipotle of pizza with a more refined finished product.  High quality pizza/ingredients.  Finished product is restaurant level quality with take out pricing.  It's fun to bring people to and they have a couple beers and wines available.  I have eaten here and ordered to go.  Dine-in was fine, not a place you would hang out for 2 hours because of the number of people coming in and out, but it's not a bad experience either.  The to-go was quick, easy, and traveled well.  Recommend for a quick meal  when you're tired of whole foods' burgers and Chipotle's burritos.  Wife just reminded me to add:  Salads are great too!"}
{"text":"Great food, it's our go to place for our Friday nights. But I gotta say, we would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the shitty customer service. It's feels like we are bothering the pizza makers when we are ordering. They roll their eyes, no smiles and they hardly look up at you while your ordering. It's a shame, it makes us not want to come."}
{"text":"I was about to ask for pineapples as a pizza topping, but there was this nasty fly on top of them. I know the girl saw it, but she pretended not to. I actually almost walked out of there thinking it had been roaming around all the other toppings as well. I only ordered the pepperoni topping though 'cause I did not want to risk it. I was there about 2 weeks ago, but I won't be going back. Also they do add very little sauce to their pizzas."}
{"text":"$10 bucks gets you any pizza you create and a drink. Not a bad deal. Be creative on your choices. Get pesto with the marinara, then load up on capicola and spicy Italian sausage. Or no sauce with extra garlic and anchovies. Good food. Try a Bellini, tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to so many places similar to fired pie and I thought that I enjoyed those... But honestly those places were just the warm up to this. This was some of the best pizza I've ever had. I love thin crust and I was able to eat the majority of the thing on my own. It was so delicious! I would highly recommend to anyone. Even my boyfriend loved it and he's a bit of a pizza snob. The only thing that I wish they offered was a whole wheat crust like other build your own pizza studios."}
{"text":"It's like going to Chipotle or Subway but for pizza. With that said, it's hard to have a bad pizza because you get to choose what's on it, all at the same price. I like that because I like going mad wild on the toppings and not having to think about how much extra that's gunna cost me.   The pizza was pretty good quality wise, everything looked and tasted pretty good. Don't expect top notch gourmet pizzas here, something about the pizzas remind me of Pizza Hut to be honest. But for the price and convince of making a super good pizza for myself, I'll take it.   Didn't have to wait long at all for the pizza to cook, they aren't that big so they cook quick and definitely filling for lunch.   I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it just fell short.   As other people have described, it's basically made to order wood fired personal pizzas. For my pizza, I got tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, capicola, tomatoes, and basil.   The overall taste was just underwhelming. The sauce and the pizza dough were under seasoned and the ingredients were just not that fresh or of high quality. If you're going to have a personalized pizza business like this where you can add a variety of toppings, the owner/chefs should work on perfecting the sauces and the dough so that the pizza has a good base of flavors. I doubt I will go here again. You're better off going south to Phoenix and getting some pizza from Nook or Pizzeria Bianco.   I'm only giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Yummilicious! So many fresh ingredients to chose from. Liked it so much I went back the next day....Salads are great too! Great idea!"}
{"text":"So good! Can't go wrong with Fired Pie. Ingredients are always fresh with plenty of options. I really like their gluten free crust.  I've always had great service."}
{"text":"I went here because my boyfriends best friend works here, I was a bit skeptical because I'm typical not a fan of assembly line restaurants. It was amazing! We got the spicy southwest salad and veggie pizza. The salad was spicy, fresh and hearty. The veggie pizza was very tasty. And the service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I enjoyed both times. The first time, there was no line. I went for dinner because a student group was doing a fundraiser. The second time, today, was for lunch. There was a bit of a line and I thought it was going to go slowly but it actually moved along well.  I really like the pizza crust at this place. It's better than MOD Pizza. It's thin crust. Only one size (11\"). They seem like they are pretty skimpy with the red sauce but when you get the pizza, it's actually just right.  The employees were friendly both times. I got everything I wanted. It only took about 5 minutes from paying the bill to getting both of the pizzas we ordered.  The atmosphere of the dining room is comfortable. Typical for this kind of place. They have a small patio if you're interested in sitting outside (which isn't very often in Arizona).  Plenty of parking.  It's about $13 for a pizza and a drink.  I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place- the pizzas are great! Love that they have fresh mozzarella. Inexpensive and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price here. Its kinda of like a subway if subway had good food, and made pizza instead of sandwiches.   You pick your size then toppings and they fire cook it. Always comes out really great (for the price). I just think its the best pizza money can but under $10.   Throw in some draft beers and amazing ice cream shakes and its a winner in my book."}
{"text":"The staff treated my order like an inconvenience to them. They were not very friendly or welcoming. My pizza was burned to a blackened crisp and they still delivered it to me. And their light fixtures are so low that two customers hit their heads when standing up from their tables just while I was there. No one from staff came to check on them. The restaurant is subpar and even unsafe."}
{"text":"Party in your mouth goodness! Quick, yummy and nearby...best combo ever!  Great find!"}
{"text":"Great meal, quality ingredients in a custom, hand-tossed pie. Nice service and friendly, Helpful staff. The Hawaiian BBQ chicken pie I ordered was delicious, and there was plenty to share and take home."}
{"text":"Really good!  I'm a picky eater, so getting to pick out exactly what will be on my pizza is amazing!  I wish they had bigger pizzas for family style dining."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is awesome! Pizza is amazing! They let you create your own pizza for one single price of $7.95. I would recommend trying the Hawaiin - easy sauce, it is amazing.  All of the pizzas are made fresh right in front of you. You would think it would take a long time to cook but the pizza is cooked and ready to eat in about 5 minutes, that is just incredible! I have been going to this place for a few months and just love it. The pizza is consistent and I have not been disappointed yet. If you are a pizza enthusiast as myself, I think you will love this place. I would give this joint an extra star if I could, it is that good!  Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and salads are delicious and very reasonably-priced..went to both Chandler and Ahwatukee sites."}
{"text":"I just can't get over the fact that you can build a pizza with anything on it for 7.95! As many meats, veggies, cheeses as you want. Just a great overall concept. Subway but for pizzas."}
{"text":"Let me start out with food quality. The food is really good. I've been here before and the food has always been good. The customer service was terrible. I felt like it was an inconvenience for me to come in. The guy helping me didn't seem like he wanted to be there at all. He seemed like he just didn't care at all. His customer service was terrible. The girl working the register was really nice and was courteous when she brought out my food. So food gets 5 stars customer service cause of that guy gets 1 star. Don't know if I really want to come back to a place that doesn't seem to want my business"}
{"text":"The dough it fresh and crispy! The only reason I didn't give 5 out of 5 is because they don't have truffle oil or ricotta cheese as options."}
{"text":"We've gone to Fired Pie Chandler about 10 times and their pizza always has great crust and fresh ingredients. We love that you can get any amount of the large selection of toppings that you'd like. The pizza comes to your table within just a few minutes.  My favorite is the tomato sauce with mozzarella, parmesan and a bit of the fresh mozzarella too. Then top it with pepperoni, fresh mushrooms and regular sausage.   All you can drink beverages include a terrific tasting fresh lemonade, fresh tea and the standard soda fare.  Save room for a Fired Pookie for dessert. Mmmm... A chocolate chip cookie, cooked in a little pizza pan until it's slightly crunchy/ chewy on the outside and a warm gooey goodness on the inside. Comes with a little bit ice cream on top."}
{"text":"Subway of pizza, not good. This must be one of those places that pays for reviews because the pizza and ingredients were shit."}
{"text":"I was on my way home and I needed to get something to eat. I like fired pie and saw the lights on so I went in. I walked in at 9:26, 4 minutes before closing time, and the employees still greeted me with a smile, joked with me and made me an awesome pizza! One of the reasons why I love this fired pie!"}
{"text":"Listing says free wifi, and that they have a network that shows with good strength, they say they don't have wifi and no password. Wouldn't have come here to get some work done if I would have known.   Pizza was good so 2 stars"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm addicted.      This place is unreal.....and unlimited toppings!!! What!?   I told them that if they go bankrupt then I won't be able to go there anymore....so believe it or not in my own interest I told them to increase their prices....need I say more...?"}
{"text":"This is a good, fast pizza joint where you can order pizzas per person and however you want for basically one price. There's only one type of crust (thin) but it's pretty good.   I ate one here and ordered one to go for my late night drunkardness!   I would return in the future if I wanted a quick mini pizza."}
{"text":"First off let me tell tou this was my first rtme here, i have been hearing all this chatter about itfrom everyone. YyFrom the get go i was asked what i would like and then the sauce and cheese. This was the difficult part as i was trying to choose the gentlemen helping me seemed to be preoccupied with the women i could only assume was the manager. It took awhile as they were both laughing at whatever they were discussing, at first i thought it was ok, people talk right, but then i stand and wait for my meats..of course until she was done joking with the boy next to her! and all she does it stare at me without asking anything, eventually i just started naming my toppings. I understand you want to have fun at work but there is a time and place. I figured the manager would have acted a little more professional in the situation. On the plus side food was actually great.."}
{"text":"Exciting new choice in the neighborhood. Very good food. Excellent service. Very reasonably priced. Definitely a notch above Mod."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times. Service has varied. Sometimes it's really good and they move quickly making a perfect pizza. Other times its been slow and my pizza came out with all the toppings clumped together. Over all its been more positive than not and the food is always a great deal for the price. Customise to your own tastes. I recently tried a take on a mufaletta:  -garlic and oil -mozzarella and fontina -ham, salami and capicola -red onions and banana peppers -sweet balsamic dressing  Came out really nicely."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing but the service was terrible!  We were here on a Sunday around 2 pm and the young ladies working behind the counter were anything but friendly.  They all looked like they were on drugs, they barely smiled, they didn't explain anything to us even after we shared this was our first time, and numerous people complained about the service while we ate.  Even though the food was great, we will not be back because of the employees."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. We have been going here quite awhile. I know  this style of pizza restaurant is popping up all over now like Mod-Pie,etc but this one remains our favorite. The staff is always great and the service is fast. I think this is one of the better pizza crusts and they cook them perfectly each time. we have eaten here many times and it has always been excellent."}
{"text":"My kids all loved the pizzas. There were plenty of regular and gluten-free options. My steak and blue cheese salad was barely edible. It seemed like the steak needed to be heated up. It was shredded and hard to bite through. The toppings all would have been good on a pizza but cold on a salad was gross. The servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Visited two times now! Just what this area needed. Both times greeted by friendly staff. The pizza is really tasty and has lots of flavor! You create the pizza of your liking and it's made in adequate time. Prices are very responsible. Salad is also pretty good. Diffantly worth a try."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good..However, it is a new location and I understand it's a learning process for new employees.. We walked in exactly when it seemed like the manager was leaving. From there we got on the line and there was at least 7 employees standing there chit chatting away and walking back and forth while there was one girl trying to take our order with a line piling up behind us.. I bought 2 bottles of water and the girl didn't give them to me so my fiancé went up and asked for them, another girl said oh yeah sure and handed us 2 water cups, we said no we paid for water bottles.. Then she hands us ONE water bottle. It's like Come on now! The employees just kind of didn't seem like they knew what they were doing. I know it's a new location, but it should be managements responsibility that there is someone there who does actually know what they are doing. I'll probably stick to Pieology!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place based on word of mouth and the reviews, and I'm so glad I did. I wish I remembered the girls name who helped me as soon as I walked in to explain the concept. She was great and I needed that!    I went with a pizza, half of their steak specialty and half of my own creation. The ingredients were fresh, there's plenty of options, thin crust is delicious and perfectly cooked, plus the service was friendly and quick. Can't go wrong for less than $9 no matter how many toppings."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC experience!!!!!! Delic thin crust custom pizza....for 7.75.....pile on the toppings and the crust is still crisp and the price is still 7.75. The salads are fresh and fantastic too. Service was outstanding-fast, friendly and helpful. I will be going back every time I want pizza----which is very often :) finally a great pizza place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I work at a pizza place and don't tend to eat much of it but this place is worth going too! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thought we would check this out, when we walked in our ears were assaulted by music that was not the best for a dining experience, not sure what they are going for, but they missed out on our business"}
{"text":"Do it. Decently priced. Unlimited toppings. And the kids at this location are so helpful and friendly! However, be prepared to wait in line...this location has gotten super busy in recent months."}
{"text":"We really love this place. Staff is friendly and each person can get their own personal pizza. They have a lot of choices for sauce, cheese and toppings and also have a \"mostly\" gluten free option (can't guarantee it since it all goes into the same oven). I know they do a lot of lunch business given all the offices around the area but we have only been for dinner and there is never much of a wait. The kids love to get the cookie dessert. We will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. My first reaction: slop. Staff are great but my pizza (steak & blue) was inedible and flavorless. I tried it when I got in the car (still hot/\"fresh\") -- I nibbled the crust off 2 pieces, pitched it along with my lil' salad, and got food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried tonight for the first time.   The food was good, not great.   The problem that I had was with the service.  They were terrible.   My husband got his pizza before me and had finished before I got mine.....which was the wrong one.  After waiting for another 15 minutes (after reordering my pie) got my pizza.  Of course took my to go.    I will not be coming back....very disappointed after so many people telling me to try it."}
{"text":"Love this pizza and that there is a gluten free option. They are nice and thin, one person pizzas and perfect for sharing with someone else. Place is a little small inside but has some outside seating in cooler weather. We like to order for takeout and enjoy at home. Too bad they don't deliver!"}
{"text":"Ok... here it goes. I give it two for the fact that when they make a pie correctly, it is a good pie at a good value.   If you are unlucky enough to get the kids (most of them that work there are) that have an attitude like you are interrupting their day so they have to work, then I feel for you.   You will get a pizza with a ton of sauce/pesto in the center (along with the rest of the toppings) and nothing but crisp dough on the outer three inches. It's more like a cracker that a pizza. And if you ask them to spread out the toppings, you get nothing but attitude.  I used to work in a pizzeria in high school. I learned the art of making a great pie. It's done by spreading the ingredients evenly (including the sauces), to the edges so each bite is what you came for in the first place. Not all the ingredients piled in the center and cold in the middle.  And how about you get rid of the kid that won't even look at you (or the pizza) when making the pie? If he can't make pizzas then maybe he can sweep floors instead? What a horrible example of customer engagement. Sorry kid, you actually have to work to get paid.  Please, please, please will the management do something about the training? Making a pizza well takes some work, but it isn't rocket science."}
{"text":"This place is right below where I work, I work at the Bank of America tower down town and I was craving some pizza. Been to this place before and it was awesome but sad to say that my experience today was horrible. I believe there must have been an event downtown because there was lots of people everywhere and there was a long line. I didn't mind the line because I really wanted pizza. So it is finally my turn to order and I tell them what I would like it was done. I had already been in the location for about 20-25 min just waiting and I only get a 30 min lunch. So while I was standing waiting for my pizza it appears as through when MY pizza is taken out it is burnt, so I see the worker that is cutting the slices, actually try and cut off the BURNT edges. Then I guess the manager noticed I was watching her because he told her something that I wasn't able to make out but I did hear him say, \"SHE IS WATCHING\", which I absolutely was because I was waiting. It then seems like they are about to make me a WHOLE NEW PIZZA and although I was right there no one mentions anything to me.  I then ask her how much longer is it going to take and she says maybe four more minutes.  So I stand there and wait because what other choice do I have I already paid.  Then I hear the manager tell her \"People act like we do this SHIT on purpose\"  Mind you NO ONE HAS YET TO TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR APPOLIGIZE. A simply \"I am sorry\" would have gone such a long way, needless to say I got stuck eating my pizza at my desk while working.  The pizza is good I will give them that but the customer service can definitely use some work. Next time I will walk to city scape to get a pizza, they have another spot just like it over there!!"}
{"text":"Updating review: THEY NOW HAVE VEGAN CHEESE !!! Regular crust and red sauce are also vegan too....Lots of veggie options as well....It actually was pretty good too. Can now definitely eat here with the family !!! Staff were pretty cool here too.....a homeless guy came in for food and the guy working today was really good with him and treated him like a human being.....it was good to see, I wish more establishments in the area did the same ! Not sure what the dudes name was but he definitely was a good guy...good hearted dude !!!"}
{"text":"This is priced so perfectly. If your company is on a budget. This place is budget friendly. Not only is the pizza good but so is the customer service.  Gluten free pizza?  Its the only way to eat pizza, well, at least for me it is."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and they are quick too.  My favorite is all meat with veggies.  Nice to run in pick up and eat real fast so I can get back to working on my customers cars.  Customer service is amazing too.  I have never had any issues with this little pizza joint"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good and comparable to the \"other guys\" down the road. However, time and time again I am disappointed in the service and lack of professionalism shown at this location. I work at the Collier Center and this location is just a few steps outside my building, so it is convenient for me to satisfy my craving for pizza here. I came by here today, the place was pretty much empty, and it appeared as if the place was at full staff. It took nearly my entire 30 min lunch break for me to place my order and get my pizza. This is totally unacceptable, the  workers were, for the most part, standing around, doing nothing. This does not happen when I order from the other guys down the road, usually I can be In and out in 15 minutes or less. If this location wants to survive in a very competitive downtown area, it must do better, because I can, and will take my business elsewhere, regardless of the convenience of this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This is the second time I've been here and both times my pizza was way over crust. Even though it's a thin crust it shouldn't be black and charred tasting. I couldn't even taste the toppings. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!!!  I am really glad I discovered this place and that it's so close to work.  I ordered two pizzas...one which I invented myself and the other for my friend/co-worker...the steak and blue.  We devoured those things...except for the two slices we offered our boss.  We all agreed...those pizzas were awesome.  In fact, my boss picked up two pizzas at the Agua Fria location on the way home that evening!!!  And you can't beat the price!!!  Definitely a keeper for my weekday lunch choice."}
{"text":"I've ordered several times from here and never had a problem but tonight I did. I ordered a tomato basil pizza, veggie pizza and a naked caesar salad. When I opened the box, the tomato basil had no basil, the veggie pizza was burnt and the caesar salad had no croutons. To top it off both pies weren't even cut properly. You guys need to train your staff and have them learn the menu before they serve customers!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! Fired Pie reminds me of Chipotle, yet the Pizza and Salad version. Put on whatever toppings you want, and the price stays the same. They even have delicious combinations they've already created which are delicious!  Awesome place, good food, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizzas are the perfect size and the crust is tasty. I recommend the buffalo chicken pizza with bacon and the Nutella sweet bite."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad. If you like thin crust pizza and fast service this is the place to go. Build your own with about every ingredient you could possibly want."}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious, with friendly service too!  I will be telling all of our local friends and neighbors to come here instead of Rays and NYPD that are just around the corner.  What a great deal if you like getting lots of toppings since you can add whatever you want. We will be back very soon!    Fired Pie, welcome to the area!"}
{"text":"Waited for like 15mins because they messed up my order! They gave me a pizza with someone else's name and saying it's mine after I asked for my order. They didn't even say sorry!"}
{"text":"Stopped here in way to airport & is convenient to Talking Sticks Arena. Their gluten free herb crust is excellent. The variety of sauces, meats & veggie toppings are quite good. I appreciate that they have fresh mozzarella available because I think it makes a better pizza (more like homemade). My husband used shredded & fresh on his pizza because he likes extra cheese. My son had a regular crust pizza & it looked chewy & crisp - the way a \"real\" pizza should be. The pizzas come out quickly. They also offered salads that looked good. They also came with lots of options, but we weren't hungry enough to try. The best part of Fired Pie is the price. I don't know of any place in San Diego where we live where you can get a wood fired pizza with toppings for $8. Yes, there is an extra charge for GF, but that's everywhere. We'll be back next year during our annual Spring Training trip."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here and at a great price.  There are other venues that have the same concept but Fired Pie is above the rest.  They have sauteed veggies instead of raw, tons of different topping choices.  Although, I personally don't like loading up my Pizza as it makes it soggy and too heavy for the crust.  Great flavor and service there as well.  Only problem I would have is the parking at this location is sometimes a challenge."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I don't really have much to complain about. Their pizza is delicious and it's a definite plus that you can pick out all your own toppings!   Only reason I gave four stars is because the service here is hit or miss. The last time I went in the workers just seemed indifferent or that they didn't want to be there... Seemed like they were just doing their jobs like robots. Plus every time I go in the tables are dirty and sometimes it's hard to find somewhere to sit.   Other than that, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Since going Gluten Free from having Celiacs disease, it's been difficult finding a better than average gluten free pizza.  No longer is that the case.  Not sure exactly what Pizza Me does differently with their Gluten Free crust but it's significantly better than anyone else I have found.    In the last 2 weeks I have been back 3 times.  The Pesto Chicken pizza is amazing.    Also very reasonably priced and they cook they prepare the food quickly for your convenience.  Wish all places were like this."}
{"text":"We took the family here and loved the fact that we could all order what we wanted! The pizza was very good, service was fast and restaurant was clean. Simple and easy!"}
{"text":"First time here and must say that I love it...created my own pizza, any topping and turned out really good"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  Not a large selection, only pizza and salad.  My wife and I really enjoy the pizza, each as we like it.  That is the good news.  The bad is this place is really dirty and the staff doesn't seem to care.  There was food on the seating surfaces, food on the floor, every table in the restaurant was dirty even though only a few were in use.  The sun beat through the large west facing windows making it difficult to see in certain directions while the windows were equipped with shades, no one bothered to lower them, so the few patrons were crammed into the few shady tables.  All this while the staff stood around talking with each other.  There were no utensils available and when we asked, we were told an employee was sent to wash two forks.  The food preparers wore gloves which was good but had long, loose hair which they were constantly brushing out of their eyes.  All in all, a really poor performance by an unsupervised, uncaring staff of teenagers badly in need of training.  This place really needs a health inspector."}
{"text":"They keep the pizza spatula behind the garbage can on the ground.  I e-mailed corporate about it and they claimed to be appalled but the practice continues from what I hear from others.  I will not eat here."}
{"text":"Surprising place to have a GOOD pizza but I have to say I'm super impressed with this place. They have a GF pizza as well!"}
{"text":"I walked in to fired pie at 8:00 pm and there was two girls and a guy in front of me that had maybe arrived 30 seconds before myself and they where maybe fourteen to sixteen years old and the three workers at the glass where so enthralled in them that they never even bothered to even say one thing to me or the other customers that had walked in as we stood there for at least seven minutes in a empty store with employees standing around with there hands on there face board or in there  pockets which I no is a no no when it comes to having a food handlers card. I even looked at the girls several times that where standing there, one with her hands in her pockets nothing. The other girl by the oven was bent over with her hands on her face looking board as hell. She kept looking at me but nothing. Everyone was more interested in the horseplay of the young kids ordering there pizzas so after taking  7+ minutes of this I said fk it and left know one said nothing to me as I left also. I happened to notice that them other people behind me also left so this wasn't just myself feeling this. The Moral of this is no welcome, No conversation while waiting it does not take three women to make one pizza in que because they cared more about the conversation with there friends than the actual customers that stood there for like  7-10 minutes . This comes down to the lack of a manager or shift (adult) at night when you have a store full of teens working with no guidance from and adult or and authority figure at all you will get horseplay and a lack of guidance. I was extremely hungry from working 13 hours that day and I ended up leaving with nothing. I have been to this location 25+ times since there opening and this will officially be my last. Standing there and all the employees making you feel as if they don't want you there or care because your not some 15 year old kid says a lot to me."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  And the pizza was delicious!   I chose the pesto sauce with chicken, grilled onions, fresh mozzarella, spinach & artichokes.  The crust was perfect and very light too.  I will be back to visit."}
{"text":"If you would of looked into the future and told me my experience here was going to go how it did, I wouldn't of believed you.  It was clean, open and visually appealing.  Reminded me of chipotle interior.  There was no line and a woman and her son before me ordering 2 pizzas.  About ten minutes later the nice gentleman helping us out(on his own) apologized for the wait, as a line began to form behind me.  I started to get confused why there was only one person helping customers while I could see 3 other employees having a conversation a few feet behind him.  These things happen, maybe they were on break.  After I finished ordering I paid about 8.50 for my pizza and sat down.  Ten more minutes later the original employee who helped me walked pizzas over to some customers.  Hand delivered service, I like it.  :)  About five minutes after that I heard someone call my name.  I guess that meant my pizza was ready!  I went and grabbed it.  Haven't eaten since breakfast I was ready to eat.  On, a side note, I was confused by the inconsistency of why one customer got their food brought to them and I didn't, but I didn't mind the walk.    So I sat down and was ready to enjoy this amazing custom made pizza of my design.  I first noticed the crusts were black, but I wasn't quick to assume the worst, that it was burnt.  I looked at the bottom of the first piece and it was about 80 percent black.  I thought maybe that because of the way it's cooked that's just how they looked.  I ate the first piece, I was pretty overwhelmed by the taste of char but I was pretty hungry.  As it turns out, I couldn't make it though the second piece.  All I could taste was char and the crusts pretty much crumbled into a fine pile of black.  Perhaps this is an acquired taste but I couldn't do it.  I considered requesting having the pizza remade, but I had lost my appetite by this point."}
{"text":"I love the concept. Based on my gemba I'm sure they could boost productivity and quality if they had just a little more space there to work in and reduced muda by timing the pizzas so they didn't have to make new pies, which costs time and resources, could 5S the ingredients so whatever is used most frequently is ... Ah, right. The pizza. Yeah, that's where it falls down a bit. It's the salt content. The pizzas were really salty. You can always add more but you can't take away. But the rest of it was a home run: crispy cracker crust, toppings were flavorful, time was fast except for the three pies in front of me they had to remake coz they got burnt. I would've eaten them, I like it a bit more charred, adds flavor. I actually like the concept a lot. It's the little things now they have to work on to make this an exportable success."}
{"text":"This is a review for those that need food catered. The catering manager was very friendly and helped me get the order together quickly, that was great! Delivery was on time and delivery employee was helpful with setup. Pizza was good , I ordered a variety of topics for those in the meeting. The gluten free pizza was great which was a must. Overall the team liked the pizza, basic, not bad. I ordered a little more than needed, so definitely stick to 2 people per pizza if you get the salad.  Salad was awesome (Spicy Southwest)! Cookies were not good- big let down. Hard and not fresh, ordered a whole dozen too :/"}
{"text":"We have ordered two different pizzas per week here for months. Always insanely quick and delicious. Can't say enough about this place. My kids love it and it saves me from cooking. Great service."}
{"text":"The pizza is always AMAZING! The manager and employees always go above and beyond to accommodate me and my family being vegan, and we just love the delicious pizza here and lovely staff and good prices! Always come here!!"}
{"text":"I visited the location in Tempe on Saturday. It was clean, spacious, and the pizza was great. I ordered all of my favorites on my pizza and I could only eat half. I ate the other have for lunch the next day. The staff were friendly and it was a place I will visit again. Great lemonade guys. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Tried it on the count that it seems to be the latest rave.   Hardly anyone is in here probably because it's 3pm. I guess this is lunner, y'know the period between lunch and dinner. What can I say I didn't roll out of bed until an hour ago      At any rate, it's a quick ordering system once you get the gist of the on-demand-counter-ingredients selection process between pizza and salad. I decided to go with the Hawaiian BBQ pizza since this is a trial basis and I didn't want to ''Emeril' my pizza by 'bamming' just any ingredients on it.  I got my drink, sat down and a few minutes later the pizza arrived.  The first bite was tasty with the BBQ sauce somewhat overpowering everything else. The tartness of the pineapple and the bacon's savoriness followed through but a bit understated though. The crust was good while it's still warm but as it got cold it sort of became like toasted saltine crackers in taste and texture.  A thicker crust would probably have made a difference but it's not my concept.   Overall, it's a good experience and worth coming back."}
{"text":"This is my second time going here, first time was was alright but it wasn't great.  First thing was the dough that they were making my pizza on was pretty messed up and they just smashed it together whatever it was fine but then I was watching them take it out and it was completely burnt especially the the crust so  all they did was cut off the crust and gave me the pizza.  Really if I want to spend $10 for a pizza that wasn't that great I would just go to Pizza Hut or Domino's."}
{"text":"Not bad.... Actually pretty good. Nice people, quick service, decent food. Not to expensive either."}
{"text":"They use fresh ingredients when preparing your pizza. You can pick and choose your ingredients when building your pizza or add unto their already popular creations. The pizza crust is perfectly made in regards to flavor and thinness, not at all chewy and not too crispy like a cracker.   I had the pesto chicken with some add on ingredients: garlic, mushrooms, spinach, and spicy sausage. The mozzarella cheese is fresh and not stringy or spongy.   From my first bite to the very last, I was in heaven. Delightful, all the different textures and flavors intermingling with one another on that amazing crust.   The closest comparison in terms of taste and freshness is Papa Murphy's. However, the crust is phenomenal and not comparable to any other that I have had thus far. Firedpie keeps it simple but blows the competition away with its unique sauces and pizza crust.   The customer service at the 3110 Central Ave. location was fast and friendly. The dining area was comfortable and had its own self-service condiment and beverage section.   All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here.  It's like subway but it's build your own pizza.  The Dough is not thick and they have fresh ingredients.   I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!  I ordered a total of 6 pies!  We ate 3 and bought 3 to go!  It was fresh, fast, and served to is quickly!    The crust is so thin and you can put so many toppings on the pizza with no extra charge.  I ordered the chicken pesto pizza and added olives and sun dried tomatoes!  It was so good!  My sister visited from NY and she really liked her pizza too!    I had no issues with this place.  Customer service was friendly and courteous.  I'm glad I found this place shopping at Tanger!  I'm a new fan and plan on being back!"}
{"text":"Really good for fast serve food! Salads were fresh and thin crust pizza really crispy. And, the service was great...very patient and helpful as we took a while to decide!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the pizza and salads are great.  The staff is very friendly.  I have stopped counting the number of times I have eaten there and I never tire of it.  in fact, it is the one place that always receives a unanimous vote when our lunch group tries to decide on a placed to eat."}
{"text":"Never been. Sure glad I found it on Yelp!!! :). I ordered to go, the gal was super nice and helpful on the phone. She told me 10 minutes and I arrived on the dot while they were pulling my pizza out of the oven!! Awesome. Fresh! Fast and GOOD!!"}
{"text":"I visit Fired Pie often because it's close to home and reasonably priced.  But I might have to find a new pizza place because the last view visits have been increasingly disappointing.   Today the crust was so thin that it couldn't support my toppings. Never had to use a fork and knife to eat my pizza here but today I did.   My biggest complaint are the employees!!! There had to have been at least 5 employees in the main area and an additional two people in the back. One girl manned the register and another made the pizza, and some guy rotated them in the oven. But everyone else was doing NOTHING!. A line had accumulated and still just one person was making pizza no one else jumped in to assist customers.   As we ate our pizza, a man in line spoke up and said something about the lack of customer service as well. And the register gal said \"oh well we have a lot of cleaning up to do too\"..."}
{"text":"Eaten here I think 3 times now and overall I really enjoy the concept and food.   The bad: 1. This place is busy! Last night, line out the door, 25 min wait in line. The space and concept are ill equipped for such volume. Another reviewer suggested having people decide what they want at their table. Filling out little paper orders in line might help speed it up.   2. Not allergy friendly. I have no allergies personally but lots of cross contamination from gloves here.   3. Sometimes they overcook the pizza, leading to burnt crust.  The good: 1. Delicious customizable pizza with endless toppings 2. Fantastic value  Bottom line: The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"So disappointed that this turned into a Fired Pie! I loved Pizza Me and I really disliked Fired Pie!  What a bummer!"}
{"text":"This pizza could not possibly be better. This pizza is without a doubt the best pizza you can get outside of New York. The only complaint I have if that the company cares not if they mix their food. I see the cheese getting in the sauce, the meats mixing, everything mixing. It freaks me out. However, the food and environment is so incredible, I will not allow it to dock any stars. This is an A+ staple for me and my friends and family to eat."}
{"text":"My Fave! Line can be long but goes fast because they have a big staff and big oven! GF crust is dabomb"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza , friendly service , great value, and gluten-free friendly (ask for clean cut)."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon fired pie when looking for a lunch place to go during work. My fiancé and I had a call in order for two different pizzas {a veggie and a plain pepperoni} and the mixed greens salad w roasted veggies. It was during the lunch rush and when we went to pay, they had only made one of the pizzas we ordered which wasn't a huge deal bc we were just going to save the rest for dinner. The salad was amazing with the sweet balsamic dressing. So good. When the manager brought out the pizza, she also brought with her a card for a free salad or pizza. And apologized that they didn't make the other pizza. It was no biggie. Super awesome customer service. And the pizza was super delicious too!"}
{"text":"We love this place! It's like a sub way for pizza. Nobody ever wins with a big pizza; you just don't get what YOU want. This way everybody can choose what toppings they want on their own personal pizza. GENIUS! :-)"}
{"text":"Good affordable food. Salads are huge and pizzas are more that I can finish. Tasty and unlimited toppings. Venue is so so but I always get takeout."}
{"text":"So good and 11\" is a great size for the price.  I got what I'll call the Veggie Lava Monster--spinach, onions, grilled onions, artichoke, black olives, bell peppers, fresh tomato, sundried tomato, jalapeño peppers, garlic, cilantro, basil, oregano all on a bed of lots of tomato sauce and GF crust.   Staff was very friendly, though towards the end of my visit they got a little too distracted with training a new employee and sort of ignored serving new customers promptly.  If the business is going to keep up with increasing demand, the assembly line will need to be more focused and faster.  Still, very good experience overall and can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"A delight to find this pizza joint. A unique and satisfying place for sure. The customer service was perfect. They are fast and provide an assortment of iced teas. The food.....we didn't talk to each other because it was that delicious. One 11\" is all you need."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Love that I can get a very custom pizza with tons of options (sauce, cheese(s), toppings) and it's all one price no matter how much I have them pile on.  The pizza comes out amazing, and it's just the right size for me.    I've been to this location several times since I stumbled upon them and have generally had a great experience each time.  I do need to knock a point off though for 1) the last time I went in, one of the girls working there obviously hated her job and had a crap attitude and 2) they sometimes are a little slow to clean tables off when it's busy and people are looking for a place to sit.  I'm not above wiping my own table down when needed, so that last one wasn't a huge deal to me.  And I'll note, that one girl is the only one I've ever encountered at Fired Pie that way; everyone else is always upbeat and friendly.    To summarize, I repeat the important part: the custom pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the tomato basil pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni and was sick about 30 minutes later.  I've had similar experiences with Pizza Factory so maybe it's the dough or the sauce In these fast bake places that makes me sick. I notice the dough sits out in pans so not sure if that's the problem, because I thought the dough at other pizza restaurants is refrigerated before use but I wouldn't know. The taste of the pizza was good, however it just didn't agree with me."}
{"text":"First time here, gotta say that this place is pretty awesome! Clean restaurant and good pizza. Price is reasonable. Over all, i give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"I love that I can make my own creation on a pizza. Add whatever I want to and have it cooked just right. They are also the perfect size for one person."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Fired Pie!  I eat here often because of the great food, friendly & efficient service, and convenient location. (Fired Pie is a much welcomed site in my neighborhood).  Since I work long days, I often leave some of the cooking to the professionals, and Fired Pie does not disappoint.  Truly I eat here 2-4 times/week, and would gladly eat here every day.  Just ask Mark, Jamie, etc.  I am a \"regular\" & proud of it."}
{"text":"We had stopped going to fired pie for a few months because it was too stressful for us to have to argue to get what we wanted but we took the risk and went back. I'm so happy that we did because there was no problem. We were able to get the yummy pizza that we love so much without the stress! Thank you fired pie"}
{"text":"Very good, comparable to Fired Pie with some different toppings.  With recent Groupon, unbeatable.  I'm not a fan of the ordering process where you have to know all you want up front rather than walk down the line of ingredients and pick them as you go.  Regardless, very good cheap pizza and I think I like their softer, more-doughy GF crust than Fired Pie's.  I wish my pizza overall was a little hotter and crispier on this visit though.  It seemed to get somewhat cold rather fast and I like the veggie toppings to come out more cooked.  I think the oven might have been set lower that day for some reason though.  I'll have to see when I return if the pizzas are usually hotter.  The Nutella Strawberry Swirl is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Fired Pie I've dine at 2 different location and the food is wonderful as well as the value. This location in Awhatukee has service problems. It took them 40 min to make 2 salads and one pesto pizza to go. We order there and waited as the staff was on their personal phone. Another staff watching him. I saw a total of 6 staff and only one could put the toppings on the salads or pizza. It still came out wrong. Not sure what he others rolls are. It did seem that was to help the customer standing in front of them. It's a fun process at other locations but this one you need to come in with your patience hat on."}
{"text":"Fired Pie isn't Burger King but they allow you to \"Have It Your Way\"! My, My, My.....I am a new vegetarian at times it get very hard not to want meat, so when we ran cross this little spot while on vacation it was like finding a diamond within a beautiful pearl.  Their pizzas are so delicious and the atmosphere is friendly for both singles/couples. Whenever we are back in Chandler we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a place!!!  Fresh food, great prices!!!  Delicious pizza pies and salads made super quick!! Great place for a fast lunch when you don't have a lot of time!!   The Pookie is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"It's sad that the people behind the counter recognize me and remember my order (same thing every time!). The ingredients are fresh, which you can taste with EVERY bite.  I really appreciate the fact that I've seen the owner behind the counter during our last two visits, and he wasn't just giving orders, he was starting pies. Seeing that says a lot about his passion for his business and his customers. In the few minutes that we were there (we ordered to-go) he started a few pies (mine included) and walked around the restaurant to personally speak with the customers. Two thumbs up and 10 stars for that!   My new favorite pizza spot!"}
{"text":"For me, five-stars is the total package from food to atmosphere to service, and Fired Pies in Scottsdale hit it all on our trip there. We had a family of four and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The ambiance of the place was fun, clean and very chill - perfect place for a nice mellow dinner.  The concept of the restaurant is really kinda awesome - I can see this being a very successful franchise down the line. It's a surprisingly inexpensive meal, it's fun to pick your ingredients, and it's great for everyone in your party to get what they want. You might think you can't eat an entire 11\" pizza - but it's so good, there isn't much left to take home.  Awesome variety of ingredients that all work well and compliment each other nicely. There is something for everyone, regardless of how complex your want to make your pizza. I combined about 10 different ingredients and the pizza did not seem overstuffed or hard-to-eat.  Excellent assortment of teas - several flavors here including fresh brewed unsweetened black tea. The staff members were young, and all about customer service - they made a great impression on us. The owners should be proud of their employees at this location."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is amazing! Same concept as Chipotle, just pizza! You start by picking a regular or GF crust, sauce, cheese, toppings and spices or you may do the same with a salad. The customer service is great, the owner has been there every time i'm in and can be seen working behind the counter or walking around checking on tables. All the ingredients are delicious! All the marinated veggies are my favorite. Best prices for the quality, i payed around $8 for a pie and it served as 2 delicious meals!!"}
{"text":"I want to love Fired Pie, I keep coming back!  However, it really bothers me when they are so overly anal about portion sizes.  I totally understand cost controls can make or break a restaurant, however, either you want make it appear to your customer you are generous, or you just want to show you are plain greedy!  My son ordered a pizza, they measured the cheese so precise they took some out of the cup before putting it on the pizza and then the cheese barely covered the top.  I ordered a salad, they wanted to charge me extra for extra salad dressings.  It just plain didn't have enough on!  I didn't want dressing with a salad, but a little more would have been excellent for $8!!!!  Do your cost controls, but not to the point where your customers are clearly noticing!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with good options. Good atmosphere and friendly owner. Beer, wine, and some fancy frozen drink make it even better. The owner, Doug, is very friendly. Will come back and find other locations next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Loved it. Today got a half and half custom pizza. Twice as good!  He got an all over pie and wished he did the two sided also. Nice staff today"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Really good.  Please patronize so we can have great places in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The Margherita pizza I got was pretty good, but the crust was so thin that it was cold by the time I got home (just 5 minutes away). The toppings were skimpy, it was a bit greasy and there wasn't much sauce on it. It was also burnt around the edge on half the pizza. This also just wasn't enough for dinner. They did have it ready quickly and the staff was very nice, but I don't plan to go back. I'm going to try and find out how to post the picture I took of this pizza. If anyone knows how, please let me know. Thx!"}
{"text":"This sole star is for health reasons and service. Was never greeted walking in, with five workers just standing there as I scanned the menu. Very few people were eating in the restaurant. I was very hungry so I ordered anyway. A lady I assumed was manager asked rudely \"Salad or pizza.\" She was very cold and rude the entire time I ordered as well as the other workers. She had been moving equipment and never washed her hands or changed gloves in between making my pizzas and salad. Another worker played with her hair then handled my pizza with her bare hands. I was so grossed out. The food was fair. Never going back. Needs new management. I'm sure the chain under better management does much better."}
{"text":"I'm leaving out 1 star for average customer service. Sometimes its better than others, depends on who's working. Thankfully the pizza is ALWAYS amazing! I stop by about 3 days a week for my lunch break. Its soooo good!"}
{"text":"Saw this new place and decided to try it. Everything was fresh and delicious. For the price, it cannot be beat. I highly recommend the pizza and salad. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza.. Quick casual and very well priced. Its like the Subway or Chipotle of pizza. You walk in pick your sauce, Cheese, meat and veggies. And as many as you want for the same price.$7.95."}
{"text":"While Fired Pie still has a great pizza, the service has taken a nose dive. I witnessed a burned pizza being served to a customer (only to have it returned), slow service on the line creating the pizza, and utter confusion on orders. I had to clarify an order that wasn't mine for a team member and watched him create the wrong pizza twice. Finally, when I presented a gift card that apparently expired, management made no attempt to rectify the situation. He simply stated it was old, said, \"they do something different now\", and walked away. I am out $10 without even an apology. At this point, I would rather use Uber than witness this chaos again. It's sad to see this happen when they have a lot of competition in the area now."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat. Fired Pie had good Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint friendly helpful staff.  Great pie and side salad with balsamic vinaigrette was great.I will be back with my Wife."}
{"text":"Great new place for gourmet pizzas ! Absolutely loved the assortment of toppings you can build the pizza with. Have always been looking for a place like this and finally got one ! And they are affordable too.. Just $7.75 (any pizza) !!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Loved the fact you can build your own pizzas and salads all for $7.95! So many delicious options for toppings! I love that the pizzas have thin crust and are baked in a fire oven! They come out piping hot and crunchy just the way I like it. I didn't feel overly stuffed and overloaded with carbs! The size of the pie is perfect and the amount of dough was well proportioned.  All the staff that were working there was amazingly friendly, especially the guy who made my pie. Totally made my first time here a memorable one!  The place was clean and spacious, loved the dining area and the drink options. Loved the fresh lemonade and assorted teas!  Definitely will be back to try their salads out next time! My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The ability to cusomize and receive your pizza in 5 to 7 minutes is cool.  I've been going to this location since it opened.  Lunch crowds are heavy but the quality of thier products is worth it.  Unlike some other fired pie locations, they are never short of staff, so your pizza is not typically kept waiting due to anything other than the time it takes to process the number of orders and build the pie.  That is why I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price. Had the chicken pesto with sun dried tomatoes, crust was thin and baked to perfection. Amazing value for $8."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You can add your own ingredients to your pizza, and they look it right in front of you. We split a buffalo chicken salad, which was an awesomely huge salad and a Hawaiian BBQ pizza. The crust was thin, crispy and cooked to perfection. I wish Tucson had one, because going up to Phoenix to visit Fried Pie is going to get expensive!"}
{"text":"I loved Fired Pie but had an unfortunate situation happen here today.  It wasn't busy and I ordered a salad.  I was ordering a bit on the fly (typically I have everything thought out but this isn't my first rodeo).  I thought I was being respectful and ordering quick to keep the line moving.  Well when Mr Sergio (who was previously mentioned in Leah V's review from 3 months ago - check it out his photo in her review) got ahold of my salad everything went downhill.  He couldn't be bothered with providing any level of service.  Had an attitude when helping me with my short list of toppings and when I asked him to please mix the salad dressing - well that was too much and that was the end of anything else.  He huffed and puffed and clearly didn't want to do this but very sloppily mixed the salad and threw it into my to go container.  Guess that means no more toppings (i.e. Croutons or other).  And the container had dressing all over the outside.  Extremely rude.   It's disappointing that this employee seems to have the same attitude 3 months later.  Guess I can't be surprised because when I asked for his name I asked the woman handing out the completed pizzas.  She indicated she was the \"supervisor on duty\".  I let her know the situation and she said \"sorry\".  That's it.  She couldn't bring herself away from her post to listen to my concerns and make me feel valued as a customer. So I get it - this isn't the only Fired Pie in the valley and there are more and more of these businesses popping up.  I will take my business elsewhere.  I refuse to support businesses that provide crappy service.  There are too many options."}
{"text":"I hadn't planned on stopping here for lunch, but I'm very glad I did! I loved that you could build your pizza from ingredients right in front of you. Good prices and some of the best pizza I've had. Plus they had beer too! And great customer service, very friendly."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience today here. A young man by the name of Anthony made my visit absolutely wonderful. I am Deaf, and use ASL as my main language. Anthony can sign, and while still performing his very essential job of cooking the pizzas, he was willing to assist me with my order, and made sure that I got what I wanted, and that it was correct. He was AMAZING. I want to thank you for hiring him, and and think all your employees should have such a positive look on life and do their jobs with a smile. He went above and beyond, making this pizza the best I have tasted. #deaffriendly"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and the pizza was awesome! You order at the counter and they build your pizza in front of you as you pick toppings. I had the meaty Italian with spicy sausage and it was delicious! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Great quality, concept and service! Staff was helpful in explaining concept and options! Food came out fast and was great quality. For $8 you can literally get whatever you want on a pie. I'm won over."}
{"text":"New favorite pizza place! Such a great deal. Pizza is so fresh, made to order and feels healthy for pizza. Love their lemonade too. Friendly staff also. Save room for the Pookie! Warm, soft, chocolate chip cookie in a little pan topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adored this place! It's not the best pizza I've had but I've had Chicago pizza :). It was the best I've personally had in AZ, pick the right toppings and you can score. It's unlimited toppings for one price so don't be shy. The thin crust is great! I also like that they have gluten free pizza, sauces other than just red, and salads. They also serve China mist iced tea! The atmosphere is very laid back, we took our toddler and newborn and when the newborn cried it was missed by the other patrons because the music was nice and loud :)."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a casual place to grab a quick bite because we had been traveling all day and were cranky. We didn't want a chain that we could get back home and were intrigued when we saw the other reviews on yelp about this place. Overall, it was a great meal. You can build your own pizzas and salads- and not subway quality ingredients either. The sweet balsamic dressing is incredible so definitely give that a try if you get a salad. The crust is very thin so if that's not your thing then this place isn't for you. But the pizzas cook quickly in their pizza oven and are awesome!! The staff was very friendly as well! Very casual and delicious."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the pizza is horrible reheated. That being said I ordered pepperoni, olives, sausage in mushrooms with of course the garlic olive oil spread on the bottom. Delicious!!!! Can't wait to go back to Phoenix to stop by again."}
{"text":"Great way to have pizza.  The salads are generous in size. The service is excellent. The \"cheese and sauce\" guy was very friendly and informative. Worth a try! Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I am so glad me and my fiance tried this place!! As soon as we came in the service was great. The guy that took our order was very funny and friendly, even though we went right before they closed. The pizza is  soo yummy! The crust is thin and crunchy which i love. Definitely will be returning. Thanks for the great stuff! :)"}
{"text":"Affordable! Awesome crust, yummy! I had the chicken pest no cheese and it was yummy... Healthy alternative to pizza. My husband and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"We visited this location tonight and there was no customer service being served tonight so we decided not to eat dinner at this location.  We entered the restaurant and were given dirty looks because the 2 employees, 1 male and 1 female, were too busy trying to mop the floors and put away all of the food 30 minutes before closing.  My son had to use the restroom, so as we walked to the restroom the female employee said we just mopped where are you going?  I said my kid needs to use the restroom, is that ok?  She said I guess but that area will have to be mopped again now.  My wife waited in line behind 2 other ladies who were trying to get their pizzas made by the male employee, who was not happy, because he kept saying we are trying to close, but the 2 ladies kept saying, you have 30 minutes before closing, why would put all the pizza and toppings away with 30 minutes to go.  Both employees kept saying we are trying to close and can you hurry and tell me what you want on your pizza.  My wife had heard enough and decided we would spend our money somewhere else.  I will make sure that all my coworkers and friends know about this location and the rude service/employees.  Hopefully, the other 2 ladies will complain about the terrible, rude service they received tonight also."}
{"text":"There is nothing more aggravating than walking into a restaurant with 0 customers and 9 employees, but not one single employee acknowledges you even entered the building until 10 mins later when they call you up. 9 employees, 9!!!!!! 2 of which are \"working\" the others standing around talking about their hangover, girlfriends/boyfriends, & and other inappropriate conversations for the workplace. I've been giving this establishment the benefit of the doubt for far too long. The employees look at you like you're stupid and seem to hate their jobs! I've been to other fired pies and this place just seems to not be able to get it together. It's not a question of the food, the food is fine. It's the blatant disregard and disrespect for their customers. There needs to be some serious training put in place. There's no reason it should take 30 mins to get your pizza when you're the only customer and they're clearly fully staffed. A simple \"hello\" could go a long way."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled to get gluten free pizza with so many toppings!! I hadn't been able to have pizza for a while so it tasted wonderful!  Very friendly people and great service!"}
{"text":"Super amazing fast pizza and salad! My husband and I enjoyed a fresh buffalo chicken Caesar salad and a meaty Italian pizza. Everything is however you want it which is awesome since most places charge a ton for adding a little onion to your pizza. The decor is fun and festive, and very clean! The owner was very friendly and ensured our satisfaction. This would be an awesome place for after church lunches. Think of it as a mix between Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, and Oreganos, and all the best characteristics from each."}
{"text":"At Fired Pie you choose as many toppings as you want for your personal pizza or salad. They offer an extremely good gluten-free crust for a dollar extra. The format of the restaurant is Chipotle style, where they build the pizza for you while you're in line, and then bake it. The food is fast, delicious, and a good value. I am somewhat of a NY pizza snob, and still thoroughly enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I had seen the many reviews about Fired Pie, and since I was in the area I had to check it out.  It was well worth the stop and I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Simple, quick, very tasty.  I was skeptical about what the quality would be like with so many meat and cheese choices.  Everything was very good....condiments, cheese, sauce, crust.  What more could you ask for?  This local franchise is gonna soar.  My only suggestion is that they need to install a PA system and maybe a number system...the lady delivering the pizzas yelled my name and it happened to sound like my wife yelling at me so I cringed for a quick second.  Yelling out the customer name made the scene seem chaotic when it did not need to be."}
{"text":"Yummy completely customizable pizzas for low price.  Only reason it's not five stars is because three employees saw and then walked by a spilled sauce tub on the floor before I mentioned something about it."}
{"text":"Food was tasty (nice thin crust pizza, standard salads with fresh out-of-the-box croutons) but the place was not very clean. Uncleaned or wet tables, napkins and food on the floor, dirty silverware, wet salad bowls. Could do better."}
{"text":"One of my worst experience ever ask for extra sauce and The manager gave me the biggest attitude and wouldn't add the extra sauce once they have done it before in the past. What happened to customer service. Even the other manager when called to complain gave the bigger the Excuse that it's a big waste.  It wasn't busy at the time and he didn't want to make the pizza. One of my worst experience ever to order pizza. Avoid this place at all cost. Custom pizza huh?"}
{"text":"You can custom make your own pizza pie for a fraction of the cost of any fancy pizzería. The ingredients are all freshly made from scratch and are of high quality. You can definitely taste the difference! Love the make your own chicken alfredo! I'm not one to write reviews, in fact this might be my first review ever, but was so impressed with the great taste and amazing customer service for the small amount of money spent that I had to download the yelp app to give this place a 2 thumbs up. My ten year old even asked \"is there a way we can rate this pizza, mom this is delish\". The location we visited was on Ray and the 101 in the Whole Foods plaza in chandler."}
{"text":"absolutely *lovin it* good stuff, fast service no up charges straight to the point! Satisfaction all around from the pizzas to the salads."}
{"text":"Good stuff, but there should be more salad choices.  A little pricey for a walk-in/take out place."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Not only do they look delightful, they are tasty! The interesting thing about Fired Pie is that you go through the line and they add ingredients to your pie in front of you. Then fired fairly quickly. The pizzas are truly made to order. Try a pookie! These are freshly baked cookies, either macadamia nut or chocolate chip, with vanilla ice cream on top. A delightful end to your meal! Download their app. They automatically give you $2 off with your first payment with the app. The rewards can add up quickly. Great staff. Great owners."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about this place. It's a fast casual dining experience for delicious pizza. I like the pizzas, the space inside, the service is always nice, and the location is good (at least for us because it's not far).   However, I don't give it 5 stars. Here's why... when they have a line, it's not so \"fast\" casual and can take a bit to get through and get your food. To prevent this experience I simply make sure to visit before or after any rushes.   My only other gripe is that it doesn't seem like they use any local, organic, or higher quality ingredients. They have an opportunity to set themselves apart by offering cheeses that are from a source where there's no added hormones and pasture raised. If they had organic tomato sauce (and some of the veggies) that would be great, too.   Oh, and I must say... they have a good gluten free crust. It's the reason we go there at all is for the gluten free but I'd go even more if they bump up the quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Been there twice this week--- once for lunch and once for dinner. Believe it -- pizzas are ready in 3 minutes. Price is right and toppings and cheese are generous and fresh all made right before you.  Salads are good, however add-ins for salads are primarily pizza toppings. The owner says they are working on this as well as some additional dressing options.  For those of you who remember Market Bistro(7th st and thunderbird closed several years ago) the pizza salad offering is similar. Fired Pie hits the mark for freshness, great product and quick friendly service. As for the price -- under 8 bucks for a pizza and the same for a salad---- more than reasonable.  Try it out you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Very cool place, a make your own pizza joint with a chipotle style serving line twist. Super affordable. Just wish there was one closer to home!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I like the Tomato Basil with pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, red onion and fresh tomatoes on top after it's cooked.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's OK. It's cool to pick all the toppings and pay one price but the crust just isn't very good. If the crust isn't good, I'd rather pay more for better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to see that this was a \"Chipotle-style\" pizza place as it has been described. I tend to look past details like growing pains of a new restaurant (the soda machine wasn't working), or small details that were specific to my visit (like dealing with a new employee who doesn't get the menu yet).  So I'm giving 5 stars, because the pizza was really good and the ability to customize it for a static price was great. We, two people, spent $22 for two 10\" pizzas and two drinks. Definitely worth the money. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but the 5 stars are representative of the experience and the expectations I had. Plus, the best pizza I've had set me back $75 for 2 people, so not as accessible as Fired Pie.  The manager was friendly and super attentive.  The building your pizza process was neat.  The pizza was great.  The only thing that could be a drawback is a relatively small parking lot... But there was a construction dumpster taking up a lot of spots when we went, so that didn't help.   Anyway, I suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"I like this place, its like subways with fresh pizza and salad which are GOOD AND CHEAP, my complaint lies with food handling, my daughter is a vegan so no cheese, and wants all veggies, but the worker wears the same gloves he uses for meats on the veggies! They need to separate the meat/veggies so no cross contamination, use tongs and gloves wouldnt come in to play. As a local establishment you would think they would know better as im sure lots of veggies eat here.My no chicken southewest salad is bad ass tho!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Right across from Gold's Gym & Los Sombrero's, it's easy to miss being set back off Northsight a little. I'm from Chgo where pizza is king and Fired Pie pizza is one of the best! The crust is so thin & crispy and it's unbelievable how quick it comes out of the oven - 3 to 5 minutes? It does remind me of Chipotle in that you step up to the glass case to view the wide assortment of toppings, including your preferrence in cheeses, meats, veggies galore, etc.. There's also a choice of sauces to start. I love their pesto & DH got marinara last time said it was very good. The spicy sausage & spicy chicken are very good. Their mushrooms and chopped garlic is fresh. Actually, everything we request is fresh/delicious. One visit we both ordered salads for the same price as a pizza - $7.50? Salads were big! Mine came with fresh onion, I asked for extra and got it. Their chipotle ranch is very good. There's a nice selection of craft beers which DH liked. I've tried their pinot noir & chardonnay by the glass and both were very good & the price was great. They have some tables outside. We've been here 4 times for dinner and only once was it real busy. The staff are all so very friendly - no attitudes here. For the most part, its families or retirees/snow birds we see. Therefore the only suggestion I would have is keep the music mellow so peeps can have a conversation. Once they had heavy metal playing probably for the young staff. We couldn't hear ourselves talk. When we asked if they could turn it down, they did, so that was nice. If dining in, they bring the pizza to our table, 2nds on beer/wine, you get it yourself. It's so refreshing NOT having TVs!! Wish more places avoided tvs. If we want to watch TV, we'll stay home. We hope to see this place really take off!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat before a game. Made to order pizzas customized with your choice of dozens of toppings -- ready in about 10 minutes. Has a beer license. Seating inside or on patio. Very reasonable prices -- great alternative to stadium food."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Great food and great price!!!  Custom made pizza with good thin crust and quality ingredients. I will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times now and it is always delicious pizza and great service!  They really do listen to their customers as well. My gf brought it to the attention of the owner that there was no changing table in the restroom (being that the place is pretty new not surprised it was overlooked)  Next visit about 2 weeks later and of course they now have one!  We were pleasantly suprised!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"While yelping for something different to eat downtown came across this place. Sounded like a cool place kids would like. I like that you can make your own pies from a really good selection of sauces, cheeses, meats and veggies. The pizza itself really depends on you we bought three totally different styles, I'd say be smart with toppings keep it to 4-5 toppings max or pizza may get soggy.  Only thing I really did not care for wasn't the cleanest upon entry the outside patio was full of empty beer bottles on most of the patio tables and inside tables hadn't been cleaned either was big turnoff. There were no obvious drunks and atmosphere was pleasant  enough and after about twenty minutes someone did clear all tables and check in on us. Would try again if in area but not on Saturday night."}
{"text":"For a dine out experience at a reasonable price you must try fired pie in tempe . Awesome wait staff . And a limitless topping pizza for 7.95$ . Took about 5min. To cook and serve. Salads awesome also!"}
{"text":"Great improvement from the last time I was there! The music was lower and the employees were awesome! As always the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I had one of their giant salads and it was soooo good! I will definitely be back to try their other salads."}
{"text":"The most exquisite, unique, and delicious pizza of all time is back and better than ever at their new Avondale location, being a Fired Pie enthusiast, of course I had to see the new store. Not only was I treated to see the stunning layout of the the brand new store, I was also treated to free pizza just for coming. How can you beat that? I went in with 4 other people and received a pizza per person. Absolutely incredible, not only was it free, it was also outstanding in every way imaginable. The crust was cooked to a crispy perfection, the toppings were portioned flawlessly, and I was served with a smile as well. All of the big-name Fired Pie all-stars were there as well, including 2 of the owners, 3 managers, an area supervisor, and countless supervisors/employees, adding flare to the environment. This was the greatest dining experience I've ever experienced. Because nothing tastes better than something that is free. Rock on."}
{"text":"So I've decided that I'm going to post a review for every Fired Pie location. This was the first Fired Pie I have gone to aside from the Deer Valley location (which I worked at). The date of this trip goes all the way back to December 17th 2014. I went with some coworkers to check out what another Fired Pie would be like, and man was it different. For the sake of this series, I want to give a disclaimer and say that ALL of the Fired Pies are completely different from one another, it's a trip dude. But yeah, the reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the customer service was below average. The dude in the black shirt was quite rude to us while we were creating our pizzas. But aside from that, the pizza was great and so was the pookie. Overall I enjoyed my experience but this is not the best Fired Pie I have been to."}
{"text":"I had an extraordinary experience here. I paid this store a visit on November 4th, one day after it opened. The girl who started my pizza didn't seem too interested in talking to me, but the second guy did. He claimed he had transferred from the Ahwatukee store, he was pretty cool. Aside from him, none of them really seemed to know what they were doing, which added a mild level of entertainment to my experience. However, the store had only been open for 2 days at this point so I shouldn't have expected anything else. Anyway, the climax of my experience transpired at the register where I was faced with a charming young lady by the name of Paulina. Her blissful aura lifted my spirits to attain a high level of happiness. She made my experience. The food was wonderful as always. If I could change anything I would have added just a little more Alfredo, but other than that it was perfect. 10/10, great food great service all around a savory experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I come here weekly. It's affordable and healthy.  You can custom design a salad or pizza and it all costs the same. My family gets their own personal pizzas and I can have a diet compliant salad.   Staff is pleasant and helpful. The restaurant itself is always tidy and bright. We rarely encounter a big crowd here. It's a great place to go before the movies.  I am grateful for restaurants that adopt this model because so many of us are struggling to make healthier choices."}
{"text":"The gluten-free had one of the better crust that I've ever had. It was remarkably chewy (for gluten free) Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome spot- highly recommend!!! Best pizza around- crust is perfect and the toppings are fresh and delicious. Go for the spicy Italian sausage and some garlic- yum yum!! Please open one in Texas."}
{"text":"First-time at this awesome place. Thank you for thinking of this. Soooooo much better than Pizza Bianco plus it's fast and friendly. Fresh ingredients you choose or pick from the list of favorites. Chipotle style ordering. Excellent crisp, thin pizza. Crazy that no one thought of this sooner. Only problem I see is that I will be craving it."}
{"text":"Would have been a 5 for food alone but the customer service was horrible! Snotty girl up front! First time here and got more help from another customer in line in front of me! Easy concept but I was so distracted with picking all I wanted on my pizza that I was at the register and wanted a salad too. Well snotty girl says all rudely u need to make sure and order when u order pizza and tells other girl to give me a salad and other one just as rudely asks what I wanted on that salad. Really rude service!!! But food was great! Fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Had a great Steak and Blue pizza. Delicious...extra toppings were an added bonuse. Pizza was cooked to perfection.  Alternative music was great too!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and is well worth the long wait in line. My favorite part is the option to add any fresh ingredients at a fixed price. The price is affordable and great for lunch or dinner. The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"The best pizza menu in the valley! Fired Pie has the perfect choices for me and my girlfriend who is a vegan with a gluten allergy. The pesto chicken pizza is my favorite and Brianna and Sarah made it perfectly! They are experts at remembering me and my girlfriend, remembering our favorite orders and cooking it as crispy as we like!"}
{"text":"Gluten free  Pizza. Soggy crust, vegan cheese was okay.  Dressing drowning out my salad.  Minimally engaged staff.   Cashier unhelpful.  Could not finish my meal. DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Quick and good. I didn't care much for the red sauce they use. The crust is alright, could be better."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's awesome how you are able to customize exactly how you want your pizza. I also like the fact that you are able to split up the pizza in half. Which makes it easier where you did have to order two different pizzas if you aren't able to eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"I love the pizzas here! As well as the salads. The portions are huge and it can last me all day. I don't eat big portions so I like that we are able to spilt the toppings on one pizza if I am sharing with someone."}
{"text":"Fired Pie has combined fast paced food and pizza to a new level of dining. You can go healthy or indulge in traditional style pizzas all for a modest price. Food always fresh and staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"First time eating here and ordered the \"just cheese\" pizza and it's pretty good, the dough could be a little bit thicker, but I would come back."}
{"text":"Don't go here on a Friday from 5-7. The pizza is anything but fast. Fast is the first word on their homepage so that's sort of their thing- until they get busy. Twice it has taken over 20 minutes for our order. The last time I was in the pizza took more than 40 minutes and they made one wrong so the second time they made it it was undercooked. So, that's the last time."}
{"text":"Excellent! Good value and the pizzas are fantastic. Definitely would recommend and very family friendly."}
{"text":"Great Place! I eat here all the time. Their crust is so good and I love the fact that I can put anything that I want on my pizza. Who wouldn't love that? The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly. Plus they are super fast!  If you love pizza like I do, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I think this could be the perfect lunch.  The portions are just right.  The toppings are very good.  The staff is fast, polite, competent and plentiful.  Prices are appropriate.  It is a regular stop for the people in my office.  5 stars well deserved."}
{"text":"They make you feel like a criminal of you ask for more toppings than they want to give you, then tell you it won't cool right, but it turns out better every time. Is it build *your* own pizza or build *their* own pizza? Never got any sweat at Pieology and they also have more types of crust."}
{"text":"I have had pizza at the Ahwatukee establishment, I have been pleaed until my last experience on 4/15/15.  I ordered my pizza along with a friend, she received her pizza, it was almost 30  mins before I got mine, they kept asking me if different pizzas were mine and they all had olives on them which I told them several times what my pizza had on it..  They finally made me a new pizza and it was burned on bottom and edges as was my frend's pizza.   I was extremely disappointed in service and in taste of pizza.   It would have been nice if they had offered to give me a free pizza on that day or the next time I come in.   It will be a while before I go back if ever.  Dottie"}
{"text":"Outstanding, service was excellent!! Joked around with staff while making pizza they even offered suggestions, When the pizza was brought to our table it was perfectly cooked I had the GF crust it was awesome,toppings were fresh and added even more flavor. The price was extremely reasonable for the quality of food If you haven't ever gone give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Super good pizzas, I loved my combo.  My kids could pick their own flavors, and it was fast.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Very tasty for inexpensive pizza and unlimited toppings is nice for the same price. build your own and enjoy."}
{"text":"Where to begin. The pizza was fresh and made before my very eyes. The staff greeted me upon entry into the restaurant and was friendly and attentive throughout my time there. The pizza was great and I love the thin crust, it makes me feel better when I over eat!!!  This is the first time I have ever been here and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place for a fresh individual pizza.  You can select from the menu or they will make any pizza to order.  The salads are amazing!  Lots of variety and they are huge! We come here at least once every week!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately must have changed ownership in May 2017. Use to be excellent now barely marginal.  Customer service has gone down hill. Willingness to add extra toppings not well received. Pizzas are now burnt (3 desperate visits and all burnt). Amount of toppings have decreased. Overall below expectations vs other fired pizza establishments."}
{"text":"The concept is fantastic - best pizza because it has what I want on it. The dough/crust is superb. First timer and plan on being a regular!"}
{"text":"Great place for fresh baked pizza ! Everything is prepared right in front of you and you get to customize almost completely - which is a great service. The prices are reasonable and the menu is super simple. The ambience is fantastic."}
{"text":"not bad, but Ill Bosco pizza is far better"}
{"text":"OK, cheap pizza, but nothing special. I was encouraged when I walked in, but the bland pizza and very mediocre service probably won't have us going back. We ordered 5 pizzas and they yelled out our name over about 10 minutes. Would be nice to have everyone eat at once...that's not \"wicked fast\" IMO. Lots if work to do to rival Sauce."}
{"text":"I attended the free pizza on Tuesday.  It's a fantastic idea that staff get a free practice, (potential) customers have a sample and restaurants get free advertising and feedback.  I'd been craving pizza for ages and was excited to be able to create my own pizza on top of it.   As a vegie lover, I asked the guy serving vegetables and may I add repeatedly asked him for one of each vegetable.   They can do this action at Subway so what was wrong with  this guy?  After every vegetable he stopped and gave the chintziest amount as possible if he chose to place some on.    Anchovies were not placed on the pizza; not mine and not on my friend's.  Twice in a row they  got it wrong.  Unlike me he complained so we had to wait longer and my pizza got cold waiting to dine with him.  The manager was rude and shouted at me rather than  helped me get heard by deaf staff.  No, it was cold and not tasty and the way I got abused was for free.    Service didn't happen nor did they meet their advertising for if you don't get what you ask for how can you build your own?  Were the manager civilized he  would help me and I would be inclined to return.   In fact, after reading the reviews on Yelp we shall be trying MOD as it is a similar style.  The build it yourself was the draw card for me.  It didn't happen for me at Fired Pie, Tempe."}
{"text":"Fired pie is our favorite of this type of pizza places. We have been to this location several times since it's the closest to home, and have always been very pleased. The service is always fast and the place is always clean. We ran into one seriously rude girl on the assembly line once and just laughed it off. I don't know her name but we haven't seen her since. Everyone else has always been cool here."}
{"text":"Amazing personal sized thin crust pies.  Try the Hawaiian BBQ pizza with added chicken.  Top notch quality and taste. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. The service was quick and the staff was friendly. Location was clean and you can smell the goodness as you approach the doors. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 2 years now.  We choose this over other pizza joints due to the quick service, friendly staff, and the pizza can be made how you want.  Always tastes good, and under $10 is hard to beat.  Thank you to all of the employees here!!!!!"}
{"text":"omg!! I came here for the 1st time on my bday today and it was complete heaven!! Pricing was great, staff was very nice and friendly. Environment and Experience was phenomenal indeed!! Will definitely be there again!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by with the whole family on Friday, August 9th.  The place was very busy which we expected considering it was in the paper that day.  Anyway, even though they were busy, the service will still outstanding.  As other people have mentioned, the concept is to be able to deliver a personally designed pizza in a short amount of time.  This place has nailed it.  By the time we sat down after ordering, our pizzas were already coming out and being delivered to us.  With all the ingrediants being fresh, it's hard to go wrong here.    If you are in the area and looking to get a \"pizza fix,\" this is the place."}
{"text":"It's the Chipotle or Cafe Rio of pizza.  And that isn't a bad thing.  I won't rehash what everyone else has already said about how you choose your own ingredients, but will comment on the one thing that makes or breaks a pizza - the crust.  It is clear to me that when this concept was being developed a lot of effort went into developing a crust that could be pre-stretched on a paddle ready to receive ingredients, would cook quickly, and best of all, actually taste good.  A concept like this could easily have been destroyed by serving whatever ingredients you want on top of flavorless cardboard, but in this case they really did it right.  Of course it isn't the best pizza of all time, but for what it is - a custom made pizza with whatever you want on top, made and baked to order in about 5 minutes - it is a home run.    My biggest suggestion on how to improve the place would be to have beer on tap instead of just in bottles.  But if you don't want beer or wine, their iced tea options are very good (China Mist) along with the standard soda fountain.  Two people can each get a pie, a drink, and split a pizooke for about $24."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Service is always amazing. The manager there is awesome she is extremely friendly and really makes lunch time enjoyable while you wait and order your pizza. The whole staff there laughs with you, jokes with you and they really personalize your visit."}
{"text":"Pesto Chicken is amazing, add some artichoke too.   This place is an exciting new find! Look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, tasty, and gluten-free friendly at a great price!!! Thank you Zack for your personal attention to us & great pizza skills."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at this specific location. However, just recently there was a unpleasant situation that had secured between two younger ladies arguing. For me it was very uncomfortable and shocking that this was happening on my lunch break. The two young ladies continue to bicker and argue in front of the customers using foul language and I felt very offended it was very inappropriate and unacceptable. This is not the first time I have seen this happen here at the specific location! The good thing was the this young gentleman actually did try and settle the situation the best he could but the young ladies still proceeded on and went outside to argue and put their hands on one other. I was appalled I could not believe my eyes now that I've seen this and know what kind of location it is (unmanageable )I do not know who the manager is (he/she was not present)  but they do need to get on these young ladies and teach them how to be proper or simply not allow it again and not to mix personal situations with work. I am no longer going to be at this location, it is unfortunate for me that I have to go out of my way just to be able to enjoy my lunch break, when I have been going there for quite sometime.  If it hadn't been for that young gentlemen (who's name I cannot remember)  I would have called the police.  The food is great but it is a shame this is how this store is being managed!  Never have I seen such behavior.  Need to make much needed improvements or this location will continue to lose their customers."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza at a great price. This place is rapidly becoming my favorite lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast, the place works like a well oiled machine.  Go for one of their creations and customize, the taste is top quality.  The soda tastes great as well, I'm looking forward to being a regular."}
{"text":"Maybe saying the Subway of pizza places doesn't quite measure up. I'd rank it in the same tier as Chipotle. The staff was super friendly as they breezed through  assembling the perfect pie. If you're new to this joint, and super hungry, skip the menu. You can look at it while you're eating your delicious creation."}
{"text":"Staff isn't very friendly at all, they all have attitudes that make us not order from here as often as we would if they were more inviting.   However the pizza is incredible. The steak and blue is the best thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"The girl who was making my pizza made me wait because she was taking her time chatting with the customer before me. When my turn came, she was really s-l-o-w. Like, did she even undergo any training at all?  I also saw piles of dishes at the back that none of the other staff cared to put away nor hide from our plain sight. And they were not even busy.  They were overstaffed. Bad manager, I guess. Too bad, I love Fired Pie but I'll have to go the Tangers branch.  1 star for the pizza. 2 thumbs down for poor service."}
{"text":"Great pizza ! Salad was awesome !  Highly recommend ! Haven't been down here in awhile and was super stoked w amazing food & service"}
{"text":"Talk about my new favorite place to get pizza! I LOVE this place, it is seriously so good. The crust is perfect, all the toppings are fresh and you get a completely personalized pizza in under 5 minutes! I have yet to be disappointed in any way. You can't beat the price and they have really good ranch and don't charge for it. The staff is super nice, and are very generous with toppings :)"}
{"text":"Thin crust wood fired pizzas with fresh ingredients. The best pizza I've had in a long  time. Devoured the whole pie. Amazing."}
{"text":"Make sure you let them know you want your pizza UNDERCOOKED if you don't want the bottom completely charred. Great selections of topping for pizza and mix-ins for salads!"}
{"text":"I love the food. A lot. So many options, so many great combinations. And the price is quite reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and the pies were great. Had the buffalo and Hawaiian BBQ pie. Staff was friendly, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is excellent as usual. However service was extremely slow. No sense of urgency, no one behind the counter seemed to care the line was getting longer. Half training was occurong. We will etc at Fired Pie again but not this location!"}
{"text":"As always, very good!  Wide open seating area. Great staff and made to order pizzas!  I've been to many different locations. This one has ample indoor and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"The best place to have customized pizza for $8.99. They also have the option for gluten free base."}
{"text":"The create your own pizza thing is really cool. It's like a subway for pizza. The staff is really friendly and try hard to do exactly what you ask.   My pizza fell on the floor and that almost ruined my experience but the girl gave me a discount on my new one and a cookie.  They so earned a tip.  Advice: the top and bottom of the box are not connected"}
{"text":"I have to start with saying I LOVE Fired Pie! We eat here all the time. However, as much as I appreciate a special. (Today was $4.15) I would have rather paid full price. I understand they were extra busy especially for the Park Central location, normally it's dead after 5pm. But....my pizza was HORRIBLE today . I was sooo excited about picking it up after work to bring home and now.........I'm just bummed. They slopped it together and hardly put anything on it. I asked for crispy and it's barely cooked."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome pie! They did forget my added mushrooms, but we're quick to make me a whole new pizza. So appreciate the customer service. The pizza itself was done to perfection. I can definitely see this being my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"A very unique and fresh way to enjoy pizza. Use choose the ingredients, meats, sauce, cheese, and vegetables, as many ingredients you want, for one very affordable price."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food was good, but one of the employees needs a bit of a lesson in customer service. May is customer appreciation month with BOGO pizza or salad. The guy in front of me presented his coupon to which the individual advised him that the coupon would be honored this time, but they will not accept the paper coupons in the future. When I came up to the register I presented the same coupon and was advised that my coupon would not be accepted as they did not accept paper coupons.  So customer appreciation only applies with a coupon that isn't printed on paper... not sure how that's supposed to work."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free  This a great for Gluten Free crust.  It could have been a little more crispy but it was Saturday night.  Toppings are great.  Great Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm speechless. This place is beyond good!  Finding somewhere to eat at the Tanger Outlet Stores was always a challenge. It was either the Nestle Tollhouse and Coffee store or the Wetzel Pretzels. Now though, there is absolutely a place to eat you have to visit even if you don't plan on shopping. This place is worth the drive and the parking issues at the Glendale Tanger. $7.95 seems a little ridiculous for a personal pizza but it's a bargain in my eyes. It's more like $7.95 for a gourmet pizza and it's still seems like a bargain. Ingredients were fresh and the pie was baked to crunchy perfection. Finally, Tanger has that special attraction worth visiting. I'm fired up for Fired Pie."}
{"text":"For the price, the quality was awesome and i love building my own pizza.  We went for lunch and the line was long but moved quickly.  The end result was an awesome pizza for only $7."}
{"text":"Out of all the fast pie joints that recently opened this is one of the lower ones in quality. I keep trying this place because i love pizza, but it continues to disappoint. The pies need to be FIRED....cooked longer. Even when i ask them to cook longer, they still come out half cooked. There are several of these concepts that i much prefer over Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Two of the pizzas came out burnt and then when they incorrectly made a pizza the manager came out with the new pizza and insulted us making sarcastic remarks as if we should be grateful for him making the effort. Not returning to this place ever. MOD on AZ Ave is much friendlier and better pizzas."}
{"text":"I love Fired Pie the pizzas have thin and crispy crust . It's a great place because it's easy to grab and go . You can make your own pizza , and there are variety of toppings to choose from. I recommend Fired Pie to everyone.    I love Fired pie, the service is great ."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been going since they opened this location and it quickly became my favorite cheap eats. I love how many options they have. Their toppings bar is fully stocked with high-quality ingredients. My husband and I typically split a salad and a pizza. It's the perfect amount of food for two- maybe even a little too much :) They (fairly) recently started serving pizza cookies, which are delish. My one complaint is that they are very, very small to share."}
{"text":"After a long day at work. I was taking my 5 year old son to get a Cheese Pizza because that is what he really wanted. When we walked in as the door was still open and they had about 7 employees standing around and customers still eating inside ... we were turned away ( don't know if maybe the employees were a bit older they would perhaps care I bit more when my son is standing there holding his toys wondering why we were being turned away).  It is a terrible feeling to tell my son that we were 4 minutes to late. I will never come back to this location again . I headed down the street to MOD Pizza, we had great service and most importantly my son had his cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I eat here daily. Excellent customer service. Staff is awesome. Great food and prices.  Place is always clean."}
{"text":"First time and really enjoyed!! Workers were quite unfriendly is why I only gave it 4 stars, but food will bring us back!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh ingredients.  Excellent customer service.  New to the area, called in my order and ready right on time.    We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Pizza choices for all!  I have a family of three and all of us have different tastes.  My young daughter had an extra cheesy,  hubby had the veggie,  I had ham n pineapple. Wow everyone was happy! The thin crust was excellent.  The staff was friendly and atmosphere inviting.  I appreciate the wicked fast service,  especially with a small child,  time is of the essence when they get hungry. We have been back and will keep on coming!"}
{"text":"I tried Fired Pie tonight for the first time. After standing in line and agonizing over how I was going to customize my pizza (soooo many choices), I saw that they have house pizzas. The Steak and Blue pizza intrigued me, so ordered it. The dough was brushed with oil and then it was topped with garlic, mozzarella, gorgonzola, sliced steak, mushrooms and roasted peppers and onions  I asked for artichoke hearts, additionally. About 8 minutes later my masterpiece was baked to perfection! This was the best pizza,  although certainly the most non-conformist, that I have eaten in ages! I would return for this pizza, though I'm fantasizing about the combinations I can create, all for $7.75 each!"}
{"text":"Really like the food at Fired Pie, it's always busy and the people are friendly!  Whole west side of the restaurant really needs some better A/C,  Fans and/or sun shades because in the summer you can't even sit on the west side of the place without sweating up a storm and being blinded by the sun.  That food though! Yum"}
{"text":"Food is great but they don't honor their promotions and false advertise. They posted on Facebook that one pizza per customer is 4.18 for tax day without specifying participating locations and out of three locations only one honored the promotion. Another didn't honor any of the promotion at all and a third honored only for dine in which is not listed on their advertisement. They also don't respond via Facebook. Quick way to lose my business."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever!!! Had a minor problem and the manager went above and beyond to fix it. Will definitely be going back lots :)"}
{"text":"Deliciously thin crust, wide array of toppings and cheeses, freshest salads, and friendly customer service.  But friendly to a fault.  We all got so caught up in conversation that we all forgot my cookie for dessert.  In fact I didn't remember until hours later.  Yes, I was that full.  I'm sure they will correct this on my next visit as I will return.  The pizza is THAT good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Fired Pie because I love pizza... But this place was just okay. Maybe it was the combination I created or simply I wasn't in a \"pizza\" mood. I left feeling unimpressed. I might go back to try something different, we shall see."}
{"text":"I really love going to these build your own pizza places. I've been to the Fired Pie in chandler and it was great. This one not so much! The pizza was average, less toppings to choose from than other similar places and the Ceaser Salad was bland and lacking in true ceaser salad flavor. Overall it was average.  There are many other better choices."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. If you want great quality pizza without feeling heavy after you eat it....don't go any further......awesomeness...... i have ordered several times thru uber eats delivery very fast pizza hot,fresh and delicious : )"}
{"text":"All pizza places seem to feature design your own pizzas, Fired Pie just seems to do it better.  You start with a crust (pretty good size for an individual pizza--maybe about 10\") and you select your sauce, cheeses (my favorite is the fresh mozzarella), and toppings (meats, vegies, herbs, etc.) from the counter in front of you.  Pay $7.75 and something like 5 minutes later, your pizza is delivered to your table.  The best parts are the speed and the fact that the pizza is really quite good.  The worst part is wondering why someone else (like me) didn't think of this concept first.    While the Fired Pie concept is new, I fully expect that there will be several imitators in the not very distant future.    Give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Quality food, quality service. This is not your average pizza place. Hard to believe they can reinvent the wheel but believe me the pizza's are excellent."}
{"text":"I've always loved Fired Pie and still do. This location however is horrible. I was tempted to take a video of the guy who was putting sauce on the pizza for like 5 minutes (not even joking). Everyone working here was doing things so slowly not understand how long ppl were waiting in line. Will never come to this location again. I am writing this review at the restaurant after waiting for 40 minutes just to order and another 10 min to get the pizza. FYI there were only 7 people ahead of me when I came in."}
{"text":"Great place for a custom personal pizza. Personally I think it tastes better then the other custom pizza places I've been to. The new Pieology off of Chandler Blvd doesn't quite have things buttoned up like this place. The only issues for Fired Pie is the crowd at lunch, and trying to find crushed red pepper when everyone has taken the shakers."}
{"text":"Hot diggity folks, I loved lunch here today!  1st time visitor, I tagged along with a group of guys from work, and was really pleased.  I had a bbq hawaiian pizza, and a soft drink and it was roughly 10 bux for the whole deal.  The pizza was aweome!  Thin crust and delicious, just like I like it.  I already located one closer to home, so I'll definitely be stopping by there with the wife the next time we are on the mood for great pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here several times both before and during the lunch rush. Prices are great for all the ingredients you can get on your pizza or salad. Staff is very friendly and accommodating and they keep the line moving. The thin crust is nicely done and not overly crispy like a cracker. I like the fact that you don't have to wait a long time for your pizza to cook. Love the freshness of all the ingredients. This is my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza your way. Only down fall music is way to loud. Super service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's decent. Wasn't amazed by any means. I feel like the point of having a subway style pizza place is to have odd and uncommon ingredients to make it a fun experience. This place didn't even have green peppers. Fired Pie will be a good standby until Pizza Five85 re-opens."}
{"text":"This was my first time here the food was awesome the people were great.  They were very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and ordering process."}
{"text":"I dont appreciate people there not paying attention. i came on my 30 min lunch break, at 4pm and ordered my pizza. at 4.10 finally was called up to get my pizza. i thought it was odd that the lady AFTER me got her pizza before me. since i only had 20 mins left i hustled to get back to work so i could eat my pizza before my break was over. when i got back, i opened it and it was NOT my pizza. they gave MY pizza  to the lady that came AFTER me, and i got hers. so i had to walk back, i told the girl at the register what happened. She asked if i want them to make another one, thats a stupid question yes i do! i paid for it. so another 10 mins later i got my correct pizza. at this point it was 4.25 pm 5 minutes until i had to be abck on the clock. i never got to eat my pizza, and i wasted money for it. I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK! bad service, the girl should have paid attention to whos pizza was whos. i even saw her add basil to the WRONG pizzas while i was waiting.....train your staff"}
{"text":"Its good for what it is but not my idea of a good slice of pizza.  I'm a die hard new york style pizza slice type of person.  I did like the \"build your own pie\" aspect of the process and it was good with fresh, tasty ingredients.     The price wasnt bad either but I'll save a couple bucks and get a slice and"}
{"text":"Spent my birthday lunch at Fired Pie!  My new favorite pizza hangout!  The staff was great and food is addicting!"}
{"text":"I love the concept. But by far this is the worst experience of any of the many subway pizza places I have been to. The service was horible and the  topping where nowhere near fresh. I prefer studio pizza and my pie to this place any day."}
{"text":"I've grabbed pies from this Fired Pie on four occasions so far, my latest trip was last night.  Tons of topping selections including sauce/cheese/meats/veggies/fresh herbs and you just go through the assembly line and pick as many of each as  you want for $7.95.  The crust is thin with a cornmeal dusting on the bottom and the ingredients are fresh.  Every time I've ordered red sauce gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, parmesan, garlic and fresh oregano and each one has been great.  They're not cheap with the toppings either which I almost expected given the price.  I haven't tried their salads yet but I'm sure they're just as good.  Fired Pie gives the better pizza places in the area a serious run for their money from a taste perspective which is surprising considering you can generally get out of there in about 10 minutes with a fresh and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Our very first visit there was good and the employees were really nice, although this was just a few days after they opened. Since then some of the employees have been rude, they are not consistent with the way they make the pizzas, and the continuously burn the pizzas. The other Fired Pie locations I have been to have been much better than this. Too bad to since we live so much closer to this location."}
{"text":"Custom designed 11\" pizza for only $7.75 with as many, or few toppings as you desire, including premium ingredients like feta cheese, fresh mozzarella, capicola, Kalamata olives and more....At no extra charge.  This is a very thin crust, but not a cracker crust, but thinner than I would usually prefer, however the toppings more than make up for it.  They also do custom salads and take out.  The place can fill up quickly and there have been long lines, especially around noon.  The good news is that there are several other places to eat at this location if the line is out the door and you prefer not to wait."}
{"text":"Omg..... the food here is SO GOOD. everything is fresh and just sooo tasty. The workers are polite and the restaurant is always clean. If I could eat here for lunch every day I would.... Hahaha the pesto pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Went to this location and is just as good as their other location in Glendale. Great pizza & I absolutely love their concept about creating your own pizza! Clean place and staff were attentive."}
{"text":"This is pretty easily the best of the recent trend of make your own pizza for a flat price due to the fact that they do cook in a real pizza oven. I would still always choose a real pizza place above one of these though. Great for a quick lunch or for those who don't agree about toppings."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating fire pie and the pizza was amazing! I got margherita style and added veggies! Yum! When I came in no one smiled or seemed enthusiastic about their job. There were several dirty tables and the floors were dirty. With some many people on shift, it didn't seem understanding as to why there was a mess and it being so slow. Still will come back though!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It was eight bucks for an 11-inch pizza with all the toppings that I wanted on it. Super good pesto, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. I was pretty surprised when I walked in that I was the only one there. I really hope this place blows up because it's freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza on my most recent visit to Fired Pie. It did not go well. I got my pizza to go and left. I went to my car and decided to have a slice before heading home. Two things jumped out at me right away.   Apparently, the pepperoni they use on their pizza curls up, which forms little containers to hold the grease from the pepperoni. This pizza had more pepperoni grease on it than any pizza I have ever seen in my life. Now I know what you are thinking: \"Of course it was greasy, it was pepperoni!\" I have been getting pepperoni pizza all my life and this was excessive. I am guessing it has something to do with the pepperoni they use. I had the same pizza from Pieology about a week ago and it was NOT drowned in grease.  The second thing was that the cheese on the pizza was not even fully melted. Yuk!   I took the pizza back and I knew there wasn't much I would be able to do about the pepperoni grease so I just told them about the cheese not being melted and they put it back in the oven for a while. Unfortunately this did not help things much at all since the pizza was still drowned in grease, and to make matters worse, the bottom of the pizza was covered in too much soot from the oven. Probably from the pizza being slid all over the oven twice. I just threw the pizza away."}
{"text":"Pizza and salads very good as well as the pookie. Only complaint is a few of the staff are pretty rude not very customer friendly. I'm still a believer in telling a customer thank you and some response."}
{"text":"Awesome pies. Quick, easy and flavorful!  Convenient location.  Great Prices.  Must experience."}
{"text":"Great local place - think subway only pizza!  I only had the pizza and it was awesome.  You first start at the dough (all thin crust), what kind of cheeses do you want (like 7 different kinds), what kind of sauce (tomato, white pizza, buffalo pizza) then move on to the meats, then move onto the veggies.  All pizzas are 7.95 no matter what you get on them.  We paid, got our drinks and about 5 minutes later the order was called.  Great concept, quick and relatively inexpensive (around $10 bucks with drink, tax, etc).  I will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this spot for the first time and love the concept idea build your own to your liking. Unfortunately both my wife and I got very sick after eating here but still gave 2star for the staff they were very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a breath of fresh air in the west valley. I love fresh hot pizza and you can't get any fresher than this. The variety of toppings at no additional charge is a party in my tummy so yummy!  The salads are huge and the prices are very reasonable.  The staff and workers are very friendly.  I love this place. If you are from the Midwest Fired Pie is like Blaze Pizza.  What are you waiting for go join the party at Fired Pie!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! So many options, wonderful pizza or salad if you want to go that route! Quick service and great value for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I know these type of places are popping up everywhere like gourmet burger joints... But this one is my favorite... Can't say I've had the same pie twice... Fun with the family, everyone gets what they want"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is great. They make your pizza right in front of you, with fresh ingredients. You can choose from your standard pizza fare, order one of their specialty pizzas OR you can come up with whatever crazy little combo your fatty little bacon-loving heart desires. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The pizza came out great and it looks like the ingredients are high quality.  Giving it 3 stars since when I went there yesterday around 1:30 PM I saw several empty tables dirty and the one trash can in the whole establishment full to the max.  I will go again one more time but hoping the place looks cleaner next time.  Luckily we have choices in the area with Mod pizza close by."}
{"text":"Went here for the gluten free pizza and was very impressed. The crust is similar to gluten crust and the list of toppings is broad. It is a great place if you have people with a variety of tastes and everyone can get their own pizza. The price is also quite good. The Alfredo sauce with feta cheese is a bit salty but very tasty all the same.   It is a chain and I can't speak to the other locations but this one is located in an outlet mall which cheapens the vibe a bit. But I wouldn't let that hold you back. The pizza is tasty. The salad menu is also good looking but why eat salad when there is pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza & salads are great.  1st Fired Pie we tried was at the Tanger outlet. We have gone to the one on Agua Fria a couple of times. Today I was bothered by one of the employees sweeping, then placing her fingers from the broom to the clean salad bowls, then back to sweeping then taking pizza from the tray to a box. She did not at any point have gloves on, or do I thing she would have changed them in between jobs. I think many young workers forget they are protecting themselves with the gloves on, but not us;( Not sure how I feel about going back to this location??~??"}
{"text":"The pizza & salads are great.  1st Fired Pie we tried was at the Tanger outlet mall. Clean, friendly place. We were at the location at Deer Valley Towne Center the other day.  We noticed an employee sweeping the floors, then putting her fingers on the salad bowls, then back to sweeping, then placing a couple of pizzas in a box. All with NO gloves on. Biggest issue would be, that many young workers don't understand that their gloves protect them, but NOT US!!!!! So I'm not sure they would have swep, then placed gloves on to deal w/dishes & food???? A quiet vacuum seems better, being the dirty floor particles would not be flying around in the front fresh food area. Not sure how comfortable we are going back to this location?~~?"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place. I had read a lot of the reviews and was hoping that the negative ones were not true. Wrong. The pizza was very good the employees were something else. No hi or welcome just poor attitudes. The girl at there register had to be told three times that I was eating in. If you really hate what you are doing go find something that makes you happy. Don't push your BS on to the customers"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Excellent in all aspects, quality pie , reasonable price and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great n more  great is what comes to mind first... The flavors are still bursting in my mouth when I leave.  The variety of toppings is fantastic let alone the SIZE OF your Salad..WOW.  the staff at central ave location are very friendly and eager to satisfy....  spread the love and open more locations..."}
{"text":"Better than most like this. I've tried others,  and this is an all inclusive.  You don't pay per topping like at other wanna be's. The line can get a little long though since it's at the mall. I would recommend for sure !"}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick and delicious pizza, then look no further. I hit up the Central Ave location on Sunday's after church and their staff has always been friendly. You select whatever ingredients you'd like on your pizza, so it's really up to you on how delicious you make it, but they've got plenty of options and they are all fresh and tasty toppings. I also feel like the price is out standing for the quality pizza you get. Always a good experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh ingredients! Nothing fancy but delicious pizza. They also gave us 2 free cookies w I've cream for not letting us know we didn't need to wait in line for them. If you're craving pizza but want something a little lighter & on the healthy side stop by! Reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! The thin crust was baked perfectly with a great selection of quality toppings, all at a reasonable price. I'm very picky with my pizza and this is the best I've had in quite some time. Only negative is they don't deliver to Pittsburgh,PA where I live!!!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience....... I personally did not enjoy any aspect of my meal starting from the rude reception that we received when we walked in. It was like we were interrupting the employees chat time. There were four employees behind the counter and at least three dirty tables in the dining area and the drink station could have used some attention. I split a pizza with my husband and we both got a salad and both kids got a plain cheese pizza. I also wanted a glass of white wine and there was only one option- a Pinot Grigio that was not very good. The kids said their pizza was okay but slightly burned on the bottom. My husband and I had the pesto pizza and I couldn't even eat one piece, the evoo was dripping down my hand. Actually my biggest complaint is that our meal cost over $50! Wow! And there was only cheap plastic silverware available. For $50 we shouldn't have to eat with cheap plastic silverware. We will not be returning, there are many other great similar options."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!!! Great price and perfect portions. Try the steak and blue pizza with the jasmine tea. Nummy!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch spot. Great pizza that is wood fired and prepped the way you like it. Highly recommend the buffalo chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few days ago and man was I hooked! The pizza was awesome because it was my creation of course. You can put all the toppings you want and it's so cheap ! I was hesitate to eat there because I feel like all pizza taste the same but it was so worth it. The pizza is has thin crust and you can make it any way you want it. The staff was friendly as well. My pizza got a little burnt in the oven so the girl made me a whole new one. She even gave me a free dessert. Which she really didn't have to because it wasn't that bad and I would of ate it anyway but she refused to give me a burnt pizza. I recommend this place to everyone !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what else to say, great price, great flavor, fresh, friendly staff, we liked it so much I ordered a 3rd pizza and this time I picked the toppings and they put in everything I asked still the same price and it was amazing. Dare I say this is my favorite pizza and fast causal dinning place."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Plenty of toppings to choose from so even for picky eaters. They also have a gluten free option as well. Quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered a meaty Italian pizza via Uber Eats. They send me a crust! Seriously, a frickin' crust, no cheese, sauce or meat. Being late in the evening, I was to hungry I ate the darn thing. I called and all the guy had to to say was I'm sorry, their dough machine went down and I should try and contact Uber... No customer service, shameful."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant concept! It is the Chipotle or Subway of wood fired pizzas. I would invest in this type restaurant in a minute. Their salads are delicious as well and both are only $7.95 each."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall and worth visiting. My wife and I were quite hungry and this little placed was recommended to us. It was awesome. Loved picking my ingredients for both salad and pizza toppings.   Everything tasted great and food was ready in just minutes."}
{"text":"Great product, but painfully slow service. Maybe it will improve once the staff has more experience on the job? Don't come here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy! I get multiple sauces and cheeses on mine. The pesto is fabulous! I like to stick with one or two meats to not overload. Prices are great too :)"}
{"text":"Customized, personalized pizza shops seem to be the rage right now.  Prior to the \"Fired Pie\" experience, I was beginning to believe this rage to be trendy but not necessarily delicious.  Well this place completely changed my mind.  The ingredient options were similar to other chains, but these ingredients were awesomely fresh, and the staff really knew how to arrange the ingredients to optimize and balance the flavor, which enhanced the overall pizza experience.  The staff was extremely friendly, and so willing to walk me through their process.  I got nervous when my pizza was ready so fast...my first thought is that the ingredients would not be cooked well enough to mesh....once again, thankfully, I was wrong.  That fired pie was fired right!!!  Wonderful staff, very clean dining room, and super tasty deliciousness.  Looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix and my next bite of Fired Pie."}
{"text":"I recently purchased pizzas from this establishment during a convention weekend;however, the staff seemed to be stiff and gave attitude when I asked for ranch. The pizza itself was good for the price being advertised."}
{"text":"We come here for the amazing yummy Salads! Huge portions and definitely enough to share.   Today we had the gluten free pesto chicken pizza.  Crazy good! Nice to find gluten-free options :)  Very fast service so great on a lunch break!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from CA where we have Blaze Pizza (similar concept), but Fired had much more selection when it came to sauces and toppings. I love that they had buffalo and BBQ sauces you can use as a base as well as chicken that was already marinated in those toppings, making for a much more flavorful pizza!  I also love that their spinach is already cooked so that it doesn't get too watery once it is put on top of the pizza.    I had a buffalo sauce base with buffalo chicken and veggies and it was perfect!  I also had a little salad, which is a great value at $4 and comes with 1 cheese and 3 veggie toppings.    What a yummy lunch after a day of visiting Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West :)   We only wish they would bring Fired to LA so we don't have to come all the way to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on groupon and love it! Been here 3x now and have not been disappointed. The pizzas are thin and delicious and the service is great. The owner and employees could not be nicer or more accommodating. I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Food is great! But for a Friday night they had a bunch of teenagers running the place the service line was running so slow and we didn't understand why until we got to the front. You had 2 girls chatting about some conquests, a guy who loved his high fives from the veggie chopper guy. So food great, service poor."}
{"text":"The pizza was surprisingly good...good crust and fun to create your own.  The problem lies in the ordering process/flow - I had 3 different employees shouting questions at me when I was ordering 3 different pizzas at once - as each one moved down the line, they were all shouting to me for the next ingredient...it was weird and awkward. I didn't know who to answer.  Then, when one kid jumped in to help, another employee started arguing about the portion size he was giving.   If you're ordering more than one thing, it was definitely obnoxious."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I love fired pie but this location failed. Not enough staff causing everyone to run around like chickens with their heads off. As a result my pizza had the added flavor touch of burnt corn meal rolled up in my pizza because the young lady couldn't get it to slide off the board properly.   My pizza was a red hot mess.  My husband wouldn't even eat his because it was so burnt."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fresh and delicious!  Great customer service too!!  It will be my go to spot for excellent pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! My husband and I came here tonight, from Missouri and visiting parents. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone --date night, etc.! The service was excellent, positive and upbeat. The food was great, and the crust was crispy with good flavor. We split a salad (yummy dressings) and each got a pizza, and had about half a pizza and no salad leftover between us. Tried the pesto, tomato and garlic sauces, all good. Meats fresh, veggies good. Only thing I would change is to offer fresh (vs pickled) jalapeños. Great value!"}
{"text":"5 stars for parking. Sunday evening was quiet. There was an empty parking lot of about 500 stalls.  5 stars for speed of service  We were the first ones before the Sunday evening mini rush  1 star for menu options   Its pizza and salads- & 1 dessert, I think.. not options for high protien  (like me,) or kids options (I have 2) .. 5 stars for quality of food.  1 star for portion size. It's very skimpy and the toppings were few . 5 stars for drink options  5 stars for Cleanliness and decor    We loved it and thought it was a cool spot."}
{"text":"What can I say. Great pie for the price. Love the thin crust pizza reminds me of pizza you get in Italy with the nice burns on the corners. Add the garlic and butter to the dough. You add the toppings you want. Fresh toppings. Always full of flavor. If you want a great personalized pizza this place is the spot. Try the iced teas too."}
{"text":"They're pizza tastes so much better than most other places. They've got a thin crust thing going on but it's so good and you don't feel gross after eating it. The pizzas are a good size 8.29 for one and you could split it amongst two people. They have a great selection of toppings. The only reason it's not 5 star is because the employees weren't friendly. For example, the guy brought the pizza to my table and didn't say a word and I said thank you and he didn't say anything just walked away. Maybe he was having a bad day but overall food is great!"}
{"text":"Fast and convenient. Pretty good pie. You can't expect a gourmet experience in the pizza equivalent of Chipolte, but they put out a good product. Staff was very friendly, the store was clean, and the service was quick and courteous."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza! We ordered the Steak and Blue. You can add as much toppings as you want all for the advertised price! Go get some!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed, been here 3 times and every time is chaos and burned pizza.  Cool concept, poorly executed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been here a few times a week since it opened and everything I've tried is amazing. Cheap, fast and perfect pies."}
{"text":"This is my 8th visit to this Fired Pie since end of July- our weekly Saturday night pizza night! Each pizza has been great with fresh ingredients. Each week I try to change it up, so last week got the regular crust, oil and garlic spread and a little bit of marinara sauce. Then, fresh mozzarella, roasted onions, tomato slices and basil. I wasn't sure if I would like the fresh mozzarella, but did!!!   The last three weeks Dionne has cooked my pie, and is a friendly and personable employee. She recognizes me now when I come in. Also, Garauv has helped me for three weeks and is  pleasant and friendly, as well. While it is extremely important that the food is of high quality, so is having the right employee representing one's company- Dionne and Garauv both fit that bill!!! Already thinking about next week's pie!!!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with Fired! I am gluten free, and their 'almost gluten-free' was THE BEST crust I have had in a long time. Additionally, for the prices, I would say you more than get your money's worth!  I highly recommend Fired for their reasonable, fresh and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Bestest in Gilbert! Thw accessories are tastier. The dough is thin n not thick to overtake the toppings. None to compare with!"}
{"text":"Well, it's better than most Mod Pizza's I've been too :P  The herb-flavored gluten-free crust not only satisfied my allergy, but also my palate as it has a satisfying crunch with a tasty flavor. I'm glad I stopped in and stop to the wonderful GM too. Thank you to the courteous crew who made my pizza :)"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients.  Casual atmosphere. A very busy place, but it's busy because it's delicious."}
{"text":"When a good pizza is becoming a rarer a rarer commodity, Fired Pie delivers a satisfying answer. Delicious mozzarella, fresh and seasoned tomato sauce, a variety of toppings. Could it be create your own pizzas hold key to our current pizza woes! Although a few more options for toppings would be nice I was very happy with a fresh, tasty, fast pizza. Selling point: the crust! Real deal."}
{"text":"Great place to go before or after a downtown ballgame. The Chipotle analogy is appropriate: you start with a blank crust and choose your sauce, cheese, and toppings, then in a remarkably short amount of time you get your custom thin crust pizza. I was a little skeptical my first visit there, ordering mozzarella with sausage and pepperoni, but next time I'll be a bit more adventurous with my sauce and topping choices. Price very reasonable for the quality of pizza you get. Definitely on my list for quick downtown dining."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow what a horrible experience !!! Go in at 12:30 and didn't get through the line until 1:00pm. Not because it's busy, the place was empty. I wish we would have seen that as a sign and turned around! The people working the line couldn't figure out what to do. 5 people on the line and people are waiting a half hour to even get to cash register !!! Never again"}
{"text":"I really like the combination I chose with garlic and olive oil, fresh mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, and feta, mushrooms, ham, and artichokes. The crust is a nice crispy thin crust. It's really good. I'd say it's a good price too. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I frequented this place once a week prior to moving to the other side of town. The line moves quickly, the ingredients are quality, and the staff always remembered me. It can be fun to experiment with different pizza combinations and this was my favorite place to get a quality but quick salad. The pizza cookie makes a yummy dessert!"}
{"text":"I was happy to find a Fired Pie location in the mall when I went to make some returns. Same options as a regular location and my pizza was ready quickly. You can get a completely customized pizza or salad for the same price as most food court slices."}
{"text":"Of all the build your own/quick cook pizza places I've been to Fired Pie is my favorite. I've been to multiple locations and the food is always consistently good.  I usually order a pizza but their salads are fantastic as well. The ingredients are quality and tasty. Can't beat a yummy pizza for less than $9 and I always have leftovers.  This location is right by ASU and a lot of offices so it can have a pretty big lunch rush. They keep things moving along pretty quickly. The dining area is open and spacious."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Clean, friendly staff, my order is always right and the pizza is always fresh and tasty.  This is our new go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Go to fired pie if you want gross pizza and to support a sweat shop that treats their employees bad."}
{"text":"First time here. Really nice prices. Got all the toppings I wanted for just one price. The salad was really good.  Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Seriously disgusting. I got a salad here and the lettuce was grimey and wilted. Couldn't even eat half of it. The guy putting the veggies in was dripping sweat and it was hanging off his chin I was worried it was going to fall in my food. The person I was with got a pizza and that was tasty but honestly, I was just too grossed out by the time we sat down to eat. I'll never come back here. Hopefully their management will take the wilted ingredients and sweat dripping from their employee's face seriously and fix it, because I can't imagine this place will be around much longer operating as it did today."}
{"text":"This spot is quite a pleasant surprise. It has been other restaurants and apparently never worked until this time.  I would say that it's a hidden gem for the easy fast and good food.  Just one price no matter how many toppings you get, good taste, great salad, fair size portion. Nothing not to love about this place.  Quick service and comfortable dining room.   From the time I arrived to the time I left there was a line, but it moves pretty quick.  I'll be a regular, for sure.  Did I say that the prices are awesome?  Cheers"}
{"text":"I always have an amazing experience at this place. I believe the manager said his name was Danny. Each time I visit everyone smiling, efficient, and ready to help. Thank you for always making my choice eating her a pleasant one. Way to go guys and gals."}
{"text":"Like most people I know, there is nothing better than a good pizza. They put it in your hands at this amazing find. You choose the sauce, cheese, and toppings, and out comes your personalized thin crust pizza. Great concept, great quality."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a quick and customized pizza of your choice. The service with a smile and friendliness added an extra star. The Pizza was very good although its not a Chicago type pizza but the thin crust was just perfect for what I was looking for. The place looked pretty clean even though it wasn't busy considering I went there around 3pm. The only drawback was the music was a bit too loud and no menu on the wall where they take your order but there is one as you enter the place. Oh and they only have one size of Pie. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Love the whole subway concept for pizza. I don't know whats better the pizza or the price!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get pizza! The ingredients taste so fresh and the crust is amazing."}
{"text":"No chicken on a small salad?!  And don't roll your eyes when my 7 year old can't make her mind."}
{"text":"Food was alright, would like to come back and try other menu items, but customer service was exceptionally rude. Unprofessional atmosphere & unsanitary. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great deal, great pizza.  It's all about the crust.  Great crust.  Have the pookie.  Skip the bellini."}
{"text":"This place was okay to try on a one time basis, but we probably won't go back. The chick making our pizzas almost knocked over some empty bins, so she grabbed them with her gloved hands. Then, she proceeded to continue making pizzas without changing her gloves! There was about a 10 minute wait, and the tables weren't very clean. The pizzas were cheap and decent, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Awesome made to order custom pizzas and salads (don't forget to ask for extra toppings if you want!). I don't know why more people don't know about this place."}
{"text":"It is pretty neat to make your pizza or salad to order. Most of the toppings are good but, the meat selections are not so great and the place is a little pricey.  The pizza is good but the salad was just okay I kinda miss Neapolitan."}
{"text":"It's the \"subway\" of fired pizza on really thin crust. You chose whatever and however many toppings you want. Be ready to have patience if there's a little bit of a line... Of course, people can stand in line for 15 min looking at the items, but when it's their turn, they turn into dumb-founded jack wagons and hold up the line. Really??? And of course, you also get those incompetent parents who have to ask their 5 yr. old what they want at least 10 times... C'mon!! Go to Chuck E. Cheese and waste everyone's time there."}
{"text":"I love the pie but whoever the front male employee is today at this location was rude!   So unlike the typical vibe the other locations have.  He even tossed the pizza on the table when it was done Very very unhappy .... I will NEVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION AGAIN ####UPDATE ....... 2-10-2016. After receiving a message from the owner I look forward to having him address the concern and being able to give this location the same FANTASTIC review as his other locations! Thank you"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me is probably wondering why it has taken me so long to write a review for Fired Pie. I just had to wait because I really thought it was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. However, after 6+ months, I still can't find anything wrong.   This is the best pizza place I have ever been to. The fact that you create your own is what wins me over. You get to go through the line and choose whatever toppings you want.   I have only been adventurous and tried a salad once, which was good as well.   I have never been disappointed in Fired Pie and I go on average once a week. The staff is extremely friendly, they also learn your name if you come in often which makes you feel even more welcome.   Great job to the staff and the creators of Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is an easy alternative to the average ho-hum meal. It was easy in and easy out. You get to choose as many toppings as you want for $7.99, which means my stepson had a great time filling his pie! My only mild complaint was that the pizza was a bit over done which made the outside ridges extra crispier than a normal wood fired pizza. Next time I'll ask for a bit less cooking time."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. It is delicious the crust is thin and perfect! It's fresh will go again. They get your order right away don't need to wait longer than 20min to get your pizza."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is amazing! We went to the one in Ahwatukee, and I can't wait to try the one in Tucson. The pizza is absolutely delicious for a nice afternoon lunch, and the prices are hard to beat. My only criticisms: the staff was a bit slow and unresponsive. When we asked for napkins at the table, the server never really came back. But, the restaurant is mostly self-serve, so it's okay. Also, the $3 pookie is so cheap for a reason. The cookie is truly meant for one person, so don't try to share it. We tried the pesto chicken pizza and the veggie pizza, and both were out of this world.Try this place NOW. Just be warned that the portions aren't too big, and shouldn't be eaten for a dinner-- more of a lunch dish."}
{"text":"Called ahead and asked if they could make two cheese pizzas. Arrived and they hadn't started them yet. Admittedly, they were swamped with people in line but they didn't seem to have it together. They ended up giving our pizzas to another family. Since we had a show at Symphony Hall (and they knew it at the onset) time was of the essence. Asked for a refund and they were apologetic and gave it to us. I was sad--it looked like the pizza tasted good."}
{"text":"Went in to get a salad and a pizza with my friend today, the lady making our salad was flinging food everywhere while mixing it and put so much dressing on it, that the leaves were wilted before we even started eating it. We couldn't even finish the salad. She also got her dirty hands all over our bowls from making a pizza right before. We also ordered a pookie and she forgot to ring me up for it and then 20 minutes later, she asked for my card to charge me for it and start making it. Then 10 minutes later she tells me the ice cream is all melted and it won't work on top. I told her we were already done eating and I just wanted a refund on my pookie. She acted put out and that she had to find her manager across the street and I said, ok never mind I guess, and she said, sorry, and walked away."}
{"text":"Update: So we can back because we love the pizza and salad! Everybody was so happy, welcoming and friendly! Thank you for the wonderful service today!!!   We absolutely love the pizza, salads and lemonade! However the service is another story. I have never been treated so rudely. And more than that the families behind us were also treated the same. The mother behind me actually said to the girl making the pizza, \"are you kidding me?\" After she rolled her eyes and was just throwing the stuff on the pizza. We went for a month straight every Saturday, so gave them plenty of chances. The guy sweeping the floor was so sweet and interacted with all the customers. However the people making the pizza and salads were rude every single time we went in. So needless to say we certainly won't be back to this location! We are in the service industry and I was almost going to video the way everybody was treated since I couldn't believe my eyes!"}
{"text":"Best fire brick oven pizza I've had!  I love pizza and this place was a stellar find! Must try everyone!"}
{"text":"Our first day was 3/4/2016 a Friday night and it was crazy busy. I could tell it was just a bad night. Out of the 3 pizzas we ordered they got one right and the others were burnt hahaha!. They gave us a full refund.  The pizza they got right was really good. Everyone deserves a second chance so we went back last night and they recognized us and was very apologetic and gave us a complimentary pizza and desert. The manager owned up to everything. The pizza was amazing and we'll be back. This place is a great addition to the west valley !"}
{"text":"Came here for Friday lunch with co-workers, and the experience was better than last time.  It's Friday, so the place was packed. I got a field greens and roasted veggie salad with balsamic dressing. It was one of the best salads I've had. To be fair, my a huge fan of anything with balsamic.   Side note: that have pizza salads! Like a salad on top of a pizza (see my photo).  Overall a good experience, will come back sometime soon."}
{"text":"First time here! It's Friday, I'm too lazy to cook and wanted something umm and quick. So happy I stopped by. Love wood fired pizza and this place is super clean and delicious. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Walked in while slow and received nothing but attitude from the staff over a basic cheese pizza, and once it was more busy the other staff that came from the back room gave just as much attitude. I even asked for a side of hot sauce and received an eye roll from the cashier. Would not recommend again."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Tried 4 different ones and all tasted wonderful.  Ordered, paid and by the time we sat down the pizza was on the table.  All associates working were friendly and fast, on a Friday night no less.  Fresh quality ingredients, nice people working, fast service = a great experience.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place when it first opened and did takeout. It was awful!. The crust was like cardboard and the whole pizza had no flavor. They need to make up their mind if fast or good is what they are aiming for."}
{"text":"I'm a FAN!  I'm not a big pizza eater, but THIS PLACE!! WOW! Super yummy, not too expensive and the staff is friendly and fast!! Thanks for making my lunch so much fun!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I were excited to learn about the excellent pricing and unlimited toppings! We ordered and picked it up within 15 minutes. Another bonus is how fast the service was. Not only was the pizza delicious but it was easy and quick to get it ordered. We will definitely be trying other pizza combinations in the future. Great job Fired Pizza!"}
{"text":"Everytime I have come here the service is just okay! The employees seem like they could care less about being there! And the manager gives everone some pretty dirty looks and just sits around doing nothing!  And the pizza is not amazing its okay, over all its cool you get to build your own pizza but to be honest I don't really recommend this place to anyone looking to get pizza...."}
{"text":"What seemed to be the manager was making our pizzas today. After asking for a vegan pizza didn't change his gloves after touching meat and mozzarella cheese. Been to Blaze pizza multiple times and they change their gloves and even have a different pizza cutters. Very disappointed. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best pizzas ive ever had(if you like thin crust pizza). Tons of toppings. Fresh tasting...i'll be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the service and the customer service are bad. Five employees standing around and you have to ask for someone to help you out. Then they make the pizza and it just sits there. 30 mins in and out is a long time to wait. When complaining to the manager, the response was, oh sorry about that. Do you still want the pizza? How about you just make the pizza in a timely fashion and this rating would be a 5. Instead they never fail to disappoint. Tip--be rude like they are and insist they work at something other than a snails pace."}
{"text":"I love this place, used to work here. It's usually, very clean minus a dirty table here or there. And I usually have no problem with it until today. Everyone completely neglected the dinning room and the dishes. They were giving the customers dirty plates to eat on including myself. And the silverware were absolutely disgusting. I understand that it gets extremely busy in there but there is absolutely no reason to have dirty dishes and a dirty dining room. We were understaffed when I was working there and we were still able to keep everything clean. Health inspectors and secret shoppers don't care about how busy it is, they expect everything to be perfect. I will not be going back to this store."}
{"text":"Pizza was great.  Very tasty.  Service on the other hand was pretty bad.  Tables dirty, trash overflowing. Seemed as if it was torture to be working there. Everyone with a frown on their face and no sense of speedy customer service.  Lots of people with gauges in their ears just kind of standing around when there was a lot of people to be helped.  I get it you hire high schoolers that need a job but damn would it hurt to have a little atmosphere in there."}
{"text":"Out of all the \"make it and wait for it to bake\" pizza joints out there right now, Fired Pie is probably the best overall for sauce/crust/baking. We alternate between here and the location at the old Park-Central mall. FP works for us and we like the topping choices. If you put much more than 5 topping types on a pizza, you're gonna get a soggy mess. I'm big on both sausages, the roasted peppers, and the sun-dried tomatoes. Maybe a hit of the garlic, too. The rest of our family eats pesto-chicken pizza the most and some mix of salads. Hint on the salads- always have it made \"for here\" and if you really want it to go, then add to the to-go box. The size difference is pretty magical. :-) *** We just went back to the Avondale location to try the new \"cauliflower crust.\" This is much better than we anticipated. A winner for sure, even with the $2 upcharge. The crust might be better described as rice-flour crust w/ cauliflower, but if no one told you what the crust was, you'd just think it was a super-think regular crust. Give it a shot if you are reducing wheat flour in your diet. It doesn't taste like a vegetable. *** Like many west-valley eateries, this place has trouble keeping the tables clean and clear, but at least they've added more trash cans since they opened. *** Staff here is polite but they're not going out of their way to engage customers. If you want that, try a Bennigans. They're comfortable enough for getting your pizza made. *** In all, a regular place for us to eat this type of pizza. *** Safe for kids and grandma to eat at, too."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Maybe because I foolishly had low expectations, or maybe because I can get a bomb thin crust cheese pizza for $6.   I went in about an hour before close on a weekend, and was in and out with my cheese pizza and a Caesar salad (I'm a simple gal) within five minutes.   Both items were executed as they should be -- solid, although not spectacular, but the price and the large sizes of both are really the selling point.   Ample seating, although I chose to get my food to go, and service was pleasant. Will definitely be back soon to build-my-own pizza."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many times before, but has gotten worse. The place was freezing cold on a night when it was not even warm outside. The music is overwhelmingly too loud-so much so, that the staff could never hear us across the glass! The customers cannot hear the staff either. Also, the blond female staff member at the first station hardly seemed like she knew what she was doing. It would be helpful to have the ingredients labeled so we would not have to yell across the glass continuously asking what everything was."}
{"text":"Based on so many glowing Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to try Fired Pie, and it was delicious.  Yelp scores again! ;-)  We decided to choose the \"invent your own\"  11 inch pizza option, and it was ready in about 5 minutes.  The ingredients were really fresh, the crust was perfect, and it satisfied both of us for just about $8.  We definitely shall return!"}
{"text":"For $7.95 you get a 11\" pizza anyway you want. They only have thin crust but all the toppings you can think of. The sauces are awesome and the toppings fresh. The service is quick as they use an actual pizza oven to cook. I highly recommend this place. It is one of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"I love fired pie! The prices are so reasonable and the staff is very friendly!! My favorite girl there is Chloe, she is always so attentive and friendly and makes my pizza with extra love"}
{"text":"These fast build-your-own pizza places are great in a hurry and surprisingly very tasty. I usually order something off the menu like Marguerita or hawaiian pizza, but always add jalapenos. On my last visit I ordered a side of caesar salad and boy that thing was huge. you can order a pizza and salad to share with one or two people, but I'm pretty sure you'll be alright alone. The veggies are always fresh and service is great!   It never occurred to me to write a review, but the service this last time was *super* great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Huge patio, great pizza, and a good beer selection.  I LOVE you that they have Marble brewing.  Our group of 8 was just as excited as me when came here last Saturday night.  Staff was great too!  Can't wait to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Great fresh pizza! Love that you can create your own pizza and salad that is freshly made in front of you. They have a great selection of toppings, so you can get pretty creative with your food.  I usually split a pizza and salad with my friends, since it's plenty for two. The last time I came I had the veggie pizza that they have listed on their menu, which was good but I prefer to create my own. You can't complain with the prices either, especially considering the fresh ingredients that they provide. Good customer service. Only complain is that the line can move slow if you go during the lunch time rush...but it's to be expected considering they make it as you come. Overall yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza is super yummy! We tried 3 different pies and enjoyed them all! The store manager Luigi was very nice and personable and the staff working were great making our food. The atmosphere is laid back and has lots of seating. I'd definitely come back again and recommend to friends to come and try the delicious pizzas at Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"Great fresh pizza! And fast! Always helpful and  fully staffed."}
{"text":"Is this the pizza version of casual fast food? I think so!!  Being tourist and looking to grab food prior to the trek to the airport, my sister and I wandered in. We somehow stumbled upon an awesome Chipotle style treat that we didn't know about.  Pizza: Ordering the Meatlovers to satisfy my cravings, my sister wanted some vegetables. Allowed to add vegetables and other toppings for free, we suddenly had a new pizza with the meats, pineapple, bacon, mushrooms, artichokes...... you get the picture!  Any other pizza joint, this is probably a $12 pizza as we get upcharged for each additional topping but here - $8 baby!  Staff: Grant it, we walked in at 10:20AM and they were preparing for the lunch time rush, but the staff was apathetic and not too eager to serve us. To make sure things were done evenly, they literally negotiated before we ordered about who will prepare the pizza, cash us out, deliver the pizza."}
{"text":"Coming back over and over just because they have great fresh brewed iced tea selections!  Passion Fruit, Watermelon, Traditional Black.  Great iced tea!  Yeah!!!  Pizza crust is way to thin but it was good and the ingredients you build your own pizza with were very good.  So overall I would come back."}
{"text":"Great idea and concept! It's like a chipotle or subway for your pizza! And with Amazing Gluten free crust, it's awesome! Only Drawback is it's loud! Prepare yourself to not be able to hear your family talk, or to hear yourself think. So great food, pricing is great $7.95 for a pizza with 6 slices and no limit to toppings. They also have a good salad selection. I would go back, but probably just get it to go next time."}
{"text":"Great pizza, stopped over while I was at a convention in Phoenix and was throughly impressed with the food . Made my own pizza and loved it . Going back again tonight . Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a reasonable price. You guys just need to clean your ovens better due to those little burnt crumbs from others pizzas that get on the newer pizzas. Other than that keep up the great food & friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was great, but I was not happy with the level of customer service I received. One of the girls on the line making my pizza got snappy with me because I had accidentally forgotten to mention my salad when I first got up to order, even though I had realized my error and apologized for doing so. Ordered a pizza and a spicy southwest salad, and the salad was missing the chicken (one of the main ingredients) and several other toppings. May come back here again, but I am not sure."}
{"text":"We tried out Fired Pie last night for the first time. My family and I loved it! Great topping choices, fresh ingredients and a nice staff. Food was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Pizza's and salads are awesome.  The veggies are so fresh.  The service is very professional and the place is clean.  Mos def recommended them."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best pizza I have ever had! The vegan herb crust is amazing! And the service is friendly and super great! Love this place. Great Manager Mark."}
{"text":"What you've heard is true!! Amazing salads and pizzas. The staff seems so happy to work there and be hands on. They take great pride in the food themselves :). Loved that I could build my own pizza with dozens of topping choices, including the meats and cheeses ! This is the place for me! I love different types of salami, chicken and sausages...there's no \"typical\" only offered here!  Delicious :)"}
{"text":"My mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, spicy sausage, and chicken pizza was cooked perfectly, chewy and crispy with no sogginess!  I asked for a drizzle of (runny and light-colored) balsamic on top after it was finished, and while a bit too watery, it definitely added to the flavor.  The spicy sausage does have a kick that hits you after, but it was manageable, and I don't care for spicy food in general.  $9.12 after tax makes this a great choice worth the small wait while they bake the pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday at Northsight venue based on Yelp reviews. Pizza is made to order and you can pile on all kinds of wonderful veggies after you choose your meat (if you want). Pizza crust is thin and crispy-awesome. Small salad was generous and a perfect complement.  It has an industrial chic meets fast food vibe. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite! My fiance and I discovered a place in Vegas that's called project pie and we fell in love instantly we went back everyday for lunch while we were there, I discovered this place from getting it for lunch at work one day and ran home to tell my husband cause it was just like project pie! We found this location closer to our house and have gone several times since then. If the oven at this place was a brick oven it would be exactly like project pie but this is the closest. There sauce is tasty compared to other pizza places I have eaten at. Perfect amount of toppings overall a great casual place to eat. You should check it out and hopefully like it as much as my fiance and I do."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've been waiting to try this place and I am so happy we finally have a location on the west side! The crust is excellent and they have a great selection of toppings. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"It was amazing , we had the chicken pesto pizza with extra chicken. Atmosphere was cool and relaxed , service was quick and accurate. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love fired pie. It's always a great day when I treat myself to FP. The assembly line pizza concept. The price point is unbeatable, and you don't have to settle for the toppings your group wants. Plus the crust is the perfect thickness and crispness. Try mixing the mozzarella with the buffalo mozzarella. And load up the toppings because they are unlimited. Yum."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Fired Pie--we heard about the 3.14 Pi Day special on Facebook from friends--so we decided to pop by after a date to the movies (about 1/2 the price of a pizza normally).   If you like thin crust pizza, you'll enjoy Fired Pie. This is absolutely not a deep dish sorta pizza place--and if you're looking for a huge portion, you may want to go somewhere else. That said, you do get to customize your own pizza and there is a decent sauce list and ingredients list to choose from. We both really enjoyed our pizzas, and we may come back as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious pies. Value for money. Tastier than all the delivery pizza places we have."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Friendly staff, delicious pizza. Wish the girl putting toppings on would switch her gloves every pizza tho."}
{"text":"Fired Pie-what happened?  I've been singing your praises and you let me down today with a soggy pie.    Other than the edges, the entire crust was soggy.  The cheese was not melted in the middle.  Really a mediocre job."}
{"text":"I order a pizza and Caesar salad from fired pie through Uber eats. First of all the pizza was very cold which is definitely on Uber, but, the pizza was so incredibly thin that you could see through it. I love thin pizza but that is ridiculous. The cheese was pretty much nonexistent. At least the Caesar salad looks good. I definitely won't be ordering through Uber eats again.   UPDATE.... The customer service at fired pie handled the situation very well. I am very impressed that they took the time to email me. I appreciate them fixing the situation and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Just finished up having lunch here for the first time.  We walked right up to the counter with no wait (11:30am on a Tuesday) and the staff were incredibly helpful in explaining the ordering process. I went with a custom salad and added all kinds of goodies. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, i just wish it was cut into smaller pieces.  The Italian dressing was really good and automatically comes on the side! The portion sizes are huge and a great value for just over $7.00 including unlimited toppings. The patio was perfect and the salad was delivered to our table within minutes. Next time I need to try one of their pizzas which looked great too!"}
{"text":"Yes! This place is awesome! My wife and I have been to several build your own pizza places, and this one is the best so far because of the wood fire crust. I need to go out right now and buy a wood fired oven. :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and it's always been pretty good. However, this time I ordered the same basic pizza tomato basil. I got home with my pizza and there was so much cheese on it, that it was flopping over the side and the flimsy crust couldn't even hold it. It was gross. That's not the worst part! The worst part is I got an intestinal virus from this pizza. I'm thinking it was the cheese no doubt!  I don't even want to describe stomach issues I suffered. It is a shame because I was a big fan of this place.  I don't think I will be going back. this was the only thing I ate that day so I know it was the pizza. Of course it is possible to get sick from any restaurant and that's why I can't stand eating out! Try it if you dare!"}
{"text":"After a couple months of my mother raving over Fired Pie, I had to try the place out for myself.  The first time I went to Fired Pie was on my birthday and the line was nearly out the door (always a good sign).  The price isn't bad at all and they whip the pizzas out in no time.  I had the steak & blue and it was absolutely delicious.  I loved everything on it from the steak & gorgonzola cheese to the crispy, thin crust flavored with garlic.  The next time I went, I ordered what's now my favorite: the meaty Italian with artichokes, gorgonzola and fresh basil added on.  My pie hadn't even been fired yet, but it looked and sounded so good that the lady next to me in line said, \"I'll have what he's having\".  I haven't been back for a over a month, and I think I need my fix.  This pizza is just too damn good."}
{"text":"LOVVVVVVE me some fired pie. I can't stop getting the pizza with Alfredo, both mozzarellas, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and garlic. Try it and your tastebuds will thank you! Plus they have China mist iced tea which places any place in my top faves automatically.  as my coworker who I introduced to fired pie said: the chipotle of pizzas!"}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in the area. SO many options. All the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I've tried both the pizzas and the salads, you can't really go wrong! Tons of seating, friendly employees, the pizzas come out fast, and the prices are reasonable. Please come to Boston."}
{"text":"This is place is absolutely awesome! The food is delicious and the customer service is excellence! And you're looking for a vegan/gluten-free option they have that too! As a vegan, it's difficult finding resturant's that can accommodate my diet, but this place is definitely my new go to spot when I want a healthy feel-good pizza! And shot out to the manager Alfred who goes beyond the call of duty to make resturant guests feel like family! So glad this place is near home, because they will soon know me by name!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! First time here and wanted to try something new. Not disappointed at all. It's fun to customize your own pizza with deliciousness! Quoting my wife after her first bite from her pizza, \"this place is freakin' awesome!\""}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town (from Michigan) and we hand just landed and settled in.  We wanted to try something that we don't have back home, and for a lunch spot this looked like it fit the bill.  My wife ordered one of their recipe pies (Hawaiian) and I got a custom made pie (buffalo chicken with jalapenos).  They were AWESOME! The pies are thin crust so you don't feel uncomfortably full and it really hit the spot.  If you're not returning to work, they have a couple bottled local craft brews to partake in.  They also had several salad options that looked good as well, though we did not try any, if you're looking for a lighter lunch.  Overall, we were definitely glad we found the place!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good!  Custom orders of individual pizzas and a decent amount of toppings to choose from.  Plus they have beer and wine . This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly!  We go here at least 2x per month and we have a family of 6 .  I miss the frozen margaritas.  Please bring them back"}
{"text":"Love Love Love their GF Pizza and my family loves their regular pizza.. We go here at least once every two weeks. Their customer service is also awesome.."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, just like the Chandler location.  I got a Pesto Chicken with garlic oil & mushrooms added. Delicious! The crust was perfect, crispy with a little chew.  Servers are well-trained considering how recently it opened.  They're quick and friendly, I appreciate that.  We decided to eat outside today which was nice since it's a little breezy today. Great view of the mountain from here.  This location is my new go-to when I need a Fired Pie fix (that way I don't have to go downtown)!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch there yesterday, food toppings were very fresh, pizza was EXCELLENT!  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I really like wood fired pizzas. Not a fan of all of the fast food fired pizzas of the same concept but I do like Fired Pie. The toppings seem of better, fresh quality vs most canned options at other fired fast pizzas. Also I can go light & still feel like I'm having a cheat day & not be racked with guilt. I also like the salads for the same reason & I can get my dressings on the side & choose my toppings. My son likes them because he can get what he likes which is basically meat, pesto & cheese (he's pickier). The hubs likes he can have a meat frenzy & not ruin my pizza experience because it's his pizza. So it really works for our fam."}
{"text":"Love Pizza Me! Great local place and their Gluten Free crust is the best! They are also SUPER with fundraisers to help the community. My favorite pizza is the Medi-Veggie with gluten free crust."}
{"text":"It was a good meal for the price. Plus if you have a pizookie on the menu you have won me. Although it was a little small. But still a good pizza experience for how inexpensive it was. Plus you can be in and out quick if you need to be."}
{"text":"Just got finished eating my to-go order and boy was it amazing. I've kept hearing good things about this place and I finally got a chance to try it out. I ordered a Hawaiian bqq and added capicola meat and my sister got a custom tomatoe pesto with a variety of veggies. As I sat down waiting for my order, not even a minute later my pizzas were ready. Completely took me by surprise that it was baked so quickly. I love the chipotle style of service which makes each pizza unique. Only complaint is that they should have some sort of sign up labeling the selection of choices. I had no idea what the capicola was nor did I know some of the cheese choices. But after asking the staff, they were happy to explain. Would definitely recommend and eat here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way back to my hotel (visiting a client). I had read the other reviews on Yelp and thought it would be worth checking out. I have to say, I definitely was NOT disappointed.   I was able to not only choose my sauce, I could choose my cheeses (fresh mozzarella and Bleu cheese), the meat and the vegetables.   In less than five minutes,.the pizza was being delivered to my table. It was soooo good! Had I not been so full from eating my pizza, I would have ordered a second one.  The staff was so friendly and even joked around with my associate and me. I look forward to my return trip in September. I will definitely make it a point to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is the only interesting place to go after a long day shopping at tanger outlets. We are here on Saturdays and expected the crowd during lunch time but am happy to give them this review for their fast service and excellent response. Coming to the taste, you get for what you pay for and I love their concept of customizing on a flat rate.  I reduced a star because the tables are not clean and the maintenance staff are not around to call upon."}
{"text":"We came in the late afternoon to lunch here and it wasn't terribly busy. We got to take our time in looking over the menu and got great service from the young men preparing our food. The staff was patient, answered all of our questions and very friendly.  What I loved the most about this place was that it was a Chipotle but for pizza. What a great concept!  Had a delightful little feast at this location last week which consisted of two pizzas and a Caesar salad. We ordered the steak and blue and the Italian one with a regular sized Caesar. The salad was MORE than enough for two and was delish.  The best part of the meal was how the pizza arrived nice, piping hot and covered with enough toppings to make anyone happy. As far as the crust, next to Bella Gusto in Chandler, this is the second best crust in AZ.  All in all, it was a great meal and the only thing I noticed which could use improving was that it a little housekeeping needed to be attended to. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Ok I love pizza but have to eat gluten-free.  Even though super fast food type it is by far best gluten-free pizza. Trust me I try everywhere.  I love so many choices and so fast at a great price. Makes me happy!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad the one in Scottsdale makes an amazing gluten free pizza. This one wasn't cooked and super greasy in just didn't  taste good I'm so surprised of the big difference. Bummer"}
{"text":"Create your own custom fired pizza, what's not to love? Service was great and this is obviously a hoppin spot. We arrived around 10:50, and perfect timing because we had just sat down to wait for our food when the line started wrapping all the way around. Fresh toppings, flavorful crust, with just a little bit of burnt crispiness that you expect with fire pizza, just the right amount. Not to mention for two people, (two pizzas & two drinks) it was under $20 and we had tons of leftovers."}
{"text":"Really fun and just good. Combos make or break it so just be careful and don't choose something weird"}
{"text":"Great pies and lil' salads!! The staff provides great customer service and recommendations."}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza! If you haven't been it's like a subway for pizza but way tastier! The food is always on point but sometimes the stay here is lacking. They seem like they don't care and there's always several staff but they don't all appear to be doing anything and are zoning out. But if you go just for the food...you will be very pleased!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for pizza. It is cheap, fast and so good. I have heard of this place for a while but never tried it. Even knew this location opened down the street from me. I was craving pizza the other night and good ol' Yelp pointed out that this place was down the street. Time to give it a try. So off I went. The place isn't huge but it is nice. Quite a few tables scattered around. Even though the line was to the door it moved pretty quickly. The dough is pre-prepared on boards behind the first employee in the line. They reach back and grab one and start your pizza. You start with the sauce and cheese. They have multiple kinds of both. You can create your own pizza or get one of their recipes. In my opinion true pizza is dough, sauce and cheese. That's it. Put anything else on there and it turns into a sandwich. But that is just my opinion. They have a ton of toppings and you can load up your pizza as much as you want all for only $8. That is a great deal. The pizzas are thin crust which is how they bake so fast once the go in the huge oven behind the prep line. All of the employees were very nice. The store was neat and clean. The line moved very well and even after you got out of line you didn't have to wait too long for your pizza. You can get it to go or stay and eat. They have one size. 11 inches. Which I think is perfect for a individual serving. Plus it's pizza you can always finish off the rest cold in the morning. My pizza didn't make it to the morning. It was so good I chowed down on the whole thing in one sitting.  I will definitely be back. In fact I almost went right back the next day. I'm still craving it. It's a great idea and very well executed. When I want cheap fast pizza, which is a lot, I will return. Much better than $5 pizza from that other place. Good job Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. It's like the subway of pizza. The pizza was mediocre and the sauce taste like plain ol tomatoe sauce, no flavor at all."}
{"text":"Well, first of all, it's not pizza, though it is a healthier option than fast food. It's a step above Domino's, but not by much. By no means does it deserve anywhere near four stars.   Went in on Saturday night and the place was run by about 12 teenagers. Really hope there was a grown up somewhere in the back...  The assembly line concept is okay, but not when ingredients start to get mixed in with others. Maybe that's because the kids were throwing food at each other. One girl was wearing gloves, but then adjusted her hat and didn't think to put new ones on. That's lovely. And another, who wasn't wearing gloves was replenishing the pepperoni with more and took the last remaining ones out of the old container with her ungloved hand. Gloves for a reason, girls.   No need to visit. CHAR has set the standard for make your own pies. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch, and didn't really know what to expect. I got there, and felt like I was at Which Wich. I ordered a pizza, and it was basically built right in front of me. Then, before I know it, I was eating. It took me less than 30 minutes to order and eat on a busy day at noon. I have only been once, but I will be back. This place rocks. Oh, and their salads are HUGE! The pizzas are all personal pan, but I can see myself going with a date and getting a salad and a pizza. Maybe a bottle of beer, too. I love it. Cheers to a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best gluten-free pizza hands down! I've tried them all lol. And for a great price too, even with gluten-free up charge.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is getting 5 stars because of it's simply awesomeness! The food of course is delicious. The prices are reasonable and the staff??? WOW!!! Super friendly! Full of life! And they know how to smile! And laugh! I will be coming back to this location and will highly be recommending them to all friends and family."}
{"text":"Cool concept for pizza quick and easy. You can add as many toppings as you  want for all the same prices."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time , I loved that you could pick any toppings you'd like for the same price . Size of the pizza was great , but the quality of the toppings wasn't the best . By biggest concern was the cleanliness of this place especially since they weren't very busy . They definitely need to work on their cleaning!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at very reasonable price. Thin crust pizza with anything you want on it. This was my 5th trip to this location. Great pizza, fresh, fast and cheap. The salads look great too, though I did not try any."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on our visit here today ! Seemed like they were annoyed , place was dirty trash was full, out of sweeteners for tea and when we asked it was a very rude comment back ! Never have issues before but next time we will go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Very chaotic. Too many people behind counter walking around doing nothing. Pizza was fair but pricey"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Phoenix from Dallas and I thought I'd give this FiredPie a try. I'm definitely glad I did I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and added jalapeños The only problem was I asked for extra spinach and you can see by the photo with their idea of extra means also  they were out of sun-dried tomatoes and I was really looking forward to them. The total was $9.62 which I felt was a little much given the size of the pizza but I am from Texas so maybe I'm just used to bigger things overall I would come back and hopefully they have sun-dried tomatoes by then."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, they make it right in front of you...It's a little pricey for what you get, but it is delicious.."}
{"text":"Great service and even greater good. Fresh and delicious! Not to mention they are much healthier than Dominoes"}
{"text":"Awesome little place for a quick pizza or salad.  And inexpensive too!  This place has a list of toppings sauces and salad dressings and you can make your pizza or salad based off any combination, and I do mean any, of them.    I had a friend order a pizza with ranch as the sauce, it was weird but they made it.  The salads have several options for lettuce as well.    The staff has always been friendly on my visits, even though they are all hurrying to get the meals done.    This is a great place to go with a large group that needs to eat fast or one with picky eaters.    The line is fast, there are a ton of options and it doesn't cost that much."}
{"text":"I got threw the line fairly quickly after waiting about 15 minutes I finally got my Pizza I got into my car and decided I wanted to try it hot well it wasn't hot anymore it sat on the counter for a long time before they started passing out pizzas to all the other customers there was many people working so I'm not sure why it took so long for them to pass out the pizzas before they got cold the flavor of the pizza was good I do think the crust could be a tad bit thicker considering it said hand toss dough and not thin dough"}
{"text":"Went here after friends raved about the place, even though they know how picky I am. Nothing special. Another one of those order, sit and they bring food to you places. Simple menu. Concept of the one price pie is good, but the pizza was blah. It was the fruit flies that were most annoying. No need to come here again. If I need a place between fast food and restaurant, I'll go to Sauce."}
{"text":"A huge YES! for this place. Order the pizza , just the way you like it. I am not the only one who thinks that way, because on the cool days, the line sometimes goes out the door. I love my Alfredo base and all veggies. My  favorite combination of veggies. Create your fantasy pizza here. Love it and come back...just a warning...You'll eat it all..in one sitting. Just don't count calories that day...just enjoy."}
{"text":"So glad I live right down the street!  Delicious, fresh, made-to-order pizza. I hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"I liked the concept, but found the product mediocre. For example, I was excited to try the steak & blue salad, but the \"steak\" was dry and crumbled, not sliced meat as I was expecting.  They offer GF crust, but there's plenty of cross-contamination and the staff makes no effort to know or check on the ingredients in the toppings (like the meats). If you're truly gluten-sensitive, skip it."}
{"text":"Friendly service, super clean, great value and -- most importantly, yummy thin-crust wood-fired pizza. Lots of options for toppings without extra charge. My new go-to place for pizza cravings."}
{"text":"It's a great place for pizza cause it's not expensive and you can decide what you want on your pizza. So it's like Subway in a way."}
{"text":"My kids go \"ga ga\" for this place :) They love that they can build their own personal pizza with all the toppings they want for one price. Although we learned that because the crust is thin, if you add more than 4-5 toppings, the pizza becomes a bit soggy :( We've also ordered their salads, which are good too, but my recommendation is to ask for dressing on the side unless you like it heavy.  We come here often, as well as the Ahwatukee location, and both are consistently good. Try it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, and it is priced fair. The customer service is a little hit and miss, but not too bad."}
{"text":"Fast and amazing may good pizza! Set up like a chipotle where you see all the ingredients in front of you to pick from and then they pop it in the oven.  Only takes about 5-7 mins and then your good to go.  The line is always fairly long cause there is only one oven and one register but not the end of the world"}
{"text":"This is a 'Make your own Pizza' place which off late have sprung up everywhere. The pizza as such is very good and you can build your own. I'll give Pieology a slight edge over Fired Pie because of the wide and fresh topping selection but overall a good Pizza place. They have fresh mozzarella which is good on the pizza. Definitely worth trying and you would like the pizza."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fire oven pizza on this side of town.  The best thing about eating here has to be that you can put whatever you want on your pizza and it still costs the same.  They have pretty much every topping you can think of and they construct your 11\" pizza right there with as little or as much as you can handle. Even the \"premium\" toppings others charge more for ( Kalamata olives Mmmmmm). The food is usually really fast even when they are kinda backed up which is nice when you are running out for a quick dinner.  The only slightly wonky thing is the way they mark your pizza on the papers.  This seems pretty straight forward, but when they get busy it sometimes becomes a bit hectic and you need to go check on your pizza.  That's only a minor quibble though.  They have been really nice when it has happened and even gave us a free pizza cookie coupon.  It's a pretty new place though so it will probably get all figured out as they go.    Try: - Pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza that you customize yourself, but it's made for you and ready to eat in a couple of minutes? YES PLEASE PIZZA ME!!  My friend Carl describes Pizza Me as the subways of pizza. Pick all your toppings and they basically make it right in front of you. I am not a pizza lover at all. I never claimed to be one. But this place has me sold!  I for one love the thin crust it comes on. If it helps them cook it faster and get it out to my mouth quicker, I'm all for that. If you aren't sure what combinations you want, you can always just go with one of their signature pizzas or see what the specials are that day. I love the alfredo sauce pizza. Drool. It really is amazing.  Tip: If you aren't that hungry, you can make any pizza a \"mini me\" which is the perfect kids size/appetizer that won't make you too full to move after.  Oh I totally forgot to tell you pizza's best friend BEER is here too!! You can't have one without the other!!  Great service, super friendly and clean, and your pizza and beer are ready in minutes. What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Design your own quality, personal sized pizza! I absolutely love pizza, my wife, well, not so much. The exception is this place. She loves it! Perfect compromise. :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled across this place while out and about last weekend.  For under 8 bucks you get an 11 inch thin crust pizza any way you want it. It's like the Burger King of Pizza but with much better ingredients and all around product! I had the Pesto Chicken and hubs had the all meat. They load on the toppings! You definitely get your money's worth. I really liked the thin crust. I thought it had good flavor and it was crispy but not so crispy you chip a tooth. Wish there was one closer to my side of town. Next time I'm back in N. Scottsdale I'll be back for more ;)"}
{"text":"Come here often and the food is always great!!! It would be nice if the owner thought about installing some shades on the booth side of the restaurant to open up more seating during the hot time of day! Love us some good pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is verrrrrry small. You walk through the line choose your toppings its cooked in front of you."}
{"text":"The custom made pizza is amazing! Great sauce and toppings options all included in the price of the pizza, they don't charge extra for each topping. I also love their Watermelon tea. My family loves this place - we eat here often! Good food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was friendly, specific and you could tell they enjoyed their job. This place definitely has a wonderful concept of how to build your own pie. My husband and I split the Pesto Chicken Pizza and it was delish! Though we had never tried this place before today we wanted to be daring and decided to add a few more ingredients for our taste buds (spinach, bacon, & sweet pepper blend) and didn't regret it a bit. We definitely recommend Fired Pie! :)"}
{"text":"Of course it was great! I created it myself! Love the concept. Veggies and toppings fresh and plenty of options.  Just one thing...I'm from the Carolinas, if you're going to offer unsweet tea...label it as such"}
{"text":"Most importantly it's a very delicious pizza and for the price you are getting really good ingredients so as four stars suggests, I am a fan.  However, the wait time can be a bit much around dinner time, and for some odd reason the pizza gets very soggy if you take it to go. My best recommendation is to come for lunch and dine-in."}
{"text":"Really great lunch place! The roasted veggie salad was very enjoyable and the pizza crust was perfectly done to my liking of crispy and crunchy without being burnt."}
{"text":"We may have just hit this at the wrong time, but we ate on a busy Saturday afternoon and encountered somewhat clueless staff and a very dirty dining room. I like the concept but the execution was poor. Our pizzas were greasy and the crust surprisingly limp. Hopefully these are all growing pains and training issues and the place improves. Nearly $50 for a family of 4 to eat pizza is a bit outrageous. A child sized pie would be a wonderful addition. We may try again, but we will be waiting a while."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I arrived at 905pm thinking it closed at 930. But that's only on weekends. HOWEVER, when we walked in the mgr said \"no problem\" what can I make you?. Now that's customer service with a smile. We ordered our stuff, he even went out of his way to fry up some spinach that my wife wanted as they had tossed out the days supply already.  We ate on the patio,- as soon as we sat the lights were turned back on and the mgr brought out a candle for the table. That was above and beyond. Music came back on. We ate very comfortably and never felt rushed, even though they were closed when we arrived. In this day and age you don't find that service often and we commend the Manager highly for his extraordinary way of working. Kudos to him and his staff. Unfortunately we didn't get his name.(Late 20s, early 30s, tattoos). Yah I know that's everyone these days but we wanted him to know that we recognized his energy and enthusiasm."}
{"text":"After shopping at Tanger outlets. On Saturdays and Sundays This is the only interesting place to go and have an inexpensive meal with the family, friends or your significant other, how ever during lunch time there tends to be a bit of a crowd  but am happy to give them this review for their fast service and excellent response. Coming to the taste, you get for what you pay for  especially since you decide what you want and what control what you get.....Just Saying!!"}
{"text":"So good!! My kids are gluten free and this place has great gf crust! Salads are really big and super tasty. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a number of times now and have been consistently impressed by the restaurant's cleanliness, the quality and taste of the food, and the friendliness of the staff.  While they have salads that look delicious, I have never made it past the pizza for my main course. My favorite is the Pesto Chicken pizza, but I've had many others and all have been delicious. My husband's favorite part of the pizza here is the crust. It is delicious and just the right texture.  For dessert, their pizza cookie is heavenly if you've still got room after you inhale your pie. Try this place- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pies to go, and each was done very well. The fresh mozzarella with tomato sauce and basil, a pesto sauce pie, and a regular mozz with red sauce.  The sauces were tasty, cheese was of good quality, and I like the thin crispy crust. Pizzas came out super fast and the service was very pleasant. I could see eating these!"}
{"text":"First time there and i was totally impressed by their selection and their quick service. Love the fact that there is no up charge for each ingredient like in traditional pizza places. I also love that all i had to tell the server to add all the veggies and she did yey all for the same price"}
{"text":"Although the employees were not so enthusiastic, they were still incredibly kind and helpful. The food is amazing. I love the design. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is just a chain of the new pizza places kinda like Blaze Pizza... pizza was really good, fresh and crispy and the the ingredients on top were good as well! Very dark inside at night I would say but overall a good atmosphere for a quick bite to eat. Prices are OK too for a restaurant pizza made to your liking... you get what you pay for is my moto!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have great employees and always go beyond when making your food! Enjoy going to eat here !"}
{"text":"Ordered a meaty Italian, pizookie, and a custom with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, buffalo chicken, onion, tomatoes and jalapenos. The crust is thin and crispy. The restaurant is set up to choose a sauce, meat and toppings. Very efficient set up. The pizookie is about the size of a palm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. The cookie first came out a bit overcooked and they immediately made me another one. Good service and food!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here!!!! If you like a thin crispy crust this is the place for you!  The unlimited toppings with no extra charge is a plus as well.  Prices are reasonable and staff is always helpful when you can't decide what to pick :)   My new fav place!"}
{"text":"Ordered Steak and Blue salad--definitely not impressed and don't recommend.  Tasteless with ground up steak bits, barely recognizable as meat."}
{"text":"I love thin crust and this is heaven. Great prices and great service..... I'm a pizza obesser...... Its hard to find great pizza but I'm glad I found here..."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying fired pie and it won't be my last. Fired Pie is like a chipotle concept for pizza. You pick your own sauces, cheeses and toppings. Pricing was about $8 a pizza.   Most of all- I was quite surprised about the taste. I thought I was going to get a little Caesar/Peter piper pizza since it was a quick service concept restaurant, but actually it was awesome. Ingredients were fresh, and pizza cooked perfectly. The dough was ok- crust was a bit dry, but didn't take away from the great flavor.   The reason I took a star away was for annoyance of the line (or lack thereof).  The menu is an an awkward place and so people are having to try and look over at it while they order. Put an additional menu above the ordering area, and create a more recognizable queue system, and I'd be less stressed when ordering my delicious pizza.   I'll definitely be back, especially since I don't eat pork and my husband does. This makes it easy for us to both be happy- no arguing or trying to figure out which half of the pizza doesn't have bits of ham or bacon.   My first pizza creation was pesto sauce, mozzarella and feta cheese, with artichoke, kalamata olives, and garlic. Try it!"}
{"text":"Love this place and SO happy there is one near us now!!! Best pie ever!!!  Customer service was great also!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place with just one visit.  The staff runs pretty efficiently in making your personally-selected ingredients and bringing it out to you quickly.  They have good combinations or you can build-your-own.  I had the chicken pesto and they were plentiful with all ingredients.. my son and I enjoyed every bite and I look forward to visiting here again."}
{"text":"Exploring downtown Phoenix with my family and then we came to that time where everyone is tired and hungry. We walked to go to see if any of the pizza places around was any good. I've heard Fired Pie was good so we went here after finding out the first pizza place we wanted to try was closed. Then, with some hesitation we decided to eat here...we had an option to just go home and order pizza haha.   Well I'm glad we didn't...this place was awesome!  It's like a chipotle style restaurant but for pizza. The pizza's were about 11 inches in diameter and they give you unlimited toppings. There's set recipes too where you can choose from...which is what we did and added a little bit more stuff (It is unlimited toppings for the same charge!!!)  The pizza was delicious and it was only 7.95 plus tax for pizza (which is thin crust by the way). This is a great way to enjoy pizza with however you want your toppings and they were delicious!!!!  I would def come back! It's great for big families or groups!"}
{"text":"So happy we ate in this time. Shared a gluten free mahgarita pizza with my daughter. Filling and delicious. Wonderful customer service! Each person we encountered was so kind. Love all the families coming in what a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have to say, I didn't have high expectations for a build-your-own pizza place.  Seemed gimmicky...until I got there and saw all my options...  Excellent pie and unbelievably quick to the table!  Fresh ingredients, loved the crust, perfectly crispy thin crust.  The setup is kind of like Chipotle (assembly-line) and I like that you get to see what's going on your pizza as it's being assembled.  An 11\" pie for $7.75...can't beat that!  Add to that a pizookie (oven baked cookie/ice cream) for dessert and you will be comfortably satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of those hidden gems in downtown phoenix.  I was on a business trip and pizza sounded good, and to my surprise you can customize your own pizza for under $8 with a whole array of toppings, and not just your typical pizza toppings. Once you pick your toppings one by one the person behind the counter pops it in the oven and about 5 minutes later its ready to go.   I would make a suggestion to the owner and have your menu with cheese, toppings, sauces, etc, on a board behind the counter so that the options are listed.  With so many cheeses, meats, and veggie toppings its a little hard to identify what each item is.   Overall I think the inside and outside of the restaurant could be a little more tidy, tables lined up, and cleaned off but I'm sure this is a busy place when there is an event going on at the nearby stadiums."}
{"text":"love this place so much!!! the owner is so kind and all the workers make the best pizza i've ever had. hope this place goes big because the idea is great and their product is delicious!!! 7.75 for an 11\" pizza is a steal! def recommend for pizza lovers and all you hungry peeps :)"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location frequently.  The staff were always friendly, helpful and generous.  I usually order a \"Fired Pie Italian Salad\".  I loved the fact that they would load the salad with meat, and you can specialize other toppings.  Up until today....  I visited late in the day, ordered the usual salad, and watched as the person preparing the food placed about 1/3 of the usual amount of sliced meats on the salad, added ingredients I didn't order, and skimped on the others that I did.  While the food was fast, and still tasted OK, it just wasn't the same.  the mix of ingredients, meats and dressing, did the flavors no justice.  They have provided better.  I have enjoyed better!    I understand this location is under new management.  It shows in the lack of inspiration and the fact that the staff seems like they now really don't enjoy their work.  Too bad.  They had a good thing."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. LOOOOVVVEEEEE IT.   It's so simple, and super great that you can either build your own or choose one that's already built (I.e. The margarita pizza. Drool).   Whenever I want to have a pizza and wine night, I hit up Fried Pie. It is thin crust pizza so it's super delicious without feeling as though you gorged yourself. A lot of these reviews say it's like subway but that's totally not true. Yes, it's build your own, but not even remotely close to a chain like that.   Eat here. Do it. Do it. Do it."}
{"text":"After just my first visit to Fired Pie, I can definitively say that I'm going to be a huge supporter of this establishment!! Although I was a little bit uncertain about what to expect, I was very impressed by the choices that awaited me as I got in line.  I started off the pizza with olive oil and garlic & pesto sauce. I then asked for it to be topped it off with mozzarella cheese, BBQ chicken, sautéed onions, sautéed green peppers, lots of mushrooms, sautéed spinach and some pepperoncinis.  [[Silly me on the pepperoncinis, I'm not a huge fan so I'm not sure why I got them on there but no matter, I picked them off.]]  Everything else tasted so good! The pizza came out really quickly & the cheese was oozing and all my favorite toppings were to be found! I did opt to get the sautéed onions instead of the raw ones - the one thing I regret. And also, I got the sautéed green peppers but I think it would've been nice to have a raw green pepper option. I'm not sure what they use to sauté the peppers but they were slightly on the sour side, a bit off-putting. I'd leave them off next time but otherwise, I was really pleased with the pizza!  The service was really good & the price for what you get was fair. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, surprisingly this was great! I was a bit skeptical at first because although I love pizza, I am a bit particular. This place was not so bad at all especially for the kind of place they are. What a great concept of putting whatever you like onto your pizza and have it made right before you.   I love the thin crispy crust, it's absolutely delicious and just talking about this place makes me crave some. I can eat a whole thing to myself in one sitting, so portion depends on the person and lifestyle.   The last time I went the person who was taking my order was a bit weird and kept saying how I must really like spicy. I mean he said this more then 3 times. All I got was the buffalo chicken pizza. It wasn't spicy but yes I do like spicy foods but I also like the taste of buffalo sauce :)   Check them out! Give them a try."}
{"text":"Fired Pie stands at the top of the build-your-own pizza chains for me because of their red sauce. It is hands down one of the best pizza sauces in the business. The freshness of their ingredients and this sauce make them my favorite."}
{"text":"My favorite fast casual pizza place! Amazing every single time. The buffalo chicken salad, the cheese pizza with fresh mozzarella and the steak and blue are my faves."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Average service. Average menu. Yes, seems like the Chipotle of pizza places except with a slower line."}
{"text":"This place is a great idea.  The pizza is at a great price.  This place is great if you have people that can not agree on ingredients.  This weekend my mom and I split a pepperoni pizza.  My sister and niece had a cheese.  The pizza is pretty good too.  Like I said if you are in a hurry and have kids.  This is the place to go.  Pizzas are served quick and there is a selection of toppings."}
{"text":"They had a Fathers Day special deal in the paper. My Mom, Dad and I went in for lunch. The deal was buy a meal and get a free meal for dad. We did not get the deal. When we asked we were informed that you have too ask for the special too get it. Apparently it's some kind of secret deal and we didn't know the secret handshake.  The employees were kind of put in a bad spot because they weren't able to rectify his problem. Management needs too do a better job.  The food and service was good. It's to bad a stupid thing like this brings down their rating today. Happy fathers day."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Fired Pie.  The pizza was fabulous with a super thin crust and the salad was generous.  $22 for lunch downtown is a deal... Great place to go before a ball game.  Eat here and take the light rail to the game."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of pizzas but I wanted to give this place a try. With an excellent concept of customizing your pizza with a number of ways(way more than traditional) and have it on a fresh, thin bread, this place is a must try for everyone. The 11 inch pizza was perfect for lunch and worth every penny of the 7.95 I spent on it."}
{"text":"\"Fired Pie\" is trying to be the Subway or Chipotle for Pizzas and Salads. From the looks of it, they're slowly on their way.  I've only been there once, and really enjoyed their Steak & Bleu salad.  Huge portion for not that huge of a pricetag, made quickly and pretty darn healthy, too!  I was literally the only customer when I was there, but I'm guessing it's popular based on the Yelp reviews and the many locations that have popped up.    I'm excited to return and try a pizza.   Based on my first visit, I definitely recommend you checking it out. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Im a first timer. I think this place was great the crust was my favorite part!! I ordered a pizza that was on the menu, I'm not sure of the name, but I know it was all vegetables. It was delicious, the only thing I would change is to ADD more sauce. I love saucy pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place... The food is fresh, fast, and the biggest salad you can get for $8.95 :) I love how you can customize everything (with a lot of choices) and because I'm gluten intolerant they are always really great about changing gloves for me.   Love it!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for pizza!  All pizzas are made fresh when ordered & can order as many toppings as you want!  Thank you Yelp for helping us find Fired Pie years ago!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is never soggy regardless of how many toppings that you get, it is always crispy as well and never burnt or under cooked. Overall a great deal if you want some fantastic pizza in the Downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Really good pizza!  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Place was clean. We'll go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely not up to other fired pie's standards. Lemonades are pure sugar. Girl who makes the pizzas is rude and not friendly at all. Don't have all the topping and choices as others fired pies. Won't come again and won't recommend this location.."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place. The food is great and the location means we can walk off the calories! The custom made pizzas make it easy to like their food. Plus, they serve alcohol. Only gripe is that it gets full on weekends and there's not many seats inside. If you go on a slow day, there's no problem with lines and seating."}
{"text":"amazing pizza amazing staff awesome build your own subway style for $7.75 u get a personal pizza with unlimited toppings and amazing taste if your in the area check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This is a heavy rotation item on the revolving wheel of locations on my \"eat lunch with coworkers\" list. I like the concept. Sorta like Chipotle for pizza. You can make your pizza exactly as your heart desires. You choose all your ingredients and they bake the pizza for you. As far as I recall, no matter what you add, price doesn't change. Lately I've actually been getting less ingredients because it is a lot of food for one sitting. Crust is really thin. Sometimes it gets a little burnt but for the most part they got it right the dozen or so times I've been here. Management even bent over backwards a few times I've been here when a coworker's pizza didn't come out exactly the way they ordered it. The idea is pretty damn good and I would be very surprised if they don't open more locations in the near future. Located in the Raintree Ranch mall at the southeast corner of Ray and North Price Road in a clusterfork of a mall designed by dyslexic insomniacs on peyote. I've been to the same location once before in it's previous life as Luke's Of Chicago with the same bunch of coworkers who all decided that the food was pretty much meh except for their onion rings - which were awesome. Unfortunately onion rings alone couldn't keep the place in business - but that's actually a win for the rest of us as well as for the folks who work at that Fired Pie location. :)"}
{"text":"I like the concept. The pizza was good. I had the chicken pesto. The layout of the place was awkward though and the customer service was not that great."}
{"text":"To get full i would have to eat 4 of these litte pizzas. tasted good, for a thin crust."}
{"text":"New Name.  Still Great Taste.  My wife and I were sad to see Pizza Me go out of business, but were pleased to see Fired Pie take over so quickly.    The Pizzas and Salads are great.  I really enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Caesar Salad.    I love the dog-friendly patio, and the staff is both friendly and fast.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"love it.  So good and reasonably priced.  Staff is super friendly and work fast despite being really busy."}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, delicious, and what a variety of sauces and toppings. Great personal pizzas"}
{"text":"1. They rushed us through the ordering process despite the fact there was no one behind us in the empty restaurant. 2. We were in a bit of a rush and they messed up our pizza and had to redo it. We asked for a pizookie for having to wait but they declined.  Overall, bad customer service. This place should learn from the people at the Scottsdale Quarter Fired Pie.  I gave a star for the pizza because it tasted great."}
{"text":"Stunned I loved this place.  It's the subway of pizza places but awesome.  The pizzas are crazy flavorful, no limit to your toppings.  Definately coming back, also very affordable: two pizzas, a small salad, Apple juice and a drink for 22 dollars."}
{"text":"Friendly, flavorful, Fast, and Fun, but enough with the alliteration. Fired Pie is a gem. Great prices on good, no ,make that wonderful pizza.  The salad choices are good and show someone wanted a salad menu that was above the norm. The buffalo chicken salad  is my favorite. And when you think you've had about every combination of pizza, you haven't begun. They let you pick your own combination from the top quality toppings. Go to Fired Pie, you will return again and again."}
{"text":"my favorite of all time make your own pizza place just a awesome place to pick and choose what you want and make it fresh with there brick oven just love the topping selection they have and the flavor it brings out of it just a great place for good pizza"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place. Every location is pretty consistent so I'm a fan. Love the thin crispy crust and the China Mist Iced tea is my absolute favorite!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands... Completely empty with 5 employees behind the counter.   No hello.  Okay...    Now I'm back to order pizza.  They were training 2 maybe 3 young girls.   The lady in front of me is making some crazy pizza and salad.   It's totally throwing the trainees for a loop.    Finally a manager steps in to help the trainees. And thankfully another helps me.   Great!  I order a pesto chicken pizza.   This is a standard pie for them.   Super, he makes it and... then I wait while the lady in front continues her order and mass confusion.   Why don't they throw my pizza in the oven?  I find this odd.     Finally I pay and wait.  There are no knives only forks, watermelon tea is out with a cup placed over it.   And the soda/ ice machine is spitting ice onto the floor.   There are ripped pizza boxes on the floor and 1/3 of the tables are dirty... Ugh.   I like the food at this place and usually they are efficient.  But if they are training this way... It's not gonna get better."}
{"text":"Now when I want a good pizza for lunch I have a choice between Sauce and Fired Pie. Nice and fast, located in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square. The pizza is very tasty and the salads are good as well, If you're looking for a quick meal, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Wanted to be creative and this is the time and the right place to be if you feel like eating healthy food affordable meal"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a great little joint that feels like they care  what goes into their food. Herbivores and carnivores alike can find something they like, whether it be a pizza or a salad.  Pizza comes thin, but not completely crunchy. I actually prefer thick pizza, but this place is a very happy medium on the crunch level.  I think it is best to just order a pizza by selecting toppings as you go, much in the same way you would order at Subway. I do think that adding olive oil to the crust is pretty awesome.  Place can get pretty busy!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yeah... Ima fan. Fresh, delicious, inventive, and of course woodfired.  Also I love the fact that the pizzas are 7.99 no matter if you have one topping, no topping or 85 toppings. The 4 parking spaces assigned for pickup is also really convenient."}
{"text":"First time. Service was great very personal. All the toppings looked fresh and pizza was cooked beautifully. Definitely a do over."}
{"text":"So nasty. Blaze, Mod, Piology, etc they are all the same but better than Fired Pie! Slow service and underwhelming pizza. Wait forever to get ranch. You'd be better off walking over to Whole Foods and getting pizza."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a couple of days ago and I'm already craving going again.  I ordered the 11\" create your own pizza.  I planned to eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner.  It was so good I ate it all in one sitting.  All aspects (food, customer service, and access) were great!"}
{"text":"I'm not particularly keen on personal pizzas usually but I was blown away by the combination of taste, variety of toppings, and price. I ordered the chicken pesto and pepperoni and mushroom pizzas and both were exceptional. The sauces are magnificent, the crust is cooked to perfection, and the toppings are superbly fresh and flavorful. Certainly a solid choice for pizza."}
{"text":"My brother took me here when I was visiting him.  The first thing I thought was that it was just like the Pionic at home but then I realized that I wish this place was near my house because it was so much better!  Heres why: The choices for the pizza's are awesome!  I loved that they had pretty much anything you can think of. The crust is crunchy and soft all at the same time. The people were super friendly (even though I see others have had different experiences, that was not mine).   I do think that because of the location be prepared for long waits."}
{"text":"Love a place where they actually smother Jalapeños over the Entire PIE upon request!! A+++ Just for that fact."}
{"text":"I enjoy these build-your-own pizza places, but this one I wasn't too excited about.  The taste of the pizza is weak, the ingredients are tasteless.   I had to ask for extra sauce as they barely spread any out.   The lemonade was weak and watery.  Even after they brought out a new batch on my refill, I was still turned off. The staff is polite and courteous, which made the rest of the experience nice.  However, I'll probably stick with Mod Pizza (who has multiple size pizza options and better flavor).  Blaze pizza is also just as good!"}
{"text":"Even though it was crazy busy and we almost left the line to try something else, it was worth the wait. It was lunch time so of course it was nuts and it was also our first time so I wasn't sure what to expect. The line moved quick, the employees were nice and efficient (a little light on the toppings, but they seem hard to spread out evenly), and they communicated with each other pretty well. Definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a pizza in 4 MINUTES!  This place is a great fresh new take on pizza and you can customize with as many ingredients as you want without the price.  Outstanding, I hope it continues to be this good.  Ask for your pizza well done if you like it crisp."}
{"text":"Ok, so this was random but I'm so glad I came across this place!  So they offer personal size wood fired pizza with as many ingredients as you want all for 1 low price. It's awesome. Protein up, veggie up, cheese it up..and it's at your table on the ready in like 7 min! Unreal!   So I know what you're thinking...Well hell, I can do that at home! Yeah, well you can also cook burgers at home yet McDonald's makes billions...so it's not the same.    Did I mention they sell booze? Beer and wine to be exact, so enjoy some vino and suds with your pie!  Oh, did I mention the fire cooked cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that melts like a virgin in Leo Dicaprio's arms? Yes, it's that amazing.   Lastly, they must be doing something right because the Manager/Owner said they are opening locations left in right all over metro Phoenix! So keep an eye out for one opening near your hood and check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The salads and balsamic dressing is amazing. Today I tried the herb flavored gluten-free crust and did it with no dairy....and even so, it was still yummy. Withh all the delicious toppings they offer I didn't even miss the cheese.  It's nice to have options make some healthy choices.  Tanya is great too, we love her!"}
{"text":"Good fast cas pizza. Crust was perfect wood fired. Topics are good. Grilled onions ... Yum."}
{"text":"Came here twice in one week! These are thin crust pizzas made to your liking. You can also choose one of their creations. I chose a combo of their creations with my own twist. Start with the garlic butter and then he Pesto chicken creation with onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, olives, artichoke hearts, peppers and viola! Tastes so delicious! You can also pair it with a salad too!  Lunch time gets packed. Dinner time varies. Could have been more efficient in their assigning of workers so the wait time for pizza assembly could have been reduced."}
{"text":"It was late and better than typical chain pizza. Wish I had more time, no humidity in the desert means very good pizza if you can find a wood fire oven."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. Pretty cool setup love the create your own setup. Being from Chicago I am pretty critical of pizza. My one knock is that I wish they had green and red bell peppers. They do have roasted peppers just not the same to a Chicago guy.   Definitely worth going. Quick service and delicious pie."}
{"text":"I am a very frequent customer and I wanted to say I always get the best service and everyone treats us so great all the employees are happy and smiley and put customer first and also fired pie is my absolute favorite pizza place by far Great pizza !!Great service!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Very good quality for a mall food court. Lots of good toppings including spicy sausage, roasted spinach, and pepperoni. I might pass on the bacon next time though, there were large chunks of inedible fat. I would go back every time I go shopping."}
{"text":"Generally, I'm not a pizza person. Went here for our standard hour lunch from work with a coworker who recommended the place. She'll eat anything though. :-)  Thin crust pizza and kinda reminds me of a Subway or Chipotle where you customize your own ingredients. I was surprised to find a couple of cheese selections to be fontina and feta. Not your normal selections, but I loved it. Some of the produce looked questionable, but not horrible. I think the warmth of the place makes the top layer wilt a little faster.  I was a little put off that the guy who was handling the meats and veggies didn't change his gloves. He handled at least 5 other customers before getting to mine and I had to ask him to change gloves. I'm allergic to beef and pork, so handling all those ingredients and then handling veggies was a huge no-no for me.  They do have a nice selection of toppings to choose from. Their crust isn't amazing, but for a quick stop, it is fine. I like their selection of iced teas to choose from.   I'll give them another try. They are friendly and it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"Heathy \"fast\" food. I had the fired Italian salad. It was delicious. The pizza others were eating looked great also, it was a perfect portion for one with a thin crust. This place is located downtown near the courts and ASU downtown campus and is convenient for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My trainer of all people told me to try this place. I'm sure he was hoping to steer me towards the salads, but I can't resist a good pizza covered in my favorite veggies. It's also close to my work making it a top choice for lunch breaks.  The ordering process is pretty easy although some members of the general public are a little too slow and indecisive to handle so many options. I love that they have fresh mozzarella in addition to the shredded stuff. I don't need a ton of cheese because my pie already has a ton of flavor from the artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, kalmata olives and garlic on it. The marinara is a tad on the sweet side for my taste, but it's still great overall.  I have even tried their pookie (an individual size pizza cookie) as part of an email list promotion. It held up well in the to-go packing. The cookie stayed warm and soft, and the ice cream remained unmelted. However, the cookie dough was diabeetus-inducing sweet. I'll stick with just the pizza in the future."}
{"text":"The food was good. The bad was the owner turned off the AC so it was ridiculously hot in there. The owner said the AC will break off he turns it on.  Will not go back. The pizza was good though. We got the pesto pizza which was tasty."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time last night.  It was awesome!  Love the patio next to the water- will definitely be out there when the weather cools down!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy to order. Serves alcohol. Very good lemonade. We ordered a tomato basil with chicken pizza. Very good fresh pizza. Ambient music kind of sucks. Fresh salad if that's why you came to a pizza shop. Excellent variety of pizza toppings. Dine in or to go."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salad.  Great service, fast and delicious!!! First time coming and won't be the last.   We customized all 3 pizzas.   Great flavor, crust was done just right and crispy.  A new family fav!"}
{"text":"Fulfilled our pizza cravings! For around $8 you can make a custom pizza with all the toppings you want! Nice thin crust pizza that is custom made and the best part is that you can customize your salad too! If you want not fuss just choose one of their pre-made pizzas.   I went with my own veggie pizza since I wasn't sold on their pre made one. I chose to use Alfredo sauce, but you have the options of tomato, pesto, and oil garlic too. They top it with basil at the end if you ask for it. They call out your name once the pizza is ready for pick up at the window. The pizza was perfect it wasn't burnt at all. We really enjoyed ourselves here and the best part was building our own pizza flavors to fit our personal tastes. I wouldn't mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience. All the employees seem HAPPY to work here. Everyone is friendly and the food...Pizza perfection!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. But the several times I've gone here I leave upset. The people who work there are rude. Every single time I've gone they're rude. It's like I'm an inconvenience to the people working there that I'm paying them for food. To me it's not just about the food it's about the customer service. And when I receive poor service more than 3 times in one place I'm done"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Fired Pie is AMAZING, and Krishonn's pizza she made for me was L I T E R A L L Y  the best pizza I've ever had. I'm from Chicago. I know pizza.   For months,  my friends have been talking about Fired Pie, and today I decided to see what all the buzz was about. I didn't expect much, to be honest. I'm from Chicago, and for years,  I've considered it the epicenter of pizza. The Mecca of Pizza, if you will.   Anyways, upon arrival, I quickly understood the the concept: Fast, made-to-order individual-sized pizzas, with a huge number of sauce, veggie, cheese & meat toppings to choose from. The employee who took my order was Krishonn. She was friendly and offered some good ideas for what to try. For a change of pace, I asked her to make me HER favorite pizza. A few minutes later, it arrived, and let me tell you... IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING PIZZA I've ever had to date. I uploaded pics and list of the ingredients. It was the perfect balance of savory & sweet.   Anyways, I'm a patron for LIFE now.   Ingredients:  The Krishonn Special:  Shredded mozzarella  Fontina Oil & Garlic Tomato sauce  BBQ sauce  Chicken Bacon Pepperoni  Sun dried tomatoes  Pine White onions."}
{"text":"I believe yesterday was their grand opening and what better way to open then by hosting a fundraiser. I heard about the fundraiser they were going to be hosting for the Phoenix Children's hospital, so we decided to stop by.  You had a choice between picking a pizza or a salad and the donations given were up to you. The line wasn't too long when we arrived, so we made it inside after 45min.   The inside is really nice and the all the little details make it really cool. They have several booths and tables and they also have tables outside in their patio.   The concept is easy. You go down the line customizing your pizza or you can pick the different ones they have already customized for you. The brick oven is right there in front of you and you see it all go down. Pizzas run for about $8.90 each. The price is good for a pretty good sized pizza.   The pizza was delicious! The employees were friendly even though they were slammed with the rush of people. We will definitely be back soon as we both enjoyed our pizza!!!! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Fired Pie locations around the valley and this is one of my favorites!   I love the gluten free crust and the fact that the majority of the sauces are gluten free (there is one that isn't but I can't remember which one off the top of my head because I haven't asked in a while). You can't beat their prices -- an 11\" pizza with unlimited toppings for $10 (including the extra $2 for the GF crust) and let me just say you won't be disappointed with the GF crust... It is crispy like a real crust, not soggy... Just great. I feel like for me they don't use enough sauce so I get a little extra but they definitely don't skimp on toppings.   Service is always excellent and quick. If you're ordering gluten free, they ask if you want them to switch gloves to prepare the pizza and also switch the pan it's cooked on, which are always appreciated."}
{"text":"Love this place! Salads and pizza what can be better! Lines super long but they get you through so fast! Don't let the line scare you away! The prices are so great! I love to get a small salad and share a pizza with my co-worker. Plenty of food for the both of us!"}
{"text":"What's wrong with a pizza version of subway? Making up a pizza how you want it, no limit? Absolutely nothing! It's freaking genius and it's delicious! All for $7.95? YES, PLEASE! You get your choice of sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies. And there are toppings galore! Best place to come make your own pizza and have someone else clean up the mess! To top it all off, the staff is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This was quite an experience. It's sort of like a Subway - but with pizza. Really, really GOOD pizza!!  Since this was my first visit, I was a little overwhelmed by the selection of ingredients and all the possible combinations so I ordered one of their suggested pies (the Fiesta) and it was delicious.  The thin crust had just the right proportion of crispy/chewy. I went in thinking that an 11\" pizza wasn't going to satisfy me, but I wound up taking two pieces home in one of the convenient boxes they have for leftovers. We got there a little after 7 pm on a Friday so it was a bit loud and fast-paced. If you're looking for quiet and romantic, this isn't your place. But I could see it as a perfect stop on your way to the movies, bowling, etc.  MY TIP: Since the line and ordering moves quickly, look at the menu and have a good idea of what you want BEFORE you get there."}
{"text":"Very good pizza in very little time! This is a pretty simple place. Not too much to say about it other than it was really good and flavorful... as were the leftovers :)"}
{"text":"You are my comfort food, you never fail to make me feel better once I sink my teeth into your cheesy goodness"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find out there was one close to me.   This was my first time at this location and I must say  it was a great experience.   Employees were super friendly. Ambiance was great. My favorite layout yet. Food is as good as you build it )  I will for sure go back to this Fired Pie."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never been to a pizza restaurant like this. Every time we go everyone is super nice and the pizza only takes like 5 min or less to cook! Also, the lemonade rocks! :-)"}
{"text":"Quality is starting to slide due to cleanliness issues with the oven. Getting charred bits of something on the crust now."}
{"text":"So good! I like that I get to choose what I want on my pizza and how much or how little. I love extra sauce and this place doesn't disappoint! I also love the sausage and the many topping choices. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"6 stars!  Whats not to love about making your own, completely customizable pizza with unlimited toppings for 10 bucks with a drink???  My personal fave is a mix of bbq and buffalo sauce as the base with mozzarella, bacon, ham, chicken, and pineapple. Its bomb.   And props to the owner. I spent some time talking to him one evening when i ran into him at this location. He and his partner have a great pizza business backround, and it shows.  Theyve been super successful opening close to 20 locations in just a couple years.   How someone could not like this place is beyond me. If you dont like fired pie, then you must not like pizza--in which case... why did you even come here?  Oh, and they have salads. And theyre good too if youre into that thing. I mean, i ate one, and thats sayin somethin considering the only other salad i'll eat is olive gardens. (Is lettuce with pep, bacon, salami, croutons, and italian dressing a salad or green pizza?)  The only down side to fired pie is that youve got to eat it while its hot. Since the dough is thin, it doesnt retain much heat."}
{"text":"Maybe because it was the end of the day, but literally my friend and I got the food we were eating swept out from underneath us. The waitress asked if we wanted a box and we both said yes, she came back and just took both our pizzas without asking if we were finished and packed it. Next cue was all the stools being banging against each other as she started stacking them. Really? You could have just told us that you were closing and not caused a scene.  I was waiting for the broom to come out. Funny thing is, is that there were other people in there as well. What about the food you ask?? The pizza was good.  Wood fired with a thin crust. I got the Italian near special and it really was delish."}
{"text":"Super fast very thin crust pizza as you like it for $8.99 or less and BOGO on special occasions. very tasty and filling with the freshest ingredients made in front of you."}
{"text":"Awesome dairy free pizza, made for you as you watch them make it and came out hot and ready in 10 mins or less. I had the veggie pizza on house dough with buffalo chicken and it was delicious. My only complaint was the vegan cheese was a little overwhelming so maybe order light cheese. No real complaints just a personal preference. I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Really great concept... It's the Subway of build-it-yourself pizza. Without being Subway! It's relatively inexpensive, side salads are around 3 bucks. The pizze dough itself is more like a crunchy flatbread, so it's not as high-calorie as regular pizza either. Been here a few times now, and it's also very fast at lunch, if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza ingredients, fast, and great value. Perfect place to go when your family/friends want pizza but everyone wants different toppings -no more pizza compromises!"}
{"text":"Even though the food is great I have to give it a 2 stars because I ordered online and for pick up at 12:05pm got here at 12:15pm and they were barely making my pizza. Made me late to work. The place was not busy, I was disappointed ."}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza!  We had five of us and everyone absolutely loved their pizza.  The price was fabulous less than eight bucks for anything you want on your pizza really good deal!"}
{"text":"Clean environment, friendly atmosphere, nice staff, good food, alcohol. I mean... Does it get any better than that?   The ingredients are fresh, there is a menu of pizzas and salads you can choose from or you can create your own happiness. My personal fav is the tomato basil with garlic oil and marinara, then some extra garlic, mushrooms, and spinach. Now that right there is some mighty fine eating!  The flavor is amazing and the wait is never long. I don't see myself not going here anytime soon. They are my new pizza addiction,  and I am not ashamed to admit it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place! Every table was filthy. When asked to clean a table , there was no action until a young puta decided to take the table we were waiting for. Then someone decided to help her because she was wearing a low cut shirt showing cleavage. The floor was filthy, too! Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the food much after all this."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good and the price is very reasonable. It's sure to please those who like their own kind of pizza. The price can't be beat and everyone can get what they want. I do wish they used better quality pepperoni. The ones they use are reminiscent of the mini pepperoni you can find in the grocery store. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"First time trying Fired Pie.  I got the steak and blue with added kalamata olives and fresh basil.  The pie was baked to perfection, the ingredients were delicious and extremely fresh!  My only negative was how slow it took to expedite my order once it was cooked.  There were quite a few employees on the assembly line, one cashier, one guy watching the oven and one expediter.  The baked pies started piling up and she couldn't keep up, she was taking the orders to the dining room looking for the customers, then would go back to get the next order.  There also was no system to which order was first, I watched my pizza sit on the counter while she had to read each paper to see which pizza went where and noticed people in line after me were getting their order first.  Frustrating, but I'm sure they're still working through the new phase, and I'll keep going back, just gotta plan for the extra time."}
{"text":"Anyone who remembers Elaine and the \"Big Salad\" episode on Seinfeld would appreciate the quality and SIZE of the salads here. Size matters!  If I'm spending $8-10 on a salad, I want more than a pitiful handful of \"fresh greens\" thrown in a skimpy bowl with a few accents.  I want an enormous salad, and that's exactly what I get every time at Fired Pie. When I decide to abandon the paleo diet and get a pizza, I'm never disappointed. I can throw caution to the wind and load up on as much cheese, meat, and extras as my gluttonous heart desires.  The workers are always generous, so if I say \"heavy on the pesto,\" they aren't chintzy.  The line can sometimes be long, so factor that in if you're going during lunch or dinner rush.  Just don't go next door to Paradise...their salads aren't as big."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. It is like chipotle for pizza. Fast, good, and you make the call. It is lacking completely in the environment just like chipotle. Take out is a good idea, but it works perfect for a lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"So I really enjoyed my visit/try of this establishment though slightly mixed review. The pizza was really good (especially for the price) and the overall atmosphere was nice with a friendly vibe. The staff that we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The lass who made and delivered our pizzas was great.  Now the negative, the restaurant was pretty empty while we were there yet most of the tables needed a wiping and the floor needed  a good sweep.   Would come again. Hopefully they can keep it tidier."}
{"text":"The ingredients are always fresh and the pizzas come out of the oven quickly. We love coming here! Tonight we had an exceptionally large group with some wild kids in the mix... they were so kind to us and didn't seem annoyed at all - I was shocked! I apologized for our rowdy group and they said, no worries, and thanked us for coming in. We will be back for sure- one of our favorites anyway - and hopefully the kids in our group will be better behaved next time :)."}
{"text":"Sooo good! The crust is super thin just how I like it. Great concept. So many options to choose for your pizza! I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"Yummo! We have been intending to come here for quite awhile and we chose the right time (1:30 on a Wednesday). No line and most of the tables open. We did get the last parking spot in the lot, however. My family of three ordered two build-your-own pizzas, which were freshly baked and brought to our table within 10 minutes. We hardly had enough time to gather drinks and silverware. No slowskies here!   The first pizza had tomato sauce, fresh moz, chicken, pepperoni, white onion, peppers, and spinach. The second had Alfredo, shredded moz, spicy sausage, meatball, spinach, pineapple and sundried tomatoes. The crust is very thin and crispy. Normally, I like thicker crust, but this one was tasty...not  a crispy saltine cracker like some thin crusts. Our toppings were fresh and delicious. The spicy sausage was super yummy and just a slight kick. They let you put multiple toppings on(including a variety of meats), all included in the $7.95 cost for an 11-inch pie. Awesome! We later got their dessert cookie for $3. You can get choco chip or white choco macadamia. Our choco chip cookie was baked in a mini pizza pan (probably the circumference of their medium cups) and topped with vanilla ice cream. It is very small but perfectly sized if you pigged out on pizza as we did. Oink! Oink!    We will try different combos next time like a BBQ chicken or Alfredo and pesto veggie pizza. If you aren't a creative genius, they have some pre-determined creations as well. We were slightly disappointed with the veggie options, as we would have loved zucchini and broccoli that they have at another local DIY pizza place.   We also wish that they had highchairs. There are only a few booster seats that do not even have straps, which is odd in a family neighborhood. The service was really good, with the small exception of them not giving us our drink cups. The presumed owner checked in on us and provided our cups though (thank you!). Love it when owners are involved. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza with nice zesty sauce (if you try the red) and good crust( on the thin side but nice chew). Fun made to order and get your pizza quick. Many types of cheeses sauces and toppings to choose from, better not to overload it as they all tend to blend together.  Salads are actually tasty as well, I tried the blue/steak. They also have a few alcohol options.  All in all  solid spot for around $10"}
{"text":"The salad I had was good and the pizza was ok fresh but the leftover wasn't good cold the next day.  For me if it isn't good cold I won't get it again."}
{"text":"Love this place they have all kinds of great toppings and the pizza is the same price no matter how many toppings you get $7.99. Everything here is amazing. They even have fresh baked chocolate chip cookies topped with ice cream for $3.00. They have great lemonade too. Staff is super friendly and food is made fast too."}
{"text":"First time in..  Love the idea of loading up a pie anyway I like it, with whatever toppings.  Helpers behind the counter were super friendly, and happy to do whatever with your pizza I wanted.  The wait was way too long for me at lunch but the end result was absolutely great.  (Could have been because it was lunch).  I questioned waiting, but glad I did  Great concept, so glad I went in...    Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I was pretty sure this was going to be like a glorified Peter Piper, and I am pleased to say I was wrong. Pretty much this place is a chipolte but with pizza. Pick your dough, sauce, and toppings and they cook it up right away.  The staff was super nice and friendly, and they work hard and fast. When I got there, the line was out the door, but they moved through it very quickly so don't get escared.  I recommend this spot if you are in the mood for some good, quick pie.  It's not expensive, and you get a good amount of food. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is awsome! Every time I come here I've personally haven't experienced bad customer service so far. Its clean, quick, employees are friendly, food taste amazing and the price is reasonable. I come here to enjoy freshly made pizza that doesn't come from my freezer or isn't already made-sitting in a warmer for hrs type of place. The cookies pizza with ice cream is a must to end your meal :-P"}
{"text":"great made to order pizza, it can take while if busy though, they really need to rethink the ordering system because as soon as a line forms it takes forever..Pizza taste great once you get it though"}
{"text":"Dude....what's not to like?? A personal 11 inch thin crust pizza for $8.45 with your choice of ANYTHING on it...,this place is awesome... Very good, fresh ingredients, quick service..,"}
{"text":"Excellent 11 inch pizzas w/ thin crust. Like a Subway you go through the line ordering what cheeses, meats, veggies u want. Then u pay & wait at a table for them to bring it.  Would give 5 stars if they had wifi."}
{"text":"June 3rd: this was my first time here. The ice machine was broken, my salad tasted like onions (despite the fact that I asked for none since I am allergic) and the restaurant was dirty. Staff seemed young and inexperienced with no one in charge. The pizza was delicious but next time I'll get it to go."}
{"text":"Very good service and great idea for pizza. I plan to revisit with friends and family often."}
{"text":"What a great find. Thin crust pizza cooked up fast and delicious. Build your own pizza or have them build one fresh for you. Either way, both are great choices and another visit is a must."}
{"text":"My girls and I go to Fired Pie at least once a week.  So yummy.  So affordable.  We can get 2 pizzas for less than what we pay for dinner at Panda (another one of our faves.)  I explain it to people that it's like Subway for pizza.  Pick your sauce, pick your cheese, pick your toppings.  5 minutes later you have deliciousness.  LOVE!"}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Pizza or salad! Love the beer and wine also great with a nice pizza. You have so many choices and they have choices for you. The staff is nice and talkative which I like a lot. Wish they put the menu in the front where the toppings are and not right when you enter. Because when you get to the front you already forgot what toppings. Also with the beer and wine they should have TVs would love enjoying a beer and watching some sports or news. Place is nice."}
{"text":"Love the concept and really surprised at the quality.  Crust was thin but good and held up to the extra cheese and five meat pizza I ordered.  Pizza was cheap (cost) fast and really good.  Winner winner pizza dinner."}
{"text":"We have something similar in my hometown of San Diego called Project Pie. Totally the same concept. Same delicious outcome. It's a build your own pizza place. Put whatever you want on it for one price. I've been to this location and the one in DT Phoenix and this one is MUCH better (food consistancy and quality wise as well as the staff is better at this location.) Fortunately, I work out in Deer Valley, so I'll gladly stick to coming to this one."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to get a hot, delicious pizza (customized I might say), in about 10-15 minutes, this is your place! The choices are endless, and the price is really good, it's about $9 for a pretty decent-sized thin crust with a bunch of toppings. The only thing I would get rid of here, is the extremely tall panes of glass I have to talk over to get my order through (I know, I'm short), but hey, maybe lower it down just a tad? So I don't have to repeat myself.. just don't wanna yell at the person making my food. : /"}
{"text":"Live across the street. Love the pizza and ability to customize. People were so nice. Meatball, pesto, tomato sauce, and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Eh, that is the best way to describe the food and service. Employees were goofing off and not paying attention.....hence the free beer that they didn't charge me for as well as the burnt pies the cook wasn't paying attention to.  Next girls night out, will definitely be steering clear of this mediocre option"}
{"text":"Perhaps my bar is high, since I'm used to NYC pizza. The sauce was bitter/tangy. I wish I could reverse time and undigest that meal. Hunger is stubborn. Go elsewhere...I have no suggestions though.... The pizza could be worse...but it could be SOOO much better.  The second star is for a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! My husband and I were walking around downtown Phoenix checking out how they're setting up for Super Bowl, and we decided to stop in at this place. It's kind of like Subway in that you walk up to a station and pick your pizza topics/sauces/cheese through a bane window.  I didn't have high hopes to be honest but the pizza was finished in about 3 minutes and it was the best pizza I've had in a long time. I polished the whole pie! You can't beat the prices either, $7.95 for an 11\" pie with whatever you want on it. We'll be returning for sure. two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very impressed! Great price for unlimited toppings. Thin crust, nice and crispy! $3 domestic bottles, we will definitely be back! Good quality, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Thin crust and delicious. Only drawback....if you show up around noon you'll be in a pretty good line. Must have been 20 people in front of us. Pies cook real fast...its the assembly line thats slow. With all those people you'd think they'd be pros by now, whipping toppings on the pie and moving along. Unfortunately the guy putting on pepperoni was super slow! One piece placed on at a time,, then he'd stop, talk to his line partner and go back and move the pepperoni around on the pizza. But its definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I like how they have the whole any topping you want thing going on for only $8 something. I do not like how they barely put any sauce and cheese on the pizza. What kind of pizza barely has sauce on it? I didn't ask for a margarita pizza. I thought this was create your own pizza, I guess not. They gave me a crappy excuse of how if they put too much sauce or cheese it messes up their oven. I didn't get too much of either, I definetely barely got any sauce cause you could still see the dough cleary with little spots of sauce here and there. I dont like how the paper they put the pizza on easily rips. I think I ate some by accident. I swear some of it melted under my slices and into them. Not good. The guy making my pizza kept touching the dough and some of my toppings with his belly and his dirty shirt as he was making the pizza. I could have had a good experience but I didn't. All I wanted was some sauce and cheese and for someone not to put their body on my food. I guess that's too much to ask for here. I'll stick to studio pizza. At least that place actually lets you make your pizza however you want and with unlimited toppings unlike this wannabe pizza spot. I was upset with my visit. The pizza did taste alright but I did feel like it needed more sauce, OF COURSE. I also thought a little more cheese was necessary. Good taste, horrible rules and sloppy service with no common sense or people skills. I had to basically beg for some sauce on the side so I could attempt to try and fix my pizza. The sauce was cold so it didn't really work out as I thought it would."}
{"text":"A co-worker told my wife about the new pizza place at Park Central and I knew we had to go.  We went in at 6 PM and were the only customers, although a few people trickled in after us. Park Central is vacant after 5PM, so that wasn't surprising. There was another Italian place here years ago, but I can't recall the name offhand.  The first thing that catches your eye is the pizza oven, with a raging fire inside. The pizza is about 12\" in diameter, just right for one hungry person. The ingredients are all in front of you, much like the counter at Subway, and they build your pizza as you watch (or salad, which my wife had). You can create your own pizza from a variety of sauces and cheeses, and an assortment of meats and veggies, or, order off their menu. I ordered off the menu and had the meaty Italian. Sauce, cheese, toppings, and a minute or two later it's in the oven. My wife ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad, but began customizing as it was assembled, \"no, leave off the onions and peppers. Can I have balsamic instead of the southwest dressing?\"  We sat down and they brought my pizza out a few minutes later. It was piping hot, with just the right amount of char on the bottom of the very thin crust. The sauce, cheese, and toppings were all great and worked well together. I finished it quickly! My wife enjoyed her salad, but wasn't very hungry after a big lunch, so she took most of it home and is going to have it for lunch today.  They are not yet serving beer and wine, which was the only disappointment on our visit, but they told us the City permits are taking longer than expected. I'll be back for vino.  Pino's on Thomas is within slingshot distance of Fired Pie. They've been serving great pizza for a long time, so it takes balls to open another pizza place this close to Pino's. They can definitely give Pino's a run for its money!  Salads and pizzas are both priced at $7.75."}
{"text":"Fired pie is a neat concept i like being able to pick muy crust and toppings the pizza is good and service is good and the place is clean except for those air ducts above you need a good cleaning I don't want that stuff dropping in my food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Short wait, delicious and light pizza. The staff was super courteous and helpful. It was clean and comfortable.  I'll definitely be hitting this place up again next time!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo. I ordered a salad from the pre-designed list and it was a total disappointment. I usually create my own, but the steak and blue featured what was called \"thinly sliced steak\" which I thought sounded really good. Jokes on me, it was roast beef - which I never ever eat. This lunch ended up being an entire waste of both time and money. I won't be making this mistake ever again."}
{"text":"I popped my Fired Pie cherry tonight and purchased two different pizzas. While out with the kids we couldn't decide on dinner and checked Yelp for locations close to us and high rated reviews. Fired Pie was the top of the list and I soon found out why.   The selection is great and the price is budget friendly. We decided to get one pizza for the kids (Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, bacon and black olives) and one for the wife and I (Alfredo sauce, feta cheese, sausage, and mushrooms). Both were very good!  Imagine a pizza place that prepares custom pizza just like Chipotle or Subway. It's pretty much the same concept and offers a lot of variety. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Favorite gluten-free pizza. Always fresh and tasty!Love creating my own pizza. Great atmosphere and staff. Eaten here multiple time and haven't been disappointed once."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick custom pizza!  Custom is the key word. You select regular or gluten free crust (unfortunately they only have one size, an 11 inch individual), then you get to pick the sauce (red, white, olive oil / garlic, etc).   The selection of toppings is very good (no anchovies, but honestly who orders anchovies on a pizza anyway?). They have the standard pepperoni, sausage, meatball and for the more adventurous salami,  capicola, bacon) and a garden of veggie toppings and cheese.  All this and a drink for about $10 and it's ready in less than 10 minutes.  Great place for a quick pie!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often (once every 2 weeks) and when I do, it's for a naked ceasar salad because its basic and nothing out of the ordinary. It runs a little under $7 typically. Today I decided I would just asked for a little bit of red onion on it. I was charged $9 because they considered that a custom salad. When it was brought up to her attention at the register, I was told that it's not their choice and that they had to charge me $2 extra for 7 slivers of red onion. She is lucky I didn't ask her to take it off truthfully. I don't see me going there anytime soon. I can get a small handful of red onions added onto a basic caesar salad elsewhere and not be charged $2 extra."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!  This pizZa is delicious if you like thin crust pizza!  You can customize it anyway you like!  Everyone was SO friendly.  Clearly we're not the only ones who love it... The place was packed on a Saturday night!  I only dinged one star because the Chardonnay was \"meh\".  Otherwise, we are fans and will def be back!!"}
{"text":"I'll never go to fired pie again. They do not offer an option for children. I will head to Peter Piper Pizza down the road which DOES offer a children's option."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Bait and switch? Got a flier from a representative from this place and they won't honor their advertisement. It's says that you get a custom pizza and salad made from scratch all at a respectful price of 7.75 I thought that was a great deal until I called and the guy who answered said it was either or not for both. Sucks because I heard that their pizza is not bad but I'm not going to spend my hard earned money at a place that won't honor their mistakes. Good luck Fired Pie."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this location. Both times, great food but both times I was the only person in there and there were 4 people behind the pizza line talking and on their phones, but when I tried to find a place to sit down a majority of the tables are dirty, and were never cleaned during my visit but the socializing continued."}
{"text":"I like this concept, like going to a Subway sandwich shop. They start with a 11\" crust, then you pick your sauce, cheese and toppings all for one price. They then put your pizza in the oven and about 5 minutes later you have your pizza. Just one thing I wish is that they had a choice in pizza crusts e.g. wheat crust or gluten free crust."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good! Been 2 times in the past 4 days. The Bellini is delicious as well. The only thing I will warn is the Cesar salad. The dressing is really good (as I am picky about my dressing) but the mix of greens they use was a little unpleasing for me. My partner liked it but I thought the basil (at least that is what we decided it was) was way too overpowering. That is honestly all I could taste. But let me tell you, it did not stop is for a second in deciding to come back!!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate to give this review but I feel as though people need to be informed. My husband and I ate here last night (4/21/17) and it was a busy time for them. Around 5:30 this morning my husband was experiencing what seemed to be food poisoning. Then around 10 this morning it started for me. I still have yet to be able to keep anything down and I only had a cheese pizza. Hubby is doing better though. I would just use extreme caution when eating here."}
{"text":"Nice place for salads.  I like how you can control the ingredients. Pizza is good.  I had it once where the crust got too dark, but it seems like an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Better ingredients. Better pizza. Not PJ's.  But seriously, for the price you can't go wrong. Under $10 gets you a personal pizza or a big salad with fresh ingredients from all across the pizza spectrum; NO additional cost! Great atmosphere and friendly service; a shiny new gem in Historic Park Central!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here before and would always go to the pizza creation and today I decided to try something different. The Buffalo Chicken Caesar Salad was my choice and I have to say that it was delicious. The only problem I had with my salad was that is wasn't enough, it was served in a bowl that I could have had more, if only refills were an option and it would be best. Overall it was great, if I am ever around the area I would definitely come back to get pizza next time."}
{"text":"Decent pizza place for the price. It's very fast-casual as in you get to customize your pie anyway you want to or you can choose from their own creations. They serve alcohol here as well if thats a deal breaker. Went with the  Hawaiian BBQ which came out nice and crispy. Good service, tasty pie and good prices. Just think pizza - Chipotle style and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch, you can get in and out within 30 minutes with a freshly cooked pizza.   Good selection of ingredients even a gluten free/ dairy & vegan free nut like myself can find a pizza combination that is very edible.    Disclaimer for allergy suffers is that the gluten/vegan items may come into contact with gluten or dairy products.  Which you do have to understand.   Overall pretty good.  They have a Pepsi 'freestyle' machine and even serve a few beers.  The sign over head reads \"locally operated\" which is exactly what you want really. I don't like my pizza to be made and cooked by call centers in India or South America so I'm glad the staff are local"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place!  To be brutally honest, I was expecting a mediocre pizza, produced with a very interesting business idea, being that I could build it myself. I couldn't have been more wrong.  The quality of everything they offered was top notch.  Furthermore, the staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will be going back ASAP."}
{"text":"Great lil pizza joint. We got 3 pizzas last night. Steak n Blue, Meaty Italian, and Chicken Pesto. I told them bout my allergies to the Blue cheeses (aka penicillin molds) and they were great about making mine seperate and cutting it seperate. Super fast service, great pizza, great customer service... we will be back."}
{"text":"If you like a cracker thin pizza, this place is for you!  Build your own pizza and salads. The pizza was good. Salads are hearty. Great for family's who have a range of pizza topping likes. Pretty quick too! My pizza was fired in about 5 min."}
{"text":"The pizza here is tasty and well priced - about $10.00 with a medium drink. The dining area is funky, fresh and fun. The staff was friendly and efficient. Everything was clean and bright. Perfect for group lunches!  The restaurant is sort of hard to find - it's located near the Good Egg/Jimmy Johns. It's not easily seen from the parking lot. Just aim for Jimmy Johns and it's next door.They do have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The idea of personal pizzas is great! You can choose all of your ingredients, which sauce, which cheeses, which meats, and which veggies. But $9 seems a bit high for a mini pizza, or maybe it's just me. It was delicious, granted I could choose every aspect of my pizza. :) Excellent if you're in a rush and need to pick up a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Excited to have this place close by. This is a quick option for lunch or dinner. Easy and relatively inexpensive. Do not have to pay extra for toppings which is nice. *Note that they do not except above Yelp 20% check in."}
{"text":"I come to Fired Pie quite often because I don't care for a lot of carbs and they typically put plenty of cheese and meat on a pizza. But this time I get my pizza made by a woman wearing a collared shirt and she was the most stingy ever with ingredients. I guess when the managers work you just don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Love making my own pizza here. I always make sure I eat here everytime I shop in Tanger outlet."}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are awesome so are the prices!  Their salads are huge and their pizza is amazing. .I love the tomato basil."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Why didn't I think if this concept!!!! It's like a subway or chipotle line for pizzas. This thin crust cooks in minutes. Tasted great. No limit on toppings. Only complaint was a pizza and drink (probably a common order) came to $10.01. I realize local taxes come into play but I'm a guy and hate carrying change around plus I don't like leaving change in the tip jar. Come hungry and bring a penny."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is amazing. If Yelp let me write just that, I would because nothing else need be said. It's Chipotle for pizza and the mere fact that it's pizza over Mexican food is fantastic in and of itself. But it's also high quality, fast, and fully customizable.   So, this review is for Yelp. If I put 5 stars - let that speak for itself and let Fired Pie reign supreme."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop by for a salad. You can custom make it or order off the menu and there's so many fresh items to choose from! The staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Delivers exactly what it advertises: quick, cheap, quality pizza with a Chipotle-style assembly. With so many other decent pizza options in the Downtown area, Fired Pie surprisingly holds its own."}
{"text":"First time ever at Fired Pie and it was excellent. The staff was friendly, engaging, and helpful. The pizza was delicious and they had a decent selection of beer available. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"The food couldn't have had less flavor. Had a pesto chicken pizza and the pesto sauce was beyond bland and the chicken was devoid of seasoning.  On the positive side, the food was delivered quickly so we had no issue getting to movie on time."}
{"text":"I found out about this place on Yelp actually and decided to give it a try. Glad I did because the pizzas taste very good and the pricing is awesome. Just $8 and can put whatever topping on your pizza that you'd like.  The only thing I would say is that it was just a bit too cold in the restaurant in my opinion; the pizza got cold kinda fast. However; that didn't stop me from going back a second time. Ill be back again soon with my boyfriend because our son loves the pizzas here!"}
{"text":"We've been to a Fired before this location,  and been to Mod Pizza....  But based on today's visit,  the attitude from most of the staff (except the one doing meats) was really disappointing.   Mod's pizza is better and really is who we'll go back to.   Fired does have fresh mozzarella that Mod doesn't and the side salad is better here.   Sorry Fired...  We came,  we tried and we're going to Mod Pizza next time."}
{"text":"So the only reason I am updating my review is strictly for the disappointing service the last few times we have gone.  I love the pizza, but like a few other recent reviews,  the lack of service is frustrating. Tonight for example there were a handful of workers but only 1 guy making pizza for the people in front of us and finally after a line stays forming one of the gals very slowly put on gloves while chatting with another gal working,  she slowly presses the dough, slowly puts it on a board and eventually addresses us like we were a bother. I get my pizza made and she puts it off to the side and assumed my mom wants a pizza and asks what kind of sauce and cheese? My mom wanted a salad, so she makes the salad and we ask for tomatoes on the Ceasar salad and says that will cost extra... $1.50-$2.00... for tomatoes, really??! I am normally not the type to complain, but come on!  Most of the guys were super nice and friendly, but I can't say the same for the girls except the nice gal with the braces,  she was sweet.  Again, I do love the pizza, but when the service starts going down hill,  makes me want to avoid it to save myself the frustration."}
{"text":"I will tell you that I loved the pizza and salad here. I wish I would have taken pictures, but my husband and I were so hungry we gobbled up the food before we could.   The people who work here are fun and energetic and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service at a great price. My kids ask to come to fires pie about once a month and it's just as good every time"}
{"text":"This place is SO good!   I'm from Jersey, and I love a good east coast pie. This isn't typical east coast pizza but it is delicious.   We got a plain cheese pizza for the kids and they liked it. We also got the tomato basil pie which was great. But the best one we got was fresh mozzarella with bacon and bell peppers and white onion (custom). It was outstanding!! Best tasting pie to date.  I forgot to add, on the bacon pie/fresh mozzarella pie, the gracious person who answered the phone advised me to get mozzarella with the fresh mozzarella as it does not cover the entire pie. Great advice! I appreciated that.   Also, I read a review that said the person's pie was underdone. I asked for my pies crispy but not burned, and they were PERFECT!"}
{"text":"I've been to the chandler location several times and was never disappointed. We've only been here once. The pizza was good. But- we ordered the tomato basil pie, which is supposed to come with fresh mozzarella...and didn't. Minus one star.  We also ordered a salad. It was so salty we couldn't eat it. Not sure if it was the actual salad or dressing but it tasted like half a salt shaker spilled on it. And I like salt. Minus one more star... But all in all, the pizzas tasted really good."}
{"text":"1 star because the pizza is good , what kills this compared to the growing competition in this area is the service , they are well staffed but for some reason orders are not put in a timely manner( and there were no customers at the moment !)  , they ignore the phone calls so forget having a to go order here , I waited for 30 minutes for a pizza cookie , because they just forgot ..... and did not apologize for it whatsoever ,if you're in for crappy  service then this is your place , this close to my home but I'm willing drive the extra 5 minutes somewhere else"}
{"text":"Holy moly ! It's 110 outside , almost 50% humidity and we walked in the AC was BROKEN!!! took a chance and ordered , come to pay , the credit card machine was down !!!!!!!!  Employees were sweating it was sad , they said they've made attempts to contact the manager /owner , the least they could have done was purchase a few fans at Costco or maybe target next door , it was unbearable and unreal that customers and employees were made to eat and work in those conditions ! This was going on for 2 hours and no progress at all!"}
{"text":"Super yummy! The crust is thin enough to not make you feel like you ate too much. Everything looks fresh, and of quality. & it's very inexpensive. Definitely found our new pizza spot!!! Yay!"}
{"text":"I literally JUST finished eating my food... and I felt compelled to write my review immediately.  Tonight I was very unsure as to what I wanted.  Coming from Las Vegas, and not knowing the area well, I drove to a nearby center and looked at my options.  I needed fast, fresh, and delicious!  I picked Fired Pie!  The menu was posted on the window and the doors were open and inviting.  The staff looked friendly from the doorway, as I plunged down the walkway to the counter.  Now... this is like Subway, but is SO SO SO much better.  And of course, its pizza and salads (not subs).  But the idea is great!  It is an \"invent your own\" or a \"choose one of ours\" style place - where the options and combos are endless for your pizza or salad choice.  I chose to create my own pizza.  11 inches of flat crust, regular pizza sauce, and meat meat meat.  Cuz really.. who doesn't love meat?  I had sausage, bacon, pepperoni... and Canadian bacon (since I AM CANADIAN), which really is \"ham\" to all you American folk!  Either way, this piled high atop my mozza and parm cheeses.  I then added fresh tomato slices, spinach, mushrooms, red onion... and called it quits at that.  It was placed for a few minutes in the big brick oven flaming in front of me, and cooked to absolute perfection!  My mouth is craving another piece just writing this...  I also got a southwest salad - which is lettuce, peppers, olives, jalapenos, tortilla chips, and more - plus I added fresh tomatoes, onion, and got the dressing on the side.  It has a chipotle ranch dressing - and OH MY WORD it is delicious.    All in all, I was not disappointed leaving there for under 20 bucks for two large meals, AND I have some to spare... for both of us to eat another time.  For $7.75 each - this felt like an absolute bargain.   The staff was friendly, there was tonnes of indoor and outdoor seating, and it was clean!  In addition, when the food was done, I was asked if it was as I wanted it.    My ONLY gripe is WHY THE HELL IS THIS NOT IN VEGAS?  My God... I would definitely be fatter if that was the case...  I WILL go back next time I am in town... hopefully soon!!  Or... someone can get smart and try their luck in Sin-City :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza,  fast,  and priced right!   I ordered their veggie pizza and I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was thin, crispy, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place overall.  It's hard to go to a pizza shop when I'm eating alone (usually $20, 3000+ calories), but they have a good system in place.  Tons of space inside.  Very easy parking.  It's in the center where you'll find Starbucks, The Good Egg, etc.  To be honest I was going to the Good Egg and saw your sign and realized you were one of my bookmarks.  The restaurant can't be seen from the street or even the parking lot.  I'm glad I changed my mind and went here.  The service was very friendly from all of the staff.  The pizza was $7.95 and it's more than enough for one person.  It could feed two and it's a great price if you choose that route.  I'll take my nieces here and have them split one and feed 2 hungry kids for $4 each plus drinks.  I ordered the Meaty Italian (pic enclosed).  I ordered, got my drink, went to the little island to grab some parm and peppers, say down, took out my tablet, and by then the pizza was ready.  Probably under 5 minutes.  Very fresh and hard to believe it was that fast.  Despite the low price they offered to put anything else on it that I wanted so I chose the sweet peppers.  Same price, which is nice because I hate it when you order a pizza and the toppings double the price.  The place was clean, they serve fountain drinks so you can refill, and the decor was modern.  If you want to grab a pizza and not break the bank and maybe get 2 meals out of it, check out this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot by work.  You can load up your salad or pizza with every single topping, and no one bats an eyes. They offer \"pre selection\" menu options, or you can customize. They also have limited bottled beer, and Bellinis.   They keep the ovens at near 500 degrees, so your food cooks VERY fast. I've yet to have a pizza undercooked, or burnt. They have it down to a science.   The staff is friendly, and remembers me, and makes recommendations to \"spice up\" my usual, and they are always right.   They are VERY busy during the lunch time, which is great for them, but apparently I've told too many people about my secret lunch spot.   The ONLY downside, is any way you slice it - it's fast food pizza. It's never going to compare with New York pie.   I will certainly be back :)"}
{"text":"This reminded me of a restaurant I went to in San Diego called Project Pie. Which was awesome!  The food was fulfilling and tasty! The staff was friendly and professional.  Overall the look of the place was okay, the walls were bare and could use more decorations. It was difficult finding a clean table so maybe work on clearing tables as soon as possible. But that was the only thing that was \"iffy\" on the place.  I wish they served wings!"}
{"text":"Ok folks, if you are looking for a gluten free pizza, then this is IT! I have searched the world over and this one is delicious!!! Nice texture and you barely know it is gluten free. Mine had chunky tomato, fontina, Coppola, artichokes, mushrooms and basil. The bomb"}
{"text":"Wanted something quick and this place had good reviews.  The Pizza amazing and the naked Cesar Salad was great also. So reasonable for two people."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly better than I thought. Another place my husband dragged me to. Personal pan pizza made to order. I thought it would be kinda fast food like. Turns out it's actually really good pizza and pretty inexpensive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times since they opened. We love it. I compare it to Chipotle but instead u design a pizza or a salad. So many ingredients! We have always had the nicest people working behind the counter. They communicate w you the entire way to make sure your order is perfect. They have little chocolate chip cookies that come right out of the oven w ice cream too. Yum."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love that I can build my own pizza. I love to do half Buffalo sauce and half bbq sauce. I like to top it with chicken, pineapple, spinach, tomatoes, and olives. The pizza is fresh because they make it in front you and it's crispy and hot when they bring it to you. How could you not love this place? I am a regular!"}
{"text":"I love Fired Pie. My daughter and I came here for some lunch. We shared a pizza. She got sauce and cheese on her side and I got bbq chicken on my side. I love that we were able to do split pizzas so that we both can get what we wanted. I love that there's no extra charge for toppings. It's awesome.   While my daughter and I were eating our pizza, a woman and I believe her son come in and they had some concerns based on her son's diet restrictions. There were two employees there and they were helpful. She'd ask about the ingredients and they'd go get it for her. They didn't have a poor attitude about it all, they were willing to do whatever they needed to answer the woman's questions. As a customer it was nice to see how they were going above and beyond. You don't see a lot of people doing that. It was great to witness it."}
{"text":"I have been a regular to fired pie for at least a year now, but at other locations. I have gone to this location a couple times now and they have been the friendliest/most helpful staff that I've had an experience with. They make a great pizza taste even better by putting a little \"fun\" into it :) The customizations are always everything you'd want and more for gluten free AND vegan options"}
{"text":"Pizza is always good, but the service at this specific location is terrible. The young girl making the pizzas spent more time on her eyes lashes and makeup than she does taking care of customers. There were easily 6 employees all standing around and only her making a pizza and no one hopped in to help me standing in line waiting for more than 5 minutes. They were all talking amongst each other and making jokes and she would even turn around FROM THE PIZZA SHES MAKING to contribute to conversation with them. Like girl, really? I understand this was probably most of their first jobs as they didn't really look like they've ever worked a day in their life, but it's REALLY not hard to provide even a little customer service...I don't care how long of a day you've had. That's your job, you signed up for it, you're getting paid to do it. She half assed my pizza as well and when one of the guys brought it over to me when it was done, he just tossed it onto my table and said here you go and walked away.... wow. Yeah I eat here way too frequently than I'd like to admit but clearly not coming to this location again if it's always like this."}
{"text":"First, let me lay a little bit of foundation for this review... I am a self-proclaimed pizza expert that has had pizza in 5 continents, numerous countries, many US states, and all throughout the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Specifically, I have tried virtually every new-age, custom pizza parlour to grace nearly every corner of Scottsdale and northeast Phoenix in the last few years. And so it is with proper perspective when I say that Fired Pie is the one such pizza place that simply gets it right. Fresh ingredients, perfect crust, perfect cooking time, good service... all that stuff. The only down-sides are that the dining area isn't all that comfortable (so it's more of an in and out operation, which is probably the intent), the plates are not readily available like the utensils (so one has to ask) and not all of the kids behind the counter always have their \"head in the game\" (so one has to be prepared to provide varying levels of hand-holding during the order). However, the end product and the overall experience are well-worth it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place so we had to try it. Very glad we did! Loved the options available to chose from.  Pizza cooked quickly and wasn't greasy."}
{"text":"Well, it's just a review of this location, because we have eaten at a few locations previously. I hate when something is supposed to be \"unlimited\" and they tell you you can't have any more! I love cheese and I want a lot!! After one cup I said that I am going to need a lot more and then I was told they can only do a little bit more...wtf!  Then the other toppings were scarce as well...\"more please\"...ugh  Now, since the weather is getting nicer we decided to eat outside, well, apparently people don't do that here because it's gross with bird dookie and dirt all over everything. A hose down would go a long way!  Moving from Gilbert is going to be a very rude awakening"}
{"text":"5 Stars every visit I've had here! I have never liked thin crust, until my first visit to Pizza Me! There pizza's are the best, every variety I've ever tried is super delicious!   The staff is super friendly and this is one of Scottsdale's best new restaurants this year, for sure!  Almost everything you can custom make to your perfection, even the drink because they have those cool coca cola machines!  They have a dog friendly patio too, just make sure to be a good parent and bring your leash :)   They have \"family happy hour\" which is great on Thursday and Friday.  Yum! I want to go there now while I write this review!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why I'm giving 3 stars...   Let's talk food first. The pizza are pretty good. Custom your pizza are always the best..   But the customer service sucks so bad. Everyone here like hates their job or something. They talk like they hate everyone... No please or thank you... Very rude and straight forward."}
{"text":"love love love fired pie... great food, great staff!!  I'm always impressed with how fast they get us through the line and how delicious everything is... perfect every time."}
{"text":"The food is good, great Menu....but, WOW!! SLOWWWWwwww.....the employee taking orders, creating the Pizza was Extremely Slow, like he didn't care at all..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening and there was only 2 other people in line.  We've never been to one of these but figured it was like a chipotle pretty quickly.  The girl helping us tried to explain the concept but it was hard to hear her because the music was loud and the glass was pretty high.   Anyway, we got the gist of it and went to town!  Made our own pizza and salad and got out of there for less than $17 for the hubs, myself and our 3 year old.    The pizza was thin crust and was really good.  The salad was huge and delicious!    I got turned off a little when the girl that rang me up bickered with a slight attitude at the girl that made my salad and told her my salad was too big and heavy.  She should've waited to tell her when there wasn't anyone standing right there paying for their meal."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Do I need to say more. Absolutely still my favorite fast food, thin crust pizza! Pesto, chicken, spinach, feta, mozzarella, bacon, garlic and sauté onions! Baked to perfection."}
{"text":"Love this chain. Pesto pizza with feta cheese, meatball and chicken! Enough said! Thin crust yum! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Tonight my wife Nisma and I wanted to take a night off from cooking food at home so we figured we would try something NEW. We had received a mailer coupon for Fired Pie. We liked the name and we were going to get a free desert so we figured \"What the hey\".   The establishment is EXTREMELY clean and well kept. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The place reminds me of a Mongolian BBQ. You can stack as many extras on  your pizza as you want and then they cook it.  Now lets get down to the food and value.  You just have to be mindful that it you put a lot of toppings on your pizza that will cook down and leave juices, it will effect the bottom of your crust, not allowing it to support the contents of the slice once you fold it in half. Make the wrong choices on toppings and you will have a sloppy mess when you lift it up to your mouth and will have to \"Knife and Fork it\". If you use the proper ingredients you will be rewarded with a nice crunchy bottom on your slice that will support its own weight. Ingredients are GREAT! The mozzarella is low moisture and you have your choice of grated or whole chunks and they have a host of other cheeses. Options for topping are unlimited, 3 sauce choices and 3 crust choices. One is gluten free for an extra 2 bucks. Lots of veggies and choices for you vegans out there.  We had a regular crust, tomato sauce with grated and whole mozzarella, candied walnuts, olives, heavy on the mushrooms, roasted chicken and sun dried tomatoes. They have no limit as to what you can pile onto your pizza. We were extremely happy with the product and value of the main course.  For desert we had the Pookie. A chocolate chip or macadamia nut cookie served in an aluminum pastry sized plate with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Although it was delicious, we had the chocolate chip cookie, I feel the cookie could have been a tad larger for the price, but since it was free I am not going to complain.  OVERALL: Good food, nice environment and a friendly staff. This pace is aces. WE APPROVE AND RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!! Here is our VIDEO REVIEW!  https://youtu.be/_I8Si12nEMs"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in town. It's a build-your-own pizz a style, but the workers will give pairing recommendations if you are unsure or don't want to order off their menu selection. The Za pie's are baked to perfection on thin crust. Highly recommend. This place will exceed any satisfaction you have for pizza."}
{"text":"We waited a whopping 1.5 hours four our freebie pizza.  I honestly didn't think it would take that long, but halfway through, we just decided to wait it out.  I'm not sure why the wait was so long either, maybe there are still some kinks to be worked out.   When you enter, the line is on the left side.  Basically you order what you want, just like Chipotle.  Thy have many options to choose from.  I also like the fact they have gluten free and vegan gluten free crust for $2 more.    So as you go down the line, you are offered choices of toppings, you can add as much as you want without being charged extra.  The one bad thing is that if you add so much, your pizza will be a stranger heavy and you have to roll it to eat it.  The crust here is very decent.  A thin crust pizza that I wish was a bit crispier.  Since this was freebie pizza day, I will give it a pass.  Hopefully, it'll be comparable to the pizza at Tanger Outlets.  Overall, this is a much needed addition to this area.  Ambiance and decor was very nice.  Wishing you all the best, Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"I went a little overboard and trigger happy with the toppings.  The end result was a soggy mess of a crust and on top of that the bake time is so fast in their high heat ovens but that don't mean squadoosh its soggy ass crust!!!!!  I picked up a slice and everything ie. Cheese and Toppings slid right off!!!    What I should've done in hindsight was toss it on the sidewalk on a 120 degree AZ surface to crisp it up.  Maybe had I still stuck to a few toppings and light on the cheese  (3 or less) or perhaps Fired Pie just sucks I need to pay a visit to the other players in the trendy fast casual pizza chains doing this concept.  The 30 or so toppings that are available I will say are or appear to be quality.....The small highlight for me personally was the roasted garlic and especially the caramelized onions.  Onions and cheese go together like milk and cookies.  At least I think so.......    Anyways the Verizon Store is across from this location so you can pay your cell phone bill there before you roll the dice dining here and even I had to ask myself how did in my opinion.....just go from leaving a consistent 5 star cell phone co. to a 2.5 star soggy @&$%^!!!  Fired Pie has me fired up alright!  Oh did I not already mention the crust sucks?!  I won't be back at this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is friggin brilliant! It seems like a weird concept to walk into a pizza place and find a \"Subway counter\" but don't you fret. Piled high, nestled next to the containers, are these 1/4\" crusts, made fresh in front of you, sitting on a wood fired oven pizza spatula ready for you to dream up your magical concoction. They have many foundations of flavor to make your dream pie. In my last three visits, I have tried three different sauces, the olive oil and garlic, the red sauce, and the basil, all of which were perfectly balanced and delightfully delish on their own. But wait, there's more! In each of the arrays of plastic containers are a plethora of lip smacking meats (I highly recommend the regular sausage and the bbq chicken!) for you to choose. They have FRESH mozzarella chunks and shredded mozzarella, Fontina, Gorgonzola, Parmesan cheese. The veggies are the coup de grace of the pie; they have fresh and sautéed onions and peppers, wilted spinach, sliced tomatoes, olives (black and Greek) and many others. Now get ready for this...you can select whatever you want and as much as you want on ANY salad or pizza pie, and not be charged more. And wait for it...the crust, once cooked in that wood burning oven, is thin, light, crunchy, and perfectly grilled so as to make your pie just heavenly. The service is amazing as well. Run, don't walk to this place. I double dare you to try the pizza and not go again within a week. It's four snaps in big circles."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I first found Fired Pie when I moved to the area a little over a year ago. The concept is like a Subway or Chipotle, but for everyone's favorite food; pizza! I've been in this location a handful of times and have never had a bad experience. The food, and the service is stellar. You can't beat a custom made personal pizza for under $8."}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant concept. Custom ultra thin crust pizzas that are cooked quickly with quality ingredients.   The salads are also good and generous portions.   Very simple menu, just pizzas and salads.   Beer served."}
{"text":"It says they open at 10am buy its 10:43 now and it's still closed. The guy in there is just ignoring us knocking on the door. Wtf!"}
{"text":"Really good food for the price and quality will  definitely go back endless amount of toppings still  just one price under eight buck's"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Great prices. They have he best thin crust pizza I have ever had. They also have a pretty amazing happy hour thurs and Friday 4pm-close I think. 1/2 off beer and wine!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing every time. I do feel like the local high school sent the kids who needed jobs to the place... But in general it's a great dinner for a reasonable price. Good spot overall!"}
{"text":"Me and my lady absolutely love this place! Every time we go here they do not disappoint. Awesome pizza at a low price. Lots of good choices for sauce, cheeses and toppings. Plus lots of drink choices. Staff is super friendly and even know me and my lady by name. We will frequent this place as long as we live here. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place. Think of it like the Chipotle of Pizza. Personal pizza's at your disposal & get all the toppings you want at the same rate."}
{"text":"Four minutes to cook a thin personal pizza pie.  Very nice.  Interesting toppings."}
{"text":"Always amazingly good! Staff is nice and takes time to get your order, even if it's complicated, perfect :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Like others have pointed out you start with picking a crust and then you can put whatever you want on your pizza for one low cost of ten dollars. The GLUTEN FREE pizza is the best. I like it better then the regular crust. The owners are fantastic and even when they messed up my gluten free pizza twice, the suporvisor Bri handled the situation with ease. I seriously respect her and the business. I will be back and I think everyone should go here. I wish they had one on ASU's campus. It would be so nice to grab a personalized pizza.   All in all LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza and the salads. For those who complain about the thin crust not having much flavor, I disagree totally. The crust is fresh and made each day in Tempe. For those who are gluten sensitive, there is a gluten free dough. Love being able to design my own pizza for under 8 bucks. And this isn't a small pizza either. Keep up the good work Pizza Me!  You rock!"}
{"text":"EDIT: I was immediately contacted by one of the owners after I posted this review, and I am raising my rating due to his thoughtfulness. The fact that he reached right out and offered his apologies for the less than stellar experience, was enough for me to consider his words as sincere.  Original: We have grown to love the pizza here as our family has to eat gluten free, and most places taste like cardboard.  We either order through one of the delivery services, or will call ahead to place an order to pick up.  Unfortunately, we placed our order through Doordash. The order ended up being canceled by the store after a few minutes with no explanation. So I tried placing the order again in case it was accidental, and to follow up with a call to this store. Well.... I tried calling 5 times over this 45 minute period and got zero answer on any attempt.   45 minutes after the order was placed, I finally get a confirmation that our dasher is heading to the store.  The length of time isn't necessarily the issue here. The complete lack of ability to answer a phone in 45 minutes is ridiculously irresponsible.  I refuse to do business with this location again, and will try to use a different location next time to give them one more opportunity, otherwise it will be off to My Pie."}
{"text":"Extremely terrible customer service and I saw cockroaches around their food! Absolutely do not go here! Really dirty place and the employees don't wash their hands either!"}
{"text":"Walked in here excited to try a new pizza place supported by AMAZING reviews. What I saw left me tremendously disappointed. The bottom line: there is too much cross-contamination for people with food restrictions or allergies to eat here safely.  I'm a pescetarian (fish only) and my mom is a vegetarian. We can eat at most places with little trouble. This restaurant would have been impossible.   The quick service build-your-own concept is great. Most places (e.g. Chipotle and Subway) do it well. That's precisely where Fired Pit failed. Everything was done by hand - only the sauce used a utensil. This meant that workers were putting their hands in meat (often covered in sauce) and then putting their hands directly into the veggies (without changing gloves) my mom and I are after. Yuck! We choose not to eat these foods, but the design of this restaurant would force us to come into contact with them.   It's simple to fix this. Employees could change gloves between every customer, and they could use utensils for meat (as Chipotle does) or pre-portion it (as Subway does). Not only would this help standardize serving sizes (reducing overall food costs), it also prevents the very cross-contamination that prompted my mom and I to leave without ordering.  If you have a food allergy of ANY kind, steer clear! Way too much cross contamination. They order gluten-free crusts, but the design of their kitchen leads me to believe that you would likely still come into contact with gluten.   I also watched an employee drop a towel on the ground, shake it off, and go back to using it to wrap around the handle of pizza peels he was shoving into the ovens. While it never came into direct contact with any food, I'm wary of any open-air kitchen that is so cavalier about dropping something on the ground and continuing to use it right in front of customers.   Bottom line: the concept is great, but the execution falls short of what it should."}
{"text":"It's new but I've been here about three times now. I always get a salad and pizza and split it with my girlfriend. The food is great and the speed is fast. I give it a 4 star because sometimes the workers are not the most up beat you could say. They are not rude but seem like the don't like their job I guess ha. Whatever. The foods good. Not the cheapest but not terrible either."}
{"text":"Had the pesto chicken. It was good. I love the fired thin crust pizza. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am sitting in the joint as I type.  It's a great little shop.  Great concept - make your own pizza, thin crust, fired in the oven in front of you.  I have never had an issue with service.  All of the employees are nice, young folks who do a good job at getting your food to you AND trying to keep the place nice and tidy.  They get SLAMMED at lunch but as soon as it calms a bit, they switch gears and wipes down all the tables, doors, glass, counters, their food prep area thoroughly, etc.  I for one, appreciate this quite a bit!  THANK YOU so much for having MULTIPLE flavored but unsweetened teas!  I hate going out and having only soda (we don't all drink it...) and beer (ugh) to choose from.  My husband is a huge tea drinker and hates that 90% of places barely toss a generic Lipton black iced tea out as an after-thought.  They have four flavors of brewed China Mist, including Watermelon Marula, Blackberry Jasmine, Passion Fruit and Traditional Black Tea.  And if you DID want a beer, wine, lemonade or soda, they have those too (a very limited selection of beer and wine but its something).  After reading some of the critical reviews, I will agree that they can tighten things up to make it even better.  However, they are doing it well enough that now we are just making incremental improvements not fixing something that is broken in any way.  1. Better organization during the assembly process. 2. Better timing so multiple pizzas may be placed into the oven at once 3. Sharper timekeeping to reduce the variable in crust doneness (today was the first time mine was somewhat overdone for my liking) 4. Have a separate set of veggie bins for vegans/vegetarians and/or those with food allergies.  Have a scoop/tong in each container to limit cross-contamination.  Have a box of gloves dedicated to this station and switch before touching anything in that area.  Place a BIG sign up asking that people announce any special dietary needs BEFORE they order. 5. Have more food handling training time for newbies.  About the 3rd time I visited, the (obvious) new guy grabbed the refill bag for the fresh garden salad...and placed the bag INTO the drawer that holds the food to open it. O_o  Thankfully, before *I* started in on him, his coworker caught him, fussed, had to clean the entire drawer out (good girl...) and then show him how to properly fill it.  Sadly, these things are NOT common sense to all...  Again, even the items above and nearly splitting hairs.  My family and I love this little joint and while some can do the 11\" pizza as a single serving, my husband and two little daughters can split the pizza and a salad between the four of us for dinner.  Which makes for a SUPER cheap, super yum yum meal with ZERO clean-up on my part!  Keep it fired up!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Thin crust is my go-to. You won't be disappointed. Employees were extremely helpful and cared about my visit. Well worth the drive and will surely return."}
{"text":"I drive out of my way to come here. Being able to create and customize your own pizza can not be beat!"}
{"text":"I do not have one complaint about this restaurant! Everything I have ever ordered here has been perfect! And it is a very very friendly staff! I highly recommend checking out fired pie!"}
{"text":"I had never been here and I was excited to try it. I went during my lunch break with a few coworkers and the place was understandably busy but, the staff was working quickly. After paying for my pizza, I sat down at a table and waited with my coworkers. About ten minutes after they received their pizzas, I went up to the front to check on the status of mine. I was told that my pizza had been \"messed up\" and they were making me a new one and it would be ready in about 15 minutes.  Unfortunately I had to be back to work in 15 minutes so I politely asked for a refund. I was told \"I can give you a voucher for a free pizza instead.\" I said that's fine; we needed to leave. Once I got back to work I was still frustrated because I didn't get the food I paid for and I would have to go back another time to use this voucher. I called and asked for a refund on my card (I was even willing to give the voucher to someone else).  OF COURSE they for some reason could not find my cc transaction anywhere and I had to drive BACK for a cash refund... So, I drove back to this location from Phoenix after work to receive a cash refund. Bri, the manager, the one who rang me up originally, and the one I spoke to on the phone politely gave me my cash refund and ASKED FOR THE VOUCHER BACK. She then proceeded to ask if I wanted a free pizza right then...why offer me a pizza now but not let me use the voucher later? Anyway, this whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth (not sure if the pizza would have because i didn't get to try it). The staff was nice, Bri was nice, but they definitely need some training on hospitality and customer service. Definitely won't be coming back. MOD pizza and Blaze haven't let me down."}
{"text":"Love this place. Casual and easy great for a work time lunch. The worst thing about it is parking as it is right next to a busy Paradise Cafe. The good news is that you can park in the greater shopping center parking. I have been here twice now. First time a co-worker and I split an Italian salad and a pesto chicken pizza with added mushrooms. It was delicious. The 2nd time today I had to choose one or the other and went with the southwestern  chicken salad with the dressing on the side. It actually reminds me of Oreganos Pablo Picasso salad (one of my favorites). Different chicken of course but somewhat same flavors with the peppers, onions and jalapeños on it and a much more manageable size for one person. I do wish they offered a pizza and salad combination for a singular person,  maybe in the near future? I also love that they have four brewed ice tea options with two of them being green tea. New favorite!"}
{"text":"Really quick for lunch, very tasty pizzas and salads, at a great price.  Staff seems to be a bit reluctant to add \"extra\" ingredients even if the pizza is meatless.  The make your own pizzas are one price.  My colleague wanted a simple pizza with extra mushrooms, and the preparer kept adding one or two extra 'shrooms at my friend's urging, and looking back at the manager cautiously.  In the meantime, I had a pie with two cheeses, two meats and several different veggies, and nobody batted an eye."}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy, so my order came fast. Pizza was good. I recommend it. Sometimes the \"kids\" are rowdy behind the line, and playing games, but as a general rule,  its good pizza."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle meets Papa Johns! :)  It was good. I like that they can keep up for a busy lunch hour and give their patrons plenty of time to relax and enjoy a pizza before returning to work. How often do you you get to enjoy a pizza on your lunch break? How often would you like a Pizza on your lunch break? You could go up the street and get a slice of Barros (how long has it been rotating in their?) at the Danny's Carwash for a couple bucks or you could get made to order pizza here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ew. Scrape ur pizza ovens. Such a mess to clean up all the black from my hands that i got as a result of all the char on the bottom of the pizza. There was an off duty employee in street clothes and open toed flip flops that went behind the counter numerous times to get her salad and pizza. Gross. Talk about unsanitary. Love Fired pie, but not a fan of this location. Wont be back here. Hardly any basil on my pizza and there was an onion mixed in. Cant eat onions. Good thing i saw this."}
{"text":"There has recently been a crop of these restaurants in the Phoenix area as far as the make your own pizza concept goes. After having tried MOD Pizza and My Pie I still prefer Fired Pie the best. The main reason being that the toppings they use is of high quality and you can definitely taste the difference.  I would say that Fired Pie is one of the better, if not best option inside the food court right now. I've been here on a few occasions and the pizzas have been very good each time, with me slightly tweaking the options for toppings to get a different pizza. Best part is that you can get as many toppings as you want and it will still be at the same price."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza! The toppings were fresh and there were many to choose from. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and pick up a quick pizza. The ingredients are placed upon your pizza as you watch them put together your own creation."}
{"text":"Place is amazing! Fresh, good prices and friendly staff. They are all kind of young and need to be trained a little more, but it's a new place and I don't go there for the staff. Pizza is fresh and the salads are really good. Tried mods pizza it's a joke compared to this place! I am always worried to order for pick up because the order gets messed up but not with fire pie, always perfect"}
{"text":"Thankfully a local cabbie recommended Fired Pie or we would never have found it tucked in close to the convention center and downtown hotels.  Great value, super yummy pizza. Everyone got to \"make their own\" pizzas, try new toppings, stick with favorites...you name it. Thin-ish crusts with a gf option, the wide variety of choices will please any pizza eater.   We did not try the salads but that might be our next trip, tho the pizzas will be impossible to pass up.  Simple but super effective and delicious...highly recommended for lunch or dinner. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Place is pretty awesome. It's a very unique way to sell pizza. Everything is well priced, and the service is fast. Service is average, nice girls but not all that friendly or welcoming. Food quality definitely makes up for it though! The decor is pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"As a rule I try to avoid any place at peak hours because I deal with enough crowds and annoying people while I'm traveling.  BUT sometimes I forget myself because I get hungry and then it's all over.  I'm goin'.    Over the weekend Mr. M and I went back to Fired Pie and decided we were just going to share their specialty pie called Hawaiian BBQ.   I should have called ahead and placed the order to go, but then I might have missed the floor show.  As we arrive, some dude is out front attempting to back his Escalade into the first parking spot.  I think it took him 6 tries.  He should have his man card revoked.    We get in line behind what looks like a knock-off of the Kardashian women and they are all customizing their pizzas and each half is different.  One of them keeps walking in front of me to go over and get 4-inches from the menu board so she can re-read the choices.  She did this no less than 5 times.    They really need a dude at the entrance selling drinks for cash because by this point, I wanted one, just to help the time pass.    Five minutes into this here comes the dad and brother who happened to be the same dudes trying to park the Escalade out front.  Of course they get in line with their women, in front of us, and proceed to tack on their customized pies.  All told we waited approximately 25 minutes for that group of 5 just to order their pies.    Snoozefest.  I almost forgot why I was there.  I got light-headed and thought I was in the airport for a minute.    But then we finally got our Hawaiian pie and a lovely chilled glass of pinot grigio.  Happy belly and a cheap, good lunch when we didn't feel like cooking.  I'll definitely be back, but at like 2:30 in the afternoon or something!  ;-)"}
{"text":"I adore pizza, but it's something I rarely order alone. Pizza Me makes the process of procuring the pizza quick and fast, so that if you come in your pajamas no one is going to judge you. I may or may not have been wearing monkey slippers on a Sunday afternoon when I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza.   The best part? If it's a little busy, have a beer or a glass of wine while you wait! Their beer selection is fantastic and their wine is on tap. They have \"local\" beers that you would consider craft and seasonal varieties in the case.   Another plus is the soda fountain. It's one of those 1,000+ combination machines that make you want to stay there just so you can try every single flavor possible.   The employees were extremely nice and super conscious of possible food allergies. They have gluten free options, but I would love to see a vegan cheese option on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, had the margarita which was fried to perfection. Too bad i don't live here as this would  be a regular place for lunch. Not too crowded at 12 noon."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time.  My wife has eaten here several times and loves their pizza.  I like their concept that you can have as many toppings as you would like and only pay one price for an individual pizza.  They have a pretty good selection of sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggie toppings.  It is a chipotle style where they build up the pizza in front of you then quickly cook it.    I choose a pizza with mozzarella, extra tomato sauce, sausage, spicy sausage, mushrooms, black olives, spinach, and basil.  They don't skimp on toppings.  The pizza was done before I finished paying since the cashier was having an issue that she had to get a manager to help out with.  The pizza crust is a thin crust and crispy.  I think it could have been a tad bit thicker, but overall, it was very delicious.  I really enjoyed the pizza.  The only negative is that the line is long.  We probably had to wait 20-25 minutes to order.  My wife actually said that the lines at lunch time are longer.  I guess thank goodness we went during dinner time.  Even by the time we left about 8:30, the line was still at the door."}
{"text":"Our GOTO pizza place on Scottsdale! What could be better - made to order pizza and across the street from the Apple Store!!! Get the meatball with fresh mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Fired Pie and the separated at birth MyPie.  I'm glad Fired just opened one 15 miles closer to us.  Lots of great toppings and crisp lavosh style crust."}
{"text":"Oh, now I get it!  Chipotle style assembly with a wood fired oven and Pei Wei interior.  And they have beer & wine.  Neat!  Pizza was excellent, toppings were great.  Nice thin crust pizza, artfully made with everything in the right proportions.  Crisp thin crust, singed around the edges."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I have been here several times and have tried many different pizzas. They are always good. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little place in Park Central. made to order personal pizzas and salads, all for $7.95. Salads are huge, pizzas are made quickly in wood fired oven.  We were there on a quiet Labor Day, but on a workday it would be awesome for a quick lunch.  Food was great - loved the steak and blue salad.  I have to try  one of their specialized pizzas next time - pesto chicken or Hawaiian barbecue.  Oh, you have to try the Pookie - a warm chocolate chip cookie in a little pie pan with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream for only $3.00."}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent food for the cost, you just don't get enough of it, especially if you order a salad to go. Can I not get the same portion of food if I'm taking it to go? It's significantly less salad if you do, and salad is already a cheap cost."}
{"text":"Say hello to chipotle's cousin:)  Fast, fresh, healthy, simple. Best part about it, everything is pretty much 8$. Try one of the store's favorite pizzas or salads or be creative and make your own! Great place, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love it, will be eating there more often. Great vibe, clean and friendly. You can make your own pizza, enough said!"}
{"text":"Ordered a small salad and got a large WITH A BUG IN IT!!! OMG! Didnt discover they gave me the wrong size until I was paying and by then it was too late. Didn't discover the bug until I'd eaten half the salad! Ughhhhh!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Loved that it was one flat price. They gave us the wrong pie and we had to remake ours because they gave ours to someone else. It was incredible food though. It was fast and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"My new lunch spot!!  Had it for the first time about 2 weeks ago and I've albeen back multiple times akready. This place is so good and all their toppings are so fresh. My favorite salad/pizza is the steak and blue. Staff is very friendly and polite. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a fairly new restaurant in Arrowhead. I was super excited for it to open. Initially it was impressive food was good and the surroundings were clean. Unfortunately the restaurant has been steadily declining. The food preparation area was a mess. As a customer I do not want to see my pizza or salad being prepared in an unsanitary area. They do not wipe up spills or pick up food on the food preparation bar. Today, I even saw gnats flying around the food area as they were making my pizza and salad.  My pizza and salad quality was also terrible. I hope you see this review and make corrections. . Otherwise, I won't be back.   Disappointed local customer"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the Pi day special ($3.14 for a personal pizza) only to find out upon arrival that they were limiting customers to one lame single topping pizza with the purchase of a drink. Who comes to fired pie for a one topping pizza? They were also still charging $2.29 extra for a gluten free crust. For two pizzas I had to buy two drinks; when my wife and I usually just share one. Also, I heard a guy who looked like the manager scolding his team members for putting \"too much\" of any given topping. I was expecting an awesome deal from an awesome place, but instead I got a slimy deal from a slimy establishment."}
{"text":"Update: Pizza Me was far worse! in terms of concept and price, Fired Pie is far superior in quality and value. However, at both places, again, the staff just does not put in the effort to deliver the best quality dish possible - it's half assed."}
{"text":"Let me just say this: for this concept and this price - go to Fired Pie instead.   Tried Pizza Me and was thoroughly disappointed. The pizza was just not very good, plain and simple. Bland and tasteless, the crust was like cardboard. And unlike Fired Pie, you really have no control over the toppings, despite the perception that its a Subway-style build-your-own. At least at Fired Pie you can get them to add more of a specific topping you really like, here they make it as they see fit, the customization is a bit of a hoax. I've had frozen pizza from Walmart that tasted better! And the staff, typical of teens, had that could-care-less attitude. In fact, I witness one girl put the carbon copy of a receipt ON TOP of the pizza itself, touching the food. This is incredibly unsanitary, not to mention ignorant of how bad the ink on those receipts are - you aren't really supposed to touch them with your bare hands (look it up, they cause cancer), let alone let it rest on the food you are about to eat! So I kindly politely pointed that out to the girl, and she just shrugged her shoulders and did absolutely nothing. This place is a bit of a joke to be honest, the way they were so careless with the food. I have had many issues with the staff at Fired Pie also, but I will go back there and not to Pizza Me because the quality of food at Fired is vastly superior, and you get a larger pizza for the same price. Pizza Me? Pizza Nobody if you ask me...."}
{"text":"I ordered two pies from here and requested extra sauce. The two pies arrived via Uber eats and both were so dry and almost with no sauce. Adrian answered when I called to alert of the issue. He went right into defense mode and said the rules and regulations don't allow for extra sauce. What??   He provided no other concern for my satisfaction and stood behind the fact that the rules don't allow for extra sauce due to the thin crust. I don't even know what that means.   Don't order from here if you want anything different than how it is prepared."}
{"text":"It was late and we were craving some grub, specifically pizza. My husband didn't want 'greasy' late night pizza so we decided to order Fired Pie! I've tried the other fast pizza concepts and really like them all, and Fired Pie didn't disappoint either! We ordered a build-your-own pizza and an Antipasto salad to split. The pizza was DELICIOUS, we even tried their Vegas cheese and it was tasty! But the salad was the real winner in my book. It was packed with Italian meats, cheese, tons of veggies, and the most delicious Italian dressing that seemed as if it was made in house. I'm honestly craving the salad even now! It was so dang tasty. We'll absolutely visit Fired Pie again. They have multiple locations throughout the Valley so there's sure to be one nearby."}
{"text":"I do like to stop by for a quick pizza to take home. My pet peeve is the dirty tables in the dinning area. It seems no one person is responsible for them therefore no one looks at them. I am giving you 3 stars for the appearance of your restaurant not the pizza in hopes you fix it.   I do love the pizza or I wouldn't come back. Empty the trash and wipe down the dirty tables a little more often please! (I even saw 2 employees on break and after they were done eating they didn't wipe down their own table just removed their dishes and went back to work."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The service was amazing. The food was great. Definitely worth another visit. The toppings are fresh and the handmade dough was very tasty. I really love how quick it is. I had a much harder time finding a parking space here at the San Tan Valley Mall! I even tried Shark Energy drink. It taste a little better than Red Bull, not sure about the energy yet!"}
{"text":"easily one of the best places to go in ahwatukee for pizza. food is always amazing and the staff is always friendly. the general manager is also amazing at keeping the store in order and always seems to be on top of the game!"}
{"text":"Really digging this restaurant!  Solid go-to pizza place in the NW valley for lunch seekers. Great price and value. Made to order pizza just the way you want it.  Love it!"}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here on a previous visit to Phoenix several times, and had nothing but praises for the service  and food. We arrived again yesterday and couldn't wait to get a Fired Pie. After her first bite, my sis said, \"Mmm, this is so worth the trip.\"  I love the thin, crispy crust, and the toppings are fresh and flavorful.  We got the Fired Italian salad and it was so fresh and crispy with the right amount of meat and cheeses. The staff was upbeat and friendly. Our order was ready when I arrived in less than 10 minutes from the time I placed the order. I highly recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Wow this will give Oreganos a run for it! Best pizza ever! I got the pesto with sausage, olives, tomato, bacon, green pepper and cheese. Crunchy crust, perfect seasoning."}
{"text":"Such a convenient location! Before or after shopping this place is the place to be. Food was delicious. I made my own pizza. Ingredients were: pepperoni, bacon, red onions, peppers, artichoke, half mushroom and half olives. I must say it was to die for! The taste was incredible. First time trying this pizza and I will most definitely come back. The customer service was superb! Very attentive. Make sure you leave enough space for that super uber delicious pizookie."}
{"text":"Imagine subway style ordering for pizza.. You start with a crust and choose your sauce and toppings.  Located in Scottsdale mall, it was a little busy when we went, in the afternoon of a weekday. I was getting pizza for my kid, so kept it simple with tomato sauce and cheese.   Ordering is kinda fast paced, but friendly service overall. Paid at the register, and it only took a couple mins to be ready, even with several orders ahead of me.   A decent size for single serve pizza, maybe 10\", idk for sure.   What i noticed when I took a bite, was the yummy mozzarella. Good quality and nice flavor.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Obvious cost control efforts underway. Skimped on the sauce and had to ask them to put more thank one jalapeño per slice. Hope they return to their old selves."}
{"text":"outstanding.  great service, great toppings, amazing concept.  price is right as well.  kudos."}
{"text":"I have never been into their actually restaurant, because I always order from here off Uber Eats. Their food is good and they seem to get my orders correct every single time. Every now and again their crust is a little too burnt though. But all in all a great affordable delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Super good pies!!! Came here for national pi day. You customize your own pie or salad. They had a special for pi day, a pie for $3.14 but you need to buy a drink as well. There was a lot of people. You should definitely try it out!!! Also you get cash back from yelp if you link your card!  So good. You can put unlimited toppings on your pizza! It doesn't feel greasy as other pizza places. It's about $9 for a pie."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! We went to their free pizza night and not only was the people watching hilariously amazing, but the pizza was actually worth waiting for. You can make a custom pizza, or choose from their originals. The pizza is quick and tasty, and they ingredients are quality, yet under $10/person."}
{"text":"Lord almighty, Fired Pie opened my eyes to a paradise I never believed existed, until I stepped foot into this location. The service is always speedy and it couldn't be easier to pick your toppings as they are right in front of your face. Love the scenery by the water, I almost took a swim but left my suit at home. Will be back with a boat. Thank you Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Good fast pizza that is quick fired. Easy to run in for high quality ingredients. Beer and wine available. Perfect for pre movie dining."}
{"text":"The concept of this place came from some guys that put in some time at California Pizza Kitchen. It's pretty similar to Chipotle or Subway where you choose your toppings and they make your pizza in front of you. You can choose your crust, sauce, meat, cheese and veggies. They fire it up in a wood-fired oven and it comes out pretty quick. This place is great for families. My kid is pretty picky and it's nice that he got to create his own pie while I got to load mine up with my favorite toppings."}
{"text":"Tis food place is good .. I like the customize concept of choosing own veggies, meat wtc to hv pizza .. Loved the food"}
{"text":"My husband likes this place and we had just watched a movie next door, when our little girl started saying she was hungry.  She didn't want to wait to go anywhere, so we stayed.  I had a slice of my husbands pizza and a southwest salad.  As usual the twins had a cheese pizza.  The salad was ok and the pizza was good, but nothing special.  I like other crusts better, but that is my opinion. In a pinch, this is a good place.  I just wish they had ricotta cheese."}
{"text":"I have noticed a lot of these pizza places popping up trying to provide the Chipotle experience with pizza and Fired Pie is by far the best one I have had so far.   Tons of toppings to choose from as well as good dough to make the pizza.  The only knock I have is I waited the longest out of a group of four and I was the first to order which is a pet peeve of mine.  Other than that Fired Pie beats Pizza Studio in the express pizza war."}
{"text":"All pizzas are the same price regardless of toppings. They just give you a bit less of each if you want a lot of different ones.  Salad is the same price as the pizza.  You get a lot for your $7.95. Pizza was really good but not the best Ive had. Salad was great and huge.  Pizza dough is also pre warmed as you order (little press thing) so it was really quick.    All in all, we'd go there again an recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We have frequented this location both for dine-in with the kids and take out. We have consistently had good service. It typically isn't very busy, so you will be in and out in no-time. They are generally friendly. Best part is the price - you can get your pizza anyway you like (as many toppings as you like) for $8. Their salads and deserts are also excellent. We will continue to return."}
{"text":"I can not believe I haven't reviewed this place. I was sure I had. To me, Fired Pie is the best build your own, in and out, type of pizza place there is. They are constantly busy, their ingredients are always fresh, they are always fast, the restaurant is always clean and bright, and my Pizza's are always perfectly cooked. My only complain is that their employees are always sweet but they don't quite listen and seem distracted. They are always all very young so I will give them that. They still do a good job.   I love the fact that you can get any personal sized pizza with whatever you want on it for 7.99. You can build your own, pick one from their board, and or do 1/2 and 1/2 on one pizza all for the same price and then your pizza is brick oven pizza, done in 7 minutes. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Decided to use Pie day as an excuse to try a new to me place I split a 1 item pizza with a friend and had the soda all for somewhere around $5.00 as the Pie day special.  The sauce was minimal but most because I got the last scoop out of the bucket, fresh mozzarella was my topping choice.  Nice thin crust but not too crispy like a cracker it was just right and splitting a pizza was filling enough.  Look  forward to the next visit where you can choose whatever and how much topping you want."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! Close to my work so it's easy and quick to run over and get a delicious pizza for a great price! Staff is always helpful and quick to greet customers as they walk in!"}
{"text":"Loved this place the foods was incredible and the service wss great. Will deffinitely bring my family here. And clean overall i love it"}
{"text":"YAAASSS omg fired pie is my new favorite pizza place of all time. It's fast and I love how I can choose as many toppings as I want. It's such a great place to go and it's super affordable. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Had Fired Pie for the first time in Phoenix yesterday but it was so good, I had to try it again today in Chandler.   Arrived at 12:30 PM on a Tuesday and there were 25 in line with another 60 already eating. Wow. I made it to the front in 15 mins.   I ordered the same pie as yesterday: tomato sauce and pesto, mozzarella and fontina, pepperoni and spicy sausage, onions, jalapeños and garlic. All these toppings: $7.95. Could've had more but it was perfect.   Each pie is about 12\" and thin crust. The crust comes out crisp but flexible enough to fold, if necessary. The toppings were perfectly cooked and the sauces/cheeses were just the right amount.   I can't think of anything else they could do to improve this except open more places so the line gets shorter. Close to my house in Phoenix would be appreciated!"}
{"text":"First time at this Fired Pie but several visits in the valley.   Arrived at 5:15 PM on a Thursday and there was no line, which was unusual for this place. I ordered two pizzas, one for me and a gluten free for my wife.   We both got pepperoni, spicy sausage and various veggies, along with marinara and pesto sauces, mozzarella and fontina cheeses (unlimited toppings for $7.95, +$2 for gluten free crust).  The pies came out bubbly and nicely toasted. The veggies were fresh, the meats were plentiful. The sauce had good aromas to them.   I highly recommend Fired Pie for an inexpensive, flavorful pizza."}
{"text":"First time at Fired Pie today. Met my daughter for lunch. We arrived at 2:00 PM on a Monday and there were about 8 other tables. Good sign to be this busy after the lunch rush.   I ordered a pie with tomato sauce and pesto, mozzarella and fontina cheeses, pepperoni and spicy sausage, jalapeños and onions. Forgot to get fresh basil on top. My daughter ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built, paid and filled our drinks within seven minutes. The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.   I'm not a thin crust guy. Never liked it, never will. I don't like deep dish either. I prefer regular, Hungry Howie's-type crust but thin is all they offer at Fired Pie.  We ate here because I just got laid off and I wanted a cheap meal for our weekly dad/daughter date. All their build-a-pizzas are $7.95.   Wow, I found a thin crust that I love!  It wasn't \"cracker crisp\" like I've seen at other places, thank goodness. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce-to-crust ratio was spot on. The toppings were toasted and flavorful. You guys nailed it!    Came home tonight and told my wife all about it and she wants in on the pie!  Our other daughter, who has celiac disease, can't eat here. Even tho they have gluten free dough, they prep it on the same boards and cook it in the same ovens, which is bad for celiac sufferers."}
{"text":"Fired Pie just opened this week on Baseline and 24th St. Been to several other FP with great results. Service was slow but they're still learning how to make them.   My pie was excellent as always. It's unlimited toppings for $7.95, so definitely a cheap date.   I recommend Fired Pie, once they get their legs under them. Trust me, it will happen cuz they're good pizzas. Build it and they will come."}
{"text":"love me some Fired Pie.  So they took over Pellini's spot, which I was extremely upset when I found out they closed.  Fired Pie keeps the layout of Pellini's, which is basically a Chipotle-type assembly line but for pizza and salad :) my coworker and I tried it out one day and was instantly hooked.  I've tried both the pizza and salad and both were delicious! They have a fixed price for pizza and a fixed price for salad, no matter if you choose the custom or the house recipe, which is really nice considering most pizza places charge you about $0.50 to $1.25 for toppings!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I can probably come here for pizza everyday and not get tired of it:) I also like the soda machine (try the cherry, strawberry sprite mix) so good!"}
{"text":"Love the girl with tattoos don't remember her name but she's lovely. Hate the girl with brown hair and mean attitude, also over lines her lipstick looks like sauce on her mouth. Anyway, the food is the best ever but the teenage girl at the cash register needs a little help being less uptight."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Chipotle but for pizza! Oh and you get to pick all your own topping and the sauce of your choice for only $8"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who lives in CenPho. It's more or less a Chipotle version of a pizzeria. You choose your ingredients and they make your pizza from them. Very nice concept and hard to go wrong when you can see and choose what you want. The service is good and the pizza crust as well. We took an Italian salad as an entree and it was apparently a one person portion but easily fed two. I would have honestly never had gone had she not heard about it and hopefully when it's a little more lively and more recognized it can get a bit more street cred and busier (I'm one who favors a good lively restaurant atmosphere as long as you can talk to each other."}
{"text":"This is the spot for a quick, tasty, personal size pizza pie or salad. They have several cheese, and sauce options, and any and all toppings you could possibly want on a pizza. They even have pineapple for all the pineapple lovers out there.  The place is kept very tidy and the staff is friendly and helpful. Luigi the general manager here even joined in with out jokes. It is seriously the quickest pizza you have that is also delicious."}
{"text":"I love the concept but when on jury duty downtown Phoenix I had pizza in a restaurant style identical to this from a restaurant called studio pizza and it was delicious it didn't even compare to fired pie. the crust doesn't have the same delicious flavor at fired pie and I just wasn't impressed. I would never go back to fired pie. Now I would drive all the way down to Phoenix to go to studio pizza because of their recipe and ingredients...something is just different the crust is amazing and the flavors are just delicious.  So sorry to say but I wish studio pizza would've moved in there instead of fired pie"}
{"text":"This place is great when you want to fast pizza especially a gluten-free options. I got gluten-free herb crust with fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, fresh vegetables, and garlic. This is this subway or Chipotle of pizza. If you have hungry kids, this place is great because you get your pizza very fast.  I would give this place five stars for what it is, but the cleanliness of the place needs to be updated. There is a bit crumbs and paper trash on the tables and floors."}
{"text":"This is fast food style pizza. There is nothing authentic or tasty to their pizzas. It's fun to design the best pizza. It tastes good. The crust and sauce are average at best. The ingredients are fresh. Went once and had an ok time.never went back. Making my own pizzas for 25 years now. I'm into excellent pizza. This is good and absolutely nothing to write home about. In NEW YORK THIS WOULD BE A 2-3 star pizza store. Here no one has the luxury of comparing it to the best so they rave about average. Not sorry we tried it. It was a unique experience and average good. Sorry way many more way better pizza stores in ARIZONA. Just dig deeper in the reviews"}
{"text":"Must try! Great concept, it's like a subway for pizzas. Crisp crust, any toppings and cheeses you want. Then for the price, great value. Def going back for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is great but you'd better like thin crust and I do! The crust is nice and crunchy.  You choose your own toppings. Sausage (regular & spicy), chicken (also regular & spicy), pepperoni, veggies traditional a urban tastes!  They have dalads too, you can choose from their standards or build your own! I always build my own. My coworkers say it ain't pizza without meat,  it's always pizza without meat to me., I love it!"}
{"text":"The Boy was \"Starving\" and wanted to check this place out. It was Okay, I would never go out of my way to come here though. It's the trendy \"Subway\" style of building your order and then waiting for it from the oven. (Yawn) Just because you have total freedom to build whatever your heart desires, doesn't make it great if the ingredients are mediocre. He did a veggie with pesto, I had sausage with pepperoni. The meat was a little bland, the sauce was below standard. The crust was okay. I liked his veggie better.  If I am \"Starving to Death\" (Oh the drama) like my son and Fired Pie is one of the options, I might try it again. But I wouldn't get the sausage & pepperoni."}
{"text":"Not our favorite Fired Pie. The service wasn't as friendly as Chandler, the restaurant wasn't as clean and they didn't have watermelon tea . My husband only ate half his pie and didn't bring the rest home which is downright odd! The Caesar salad was good but loaded with more croutons than lettuce."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. Rory is always so smiley and urgent! Her tenacity and willingness to make sure every guest is happy is quite remarkable. The food is always wonderful, and all employees are clean and friendly.  Great job Fired Pie on building a great team! I will definitely come back time and again!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected and more. First time visiting the restaurant. Had a bite of my sons pizza at the mall previously and thought it was delicious. Decided to come in and try it here near my house. We got 2 small salads which by the way where big enough for me to fill up on. However, I didn't finish to have room for the main event. I ordered a custom personal pizza. Olive oil with fresh garlic first. Topped with tomato sauce then shredded mozzarella then thin sliced steak then sliced red onion then sliced grilled onion then tasty sun dried tomato . After firing it up in the open, it was perfection.  The smell of that garlic and oil base was truly the best idea I had all day.  Try it with your creation.  The staff was young but friendly.  We also had a couple of glasses of pinot noir and was just what we needed.  The pizza came to the table just in time.  We will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a movie. Clean. Staff was friendly. Pizza was awesome. Good quality ingredients.  The spicy italian sausage was actually spicy. Cheese was of good quality.  Only con.. They do not deliver. Crust was thin and and crispy. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Make your own pizza for $8.  Simple and easy.  My favorite is the meaty Italian with artichoke, roasted tomatoes, red onions and olives."}
{"text":"Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!    I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing \"a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ...\"  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes.   This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, \"Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!\"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700° F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!  The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10\" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.    I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.    The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra.   So Three and half Stars+ and we are a Fan!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  My boss took me here for lunch once. I was hooked! Fast, affordible and unique.  Great food"}
{"text":"The service was much faster than the downtown Phoenix location off Central. The servers were friendly. The pizza came out perfect. Definitely get one pizza per person. Lol my boyfriend thought we could split one. He underestimated my hunger. I would recommend this place if you are looking for something fast casual. They do have beer options. Great place to stop before spring training game."}
{"text":"So the 3 times I have been here of course I have not been disappointed.. this place is like a Subway but with Pizza. Oh and Salads. You can create your own or order from their original pizzas. They have a great variety of toppings and sauces to choose from. The dough is pressed in house no frozen stuff. And they of course have Gluten Free crust. Definitely new pizza spot. These are all personal pizzas btw."}
{"text":"Fresh unique and well priced a great place to go for a quick bite. We eat here every time we are in the city. The whole family likes it. Good, quick and convenient."}
{"text":"I've always had mixed experiences here, more negative than positive.  One time I went in and it was right before rush hour. I go down their line, and wait. I wait, and I wait. After wondering where the hell my pizza is after 20 minutes, I keep track of who orders and when they got their food. After someone who got their pizza 15 minutes after I had ordered mine first, I asked them where my pizza was. They wrote the completely wrong name, and instead of maybe asking around, they set the pizza behind the register. They gave me my pizza 50 minutes later, and I was said \"well it won't be warm.\" The man working said \"oh, it will be fine,\" and I got home and guess what? It was cold and I had to reheat it.  Another time, they forgot to make my 'pookie.' At least then, they gave me a coupon for a free pizza.  My last bad experience was during lunch time on a weekday, and one of their workers was giving me sass because I 'ditched' school (I had no class that day, which I mentioned when she asked me how my day was.) Apparently, she is my mother and believes I should've gone in.  The pizza is good, if a bit hard/crispy most the time. I would definitely pay extra for crust like Dominos or Barros. I come here when I need something quick and easy, but for pizza quality/taste there are many (chain) places nearby that are a lot better, if a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time and liked it so much we went back the next day. They offer several cheeses including fresh mozzarella as toppings. The tomato sauce is fresh and with a slight sweet flavor. We love the garlic and oil sauce, I enjoyed the buffalo sauce but thought Alfredo was very 'meh'. The crust is a thin 'cracker' crust cooked to perfection.  They have a gluten free option too!  It all comes together in an incredible pizza experience.   You can choose a nice variety of sauces, cheeses and meats. If you're not into pizza, there's wonderful salad options too. Being an avid water and iced tea drinker, I was personally pleased with 4 delicious tea options.   We have previous been to Mod pizza and Sauce. It beats Mod hands down and is even better than Sauce. They each have similarities but when it comes to flavor, this place is the clear winner."}
{"text":"I liked it! Great concept, executed really well. Quick turnaround for lunch given that each pizza only takes 4 minutes to bake. I liked that you can do however many toppings you want for a fixed price. The size of pizza is more than enough to fill up one person - I actually left a slice (I could have finished it because it was delicious, but that would have meant food coma after lunch). I liked that I could see all the ingredients right there in front of you and they all looked very fresh, and tasty.  They also have liquor license, so it could potentially be a dinner place, but I really see it more for lunch and for those who like a cold beer or glass of wine over lunch, it's available!  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while shopping at Fashion Square and visiting Santa with the kids. My son loves pizza and had not tried Fired. We got him a personal cheese and he loved it. I tried a couple of bites and was very delicious. My son ate the entire thing. Even the crust, which he never does. Will for sure go back."}
{"text":"All the pizza is always sooo good. I had to wait for quite awhile last time I was here but that was mostly because the person in front of me was ordering for five people that didn't know what they wanted. But other than that this place is the best. I love the pesto chicken"}
{"text":"Well Happy New Year everyone!  I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: \"Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him\" well!    Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.  I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding sauté onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.  There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an \"ultra thin\" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan."}
{"text":"WOW! What a great experience we had visiting Fired Pie! I noticed this place as an up-and-comer here on Yelp and boy, you yelpers didn't let me down!  Located right next to the Starbucks by the Deer Valley 30, this little gem is a definite winner!  We visited as a party of 7 and we had a great time! What a novel concept-- pizzas are made to order with your choice of cheeses, toppings, sauces just like you would order a meal at Chipotle or Subway...and you just can't go wrong! Whether you build it yourself or order one of their signature pizzas, I'd be surprised if you found a choice you didn't like!  I love thin crust pizza so much and this place has just the right thickness--not too doughy but not paper thin either!  The kids running the counter were super helpful and knowledgeable. The general manager stopped by to check on us and he was very pleasant and recommended the cookies for dessert which were awesome!  My husband has been back with the boys a few times and loved it each time. I can't wait for my next visit...which I hope is VERY soon!  Absolutely LOVED it!"}
{"text":"I've only been there once, before a Diamondbacks game, last April! It seems decently priced.   Scott and I shared a pizza, and it was quite good!  Well, that's it for now! Ciao til we meet again! :-)"}
{"text":"Wow don't really know where to start. I have been eating Mod pizza for a couple years now so I thought I would expand my horizon and try fired pie. My first impressions when I walked I. Was that the employees didn't really care to interact with the guest. One employee helped me through the line and about 4 others where standing in the back of the house. No one interacted with me or made me feel wanted like I experience each and every time I am at Mod pizza. I did not like that they only had one size pizza because my kids were forced to get a big pizza. they dock every pizza so there was no air bubbles to cook my crust properly. This left me with a soggy very oily pizza. Even with a pizza I didn't enjoy I felt as though the employees could have made my experience better. Very disappointed and will stick with Mod pizza."}
{"text":"Like MOD pizza just not as good.. the pizza isn't terrible but it's not great.  Comparing to MOD only, the prices are higher, the topping quantity isn't as much and it's a very slow line to go through..  Everyone is friendly enough, but if you're in a hurry I wouldn't recommend.  Not a bad spot for northern phx where there aren't as many options. I've been here twice now but I will just drive a little farther elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"If I had to intake carbs, pizza is my second go to after pasta. Fired Pie is a great chain where you get a personal size pizza or salad for under $9. Choose varied options or make your own. I prefer the Hawaiian BBQ substituted with fresh basil or the chicken pesto. It's perfect if you love thin crust, on a budget and in a hurry. This little location is a jaunt from my office. Never busy, staff is friendly, and food is consistent bc you are the chef of your choice own pizza. If you have the leisure time, you can grab a beer with your pizza and enjoy the patrons coming and going. Why not make time for what makes your soul happy?!?!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, one of the better Fired Pies too. Probably our top 2 of all the FPS we've been to. It's hard to find behind the construction, especially at night without a light on the standing sign, but it was worth the hunt! We actually had to call them, we passed it 3 times without seeing it."}
{"text":"Being from NYC I was skeptical to try the pizza. The cool thing, for one decent price, you make it the way you want walking them through the process. I had pesto sauce,  reg. mozzarella,  buffalo mozzarella,  fontina, spinach and kalamata olives. It was delicious. One of the best I've eaten west of NYC. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"My only complaint here is the lack of seating.  When it is busy it can be hard to find a place to sit and eat.  Other than that, I really like their pizza.  I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Is this the best pizza in the valley? No, but it is very good. It is a great local place to take the family. We all can pick whatever we want, as much as we want on our pizza. The pizza is cooked quickly and delivered to your table by a friendly employee. The price is reasonable and the service is great. Even when the owner makes your pizza he isn't shy about how much he uses.  This is a regular dining place of ours. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place,  best make your own pizza.  Meats,  veggies all fresh.  Thin crust the best."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Fired Pie and this store is a nice addition to the Tanger outlet area considering there is not really anything in the way of actual eateries there beyond snacks. The store is new, the staff is new so give it a chance. I love the concept of building my own salads and pizzas just like at Chipotle or Subway. Looking forward to going back! Pizzas were very good though and the roasted veggie salad was a perfect blend. Looking forward to improvements on the comfort level of the staff with the product and the place will be great!"}
{"text":"I was at Fired Pie today for a Chandler Chamber of Commerce event. This place is awesome. Their food is fabulous, and fast and the price is extremely reasonable. I shared the field greens salad with grilled veggies and the pesto chicken pizza. Both were wonderful. Considering they had over 50 people arrive at the same time, I was blown away at how efficient they were and how good everything came out. Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Fired Pie we have been to and are usually big fans of their food.  Our pizzas tasted quite different than other locations. They didn't have the thin cracker crust we are used to. The crust was soft in the middle and burnt on the edges. We wondered if this is due to the over, that was left from the previous pizza joint that was at this location. Also, my Hawaiian BBQ pizza lacked flavor. I'm honestly not sure why... maybe there was too little sauce? Maybe it was the odd crust? Whatever it is, we were THRILLED to have one close by but just weren't impressed. We will drive back to the one off Ray in Chandler for our Fired Pie fix."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG fan of this place. It's basically like a Subway except for pizzas (they have salads too - whatever). Only one size crust, but from that point you can choose precisely what you want on the pizza, from several sauces, several different kinds of cheese (fontina, fresh or regular mozzarella, more), about ten different meats and plenty of different veggies including caramelized or raw onions, artichoke, black or kalamata olives. You can have them load your pizza with as many or few toppings as you like, they artfully arrange the items on top of the pizza base for you and then once you're done ordering they fling it in their giant oven and it's ready in generally about five minutes. The pizzas I've had them build are usually delicious, but unfortunately the last time I was there they slightly burned the crust. My one minor complaint only has to do with how absolutely NUTS popular this place is. A couple of us walked down at just after 11am to see if we could beat the lunch rush. 11:10am, there were about 20 people already in line. In the 15 mins that it took to get to the end of the line, order and have our pizzas in the oven, enough people had arrived that the line was out the freakin' door. Fired Pie just has an absolutely winning formula; long as they get the bake timing right the pizzas are fantastic and for a great price. They need a second oven though. Desperately.  A rare 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! It's like a subway for pizza!  Came here to eat even though we were having drinks at Cafe Tranquilo where the food is not worth the price, sadly. Anyway, great food great prices. And they have wine and beer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The pizza is exactly what you want (thin crust, mind you. If you want thick crust look elsewhere), and they don't charge by the topping which is great.  You can do the same with a salad.  This place gets CROWDED at lunch. I mean line up against the door or even out the door.  Take a dose of patience."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and salad. It's just the kind of competition that the other pizza chains need. Reasonable prices and quick service."}
{"text":"We live in the apartment complex next door and this location has become a favorite of ours. The pizza is always fresh. Employees are all friendly. Tonight we met Luigi who delivered our pizza outside and put a smile on our faces. We love this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in at lunch time after seeing this place on the \"new businesses\" section on the Yelp homepage.  The map seems to be off, this place is located next to the AMC 30 and Starbucks at the Deer Valley Town (Towne?) Center.  I was reluctant at first because the only other pizza joint like this I had tried before in North Phoenix (I forget the name) missed the mark pretty bad (over priced and not filling).  The set up is straight forward, any pizza or salad is $7.75.  They have a few pre-built options, otherwise you can build your own.  I went the build your own route and rattled off a few of my go-to toppings. There was plenty more options and it would be nice if there were labels or a cheat sheet as I might want to get a little more adventurous in the future. I didn't feel like being the \"what's that?...and that?...and that?\" guy.  The pizza itself took only a few minutes to cook and seemed to be just about the right size for a lunch portion (I could have saved a bit for later but was exceptionally hungry). The staff was very helpful and friendly, and after reporting back to folks at the office I'm sure I'll be returning sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Build your own thin crust pizza for a very reasonable price!  All pizzas are 11\" for $7.95.  You tell them exactly what you want on it - type of sauce, cheese and toppings.  They build it right in front of you and it then goes into the fire oven for 3 minutes!  You can also get a build your own salad for $7.95.  The dessert was awesome as well. Big chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top for $3.00! We will definitely be back!  Oh, and they are open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I really enjoy all of the options available.  We love the southwest salad, and I especially like the bbq Hawaiian."}
{"text":"I love the idea and execution of custom made pizzas.  The pizza was delicious and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  I am a fan of this place and will be back.  The place is cool and happy."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and boy was I impressed. I came in at the tail end of the lunch hour. The staff was top notch, all the items were stocked, the iced tea was full, and my wait was barely a wait at all.  The food was hot and delicious. You can pick all the toppings and you have the benefit of seeing your choices in front of you.   I will try a made to order salad next time."}
{"text":"Hours that are posted are wrong and when we walked in an unlocked door and got all the way to the counter to tell them what we wanted to order then got looked at like we had a third eye and told that they were closed like we were idiots no costumers service was displayed at all"}
{"text":"Pizza Me is a nice place to relax and watch a few moments of the game on their big screen HDTV while chewing on your pie.   The key takeaway for Pizza Me is that their prices at are comparable to Fired Pie on Northsight or My Pie near PV Mall, around $7.50-ish. It's your standard flat 8\" pie with fresh toppings on top. But like anything made with yeast, the taste is in the crust and here, their pie is just okay.  We ordered two pies, one Regina Margarita and the other their meat lovers.  Topping were on the light side (see photos) and the crust somewhat crunchy and burnt; not soft or chewy as one might expect.  The folks behind the counter were very friendly and if we were grading on that alone this would be a five star review, but...  Expect to pay around $10 each including drinks, more if you have a salad as we did.  We added a small tip to the receipt, but this is an order and sit down type place.  When your pies are ready, they call out your name and deliver the pizza to your table.  Nice."}
{"text":"Went to see a car show nearby and noticed this joint was within walking distance. It had a sort of Smashburger-esque look to it on the inside; sleek yet welcoming. The staff were very friendly and had great positive attitudes. I ordered their Italian pizza and subbed mixed peppers in for sausage (there are no limits on toppings or substitutions). I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted the pizza. It was excellent. I would absolutely recommend this joint and plan to return again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Never had been to fired pie before. Counter help were extremely helpful and courteous in explaining how things work.  We were impressed with the quality of the salad and pizza.  One big suggestion if your having a salad ask for your pizza order to be held until you finish your salad, as it only takes 3 minutes to cook a pizza here.  Looking forward to going back.   Have been back several times. Excellent. Best salads in the Valley $9. Pizza really good. Unlimited ingredients all for $9 or $11 for gluten free.   Have eaten here around 15 times since they opened and never had a problem until tonight.   Food is really good but had some very incompetent people working there who couldn't even make a salad. Manager Gabe came over and started yelling at us.   Owners need to know this as word of mouth travels fast in Scottsdale.   Really good food. Never had a problem before. Need to train their people better and fire this manager.   Fired Pie was really busy tonight. The employees were great. Apologized for the wait which I didn't think was bad. They were very professional.  Food as always was excellent. Still think they have the best pizzas and salads in town at a very reasonable price.  Nice evening with friends.   Nice seeing Fired Pie retaining their help. Excellent service the last two weeks"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but the staff is just plain rude. So many young kids working here with no sense of customer service. I'll just take my business Mod Pizza where they have more options and a better staff."}
{"text":"Delicious, fantastic, amazing, delicious pizza and quick!  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is the -gross out alert- the bathroom was dirty."}
{"text":"Wowzahh unlimited toppings are you kidding me!My pizza was amazing. If in the area it is a must. I will see you soon yummy pie."}
{"text":"Damn! It looks like I am adding a new place to the lunch rotation...  I was a skeptic. I totally understand and appreciate the Chipotle restaurant model for serving food in a quick manner, but I assumed pizza would take a hit. I was mistaken, and couldn't be happier to admit that I was wrong to prejudge.  I've been to Fired Pie a few times now, and I've had two custom pies, and a salad. There is absolutely no way you'll leave hungry. The pies are delicious, and the toppings are fresh...depending on the toppings you get, there's not much room for complaining. As for the salads, they are just as good, and you can load them up to your heart's content. I had their chipotle ranch, and actually had a nice little kick.  Fired Pie took an awesome food, mixed it with a solid restaurant concept, and nailed it by keeping it simple...all while only charging $7.75 per pie/salad! I am a big fan, and I hope they're super successful. Go."}
{"text":"So delicious. One of the best things about this place is that it's a very easy lunch spot to agree on. They have salads and pizzas and the ability to customize makes it so almost anyone can build a meal they enjoy.        This is an assembly line type place. There has been a line every time I've gone but it moves along quickly. The doughs are already ready on pans and you get to the front, tell them what sauce and cheese you want, they pass the pizza tray down and you add your toppings. Pizza goes in the oven and comes out super quick (I could guess an apprx wait time but I'm usually chatting away so it would probably be inaccurate).  The finished product is a personal sized, crispy, thin crust pizza. For those who are watching their carbs you can also get a salad, assembly works the same way minus the baking part. That would be weird.        The best thing about his is they do not charge for toppings so you can always expect to pay around 9 bucks... I retract... The best thing is the delicious food; the second best thing is the price.               My pick is a  pesto pizza topped with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. If I'm feeling adventurous I may add some chicken. If you are reading reviews to try and figure out if you want to go here I highly recommend you stop contemplating, close your yelp app and experience life... by eating this pizza.   ***almost forgot. The restaurant also attracts a lunch crowd from the surrounding offices/business and there is not a lack of handsome well dressed men. I do not object to this."}
{"text":"My fired pie experience was great!!! The food is great! A young lady I believe her name is Tamara is outgoing with customers. She definitely knows how to cook a pizza. This was my first time and she made it very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Quick, great tasting pizza with a wonderful selection of fresh ingredients, and you can add anything you wish! Friendly staff at this location too."}
{"text":"What a find!  This place knows how to make a custom pizza exactly perfect. I've called in orders twice now and the food is hot and ready when I get there. It travels well and tastes amazing.    They don't charge for each topping which is so nice! The price for the pizza is what you see.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great, customer service SUCKS!!!!!!! Owners choose better people for the job or do more training. Will not be back and will let others know not to come here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fired Pie. Also the one in Scottsdale Mall. Whatever you want on it!! The choices are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location in downtown Phoenix!  Consistently good make your own pizza at a very reasonable price.  It was pretty busy Friday night before the Suns game, so that is a good sign that it will make it in this location.  Definitely recommend the Hawaiian pizza...so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and they never disappoint. You can get the pizza anyway you want, it's fast, and the customer service is awesome. Usually the owner(?) is walking around asking how the pie was. Today he asked some kids how basketball camp was going. If you're looking for a quick fix to great wood fired pizza with awesome customer service, this is the place. The prices are great! I can just go on and on...  Try it.  You won't regret it.  PS- They even have watermelon iced tea!"}
{"text":"Great selection, good pizza. I had the pesto chicken pizza which was great. I wish I was better at making my own because the other pizzas at my table were fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened, and the pizza today was the best I've ever had. The tomato sauce seemed improved. It had a bit more tang to it than in the past. this is my favorite pizza in the planet!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the pizza, it did look good, but I had a craving for greens and fellow Yelpers said go here. Well I did and I'm happy happy! I ordered their southwest Chicken Salad and the veggies were fresh and the salad was bountiful. I loved the spicy chipotle dressing and the extra jalapenos they graciously added. Seeing they are about 5 minutes from the office I'll be back. Why not 5 stars you ask? I could have used a little more protein in my salad but I did leave full and I got my fix. Ain't no shame with getting 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went there because the TV advertised National Pizza day or national pie day and they were advertising $3.14 per Pizza when we get there they said ONLY after 2 p.m.  wtf is that,  ripoff The news said that day/morning  We left & will never go back  Im not going to pay $8+ for a very thin & small pizza. Never !!! Very bad business ethics"}
{"text":"Food poisoning... that's all I gotta say. Diarrhea and puking. Never coming back there!"}
{"text":"This might now be my favorite pizza in the area. Made to order, flat pricing. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with an 11 inch pizza for $8 with any and all the toppings you want... Staff are always great and have smiles on their faces 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Customer service was just ok. Food was ok too, but my boyfriend loved it. Not sure if we will be coming back. Def worth a try though."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch. They have good pizza you can build to your liking and salad too. But I got the spicy southwest chicken salad which is pretty delicious. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Set up like a Chipotle but for Pizza. I hope it continues to expand! Great for casual dining."}
{"text":"I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I miss Neapolitan. This reboot isn't nearly as good."}
{"text":"We loved the fast & tasty pizzas and the service was STELLAR! They genuinely cared & checked in with us (even though they didn't have to). Impressed! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"A super healthy alternative to a greasy on the go lunch or dinner choice.   The selections are all fresh, healthy, generous in portion, value priced and high quality. The staff were full of smiles too, so that was great!  The pizza looks delish, but I chose to build my own salad. It was really tasty, and I'm glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Overall, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. The pizzas were excellent, we were satisfied with our salad (not bad, but not amazing... It's a salad) and the staff was on point. I noticed the manager and staff members \"table touching\".   The ordering/payment location is a bit crammed, I bet it's annoying when they are busy. The other thing I saw people struggling with is whether they sit at a table or order from the counter. Nothing is clearly marked, not everyone has common sense.   We'll definitely be back.!"}
{"text":"I love this concept of a quick, make your own pizza.  We stopped in for lunch one day and really enjoyed our pizzas.  The restaurant was nice - inside and out - and the staff was super friendly too.  This place gets packed at lunch, so beware about what time you arrive."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but was so thrown off when I tried to order a small salad. When we got to the toppings I asked for chicken and the employee said, \"No, you can only get chicken on a large salad.\" He refused to do it, even if I offered to pay more. Instead, I was told that I HAD to order a large salad (and waste food) just to get protein as a topping. The cashier admitted this was a \"rule the owners have\" and that \"many people complain about this\" - which further supports the fact that this is a really silly rule. If they were smart they would just say chicken is $1 extra. I refused to order a large salad and I refuse to go here again, based on their silly salad policy."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout. Went for team lunch and everyone liked the pizza !!! You can build your own pizza and salad"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for 7.75!  Again and Again and Again. Wow these guys know how to do pizza and the prices are great! The ingredients are top notch ! I love getting 4 cheeses and like 7 meats! What a great deal. 5 stars all the way here and super fast also! Quality quality quality here is the motto! Every new location I try and every location is 5 out of 5 stars! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for 7.75! Wow these guys know how to do pizza and the prices are great! The ingredients are top notch ! I love getting 4 cheeses and like 7 meats! What a great deal. 5 stars all the way here and super fast also! Quality quality quality here is the motto!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm impressed!!! I like that I can see the choices for the sauces, meats, veggies, cheeses!!! And I like the individual size. I ordered pepperoni, salami, red onions and fresh mozzarella with tomatoes sauce. It was PERFECT! The sauce is slightly sweet which I love, cuz it doesn't have that acidic side, plus it goes soooooooooooo good with the meats and veggies! The fresh mozzarella was a bonus and complemented my selection nicely. Hubby ordered the Meaty Italian with spicy sausage, along with the Naked Caesar salad. I snitched a bite of that and the dressing was very good! His pizza was as yummy as mine!! One thing he pointed out was, the pizzas arrived to our table HOT, cooked thru , but it wasn't the Hot that burns the top of your mouth... in other words - Papa Bear said it was, \"Just right!\"   I highly recommend this place. The staff is friendly and share lots of smiles with ya. Great place"}
{"text":"First visit to Fired Pie. We ordered four pies to go, one gluten free.   Side note: FP has THREE gluten free options; plain, garlic herb, and cauliflower - spoke to this GF foodie's soul!    The service was wonderful, the guys went above and beyond to make our visit great. They offered water cups while we waited, made sure our pizzas were correct before we left, then packed everything  up so it was easily carried out. When we got home we discovered the nice notes written inside the pizza boxes.   The food was yummy. My kids raved at every bite and asked when we could go back. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was clean & the staff was nice. Adrian was very helpful in guiding me to create \"my\" perfect pizza. But man, was it uncomfortable to sit & actually ENJOY this pizza. It's hotter in the restaurant than it is outside & this is ARIZONA. I wish I would've given it more stars but I'm not kidding when I say I walked out of there DRENCHED in sweat. I was sitting there now imagine the poor employees."}
{"text":"To start I want to say Anthony and Laura are doing a kick ass job!  We came in on a Sunday night and discovered they were the only two employees in the building.  Despite a line quickly forming, they did an awesome job making us feel welcome and entertained while getting through everyones orders.  They clearly know what they're doing aand care about the people they're serving.  A wonderful experience.  Only reason for four stars has nothing to do with the service or food, and more to do with the need for more employees."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised - awesome concept, great food!! I had the Meaty Italian, not very meaty, but still tasty. Good service and they have Four Peaks beer!!"}
{"text":"I am pizza traditionalist - to me,  a fired Neapolitan style pizza Margherita is perfect. My husband on the other hand has been known to build pizzas that cost as much as a restaurant filet mignon because of all of the add-on toppings costs that most pizza joints charge.   Because of my husband's proclivity for loaded pizzas, I love Fired Pie. For a very reasonable flat charge they can build you the delicious pizza of your dreams in salad bar fashion. They have enough variety of sauces, cheeses, meats, vegetables & herbs to satisfy everyone. The crusts are nice and thin and the pizza oven is blistering hot so the pizzas get turned out fairly quickly with the perfect balance of crispiness and chew.   They also build custom salads for the same $7.95 flat price but I have yet to partake. I love Fired Pie."}
{"text":"People, support this place! This business is very generous. Just las week they gave free pizzas to EVERYBODY that showed up. I sadly didnt get one because the line was wrapping around the corner and i only have a 30 min lunch, but any place that gives away free pizza and lets you put as many toppings without charging more is the type of place to support. It sends out a great message. Plus, The pizzas are awesome. Today though I was in the mood for a salad. I gotta say... The toppings didnt look like much but they heated up the meat and I added some veggies... It was DELICIOUS... Truly tasty toppings. I dont eat much salads but i'm hooked. Stop by. Its affordable and delish!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  They accepted an order through ubereats more than 30 minutes before they closed.  Didn't make the order and closed and when the driver showed up they told them they couldn't fulfill and the Uber driver had to cancel.  Sad for both parties.  Don't use a service when you can't promise to deliver.  Joke of an operation."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's nice to go to dinner with my nephews and we can all get what we want.  Not to mention the cost is great."}
{"text":"These guys just opened and have a killer idea.  Custom pizza's while you wait, and they are very good!!! They were also kind enough to donate their Grand Opening proceeds to Chandler Gilbert Arc.  This shows not only great pizza at a great price ($7.75 for 11\" pie), but also a terrific sense of community-mindedness.  We will definitely be back!!   Thank You!!  Billy Parker Executive Director for Chandler Gilbert Arc www.cgarc.org"}
{"text":"I adore Fired Pie. Seriously so good. I love that I can call in an order for like 13 of my coworkers and say I need it at exactly 5:03 pm and they're waiting for me with smiles on their faces and food in their hands.   And the pizza. The Pizza! So freaking good. The pesto. The steak and blue. And all for like $8. It's a steal.   Since I work across the street I've come several times and I've had consistently good service.   Definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Heading to the Phoenix Mercury game and really didn't want the same old food of the Arena so I Yelped pizza and came up with this place. It's right behind Hard Rock....very close to the Arena. Walk in and try one if their own or make your own....I ate the tomato basil with spinach and bacon.....delicious....washed down with a Stone IPA all for only $12. Much better than the Arena food.....and I didn't have to wait long at all!"}
{"text":"absolutely love fired pie went in today for lunch original pepperoni pizza. cooked just perfect was fast so I could make it to work on time. now that the day is almost over ran into a problem have food poison"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I've ran restaurant kichens and been trying to perfect pizza recipes for 10 years.   Fired pie not only has great pizza as a whole but they use high quality individual ingrediants that a conisiour can appreciate.  I had some ceasar salad too and it was perfect!  From the dressing to the chicken to the fresh juicy sun dried tomatos i like on mine.  The salad was a 10!  Im very picky and never give these remarks but i think credit is due here.  I quit ordering pizza cause its always terrible!  But after seeing fired pie reviews i thought i would give it a shot and glad i did.  Its refreshing to know that there are people examining ever detail to produce a superior product.   Good food matters and paying 5$ for crap dont fly in my world and nor shoud it in yours!"}
{"text":"I'll start this review with a caveat: I didn't come here for pizza, I popped in to grab a quick to-go salad one night to have at home with our dinner. I don't like pizza that is done like a factory & quickly put through some machine to 'bake'. Again, that's why I am adding a caveat to this review to be fair. It's all personal choices on what one likes and dislikes. Would I get my pizza here? No. Again that's just me. I like true baked pizza in an actual oven, preferably brick! This seems to be 'fired' but industrial and factory feeling . I watched these pizzas coming out in about 5-7 minutes. My review of the salad. I had not ever been here before , so I ordered off the menu and got the Fired Italian. You can build your own though. The girls working seemed as though even though I had stated , 'Sorry! I've not been here before!' as if they were 'put off' by me not getting on with my order. Mind you there was one other couple seated with food and me in this place. My salad was put together and off I went. $8.95 for my salad seemed a decent price for a loaded generous Italian salad: Salami, Capacolli , Pepperoncini, Pepperoni, Mozzerella and Italian Dressing. One of the girls told me I could add to the salad for no additional cost so I asked for Provolone and she said it was mozzerella. It wasn't, but I didn't feel like an argument over cheese was necessary. When I got it home, it was good. Lots of good ingredients. Fired Pie has a few craft brews by the bottle to drink on premises & a seemingly good menu for pizza. Building your own is a cool concept. The service was not that friendly and there was a bit of attitude but the place was clean and efficient. South Phoenix needs a good pizza place... I'm just not sure this is it."}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!! I've been to fired pie before at another location and it was great I absolutely loved it. But this place has terrible customer service. While I was trying to order my toppings I was repeatedly cut off and and after I was done adding my meats I was told that I would not be allowed to add veggies. No where does it say that there is a limit on toppings I was very offended by the comment. I will not be coming here again to this location and will be warning everyone I know."}
{"text":"So glad firedpie was brought to avondale. No other make your own pizza place can compare to firedpie. So firkin delicious  the dough is so good that that's what makes it so much better. Plus more variety of toppings. Highly recommended and the service was great too #pizzaforlife"}
{"text":"Pizza is always better your way!!  Ever have a problem trying to choose what pizza to order? Uncle Frank wants pepperoni. You want vegetarian and someone wants pineapple on the pizza?! Well this place makes everyone happy.  Fired Pie is celebrating this Mesa location as their 20th location in Arizona. They are located on the Southeast corner of Alma School and Baseline with it's own parking lot. What makes Fired Pie awesome is you get an 11\" pizza where you can choose from a preselected pizza or customize it entirely. It's cheaper than buying a giant pizza that no one can agree on for sure.  Since it was their free pizza day I was worried it would be to crazy. Luckily the wait wasn't long, they provided shade while you waited and free iced tea samples outside. They remained transparent and let us know how long the wait would be so we could decide if it was worth the wait. I only waited 20 minutes and it was worth it!  I ordered the Meditterranean pizza without olives. The staff was super courteous as I ordered and piled on the toppings. My pizza was cooked to perfection and the blend of Meditterranean spices was perfect. Fired Pie never dissapointe and this location is perfect. Nice and roomy and relaxing even when it's busy. Now go get your own pizza before it causes you and your boyfriend to break up over whether pineapple should be on pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. Fast service, fresh ingredients. Staff was awesome. Place could have been a little more clean but it was very busy and it was father's day. I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"It is a good Make your own pizza. Have came in a few times. They actually gave us a free pie since they were busy. Definitely a place to try"}
{"text":"I had low expectations coming here but was pleasantly surprised ! The pizza was actually good , and I liked how thin it was making it a nice light dinner . You can also put as many toppings as you want and it's the same price ! I built my own with half red sauce half  pesto topped with mozzarella, salami, pepperoni , garlic and basil ! I will be back . :)"}
{"text":"I like everything about this place.. I can never decide between a buffalo chicken or pepperoni pizza, so I split my pizza down the middle. They never give me a hard time and it tastes great every time! I like their passion tea and always check-in for a free pookie. Everyone I bring here loves it too."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing. Staff was friendly. Could only eat half and they have cute little half pizza take home boxes. Only reason not 5 stars was they had nobody bussing the tables. Several groups including mine had to wipe down the tables. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at fired pie. I was craving pizza at a pretty late hour when they came up on my search as one of the places that was open at that time. I looked up their menu in advance and their pizzas looked amazing, and they had a decent amount of choices apart from the pizzas as well. I decided to go with the chicken pesto pizza, as it has been one of my favorite kind of pizza at other restaurants, and would give me a good standard for comparison. I will definitely say that their food amount is not the largest I have experienced, I was still pretty hungry after their thin crust 11\" pizza. However, the quality of food was great, and it tasted delicious. I am looking forward to trying the other types of pizza they have, including the \"build your own\" kind, as well as their desserts (which sounded pretty yummy based on what I heard that day). :-)"}
{"text":"Went there last night with 2 toddlers. They were so patient with them because they didn't know what they wanted on their pizza. Love this place, have been there many times and it's always great and great service!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch. I make sure I avoid the lunch time rush because sometimes there may be a lack of a waiting space if you want to take it to go.  I never had a problem with customer service and the food is great and served quickly (outside of the lunch rush). They also run a tight ship and will clean up fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Overall:  Decent food that you can customize to what you want, really fast, at a reasonable price.  Prices:  Reasonable.    Food:  Decent, but pretty good for the price.  I'd probably put it at 3 stars if it was much more expensive, but at $8-$9/pizza it's pretty reasonable.  Atmosphere:  Pretty typical new age fast food... alot like Chipotle, Firehouse Subs, etc."}
{"text":"I knew this was going to be a hit right out of the gate. How could you go wrong with a business model like this? Customizable pizzas for $8 served in under 5 minutes. They make the pizza just the way you want it. The toppings are fresh & good. AND you can get an ice cold beer or wine? Its a wrap! Counter to table in 5 minutes. I need a business partner so we can buy one of these. #FreePizza because I own it. The price is cheaper than most \"value\"meals and who doesn't want it their way. Its great for date night, family night(kids will love it) or just a \"I don't want to cook a damn thing\"night, go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and love the pizza. They are big pizzas, more than I can eat in a sitting unless I am starving.  The salads are okay.  I tried the southwest salad and was disappointed that they put cold chicken on it, I am used to the delicious southwestern chicken salads they have at smashburger...but the salad is huge so it is a good value, I just don't care for cold chicken.    The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the staff.  Not friendly, barely say hello and walk around in \"booty\" shorts.  I remember when I worked in fast food there was a dress code (Khaki pants) but apparently it has gotten more lenient for the girls.   All in all, I love this place it is my new favorite pizza place, the atmosphere is very comparable to Chipotle, they just need to work on the staff's customer service skills and maybe roll the shorts down so we don't see butt cheeks?"}
{"text":"The owner of this store wrote a very nice letter to me. Great customer service. I will Give them another try."}
{"text":"It was fun and a cool concept. It was like a subway for pizza! The cheese was great quality but I could have used more toppings and thicker crust. But that's probably what it was only $8. My sister was obsessed with it and loved it. It's a great pizza place tho. I would return."}
{"text":"After a second visit, I am happy to bump up my rating to 5 stars!!   Noon probably wasn't the best time to come, but they get you through that line very quickly. Everyone was professional, friendly and on their \"A-Game\"! My buddy ordered a pizza to go and they offered to put it in the food warmer to keep it nice and toasty while we enjoyed our lunch.   I ordered the tomato basil pizza with mushrooms and it was fantastic. When it was handed to the guy running the oven, he asked the guy to toss on a few more mushrooms. I liked that he took the time to look over the pizza to make sure it was up to his standards.   This location is now in our regular lunch rotation (on days I'm not convinced I should be on a diet)."}
{"text":"Like chipotle for pizza! Fresh ingredients, great price! Love!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite to eat while downtown or before a sporting event! Can't beat the price either for the amount of food you receive as well! Love a good deal."}
{"text":"The pizza is A-mazing!!! I like that I can build my own pizza and the price is great!   However the reason I give this location 3 starts are the employees. They look like they don't even want to be working there. l've worked customer service before, I know customers can suck sometimes or there could be troubles at home but that doesn't mean you can bring it to work or take it out on others. Fix the attitude guys."}
{"text":"The most amazing pizza in the world.  Who else has spinach / Artichoke pizza, so delicious. Super thin crust and so customizable.  I heart Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Seriously, this location ALWAYS has the friendliest staff. On top of that, you get so much bang for your buck! Definitely a go to if you're in the area- for pizza or salad :)"}
{"text":"Such an insanely great value for the food you get! For $7.95 ( I believe), you can get a personal pizza with anything and everything on it...no limits. You get to see it prepared right before you, just how you like it, watch it be freshly fired and delivered to you! This place serves a variety of beverages as well so you can sit down with a beer and enjoy. I thought it was great that there wasn't a \"3 topping, each additional topping $$$$$$\" like most places. The employees were super awesome and were great with my 2 year old who loved helping decide what went on her pizza. I don't know if all the locations are so great, but this one was stunning. Everything was clean, even the bathrooms! No tables even had crumbs! Amazing! Highly recommend. The crust is super thin so you can actually enjoy the toppings without being stuffed with bread. There was also a wide variety of toppings (Fresh mozzarella slices for example) that you don't normally see at a pizza place! I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I have had fired pie about six times and loved . i decided to try a competitor and you guys hands down beet them."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time ever coming here and it was awesome!! Basically a pizza chipotle. I liked the choices in sauces, cheeses, meats and veggies. Customer service is exceptional. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love the place.  Best Buy in town are the salads.  Under$8 you get a tub of lettuce with choice of same kind of toppings they will put on the pizza.  I'm on a perpetual diet and fast food solutions are difficult. I will sometimes order a couple of these salads to have over a weekend.  They also have combinations if you are not creative.  Favorites are roasted veggie topped, the Southwest, and the Italian."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went for the first time today after months of 'wishing' to go!  I love the fact that each pizza is the same price no matter how many toppings. Also love that the crust is super thin and not the thick, over gluttonous crust you find elsewhere.   The incredibly fresh ingredients and great service make this a no-brainer.   Have not tried the salads yet but wow, I can't wait!  Thank you for such a novel idea in a sea of sameness. Well done and very superior taste!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Fresh ingredients. Loads of combinations can be created here. The fact that they have one of the tastiest GF crusts I've ever had is enough for me to recommend the place and keep coming here over and over again! They are happy to clean the oven and they use gloves for GF cross contamination safety.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the original \"make your own\" pizza places. I see a few have died off quickly. This place is really good. I don't know if maybe it was the combination I put on my pizza or was it the crust that made it a 10. Super good here. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"High-end, Flavorful toppings with many options. They only have thin crust though.  I would like to see a slightly thicker chewier crust in a sourdough.  Options create five stars."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE!! The pizza AND salad is TOP quality!!! I would eat here 4 times a week if I could. I like how you can get whatever you want on your pizza without worrying about 50 cents here, 75 cents there. The toppings & veggies are always fresh too. My mouth is literally watering thinking about it. haha"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's like the Chipotle of pizza. They have an assembly line ordering system where you tell them what you want on your pizza, and it's at your table in about 5 minutes. It can't get any fresher than that!"}
{"text":"This has a very Chipotle feel. You choose your toppings and they cook it right up. The ingredients looked and tasted fresh. The pizza was a thin crust and did bubble up. Would I come back. Yes especially for a low cost dinner."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle and Subway style....The pizza was good for what it is and they have gluten free options which is great. The place is cool, fun atmosphere, kind of cafeteria like but the service line is slightly unorganized. I ordered fresh basil on both pizza's (they said they add it at the end) but since it was a different person giving me the pizza's from the one I last spoke to about toppings I never got the basil. Overall, it's a quick way to get a pizza for cheap."}
{"text":"A Very good experience and everyone of our picky eaters were delighted. We will definitely return several more times in the near future. The price was totally acceptable for the quality of food. Manager was very nice and greeted us and offered to retrieve us desert. Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"This is DEFINITELY not typical \"mall pizza\". They build your pizza in front of you Chipotle-style, then throw it in the fire oven for a fast, authentic pizza bake. Crisp crust and great flavor. \"Beef and Bleu\" is fabulous!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give them about 3.5 stars for concept and variety of options available. The quality of food is kind of mediocre. The pizza does not reheat well if you have any left. I'm not impressed with the quality of the mozzarella (I'm assuming the fresh mozz is better).   The reason for the two stars is the service has gone severely downhill over the last few months. Its usually hit and miss here anyway but this last time it was just all around pretty bad.   We get there over an hour before close and they have the toppings table 2/3 dismantled for cleaning. We have to wait for them to finish cleaning before they make our order. Then, there was something off about the artichokes. The black tea was conspicuously absent and I finally asked about it. They guy goes \"oh, I think we must be out of it, do you want me to brew some? (He clearly DID NOT want to do this). The other two tea flavors are not my favorites, but I did try them and they smelled funky. They shortly came and took away another of the teas. People were still coming in and they've got 1/3 of their staff doing just pre-closing stuff. I get wanting to get out of their faster, but over an hour before you close you shouldn't be neglecting and/or inconveniencing your customers.   Think this will be our last visit here."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, nothing exceptional.. salad was good.. I don't think I will order  a pizza next time from here."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot for me and my kids. Toppings are fresh and the staff is nice.  The place is always clean and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Ever had one of those things that you haven't had in a long, long time & you think, I sure hope this is as good as I remember it being. Well, thank you, Fired Pie - you came through once again. An amazing salad with fresh, flavorful ingredients (I love that I can create my own vegetarian salad - from the variety of greens and cheeses to toppings like cranberries and walnuts), exceptional quality and value, and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on a mission to find the best create-your-own pizza joint and Fired Pie made it pretty high on the list! The thing that sets them apart is that their signature pizzas are the same price as the unlimited topping pizzas, just less than $8. Fairly reasonable for an 11\" pizza. The process is effortless. Tell 'em what you want and they make it right there in front of you. They'll even ask if you want to add anything to the already-created ones at no extra cost. I went with the Steak & Blue salad and my boyfriend created a pizza. It was the perfect amount of food for the both of us to share. They were more than happy to accommodate my request to warm up my steak for my salad. You can watch your pizza being 'fired' to a perfect crisp then brought right out to you. And don't forget to claim the check-in offer for a FREE Pookie - their version of a pizza cookie. It is baked to perfection (undercooked, how I like it) with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. My favorite dessert! Great place."}
{"text":"I liked the crust, I liked all of the options. I liked the flavors I created, I just wish there was either a way to give the non meat eaters more substance or a better value.   While all of my co workers opted for some form of a traditional pizza with cheese sauce and meat I wanted to try a flavor punch.  Pesto for a sauce, bleu and fresh mozzarella as my cheese. garlic and katamala olives as my toppings. It was anything but bland and ready in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"These create your own and cook to order pizzerias are popping up everywhere. I'm liking this concept.  I prefer fired up pizzas and it's thin and crispy crusts so I very much liked my pizza here. I loved that I was able to get it half with pesto and half without. You pretty much can customize it anyway you like, subway style.  This is a great option for when I'm craving wood fire pizza but in a more quick service casual setting."}
{"text":"Love love love! We always get the Margherita pizza with alfredo sauce and a Caesar salad. YUM! We have gone quite often and it has been consistently delicious and the staff is very friendly. We're so glad this place has opened up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the greatest experience at FiredPie a couple days ago, thanks to the supervisor Daniel. We weren't planning on stopping by for a pizza. But he got our attention when we were looking at the menu, by greeting us and looking attentive. He was so friendly and ready to help us out. I had to get a pizza. While creating our pizza he made us laugh and feel comfortable picking the toppings. I couldn't ask for a better pizza!!  I couldn't find the parmesan, and before I asked, he offered if I needed ranch or parmesan. I got my pizza back under 5mins. It was delicious like always! Definitely will be returning to this location, and recommending it to my peers."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a casual but upscale pizzeria where you get to be the mastermind behind the pie. Think subway, but for pizza and salads, and with grown-up ingredients!   When you walk into Fired pie, you'll notice the hip and energetic vibe right off the bat. That may not be everyone's style - I'm no hipster myself - but don't let it fool you, this is seriously tasty pizza and is worth sticking around for.   A employee greets you at the beginning of the counter and guides you along as you choose a salad or pie crust (whole wheat is an option),  sauce,  proteins, and veggies. You'll have really nice options like pepperoni, grilled chicken, steak pieces, blue cheese, fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts, spinach, apple, nuts, and so much more. I can't think of a single pizza topping I would want that you won't find at Fired Pie.    Helpful tip: At the end of the counter, you can choose different herbs,spices and seasonings to top your pie once it comes out of the oven. They may not ask if you want them though, so if you do, just ask. I like to get basil on mine.   Once your masterpiece is ready, into the oven it goes - right in front of your eyes! In just a few minutes, they'll deliver to you the freshest, most delicious pie that you can dream up. The crust is thin, crispy, has that perfect stone oven toasty flavor and crunch, and is just packed with flavor. The ingredients are generously applied and super fresh... it's really the way pizza was meant to be!   For those who prefer to choose from a preset pizza menu, there are some great creative options and traditional favorites as well on the menu.  I have heard that the salads are great as well, but I can never resist the pizza enough to give them a try.   Check out Fired Pie - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat for lunch (: also very convenient because I work in the collier center."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!! My mom and myself decided to try this place out and it didn't disappoint. It was our first time eating at Fired Pie and didn't know what the menu had to offer and that's when we was greeted by the manager Alfred. He told us all about the menu and the place and made us feel very welcome and at home. He gave us recommendations and was spot on with them. The pizza was amazing and one of the best I've ever had! While eating Alfred sat down next to us and asked us how everything was and had a friendly conversation about the pizza and company and felt very welcome and inviting. Alfred and his store are very top notch in my book and will definitely continue to more fantastic pizzas from them in the future!"}
{"text":"As good as all the other locations, service is pretty slow and the employees can appear a bit distracted at times. Hopefully it will survive, every other pizza restaurant fizzled in this locatio ."}
{"text":"Yummy! It is really good pizza. On the more pricey side. I am surprised to say that the gluten pizza was the best. It is more doughy. One let down was the 'bazooki'. It was very, very small and undercooked while being burnt on the bottom. Skip the dessert and just get a pizza! - you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Ordering here is pretty much the same as Chipotle or Subway. It was good I had a friend with me or I would've been totally overwhelmed with choices! XD She's gluten free, so it was cool to find a hangout spot we could both enjoy.   I got a pepperoni pizza and a pookie (a cookie served with ice cream, which is FREE when you check in on yelp ). Neither of them were incredibly exceptional, but they were still good! Service was awesome, environment is really cool and casual."}
{"text":"I would like to let everyone one know of 2 experiences I had at this location. The first one was on Thursday May 5th just before they were closing so I placed my 2 pizzas to go. When I got home the bottom of both pizzas were burnt. I tried calling but as I said they were getting ready to close before I even ordered.. how ever all the staff  were very funny friendly and very helpful.. Well since they were closed I sent them a email.  I revived a reply from Fred and he expressed his deepest apology as well as send me out two complementary coupons replace the Pizza. Fred went out of his way to ensure that things were made right with me and I was happy.. This the most out standing customer service I have seen in a long time."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews about Fired Pie (this location in particular).  Well, maybe not mixed as more of \"meh\".  Pizza plays a big part in my gastrointestinal life and as such, can't be wasted on mediocre pie.  Nonetheless, I was not disappointed with the quality of my Fired Pie.  The crust is thin on the bottom, but firm enough structurally to provide heft with the toppings.  By the way, I had a basic pepperoni, mushroom and black olive.  The outer crust is light and airy, with air pockets making eating the crust a joy, not a chore.  While I won't say this is the best pizza I've ever had, it's definitely one I'll come back to.  Four out of five pepperonis."}
{"text":"First time here...really great place!  Simple concept, great flavor...and really reasonable price. If you like a thin, crispy crust...and having DIRECT input on toppings while they are making your za, then this is the place.   I was probably a bit boring...just got Canadian Bacon and pineapple, but very good.   Definitely will be back, and looking for other locations when I travel..."}
{"text":"Fast and plenty of Vegan options. The staff is very knowledgeable on what's in their sauces when I asked them about oregano, and other sensitive ingredients I avoid. A HUGE Thank You to the crew for caring."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I love to get it crispy and also double cut so the pieces are smaller so I get to eat at slower. LOL"}
{"text":"Went to Yorkshire store last week and it was great. Service with a smile. So excited took a lunch date to Scottsdale and Greenway store. Pizza maker made no eye contact, mumbled, dirty shirt and hat on sideways. Couldn't have moved any slower. Cashier handled money then cups and pizza without washing hands or wearing gloves. Burnt edges of both pizzas. Theme is great. But Zocallo Plaza is a big disappointment. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this over other pizza places now just because I can make it how I want from severalllllll options. Great price $7.95 for personal and it could even be split between two or taken as leftovers....unless you are just plain hungry and want it all!!"}
{"text":"Great idea and well executed. Make your own custom pizza. Great choice of toppings & delicious product. Will be back !!"}
{"text":"Amazingly amazing inexpensive pizza. The crust is very thin and crispy which I love.  Came with my wife and since friends.  We all had custom pizzas which were cooked in about 5 minutes. Some of us had salad which was also custom and made to order. Everything was fantastic. Can't wait to come back. Oh and the Orchid is also amazing.  8 bucks max. Cheese pie I 6!"}
{"text":"No complaints. The service was perfect. Two college kids with great attitudes and friendly service. They walked us through how it worked and even cleaned off our area while we sat and talked.  The decor was modern and very hip. Not a huge fan of the graffiti but it gives it individual sense of style. The pizza place really stands out I comparison to any resteraunt I've been to due to it's system and decorum.  Lots of toppings and because they have such a hot fiery oven it can heat up numerous toppings .  Items looked fresh and up to code no wilted veggies and the spinach is put into olive oil?   Also had a steak and blue salad. Just right amount of balsamic and cheese. Great portions for 20 dollars I was so full and ready for a nap.   First place I've been to in Scottsdale that really impressed me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been regulars here for a couple years- we LOVE the pizza! Everything they make here is delicious for a good price. The customer service has slowly been going downhill however. We joke about how it's either going to be amazing customer service or absolutely terrible/almost comical. Recently it seems to just be the latter. The employees seemed to be stressed and rushed, in such a hurry they put my pizza in the oven without asking me if I wanted any toppings! It's been getting dirtier in the dining area, tables falling apart, old food and crumbs everywhere. I hope the management notices these things because it's definitely changed from what it was a year ago. I would hate to have to stop coming to this location because like I said, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent date night spot! They are still a very busy pizza joint. Still very affordable! I love eating their pizzas with bbq sauce. We just keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This has become our family goto spot for a a quick casual dinner. Kids love designing their own pizzas.  The salads are good.   It's quick, reasonably priced and feels fresh. It has quickly become a family favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the concept, really LOVE the simplicity, and am comfortable with the price.  Give it a try.  If you like thin pizza - you'll love this crust!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza place in Phoenix (even better than NYPD). The personal pan is just the right size for me! I get the the two different sausages with extra cheese and garlic sauce (rather than tomato), always knocks me out!"}
{"text":"Yum-o.  We loved the create your own concept for both salad and pizza.  This location isn't as clean and feels a little cavelike.  But the food and service were both great."}
{"text":"This place was a convenient place to eat after shopping all day. The pizza is made to your liking. I started off with a salad which was big enough to share with a friend. Pizza was amazing, thin crust and cheese is all I need. I will return!"}
{"text":"This rating is specifically for the attitude in this place. I have had Fired Pie Pizza at other locations and really like it. I walked in today with my kids to enjoy a lunch with them. My child has food allergies and this place was not at all accommodating. It is fine with me and my child, as not everyone can accommodate and is not expected to do so. However, the folks including the owner have a very nasty attitude towards this type of accommodation. 3 people including the owner had expressions of insensitivity towards my child. The order was going to be worked on but they realized that they would have to even get a fresh laddle for the sauce. Thats when it went south from here. Well, it was never any better from the beginning anyways as even changing gloves was a problem with the first employee. When I approached  the owner, his insensitive attitude was reflected even by saying, \"it is lunch time and we are way too busy to worry about this.\" My point to him is, it is perfectly fine to not be able to accommodate,  but it is not ok to have insensitive and disrespectful expressions towards a child who suffers from this allergy. Oh well. There is no reason for me to post a review if any place cannot work with allergies, but this location's insentivity deserves this rating and review."}
{"text":"This is the Chipotle of pizza spots.  Same basic concept, but switch out tortillas for pizza dough, and add an oven baking as the last step.  The pizza is good: thin crust, wide variety of toppings, with a selection of house variations.  It's super quick, relatively inexpensive and good.  The pizza is much better than any other corporate/delivery houses.  It's definitely an option for me during lunch or when I'm in a hurry and hankering a pie."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and open setting, and great food. I highly recommend ordering your food in person so you can watch them build your pizza. When I order over the phone and then pick up pizza for carryout or have it delivered, depending on who actually makes my pizza, it just turns out ok. When you go there in person and watch them make it, you'll get a perfect pizza pie built to your specifications every time."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place around. Fair priced, pizza made exactly as you want it, with a grand selection of toppings. They're the best."}
{"text":"What took me so long to find this place?  Salads and pizza both fantastic and fast.  This is the Chipotle of Italian food."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of MOD.  I left disappointed.  Not nearly the options for toppings.  The food didnt feel fresh and the crust was disappointing.  It was like a bad imitation of MOD.  Additionally the line was out the door and took almost 25 minutes to order.  Hardly fast pizza."}
{"text":"So I got here around 1pm and this place was dead.  Order a margarita pizza with a salad and drink. Everything came out to about $14.  I could see this place taking a while if it gets packed and everyone seems a little unorganized.  They have a cool soda machine that can add a couple of flavors to your drink. I would come back as I like thin crust."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place, tried it a few times but never go there. The pizzas are okay, but they don't serve wings. Also the salads are bland and not good at all. I go to Oregano's or zipps in this neighbourhood. I predict this place will close within the next year. There are too many fantastic places serving similar but better food close by. Can't make it in Arizona with below average food."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, cracker crust, you pick toppings, made fast, tastes great! Also, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"great pizza, love it, both locations here are both high level of food and atmoshere"}
{"text":"This pizza chain has a limited salad & pizza menu. The crust is very thin. I ate the pesto, cheese, tomato chicken item. The flavor was good but there was very little chicken. Companions shared the Italian meat pizza; it was covered with meat.  The salads are large.  The set combo pies are 11 inch at $7.95."}
{"text":"Another Yelp recommendation that was right on. Excellent pizza and Salad So Fresh. I had meaty Italian pizza. Quick more than enough for one. Salad split was enough.  Staff friendly. Very quick. Excellent for lunch. I loved Germoldies pizza But But Fried Pie is faster and a LOT Cheaper. That's why 5 Star  Next time- Yes next time I will never make my own pizza now that I understand. Ingredients are all so fresh place is very clean. Free refills on drinks. Great Fast Cheap Pizza and Salad."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you definitely need to try it. Everything is so good. And fresh. Employees are always friendly and service is fast."}
{"text":"Love the fact that this place is within walking distance of my house! Not a huge pizza fan, but their gourmet pizzas are amazing! Their steak and blue cheese is delicious, I would definitely recommend to others! The only thing I would change is the pizza size, their 11\" pizza is more of a personal pan since the crust is fairly thin, it would be cool if they offered in larger sizes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Being from Chicago I am a huge pizza fan. I was tired of the same old take out that I've grown used to since moving to the area so I did a search for something better and found this place. You get to make your own pizza for one price $8 ish. I'm a pretty basic eater, just cheese, and mushroom but still I really enjoyed my pizza, the atmosphere, and my overall experience. Ingredients were fresh, wait time wasn't long at all, the variety is amazing and the staff is friendly. I just wish they would open one up in Tempe."}
{"text":"Love the pie, the crust reminds me very strongly of Na'an, sauce is good and toppings are fresh. Had the Meaty Italian with spy sausage. Was shocked to like it as this is a corporate restaurant.  Also had the Black and Bleu salad. Big disappointment. The steak was sliced thin like a Philly cheese steak and was just short of disgusting. Texture was wrong, acids were wrong, just a missed mark in every regard.  Staff was pleasant, shop was clean and well appointed."}
{"text":"Yum!  Quick and fresh!  I love making up my very own pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great service great prices. Would recommend to anyone wanting excellent pizza quickly. Try the buffalo bleu, your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Awesome value here. It's Chipotle, pizza style. Ingredients are fresh and it's practically unlimited toppings. Enough said."}
{"text":"Was staying in a hotel nearby and was craving pizza. It was super close (about a 5 minute walk). It was a little tricky to find - down inside a little courtyard but worth the search.  You can choose your pizza toppings all for $7.95 per pizza. My hubby got one, I got one and our kids split one. They were even accommodating for putting certain toppings on only half for the kids.  They had juice boxes and milk for the kids and soda/iced tea for adults. My hubby and I tried both the mango and passion fruit iced teas. Both were yummy!  We didn't finish our whole pizzas, so we were able to bring them back to the hotel. Guess what's for lunch tomorrow?!"}
{"text":"I'm upping my rating on Fired Pie. The quantity of the ingredients has drastically improved since the first time that I have tried this place. But I have to admit my fired pies have come out much better of late. I hope these guys can keep up the good work.  I usually spend a skosh over $11 for a large soda and a pizza. It is kind of a fresh breath of air that you can put several different types of toppings on your pizza."}
{"text":"This is a fast casual dining kind of place set up like a Subway Sandwich Shop. You either order off a suggested menu or build your own salad and or pizza off the line. Any salad or pizza will only cost you $7.75 before tax drinks and tip.  I liked the salad much more than the pizza from here and would have given a low four stars just for the salad. We shared the steak and blue salad off the menu. The beef in the salad was like a lean medium rare kind of roast beef about a hundred times better than the beef like product you get from a Subway Chain place. The salad was very fresh but I thought the cold beef and cold caramelized onions were odd in this salad. I thought this salad lacked blue cheese BUT if I come back I can build it any way I want and will do better.  I didn't care for the pizza. Respectfully I wasn't a fan of the crust, sauce or the cheese. This crust was very thin and almost cracker like and wasn't like pizza crust to me. The sauce was seasoned very heavy with too much oregano and was overpowering as I wasn't able to taste the fresh basil on the pie.  (maybe an off batch?) The cheese is OK but it isn't the best.  I would come back and have a salad and if I tried a pie again I'd build it like an appetizer bread and enjoy it more.  Three stars is POSITIVE and honest.  These pizzas are fun but not up there with the best."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a fast/casual sort of build your own salad or pizza kind of place that also features a suggested menu in case you don't feel like making decisions.   I've been to another one of the eight Fired Pie locations and had the pizza before and do prefer the salads from Fired Pie over the pizzas but that is just my preference and not necessarily yours.  I picked the Field Greens with Roasted Vegetables Salad. I soon received a nice big fresh salad with lots of vegetables. I particularly liked the roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes in my salad, they were cold but still tasty.  My husband had the Steak and Blue Salad. He said it was pretty good but would have liked it better if they warmed up the meat in his salad. Oddly a meatball was found in his salad. Well I guess it was a free bonus like a prize in Cracker Jack because he ate it and we weren't charged extra for the cold meatball.  This place is brand new and the people working there have to read instructions on how to make the salads so bear with them.  At the time of this review 10-26-14 There is nothing better to eat at Tanger Outlets unless you want to eat the sandwiches next door from that popular chain that carries spongy chicken and soft fluffy fresh baked YOGA MAT bread.  So you have to grab your bite at Fired Pie.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I am vegetarian and this place  is good for veggie guys too. They will  make custom pizza as per your test. I like it."}
{"text":"I'm vegan so I ordered gluten crust for extra 2.00 and vegan cheese. Vegetable toppings. I was disappointed. I LOVE pizza so the fact that I left the last slice to be thrown away because I just couldn't bear it any more. Its hard to navigate a stroller. Hard to sit at table with baby in stroller. Nat very family friendly unless kids are older. I also thought I was going to \"Pizza Studio\" Found it the next night by the Palomar hotel. DEEEELISH!"}
{"text":"Been there several times and have really enjoyed their made to order salads and pizza. My husband loves it too. I love that the pizza comes out piping hot. Service is fast and very friendly and they have made some really good suggestions. Great thin crust pizzas."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! And reasonably priced.  I wish I had some pictures.  I will post them next trip but truly laid back atmosphere and amazing food"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Chipolte.... Good thing I love pizza more and at fired pie i get to choose all of toppings including cheese and sauce all for the same price.  Pizza was pretty big and very tasty.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our pizza's were fantastic . It hit our drunken stomachs in just right way. My pesto pizza and my friends Margherita pizza was amazing ."}
{"text":"Great pizza concept. Quality ingredients and you can choose whatever toppings you want and it's the same price just under $8. It's a 10 inch and just about right for one person. Nice staff and recommend this place. Is it the best pizza ever? No. But it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Wow!! Even worse the next time. This place literally lets the employees SLEEP in the restaurant lying down next to customers! It's as if the homeless are here. I even saw manager walk past him without telling him to get up."}
{"text":"The pizza is bomb! Fresh ingredients everything's made to order. The staff are quick and friendly. I crave this place all the time now. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in the customer service here specifically from the Manager (or one of the Managers). I work in the center and go in a lot, and I wanted to just get the small salad to go as I was working and would not be able to finish a large salad. I asked one of the gentleman who was making the salad and he said it should be fine if I just paid to add chicken since the small salad does not come with a meat. When he asked the Manager how to ring it she stated that \"we cannot do that.\" I said I didn't mind paying for it or how much it would be and she again just stated she could not do that for me then walked away. It was so awkward as both of the gentlemen there could obviously tell the Manager was NOT giving me any type of customer service. I am also shocked that a company would not take my money (I had stated I didn't care how much it was) or even offer me any ulterior options for next time. Being in the customer service industry for a long time I am truly amazed that you would potentially risk loosing a lot of business by treating a customer that way, especially one that works close by and helps bring in a lot of business. The Manager (a woman) was just plain rude and did not want to help me in the slightest. Such a shame, the food is great."}
{"text":"Fast service, great pizza. Can't complain. Got the Steak and Blue Pizza and really enjoyed it. From entering to leaving, probably was here for 30 minutes and I was dining in! I would probably eat here again. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Usually my favorite spot to go to but fat dude at Riverview couldn't follow simple instructions of putting on a light amount of cheese on my pizza because it's create your own after all right? But either dude the guy messed up twice and the 2nd time I just basically said screw it I'll deal with it pizza comes out and it's soft as feathers no crisp smh won't come here again!"}
{"text":"I went there at 6 o'clock on Monday may 22 and wow that young man working the oven needs a new position never have been served such an undone pizza! Fired pie is usually my go to spot but not this location or atleast not when the guy that was working the oven is working the oven! Very disappointed in my decision of coming here!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and this is a favorite place to get lunch! The people who work there are always friendly. The food is always amazing. I love their pizza! They are, of course wood fired, as the name suggests, so the crust is delicious. I've done pesto and red sauce as a base and then I load my pie up with all of my favorite toppings. Chicken, meatball, fresh mozzarella, artichokes, Sun dried tomatoes, peppers, kalamata olives, fresh garlic.... I could go on and on. Their salads are also wonderful! There is a choice of romaine, spring mix, iceberg and other lettuce which is nice, add your favorite toppings and they will toss the dressing on it for you if you want. The chipotle ranch is my favorite. I love the salads as much as the pizza! This place is great, only thing is that it gets VERY busy during lunch time. I always show up around 11 to avoid a long line. Problem solved!"}
{"text":"Disappointed the manager/owner? told me that they only put a little cheese on their pizzas. Wth? Is it my pizza or his? The menu says create what you want. The workers even gave him a weird look when I asked for a little more cheese on top.   Luckily, one server handled it when he walked away.   Probably won't come back to this location. Disappointed.   The staff was friendly, but the manager/owner? was too stingy and seemed to make the staff nervous, frustrated, and embarrassed with him undermining their job. Especially when the board says anything you want on it."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!! Perfect for my husband and I since he likes toppings that I don't care for and visa versa.  One price for an 11\" pizza pie.  Gluten free for only $2 more. The pie is thin crusted. You chose all the toppings your heart desires. Several sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies to choose from. The Pie is prepared right in front of you and put into a wood fired oven. Choices of fresh basil, oregano and another herb, as well, to be put in top... once the pie comes out of the oven.   You can also create your own salad.   Drinks: They have a selection of beers (Kilt lifter, Blue Moon, Budweiser, etc), sodas, teas (black tea, jasmine, and another tropical infusion), lemonade, and water.   The Dessert cookie is a \"Must try\"...it is served warm with a scoop of ice cream ($3). Perfect finishing touch...smiles on all our faces.   Our family enjoyed the whole experience. This is a Pizza Lovers Heaven-- \"Must Try!\""}
{"text":"Build your own pizza?  Yeah, I'm in!  It's pretty simple.  You choose whatever toppings you want and they fired it up.  It takes a whole ten minutes for you to get a fresh hot pizza.  Delicious!  You can order salads as well!"}
{"text":"Better than the other 'build your own pizza' places that are popping up around town. Good crust, flavorful pizza and salads. This place is great and the people working there are friendly!"}
{"text":"Pizza and salads are pretty good. Reason I gave them 2 stars is because the manager/owner is very condescending and rude.  I could write a lengthy review but I feel like nobody would read it. First went when they first opened and went a few times after because it's right by my work and I was excited that we got a restaurant in AZ that is similar to Pieology.   I could go on about the manager/owner but the thing that irked me the most was when I was listing the veggies I wanted on my pizza, I got to about 7 toppings, and he goes \"Whoa the limit is 5\". I quickly apologized and in a very condescending way he says, \"Uhh I'll let it slide this time.\" I thanked him but while still in line I also saw him picking toppings off another customer's pizza and angrily tossing them out because apparently they picked too many toppings too. Shortly after I realized he wasn't doing me a favor. He micro manages like crazy, you can tell he's all about cost management first and hospitality second. The funny thing is nowhere in the RESTAURANT OR MENU does it say 5 TOPPING LIMIT.  I hope the management changes or the guy comes to his senses that he's making his employees and customers uncomfortable because frankly the food is more than decent and not super expensive and more importantly it's right by my office. This guy hasn't just turned me off from the restaurant but a handful of my co-workers as well."}
{"text":"This place was close to where we were staying and was delicious!!! The price is right and quality was outstanding. The staff was wonderful and very helpful (this was our first visit). I wish I had the names of the people who helped us but sadly I don't....they were fantastic! We visited around 4 on 3/24/16."}
{"text":"Pizza has been great here when I have gone in to order and eat at the restaurant , so today I tried to place my order online for take out. I Received an email message that my order was being processed and to keep my phone close because they would let me know when the pizza was ready. After 30 mins and no message I called the store. The lady who answered told me my pizza had been ready for 30 mins, but there was no driver to deliver. I said I asked for take out and expected a message when the pizza was ready. I was going to be picking it up. She was like oh yea, that is what your order says. I am very disappointed. My son left to get the cold pizza , he just arrived home to tell me they charged him for the pizza at the store, even though I paid for it through their app using my PayPal acct. OMG can they do anything right?? Now I have been on the phone with Emily for 10 minutes trying to get my credit card refunded. I will NEVER order online with this location again. What an awful experiences. Update: Within 10 mins of my post the manager Fred reached out to me. He helped me understand that Grubhub is a third party vendor for ordering through Yelp. And it's not Fire Pie fault the system is broken. I appreciate Fred reaching out to make sure my issues were resolved and helped me understand that Fire pie at this location doesn't have online ordering directly. I have added a star because Fred took the time to check in and make things better.. I will continue to eat here, I will just go into the store to place my order :-)"}
{"text":"A build your own pizza place with many different options. It can get a little busy at lunch during the week so you might want to try to go a little early or be prepared for the longer line out the door. The staff is really friendly; a good mix of being polite but also moving the line along  I recommend the margarita pizza with regular crust but my lunch buddy says the gluten free crust is pretty good (and not just \"pretty good for gluten free;\" just good - period).  The restaurant can get a little loud and might be a little tough for large lunch groups. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Pizza made fresh to order in front of your eyes? Yes please!  Fired Pie is great, and the personal pizzas are a larger size so they are shareable. Plus, who doesn't like a Chipotle-style ordering process where you choose exactly what you want?  I always get the chicken pesto pizza, but they have just about anything you can think of.  This place gets busy during lunch, so give yourself ample time if you're headed back to the office!"}
{"text":"ok. now i am not sure how helpful i am being and i am not a complainer.  BUT...  if someone says: no cheese or meat on their pizza, please please PLEASE change your gloves.  also, if you hate your job, please quit now.  food service jobs are about customer service.    otherwise.  if you like pizza and you like cheese and meat, THIS is the place to be!!!  amazing."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of fired pie the chipotle meets pizza concept works for me. I love to load my pizza up with toppings but always hate how expensive it gets at the typical pizza places. Here i can load up a pizza with what ever creative combo I want and it's all the same price that is actually really cheap for a made to order personal pizza.  One of the things I like is that they have a ton of choices for meats including stuff like capicola, 2 kinds of sausage, and meatball that most places don't carry. They also have a good arrangement of veggies and toppings that all seem fresh.  This spot is also close to Mill so it makes for a good food option before seeing a movie or hitting the bars without having to deal with the typical Mill pricing."}
{"text":"Love all the options and being able to see them make your pizza in front of you so you can ask for more toppings. They have so many options and different variety of cheese. Best pizza for a quick lunch subway style of ordering. I had really great service especially the first time I ordered the people were very helpful."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great prices, great for kids and very filling and delicious!  My only suggestion would be to expand their beer selection, but it's a great place to dine in and take out!  Very reasonably priced as well!"}
{"text":"Good service and pizza. The Hawaiian BBQ pizza was tangy, sweet, and spicy all in one bite. I added jalapeños but add with caution as it does have a kick."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went with a group, some of us were first timers. Can't say enough about the pleasure of choosing the crust, sauce and ingredients to build your own masterpiece. There are also pizzas to choose from on their menu if you don't want to build your own. I chose the gluten-free herbed crust, not because I needed to, just wanted to. It was great! Mine had pesto sauce, chicken, artichokes, red onions, mozzarella, parmesan, not traditional, but DE-licious! These are individual 11\" pizzas for only $7.95 each. The line was to the door, and stayed that way for the 2 hours we were there. They move the line along and turn out the pizzas quickly. My hard-to-please husband is still raving about it, so we'll be back very soon! This is a must-try!  They do have salads, too, by the way, but didn't try one.  Too full of pizza!"}
{"text":"This location used to be owned by a mom and pop from Brooklyn and they made the best pizza. Too bad most Phoenicians do not know what good pizza is! The interior is interesting, a little fake NY if you ask me. However the pizza is good. Nice thin crust, fresh motz ( you have to ask for it)  and fresh ingredients. Upon entering you are greeted by large menu signs. It felt somewhat like a subway restaurant in that you walk down the line, following your pizza with employees asking what you would like to add to your pizza. The employee looked at me strangely when I asked for olive oil instead of sauce and then proceeded to put butter on the crust. I had to correct the employee, butter is WAY different than olive oil! No biggie. I had them add fresh mozzarella, fresh spinach, sautéed mushrooms and capacola. Wow! I'm from Jersey and my dad threw pies for all of this life and this was GOOD! Almost as good as my dad used to make. A definite place to return!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I must go there three times per week. Luigi and his crew really take care of me. When it comes to pizza and salad there is no place I'd rather go.  Kevin Porreco"}
{"text":"The staff was excellent! My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the meat selection looks a little shabby, could be fresher."}
{"text":"Fired Pie locations seem to be popping up all over the place!  It was just a matter of time before one would appear in the University area.  Like other locations, this one offers a fast casual ambience, friendly service and a clean environment.  There are a handful of suggested toppings, but plenty to build your own.  How can you go wrong when it's exactly what you like?  They are only lacking free wifi.  Nevertheless, as Arnold said, \"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"Made your way! Make the perfect \"PIE\"! Any place where you can get garlic infused pizza I'm there!"}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite go-to's for pizza, Fired Pie offers great tasting pizza with endless variety. For only $8 each, everyone gets their own pizza with unlimited toppings, so don't hold back! Get whatever you want!  They do offer a gluten-free crust (for additional cost) but their regular crust is light and comes nice and crispy out of their pizza oven. They have a variety of sauces: I stick with the traditional tomato sauce, but my wife and daughter like to mix it up with olive oil and pesto. They have a number of different cheeses, a host of veggies, and a ton of proteins, including....ANCHOVIES! Yes, now I can finally have anchovies on a pizza without my family complaining. Fired Pie, Thank you!!  They are located in a busy strip mall, close to the movie theater, so parking can be tricky. They do have a cozy dining room, but we usually get our pies to go.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Our \"pizza and salad artist\" was a hoot!  Son enjoyed the quality and quantity of meat on his pizza.  The Italian salad is a winner.  I missed the YELP check-in for a pzookie....which means there will be a next time - would have been anyway :)"}
{"text":"Great prices.  Fresh food.  Terrific service.  It was my first trip in and out family loved it.   The salad was also amazing.  We will return. !!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great but it seems that there is usually a slightly elevated amount of chaos at this location. The staff is young and seems to not have any direction from management. I think an actual manager, not just someone who holds the title, needs to be present more often and provide guidance to the employees to help alleviate the chaos and streamline operations."}
{"text":"Very confusing trying to remember what you want on your pizza by the time you get to order it.  The ingredients should be viewed on big boards right in front when ordering besides on the wall in the waiting line. In the late afternoon customers were being blinded by the bright sun streaming into the restaurant.  Why no shades?  Poor planning!   Numbers should be given out when ordering instead of employees calling out names as they wander around with pizzas in hand.    The pizza's we ordered were delicious but the negatives will stick in our minds!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Pick what you want on your pizza and it's fire roasted in minutes.  No long wait times. Good salads too."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of these restaurants around the valley, and this location is disappointing.  The quality of customer service is lacking.  I still love the food, and love the variety of toppings.  I was also a bit disappointed to find out they no longer offer BBQ chicken though :(."}
{"text":"Great little place!  Custom salads and pizzas with gluten free options.  We had a pesto chicken pizza and buffalo chicken caesar.  Both were great!"}
{"text":"Def the perfect addition to tanger..we shopped n had our version of a perfect pizza..we always make a stop here...it was busy but they had plenty of employees wrking n we waited about 5 minutes for the pizza."}
{"text":"Decent enough pizza that gets good lunch play because of an attractive price point and quick service."}
{"text":"$8 for a made to order 11\" thin crust pizza? Yeah, I'll take that deal. The doughs great, the atmosphere is modern and relaxed, the ladies behind the counter are pretty, they have a million options, and considering they're cooking you a damned pizza, they're quick too. Get there early though, this place is popular and a line forms fast."}
{"text":"Good food and decent price. The reason for the three stars is because you shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes to get a pizza that supposedly takes five minutes in the oven. Online ordering would be a great addition to the store;it would save people a lot of time."}
{"text":"Love being able to design my pizza from scratch and not be charged extra. Plus the staff is always pleasant!"}
{"text":"After my bad experience the owner did personally message me And offer me free food which was nice of him. The only problem is I didn't not have a problem with the food. Offering me free food will not change the fact that he is rude to his guest and employees"}
{"text":"Me and my husband eat here at least once a week. This by far is my favorite place to eat pizza. I enjoy the fact that I can put everything on my pizza for $8. The crust is thin and crunchy and the meat toppings are top quality. I like the million different opinions there are for the perfect topped pizza. We saw the size of their salads and we were shocked at how big they were. This place is always busy which is great. That means they will be around for a long time. I HIGHLY recommend this place If you want the best cheap pizza ever."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Pizza   I went to Fired Pue for dinner last night with my sister and nephew. Fired Pie has a concept, which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.  Fired Pie, has an assembly line for Pizza or salad if you prefer.   Fired Pie offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables. You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.   As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.  The line wasn't very long, three others in front of us, but seemed to be moving extremely  slow in comparison to other Fired Pie locations I have visited. I understand it's a newly opened business, and there is always a learning curve with new employees.  I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.    It was somewhat challenging to find a clean table, even though  the restaurant had very few customers and most of the tables in the restaurant were empty, just not clean. Our pizza's came out within 15 minutes. I thought my pizza as well as my sister and nephews were slightly over done however we ate them.  Prices are modest, I will have to come back sometime in the future ang give Fired Pie another try."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, and it never disappoints, but this week our pizza was on point. Asked for my usual and fired up extra crispy, but no burnt edges please. The toppings were plentiful, and cheeses were delicious. Thanks to Luigi, Zac and Allison. Yes, we'll be back soon!"}

Prices are modest, I had a standard 11 inch pie and a fountain drink for about ten dollars.  The staff is friendly, accomadating,  the food is good, and at a reasonable price.

{"text":"Pretty good. Usually the pizza is good and crispy but occasionally the dough is a little under cooked. Somewhat inconsistent but always good. The quality seems to depend on how busy they are."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive at first... seriously though.  Pizza is an art.  Build your own pizza?  Are you sure??  Happy to have found this place.  The pizza was delicious.  Like... one of the best I've had in a while.  Maybe because I was able to get all of the toppings that I could ever want?  & super affordable.  Careful during lunch... it gets insanely packed & rightfully so.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"The best place for personal pizzas. This place can be kind of busy sometimes but the wait is well worth it.  Love me some gabbagool!"}
{"text":"This is the worst spot ever. The employees don't care about their job.. Worst service ever. huge rip off. Go to blaze, fired pie is a HUGE waste of time."}
{"text":"Why can't pizza joints offer pizza by the slice?  Who wants a whole pizza - even if it's not that big -  when they're eating by themselves?  This is a cool-looking place with a friendly staff, but in terms of pizza, aside from the \"no slices\" thing,  I think the crust is too thin (but then I prefer thick crust - the thicker the better).  Also, it seems  my request for \"extra pepperoni\" fell on deaf ears.   All in all though, the pizza tasted pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Food was prepared quickly and all ingredients used were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Pizza with tons of flavor, fresh ingredients, and topping options galore - quick and easy.   This is one of those make-your-own places with a layout like Subway of Chipotle, but with a much higher degree of quality and service. And the price is so reasonable! They don't charge per topping - get whatever you want for like $8."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, customized individual  pizza, I enthusiastically recommend Fired Pie. This location has been open for a couple of years now, and it's evident the current management team takes pride in its product. I find the pizzas very tasty and the small side salad is the perfect compliment. A bonus is Fired Pie participates in Rewards Dining with United, Southwest, Hilton, etc. By joining one of the dining rewards networks, you get miles/points when you use a registered payment card here."}
{"text":"The service is always really great at this location and you can't go wrong making your own food to order and watching them make it. As long as you have an idea of what would taste good, they'll make it. Just like Chipotle but it's your own personal pizza or salad. Next time I'm on a green kick, I'm going to try a salad. Strongly recommend the pesto sauce with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil for something light."}
{"text":"Each and every time I come to this place the service is stellar. The food is delicious. The staff is very friendly and they provide service with a smile, unlike many places. Prices are reasonable for quality ingredients. GREAT JOB FIRED PIE. Keep up the awesome job you do!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is a fast-food customized pizza joint.  Their \"pies\" are 11\", unlimited toppings, several different cheese choices, and numerous topping choices.  It cooks fast, too.  If you know what you're doing you can get through pretty quick, and it's done almost as fast. Do get the garlic oil.  Mine was basic.  A bit of extra sauce (I thought he didn't put enough initially), pepperoni, sausage, onion, bell peppers.  Very tasty.  I liked it.  Tasty. Hot and fresh. Fast.  Big enough I didn't finish mine.  Probably ideal for lunch. I like Grimaldi's better, and would favor Grimaldi's for dinner, but this is good.  I'm sure I will be back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Great food & fast service. You can't beat the prices either. Small space inside so it gets a little crowded during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Love the concept. You can get it your way! My wife and I split one and the halves were very different and they cooked it just the way we like it. Crispy! Great staff. Pizza came out super fast and tasted great. Also, very affordable."}
{"text":"This operation needs some big time tweaking, like STOP, evaluate, make changes. Ordering is weirdly stressful and inconsistent. There are no menu's in front to remind you of what you are ordering at the food line, with any line behind you you can't see menu boards. There is no identification of what ingredients you are looking at, no description by servers, what am I looking at? what are my choices? what do you recommend?.....silence. The servers don't know their role, I don't know their role, with people breathing down your neck good luck first timers, cause its crazy. Service should be 1. Greeter, welcome !, (orientation, have you been here before?)  Takes the order completely, describes cheeses, sauces,  toppings, each worker has a station they do not deviate from making certain each guest is good as they pass off. Cashier shouldn't be pizza cook, sell desserts, sell beverages, tell guests approximately how long order will take and their way of announcing your name (Use speaker, or take it out to guests) have someone checking each table and maintain dining room. I strongly recommend Pizza is instantly taken to table once its out of the oven.  So easy to take wrong food as a guest, food just sits until someone checks on their order and now is eating food right out of the oven that has cooled losing quality each second. The Pizza is good and could be amazing, there are so many choices in the shopping center if you do not make the experience equally amazing you will soon be losing traffic and sales.   There are also many of these make your own pizza concepts now. My opinion is re-training by owners is critical right now, we have been to location 4 times in the past few months at the same time and traffic looks softer each time. We are done now and will rest for awhile. Once we decide to go back, we hope owners have heeded this advice."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Fired Pie, we will definitely be back! We luckily didn't have to wait in any line but the line behind us moved quickly.   We had the Steak & Blue pizza (instead of making our own) and the Caesar salad. Sooo good! The garlic oil they put on the crust is probably my favorite part. Both were enough food for two people.  If I could make a suggestion it would be to have a stack of plates by the other utensils/take out boxes. We shared over the pizza tin but we ate so fast it didn't even matter. Service was great too.  Would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Fast!! Low cost!! Delicious!Good service!My favorite is margarita. Recommended to try it!"}
{"text":"I have to admit in general I tend to not love brick oven pizza. I like my pizza ny style. But this place is great.  Basically its subway but for pizza. Same processes. Thry make you a personal pizza as you watch. Pizza artists. Really good quality. They are always extremely n ice. The place is always clean. If you love pizza like me you have to try this place. The diet coke is great. But I also like the free brew green ice tea. I always ask the guy to not make my pizza crispy.  They smile and hook you up. Pizza how ever you want it."}
{"text":"I like restaurants where they tell you one thing during the order process but when it comes time to pay, they switch it up, so I love Fired Pie!  Just kidding. It's a missed opportunity for them to keep a customer by honoring what one employee told us. So, over $1.50, they lose a customer moving forward. Suffice to say, some of the employees need customer care training."}
{"text":"The pizza here is servicable.  It is not my favorite, but not bad for what is essentially fast food pizza.  There is a good variety of toppings, and the price is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We came after school for some food and they have GREAT pizza. It's customizable, like Subway for pizza, and 11\" pizza for $7.75. The quality is outstanding and I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for a good food experience. I will definitely be coming back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great pizza - exactly the way I want it.  Salads are great too!  I just wish it was closer to where we live :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I am a huge fan of brick oven pizza, and being able to customize my pizza. Everything seems really authentic and fresh. The crust has that nice crunch to it. The sauce has the perfect amount of seasoning and sweetness, not to over powering, and the mozzarella is amazing, really surprising for an establishment like this. The price is pretty great as well, a customized pizza with what ever you want for $7.99, can't beat that."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple fired pies.  This one and 24th st and baseline are the two worst.  When the pizza is made and cooked correctly their pizza is great.  The problem is this location always has new employees.  Whenever one of the new employees makes my pizza it comes out sub par.  If too much cheese is used the bottom of the dough gets undercooked and is soggy.  The newer employees put way too much cheese on and they dont turn the pizza enough and what ends up happening is the outside is burnt while the bottom of the dough is soggy and undercooked.  You could come in one day and get a great pizza, you come in tommorow and the pizza is terrible.  It all depends on who makes the pizza.  The best location is 101 and i 17, that location is more consistent."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the pizza since I just had a salad, but my first experience with Fired Pie was great!!  I chose to get my own salad creation (made to order) and everything was fresh and very tasty!!  Service was quick and the person helping me offered me suggestions since I said I was a newbie.  I just wanted an iced tea and was only expecting the usual Nestea that most places have in their soda dispensers.  Wow!  I was surprised to see that they had 4 or 5 different iced tea flavors by my favorite, China Mist.  I had a glass of Blackberry Green Tea and a Watermelon one that was incredible!  Overall, I have to say Fired Pie did not disappoint!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle meets pizza, this place was delicious!   Oh and their southwest salad was amazing  We will DEFINITELY eat here again.   Ps, did I mention the great customer service?   5 stars all around. Excuse me while I put on some elastic waist pants and head back for round two..."}
{"text":"Fire up the oven because Fired Pie just opened a new location in Mesa yesterday. The line was crazy long so I decided to stop by on their second day open. Taking over a spot left vacant by another build-your-own pizza places, you'll find that the interior is pretty similar to the place that was there before. On this first visit, we tried 3 of the pizza creations to-go: margherita, Hawaiian BBQ, and Steak & Blue. All 3 were great and we have no complaints. You can also build-your-own pizza or modify a creation to your how every you desire. In our case, that meant heavy on the garlic! Service was friendly and pretty fast. We're excited to go back for future visits to this local, fast casual pizza experience!"}
{"text":"Great pizza been here before but decided to come into today 3/14/2018 for national pie day and also for a discount,ordered my pizza with alot of toppings come to find out the discount is only on one topping.So I ask the girl she said yes only one topping oh well,came through a second time ordered a pizza with one topping for my grandaughter the girl working the register says the discount dosent start until 2pm are u kidding me it's national pie day all day not at 2pm,I still got the pizza for my grandaughter."}
{"text":"Literally just watched the cook lick his fingers in the back before touching my pizza. Demanded full refund from the manager who was running her hands through her greasy hair while telling me I couldn't get my money back. Yuck. Don't eat here unless you want to be eating someone else's sweat or saliva."}
{"text":"I love this place but that is probably because I select awesome combinations for my pizza... : P Went here for lunch yesterday an as always it was really good. I recently went to the one in Central Ave too, and it seems they have a nicer pace at that one, seemed more coordinated when they make your items...  Oh well, maybe it was just a frantic day... lunch rush hour gets kind of tough... long lines and super busy, but they are very fast. And also, this place is kind of loud... super loud... but everybody is very friendly and I could go here for the teas alone. Delicious. Overall great experience and I will go again tomorrow if I can..."}
{"text":"Well, I came to this place for lunch since I was attending training in this center. I think they have a good thing going on with this concept. I love the pizza because I can choose whatever ingredients I like. Service is friendly and well paced. They get rush hour like at noon and they get huge lines all the way to the door, however, no worries, they are very fast and you will get your pizza in no time.  My pizza was a little burnt at a couple of spots on top, but nothing major. Overall really good.  Oh, and I love the teas, they black, green and jasmine, passion fruit, and a watermelon option, they are so yummy you don't even need to put sugar on them."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad that I've barely tried this place.  I've been missing out!  I love the convenience of building your pizza as you move through the line.  Salads as well, I've tried the Buffalo Chicken Cesar Salad and I'm in love!  Great thing about it is that's it's not pricey at all!  I don't think I have any cons for this location cause we've always had wonderful to staff help us.  Everyone is friendly and always smiling making the environment so comfortable.  I love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  What a great concept! I love that I can add whatever toppings I want to my pizza.  In addition to the quality food, the employees are SO nice.  The pizza is ready in no time too! I really enjoy coming here, and I will continue.  Thank You!"}
{"text":"This lil gem is somewhat hidden, but so worth the visit.  This is a subway meets pizza shop.  They offer salads but we opted for pizza.  They even offer gluten free crusts.   I chose the original crust with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, fontina cheeses, kalamata olives, spinach, sin dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, sautéed onions, and mushrooms.    Delicious and so many combination possibilities.  It was delivered fresh and hot in just 5 minutes"}
{"text":"Cowabunga dudes! If you're a pizza lover like myself then you are going to enjoy this place. Fired pie is simple and delish! Create your own pizza or salad. Wine and beer available. The cookie with ice cream top off this experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"Being my husband only likes thin crust pizza. This worked out for him. Great service and delicious pizza and salad. We will be back."}
{"text":"They make 11\" personal size pizzas for $7.95 with no limit on the toppings you put on it.  The pizzas are ready in about 5 minutes.  I happen to like thin crust pizzas and my pizza was great.  The staff was very friendly as well.  They also do personalized salads, but I didn't try that."}
{"text":"Elias - absolutely phenomenal and kind guy!!! I showed 6min to close (not on purpose swear and literally saw it closing and he took my order anyways!!) he was more than polite and happy to help feed me after an exhausting day of a 14hour shift!!! I left a $10 tip in the jar and still didn't feel like it was enough!  Give him something please!! He's a true leader!!"}
{"text":"Love creating my own pizza here! Always great pizzas. The salads look good but have not tried them.  Great service. Later at night it's nor as crowded but during rush it can be difficult to get seats.  Love their fired pookie! yum! My favorite pizza is the pesto chicken with caramelized onions instead of red onions and add roasted peppers!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is SO good!  The pizzas are delicious but kinda small so we order 2 for our family.  The salads are great too!  The price is very good.  The booths are a little small to sit in but they do have tables and chairs.  Love this place.  Wish they were closer to home!"}
{"text":"Big improvements lately! As a regular customer, I see the same fast service, but all kinds of little things that add up to a much better experience. The whole set-up of the place is more attractive and convenient, from the happy and friendly staff to the furniture arrangements. There is a lot of attention to details that makes this place more like an intimate café and less like a fast-food joint. Congratulations and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The idea of a fast casual pizza joint is definitely intriguing, and I was grateful to be invited to dinner at Fired Pie in Scottsdale last week to check out the concept myself. There are 10 Fired Pie locations in the Valley, and I visited the Northsight Boulevard location.   Walk in, and you'll see a list of ingredients, including sauce type, cheese, toppings and seasonings. I've never had alfredo or pesto sauce pizzas, but you can get those here, as well as buffalo and barbecue sauces, which I thought was unique.  Cheese include everything from feta to gorgonzola, and a variety of meats, veggies and fresh herbs are available for toppings on the gluten-free dough. The 11-inch pizza ($7.95) is ready in about five minutes, and it's nice beer and wine are available as drink choices.  If you're not into carbs, load up on a salad instead. One of my favorite parts of the meal was the $3 \"pookie,\" a baked cookie pie topped with vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely perfect to share and mighty tasty.  I liked my fresh mozzarella, kalamata olive, artichoke and tomato sauce pizza (my friend got sausage, spinach and artichoke with alfredo -- she loved it), and it was really filling for one person - I ate all of mine because I was starving but would normally take a couple slices home. The only thing I'd try next time is asking for it a little less crispy -- I'm a doughy pizza lover.  I loved the patio seating options, and the atmosphere was relaxed, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Came with 5 kids and no fighting over what kind of pizza to get. Everyone got to pick their own pie, I got a to try them all and they were all awesome. I had the Steak and Blue salad and it was huge.  Although I wasn't too thrilled with the balsamic dressing the salad ingredients were really good. Next time I would just get the dressing on the side.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have tried several of these \"build your own\" style pizza..but couple things we love about this one!  The garlic and oil sauce is delicious & combine that with the pesto=YUM!  They also don't skimp on the cheese. .if you want all of,  it bring it on!  Then,  the meat choices,  crumbled bacon, Canadian bacon grilled chicken,  buffalo chicken AND Bbq chicken and tons more like meatballs, salami & cappicola.  Then the veggies, the grilled onions,  garlic, spinach & plenty others of course!   The only thing that I believe could improve is to have the glass shield \"labeled\" with the corresponding ingredients..would help speed the selection process.    The crust came out perfectly,  bubbled and toasty combined with yummy ingredients so satisfying!  Staff very friendly & helpful, decent parking, delicious ingredients. . .we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very very very good pizza.  I picked what I wanted on it, they slapped it on there and tossed it into the oven, all in front of me.  5-10 mins later it's in my hand, then chronologically in my mouth and stomach. I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent custom fired personal pizzas!  What more could you ask for?  The service is great, and quick also.  They have everything out in a subway-esque line up and plop it into the dough then toss it into the fire pizza oven.  Only takes a few minutes and it's in your hands to do with as you please."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but the radio is far too loud for its quality.  I can hear the speaker rattling and it's way too tinny with treble.  Not to mention I had to ask the waitress to repeat herself almost every time. Because the radio blended her out."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good service.  It is a great concept in which you construct your own pizza from a great selection of toppings and almost before you can sit down, your pizza is ready."}
{"text":"Staff always friendly and food alway great! I always build with chicken and artichoke"}
{"text":"Great pizza at great prices. Their crust is delicious. Usually I call in my order so I don't have to wait in line. The lines can be long around lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great price and you can add as much as you like!  It's always cooked perfectly and the employees are super friendly.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Guy cooking the  pizzas wasn't required to wear gloves,he was picking at his eyes, rubbing his beard and arms, I complained,they asked him to go wash and stop doing that,but argued that he didn't actually touch the pizzas. I waited in a long line and noticed he touched each pizza, then a phone call to the business and he burnt about 11 pizzas four of them were mine, they offered to cut off the burnt crust, omg. So when I got home with these pizzas my family called to complain and they said they canceled the transaction and I wouldn't see the debit on my account, but sure enough it's there. Would love to hear from the owners how they can spin this I have been there other times and the pizza was good, but they claim they can't hear you over the divider so the pizzas don't get home with toppings I request."}
{"text":"The best fired pie location to come to. I love this place. Fixings are just right and perfect. The manager Anna was friendly and so was the staff. I highly recommend trying this location."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank the co-founder for fixing the issues, so I'm updating the review to five stars."}
{"text":"Their warm cookies are delicious too.  Vegetarian options:  black olive, candied walnut, craisin, garlic croutons, garlic, granny smith apple, green pepper,  jalapeño, kalamata olive, pepperoncini, pineapple, red grape, red onion, roasted mushroom, roasted artichoke, roasted peppers, roasted spinach, roasted white onion, sun dried tomato, tortilla strips, tomato"}
{"text":"Pizza was fine. I had really high expectations because I'm looking for a fast food pizza restaurant in Phoenix similar to punch pizza in Minnesota, but I haven't found anything as good yet. This is close because they cool pizzas in like 2 min in a hot hot oven, but the quality of the ingredients were so so (reminded me of subway). It was good, just didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Have gone a few more times now.  I am so hooked on the Pesto Chicken Pizza! I always add on add'l toppings which is surprisingly NO extra cost! Most pizza places would charge you for each add'l topping...NOT here! So I usually add on artichoke hearts, feta cheese, roasted peppers, spinach & garlic!  How can you beat that! I usually go after the big lunch rush, usually like 4 pm, otherwise expect to wait in line at the peak of the lunch rush during the week, but the line does go pretty fast. I like that they are even open til 8 pm, M-F, and even til 4 pm Sat & Sun!.... In a way, it's kind of their advantage to stay open later like that, as people get off work in the nearby area & they can swing in their to get a pizza or salad!  On the counter, they have parm cheese, & red pepper flakes to sprinkle on your pizza, but they also have garlic powder, & Italian Seasonings, too!    Before this place opened, I would usually go to the nearby Z-Pizza on Thomas, but no more!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away by this place. Low expectations going in, but once I took my first bit I realized whoever thought of this is going to be filthy rich.  Can't complain about the price, it's basically Subway/Chipotle but it deals with Pizza.  I immediately texted a few friends, they've all been since and agree, this place is money!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews here on Yelp, we decided to try Fired Pie for dinner.  They definitely didn't disappoint. Our family all did the build-your-own option. The size was plentiful as we all had left overs (which we plan to heat up for lunch tomorrow).  A pizza and drink was about $10, but considering that we will get two meals out of it, it's a great value to us.  It was walking distance from our hotel (Hilton Suites) so we didn't have to deal with parking. But we saw plenty of parking on a Sunday night. It's a bit tricky to find as they are kind of tucked away behind The Good Egg and Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Love this place! You walk in and see huge menus of recommended pizza combos, but you can build your own--hence the motto: We build; You INSPIRE.  Like others have mentioned, it's like a subway-set up where you tell them if you're doing pizza  or salad. Next is choice of sauce (pesto / alfredo / marinara / bbq / buffalo? / garlic butter). You move to the cheese stations where you can choose from a wide variety of cheeses (most common is shredded mozzarella). Then you have meats and veggies.  My fave combo? alfredo base with mozzarella + feta + grilled chicken + spinach + carmelized white onions + artichokes + mushrooms + cranberries.  Don't forget to ask for a fired pookie too (think small chocolate chip cookie that's not quite cooked all the way served with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream).  You can order for in-house or to go, but don't call ahead. They make to order when you show up.  Busy area, so parking can be a challenge. There's adequate seating inside but noisy during high peak times. There's only a couple of tables outdoors with umbrellas.  Great food. Decent staff. Great selection. Remember -- they build -- you INSPIRE! :)"}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza I've had! They also take precautions for those with Celiac or intolerance. My whole family loved the options and flavor. It was perfect for a quick bite on the go."}
{"text":"Wow amazing all the topping you want for $7.75! What a great place. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted the product but don't know if I would ever go back there. There were 5-6 employees working. There was one customer with 2 kids eating in the restaurant, one customer picked a pizza up and us, waiting for our pizza.  Most of the tables were dirty. There was water on the floor. One girl was bouncing a tennis ball behind the counter. Another girl, who put the toppings on our pizza was playing with her hair and browsing on her phone right by the food.  It took two employees to box our 2 pizzas. For how busy they were there were too many employees. The owner of this store must not care about his franchise! Dirty dirty dirty!!! I'll try a different pizza establishment next time. First time there and last time there"}
{"text":"This place offered special price on a pizza pie on national pi day! It was very awesome sounding but the pies themselves seemed small and not much topping. Of course they looked great on the Fox News broadcast, Great marketing on the news to draw business. I guess toppings are expensive after all."}
{"text":"Best single serve pizza place their is. A lot of company's have opened up places like this in Arizona, but this is the best one that exists."}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriends first time coming here. We already had an awesome experience before even getting to the register. Everyone was so helpful and even when I was being shy and whispering to my girlfriend \"what's that?\" He could read my body language and answered all my questions and talked me into trying everything. It was awesome and now I'm waiting to finally get home to try this pizza!!! You guys are so hidden but the girl at the register was bouncing ideas on decking out the place in Christmas lights to get you guys seen more! Awesome experience. Wednesday December 6th at 4:20"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! What's better than  fresh, delicious pizza made right in front of you??? The wife and I come here often and they never disappoint! If  you're looking for something besides pizza, their salads are good size and amazing as well."}
{"text":"Good personal pie you create while standing in line (like a gourmet Subway for pizza's).  Also is fun for the kids to create their own pizza pie!  Not the absolute best pizza around, but definitely worth a try.  I will be going back when in the area."}
{"text":"I like fired pie, I like the concept and I like the price!  $8.00 for a pizza that can feed 2 always works.  Listen, your not going to be stuffed, but it is enough to feed 2 comfortably.  You start by selecting your sauce base, then move on to the toppings (which they have many to choose from).  Then, into the oven it goes.  The oven is so hot, your pizza is out in about 5 minutes with a nice crisp crust ready to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great concept and perfectly executed! Build your own pizza with as many ingredients as you want. The cooking is done in big brick oven and the staff watches very carefully to make sure things don't get burned. Fast service and tasty eats! You cannot go wrong going here for lunch or dinner. There is a homeless issue in the neighborhood and they hang out at the Frys and Target. They do not usually go into the food places."}
{"text":"OMG, absolutely THE BEST pizza I've ever had! Fresh ingredients, light crust, delicious toppings! Can't be beat anywhere! Have to come in at least once for the experience! Try grilled chicken, bacon, pesto w/garlic & oil, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella & parmesean! (Oh and add more veggies of your choice!)"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent, which should be no surprise because I got to put exactly, and I mean exactly, what I wanted on it.  This is a tremendous concept and I applaud them for the large selection of premiums toppings, which are all free assuming you are not getting the cheese pizza.  I totally recommend this place if you have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this fired pie. We usually go to MOD. This fired pie is a new location. The staff was friendly and the food was ok. We had a hard time finding a clean table to sit at and it was NOT busy at all. Not sure what the employees do on down time?"}
{"text":"I got the chicken Alfredo pizza. One bite and hooked. Really good pizza. Love that it's thin crust and all the topping you want for the same price."}
{"text":"Very fresh and high quality ingredients. Waits can be long when they are busy. Service is friendly but setup causes delays when ordering."}
{"text":"Awesome. Today was their grand opening and it was packed (to be expected when free food is involved). I ordered a spicy southwest salad but went 50/50 with greens mix and spinach. I also subbed black olives with kalamata and chicken with buffalo chicken. It was AWESOME! Great job guys."}
{"text":"Love! Love! LOVE! Everything is delish and not a bad price. The steak ans blue cheese pizza on the thin crust is so yummy. I love that you can add and omit whatever you want or make your own since no one can ever agree on toppings. Service is great and food is out fast so great for a quick lunch spot during work or before a game or concert downtown. Highly recommend!  However... be sure if you go after work that they are even open before going since they tend to close on a whim whenever they want. :("}
{"text":"I'll never go to this Fired Pie again! Utterly disgraceful. The work ethic of the employees is a great representation of management; the management at this location must not amount to much. I love Fired Pie and never had such a horrible experience. They seem to have employed a bunch of ppl at this location with no attention to detail or just don't give a fuck about their jobs. The only one I could see seeming to care was the guy at their pos. My pizza wasn't even cooked all the way through. What a terrible disgrace and a black eye for a good pizza franchise. I advise others to eschew from this place."}
{"text":"We've been to the Arrowhead location a few times and each time it gets worse. The food is usually pretty decent, but their service is terrible. The manager is terrible. He is more concerned with flirting with the girls behind the counter than the customers. Tonight, our pizza was so under cooked. Manager was irritated that I asked for an extra plate. I love their good, but their service makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"Ok this is just so simple and ridiculously good. I have only found a few Neopolitan pizza places in my travels that I have enjoyed. Considering the format of Fired Pie with the create your own pizza from the ordering line, my first expectations were really quite low. I have been here a lot now and I can't find much to fault. The variety and quality of the final product is really good. Just go with your gut and order what you want on your pizza. You can put on any combination of any of the ingredients. Be creative and enjoy. I haven't had a bad pie yet. My only recommendation is don't make it too thick with too many toppings.  Give it all a try. I even tried grapes on mine today. Yes grapes! Think of them as an alternate to pineapple. A nice little sweetness, but not too much."}
{"text":"Only downfall, NO PUNCH CARD!!!!!   I eat here at least twice a week and would like to be rewarded for my loyalty. I have nothing else to complain about, pizza is always great.  The floors are clean, toppings look fresh, table tops are clear, staff is always friendly.  I want to open one of these in Gilbert!   Keep up the good work guys! And the manager is a wonderful example of what a manager should be regardless of the business. Very hands on and makes sure every customer is pleased with their visit!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick lunch after taking in an early matinee movie next door. I created my own pizza and appreciated the fresh toppings and variety of options.  I think the thing here is not what you ordered, but the fact that you can combine a myriad of fresh ingredients to your own specifications.  The assembly was a bit slow for a moderately busy weekend lunch, but the cooking was surprisingly quick.  The ultra thin crust is undoubtedly how they cook them so fast. I'm not a huge fan of ultra thin crust, so this wasn't a plus to me. It may have been several factors, including the crust and toppings that I selected, but it took a careful hand to keep the toppings from completely sliding off each slice as I ate it, so that was a bit tideous.  I may try this place again, because the freshness of the toppings and options are worth another try, however my first experience was only so-so because it didn't seem very pizza-like and the finished product was just not very satisfying from a pizza perspective.  Tasty, yes.  Good quality food product, yes.  Decent value for the money, yes.  It just didn't hit the spot for my pizza craving."}
{"text":"I love the idea of adding the ingredients that I want!  the crust is excellent and the toppings are fresh.  The pizza takes about 3 minutes to cook!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed to say how many times I've eaten here in given work week.  (3, shhhh!)  By the time you've filled your drinks at the fountain and found a seat, your piping hot pizza is ready.  I can finish the whole thing too, thankyouverymuch.  Every last stove burnt crumb."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad. Music was terrible, and way too many tables for the amount of space. Bring your own plate....they do not have any! Hard to believe, isn't it?  Bob E. (Glendale, Az) not Leander. Tx)"}
{"text":"Very helpful and friendly staff. They gave me a delicious  cookie desert just for checking in on Yelp. I asked them to write down the name of each order on the pizza boxes, they did, which is helpful when ordering for many coworkers.  Great idea and is like Chipotle for pizza, for around 8 bucks you get a custom made personal pizza."}
{"text":"Good service, tantalizing ingredients. Out of all the make your own pizza places, this place has the best tasting (sometimes) seasoned ingredients, and overall had the highest quality for the price point. I've tried most of the other build your own pizza places, and have found that Fired pie is the only one to consistently use top notch ingredients.  The other places seem bland when compared to Fired pie. Try the spicy sausage (is not very spicy btw), it has great seasoning, and the sun dried tomatoes are on point. They even have fresh, real mozzarella cheese, not just the cheap dried up kind. I love this place, happy we have it in the valley. Another tip for the adventurous types, sometimes I sprinkle some lemon juice over my pizza and it gives it a great kick. Works good with certain  flavor combos. Try it if you dare :)"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Excellent food choices, the ingredients have more personality than the other build a pizza places. The seasonings are better here. This location has a lot more space than other Fired Pie locations! Great for meeting friends or after church or youth group meetings or with a cool friend. My pizza smells soooOOooo good, can't type anymore, must eat lol"}
{"text":"This is a great concept - counter staff builds your pizza or salad in front of you with the toppings you specify -- like a Subway or Chipotle for pizza. The downtown location is a great crowd pleaser for groups and a quick, reasonably priced option for business travelers. Service on the evening we visited was polite but could have been faster."}
{"text":"Twice we've ordered Uber eats and BOTH times they have messed up the order drastically. Not happy about this and there is no way to easy rectify the situation. You don't dare call because their text is most certainly missing. Disappointing, their food is fantastic."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the fact that you can pick and choose what you want on your personal pizza right in front of your face. The pesto chicken pizza is the best thing I've ever tasted. It's perfect because I can have half from lunch and have the other half for dinner. I was super nervous the first time I ordered there because I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza. But this changed my opinion.   The reason it is getting 4 stars is because the people that work there aren't the best. It's like a hit or miss. Sometimes they are super nice and other times they barley acknowledge you with grunts.   Overall, this pizza is delish."}
{"text":"I love this place and location! the people are fast, friendly and I always leave with a smile on my face! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've never been disappointed here. I usually stick with their simple tomato basil pizza but have ventured out a few times. The ingredients are super fresh and the end result is to die for. It's also very reasonably priced. One of my favorite places for lunch!"}
{"text":"Burnt and cold, how's that for juxtaposition! It's an ok pie, I guess it's worth 9 bucks. But let's pull it out sooner and ship it out quicker guys!"}
{"text":"Anna has helped my boyfriend and I many times, and is always a pleasure. We've visited this spot since its opening, and have a strong preference for Fired Pie over Blaze Pizza. Although the last time I visited my order received was not what I had asked for, Anna, immediately stepped up to the plate to accommodate us. The food is tasty, and never soggy. I always look forward to grabbing pizza from here :)"}
{"text":"Never say never. I had posted a poor review of fired pie two weeks and said i would never go there again. A couple of days later I received an email from one of the founders (Fred Morgan) who had offered to replace my pizza. He asked for my address and sure enough he was true to his word and sent me a gift card for another pizza.   The pizza was really good. You can tell that these guys have been in the pizza industry for a long time. Their pies are about the same size as you would get at California Pizza Kitchen, but you get to add your toppings similarly to how you would at subway or at Chipotle.  Also seeing the way that they responded to my earlier posting shows that they understand the importance of client promoters and detractors which in my opinion is a sign of a great company.   Thank you Fred!"}
{"text":"Very good but so so noisy! The pizza and salads are great but the service is eh. I probably wouldn't go back on a weekend."}
{"text":"The basics are custom made 11\" thin crust pies with whatever (and as many) toppings you want for $8.  Cheap, fast, GOOD pizza is an awesome concept.  They make the pie in front of you as you order ala Subway.  This facet is the absolute worst restaurant concept ever.  I went there last Saturday night and the line was out of the door; sounds like a busy place, until you realize that EVERYBODY is in line.  NOBODY is eating.  Again the line is out the door, but at most 20% of the tables are occupied.  This is because of their incredibly stupid (from a restaurant operator standpoint) setup.  Because all the toppings are essentially free, people take forever to make up their mind.  While Grandma is getting the lowdown on the finer points of cappacola, the ENTIRE RESTAURANT IS AT A STANDSTILL!  It should take less than a minute to top a pie.  Here it takes at least 4-5 minutes as you are passed from the worker who sauces the dough, to the meat person, and then to the veggie person.  The result is absurdly long line times.  If they instead seated people, let them make up their minds at a table instead of in line with everyone else behind them, and then submitted the order only after a decision has been made, they could speed up the service significantly.  The ordering mess (and really bad layout behind the counter) also occupies all the employees.  As a result, there was no clean silverware available for about 10 minutes after my pie came out despite asking twice.  That said, the pie was great, especially for $8.  i had the Meaty Italian, the wife got the pesto chicken and we split a steak and Gorgonzola salad.  Would definitely go back, especially on the occasions were I am looking for a late lunch.  Would never go there during regular meal times if I were in the slightest bit of a hurry."}
{"text":"Zach makes the best pizzas I have ever had. Please just go in and ask him to use his amazing culinary creativity. We had a birthday party here last night and it was wonderful. All he needs is a concept to work with and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is garbage and I've had enough of this pathetic customer service and food quality, I've eatin at fired pie before and liked it but this location is terrible and from opening day has been terrible, 6 people working and 1 customer was eating already, we got our food and went to sit down, almost every table was dirty, the 1 drink I get there wasn't working, my food was chewy and stained my fingers from the burnt underside of my pizza, 1 half of my pizza had so much cheese it melted the toppings off the pizza, I've been to mod a mile down the road a ton of times, blows this place out the water"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, easy. But you get what you pay for. The pizza is super thin, most of the time it's cooked unevenly, or burnt or undercooked. But it's cheap, it's quick and you can make it however you want it. Like Chipotle but with pizza."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. My favorite place for thin pizza, never get a bad pizza here. The pizza is the perfect serving size for one person and u can add any toppings u want."}
{"text":"What a cool experience.   Kinda like subway or chipotle for pizza.   You pick the sauce, cheese type & toppings.   And then they cook it in their pizza oven.  Very fresh and delicious.   The staff were very friendly and the restaurant is super clean.   $22 for a family of 3.    I will be back"}
{"text":"I had a veggie pizza from here. Prices are super resonance. The quality is good. It smaller and tasted great. Staff is friendly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Diamond and Ryan are the best!!! They went out of their way with my pain in the butt order and did so with smiles! Love them and will be back! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good pizza.  I have gone to the one off i17 and loop 101 and their crust is super messy.   This place was quick and good.   $22 for 2 custom pizzas and 2 drinks.  They are 11in pizzas so good size for one person.   They give you a good amount of toppings too.   I am liking Fired Pie more and more each time."}
{"text":"Love the idea of this place, fresh, fast, build-your-own pizza! They have a great variety and good options for different dietary needs.  I got a gluten-free crust with marinara sauce and nearly every vegetable offered..no cheese. It was very good, but I did feel a little sick after eating it, not sure why. I did really enjoy it though. My sister ordered a pookie and liked it as well. It was the perfect single serving haha.   This place is also very reasonably priced which is a big plus. You can get whatever you want and they do not really charge extra.   Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I've been here once and I was highly impressed with the food not so much the customer service, but the pizza was yummmmyyy! This will sound odd, but it felt like a subway for pizza, but so much fresher and veggies so much better. Many many options to choose from to create your own delicious pie or they have some suggestions to pick from. The pizzas are cooked in a wood oven and let me tell you that is the ONLY way a pizza should ever be made. My son loved it and he keeps asking to go back and we will! Even though the customer service was ehhhh I will still give them 5, because I honestly went it for the pizza not really focuses on the teammates."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. The pizza is delicious. Gluten free!  Loved it. They carry Diet Pepsi products to drink. Tried the Chicken pesto mmm so delicious."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever.  If your in a crunch for time and or want to sit and enjoy this place is consistently the best.  Freshest ingredients and an awesome staff!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place b/c it's near work during lunch last week.  I had never been.  Wow what a great lunch meal I had.  So many toppings to choose from and the best part was the crispy crust.  It was crunch, held up nicely.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My two friends and I stopped here hungry and left happy. I really like the \"build your own pizza concept\".  The crust was crisp and thin and there was a great selection of toppings to choose from and they were all fresh. The staff albeit were young, were very friendly. If I'm ever back in these parts I would certainly return."}
{"text":"Prices went up for pizza and salad by 20 cents (It happens, sooner or later), but still a good deal for a custom-made pizza or salad.  Staff are still enthusiastic and helpful, have not had a less-than-stellar experience yet.  Question: What happened to the bellinis? (Never tried one, but still... I know they're gone from the web site and from the Park Central location.)  Current prices on web site and in-store as of July 25, 2014: Custom/well-balanced pizza (11\") - $7.95 You build/We build salad - $7.95"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed customizing my pizza at Fired Pie. I chose the traditional sauce, both types of mozzarella, Parmesan, carmelized onions, sauteed peppers, mild and spicy sausage, garlic, and pineapple.  Ordering at the topping buffet was fast and easy, and the pie came out quickly and was delivered to our table. The really thin crust was cooked perfectly, the cheese gooey, and the toppings just warmed. Such deliciousness! I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We eaten at the Fired Pie several times since we read about the place in a Gilbert flyer. We love the place, with the selections. We highly recommend this New Concept to all.  We read some negative comments but we did not find them justified. Maybe they have never been to Sub Way...  I'm looking forward to the chain moving farther east. Currently well worth the drive from Gilbert."}
{"text":"I am so happy that i found this location. I first tried the ahwatukee location after a movie. Now I have one on my side of town. I like that you can custom your pie (pizza) to the toppings that you like. Lots of fresh veggies and meats to pile it up."}
{"text":"Just think of Chipotle ... Pizza Style. Great right!  I am a sucker though. I get the same thing each time. Meat lovers(if you will) made with real mozzarella and all the meat possible. (almost) and extra sauce.   I freakin eat the entire thing EVERY time! Although I am usually full after the 2.5 mark.   Staff was good. They were having fun working which is a nice thing to see, yet made sure the clients were taken care of."}
{"text":"Great service, all the employees seemed engaged, and asked me multiple time if I needed anything. Great recommendations from the line making pizza."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. The people were very in depth when they explained how it works. The line moved fast. The food was lite and did not just sit and your stomach and make you fell bad. It had a unique atmosphere that is busy but welcoming. Overall this place is one of the best places I have eat'n at."}
{"text":"Why didn't I think of this?!  This place is fantastic!  Once the word gets out, this place will be packed.  Usually you have to choose either quality or price.  Not here.  For around 8 bucks, you get to customize your own pie with a nice variety of fresh toppings and the kicker is, it's damn good.  The crust is thin and crispy and just about perfect.  The staff was super friendly, the space was clean and cool looking and the food was great.  A+"}
{"text":"FIred Pie is my favorite pizza restaurant.  I am from Missouri and they don't have a location in my state.  I am here visiting relatives.  My mom and I stopped in the location in SanTan Village (so glad it's close to my family who live in Gilbert). The employees are super friendly and accommodating.  This was my moms first time.  She was very impressed with the salad. Not only was it a lot and they made it exactly like she wanted, she said it was very tasty.   My pizza was totally on point!  I love thin crust pizza.    I encourage anyone to stop by and try it!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Pointer Sisters - Fire)  I'm trying out your pie You turning out your dough You're adding some sauce I just say whoa I say I really like it But you know I'm a Yelper Cause when I sing Ooooh, Fired....(Pie)   Quick, simple, and good!  Fired Pie is a local chain spread throughout the Phoenix valley.    I came here with a friend whom said their salads were amazing!  Well in a pizza joint I'm not ordering salad first off.  I'm sure they're great, but pizza is what I'm shooting for!  Pick and choose your topping is the pretty much the concept.  I chose mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, artichokes, peppercini peppers, capicola and bacon.  Fire roasted in an open fire oven this toasted the thin crust giving it an extra crunch.  The proteins I chose were chewy and salty as it should be, while the peppers provided and fresh pickley bite.  I love artichokes on my pizza since it has it's own distinct smell and taste.    Overall, Fired Pie is unique and fun!  Their service is quick and ordering is simple. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food: 11 inch pizza with unlimited toppings. For the sauce, I chose a combination of Alfredo sauce and pesto. Cheese: mozzarella and Parmesan. Meats: spicy sausage, pepperoni, and bacon. Veggies: spinach, mushrooms, red onions, pineapples, and sun dried tomatoes. The crust wasn't too thin or heavy. It was crunchy and soft at the same time. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. I was pretty impressed with my creation. Lol. Leftovers was just as good! 5/5  Service: Fast and friendly. The guy who assembled my pizza made suggestions when asked. My pizza came out within 5 minutes of ordering it! 11 inch pizza and bottled water for under $10. What a steal! Why go anywhere else for pizza?? 5/5  Final thoughts: This is officially my favorite pizza spot! I loved everything about it! I was legit sad when I finished my leftovers. Lol."}
{"text":"When i used to live in Arizona, this was the place that i like to visit the most. Friendly and quick service. They offer variety of pizza selections. Making your own healthy pizza, I'm a fan! Pesto sauce + crispy crunch + vegetables + spicy sausages = yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I've had almost all their pre-created pizzas and have never been disappointed. I also like how all pizzas are priced the same (except plain cheese is cheaper). One pie is plenty to fill me up, and not very expensive compared to some other lunch places around."}
{"text":"Love this place! Gluten-free crust is awesome! The pizza and salads are delicious. And they are FAST. I've never waited more than 10 minutes for my pizza. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita pizza, the seasoning was very flavorful. Delicious, would love to go back!"}
{"text":"love the concept build your own pizza and salad. the actual food is good as well especially for the prices. it was a little dirty when i went in but i can assume it gets real busy. def. will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, sooo fresh, fabulous salads, great choices...Super friendly staff..Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Im here on a business trip and decided to watch a matinee movie with some free time I had. After the flick, I stepped out of the theater and thanks to my yelp app found this place right outside the movies.  I am so thankful for the app! I got the chicken pesto pizza with TONS of mushrooms and the steak and blue salad with a lemonade. I'll just say this, my 11\" custom pizza was gone in 6 minutes. And I was dining ALONE. I nibbled on the salad to taste and am saving that for lunch tomorrow.  The pizza was out of this world! That crust was nice and crispy. Not too thin and not too thick.  A nice texture and not too doughy.  I'm not a big fan of crust and loved that the toppings went almost all the way to the edge.  It was not oversauced or over seasoned. It was PERFECT.  The salad was killer too. But I literally two two bites and put the rest away. I was stuffed.  The fresh squeezed lemonade was a refreshing way to end the meal. a million stars from me!"}
{"text":"It's really just terrible pizza. The concept is great and the staff is friendly and helpful but truly unsavory pizza. Maybe the salads are better because you can't really mess that up? Been here twice and this is definitely the last time. Sorry guys, I gave it a go!"}
{"text":"I was in last on June 16th with my wife, the place was packed with hardly any seats open and a line to the door. I was very surprised at how quickly we made it through the line and received our pizzas. The employees were definitely hustling but also very friendly. Even their manager was busy smashing the dough, running the oven, and delivering the pizzas to the customers. The food is excellent and that's why we're back tonight.  Again, it's busy, but this business knows what they're doing by hiring the right people. Quite refreshing!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The only other place I been to is Pizza Studio in downtown Phoenix. Although I think the pizza is a little smaller, it's also cooked in a different way. Instead of a conveyor belt oven, it's actually a fire oven. Extra crispy though and different texture.   The taste is pretty good and on par with Pizza studio. I think there may be more ingredients here, but I couldn't put as much ingredients on because of the smaller size. What's impressive was that the pizza cooked in 2 minutes as opposed to 5-10 minutes at Pizza Studio.  Well, the prices are about the same so I guess either place would be fine. I think there are more Fired Pie places and only one Pizza Studio in Phoenix area. So like both places, I give them 4 stars for fast delicious unlimited toppings pizza!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is not bad. I like how they have anchovies too! Given the option, I would go to Pizza Studio, but there is only location in downtown Phoenix. What I realize about Fired Pie was that they count the ingredients they put on the pizza or they strategically place the ingredients here and there. So on the pizza, there could be only 4 pieces of salami or something like that every time.  At Pizza Studio, they generously sprinkle the ingredients on there. I've had pizzas at Pizza Studio where the pizza was loaded and heavy. Here at Fired Pie, it never happens.  That's my only gripe. I know most people don't want their pizza loaded with toppings. But I do. Everything is still delicious though!"}
{"text":"This location wasn't bad, and the staff was pretty friendly. I been to other locations where they are just so unenthusiastic and will skim on the toppings. This server was very patient and just kept asking if I wanted more toppings. And we just chatted and more and more toppings were added on. I think the pizza is usually mediocre but this time, the pizza tasted pretty nice. I still recommend Pizza Studio as the GO TO place for this type of pizza style restaurants. They don't skim on toppings and the pizza has different flavor crusts."}
{"text":"Individual pizza at your desire. I love the crust, is thin and crispy. I don't like thick fatty crust. This pizza brought me memories of good times while I worked close by over a year ago. Their quality hasn't gone down and is open on weekends longer hours."}
{"text":"It was fast, tasty, and at a great price. I love how fresh everything is and how they customize it to the way you want it. Their salads are awesome too, and completely customizable. The restaurant was very clean and the service was extremely friendly. We ordered our meal to go, and it was perfect when we got home.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's hard to review a place like Fired Pie. This small locally owned pizza place delivers a fast alternative to fast food. A few things did not impress though. If this could be a 3.5 it would, but it's very close to getting that 4/5.   Why Go There: The concept is trendy and in, many cities are embracing the \"Chipotle\" model of pizza. Fired Pie launched in Phoenix not long ago, they have a very affordable menu, custom pizzas and even pre-designed pizzas alike. They are fast and simple to order from.  Why the 3/5 rating: This place like its other location near the University of Phoenix Stadium struggle with the same issue. Cleanliness, attention to its guests and overall experience. It's a shame since the food is great for a place to get a meal under $10 that is not your topical fast food. Sadly it resides with the managers and staff that work there taking care of the front of house. The pizza makers are young high school aged kids who seem to do well, but after you get your food, you cannot help but to stare at the trash on the floor, trays piling up by the trash, crumbs left on the tables by previous guests... we had to wipe down our own table in front of a few workers even. Sitting there for 45 mins with plenty of tables being turned over, we never saw the staff wipe down a table and chairs or sweep the mess.  Overall: This is a fam friendly spot, though its attention to the guests after food is delivered lacks. It's great for a pick up order as it stands right now. Fired Pie needs to step up the fostering of its environment for people to feel like they are in a special dining establishment, with that price point and fresh ingredients, lines should be out the door and the dining room should be packed."}
{"text":"I met friends here for lunch before going to the symphony. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. I wanted to get a gluten-free vegan pizza, but they told me that the gluten-free crust has egg in it. I don't have celiac, and I'd rather eat gluten than hurt an animal, so I got the regular crust. Without asking, the staff go a new container of tomato sauce (the other one had a could pieces of cheese in it) and they sweep out the oven before putting in my pie. When they brought my pizza to my table, the server said they got a fresh knife to cut it.  Overall, my pizza was good - their crust is super thin and I topped it with a little vegan cheese (it wants to be as good as real cheese, but it's not), olives, mushrooms, and peppers.  Their bathrooms are labled \"ladies\" and \"gents,\" although they are single-user bathrooms. The ladies was in use so I used the gents restroom without any issue."}
{"text":"Lots of toppings to choose from on a perfectly fired thin crust. All the toppings you want for the same $8. Like Chipolte only Pizza. Yummy!!! I had BBQ sauce, cheese, chicken, bacon, little pineapple, red onion, black olives. The new guy from NY is friendly and made great pies for us. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place really is great. The people who work here are so nice and friendly. I am gluten-free, and they have a wonderful gluten-free crust! Two options even! Everyone one on the line will ask if you want them to change their gloves before they touch your gluten-free pizza. I love this place. It is delicious and so great! Well worth any wait in line you may have!"}
{"text":"This concept makes a lot of sense.  A quick pizza at a reasonable price.  Choose a pizza off their menu or create your own.  My creation had sausage, olives and basil and it was delicious if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"I was in for lunch on Sunday and had a not so great experience.  There were four people ahead of me waiting to order. It took me ten minutes to actually get up to the register and get my pizza order started.  After I paid it took another thirteen minutes to actually get my pizza.  By this time I should have been done with my meal and out the door instead of just getting started.  The pizza itself was good but management needs to up their game in the service department.  This is a crowded restaurant category and there are a lot of other choices in town."}
{"text":"Like Subway but for pizza, as in you pick your toppings.  It was tasty and I'm sure it'd be awesome before a game."}
{"text":"I love this place. I been here about 5 times and always want to come back, pizza is so delicious and cooked perfectly. Its like a subway sandwich style build your own pizza system. Tons of options and topings. I am a army veteran and they gave me a free pizza of my chose on Veterans Day! Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Those who called this the Chipotle of pizza were spot on. Actually, it was better than I expected. Service was good overall and everyone was helpful. We ended up ordering salad, but it was good, and surprisingly filling for the price. The pizzas looked great too and if we go back I'm sure we'll try one eventually. Prices were pretty reasonable for the fast casual line and it was nice to see everything being made in front of you."}
{"text":"Thin crust personal pizzas that are made to order and cooked in a super hot oven so they're ready in a flash. Very tasty!  They have some suggested combinations of toppings to choose from. Otherwise, you pick your sauce (red, pesto, olive oil, or BBQ); then you pick your cheese(s), and toppings. Pizza is made to order and ready in a few minutes. Yummy pizza with home made crust that is both crispy and pleasantly chewy and a soda for $10.  For those of you that know Sauce, this is very similar, every bit as good or better, and a great value. It is also faster than Sauce, which is a bonus if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  You can choose one of their recommended pizzas or create your own. The pie was fired in a huge open brick oven. Their Pepsi machine can be mixed with any flavor combination you like. The price was right and the wait short. You can sit in or out. Service excellent. A definite plus. Will be returning."}
{"text":"We had fired pie delivered by UberEats tonight. It was so good!  The kids had cheese pizzas. My husband had the steak and blue, and I had the gluten free pesto pizza. The gluten free dough is good. I think it might be Udis but I can't confirm that. It's just tastes and looks like Udis crust used at other pizza places. Gluten free is $2 more.  Thinking that they were personal pies, we ordered way to much but left over pizza is always good!"}
{"text":"I gave it another try and noticed some improvements.  So I've gone back several times afterwards.  Really appreciate the follow-up to my review and it shows that they care about customer feedback.  Fired Pie has become one of my favorite places for pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously addicted to this place.  What an amazing concept of the fast casual pizza place that has great topic choices and more than two types of cheeses!! I love that you can literally load on the topics for the build your own choice and they dont charge extra. The people are always friendly and personable even if they are in the middle of the hectic lunch rush!  Love this place, the food and the concept!"}
{"text":"I got so sick here not good and the manager just said no one else complained never again"}
{"text":"Similar concept and price as Pieology in Irvine -- Unlimited toppings on an 11\" pizza for $8...how can you go wrong? From the creative (making 2 different halves on 1 pizza) to the artisanal to the economical (everything on it plz!) you can eat any kind of pizza possible.  For ingredients they have a fairly decent selection of meats and veggies but not as much as Pieology. Still, it's definitely enough for me though. And being so close to the hospital, I will definitely be back soon yumz"}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza place!!! How can u beat your very own customized pizza made just for u?? With fresh ingredients and anyway you want it?? For under $8 bucks?? Amazing place, they definitely need to expand and take over subways! Lol pizzas are made perfectly with a perfect crust! The dough is not too thick and not too thin just perfect amount to tie the pizza together! Pizzas are bigger than your average \"personal sized pizzas\" enough for even leftovers! So good!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on Saturday, and were very pleased with our experience. The service was excellent, and the food was good as well. This restaurant is in our neighborhood, and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"So far the best pizza in AZ. Number 1 best pizza we've ever eaten was in Naples, Italy.. 2nd best pizza we've ever eaten was in Rincon, Puerto Rico...3rd best pizza we've ever had was fired pie in Chandler, AZ! I grew up in a pizza restaurant so I am super pizza picky!! Enjoy delicious thin crust at a great price!!!)"}
{"text":"Incredible! Any amount of toppings you want and all the same price. Come here at least once a week and get a slightly different pizza each time, all good. Also the \"fired pookie\" is basically slightly cooked cookie dough and when done right is 10/10! Depends on cook that day though. Overall, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy three BYO place, didn't have any topping issues that others mentioned. Love the smaller salads now offered! Sometimes it's just not always clean and stocked."}
{"text":"Best $7.75 pizza around!!!  All the cheese & topings you want!  In a great central PHX location, easy to get to on the light rail as well.  Give them a try,  you won't be dissapointed!  Lunch wth iced tea, less than $11!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and salad were delicious.  The employees are nice and patience.  This was our first time and we could not decide what to order.  Everything was so good.   I will be back.  The salad was so good that my husband ate it before I put the dressing on it.  Everything was great.  I will be coming back.  The best pizza I had in a long time."}
{"text":"We have been to Fired Pie in Ahwatukee many times and it is always good, fast, and made with quality ingredients. Last night we went to the Chandler location, took the pizza home, had two bites and threw it directly in the garbage. It was dripping in oil, covered in black cornmeal due to the fact they hadn't cleaned out their oven, and the crust itself was burnt. The cheese was thrown on in clumps making some of the pizza almost inedible (and trust me, I love cheese). I don't understand the massive inconsistencies between locations but we will never be back to this location.  Update: It was very generous of their owner to offer us coupons to try it again- like I said, it is usually very good! It might have just been an off night for this location."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!! Pizza, salad, service-outstanding! Yummy! Plus, the beer and wine option is great.  Just visiting the area, but if I lived here, Fired Pie would be a regular option for dinner. FYI, we live near a Pieology, Fired Pie is 100% better!"}
{"text":"Came here with a fairly large group, and even though their pizza setup is mostly for individuals or pairs, they had no problem accommodating our group. They were patient with us and respectful.  The pizza and salads are very good! Thin, crispy crust supports whatever pizza combo you want. Flavor was spot on! The salads I think were more for an individual wanting a salad as their meal, but they gave us extra bowls upon request so we could share.  Prices are great! Two people could eat here for around $10 if splitting an 11\" pizza or a salad. That's hard to find at a pizza place these days. It also works out well when your group wants to try several different pizzas.  When the manager found out we were there after the funeral of one of his past patrons, he was super sweet and said he wanted to do something for us. He threw in some cookies and ice cream, which were awesome! But really the sentiment meant more than anything else.  Awesome place and will definitely come back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The best pizza I ever had, the crust was well cooked and crunchy the topping are fresh and the sauce is amazing"}
{"text":"This place simply rocks! I had hoped I would visit a unique restaurant in Phoenix, but my chances were looking slim. Fortunately, curiosity was my better and I discovered Fired Pie where you can build your own pie or choose one off the menu for $7.95. No extra costs. Amazing!  I built one of the tastiest pizza pies I've ever had with a garlic olive oil base, mix of mozzarella and feta cheese, some capicola with sausage, roasted peppers, white onions, sundried tomatoe, and wilted spinach. The secret? Take it easy on the ingredients, choose good colors and contrasting flavors. My taste buds thank me."}
{"text":"I have come here before and have had really awesome experiences. However this time was different employees seem to care about entertaining themselves and taking care of the customer. I also requested extra sauce and was denied in the past they have always been more than happy to accommodate my request. It wasn't a good experience however my experiences were good so I'll  try this place again however not anytime soon."}
{"text":"i'm a FAN!  Staff is very friendly, salads and pizza are great!  I have gone several times since stumbling upon it!  My favorite thing is the choice of sauces.  I'm not a fan of red sauce so the garlic, pesto and BBQ sauces are great!"}
{"text":"Pizza goes fast food, as you have to stand in line to order.  And just when you find a spot to sit, they call your name.  Despite it being fast food, the pizza is actually pretty good.  It's thin, crispy, and you pick your toppings.  The salads are great too."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight. I usually go to the location downtown but didn't want to drive that far tonight. The restaurant was super clean and the staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely in love! Can pick a million different toppings for a flat rate of $7.95! You can be as creative as you want and every pizza is amazing. I am a huge fan of Fired Pie and will be coming back a million times over. 1 pizza can be spit between two people if you get a salad or something else on the side. Its perfection."}
{"text":"Love the concept. Love the taste. Love Love Love the price. Went in the first time and everything was so easy to follow. We didn't have to wait long at all, for fresh pizza. Very impressed."}
{"text":"So we went in and the first thing we noticed was that they were serving wilted looking romaine lettuce, which no other restaurant in town was because of the recall due to e-coli.  When I asked the server about that she had no idea what I was talking about.  Fine, I thought, I just won't order romaine.    I then asked for a gluten free pizza and when she pulled out the crust (one of those pre-made bread ones) it had green fuzzy MOLD spots all over it.  She threw it in the garbage and went to the back to grab what was hopefully a new fresh bag.  I reluctantly asked for just oil on it and moved on to my next pizza.    So then I ordered a pizza on regular pressed dough, and the one she grabbed was all dry and crusty looking in spots so I asked for a fresh one from the bottom, (someone was just pressing fresh ones that looked much better), and she actually informed me that it was company policy to serve the oldest ones first.  I told her I just saw Moldy old products and didn't trust the old ones so please let me have a fresh one.  SHE REFUSED.  And told me that everything was fresh. (Ha!).  So, that being strike 3, we left and had a much better meal elsewhere at Blaze pizza.    I don't know about other Fired Pie restaurants, but stay away from this location because obviously they  do not care and specifically train their employees to not care about the ingredients they are serving to their customers."}
{"text":"First YUM!  They have gluten free dough and toppings that are delicious.  Just about every restaurant offers gluten free pizza as an option but they often lack taste, texture, and variety of toppings.  Not Fired Pie!  You build your own pizza.  I have no issue going through the line to actually see my toppings and pick out what works for me.  Usually chicken and a ton of veggies.  I have to mention a lot of places soak their chicken in some kind of wheat sauce that makes it inedible for gf people... not Fired Pie!  Totally excellent produce and chicken. I almost always have pesto pizza.    Ok the parking is difficult in this plaza but I have no issue walking a bit across the parking lot.  There's lots of fun places in this shopping center!  It's not the vendors fault, it's just laid out awkwardly for all the businesses.  I usually get my order to go as it is a small seating area. It'd be awesome if they could extend outside with patio service, I'd probably come more frequently during the cooler months."}
{"text":"I eat here what feels like all the time. Probably b/c it's just downstairs from my office. I've tried a couple of the \"build your own pizza\" places in downtown and this one is my favorite. Something about the crust I really like. It adds just enough to the pie without being overbearing. Pizza is about the combination of dough, sauce, cheese and toppings and too much dough is just wrong. I usually get the meaty Italian (which is weird because I used to be a vegetarian). There is so much good stuff piled on that sucker! Yum. Me. If you've got self discipline you can split a pie with a friend or save half for later. It can easily be two meals. If you lack self control like me, you will probably devour the whole thing and wonder why you can't keep your eyes open while reviewing those sales reports in the afternoon. They offer salads in the same \"build your own\" method. The salads are huge as well and could also be shared/saved for later.  Best part? Less than $10 a pop. Fast, tasty and affordable? No wonder I'm here all the time!"}
{"text":"My family and I come to this fired pie location very frequently. Every time we go, we are valued and treated so well. This experience was not pleasant, why is why i went down a few stars. We did get there about 40min before closing. The people behind the counter were rude and annoyed after ordering. Generally a great place but try not to come before closing!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly customer service and great food. Clean establishment and nice patio area. Only complaint are the stupid small cups they give you for water. I hate when places do that make them seem cheap. They offer healthy food like salads but you want water(so as not to have soft drinks) we have to give you a small child cup to punish you."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and do far great service both times. I like a light baked crust and the did it for me. Turned out perfect. Staff was very courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I love the fact you can customize your pizza however you want and they don't charge extra for it. Even subway charges for bacon or extra cheese. Reasonable price in my opinion since it will feed you for at least two meals. Taste was very fresh even on a slow Sunday night."}
{"text":"Problem is not with pizza - you get what you get - problem is where pizza is ordered and not cooked. See photo- that is a five pizza backup for the oven, but the oven has no pizza in it. I watched the oven tender fiddle with one pizza looking at its semi burnt bottom a number of times and then remove other pizzas without putting new ones in - and then deliver the removed pizzas without putting new ones in! This is inexplicable and poor pizza oven management. The multiple people (3) who ordered after me got their pizza delivered before me. Furthermore, when I inquired politely about my pizza's status, I was met with a curt response from the register minder. These are a monumental service issue that should be addressed.   Last bit of advice for fired pie patrons - just go to blaze where the pizza is less expensive,tastier, and comes out quicker- plus there is a greater drink selection."}
{"text":"What a great concept to build your own pizza or salad! $8 and some change to build your own 11in thin crust pizza with whatever toppings you like. There is a ton of options to chose from. You pick your sauce, cheese, and toppings. They then throw it in the brick oven and it's ready within 5-7 minutes. This place can get really busy so it's good to have your order ready in your mind before hand.   The pizza was really good. Super fresh and hot! It's the perfect size to fill you up! My only complaint is the staff was not friendly at all. All 6-7 of them were like robots. No smiles and just quick blunt questions to get you out of there way. I felt rushed and awkward going through the line. Like I was burden.   Hopefully the staff was having a bad night and it's not like that all the time. But the food is super good and love the concept of trying something new each time. I would recommend to go! (: great way for each person to get their own kind of pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The Staff are extremely friendly and food is phenomenal.  I like going here at least once a week.  I love how you can add as many toppings as you want on the pizza"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a great concept serving very good pizza.   That said, I do not completely understand the romance of 'make your own pizza'. I had visualized it more literally, as an actual hands on experience. Frankly, I'm relieved that it was not, as friendly employees help me build whatever pizza I would like. That being said, Pizza Hut will gladly do the same.  But, Fired Pie does it very well. They do thin crust pizza, and it comes our crispy and tasty, with a great balance of chew. The various sauce choices (pesto, tomato, BBQ) and wide variety of ingredients allow for you to get exactly the pizza you want.  The pizza in not too expensive, and there are soft drink as well as beer and wine available. This is a great casual place for a great meal.  I do agree with others, if you plan around peak times you will get in and out, but it can get very busy!"}
{"text":"If you looking for a quick and tasty personal pizza this is a nice place to go. This pizza place reminds me of subway, you pick your topping and they cook it up and yum. It's not what I would consider a premier pizza place but for what it is the pizza comes out very tasty and since it's totally personalized you get exactly what you like.  Atmosphere is not what's its known for but hey you can order it and just take it home."}
{"text":"I got an 11'' pizza with red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and half steak & chicken. It couldn't have taken more than a few minutes to cook, and every ingredient was cooked pretty much to perfection. The steak wasn't tough, the chicken wasn't dry, everything was really well done. The crust is very thin, but I don't mind that at all. Also ordered a 'Fried Pookie' for dessert, which is basically warm cookie dough with vanilla ice cream on top, and while it was a bit small, it tasted incredible. Their lemonade was good too.  Employees were kind, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Heather the manager was amazing  always such a pleasure experience. Pizzas fresh, taste great, and employees are always smiling! Thanks for always make date night a great night"}
{"text":"The pizza was hot and had melted cheese. Beyond that the pizza is not tasty. The crust is previously frozen and it tastes like pizza made on saltine crackers. The salad was good but the pizza lacks what makes delicious pizza. Big selection of toppings that were not bad but not worth going back."}
{"text":"Loved it! The crust was great and the choice of toppings was fantastic! We really enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"For a quick and easy pizza, it's hard to go wrong.  This is the Chipotle of pizza.  It sounds crazy in concept, especially given how long pizza generally takes, but the value is pretty solid for the amount of food you receive (12'' pizza typically costs about $8.50 or so).  If you want an authentic pizza I'd look elsewhere, but for some good date-night-in-the-house food you don't need to look too much further."}
{"text":"Went to Fired Pie after the D'Backs game. They were the only pizza joint open that was near the stadium. Pleasantly surprised at the quality and tastiness of their pizzas! Had the Meaty Italian and the Veggie. They have great ingredients that are fresh and the dough is quite good...thin and crispy. Cooked to perfection and very fast.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.   Only gripe is the lack of regular tables, but understand it is more of a lunch place.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy the pizza and salads at fired pie. Once of the best things about a place like this is that you can pretty much add anything to your pizza or your salad and you are not charged more for it.   My kids always get a cheese and sauce pizza which is good. This trip my wife and I split the 4 meat pizza and added black olives and artichoke hearts. My mom was with us on this trip and she got a pepperoni pizza and added pineapple. All of the pizzas were really good and well worth the price. As an added bonus, if you ever buy anything off of the Amazon food truck and they are stopped parked in the parking lot next to fired pie, they usually have a BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"We were out shopping at Tanger outlet and my son and I got hungry so we noticed this place and thought we would give it a try. I liked the fact that I could choose my own toppings (which they had a big selection of) you wait about 15 mins for them to bake it. For those of you who enjoy a drink they carry a small selection of wines and beers. For the non drinkers there is China mist fresh brewed tea, lemonade and a selection of Pepsi products. The pizza was good and will stop by again on my next shopping adventure."}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck pizza out there, I would say. Basically a Subway BUT PIZZA. You choose what you want on it and virtually no limits. Pretty good size and they make it right there. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Super sweet employees I love this place I love coming here best pizza in town will be back soon very professional staff is very knowledgeable about the toppings pleasant experience every time I come here"}
{"text":"Fired pizza  11\" for $8 ..lots of toppings  to choose  from. I didn't  see the sign  if any toppings are included .  I got 2 toppings ,  I was unsure  if there was extra  fee for more toppings .  The sign was confusing .  But the food  was good .  Table  was a lil dusty  buy I took  care of that with some  napkins  ."}
{"text":"I was able to view a local show on PBS called \"check please\" and with all the gourmet build your own pizza places there was a piece on this establishment. I have heard about fired pie and did not know that they are locally owned and that was another intriguing fact that urged me to venture to a new pizza place! Walking in the menu is pretty well laid out with your choices of build your own and specialty toppings. I chose the build your own route since I am all about the white sauce! My toppings included fresh mozzarella, Canadian bacon bits, mushrooms, black olives, and garlic. Cooked in a brick style over with wood fired chips the flavors were amazing! As you know or may not know had to try there teas and came out a delicious and fresh tasting passion tea!"}
{"text":"We've tried blaze and pieology (which are both pretty great), so we decided it was time to try fired pie as well! They did not disappoint. :) I loved that the vegan cheese wasn't extra cost - that is a huge plus to me. The topping selection is great as well. The customer service was very nice, and the establishment is extremely clean. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My first experience was pleasant. A personal pizza and quite a variety of ingredients to choose. Good service and i will be back again."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle but with pizza: build your own and it's all amazing. I had pepperoni with white sauce to go. The pizza was the perfect size for 1-2 people, it was very flavorful and the bread was tender and fluffy. And now I'm craving it again just writing about it. This place is new, but great. Even the box designs show the thought put into this place. Give 'em a chance, I know I will...repeatedly."}
{"text":"This place............LET ME TELL YOU!. I walked in checked out the prices, menu and i look over at this glorious toppings they provide you with. I go with alfredo sauce which they drizzle and do a z on the pizza they do not over sauce which is great for a thin crust pizza need to have the toppings stay. BUT back to my story I choose the cheese meats and some oregano to finish it off. I get my beverage and proceed to sit down. 6-7 minutes go by BAM my creation has erupted from the oven RIGHT INTO MY FACE. This creation is legitimately the best pizza ive had super thin such a crunch its almost like eating a cracker but alot better with a cornmeal finish to it which is GREAT....Grimaldis? $22 pizza uhh no, Mellow Mushroom $26 pizza UHH NO. I love oreganos and everybody i know, knows how much i love oreganos THIS PLACE IS BETTER. But legit this place is seriously the beeeezzz knees. Please try it FOR ME! You will not be saddened at all by the deliciousness of Fired PIe."}
{"text":"Good tasting food.  Service lacks some polish. Went for second time bringing my son.   No one asked if we wanted any crust toppings, so when our pizzas were assembled, my son asked for one.  They were upset that he didn't ask sooner.  Well that's what you get when you don't know how to talk to a new customer.   Chairs are uncomfortable and they only have one napkin dispenser that had 3 napkins in it.   7 employees working at the time.   No excuse for that."}
{"text":"Seems like we find our way here once a week. Their thin crust is awesome. You can order each pizza exactly how you want it. No more \"per topping\" pricing like most other pizza joints. They have outdoor seating too, so go for it when it's nice out. I only wish they had garlic bread too. If you haven't tried this place yet, put it on your list. What's my favorite pizza you ask?  It would have to be the chicken pesto (smacking lips). They put fresh mozzarella on it- the perfect touch!"}
{"text":"Its a great place for the price! They even have 2 choices of gluten-free crusts which I use every time. You can create any combination you want! Great service & friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good! The crust isn't the same because they seem to burn it or it has too much bubbles after its cooked. The quality isn't there anymore and that's to bad. I have no other words to describe it."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have one near my office that I love so when I seen one opening neat my home I was soooooo happy. This new location is great. .. staff was nice,  location was clean,  food was amazing! Will be back 4sure!"}
{"text":"As a first time customer here, I am very pleased! I ordered the Italian salad for and and a veggie pizza to go! The staffed seemed nice, they were very busy as it is during the lunch rush (1130am). Polite and quick paced, so if you are on the go this would be a great place to eat. The reason for the 4 stars is because the person on the pepperoni station put frozen pepperoni on my salad and another person down the line (they work in an assembly like kind of like Chipotle) had to take them off and put them in the oven for me. Thank you for whoever you are man. But needless to say, my salad tastes awesome and very filling! Can't wait to try the pizza. Dining in was good too. Oh and the prices are super awesome and reasonable!"}
{"text":"I love their GF herb crust and the fact that it's thin. All the toppings appear to be fresh but the pizza builder is very frugal in her efforts to build the pizza with meat, especially. I'm sure they are watching their expenses, but come on, 6 small pieces of chicken? If you're lucky, you can get a booth to sit in because there's limited booth seating and much more table seating instead. I hope the employees actually test their soda fountain because their syrup for drinks isn't mixed well. All the drinks taste funny. Most employees are friendly but should probably consider their attire when they're at work. Daisy Dukes don't really cut it, especially when it's a family-like establishment. I'm a fan of the pizza, not anything else. The restaurant is always clean and the tables are cleared off, I didn't expect to bus my own table though."}
{"text":"Great pizza but the employees need to smile more. They looked like they where ready to smack somebody!"}
{"text":"Have you ever seen Zootopia? The part where the the sloths are at the DMV? Yeah. That's what this place is like.  Stood in line forever. Once we made it to the food line, it was like every server was in slow motion. Giggling and talking about pizza ingredients does NOT help with efficiency. We had to ask for our salad to be put up with he rest of our party because the employee kept putting pizzas in front of it. The boss was hustling--his employees were NOT."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Fired Pie you should try it. For $8.79 you get a 12\" pizza with your choice of toppings or a salad with your choice of toppings.    I change it up every time and ask for well done and square cut."}
{"text":"Like the subway of pizzas. You get to pick which toppings you want on your pizza. It is great for families so everyone can have their own funky pizza. I like the fact that their pizzas are thin crust. You should also try their salads."}
{"text":"Really happy to see a decent and unique food choice come to our neighborhood!  I love pizza and always have.  I have a recent Celiac diagnosis and have been trying gluten free pizza to find good ones.  Pizza Me! has one of the best gluten free crusts in the state!  No kidding - it doesn't have that artificial taste or off-putting texture like I've found in so many others.  The pizza is a fresh and light style that is a nice change of pace.  My husband has liked all that he has tried (he does the traditional crust) and also loves the fact the the place carries Devil's Ale in cans!  We've never eaten in - we are waiting until the weather turns nicer and we'll enjoy the patio - and carryout is quick and easy!  We have already been a few times and will continue to go.  The staff is always nice and inviting and we've met the owner, Earl.  The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Like Subways for pizza but on a whole 'nother level!!!!   $7.95 for an 11-inch pizza (they have gluten free for $2 more) and you can customize as you wish, there's no up charge for certain ingredients. They also have salads, you can customize or choose one of their recipes.  The ingredients were high quality. I saw some dried meats up on there and not only did they have regular mozzarella, hey had fresh mozzarella AND fontina!   Lots of great veggies from a pinch to fresh tomatoes to artichokes to sweet peppers. They are generous with the cheese and everything else is sprinkled evenly.  And that crust though! It looks thin and quite unassuming, but puffs, crisps up, and folds up beautifully! It looks like they bake it in a brick oven!   So good and so yummy! Would be a frequent visitor if one of these was in DFW!"}
{"text":"Fired Pizza. Take Chipotle and turn it into a pizza place, viola! It was a tasty treat, a choose your own adventure. I decided to choose a red sauce, a couple of cheeses (because I can), pepperoni and bacon (I said because I can!!) And finally pepperoncinis and pinapple (shhh...because I can). They fired it in the oven and I waited like five minutes. Then I had a personal pizza. What made my day was seeing a stack of half pizza boxes for people's left overs. I didn't use one. I ate the entire delicious pie (because I can) My only complaint was the selection of toppings. Not that there weren't enough mind you and not that there were too many. It was that you have other people ordering in front of you. Now you have to wait for them to decide whether to put sausage or spicy sausage on their pesto pizza or if they should get grilled onions. Come on lady, my pizza is done and ready to get cooking. Move!!! Get out the way!!! (BECAUSE I CAN!!!)"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, chipotle style order, friendly customer service, fresh ingredients, thin crust, loved it....."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice concept, kind of like a subway-style way of ordering but with pizza. The pizzas are pretty good and are served up fast. One pizza is a suitable meal for one if you're super hungry or have a big appetite, if you're not quite as hungry you may end up with. leftover slice or two. One thing to note is the pizza really doesn't keep well. Normally I love leftover pizza but they don't put a lot of sauce on and the crust is very thin so leftovers are pretty dry. The salads here are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Of all the \"create your own\" pizza places, my family agrees that Fired Pie is the best. This new location in Riverview does a good job with their pizzas, I just don't care for the layout at all. The area where you order, pay, and get your drinks is all crammed together in a tight little space. Employees will be brushing past you with hot pizzas in their hands, and there is almost always a bottleneck at the drink station. The bathrooms are also crammed back in the midst of all this.  I know they have to work with the space they have, but this location was planned poorly. The pizzas taste fine though, so I guess you just have to ignore the rest."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! I am so excited that there's one in So Phx. But it was so cold inside."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place, the Westgate location is a bit far for us but like other Fired Pie restaurants the pizza is great, the service is fast, and minimal wait times."}
{"text":"I think this place has nailed it with the fast pizza option! The pesto pizza is my favorite!  The crust is nice and crispy and not too greasy! super great! Staff is always so pleasant and ready to help! So glad they moved into the area right by work, I have gone far too many times already. But hey they are super consistent, so who could blame me. Wishing Continued success to the team!"}
{"text":"the Freshly made pizza is one of the best in the central corridor !  all the fresh toppings prepared daily , and the Salads made to order are the best !  but what's even better than the Fresh Pizza and Salads ?  THE STAFF !   This staff run by one of the most caring professional Managers HEATHER is absolutely the best !  I've been in this place at once if not twice a week, and it never fails that one or All will call me out and welcome me as if I were just there !   Heather Anthony and Alma are some of the best customer service members across the board !  the food is Great and the staff is even Better !    Thank You ALL and please keep up the great work and Life is a Pizza !   ciao ciao !  ric Lopez"}
{"text":"Yummy food but TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! This chain could learn a thing or two about customer service from Chick-FIL-A or In-n-Out! The employees at Fired Pie act completely irritated with the customers and only seem interested in talking to each other. The only reason I return is because the pizza is so darn good and so reasonably  priced. Every time I go, I swear it's going to be the last, but within a few weeks, I talk myself into returning, HOPING I will be treated like my business is wanted. I really hope the location that is coming to 75th Avenue and The 101 hires FRIENDLY employees!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but they are very stingy with toppings. I felt like I had to keep asking \"more please. Still more.\" And I'm not that greedy."}
{"text":"Went to order 2 pizzas. While standing in line to order, which by the way took a little to long for not much business. Anyway I noticed an open plastic tray of pizza dough balls right next to a garbage can next to the hand washing sink. Employees throwing hand wash towels in to that garbage are really to close to the open container of raw dough. Kind of freaked me out. Maybe should take care of this. I am not a food inspector but I wanted to tell the manager. I will be interested if this gets taken care of before my next visit."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have stated, the best description of this place is a \"Subway for Pizza\" with some gourmet toppings and a ready to eat pizza in about 10 minutes.  Apparently, my family claims,  I have been here before.  I don't recall.  Either way, the pizza is fun to make, you choose from multiple toppings and then the high school kid behind the counter places it in an open \"pizza oven.\"  All our pizza turned out tasty, with a crunchy crust and fairly well cooked toppings.  The only glitch is my younger son ordered a plain cheese pizza with regular pizza sauce.  It came out burnt and over half the pizza \"bubbled up.\" Essentially inedible for a seven year old with no front teeth.  They offered to remake it and we took them up on their offer.  The old pizza was left on the table and a new one was brought out after about 7 minutes, along with a free pizza coupon.  Nice touch but I prefer the pizza would be made correctly the first time.  Anyway, the cheese would not stay on the cheese pizza, a problem we did not encounter on the other pizzas."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. Very nice sized personal pizza with whatever topping you want. Crust  could be a bit less oily, but I choose to overlook the detail. Good tomato sauce and bunch of veggies is all I ask for in a pizza. Well at least from fast food pizza joint I turn to when I'm running on fumes.  Salads are pretty huge as well. If you're feeding more than one or two it can easily get very pricey, but to be fair the quality is far above Dominos or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"After arriving back at my office down the street from this gem, only to notice my leftover pizza from lunch (from a competitor that shall remain nameless) had been STOLEN out of the work fridge (leftover thieves are literally the scum of the Earth) by a colleague of mine. I decided I was on a mission to ignore my cholesterol and live my dream of having pizza for lunch followed by pizza for dinner! Well, thank Italian Jesus for this glorious culinary masterpiece! Fast casual Pizza? Are you kidding me?! The obvious comparison is Chipotle, it even has similar decor, but if that's who you're being compared to in the food industry, you're doing something right! Let me tell you, this place is. I will DEFINITELY be back and more then likely end up opening the eyes of the pizza thief on my team at work, to the fact that without driving far, and paying a lot,  pizza can be in your belly AND you'll be able to sleep at night knowing it was attained the way it's supposed to be....by paying for it :)"}
{"text":"I had heard about the \"create your own pizza\" revolution that is sweeping the U.S, yet I had not tried it until Fired Pie.  I totally understand the revolution now.  My hubby and I didn't know what to expect when we walked into Fired Pie, because this location was another failed pizza joint before Fired Pie moved in.  We decided to split a steak and blue salad, and we created our own pizza.  I love the variety of toppings and the fact that you can load that baby up with toppings as much as you want and you don't pay any extra!  We got cappricola ham on our pizza which isn't readily available most places.  They also serve Bellini's, which the cashier let me have a taste of to make sure I liked it.  It tasted a bit like a lightly peach flavored slushy champagne.  Very good.  I also love that they have fresh squeezed lemonade.  We ordered a Pizza cookie for dessert, which was delicious, but small.  I wanted it all for myself!  Next time, we are ordering two!  No sharing for me!"}
{"text":"Best brick oven pizza! Hands down! I love how they make your pizza in front of you. Most all, I love that the crust is light, thin and crispy. Their pizza isn't soggy or greasy."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place! They have a lot of competition in the area and might be in a somewhat hidden location, but apparently the word is out because they are always packed! Don't let long lines fool you as they are very fast at making your favorite pizza or salad. The pizza is delicious - fresh as it comes with the perfect crust. The price is not that bad either, especially for the amount of food you get. Pizzas are decent sized and are just under $8. Plus they have a great selection of China Mist iced teas...my favorite! Salads are also fantastic.  I want one opened by my house now...although that could be trouble. The staff has never been anything but great to me so I'm not sure what the bad reviews are about."}
{"text":"Just started at a new job and my new co-workers convinced me to try fired pie. We placed our order right when they opened at 10am and the pizza didn't arrive until noon! To top it off, we ordered 4 pizzas and only got 3! I got to sit and watch my new coworkers enjoy their food while i wished i had ordered from somewhere else.... dont be like me and regret trying them, get your food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Without exaggerating, this is literally the best pizza I have ever had. You pick whatever you want, as much as you want and all for $8. Good size pizzas too. You will not leave here hungry or sad. Awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! What a pie! The chipotle or pizza is such an appropriate description for this place. It starts with a freshly rolled & pressed piece of dough. Then you pick your sauce, cheese & toppings. Off to the oven it goes! Right before your eyes these beautiful pies glisten as it bakes to perfection begging to be devoured! My choice.......The zookeeper special-every piece of meat known to man or at least what's available in their bins, modified of course with a couple garnishments from the garden to church it up. Let me tell you what-The dough is amazing, thin crusted and fire roasted to perfection. With all these toppings it's a masterpiece! I brought the toughest food critics with me and all of them were a static where there choices. Now I just have to find a reason to make it all the way up here unless they can do me a favor and build a location down by us. PLEASE!  Major important update-I just found out they have 9 locations so get your fired pie on!!"}
{"text":"1st time trying this place and last...there was a long dark hair in my son's pizza! Too bad we brought it home or I would have asked to talk to a manager. Please train employees to keep their long hair tied or put it in a hair net this is gross. I literally paid 10 bucks for a piece of hair!"}
{"text":"I came in at an off time when it wasn't very busy and the staff was very nice and walked me through the process of ordering.  Everything was very good, I like that the crust comes out nice and crispy even with lots of toppings on it."}
{"text":"What can I say other that the staff here  rocks.  We went at opening and wasn't busy yet (being in Central Phoenix Lunch is a different story,    First Andrew explained patiently so of the many salads and created our pizza exactly how we asked (btw ask for fresh sliced mozzarella with the precut).     Dennis cooked our pizza with precision  n the brick oven, Tori and Rubi makes our delicious dessert and Brittani rang us up with a great smile.  I also was impressed with the  manager making the atmosphere along with her crew fun and providing an exceptional pizza, salad and dinning experience"}
{"text":"Ordered the half Hawaiian and Meaty Italian. Service was great and delivered very quickly. The 11\" size is perfect for 1 serving and the one price with unlimited toppings is a nice touch. It is pretty much like a pizza place that is done Chipotle style.  At $7.95 it's not bad at all for what you get. My pizza was cooked beautifully and tasted delicious.  One of the only true downsides is it's a thin crust pizza (essentially a pita pizza really). Would be great to have a pan option, but that would probably take much longer to bake."}
{"text":"This place is normally one of my favorite places to eat while shopping. NOT TODAY! The place had been open less than an hour and I went to order and the girl behind the counter spent the whole time talking to her coworkers while putting toppings on my pizza that I didn't ask for. When I told her that she became upset and gave an attitude.  Her coworker jumped and helped out because she was deliberately going extra slow and would ask me slowly what I wanted. When my food finally came it was thrown on the counter but everyone else had their food delivered to their table. I just wanted to get out of there the customer service was so awful. I would've given it a one star but the food was still good."}
{"text":"Love fired pie. However, lots of health issues here. Wasn't happy to see them as I was checking out getting ready to eat. Money placed on papers that pizza rests on. Drink where you have to open with hand in food prep area. Filthy iPad. Person making pizzas with 2-3\" bears no beard guard. Supplies on dirty floor in back room. Not a good look guys."}
{"text":"Fired Pie did not disappoint. The atmosphere was trendy, upbeat and fun. Food is prepared right before you with fresh and plentiful options. I went with the steak & blue cheese pizza which was full of flavor. My husband created his own supreme type pizza. We both liked the sauce and cheese options. The crust is thin but not too crunchy. It was just right. Food was ready quickly and the ordering line moves efficiently."}
{"text":"Miles says four stars means I like it a lot!  \"I like the taste, it tastes like really good pizza...the crust is really thin so you can actually eat it...it's not doughy, it's crispy\".  We'll try a salad next time.  By the way, Miles is nine and my food critic :-)"}
{"text":"Of all the pizza options, fast, made to order, traditional delivery, You name it, this is my 11 yr old kids favorite!  Fast, crispy thin crust and sideways made the same way! I'd give it five stars but i haven't eaten it....so trying to be honest...the kid says four stars so gotta go with it!"}
{"text":"Didn't spread the cheese out only had large blotches on my pizza and almost no sauce. The crust was burned. And only 8 pepperonis on the whole pizza. My first time going here so I was disappointed.    They were kind enough to contact me and apologize I will try their pizza again and update my review."}
{"text":"I always went to Fired Pie on I-17 & 101 shopping center, when this location opened I was thrilled! Unfortunately the first time I tried it, my pizza was borderline burnt. I went back today to give it another try...when I walked in, nobody said hello or acknowledged I was there. Not a single employee smiled or seemed to have any personality. My pizza was yet again, burnt. My two stars are because this place truly have potential to improve, but as of right now, I won't be back anytime soon.  It might be good for this location to take notes from the I-17 & 101 location on customer service and correct pizza cooking."}
{"text":"The food is amazing the owner is a dick. I asked if he takes apple pay bc i just bought stuff next door w it and i like it. He says \"We ah do not take bannana pay or orange pay or whatever this apple pay is\" then he told me that I need to download this app that has a box that is just for his business so i can pay with this wave of the future item that clearly a sales rep sold this dinosaur. I hope this guy goes out of business and kids starve for being such an ass to me (especially bc I get 2pizzas every time I'm in the area which is now down to 0 for life)"}
{"text":"Consistency is so important. Unfortunately, consistency is not an ingredient here. On this visit, the toppings were distributed evenly. The guy on the oven just couldn't leave it alone. The end result, an undercooked crust which wasn't detected until returning home. Where's the quality control?"}
{"text":"Great location and busy at lunch. Saw many locals in here and they seem to be regulars. Just a block from the convention center."}
{"text":"Great food, awful service. I'd never been to this food court location, so I had a previously awesome experience with Fired Pie and had high expectations. We were the first and only ones in line and clearly inconvenienced the staff. A young man impatiently asked what we wanted and saw our group of 5 and annoyingly asked how many pizzas. When we said, \"5,\" he went to grab 5 pizzas, and when we said, \"wait, just 4 please, sorry,\" he looked at his co-worker and rolled his eyes and sighed loudly right in front of us. Apparently they have never inconvenienced anyone in changing their minds. They got very irritated whenever we asked for additional menu items, and never greeted or thanked us. Here's a tip, if you don't like your job, get a different one. Easy as that."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza. I love coming here for lunch. I've been once so far and I wasn't disappointed at all. Sounds like it's on today's lunch agenda. I'll have to post a check-in and update a review. Store was packed and still pretty clean. Good job guys, keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Came in on a weeknight it was not just at all we ordered 2 pizzas and a salad which were both good. I'm more of a saucy pizza person so this pizza was a bit dry for my liking, but it had good flavor overall."}
{"text":"I love that I can choose what I want on my pizza. And the ingredients are fresh and tasty. The crust is nice and thin, and crispy. The staff at this location have always been friendly and accommodating. The Pepsi from their machine is good and not watered down or flat. The pizzas also come out fast, so it's perfect for a quick lunch. And, the salads are really good and you can again, choose what you want on them. What a great concept! (But I've tried another choose your own ingredients pizza place and it wasn't as good) Thank you park central Fired Pie!!"}
{"text":"After a particularly irritating morning, I wrote a WTF flame email to the boss.  Like a good geek, I hit delete instead of send.  My coworkers suggested I leave for a long lunch and get over it.   They suggested Fired Pie.     A carb coma sounded helpful so I headed over.   Was pleasantly surprised to find thin crust pizza with all the toppings you want.   I tried the chicken pesto with some sun dried tomatoes.   Pretty good pizza that I could have shared or saved some, but didn't.    Nice comfort food without the carb coma.   As good as Prozac and I'm still employed."}
{"text":"At 2:40 pm I called in an order for 4 pizzas, one Gluten free. The guy that answered said it would be about a half hour. I showed up at 3:05 to which the guy (who was very busy ) said oh I haven't made them yet that's why I said a half an hour. I let that go and said no big deal we are a little early. Me and my daughter sat down at a booth and waited. At around 3:20 a girl came over and said she would ring us up. She handed me the pizza and I asked which one was gluten free to which she responded \"I have no idea\"  I said well I need to know because it could make my daughter sick to which she said  very rudely \"that's not my problem \" I said not your problem and started opening boxes to which she said that one is gluten free. I said are you sure, how do you know? She said because the paper is bent! I then said ok what is your name, to which she replied \"I'm not going to tell you\" I said ok well I'm sure your manager will know who worked today and she laughed and said \"probably \"  I'm sure I don't need to tell you how serious a gluten allergy is, but the way the employee acted is just as disturbing to me.I will NOT be returning to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great concept, quick service.  This place is great! This was my first experience with a pizza place using the order-at-the-counter concept like this, and I was thoroughly impressed. This particular location is nice and open. You order at the counter and can get pretty much whatever you'd want on your pizza or salad. I got a pizza and a small side salad to go with it.  You order your sauce, meats, veggies, and cheese at the counter. I didn't see anything limiting the number of toppings, but they did seem to be pretty careful about the amount of any particular topping that you get. There is a nice variety of everything, with many options for all of the sauces, meats, veggies, and cheeses. They put it all together in front of you, and then they throw it in the oven. Because the crusts are nice and thin, it only takes a few minutes for the pizzas to cook. We had our pizzas at our table before I even finished my small salad that I had taken back and started eating immediately after paying for the meal.  The pizza itself was great! I had put together a chicken pesto and veggies pizza that I really enjoyed. The thin crust had a great texture to it, and the toppings all had good flavor. Add some crushed red pepper to that, and you've got a great pizza. Because it was cooked fresh, it came out nice and hot, with cheese stretching from the slice to mouth with each bite. I ate the whole pizza and was pretty satisfied with the size.  The salad was tasty as well. It made for a nice starter, and considering the choices you have, it's well-priced. Between the salad and pizza, I was probably a little more full than I normally like, but nothing too uncomfortable.  This is a fantastic option for pizza by yourself or for pizza with choosy people who can't agree on toppings. Pretty darn good, and the price is certainly right."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian, so I usually get the tomato basil pizza, which comes with fresh minced garlic. Two times I have gone in and ordered my pizza, only to be told when I'm paying that they were out of certain ingredients. The first time, it was garlic. The second time, it was tomatoes and basil. News flash: it is NOT a tomato basil pizza if it has neither tomatoes not basil. They need to start ordering larger quantities of specific ingredients. If they do run out of something, the entire staff should be made aware so they can inform the customer when the order is placed, not after the pizza is made.  I did still give three stars because the food is quite good (when they can make it) and it is sooooo convenient."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try after seeing it many times. Wish we had passed. No flavor and it was really like a bland sauce with no flavor topping on a saltine."}
{"text":"I've gone here multiple times and have loved it every time!!! I usually get the gluten-free crust which is a little bit extra, but worth it for the unlimited toppings at no extra charge. I HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone who loves thin crust pizza, and loves lots of toppings!!! P.S. They have AMAZING iced tea! My favorites are the watermelon tea and the jasmine blackberry!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza with lots of ingredients to choose from. My only complaint is that they should clean the pizza oven more often, lots of burnt crud from previous pizzas on the bottom of my pizza."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for dinner. It is an interesting concept that you go through a line to pick out all your toppings (a la Subway) and at the end you have a pizza ready to go in the oven! If you don't want to take the time to pick then they do offer ready options that you can request. In addition they have a build your own salad which is a perfect rounded meal!    I wanted to sit and wait for it to see the process and it does not take long at all! They serve beer and wine so you can get your beverage and sit and people watch!   At the end the crust and toppings were cooked perfectly. I would recommend this place for a different type of pizza experience!"}
{"text":"You're not going to get a better deal! Tasty food here at fired pie Two pies to soft drinks for under $20 and the pizza is very good crispy crust thin with very good toppings service was great go to fired pie"}
{"text":"This place was a welcome surprise. It's tucked away and not easy to see from the road, but it's worth the bit of a scavenger hunt.  The staff greeted us warmly the second we walked in and helped us place our order and held our dessert order until we were ready.  I had the Pesto Chicken pizza and he had the Meaty Italian. Each was ~$8 each and could easily have been shared with a side salad instead of ordering two pizzas. Pizzas here are all made with 11\" crusts.  The fire grill flavor was great! The pizza crust was thin and crispy, but not crunchy or cardboard like at all.  The pesto sauce was excellent and the meat pizza was exactly what you would expect it to be and they were happy to put pepperoni on only one side since I don't love pepperoni and wanted to try his pizza.    We finished it off with the Pookie (pizza cookie - if you've been to BJ's think Pzookie) which had a full side scoop of ice cream for just $3. Delish and cooked only when we asked for it so the cookie part was nice and hot to melt the ice cream.  Overall: A We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They don't hold back on the toppings!! Vegan herb crust is amazing!!! Always great service and friendly staff. We've been coming here since day one and it's awesome to see how it's grown."}
{"text":"If it wouldn't seem so weird, I think I would start a Fired Pie fan club. I came here today at 10:38a (I get hungry early!). They open at 10:30a and my fiancé and I were the only ones there! Yes - no wait! I walk up to the counter and you can customize your pizza or pick one from a list. I decided to customize mine:  Pick your sauce: Tomato Cheese: Mozzarella and Gorgonzola Meats: Pepperoni, Spicy Sausage, and Bacon Vegetables: Mushrooms, Spinach, Artichokes, and Jalapenos  They tell me it will take 3 minutes and voila! Two pizzas with a bunch of freaken toppings came out to be less than $20! What???!  There has to be a catch, right? Like, the food sucks or something...  We sit down and my pizza was delicious!!!! The crust was thin and it was so fresh! I even had to get a to-go box (I still had three slices left). Now, that's value! I am kind of scared to come around during lunch peak hours though. I am sure this place gets packed! I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"The other day I got a huge craving for a big salad (weird, right? Who craves salad? I never do, so this was strange!). And a coworker (who only ever eats salad) recommended Fired Pie right away. I was glad I asked him because my salad was great. I got the fired italian. They have all the toppings laid out behind glass, which tempted me into adding more items to my salad! The person who made my salad had no hesitations when I wanted to swap out and add toppings. By the time I was done, it ended up being a totally different salad! All the veggies and other items were fresh. It hit the spot and satisfied my weird craving for salad! I want to come back and try their pizza now!"}
{"text":"Great pizza good pricing, however the place is the loud, meaning very noisy. You can't talk to your table mate. For take away there is nothing in place aside from standing in line and waiting to get to the cashier.  This seems to apply even if you call in your order."}
{"text":"Uhmm okay we're addicted! FiredPie was some place my son told me about. I come now regularly! Super amazing pizza and I can't eat dairy/cheese and they always clean the utensils and change gloves for me! I feel special! It's like pizza chipotle and it's only $7.99! They also have vegan and gluten free crust and vegan cheese, my nieces are vegan and they abso loved it. So here is a place that accommodates many palettes! Definitely give it a try and oh they don't charge extra for toppings you can literally walk out with a 11inch pizza and a drink for under $10! They can get really busy during peak hours but even then your pizza will be done in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Very good idea! Fired Pie is the perfect mix of Grimaldi's Pizza and Subway! I will continue coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place.. Many ingredients in both veggie and meat section.. Thin crust pizza was really nice.. Reasonable price.. Must visit place.."}
{"text":"I'm not saying this pizza will change your life...but it will. It's fast but has amazing flavor and ingredients. Since eating this pizza, I've been able to hear colors and communicate with animals...not all, but most. I've also notice the weather is perpetually pleasant and I'm suddenly able to slam dunk a basketball. It's gotta be the pizza. Eat it often."}
{"text":"Zack and Kyle were amazing with my son's but allergies. Totally went above and beyond to help us feel safe! Excellent customer service. If you haven't eaten here before- everything is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner before a Suns game.  The hubs and kiddo had a pizza and the other kiddo and myself had a salad.  The pizzas and salads were both very good and extremely reasonably priced.  The salads were big!  The staff was not the friendliest or most helpful.  This is a stand in line and order type of place.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and salad.  The place isn't super clean the staff isn't super friendly but the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"A great experience.  They greeted us upon entering and asked if it was our first time. My hubby couldn't believe that you could request as many toppings as you liked.  They confirmed that you choose any ingredients and they add what you requested.  I'm not a meat eater and they were fine with just putting goodies on half of the pizza.  We also had green salads.  The pizza came quickly as we were eating salad.  The pizza was cooked to perfection.  One pizza was plenty for the two of us.  The pizza crust is nice and thin.  I liked that the pizza is not greasy like your typical slice.  The only weird thing was the seats in the booths were so low, we ended up moving to a table.  Other than that, everything was fine and we'd go back."}
{"text":"We were greeted upon entering and asked if this was our first visit,  This is the Subway of pizzas.  You order whatever sauce, cheese and toppings you want for a standard price.  We had a house salad and a pie.  While we were working on our salad, the pie came out.  Nice thin crust full of our desired ingredients.  We were happy!  The flavors were excellent and the pie was cooked to perfection.  At this price, good service, and great food we'll return for sure."}
{"text":"I heart pizza like seriously bad... and fired pie is my favorite place... the young people that work here are also amazing.."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and above-average pizza, ruined by possibly the rudest owner of an eating establishment I have ever encountered. And his rudeness wasn't even directed at me.  I'll kick this off with the huge negative for this experience. The owner.  As I approached the front of the line and my time to order, he stepped behind the counter and started replacing some food items. He noticed something wrong (not sure what) and proceeded to loudly berate his employee right in front of me and everyone else in line. Following that ouburst, he assumed one of the positions on the line and started putting toppings on pizzas as requested by the customers. One of those customers my friend right behind me. My friend, God-forbid, couldn't hear what the owner was saying to him (and it was our first time there as well), and very loudly, rudely and in a very condescending way repeated himself. It was so awkward and uncomfortable that my friend only got a couple of the toppings he wanted so that he could discontinue the exchange.  Note to the owner: this is not New York City and this is not a soup kitchen and this is not a Seinfeld episode.  You are wound very tight and make what should be a fun/pleasant experience one that isn't. I feel sorry for your employees who have to take your verbal abuse in front of customers.  Your rudeness to my friend was unnecessary.  You are in the wrong business. There are other comments/reviews that also make mention of your rudeness. Your food is pretty good, but certainly not at the expense of such poor service.  Also, your employees were kicking tail behind the counter. They were all friendly, and they were all fast and accurate. I would have quit on the spot right  in your face if you spoke to me like that in front of customers. You could use some training.  As for the food, it was above-average. I had my own creation and enjoyed it.  The salad we got was very good.  Thankfully there are many equally good pizza spots throughout the valley.  I won't be returning here for the reasons stated above."}
{"text":"My brother and I stumbled into this place randomly and it was amazing fresh pizza. They havr so many toppings and truly let you customize to make it your perfect pie. The pizza was amazing and I plan on going back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while trying to decide what to grab to eat before a movie. It was fast but delicious. Not \"fast food\" or greasy. It's like a \"subway\" for fired pizzas, and it's fabulous! You can choose your base/sauce, meat or lack thereof, cheeses, and toppings as you watch them make it!  They also have salads FYI. I chose the steak gorgonzola pizza with a garlic base, roasted peppers, kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella, and grilled onions. It was amazingly delicious. The best part about this is that your pizza is the same price ($8) regardless of the amount of toppings you choose! So have at it!  My friend got a basic caprese type pizza. We both ate our entire pizzas before we headed to our movie. I will return to this establishment again and again! Great idea and location (as everything else nearby requires a \"sit down\" meal or is some type of Asian flavor)."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very thin not a Neapolitan style but they use very thin skins.  I think the price is kind of high they must have killer markup. The pizza took 5 minutes to cook which is way too long considering a regular PH or PJ pizza takes 8 minutes. The bottom was only slightly brown nor browned cheese so the oven must be around 425 or so, they need to crank the over to 575 or higher. The problem running that long is that the center of the pizza was doughy and slimy. This to me is not a good concept, being in the outlet mall they may not survive the off season."}
{"text":"Deliciousness. Personal size pizza pick your toppings, get as much or as little with no extra charge. Staff super friendly & service is quick."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was our first time there and I am not really a pizza fan but this place was easy, quick, delicious and very well priced. Personally made pizzas to order and built how you want it. Less $8/ 11inch personal thin crust pizza... It can't be beat. So many choices for toppings and great service. The website said it was closed on Sunday but it was open. Hopefully that was changed. So definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza joint.  1 personal size very thing crust pizza plus a drink will set you back almost $15 after you add tax.  I made a great pizza and it was delicious....but I ate the whole thing and was still hungry.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good quick customizable pizza place. If you're in a hurry is place is great! Reminds me of a Chipotle but for pizza. Lots of different toppings sauces and cheese selections. Also offers salads"}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas! They come as a personal pizza and I thought it was a good enough size/portion for me. I went with the chicken pesto pizza and I would definitely get it again. My friend had ordered the Hawaiian pizza. You can pick already made pizzas or make your own"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and taste! I love the food here and the price is great for what you are getting.   My one negative is consistency on the ZA can be off and sometimes it needs to be a little more crispy for all the yummy goodness to hold up."}
{"text":"I've had this bookmarked for awhile...I should have come in sooner! It's great!  We came in today for Father's Day (found out about the free pie for Dad's today gave us a perfect reason to check it out).  When we walked up, they were slammed. But it was not a problem! They are really organized and the line moved super fast. I'm actually shocked at how fast our pizzas came out considering it was so crowded when we went today.   The pizza is fantastic! We ordered the pesto chicken, Italian meat lovers, pepperoni/olives/mushrooms, and a plain cheese for the kids. All the pizzas are $7.75 and just a plain cheese and sauce is $6. Great value for an 11in pizza! Oh and a pizza cookie ya know, since it was a special occasion.  Such a great concept and very well executed. I'm totally coming back to try their salads."}
{"text":"I was tasked with catering a group lunch for 12 people with a very small budget. I chose Fired Pie as everyone could order their own personal pizza or salad. I sent the menu out to all, and then collected the orders and emailed them to the general email (info@firedpie.com) and with a short time received a personalized response from Fred at the Raintree Ranch location confirming my order.   When I arrived at the store, the pizzas were just coming out of the oven and were being boxed individually with our names on the boxes (made it SOOO easy for me!). The pizza stayed crispy for my 10 minute drive back to the office and everyone commented on how fresh and delicious the pizzas were.   I will definitely order Fired Pie for a group lunch again. The cost was less than $9 a person and most people had leftovers. YUM!"}
{"text":"While the Pizza is great, and why shouldn't it be you get to choose exactly what you want on it.   The price is reasonable, and the portion is of a size where you feel full, but not stuffed.  The only detractor is the noise, wow its just short of a dance club.   Still all in all its a great place for lunch with my co-workers."}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza that is just OK. My first time here and we ordered pick up. When we got there they forgot the desert cookie we ordered, so we had to wait while they made it. The pizza was burnt and hard. And the cookie was even worse. Bad customer service also, the employees when we walked in were all sitting around a pizza eating. Probably why they forgot our cookie, than rushed and burnt it when they forgot. First and LAST time there. If you want a personal pizza go to BLAZE."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You can basically make your own 11 inch pizza for about 8 dollars. You can anything based on your preferences in meat, cheese, and sauce. You get basically everything with a soda for less than 10 dollars and their food is great too! The place always look clean and everyone is really professional. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch with friends today.  My pizza was so good, made exactly to order by very efficient staff.  Served quickly too.  Loved the thin crust.  Will return and tell friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious! A small personal thin crust pizza made to order for only $8? Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. No one working wanted to be there (I get it) but at least be pleasant. I am used to more topping selections and the pizza wasnt cooked quite long enough. I'll stick with MOD Pizza. Better yet let's bring in Blaze!"}
{"text":"I went there with my daughter for a late lunch.  The staff was very friendly and helped us make an awesome pizza.  We will look forward to coming back soon.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Any pizza you want for around $8. Plenty for an average hungry adult. Toppings are high quality, fresh and scrumptious. I had spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and extra fresh garlic. No problem or charge if you want extra cheese or toppings.  The crust is wonderfully thin but crispy on the edges; the exemplar of a very fine pie IMO and unlike some places, not one spot of the pie was undercooked. Spinach and mushrooms are yummily marinated and spicy sausage was perfect. The fresh garlic adds a surprising, but very welcome bite.  Salads are the same price roughly and are substantially filling. This is no skimpy dinner salad!  The only drawback is that the line can be out the door at lunch; a testament to how good the pies are. I highly recommend going at off times if possible, but go regardless. All other pies I have tried recently cannot stack up for the value."}
{"text":"I dine often at different fired pie restaurants around the valley. I stopped at this location for lunch. I like the build it my way pizzas. Today when I asked for multiple meats on my pizza the very crabby girl running the register told me I could not get any more meat toppings. Apparently it isn't build it my way. It is build it her way. This will be the last time I ever use this location. If they want to limit toppings then they had better advertise that policy. Total disappointment in not getting the pizza I was wanting."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not greasy. Kind of little subway or Chipotle but with pizza. There is one type of crust unless you want to pay for a gluten free crust ($2). It is a thin crust so it cooks fast and you can get on with your lunch. This is one price for pizza build your own, or a creation, or salad with meats (8.29). Nake salad is 6.29."}
{"text":"Wow this a great thin crust pizza! Can make it with any ingredient combo you can think of! (I had pesto,mozzarella, chicken,onion,garlic) Brick oven cooked = crispy deliciousness!! I will definitely be a repeat customer when in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The pizza is good when they listen to the request of the customer. I hate when my pizza is over cooked, burnt and black. I was there last night and I requested it, not burnt and they burnt it again. I don't understand why its so impossible to listen to me."}
{"text":"This is sad , like where's the pizza. I ordered a veggie with no cheese and they gave me a flat bread with a scarce amount of veggies"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is ok for something quick. The concept is similar to Chipotle. You pick your crust, sauce, and toppings as you walk down the line. It is cooked and brought out to you quickly. The issue is, the crust is soggy. There should be a good crunch and there isn't. I am not sure if it is the dough or the sauce, but it is really disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Create your own pizza or salad for like $8 with unlimited toppings? You won't find that elsewhere. Crust is thin but pizzas are big and perfect size! I love creating different flavors. I also love their steak salad. I went once not craving pizza so I tried a salad, not expecting anything great and I was blown away it was so good and chuck full of steak and veggies with a sweet balsamic that was to dieeeeee for. I will be back for the salad most definitely!!!! We love this place for a casual quick dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"This Fired Pie is in North Scottsdale, convenient for me to visit while at work. Let me start by saying that these folks are extremely PD friendly and welcoming.  The location is extremely clean. The menu boards are easy to read and understand. The prices are on par with similar restaurants. The toppings are fresh and abundant. The staff is friendly and accommodating. When I chose my table, the owner (I assume) began rotating chairs so that we didn't have any with arms...it's hard to fit in there with a duty belt! What thoughtfulness!   On this, my first, visit, I was immediately welcomed. I was interested that there was not just one, but two gluten-free crust options. I tried the herbed, gluten-free crust, for a veggie pizza with tomato sauce. This pizza was fan-frickin-tastic! It was cooked well, cut thoroughly, and was flavorful. The sauce was not too sweet, not too acidic. Perfect.   When I couldn't finish my pie, I found that to-go boxes were readily available at each waste area. Smart!   I will be back to this location if I'm on a call in the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"First time here while visiting Arizona. The pizza is really great. We all enjoyed it. I'm tempted to go back this evening before I leave to try the pesto.."}
{"text":"For a \"Pizza Connoisseur\" this place is great! I love they have signature pizzas and you can custom build your own! Ingredients are fresh and they cook it in a wood fire stove. Always tastes superb!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first time here.  Had all five of our grown kids.  Everyone loved the pizza!  Thin crust, build your own.  Asesomeness!"}
{"text":"Cool spot! Chipotle meets the Personal Pizza. Choose from one of theirs, or design your own and move down the line like Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick build your own pizza.  They have Daiya cheeze to boot!  It's 9 bucks for a pizza, and you can add what you want."}
{"text":"Fired pie nailed the personal pizza, everyone gets what the want and they aren't skimpy on the toppings! Every time we come in we're greeted reasonably fast and friendly service. We'll continue coming back for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Love the thin crust custom made pizza. Quick and helpful service. Will definitely keep visiting."}
{"text":"So, this place is like a Subway or Chipotle of the pizza world.  You get to customize your pizza from the ground up.  Pick a sauce (pesto, marinara, alfredo, buffalo), pick your cheeses (mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, feta, blue cheese, etc.), pick your meats (pepperoni, meatball, Italian sausage, spicy sausage, and bacon, just to name a few).  Then, pick your veggie toppings.  I had sun-dried tomatoes, sauteed spinach, garlic, sauteed mushrooms, and artichoke hearts).  You can get any and all of the toppings you want or you can get one of the pizzas on the menu.  Regardless of which pizza you get or how many toppings you add, it's the same price...$7.95.  Not only was my pizza amazing because I created it, the toppings are high-quality and the thin crust is amazing!  Great food, great prices, and great concept!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good salads, good price. But the staff? Common!!!!  We had a dinner on a saturday night. The line was out the door. There are 10 pizzas made and ready to be put in the oven, and the oven is half full, and the only girl that is putting pizzas in an out of oven is wondering around, doing her thing, taking her sweet time talking to coworkers. I paid for pizza and am staring at her to maker her realize that she can throw my pizzas in and then talk while they are being baked. And sure enough when they were ready, they were just sitting on the side of the oven, with the edge of the pizza getting almost burnt, and im waiting standing for over a minute or two to see when is she going to finally take them out of oven. Such dumb and unprofessional actions almost ruined my mood and my saturday night dinner. Definitely need a better training...."}
{"text":"I generally like this pizza restaurant concept but this location and brand leave much to be desired.  Customer service was indifferent towards the customers.  The restaurant lacked a variety of ingredients and the ones they did have appeared to be far from fresh.  It wasn't busy but took about 20 mins to get our pies because apparently the person that was supposed to bring them out didn't see us and sat them on the back counter until we said something.   So instead of fresh pizza he just handed us the old cold ones.  Flavor was bland anyway so I don't think getting it sooner would have helped.   You can tell the quality of the staff and the ownership's commitment to training and quality is poor.  The staff preferred to lean on the counters and tables talking and texting instead of cleaning.  At least 5 staff members stood by and watched customers attempt to throw away garbage in the over flowing trash can and they just laughed about how full it was.  This restaurant is typical of a brand that is attempting a quick expansion, sacrificing quality and service for cheap labor and ingredients.  I would love to have said a local brand like this was better than outside concept restaurants like Pizza Studio, but I cannot at this time."}
{"text":"This is the best Fired Pie restaurant in AZ!!! I have been to most of them, while all do great with delicious pizzas and service, this one surpasses them all!! Chad the manager is always here and offers the best service and friendliest smile and demeanor!!! He and his staff really go above and beyond. I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is! We come at least 1 or twice a week. They are the best!!!! 5 stars hands down!!"}
{"text":"Depending on whose putting on toppings and who watching the bake. This is the best  pie house I have been to in a long time. The only problem is inconsistent cooked quality.  The taste is superb. The crust is fresh and just the right thickness. Salads are to die for too.  Toppings are cut consistently and bake through just right. Kudos to the product. Superb"}
{"text":"Whenever I've been out drinking late and wake up lacking the ability to function, I always love ordering this place from UberEats.   Unlimited toppings on their pizzas mean you can make some pretty crazy creations (you CAN but be careful, I've made many that were almost inedible lol). I always order 3 pizzas, one heavy on their wonderful selection of veggies, one heavy in tasty meats, and then a final braver one using their other sauce options.   I should mention that even their salads have unlimited toppings so you can be as health conscious or unconscious as you want!   Definitely worth trying out if you're trying to satisfy a picky eater or someone who never knows what they want. Their pizzas are a bit on the small size but their ingredients are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great affordable pizzas and salads. Order off the menu or create your own. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza style restaurant. Basically a chipotle but with pizza! Located in nice plaza with many places to eat and watch a movie. The staff and service was nice and professional. At the start of the line you choose your crust and sauces, from the red sauce, pesto to garlic oil they all look great. Then the meat...pepperonis, chicken, salami, spicy sausage and more, you can even opt to get all of it if you'd like! Fresh veggies and other topping at the end. My pizza came out very tasty and just how I'd want it. Only thing about this visit is they burnt the pizza crust just a bit, but still very good! Overall great place, great employees, very clean and very quick! Worth a visit to build your own pizza."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre pizza with low quality ingredients.  If you are a pizza aficionado, go somewhere else.  Grimaldi's is much better.  I will not come back here.  I brought my family (6).  We ordered 4 of their tiny personal pizzas (there only choice is a personal pizza) and 2 salads.  It was $75.  At any other pizza place, i would have spent $30 less.    In short; this place is expensive low quality pizza.  Go to grimaldis."}
{"text":"I'm a thin crust fanatic, and this place delivered!  Best pizza I've had in a very long time - AND $7.95 for unlimited toppings. This includes meat and cheese.  If you love pizza you must run, not walk to FiredPie!"}
{"text":"I held off writing a review the first time because I thought the staff may have been having a bad day. Apparently, they always have a bad day. The young man and lady that helped me could not have been less friendly. There was no greeting at any point. While I deliberated what toppings to put on our pizzas,  the blonde girl heavily sighed as if I was further ruining her likely miserable life.  As I sat watching my food cook, it was nice to see the staff laugh and smile, but too bad it came only while interacting with each other.  Then when our food was finally ready, another young man basically slid our 3 boxes towards me and said nothing other than asking my name to confirm it was our order.  No \"thank you\", \"see you later\", or any other pleasantry. I highly recommend you drive a few miles down the way and go to MOD Pizza. The staff there is always friendly and willing to recommend toppings and combinations. Also, their food tastes better."}
{"text":"Not bad! Fired Pie is a great place to pick up an individual pizza for a snack or a quick lunch.  Unlike other pizza places, you get only one size, which is the 11 inch pizza, but just don't expect any thin crust, stuffed crust, or deep dish varieties.  Instead, you do have a variety of sauces and cheeses to choose from (in addition to toppings).  Rather than use a conventional pizza oven, the pizzas here are baked in an oven with a flame (hence the name Fired Pie).  It doesn't take long to wait either. Our pizza was probably out in 5 minutes.  Most likely this is because of the added efficiency of having only one pizza size to choose from."}
{"text":"When the weekly walking event, \"Meet Me Downtown, Phoenix\" moved it's location from Cityscape to The Park, my friends and I were disappointed with the food selection and prices.  Looking nearby-they nearly share a patio-we found Fired Pie. The pizza is delicious, it takes only minutes to cook. And the staff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and loved it. The portions on the salad are generous and there are numerous choices for pies. I ordered the spicy southwest salad and the meaty italian and had enough for leftovers. I will be bringing my family to this place when they visit."}
{"text":"Very nice place with good tasting pizza. Love the mix and match style of flavors.  Good eats"}
{"text":"The girls in there today made an awesome pizza. I get it and all the toppings had fallen off. I show it to them and she admits that it fell over and she gave it to me anyways. I asked for a refund and she only refunds the pizza. Not the tip or the drink because I had already made the drink. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They make you a custom, thin-crust, 11-inch pizza with whatever you want on it for about $8 If you don't mind thin crust...this is you're place!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee this place!!! It is soooo darn good!!! If u love great pizza and friendly people you will love it here!!!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  Gluten-free tomatoe basil was so good. I was tempted to eat the whole thing!! Fast and friendly service was a bonus! I would def recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Been there twice and had the steak n blue pizza. Absolutely delicious!! Great dough with big air bubbles, cooked well done. Incredible flavor! The price point is good as well......actually  10 bucks + cheaper than Grimaldis for 2 pizzas and 1 drink."}
{"text":"Great lunch place.  For just $7.95, you can order either a build your own pizza or salad. Portions  are quite generous and delicious.  Definitely a place to go over and over again. This location gets pretty busy during the week at lunchtime but the staff is fairly efficient and can get your food done quickly.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited town from Arkansas and were tired & starving and it was late the night we arrived. We made a last minute decision to eat somewhere close to our hotel and chose this place. I ate the Meaty Italian and he ate the Steak & Blue.  Then we shared a chocolate chip party pookie. We both LOVED our pizzas.  The crusts were thin and crispy, SO good and not too heavy (as far as pizza goes).  The party pookie was okay.  It wasn't as sweet as we expected, though the ice cream on top helped with that.   The service was terrific and I would recommend this pizza place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!!! This place makes GRIMALDI'S taste like KROGER brand frozen pizza!!! For $7.95, build your own pizza that's ready in 5 minutes!!! And the crust wasn't soggy in the middle either. Cooked perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, and I have to say that it was an awesome experience! You get to custom make your pizza, and there are many options to choose from! You can get as many toppings or sauces as you would like! Then, they bake the pizza right away, and it's done within 5 minutes max. The staff was nice and patient while we picked out our ingredients.   The pizza was delicious! It was so fresh and yummy. My pizza had chicken, pineapple, spinach and garlic. All of my favorites.   My only complaint is that there isn't enough sauce. My boyfriend asked for extra sauce, but they said they weren't able to put that much because it won't be cooked. Not sure how that works, but I guess that's fine."}
{"text":"Drove from 33rd Avenue during lunch to this location. I knew I wanted either Fired Pie or Jimmy Johns  (freaky fast), as I had limited time. I decided on Fired Pie, when I walked in it was great. Literally no one else in front of me. I walked right up and immediately ordered my pie. I was a little bummed as the shift manager making my pizza was a little stingy with the mushrooms but oh well I have noticed this place has gotten stingy with their meats and veggies lately. I paid and pie was placed into oven. For some reason the shift manager decided to hold a staff meeting right then and there directly in front of the oven. As she talked to 8 or 9 employees for over 10 min. Again in front of the oven, I watched my pizza burn. It wasn't until I made eye contact with an employee and made an annoyed face did they turn around to look at my pizza. The manager had them start another one immediately and continued to talk as if it was no bother to her. When the pizza was done, no apology or anything. My pizza was put in the oven at 2:06pm and I didn't get out of there until 2:23pm. Again, there were no customers ahead of me. I like Fired Pie, it's why I don't mind driving so far to get it on a limited time lunch break. But I think I will pass on this location for now on."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said!? It's DELICIOUS. very very impressive pizza!! I went overboard, I will admit that. I got so excited about all the choices and I ended up putting too many on my pie. Still, it came out PERFECTLY and it was still crisp enough under all that crap to pickup a slice and it didn't fall apart!  My kid and husband went with the standard pepperoni and it was just perfect. The flavors of the sauce and crust are perfect. That's half of what makes a good pizza good.  Great job guys!! Keep it up we'll be back"}
{"text":"Locked my keys in my car, had to wait for road side assistance to break into my car, figured I'd try this place while I waited. SO Yummy!!! I got the margarita pizza and added sliced tomatoes and basil, cooked perfectly and endless topping options. As busy as it was, the service was very quick! The overall quality and freshness of the ingredients was very apparent! Kinda makes me want to get locked out more often! Wouldn't be good for my waist line tho."}
{"text":"I have to say this place was really clean but reminded me to much of BLAZE PIZZA.  Don't get me wrong the pizza was good & the staff was friendly but I was mislead thinking I was going to get a wood fired pizza but instead the restaurant stayed true to the name and my pizza was gas fired. I hate to lower their rating but I was bored by the food. You could at least slice up some fresh jalapenos. You would be surprised how much better the pizza would be."}
{"text":"What's up?  We come here all the time. I've never had to ask for more meat. 5 pieces is all you're trying to give me?  Last time here possibly, especially after the lady mopping almost mopped me.   Was it maybe just one off?  Trying to recover from your Pi day specials?  My company has a lot of employees here at Park Central.  I forgot to add. The manager or owner was in ear shot of the ordering. Clueless."}
{"text":"An amazingly good change up from the usual pizza places. Great amount of variations and combinations for a great price. This is the kind of place that should expand."}
{"text":"Delicious. Our new favorite place. 7.95 for 11 inch pizza, unlimited toppings,6 slices. Fresh ingredients  l, quiet atmosphere, great location downtown."}
{"text":"Have been in numerous times and the pizzas and salads are excellent. Service is quick even when they are busy."}
{"text":"AWFUL service! Order a pizza about 20 minutes ahead of time. When I walked in, despite there being only one other customer and three employees behind the counter, no one ever helped me. I even waived at one, and he just looked at me and then turned around. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I like the space -- very industrial looking. Pizza was cooked really fast. I mean, wicked fast!  We had a pizza with basil and tomatoes, and asked for grilled chicken topping. No extra charge for the toppings, which was a pleasant surprise.  The folks behind the counter were efficient and friendly.   Pizza crust was thin and slightly crispy, nearly perfect. The toppings were definitely fresh and very flavorful. The sauce was robust and slightly zesty without the cloying sweetness you find at other pizza joints.  The only criticism I had with it was that the toppings weren't that hot. I think next time I go, I'll ask for it to spend an extra minute or two in the oven to get the toppings hot and super melty.  Also, they don't have paper plates. So if you prefer to eat your pizza off a plate, you can ask for a metal plate, which they have plenty of. But again, paper plate would've been appreciated."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Very good pizza, the dough is amazing and crunchy and tops quality ingredients. Service and people very friendly and price affordable.. What else can you ask?!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Fired Pie since they opened in the Park Central Mall.  After today I can no longer support this business.  I watched one of the owners embarrass one of her customers.  The customer was having a hard time reading her order and asked a the person making her pizza for assistance.  They wouldn't help her.  The owner comes from behind the counter and snatches her order from her and starts reading off the order.  Her behavior was very unprofessional.  This customer was doing you a favor by supporting your business."}
{"text":"Was searching for quick place to eat in downtown while visiting Phoenix from KC and came across this place on yelp. Loved the vegetarian pizza and added extra toppings on it. Lemonade was refreshing. Service was quick and the food was delicious and affordable. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"While out cycling we stopped at this Fired Pie, we'd never had eaten there before so we thought it'd be a great quick carb snack and back on the road. They had an outside eating area in the shade and they were kind enough to allow us to pull our bikes in beside our table since there werent any bike parking in the entire shopping center.  The staff was very friendly and very helpful, the place was nice and clean inside and out; the food was off the chain; Loved it. We will certainly stop in again."}
{"text":"Really, just average at best. We ordered summer special salad a buffalo chicken salad. Boring!"}
{"text":"The chipotle of pizza!!! You build your own pizza, wait about 10-15 mins and your personal pizza is ready to eat.  I don't know what they put in the crust but the flavor was the best I've ever tasted. I'm simple so I just get basic pepperoni and add lots of cheese and jalapeños. I ate almost the entire pizza to myself so if you are thinking about sharing I would advise to just order your own"}
{"text":"Yum! Great food great price, you can get better! This location was just as good as any other. I love fired pie!"}
{"text":"Like the subway of pizzas but soo good! Make your own pizza and they do it right in front of you. You can get whatever you want and it's super affordable!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out or for a quick lunch. Ordered the southwest salad and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations for a place that is essentially the Chipotle of pizza.  The pie was excellent all around.  I loved the crust, they use quality toppings, and it was cooked just right.  Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"If you like thin crispy brick oven pizza, you will like this place. Plus you get to choose as many toppings as you want!"}
{"text":"This is the best make your own pizza place! This is always my first choice when we are in town. I have never been disappointed and the pizzas are always perfect and cooked to perfection. The service is fantastic! Would totally recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I love this place because I am a vegetarian and I have lots of options to personalize my pizza!  Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars because many times the oven is not cleaned often and burned corn meal or  pizza crust from pervious pizza gets burned and sticks on your pizza! Otherwise, if you love pizza (and salad) this place is great at a decent price!"}
{"text":"I'm a first timer here and I am completely in love already! Not with just the food but with the staff too! The crew that's working on Wednesday night around 7:30 is just simply amazing and make me want to come back even more and its very rare that happens! The pizza is amazing and they weren't stingy with the toppings. $9.00 for pure goodness? I'll take it! Thank you fired pie crew for welcoming me! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was one of the local chains that I tried when I visited the Phoenix area. One would have to be living under a rock to not know that wood-fired is the new thing! There are several popping up around America, and Fired Pie is one of them. However, the experience there was nothing like any other, in a positive way.   Basically, you can mash it up any way you want. They do offer a wide range of choices, sorted by categories such as cheese, meat, veggies, etc. They make it right in front of you, kind of like assembly line-style. Then it gets baked and voila! Check it out sometime."}
{"text":"Amazing. They amount of options and you get are great. Similar to Subway in that fashion. All of the ingredients taste and appear to be fresh. Honestly, if you love pizza you will love this place. If you like pizza you will love this place. If you hate pizza then you are dead to me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in based on the good reviews found on yelp and we were not disappointed.   The ingredients are good quality and the service was friendly and quick.   One of my companions was vegan and he had multiple menu options.   We all left happily full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This is pretty easily the best of the recent trend of make your own pizza for a flat price due to the fact that they do cook in a real pizza oven. I would still always choose a real pizza place above one of these though. Great for a quick lunch or for those who don't agree about toppings."}
{"text":"So here we go... The price is right folks especially for the family and the food is good. On that note I give it a four star. But fellas and even you confident ladies out there. Are you lookin for a pie that is frikin good and delicious that fills u up this aint the place. It is the pizza version of subway. Its in and out no ambience. It's brilliant money wise on that note I give it a five star. I will not go out of my way for this pie but if convenient I would. If your looking for atmosphere, hearty pie and some wings this isn't the place.... Good fast lean pie that has the right price then it is..."}
{"text":"The concept behind Fired Pie is great - completely customized, individual pizzas. When we first got there the line was long but it moved fast. I made my pizza with garlic and oil, meatballs, cheese, spinach and artichokes. It didn't take too long for them to bring it out either. The flavor was good and the pizza was cooked well. It got kinda messy on my hands though - all the cornmeal and ash from the fireplace made for a sloppy eating experience. Maybe a fork and knife would be better for this kind of pizza?   Also, the place itself is very loud - especially when every table is full. It was too hot to sit outside but when it's nice out that's what I will do next time if it's as busy."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for 3 days straight now, food is amazing with unlimited creation combinations. Not only is the food worth driving across town for, but the staff is extremely nice with a manager who is very orientated with pleasing his customers. By far best pizza in AZ!"}
{"text":"When you go out to eat pizza, especially great pizza from Fired Pie, what do you associate with pizza? Is it Chicago, New York, or maybe the Leaning Tower of Pisa and Italy? No! What you are really think is, \"I love being a turtle!!!\", right!? Ok maybe not so much but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are pretty awesome. They are turtles. They know ninjutsu. And they love pizza! So the next time you sit down to eat some pizza, you can reflect on some of these Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-isms. The Turtle-isms are like your fortunes which are deep in the pizza. Just as the pizza pie are like the delicious fortune cookies that contain the fortunes .  Turtle-isms: -Oh, and I want no anchovies. And I mean, no anchovies. You put anchovies on this thing and you're in big trouble, okay?! -Wise men say, 'forgiveness is divine, but never pay full price for late pizza -I have always liked Cowabunga! -Mikey is funny. Funny makes you drop your panties. (Megan Fox said this) -Always carry a long spoon just in case (Master Joyce W.) -Never drink black water that cost $2. It's over price among other things (Master Brett B.) (Ok the last 2 have nothing to do with Turtles lol)"}
{"text":"You have to love custom made to order pizzas.  Whatever your heart desires you get!   The pizza was 5 stars. Our pizza and salad were both very flavorful.  Everything else was pretty sub par. The line moves quickly which is good.   A majority of the staff was friendly!  It seemed like they had a lot of staff on hand but a lot of them seemed to be ineffcient The place was pretty dirty also, crumbs and debris all over the place, it was very of putting There was also a hair in the lemon container  There were no forks available.  We waited about 10 minutes after getting our salad to get a fork.  We were the only ones waiting either.   This place has a ton a potential once they work out the kinks.    I think part of the problem was there seemed to be a lack of leadership or management present.  With the right manager there this place would be a well oiled machine cash cow.   Speaking of cash.  The value for food paid was outrageous.  I was surprised to get soo much food for such little money."}
{"text":"Sometimes a place gets better. This pizza restaurant was given another try by me this week and I was very pleased. It used to be Pizza Me or something like that.  It's $9.17 tax incl for a you name ingredients pie. The crust was nice and thin and you can tell them to pile on the sauce, cheese, meats, and veggies as you like. It came out really fast.  A hungry person could easily eat a whole pie. I had half and they had takeout boxes available at the counter without asking.  Too many pizza places are too doughy (similar to COSTCO food court). Fired Pie doesn't make me feel like I ate a loaf of French bread with sauce and cheese.   Note to anchovy lovers: they'll put them on till you say \"Stop!\""}
{"text":"A little pricey, but it's good food and salads. Our kids enjoyed it and as did wel."}
{"text":"First, let me start out by saying that the customer service was awful!! I went in tuesday afternoon on my lunch break, as i walked in it was packed as usual. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, i was greeted by a short blonde girl with glasses. I began to tell her what sauce and cheese I wanted on my pizza and was rudely interrupted with \"Yeah uh huh, ok\" before finishing my sentence, in return she messed up my order, and when i told her that i wanted Garlic and oil with pesto, not tomato she began to bargain me and say \"I can just put the pesto on top, its fine\" I then responded with \"Well, i just wanted pesto and garlic, not tomato.\" She then sighed, rolled her eyes, and threw the pizza away, turned around and grabbed another one. Already surprised with my rude encounter i continued down the line. When i reached the register a woman (i am assuming the Manager, because she was wearing a collared shirt) asked for my name and was very short and treated me like i was an inconvenience to her, and overcharged me. She charged me for a gluten free pizza which is an additional 2 dollars, i ignored the charge, because i didn't want deal with her again. My name was called, so i went to grab my pizza, i opened the box to confirm my order, and my pizza was burnt! Mind you, i only have a 30 minute lunch. At this point i was severely annoyed, and took my pizza and left, and plan on never coming back!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, and I am a big fan of Mod Pizza.  This is just as good.  Pros: Lots of meat choices, Lots of cheese choices.  Definitely will come back!  Staff was friendly and pretty quick.  We came around 1pm so after the lunch rush, and there wasn't really a line.  Bringing all my coworkers next week!"}
{"text":"An interesting location, nestled in the corner of the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. I am pleased to say that this location rocks !!    The X factor: The sheer consistency and density of the pizza is astounding. Freshly pressed dough combines with oozing textures of mozzarella cheese; combined to create a scrumptiously soft but crispy texture. Each bite feels like a huge blast of marinara garlic Buffalo melded juices that hug each orher and coincide upon chew. Each bite is a true flavor blast!   Feels really awesome to know that the Fired Pie quality feels really awesome to know that the Fired Pie quality can still be foundI within the Scottsdale mama. Say farewell to all the old school say farewell to all the old school pizzerias, that would typically charge around $7 for a slice or two. Goodbye Sbarro's and New York style joints, and hello and welcome in the new era of fresh efficiently made Quick-Step quick made to order pizzas Fired Pie.  Their customer service here is excellent, and although they typically have a line, the wait is well worth it.   Pro tip:  Ask for the Garlic on the pizza before getting the marinara.   If you want to go all out: Ask for the Garlic, marinara, AND buffalo sauce. Oooohweeee! It's simply delicious.   \"Fired Pie is Fire\""}
{"text":"The concept here is very similar to Chipotle except with pizzas! The price is very reasonable at 7.99 for a 11\" pie and there are a ton of fresh ingredients/sauces/cheeses to create a pizza to your hearts desire! There's about 5 cheese options, a dozen meats and a dozen vegetables you can include on your pie, and you can include as many or as little as you want! After you choose your ingredients, they throw it in the brick oven and the pizza was ready in about 5-10 min. The line was pretty quick on a Sunday afternoon at 1 and they seemed pretty efficient at getting people through. I'd definitely come back if I'm craving 's thin crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Great concept results in a great product!  You get what you want on your pizza.  Love the thin crust. You walk out not feeling heavy."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and like any other make your own pizza chains.. wish the staff were a lol more friendly in this location though.  If you are vegan or vegetarian don't go.. they don't have separate pizza cutters.. so your pizza could end up with the meat from other pizzas"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients! Tons to choose from! Grapes on your pizza? Actually tasty! Nice quality chicken too. It's like subway, but fresher and pizza-style."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, extremely rude for whatever reason to my Kids and I .....there were flys on their toppings....disgusting!!!! Get it together Fired Pie!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for lunch and dinner. Plain and simple this place offers you the ability to customize your pizza from sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies. Quality ingredients and customizing pizza the way I want makes this place one of my favorites!  Clean and attractive dining area, clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"This was our first and last order from this location.  The pie was burnt on the sides and bottom and tasted that way.  It was a prepaid order so we were stuck with it.  I showed the employee upon pickup and she said they are all made like this.  In a restaurant we would have refused to pay and requested a manager -  not available at this store.  Our recommendation ... pass this location up and order from somewhere you trust and don't prepay."}
{"text":"Fast and casual, perfect weekday lunch spot. Food was excelled but it felt cramped inside. Small patio in the back to eat outside. I had the Hawaiian BBQ but you can really make any pizza you want, all custom."}
{"text":"Really great! Delicious and fresh pizza, low prices, friendly employees, definitely recommend it for good quick pizza!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni and sausage pizza and cheese pizza we ordered were really good. And the owner is very nice. The atmosphere is also nice and just a walk away if staying at the Hampton Inn and Suited nearby."}
{"text":"I love fired pie more than any other place to eat. It is cheap, fast, and delicious! The staff are friendly and the place is clean. They have a great selection of teas as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the best of the build your own pizza franchises. There is only one size pizza and one size salad. Anything you want, one price. Their sauce is better than the others and this location is new and super clean. I love their pizza and would eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Two aspects contribute to my review. The food and the employees. I have gone to multiple locations and have been impressed with the quality of food and under impressed with the way the staff has treated me. Food: I love the variety available to me! I always get the pesto, toppings like pepperoni, chicken, onions, black olives, etc have all been tried. What makes this pizza joint so amazing is the opportunity to create it exactly how you want. I love the fact that it's thin crust, because one, it allows customers to receive their orders quicker (faster cooking time) and two, it's light enough that I don't feel utterly horrible for eating an entire pizza! Now, the customer service seems to be lacking every time I go in. I stand at the front of the line/counter without being greeted. I've watched employees hold entire conversations while ignoring the fact that I am waiting to order, or waiting to continue telling them my toppings. This is a disheartening factor because I often come here on my lunch break and have limited time to order and drive back to work. I do not feel appreciated as a customer and I find it extremely rude to carry on personal conversations and work without a purpose while there are customers waiting."}
{"text":"I love coming here and eat here more often than I would like to admit haha. I like a lot of toppings on my pizzas so I think it is pretty awesome to be able to get whatever my little heart desires on my pizza all for just under $9. I always think I am going to eat just half and save the rest for later, but it is so dang good I almost always end up eating it all in one sitting. I have heard the salads here are also great-- they look really good, but I just can't go to Fired and not order my favorite pizza. The staff here is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Nice staff, good prices, and good food.  The pizzas come out fast, and are enough to feed 2 people (1 person if you're super hungry). I tried both a veggie-based and meat-based. Both were delicious. The crust is thin, but not overly crispy The garlic oil as a base instead of marinara for a veggie pizza was a great choice. If you want spinach, I would put it on top of the sauce and under the cheese   They also have salads, but the pizza is so good that I'm not sure I plan on trying one!"}
{"text":"Love! I'm enjoying this trend of Chipotle-like places popping up. The main thing about Fired Pie is that the crust is GOOD. I am picky about pizza crust, and theirs is exactly what I look for: thin and slightly crispy with decent bite. With a great foundation, you can make a pizza to your specifications, and it's such a great deal! I love trying combinations involving pesto sauce, chicken, and whatever veggies I fancy that day. Only complaint is they are only open until 4pm on Sundays, boo."}
{"text":"Took my kids to get some pizza. And with all the talk about this place thought I would try it out. From the time I ordered till I left I felt the customer service was poor and the staff untrained. I asked the team member  to just put the toppings of what came on it. It was apparent she did not know what came on any of the preselected pizzas, since I ordered 3 different pizzas. Once they called my number another member waited till I finally situated the 3 pizzas almost dropping one before offering to help. The food itself was very good and we finished most of it there. My 3 year old saw one of the girls folding boxes at the counter and wanted to get some for the leftovers. I walked to the counter with him and politely asked the girl for two boxes. I then got a sarcastic response of we have the boxes over there, which was off in a corner behind the soda area not convenient so spot. But the look in my 3 yr olds face as we turned back to her with 10 prepared boxes on the counter was priceless. I just looked back at the stack she made and received 2 of the boxes on the counter with her literally rolling her eyes at me. Not the family dinner I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Friendly Fast FiredPie.  I am always pleased. This is the perfect sized Pizza for lunch or dinner for one - actually probably one slice too big.  So good - piping hot with lots of cheese and delicious marinara (they have pesto too) pick the ingredients that you like - they fire you inspire! These places are popping up all over because it's good quality food!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and they have VEGAN cheese! It tasted so good, and they have all the veggie options you could dream of. Overall all the workers were nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"First off, bad restaurant name.  When I see the sign, \"Fired Pie\", I think it says, \"Fried Pie\", which, in less you're at the state fair makes no sense.   Second, food is all about flavor, and because the sauce at Fired Pie has no flavor it kills the whole pizza (just like MOD Pizza).   It's a good deal: I walked by a guy eating a pizza that was so loaded with toppings there's no way they made any money on this guy; I guess it evens itself out.   Rarely am I able to point in the direction of someone doing the exact same thing better but in this case Fired Pie executives should eat a pizza at Pizza Sudio. It's the same pizza, same deal, only with flavor.   Looks are important but in food, but not as much as flavor.   Fried Pie, indeed."}
{"text":"This place JUST had a MAJOR health code violation in May.  I am currently getting over FOOD POISONING from this restaurant (3 days of it)!  My wife called and reported it to the store, but the manager wasn't available, we were told that they would definitely be in touch with us the next day.  We have heard ZERO from them!!!  All the health code stuff you can look up for yourself....place is horrible."}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients for pizza and salads, and \"build your own\" is a great option!  Food: I knew I wanted salad, but all the choices were so difficult! I ended up doing a \"build your own with a mix of field greens and spinach, then topped with buffalo chicken, gorgonzola, tomatoes, and pepperoncinis. I ordered ranch dressing, which was served on the side.  Everything I had was fresh and good. The buffalo chicken was tender and spicy, the tomatoes were firm, and the gorgonzola was, well, cheesy! And they didn't mind my request for a bit more cheese.  My only negative is that they don't make the salad in a big bowl so they can \"toss\" the ingredients. Some other places do that, and it's a nice touch.  Cost: $7.95 + tax for this wonderful to-go salad was quite reasonable.  Service:  They were crowded, and based on some of the other reviews, I was worried it might take a long time to get my order. Not so! The line went quickly, and the staff were friendly and helpful.  Atmosphere: Not bad. They have a mix of indoor and outdoor seating.  Overall: I love that I can build my own custom salad (or pizza!) with such a wide range of ingredients. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of creating my own pie. Hint: tell them to bake the pie for 2 extra minutes. The crust will be crispy with no soggy areas. The price is right and service is quick.Give it a try."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Pizza Nut. I Love pizza. I can eat a $5 and A Chris Bianco Pie in the same day and be happy. So it's Friday Night and I have to find dinner and I do Not eat meat on Fridays.  Heard about the build your own Pizzas and was skeptical.  Let me tell you. veggies were fresh dough was thin and crispy. Just what I was looking for. Can't wait to go back and try their meat offerings.  Will bring family next time."}
{"text":"I know these pizza factories are new to Arizona, but they have had them in California for a long time. I have visited probably at least 5 different pizza factories in Los Angeles. I have been to Fired Pie twice so far. One time I got a Tomato Basil pizza and the other time a Cheese Pizza.   Given my past experiences with pizza factories, I can say that the pizza here tastes off. I think the problem is the dough which has a wet and soggy look and texture. It could be an indication that it is frozen dough. Additionally, I don't like how they put basil on the pizza after it has been cooked. They should soak the basil in water in those containers and put it on the pizza before it is cooked, so it gets cooked into the pizza - it tastes way better that way. And actually they don't season the pizza at all before it is being cooked. No salt, pepper, oregeno, nothing - they make you put that on after it is cooked. And it doesn't taste the same.  There is a lot of disorganization behind the counter. They start making your pizza but forget whose pizza is whose toward the end of the line - happened on both occasions, and I almost ended up with the wrong pizza the first time. And it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Yum!! We first discovered this place as one of the only food options in the Chandler outlet mall and decided to try it. Well we all loved it! We then asked about a location by us and this is the place. We have been in 3 times in the past month. The pesto pizza is amazing and the Italian salad is hugggge! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Started off my year here woo hoo !!!!! This is me being somewhat sarcastic but actually a lot more satisfied than I expected to be.  We were just trying to find a place to eat at during Sunday brunch time that wasn't too busy and we settled upon this place.  It's basically the same concept as Pieology, a make your own bar full of pizza toppings.  You can choose from the menu of pre-made pizzas or create your own pizza from the many toppings they have.  I really don't know how to differentiate this place from the bigger pizza chains like Pieology and Blaze Pizza, because honestly, they're basically the same thing.  I will admit that I did enjoy the pre-made pesto pizza they listed on the menu.  It had a pesto base (no tomato sauce) topped with mozzarella cheese and chicken and tomatoes amongst other things.  I like this compared to the Pieology pesto pizza because from what I remember, the pesto is an after topping but is pretty liquidy and not as garlicky as the pesto pizza from Fired Pie."}
{"text":"First time here with the family. Absolutely delicious, we literally just looked for somewhere to sit and our food was ready."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Your own custom personal pizza in minutes!  Loved the crust, loved the selection of toppings and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie just opened today.  Chock full of happy friendly employees on their first day of work. As they describe it...and it basically is...a pizza/salad version of Chipotle.  $7.75 gets you a pizza loaded with (literally) as many toppings as you want.  They have 6 types of cheese, 6 types of sauce, 10 meats, 14 veggies, and fresh herbs to choose from.  You go down the line and pick what you want and they load up your pizza in front of you. The pizza crust is super thin, and my pizza was in and out of the oven (and on my table) in under 3 minutes.  There was no line when I got there so I have no idea how quick you'll get your pizza if there's a crowd.  I came at lunch, and there were 3 other patrons there at the time. Seems like a pretty user friendly way to pick up a quick custom pie if that is what you are looking for.  My total lunch with a drink came to over ten bucks, so it's not an everyday budget lunch type of place. They also offer custom salads for the same $7.75. As far as the pizza goes, all of the ingredients were super fresh (well...it is opening day) and the pizza tasted great.  If you are a fan of thin crust, then this place might be for you.  The crust cooks up to a nice crisp, but not too crisp texture.  I'd characterize the tomato sauce on the sweet side, not spicy at all, so I'll definitely wnt to spice it up with some spices next time. The first visit is probably a little bit overwhelming with all of the choices, and I wonder if this place might suffer from the same problem that Chipotle does, when it gets crowded, it's basically a single-file production line that can bog down if someone in line has a big order or is indecisive.   I had performance anxiety and basically ordered my typical stand by for pizza, most exotic thing I got on it was buffalo chicken.  Next time I'll be more adventurous."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I went with my husband last Saturday for the first time and the pizza was better then I expected!  The place is clean and staff is friendly. And it was done super quick. Great price too."}
{"text":"First visit! I arrived at 12:15 and the line was so long, but I really wanted to try it and I was already there so I stuck it out. Thankfully, the line moves pretty fast! They make your order in waves: first the crust (reg or gluten-free), cheese and sauce, meats, and then vegetables and herbs. It went quickly and it only needs a few minutes in the oven to bake. I got tomato sauce, mozzarella, and red onions, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, jalapeños, artichokes and spinach. I do wish it was fresh spinach instead of cooked. It was delicious! Thin, crispy crust and the rest was soft. I'm excited for my leftovers. The salads looked really good and they even have a pookie (pizza cookie) dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie was the first MYO pizza place I visited in AZ. I went to the location at Park Central years ago and remember enjoying it. I'm glad to see this spot close to home and we came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Lots of good eats in this shopping center and there's plenty of parking as well. I love he concept of making your own (MYO) pizza, especially when toppings are unlimited. I got a standard crust with red sauce and topped it with shredded mozzarella, artichokes, black olives, kalamata olives, jalapeños, mushrooms, spinach, red onions and dried basil on top. We took our pizzas to go and mine was a bit watery from one of the toppings maybe but otherwise it was tasty and I had leftovers. It's a lot of pizza for an affordable price so it's worth it. Plus you get 7% cash back through Yelp which always helps."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great people. :-)  I've tried several places with the same concept and love this one by far...  Their pizza and sauces seem to have much more flavor than other places."}
{"text":"For thin crust pizza at it's finest, be sure to head here to Pizza Me! being that it is so close to my office, we've eaten lunch from there twice now and it's been great each time. I loved the classic margherita pizza and will prob have that be my go to for now. Others tried pizzas with meat on them and the sausage is actually really yummy too, so highly recommend that as a topping! Thanks for being a great price, and a great take out option! Only giving this 4 stars because I have never experienced the actual restaurant, service, or tried anything other than 2 personal pizzas from there so maybe if I try more, it will earn it's 5th star!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! How did I miss this place. For $8 I get anything and everything I could want on a pie. It is a \"Subway\" or Chipotle\" style line. Go through and customize your 11\" pie just like you want it. Then it is fire baked and ready in minutes. Add a beer or a salad for extra yum! It is the best. Nothing but good, fresh, quality ingredients and the best toppings such as artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, fire roasted peppers. You name it! Don't miss it. It is my new go-to for pizza"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and great Salad too. We always stop by when in the area. We are from Maricopa and sometimes we travel all the way there to get our fix.  They have a great product and reasonable prices. customer service is great and they always seem to have so many people there working.  I hope they do well and stay for a looong time."}
{"text":"Really loved this place when it opened. The pizza and salads are great.  I've told everyone I know about this place and how it's so clever like a pizza subway.  Now, all of a sudden,  there are so many rules. Can't have chicken on a small salad, can only have so much cheese, only 8 pieces of pepperoni triangles... WTH??? I think my weekly trips have just ended!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is the Chipotle of the pizza world. I love the concept of this place because I'm picky and I modify my order 99% of the time I dine out. They offer fresh, fast pizza and salads. The BF and I ordered pizzas, of course. You start out with customizing everything from the sauce to the toppings -- a variety of meats, cheeses, veggies, herbs. They also offer alcohol as well as serve yourself fountain drinks (woohoo!) You can even grab your own to-go boxes which is very convenient. Not having someone wait on you is great for those who are lunching and need to get back to work promptly. The staff took our empty pizza trays when we were done.   Mine needed more sauce (I don't eat cheese, so more sauce is needed) and it was a bit burnt, but it was still good pizza. The BF enjoyed it a lot and we will definitely go back. and most of all it's reasonably priced. There are a lot of pizza places that will charge you for the pizza and then per individual topping, which can get pricey. This is all the toppings you could want for $7.75.   I read someone's review on here that says they've never burnt her pizza, so maybe it was a one time thing. Next time I'll ask for more sauce :)"}
{"text":"As a huge pizza fan, I love the ability to customize my own pizza without having to pay for each individual topping. When I found Pieology in California I was in heaven, and this place basically bumped it up one notch of celestiality (which is a word I just made up right now.   The pizza here is so good and so affordable at 8 measly bones for a serious mouthgasm. You will not be sorry about eating here."}
{"text":"So there is this amazing pizza place called Pizza Press outside of Disneyland. It is one of my must haves when I visit.   Imagine my joy when I walked into Fired Pie with the same concept and deliciousness but without the almost 400 mile drive!  The toppings are fresh and choices are plentiful so even the picky eater can find something. The reg tomato pizza sauce isnt spicy and it isn't sweet ( if I want sweet I will buy dessert!!). The only thing is to tell them is to not over cook the pizza cuz it can easily get charred.   If you arent a pizza person or need more than just pizza, the salads aren't to be missed. I ordered just a plain ceasar salad and it was awesome!  The lettuce was crisp and fresh. They didn't overpower it with either cheese or dressing. It wasn't premade and dumped in a bowl or packaging to just serve up. Another plus is that it is definitely big enough to share if you are with someone and you are each having a pizza.  All said and done, this is a place that I hope stays in the neighborhood for years to come!"}
{"text":"The lines are long but there are fast. New manager really has them kicking butt. They seem to be more effective and efficient"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 10 people, and it took a long time to get food to us, as expected. However, it was nice that they brought it out as it was prepared, instead of waiting for the whole order to be ready. The pizza was amazing; I especially loved all of the combinations."}
{"text":"I have eaten here through a variety of methods including Uber Eats (bad experience and was a pain in the ass to fix), fiancée picking it up for us (sometimes after Uber eats screwed it up), and walked there and picked it up for myself. The pizza is good, as some of the other yelpers have said, it's like ordering through a Subway line for sandwiches which is cool but I think somewhat diminishes the final products value. I recently got the meaty Italian pizza and my fiancee got the pesto pizza. After receiving pizza from here as delivery and now watching the process, I was definitely disappointed in the price vs pizza. Our biggest gripe has honestly been the customer service, as it has left us down on multiple fronts. Our apartment, which is very close to this location, has numerous advertisements offering a 10 percent discount at this particular location of Fired Pie. I asked about it today and was told \"we can't do it, but it's not our fault.\" Well cool, is it my fault for asking about an advertisement that your business does? This and the inconveniences from our Uber eats orders really makes it our last choice when it comes to pizza in this area."}
{"text":"I used UberEATS for this one. So I can't tell you what this place is like from the inside, all I can speak about is the food.   I ordered their veggie pizza and I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was thin, crispy, and delicious. The ingredients are great and you can tell the mushrooms were not from a can. I think if you use mushrooms from a can, your pizza will be junk. Luckily, the veggies were fresh which added to the flair of the pizza. My son ordered the pepperoni pizza and he said it was delicious as well. We will be ordering from here again soon and most likely stopping by to have a dine-in experience."}
{"text":"I love the salads.  I do agree with another person on here that they move extremely slow.  My sons pizza were a little overcooked and are not really a fan of this establishment because of the overcooked pizza, but my salad was awesome! I love that I can put whatever toppings I want and do not have to stick to the menu.  Do think they need to improve their drinks area...one machine that does not have many options. The line sometimes gets backed up pretty significant."}
{"text":"My daughter and I really wanted Grimaldi's but didn't want to drive that far (or spend that much).  We thought we would give this a try hoping it would be a good compromise.  We both ordered the tomato basil and I added spinach while my daughter added bacon and pepperoni.     Everyone working was very nice and pleasant but they didn't quite seem to have the best system figured out yet.  The guy putting the sauce and cheese on didn't tell the next guy what I ordered so the basil was skipped on both our pizzas.  No big deal, I will just pay more attention next time.  The first guy I ordered with noticed it after they cooked and offered to fix it but I insisted it wasn't a big deal.  I appreciated the fact he said something (most people probably wouldn't say anything).  Now for the pizza.... OMG this was really really good!  And I mean really good!  The ingredients tasted really fresh and the pizza was a really good size.  Without a doubt we will be back and I will be telling friends and co-workers about it."}
{"text":"I enjoy their pizza. The store, not so much. It's very loud, and a lot of their seating backs right up to the people in line. Some people will stare at you eating, others try to look at your phone. And it is loud. Bare concrete everywhere. However, the thing that really bothers me is that the employees touch everything with their hands. Can you say cross contamination? Hands go from crust to cheese to meat to veggies -- even the wet veggies like the mushrooms and carmelized onions. I haven't had an issue, but it makes me nervous. Don't try to eat here if you have celiac. They have gluten free crusts, but the cross contamination will ruin it for you."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyable.  Good pizza, fun concept, great value.  You'll pay about $8 for a salad or pizza which is enough to split or not (I didn't).  Don't go overboard and try to cram everything on a pizza unless you're just a fatso.  You'll end up with a soggy crust or grease and shame.  Stick to one of their prearranged pies or create your own with a few ingredients.  That's the fun part.  You can come back here 100 times and never have the same thing twice.    The downside here is that if you want to go at a typical lunch hour you may find yourself standing in line for quite awhile.  I arrived a little after 11a and literally 30 people walked in between 11:05a-11:07a.  I can't imagine how it'd look at noon."}
{"text":"When FRESH meets FIRE there can only be an explosion of FLAVOR#My Hawaiian fired pie was Blazin'! I got CHUNKY tomato sauce, bbq sauce, extra cheeses,    pineapple, Hawaiian ham, sauteed onions, sauteed pepers, garlic, and olive oil! WOW was it flavorful! The thin crust complimented all of the toppings well!  I love the Father's Day special they had on Father's Day! I purchased my pizza, and my dad went with me and he got a free pizza! All dads got free pizzas with a purchase! We loved it! Fire Pie YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Love the thin crust crispy pizzas and the fact we can choose our own toppings - lots to choose from - a variety of cheeses - vegan, meat, gluten free, whatever your style ... & pay only one price! The salads are great too - same thing create your own for one price. Help is friendly and prompt. Great for families - groups - individuals.  Prices are very reasonable. Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome decor, and delicious thin crust pie made just how you want it. They have lots of sauces and toppings so you can't go wrong. It was fast and friendly service, I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have been to Fired Pie twice now and each time it has been delicious. The first time my husband and I came on a Sunday around 8pm. The place was dead - the only people inside were the employees. That was fine by me as we were able to place our to-go order quickly. The second visit was with my husband and my father on a Wednesday at 6:30pm. Again, the place was pretty dead but they actually had a few other customers. (Definitely not packed!)  If you haven't been, the concept is you walk up, tell them if you want a salad or a pizza and then they make it right in front of you. For pizza, they ask what kind of sauce (marinara, pesto, alfredo, garlic/oil), what kind of cheese (mozzarella, feta, blue cheese), and then pick your toppings. They have several different types of meat and vegetables to choose from. My perfect pizza has artichokes, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, Kalamata olives, and garlic. We've tried their sausage and chicken - both are good. I prefer the pesto, but I'd like to try to alfredo sauce. Additionally, we've tried the pizza cookie - which is tiny but delicious. Definitely learned our lesson and will order separate desserts next time. ;)  Overall, I really like the concept. It's fast, customizable, and super quick to get your meal. That pizza is literally done in 5 minutes and cooked to perfection! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool place!  Kind of like a subway but build your own pizza or salad. Thin crust style.  I had a salad with feta, grapes, mixed greens, grilled chicken and a balsamic dressing.  My salad was fresh and plentiful.  My colleagues had pizza and were very satisfied.  Quick fast food style build your own pizza or salad.  I enjoyed this place, great concept."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to get a pie. It's like Chipotle for Pizza and only takes about 5 minutes. You select the sauce, the cheese, the toppings - Everything and there is no limit. Lite or fully loaded and the crust is soooo delicious. I would open a franchise if I could. Need one in Gilbert, AZ (Dana Park ;-)  )"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I love fired pie and their food is delicious and the options are extensive. The service, however, varies by location.   Walked in to this one. Six people working behind the counter. Waited 15 minutes in line. The handful of people in front of us never moved. Ended up walking out.   It's not that hard to put the already made toppings on some crust and cook it for a few minutes.   I'll update when I have a better experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service! \"Unlimited toppings\" shouldn't have their employees saying \"that's all I can put on!\" I only put cheese and a vegetable on! You're saving money on all the meat I am NOT asking for! Even others were asking for more things and they were doing it with an attitude!   They were plain rude. Looked down the entire time and made no eye contact with customers! Even the girl at the register... Took my money and said next! It was a scary experience. The one in downtown is so much better and a whole different experience."}
{"text":"This was not fav. I'm sure the pizza would be nice to someone with a more open pallet but to me it wasn't good.  The pookie was really undersized and miss leading."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and had a great experience. One of the employees made a recommendation on one of his own creations, and it was delicious. He started with garlic and red sauce in the crust and added some bbq sauce, mozzarella, bbq chicken, regular chicken, onions, some peppers and added a little more garlic to top it off. I may have missed a few items that he added, but I highly recommend it.  Overall it was a good experience and great customer service. For quick pizza this place is a good spot."}
{"text":"Best personal pizza I have ever had. \"The Chipotle of Pizza.\" I recommend the Buffalo Chicken and Meaty Italian."}
{"text":"This was a fun experience. The only thing holding me back from giving them 5 stars is that the review we saw said they had craft beers. Bud light is not craft and Stella is an import. But the food was really good and staff was very friendly! We will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I've been there a few times for business lunches and everyone has always been happy. The pizzas are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge). Everything looks and tastes fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same price. Although the line can back up at lunch (much like a Chipotle) since everything is made to order, the pizza is done in 3 minutes after being cooked in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any seatign even when the line is long. I actually think this pizza is better than 90% of pizza I've had elsewhere. To me, it's worthy of 5 starts. I just wish they had one right where I live."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure who's solely responsible for this whole fast casual/build your own pizza obsession. MOD has been around since 2008, but I didn't really start to see duplicate concepts popping up in every strip mall until the last two or three years. Quite frankly, I'm a little freaked out by it.  They're crowded, they're frantic, and I've always compared them to eating inside a cafeteria. Why people are so obsessed with this approach has always kind of baffled me. And while I can't credit Fired Pie as being the first fast casual pizza concept, I do see it as the first that actually seemed to create a buzz here in Phoenix.  Like most fast casual pizza joints, the style of pizza is geared more towards the \"Amercanized\" pizza styles. So yes, Dad can get his BBQ pizza and the kids can still order their traditional pepperoni and cheese. But hey, at least Fired Pie isn't trying to claim that they're serving \"authentic\" Neapolitan pizza - which has become sort of diluted and generic buzzword recently. It's custom-made pizza. You make it the way that you like it. Nothing more and nothing less. And guess what? There's a flat fee, which is perfect for people who like over-piling their pies with as much crap as possible.  I used to say their pizza was average, but after a few repeated visits, I can't find myself giving it anything beyond two stars. I'd compare it to eating a premium-grade frozen pizza, which they might find somewhat insulting. It's not god-awful, but it's that kind of pie where you feel totally bloated upon finishing. No, it's not comparable to any of the acclaimed pizzerias in the city - nor is it really trying to be.     For dessert, we've tried the fired pookie (because pizookie is presumably copyrighted). Mine tasted fine while my girlfriend's had a weird aftertaste. Keep in mind, they're individually-sized ones, so you probably want to order your own rather than splitting it with someone else. I see it as the poor man's pizookie (a la BJ's Brewery).  While I feel that nothing tops the experience of a nice, sit-down wood-fired pizzeria, I can understand why this place has become so successful. It's cheap, it's convenient, and it's customization with total control given to the customer. But it's still fast food - even though I've had to wait an absurd 40 minutes to actually get my pizza during my most recent (and final) visit.  Personally, I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for something superior from nearby Bottega or Fabio on Fire - but that's just me."}
{"text":"Every once in a while you get to be pleasantly surprised by a meal. I went to fired pie expecting a quick lunch cause I was in a hurry. But I expected it to be a pre cooked slice of soggy pizza that I had had at the pizza joint that used to be in the same space. But it was a new place. And a new way of doing pizza for that matter.  And it was good, crispy, hot and freshly made to order exactly how I wanted it. In about the same amount of time as that old greasy reheated slice I had been expecting. And for about the same price too.  Wow.    They actually let you pick the sauce you want. Add the toppings you want and then cook it somehow in about five minutes to perfection.  It kind of reminds me of subway and making a sandwich. But with pizza instead. All for under eight bucks.  I highly recommend this place.  It is a great concept and great food. And it's done quickly by nice people just for you."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin and crispy pizza. The Chipotle of pizzas.  Able to choose from a ton of veggie options. 4 different teas, lemonade, and beer and wine. 1 pizza is enough for one guy meal and I finished 3/4 of mine. Owner was nice and runs a tight ship mentioned he will be opening up more locations soon. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker....I wasn't sure what we were getting ourselves into...but it was amazing.  We got it to go.  It was the envy of everyone at work.  Just a great tasting pizza."}
{"text":"You know I come here a bit too often because we are addicted. Forever delighted when we're here! All the fresh veggies, herbs, dough, will make you wanna slap yo mama. It's that good!"}
{"text":"I came in today because I was in the area and because I heard that the pizzas and salads were $4.15 today for a special tax relief promotion. This restaurant is very clean and the employees were very friendly and welcomed me by name. There is no other place that I would prefer to get my pizzas. I don't know another place in town that lets you get the toppings you want for no extra charge--and the toppings here are quality as well. I'd say their pizzas and salads are enough to share with two people so  I like to bring a friend with me when I get the chance and my friends have always been impressed with the quality of ingredients as well."}
{"text":"So I tried quite a few pizzas in Phoenix last week. Another that stood out for me is Fired Pie's. For a \"quick service\" spot, it's quite good pizza.  I customized mine with pesto, parm & mozz, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms. Yum! It really hit the spot. It didn't take long to come out the oven, yet it still tasted very homemade.  I'm still amazed a pizza that good came with a large cup of (iced) tea for under $12. If you're caught in Downtown PHX & in need of a quick (but still good!) lunch, Fired Pie is a wise choice."}
{"text":"1st time at this place, limited menu but everything is prepared in front of you, got the steak and blue salad, place is small but clean, has outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Pizza's are very light and delicious. Complete pizza can easily be eaten in one portion. They have a wide variety of salads and season specials as well.  I ordered veggie pizza and summer special Apple salad. Will definitely make this my regular spot."}
{"text":"So we had a siblings date today and decided to dine here since we were shopping around the area. and not to mention that this is my first time since I came from Asia. I would say that this is the best place I've ever been so far I actually call it \"make your own pizza fastfood\" because you can actually pick whatever you want to put in your pizza and that's so cool for me. So I would give 5star for this because you guys made my tummy happy. Anddddd nice place and the pizza is perf! Love it!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite build-your-own pizza place! They have two (yes two!) gluten free crust options, and both are amazing!   The topping servings are generous, the staff is friendly and quick and the prices are unbeatable (1 pizza is 2 meals for me).  The salads are also great, and when I come with my fiancé we usually split pizza and a salad for a perfect little dinner.  Expert tip: Have them brush the outer part of the crust with garlic butter, it's amazing once fired."}
{"text":"Perfect thin crust pizza! Great choices for pizzas and salads. Friendly, competent, quick service and wine and beer too! Affordable quality food. Yum!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! (see photos) FAST!!! (cooks in 2 minutes)  LOW COST!!! ($7.95 with 5+ toppings)  This is a make your own pizza place, but unlike Cosmo Kramer's idea on Seinfeld, they work the food and oven.  You just tell them what toppings to add and you watch as they do it 2 feet in front of you.    You can say 'easy on the cheese' or 'more tomato sauce' or 'add more bacon & fresh garlic' and since you watch as it's being done it comes out PERFECT every time.  All pizzas are personal size, the crust is so light and airy that it doesn't feel heavy, gluten free is available too. This is THE perfect lunch-break restaurant; quick cheap and amazing food quality...  I have sent many people here and it's a 100% thumbs up so far. Nothing like a personal FIRED PIE customized to perfection fresh out of the oven.   Try it, tell 'em IKE sent u."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and it was a interesting mix compared to other pizza places. It's set up like a chipotle where you can make your own pizza or order something that is on the menu. Great pizza! It came out really warm and the service was welcoming. There are a few of these around now, go check them out!"}
{"text":"Had a good time. Fresh pizza, made and cooked in front of you in super-fast time. Friendly staff, good atmosphere, and much MUCH cheaper than Dominos. My only grouch is that it's Pepsi on tap instead of Coca Cola, but hey, minor personal taste gripe :)"}
{"text":"I am super happy there is one of these close to home. They have super slow service and that is why I cant give this a 5 stars but they just opened and working out the kinks still so I want to give them so room to grow. The food is still high quality and tastes great! The pizza is super fun to make from all the different combinations that are available. I like being able to watch what is occurring with the building of the pie too! The salads look great as well but I need to check that out next time!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and fast. The kids love it although they weren't very creative with the toppings.  But for the $8, you get to have as many toppings as you want on an 11 in.  Gluten free dough only $2 more!  And they will be opening one in downtown Tucson in the fall. Yes!!!  Salads, same, they have suggested salads or make your own, same price. Great deal and kids can have fun with it. We can have fun with it.  It's all thin crust, what I prefer anyhow. They have 3 different types of Chinamist iced teas, and I like that they have the fountain acai Vitamix here, not into drinking any sodas.   Dessert, the oven baked warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Yum!  The size is really only for 1 person, so we ordered another to share.  Maybe if they had a bigger size of this, it would be perfect.  It reminds me of what they serve at BJ's, just smaller. Would definitely be visiting this in Tucson when they open.  Love the chipotle concept copied to pizza and salads!   :-)"}
{"text":"After seeing a lot of positive reviews on Yelp, I finally had a chance to give this a try. Went in for lunch (right at noon), which I was a little worried about due to the location being new and seeming to have a lot of traffic, and we did have to wait a bit, but it wasn't terrible. What they have going here is simple in concept and execution - exactly the kind of thing I'm a fan of. They make you a custom, thin-crust, 11-inch pizza with whatever you want on it for about $8. The pizza was delicious and filling. There's a decent amount of indoor seating and some outside as well. My only real complaint was a lack of fresh green peppers as a topping (they only offer roasted peppers, which I got, but will not get next time). Both my companion and I were pleased with the food and commented on coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and it was good!  I got the margarita pizza (which is very simple but hard to make it taste great cause its so simple) and the fired Italian salad and my husband built his own.  Service was nice and fast, the ordering system was simple.   The only thing i had issues with is the temp of the store (too cold! Problem we shouldnt have in arizona lol) and that there isnt much for kids. (Toddler age)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for lunch on a Sunday. We were really excited to try a new spot. However, when we got our food, we were disappointed, especially by boyfriend, because he was really craving pizza and did not feel satisfied. The pizza he had gotten was a build-your-own pizza. He was disappointed because there was very little meat on the pizza. They seem to skimp out on the toppings. The only thing good about this place is the price for a personal pizza. We probably will not come back again and we are wondering why this place has four stars. Maybe we are tough critics. Anyway, save your money. There are better pizza places in the east valley such as Pestos, even Grimaldis. Also, Rino D's in Gilbert is really good."}
{"text":"I loved fired pie but  this particular one is dirty, not like a busy Saturday dirty, but moldy toilets dusty, dirty floors, overflowing trash. makes me wonder how dirty behind the scenes are.  May give it another try but I'm dissaponted, for being such a new hip place its not clean."}
{"text":"Pizzas are so good with the crispy flat crust, and I love how you can customize all the toppings and get extra of any topping and they don't charge more. The pizzas cook fast in about 5 minutes. The salads are also really great because they are HUGE and full of tons of goodies. Select from any of the same toppings that go on the pizzas. Their service is very fast and efficient. The prices are a great value. They provide to-go pizza boxes all over the restaurant so you can box up your leftovers without having to ask someone at the front counter for a box."}
{"text":"The spicy Southwest salad was so yummy I giggled all through dinner.   Special kudos for gluten-free crust, so my daughter could enjoy pizza with us!   My husband was chatting and enjoying his pizza and ate almost the whole thing!  We thoroughly enjoyed the customization they allow, and how much you can pick and choose exactly what you want to go on your pizza or salad. Super friendly service, would love to come back here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here so was a little lost with the whole process.  However, staff was so friendly and amazing. Pizza of course was too! Very happy customer."}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended this place and it's within walking distance so a couple friends and I decided to try it out one day. The line was practically out the door which is always a good sign albeit a little frustrating with a limited amount of time for lunch but that's out of their control.   The people working behind the counter were kind of hit and miss. Some of them were very friendly and helpful and some looked as if they would rather be absolutely anywhere other than there. It was a little frustrating especially since it was my first time and I felt like I was bothering them while trying to figure out what my options were and what I wanted.  The pizza itself was great! I love that you can customize everything about it and that it's made to order, not to mention the flavors were great. Plus you can't beat a set price for as many toppings as you want.  All in all I'm gonna keep going back because the good is great but I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that the service gets a little bit friendlier on my next visits."}
{"text":"Best pizza Ive ever had. You can customize and put anything on your pizza. Anything! For the same flat prize. It's amazingly fast too and pretty friendly service."}
{"text":"This place can be good but the fact that they have a no bill higher then 20s that blends in with the rest of the lettering on the outside is bad. Should but red box around or make it bigger. Very disappointed with service to find out after made pizzas could have been a big waste of food. I'd say skipp it go to one of the 2 between 99th and 107th"}
{"text":"New favorite place period... No matter how you make your pizza it will be the best pizza you ever had.  Craving it now ."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good just a little greasy but I got the Chicken Pesto with a drink which came to about $10 and was definently enough for 2! The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because the staff wasn't very welcoming : / but everything else was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I'm telling you this pizza and the whole concept is fantastic this pizza is great with fresh ingredients served quickly and in a fun friendly clean environment"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  We went here for lunch today (5 of us) and each had a fantastic meal!  It's basically Subway for pizza with huge amount of toppings-- veg and meat, even choose your own sauces and cheeses.  Service was friendly and helpful but also left us alone to hang out and visit.  If I only lived closer, I would be here a lot!  Yelpers, you never steer me wrong!  Thanks for a great recommendation!"}
{"text":"This pizza is divine. Cracker thin crust, pick your own toppings or choose from their menu. Fresh ingredients and just enough to choose from. One place where fresh mozzarella is a choice. Quick service."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in for lunch at about 1pm. No one in line just us. It was our 1st time at a Fired Pie and we were hungry and excited. We ordered a pizza, the girl who took our order was lost and confused. We asked her if the herb crust was fresh and made in house. She didn't know even though she got it from underneath somewhere and it was completely frozen. $2 extra for a frozen crust sprinkled with dry herbs? No thanks. We opted for the fresh and carried on with the toppings. We had to read the girls the ingredients that were in their own pizza choices, another bad sign. Then we ordered a salad. Finally we sat down and the buffalo chicken in the salad was gross. It was fatty and seemed boiled. We asked them to remake it sans chicken and it was OK. Standard Caesar salad. Then the pizza arrived, the crust was almost all black. The girl left so much bare crust without toppings it was a disappointment. Also the crust was burnt but the bottom was soggy? I guess these girls don't know how to work the oven. $20 later and we left unsatisfied. I'm hoping its just this new location. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not particularly memorable I guess is my takeaway here.  I had the southwestern chicken salad, which was just not super inspired - it was heavy handed on canned ingredients that I'd personally go light on, like pickled peppers and black olives. It was overpowering.  Maybe some fresh corn in it, or some cilantro or both would have livened it up?  And more importantly this, one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves - the chicken was basically that Tyson pre-cooked sodium brined bagged chicken.  C'mon!  Its the quickest way to ruin anything.    The kids had the pesto chicken pizza.  Same sad chicken on their pizza.  Pesto itself was decent but the Buitoni stuff at the market gets it better if you ask me (I'm fully aware nobody asked :). And the crust....just kind of made me want to yawn.  Not horrible, but my son didn't want to eat it.  My eight year old son didn't want his pizza crust.  That just ain't normal.   Husband had some meaty pizza which was the clear winner here, so maybe that was the way to go?   Cute concept - reviewer who called it a Chipotle-like concept was spot on, but (and I'm seriously not trying to be a horse's a** with a case of the crankies) I'd rather go to an actual Chipotle.  The fajita bowl would be more inspired than the salad here. The chicken would also taste fresh cooked.  Cute place here, super clean, friendly employees - it just can't save the boring food.   I dunno...I saw a majority young professionals on lunch break here eating, and I guess as a quick fresh pizza before heading back to the grind it works.  But there's a Starbucks down the road, and if it were me I'd rather go through the drive through and grab a wrap and a latte.  But I'm pretty basic, so what do I know?  :)"}
{"text":"This was a delightful treat! You order any pizza toppings you want for $7.95. The pizza is enough for two. Can't beat the price! The pizza was delicious and I will be back soon! There are so many creations you could make. The format was similar to a subway or chipolte. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie pizza,  they make it right in front of you.  Only took a few minutes  in the oven, and it was great. Very fresh,  staff was great too. And the place was super clean. Next time I am at the outlets shopping I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I will definitely be back!  I had the chicken pesto and added mushrooms-it was very good and a great price, under $10 for a pizza that will fill you up and is great!  Two thumbs up for this place ."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and affordable. Recommend you split the pie, with someone cause it's huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before a hockey game with a group of 8.  Interesting production line setup.  Great selections of toppings and crusts as well as cheeses.  Service was good and fairly quick.  Pizza was good, but not spectacular.  I'd give the place 4 stars for value and 3 stars for pizza."}
{"text":"Ive only eaten here once and I already think I'm obsessed with this place! Lol. The crust is nice and thin and just how I like it. The quality of the toppings was very good...and I opted for the sauceless route and did the garlic and oil and was not disappointed.  I wanted to get to cookie pizza but was too full...guess I'll have to go back. Darn! ;)"}
{"text":"I went in today for only a Pookie. The service is always fast and great until today. One employee started my order and I advised her I would be right back to give it time to cook. When I returned another employee saw me and took the Pookie out of the oven and packaged it up to go. The thing was BLACK, burnt!! When I said, it looks burnt her words were, \"I like it like that.\" Thats great for her, but I don't like a burnt cookie.   I asked her to remake it and of course she was irritated as this must have been an inconvenience for her seeing as how I was on my 30 minute lunch break and my time was being wasted waiting on a cookie. She packages it up, pushes it on the counter and immediately walks away...   Okay, so I get to my desk and the cookie looks perfect but the middle is completely raw and the exact center is slightly cold. GROSS! Not only do I get terrible service but I can't get what I pay for. Yes it's only $3.00 but its my $3.00. I called to ask for a manager and of course not a manager on duty just a bunch of kids running a place how they see fit.   Girl bye you'll learn the hard that you'll be baking pizzas forever with an attitude like that."}
{"text":"I love this place, but the customer service at this location is awful. I don't understand why it is so hard to just get things how you want. I go to the location downtown and never get any attitude back or have any issues, but at this location they are so busy they don't really care if you're dissatisfied or not.  I just don't get how you can mess up pizza?   The food is good, but I'll avoid this place at all costs because of the rude service I received."}
{"text":"Everything was fine here, but MOD is better. Maybe they just hire better at MOD? The employees here were a little clueless...had to ask them multiple times for two different things.    The crust is a little thin too but I know that's a personal preference."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, and  totally made to order (or pre designed, should you wish it) pizzas that have yet to disappoint. Tasty salads, too. You can even get a bottle of brew or glass of wine to go with your food if you're feeling it. The fact that they carry Pepsi is a bonus for me. They also have fresh brewed China Mist ice teas.  As someone else said before, this is the \"Subway\" of pizzas. It's a great idea that's been tastefully executed.   We've been coming in since their opening night and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The owner contacted me after my poor review/experience and offered some free pizza coupons.  I was very impressed with this level of service.  The pizzas were made very well and both pizzas were ready when we picked up.  As always, great product!  More consistency in the service and production areas would make it 5 stars for me, but I will continue to bring my business here as I appreciate the willingness to make it right!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I love Fired Pie, but after today's experience, I think I will be taking my business to MOD Pizza, which is closer to my home. I spent $23 here and was a waste of money. The 2 pizzas we got didn't taste like they normally do. Don't know what it was but the pizzas and the ingredients on the pizza didn't taste good at all, but that was not my big issue. First thing is as I was ordering and giving her my toppings she was not listening at all. I asked for butter garlic sauce and then red tomato sauce, so she puts the garlic butter on and then when she asked me about my cheese I told her mozzarella and she forgot the red tomato sauce and when i said something she got an attitude about it and just took the cheese off put it in a measuring cup put the sauce on and threw that same cheese back on, didn't even bother to start a new pizza. So I let it go, then i ordered a medium iced tea thinking its hot outside i want a refreshing ice tea and come to see there is no sweet and low, no equal, no splenda and no sugar and when I ask them about it once again another attitude and she says whatever is out there is what we have i then said there is nothing out there and she looked at me and said well i guess were out then. I then said well i am not a soda drinker so i can i please get my money back for my drink and she said well sir u already paid for it I then told her yes thinking u guys had what i wanted which u do not so then i said no worries i will just have free water in the cup i paid for and she said nothing. So I get our food and as i'm eating I see the same lady bring out 2 pizzas to another guest and that guest oh we wanted this to go and then she throws an attitude and says so do u want me to remake them and  box them or just pout these in a  2 go box and then the other lady comes out goes near the soda machine and says to the other lady oh this is ridiculous I am no longer cutting lemons for customers anymore they always think this cup we out them in is a trash can. I also noticed that there weren't many people in here at all which is maybe because the restraint was very dirty trash everywhere dirty tables and the trash cans were soo full that we couldn't even throw our trash away and when i brought it to there attention I asked them where would they like me to put my trash the one lady says to me in the trash can where it goes i then told her well if u cleaned and took out ur trash maybe i could and she said nothing back so we left our trash on the tables and left. I will never come back here again. This place has lost my business. I have a Zzeeks Pizza that delivers to my home and I have a MOD Pizza so close to me that I don't even have to leave my neighborhood and this place is 3 miles away from me which i drove out of y way to go to. I will take my business else where for now on."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had, and only 7.75 for a \"11 with all the toppings you want?!"}
{"text":"Great food! If you're ever craving some pizza and need some options... this is the place to be! I've been hear a few times, but I actually tried their salad today and they are just as good! Many options for everyone."}
{"text":"We don't order. We call ahead, ONLY GO IF ZACK(H) IS WORKING, and tell him the same three word order everytime, \"I trust you.\" He proceeds to handcraft one of his dozens of culinary masterpieces, typically including at least 20 perfectly married ingredients, and each and every time our minds are blown. Again.. WE ONLY GO IF ZACK IS WORKING. If he is.. tell him the Rajas sent you for his secret menu, then lay back and let your taste buds curl."}
{"text":"First time visit. Suuuuper close to work and wanted a good pizza. The staff was super friendly and helpful. My order got mixed up (because I didn't really know what I ordered) but they fixed it!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fired pie is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Arizona. After shopping at the outlets this place serves devious custom made pizza. Hot and fresh. They also have great customer service and make sure you have everything you want on you pizza and bring it right out to the table for you. If you are ever near by check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner, great concept & everyone can get their own toppings. Crust is thin & pizza taste great, we got 2 pizzas & drinks (refills free) for $21 & some change. Ingredients are fresh & they are super quick!"}
{"text":"Crispy crust personal pizza made just how you want it.    The salads are also made to order.    Great prices and delicious."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of make-ur-own pizza places but this was a great stop while in town! Young workers were super nice and pizza was good! Sauce on the pizza was incredible, defenitly recommend for a quick late night bite!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Awesome restaurant to have in a food court. We were there near closing time and the two employees were really helpful and positive. My friend ordered the gluten free crust (with the garlic seasoning which she said was great) and he offered to change his gloves because he had touched the regular dough with them. Really considerate! Great pizza, great service :) and really fast for made to order fresh pizza!"}
{"text":"Reviewing the Chandler location. Awesome customer service from staff! Clean store  and short wait times!! In and out within 15mins :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love fired pie. It has the same Concept as subway or chipotle where you can choose toppings & sauces!! Out of all the locations I've been to Ray Rd location is my fave. I think just because of the location- totally recommend this place.. Oh also recommend cilantro on your pizza which is put on at the end after your pizza has cooked which is the best!! Mmm!!"}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle for pizza! If you're a fan of thin crust, this a super yummy, reasonably priced place. My pizza was about $7, which is two meals for me. My coworker and I were also able to go in, order, and eat, with plenty of time to spare during out lunch hour. So worth the calories."}
{"text":"The beauty of Fired Pie is the ability to make your pizza as fatty as possible. I've been to Project Pie in Vegas and it's very similar.  The sauce selection is nice and there are lots and lots of toppings choices. and the price! Let me tell you... poor girl's dream. Its definitely affordable.  Why not a five star? Man, Project Pie stole my heart in the beginning and I can't cheat on my first love.   Over all it was : a solid pizza place... I'd be a regular. Four stars!"}
{"text":"This is in the same complex as Starbucks and Jamba Juice and is a little hard to find at first. The location is a little strange but as more businesses move in, I'm sure the atmosphere will perk up. Great portions for the price-- $7.75 for any salad or pizza ($2 extra for gluten free crust). The regular crust was the best I remember having locally, and the pizza was baked off in no time. I shared a blue cheese and steak pizza as well as the Italian salad. The salad was underwhelming (although huge) and the pizza delicious. I recommend splitting... One pizza is fairly large! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"7.95 for an 11 inch thin crust pizza, with unlimited toppings. Got half steak and blue, half Hawaii bbq. Both were delicious.  Pizza was ready in 3 minutes. I will be returning. Probably soon enough that they won't have noticed I was gone."}
{"text":"Great place that is fast, clean and great value for the money!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and got the two slices and drink special.  The pepperoni slice was so yummy and fresh.  The crust was doughy and just the right temperature.  The staff is always friendly and go out of their way to make sure we have a good time when ordering.    Great place to go when time is short and i am in the mood for a quick slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Finally me a pizza that I really love! Cross between fast food and casual dinning.  I am eating the BBQ pizza and it is so yummy. The bbq sauce is crammelized.  I love the fact freon order to eating only took 9 ninutes and the staff were very friendly and understood me.  This one is a winner and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to Fired Pie for the first time and let me tell you, I'm disappointed I hadn't been there sooner. I went in tonight with my family and had a great experience. Elias and Jenny, if I remember their names correctly, made our pizzas & recommended a pookie. I'm so glad they did because it is the best dessert EVER! Everything was great and I loved the vibe. I definitely would recommend anyone go there and I for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The pizza is awesome.  You pick the toppings that you want and the crust is thin, so they are done quickly.  It's clean, friendly and the food is wonderful.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and, overall, I'm a fan. They do a good job getting the pizza out quickly but at the right temperature (smart that they use thin crust only). They make sure to know in advance what you're going to put on the pizza so they don't overload it. Price is good.  I do agree with some of the reviews, though, that their system for keeping track of everything needs work. I've only been here when there aren't many people, but I can't imagine that having the cashier write down everything on your pizza as you order it is the best way to go.  As an aside, when I was here I overheard the owner/manager talking with someone who seemed like a regular. At one point one of them commented: \"This is pretty smart. If you don't like your pizza, you only have yourself to blame.\" I have to say that I kind of agree."}
{"text":"A decent place for a quick pizza for about $11.  The only downside is the location, which shares parking with far too many other stores and restaurants.  The tiny parking lot barely fits 30 cars.  Unfortunately today was screaming little bastard day and I had to eat and run to get away from the little human air raid sirens."}
{"text":"Pizza was absolutely fabulous and the mixed green salad  with the sweet balsamic vinaigrette completed the meal perfectly. Cleanliness and friendliness of the staff was a plus. Great for take out or eat in. It's your choice and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fast friendly service. The customer interaction could be polished a tad.   I like that you can watch them make your pizza and they use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Place has potentially gone down a bit in quality? Hoping today is a case of inexperience. Pizzas we're a tad underdone, they weren't charging the correct amount for the pizzas and didn't know how to make them.  Toppings were lighter then normal, cheese and toppings only lightly cooked and the oven wasn't cleaned recently.  Bottom of pizzas covered in black seasoning. Hopeful next time more toppings like normal, pizza cooked longer and they know to charge appropriately."}
{"text":"Fired Pie 4905 E. Ray Road Ahwatukee, 85044  The Fired Pie is the most unusual pizza shop I have ever been to. The make individual 11 inch custom pizza's for the crazy price of $7.95.  You have your choice of any or all of 30 different ingredients ranging from 13 different meats ( including anchovies ), 6 different cheeses including fresh mozzarella, 6 sauces, 14 veggies including sun dried tomatoes, and even custom made salads for those not eating pizza.  Our group of 10 were there for dinner, and were totally surprised by the menu items. Usually, when you order pizza, you get a few ingredients and then pay extra for any more. One member of our party decided to really put them to the test and ordered a pizza with every ingredient except anchovies. Pizzas are ready in about 10 minutes and are baked right in front of you. His pizza was almost 2 inches thick with toppings, so they really mean what they say about putting on the ingredients you want.  I had looked on their web site previously and had a paper with me on which I previously wrote down the ingredients that I wanted. I was not disappointed in the least. I should point out that all pizzas are thin crust, but considering the amount of toppings, I was glad not to have all the bread to eat.   Everyone agreed that this was perhaps one of the best values for money available anywhere. They have ten locations including one in Tucson. Drinks are self-serve and they do have wine available.   They only serve one dessert. A fresh baked cookie in the pan topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream slowly melting over it.  The place has both indoor and outdoor seating so you can sit wherever you are most comfortable. Of note is that while we were there, a steady stream of customers were lined up ordering pizza with the line and one point going out the door.  While this is not gourmet pizza, it is tasty and easy on the pocket. Cleanliness was apparent with tables being cleaned as soon as people finished.  5 stars for good food and outstanding value"}
{"text":"Unlike most places, this place is NOT stingy on the toppings! Love that! I got a salad, made just the way I like it, and it did not disappoint. I'm a big meat eater and I hate when places are stingy on the meat! Plenty of choices for the non meat eaters as well :)   Staff was very friendly and prices are great! The only downside would be the location. It was kind of hard to find."}
{"text":"If you want some bomb pizza with a kick ass staff i highly recommend this location. Every single one of the employees are beyond kind. Always clean and easy going environment"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the concept and execution.  Fast good pizza made within minutes - awesome. Unlimited toppings for the same price - awesome. Actual taste - solid. Value - solid, under 8 bucks (sans tax)  I was good for a good many hours after I ate the pizza and I eat a lot. I'm at the Tanger outlets enough and it'll probably be my go to until I get tired of it :)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot where they have a menu with predesigned pizzas but also give you the option to build your own pizza and they can turn it around quick."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was FANTASTIC. Pizza was made pretty quickly- the light crust makes it cook quickly in the oven. Crust was light, chewy, and one of the best I've ever had. I ordered the pesto chicken pizza and was able to customize that by adding artichokes, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes (at no extra charge). I'm definitely planning on coming back. Kudos to the owner and staff!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I really used to like Fired Pie...that is until today.  Walked in to order my pizza, took a few minutes to be waited on (I was the only one in line).  Once the girl came over to me she was very nice, got down to the veggies and I was passed off to another person who was just okay.  Then I got to the cashier (small girl -two side knots as a hair-do)  she was very rude not only to me but to others as I watched and waited for my pizza.  People who ordered after me got their pizza before me, once I got my pizza she gave to me as 'Dine In' even thought I told her at check out that it was to go.  I reminded her that it was a To Go order, she took it back from me boxed it up and tossed it to me across the counter.  Not once did she smile, apologize or anything.  Fired Pie raised their prices - I would be willing to pay these prices if the service was good.  You can have the best food around, but if the service sucks people will not go back.  I will start going to Blaze just down the street."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place, but today, not so much. Maybe it's the new kids not knowing how to make pizza or just lazy employees bit my pizza was not what I expect from Fired Pie.  First off...I had a two inch crust that should have been filed with sauce and toppings. Then the topping were pretty much just dumped on and not areas around, including the garlic which made for a few crappy bites. I think I'll drive the extra few miles to hit up the other place on Ray and the 101."}
{"text":"Went to fired pie yesterday  the food was good and the place was clean however the people waiting on me were rude I was going to give this fired pie 3 stars until Matt and his amazing customer service came to help me. He really knows customer service I am talking white glove treatment I could of sworn I was at Disney land for a second matt's customer service was that good. Anyways 5 stars will come again I just hope Matt is working"}
{"text":"Great place for a fast food pizza! I ordered meaty Italian with unlimited veggie toppings! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the worst time here I placed a call over the phone to pick up my food since I was in a hurry and they told me it would take 15 min to be ready which was how far away I was...  they confirmed my order about three times over the phone but when I got there my order was still not ready and they gave it to me about 30 min after when I received it there was still ingredients missing so I asked for them to fix it which they grabbed my pizza threw it back in the line thru the ingredients that were missing in the pizza stuck it in the over for another minute or two and put it back in the box and handed it to me while trying to eat the pizza all the ingredients were falling off of it since they weren't incorporated with the cheese or anything.  It was just horrible and to top it off I was late to my meeting because they did not have my order ready to begin with.  Horrible horrible service if I could I would just give this a 0star rating."}
{"text":"If I could give this location no starts I would. We had someone in our office attempt to call in a lunch order which we do often and were denied. We were told that went place orders past a certain time. We called back to speak to a manger Mike who answered the phone said he was the manager (and so unprofessional) . I asked why we couldn't place an order he stated that it's lunch time and they were busy. Well that's odd the whole point of us order was for lunch. Good to know we can't order lunch at lunch and that you would want to loose out on that business."}
{"text":"Salads are limited in pre-determined menu options but very good and generous - service is average - can be long lines at lunch but any other time should be pretty decent wait times"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Sooo yummy! Toppings always seem to be fresh and top quality. Most workers will accommodate gluten free requests by changing gloves and attempting to not cross-contaminate for allergies. Service has been hit or miss sometimes but all in all a consistent go-to for cheat day pizza!   Fyi, they will always burn your bread on the gluten free crust for some reason. I tend to like that little burn around the edges. But if you don't,  you might want to make a special request."}
{"text":"I can make any pizza I want?  Yes, please.  I swear these guys stole this idea from Kramer, who wanted to open a restaurant where people could make their own pie, but whatever, I'm not complaining.  It actually works.  I was trying to think of a reason why Fired Pie shouldn't receive 5-stars, but I couldn't come up with anything.  The process is relatively quick and painless and your pizza is ready within a few minutes.  For about $8.50 (with tax), this pizza is awesome.  In fact, the quality and taste is almost equal to popular establishments like Pomo Pizzeria, Cibo, and Federal Pizza.  I absolutely love the fact that I can design whatever pizza I want and add extra toppings for no additional fee.  If you want a quick, affordable, delicious experience, I highly recommend Fired Pie to sate your hunger for pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious, build your own pizza bar. The pizza costs the same if you get no toppings as it would if you got every topping. They make it right in front of you. My only complaint is it took forever! Never go here during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place is super quick.  You can order the pizza with just what you want on it.  Love the crust, thin and crispy.  The only thing I would change is the drink area for soda, it is cramped and not efficient to use.  This place is great.  Would recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"The first time I had fired pie the pizza was delicious,  and every since then I am not impressed.  This location was not organized a total mess, none of the staff was communicating, boxes all over the place, dirty tables, and the pizza gave me an upset stomach.   so disappointed.   I have to day I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in during my lunch hour today. Service was very fast and the girl that made the salad and pizza was very friendly.  Me and my dad shared a margherita pizza and the size was perfect. The ingredients were all fresh and best of all it was done within ten minutes! Oh and best of all was the price! $20 for two people for great food is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Love that this is made to order & fast. It looks like quality ingredients and the pizza was delicious! Staff was friendly! Cute, clean, and nearby my home. Totally a winner!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  The price is amazing it's close to home! They have beer and wine for those that like that with your pizza!!! This will be my go to pizza place!!"}
{"text":"We are never coming back. The manager has no place managing anything and does not know one thing about customer service.  We were offered a chance to make a charitable donation and receive free pookies. The manager schooled the employee in front of us and did not offer to give us the same deal. He did not even acknowledge me standing one foot in front of them! In addition, the staff is young and has no idea how to deliver your order. I answered the same questions about my order repeatedly. I almost went behind the counter to finish it myself! Adios, Fired Pie I would give this zero stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in  tonight to get a pizza and salad. Everything was delicious. The line went quick and customer service was great. I was most impressed with Chad who is the manager. I see him just going above and beyond any customer service I've experienced before ...I had to ask him if he is the owner ! He was exceptional and I will definitely come back!! What a great experience we had ! Thank you Chad for your amazing work ethic."}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza and they refused to take my order because  they closed in 30 mins Bad customer service"}
{"text":"If you like thin crust  pizza then fired pizza is for you, pretty good pizza no wings;/  it can get pretty packed."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprise to see decent reviews for this location.. I love the Deer Valley location but I have never experienced or even heard of such bad customer service as I did at the Tanger one. It was no where near close and every person in there couldn't not have acted like they wanted us there any less. Blonde girl making our pizzas was SO rude and worked at literally a snail's pace. She barely said a word other than \"what do you want?\". She then slid the pizzas over to the register where obviously nobody was and walked away, and then her along with 5 or 6 other employees proceeded to watch us stand there and stare at them while we waited to be rang up. Right then, and also when I went back up to ask for a side of sauce, they looked at me, continued gossiping and whispering for a good minute or so, and then came to \"help\" me with no hint of a smile or conversation. Not to mention, the pizzas were SO overly covered in cheese and toppings that the girl was literally smushing her palms on the pizza to try and flatten it all out. (Not kidding) The end result was overly greasy and heavy for a thin crust pizza and nothing like how it turns out at the other locations. There was maybe 4 tables of 2-3 people each in the whole restaurant, and almost every other table was filthy. It was clear there was no real manager on duty and a bunch of teenagers waiting to get off. I'll stick with Deer Valley from now on!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about pizza, and I believe this is the Best cracker-like thin crust pizza I have ever had. Pizzaria Bianco is great, but I like this better. The pizza is ready in 3-4 minutes. It's not fast food, though, it's gourmet."}
{"text":"Great pizzas with options to build your own. Thin crust isn't my first preference but these are awesome. Salads are also fantastic!  Only drawback in finding this place was through the search for a \"brewery restaurant\". Bottled beer is available but leaves the taste buds longing for a draft craft brew or two."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd say this about Fired Pie... but I think this is the best pizza I have ever had.  Hands down.  Thin crust is my favorite.  Along with fresh ingredients, wonderful flavors and a great price; you can't beat this.  I had a tried a place like this at USC in CA and this destroys that one.  Fired Pie is top notch!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Fired Pie 10 stars.  Unfortunately I cannot.  This place always delivers.  Whichever location I have been to, I have not been disappointed.   I get the same thing every visit and with each visit, I am reminded of why I keep coming back.  The food is so addicting!  Also helps that they serve Pepsi products.  Girlfriend wasn't happy when they moved from Coke to Pepsi.  Ahh well.  Keep opening more of these wonderful establishments and I will visit them all!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie destroys all the 'subway style pizza' places.  They rock!  This is our location and we are never disappoined."}
{"text":"The pizza taste like any other pizza place. Nothing out of the ordinary... just a fire wood pizza place. I like the whole concept of building you own pizza. And it's not too expensive either.   However the staffs here at this locations are extremely rude or untrained or confused. This one girl had her work hat on backwards was helping me out and was yelling super loud at me over the counter. She smacked her mouth and rolled her eyes at my friend and I when we were ordering. This automatically made me dislike the vibe. The cashier didn't know what she was doing and was confused the whole time. The other workers were just standing around clueless. For a normal sized pizza shop, they are over staffed. There were 3 extra people standing around clueless.   Overall. The food is decent. Nothing fab and I could eat again. The service and environment is horrible and the only reason why I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Pizza crust came out too soft to carry the ingredients, it was literally soggy by the time I got to the second slice. The staff looked tired and acted like we were bothering them by being there. Tasted great, but the texture and service puts this place in the so-so category."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! You can get virtually anything you want on a thin crust pizza for 7.99! And it's SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"They recently opened up in the Tanger Outlets at Westgate, and we hadn't tried it...so away we go.  We both ordered individual pies we designed ourselves, which I really like.  While you go through the line, they literally make it in front of you.  I appreciate seeing the ingredients, because that can make or break my decision on what to add.  I went with the tomato sauce, mozzarella & parmesan cheeses, meatballs & steak and garlic & artichoke.  Hubby went with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, meatballs and spinach.  The crust is thin, so it only took a few minutes for them to be ready.  They were really good, too!  The crust was nice and crispy, which we both like.  To drink, hubby went with Sprite and I chose lemonade.  I usually prefer ice tea, but they only had flavored ones, which I do not enjoy.  We were a bit surprised that they only stay open until 9pm on weekends, but whatever.  It's not like the mall closes, it's open-air, we could still enjoy a pie after the stores close.    The pie was so good, I had to give them 4 stars, but if they had better drink options and stayed open later, they may have gotten all 5...oh well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in here a few days ago to see what they replaced Al's with, and we were not disappointed! This place is great! It has a very Subway/Chipolte vibe, with lots of fresh ingredients, and a make it your own philosophy.  We were greeted right away and asked if we had been there before. We said we had not, and they walked us through it all. It was fast, filling, and tasty! I made a BBQ chicken pizza with bacon, and he had a buffalo chicken pizza with bacon. Next time, I think I will try one of the salads!  I love the simplicity of the pricing, and there are no charges for extra cheese, or even adding a second meat. for both of us, drinks included, we paid less than $21.00! That is actually less than a lunch at Subway or Chipolte with some of the add ons.   All in all, a great experience! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered postmates so cannot comment on the building or staff. Pizza was great, I thought the menu was a little basic at first but I was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the steak & blue, a custom pizza, spicy southwest salad and a pookie for two people and did not finish everything in one sitting. Everything was really good; I really don't have anything negative to say. Keep up the good work Fired Pie! Can't wait until we eat there again!"}
{"text":"Had this pizza for lunch and it was amazing.. perfect size and unlimited toppings...Will be coming back for sure!!!! Love fired pie..."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't anything to write home about. Flavor was good just the amount of toppings on the pizza was anemic. (Literally had 1 fragment of Canadian Bacon per slice) Crust was comparable to a Totino's pizza you can get in the freezer section at any grocery store. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a pizza place where you can customize your own personal size pizza and have it ready in just a few minutes. Unfortunately, I found it much more appealing in theory than in practice. Going down the assembly line was very chaotic; since they place was so crowded they were really trying to hustle. The counter for the toppings was kind of a mess and I found it a little unappetizing to watch the plastic gloved hands dipping in and out of all of the bins. There was a lot of cross contamination going on. The meats were also not very appealing since they were mostly ground up into a crumble (presumably so it would heat up faster). I did enjoy the capricola ham but my hubby was pretty disappointed in the unidentifiable meat they referred to as \"steak\". The dining area was equally crowded and messy. There isn't really any organization to the way they have set up the tables and chairs... they are just kind of thrown together in the middle of the room and it is very difficult to maneuver between them. We opted to sit outside but I am sure the booths would be comfy on a day with less people there (not many of those so they were all taken).  The pizza was actually pretty tasty but not good enough that I would go out of my way for it. But if I needed a fast food lunch then I'd choose this over a burger place any day. I would not come again for dinner though... it is definitely not a sit down dinner type of place. I may give them another shot after the new restaurant buzz dies down."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The prices are very good for the quality! Not exactly a nice place to bring a date , but an excellent place to have lunch or grab a bite before a movie. In my opinion this is the best pizza in the north valley."}
{"text":"We tried the order online feature with grubhub. It was not ready when they said it would be but the hubby is very paitent so it didn't phase him much. The fact you can pick anything topping for a flat price is super nice for those of us that like everything on their pizza. Pizza gave me a Californian style vibe with a thinner crust. Topping were delicious and tasted fresh. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Was just ok thought very chintzy with toppings I bought an eight dollar build your own. Asked for green pepper strips on the pizza I had to ask him if he could put a little bit more when he put 3 pieces on top...I got 2 more:("}
{"text":"Excellent! Hard to beat $7.75 for all the toppings you want. Went mid day on a Saturday so not crowded at all and the perfect pie was done in about 5 minutes.   Great concept and friendly staff. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale, for takeout. Not the type of place you'd want to dine in at. Great staff too."}
{"text":"Design your own pizza! For around $8, you can have as many toppings as you want on an 11\" thin crust personal pie. Not bad! The toppings themselves are high quality, and they have quite a few to choose from. Some that I can remember off the top of my head include thinly sliced steak, grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, black olive, capicola, pepperoni, fresh and shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, anchovies, spinach.... you get the point. The possibilities are endless. Sauces are equally as diverse including your basic tomato, pesto, olive oil and garlic, just to name a few!   Due to the endless possibilities for your pizza, a lot of the long lines at the restaurant are due to the time it takes to name off each topping you want for your pizza. I love how the menu online has a bubble selection so you can check off your toppings and sauce as you want. Perhaps it would speed up the process more if each customer were able to check off what they wanted on a printed sheet and hand it off to a staff member?  The pizza itself only took a few minutes to make and in the meantime we were able to find seats easily and get drinks. The fountain beverages are Coke-based, and there is a nice variety of China Mist teas available as well. The watermelon iced tea is one of my favorites!  My pizza had a mix of meats (Chicken and steak) and veggies (Spinach, black olives, sauteed onion, peppers, and mushroom). It tasted great except for one bite which had an overwhelming amount of salt on it. It really did taste like someone had poured a whole spoonful of salt onto this piece. I had to spit it out. The rest of the pizza luckily had a normal amount of salt on it.  Overall I love the concept and I'll be back to try out another custom creation!"}
{"text":"Custom pizza for less than $8! Like other similar custom pizza places, Fired Pie offers unlimited toppings and various sauces for a reasonable price. There is only one size for the pizzas (As opposed to MOD Pizza which has 3 sizes) but they do offer salads and a pizza cookie for dessert. I went with a modified Margherita pizza (Added artichoke). It was on a thin crust dough, and the toppings themselves went well together. I liked how the tomato sauce was more chunky rather than a paste-based sauce, I think it gave the pizza more flavor and texture. The crust itself was a little too hard around the edges which made it hard to eat, but the rest of the pizza had a good crispness.   Fountain drinks are Coke-based and they have a wonderful selection of China Mist teas, including my favorite watermelon marula tea.   Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We originally came here with a LARGE group (about 20) after graduation during lunch hour on a weekday.  Yikes.  This is a build-your-own pizza place that is pretty much like Chipotle for pizzas.  On the wall they have instructions for building your own pizza, or you can select from \"pre-built\" pizzas like tomato and basil (margarita), Hawaiian bbq, meat lovers, etc.  It doesn't really matter whether you select a pre-built one or not because after that you can still put on whatever toppings you want.  They also have a selection of salads that I would like to try too.  My husband and his friends were particularly excited because there is no extra cost for extra toppings.  If you build your own pizza, it's 7.75.  If you select a pre-built pizza, it's 7.75.  Haha.    It was a busy weekday and the line was long, however, once you get through line the food comes out pretty quickly.  I went to get my drink and sit down and by then my pizza was ready.  The pizzas themselves are AMAZING -- one of the best margaritas I have had.  The sauce is savory and the crust is the perfect mixture of not too crunchy and not too soggy.  Add in the fact that the pizzas are basically $8 -- even more amazingness!"}
{"text":"I had to have dessert first. It was all so amazing! Pizza takes 3 minutes to cook. Many options of pizza plus yummy salads. Everything is made fresh.  and right in front of you. I went in and there and was able to order my food right away which was great since I was starving. The pizza was thin crust and delicious. I'm not a thin crust fan but it was so good.  The \"Pookie\" dessert was better than sex. Vanilla bean ice cream on top of a freshly backed cookie.  I also had a soda. All for less than $20!!!  I will be back for more... and soon."}
{"text":"Gluten Free crust available. Custom 11\" pizzas!  Perfect combination of delicious food, excellent service and a comfortable, casual atmosphere.  Must try the Pookie! They have chocolate chip or macadamia nut available. If you are already a fan or plan to share then I recommend the party size."}
{"text":"This pizza is da bomb. So quick but so tasty. Ordered fontina cheese, pepperoni, bacon, jalapeno and of course pineapple, the best pizza topping. It was a thinner crust so it was easy to eat the whole thing by yourself.   Wish they had one of these in Wisco."}
{"text":"Meh... When faced with Fired Pie or the many other new \"build your own pizza\" joints out there, even their \"Pookie\" can't save them. I gave them a fair shot, but the minimal pre cooked and sad looking toppings, tasteless crust, and tiny expensive cookie didn't get high marks in my book. I try and not rate my restaurants by comparing to others, so even as a standalone place... I didn't like the food and won't be back. Customer service was good and the place was clean, so they can have a couple of stars."}
{"text":"This is my new fave pizza!  Make your own to order. Great thin crust.  Huge salads. Staff seem not quite on top of things but got a free beer out of it."}
{"text":"Fire! You are telling me I can put steak on a pizza? Yes please. They have a great concept of building your pie from the sauce up. No extra cost for added toppings makes it a no brainer."}
{"text":"I have been going to fired pie since they opened and they have always had great customer service and speed until last week. I went into find about 5 girls standing behind the counter and 3 only actually working the line. The issue I had is one of the girls not working the line was stocking the veggies and slowing down the girl actually making the pizzas. She kept talking about random things and making the pizza maker go even slower. The customer I. Front of me had 3 pizzas and a salad and only one person actually going the line....ridiculous!!!! Once I got through the line and I turned around there were 7. People behind the counter and only 2 really working. Why have so many employees if none of them are going to help the customers and just stand around. My worst experience there by far"}
{"text":"just finished ordering and the staff was so rude to me. They were upset that I touched the glass and the \"pizza topper applied\" was obviously upset that he makes 7.75 per hour but he is definitely not a case for raising the minimum wage. I have a food allergy and they were so so so rude about it. Beware of bad customer service."}
{"text":"If Grimaldi's or Rosati's got together with Chipotle and had a baby...it would be Fired Pie!   I tried fire pie for the first time this past Saturday at the Northsite location. I immediately was dumbfounded at the fact that nobody had thought of this concept up until recently. So now I have been to fire pie twice, with this location being visited today for lunch. Yes I enjoyed it that much that I went and had it again but two days later. Lol  Fresh ingredients, your pie or salad custom made right in front of your face, and seriously fast service / cooking time. Both times I have the steak and blue, crispy, and easy on the oil and garlic.    Yup, I have found a new lunch time spot to add to the rotation! :)"}
{"text":"I just got lunch here, and came back, signed up for Yelp so that I could leave this review.  The food was very good. Very fresh. The employees were very kind and ready to help. I asked for a gluten free crust, and the gentleman changed his gloves as to limit contamination of gluten ingredients. Then he proceeded to make the whole pizza so that no one else touched the pizza.  I didn't realized how much I would appreciate that. I felt taken care of, rather than seen as a nuisance.  The lil salad was actually a nice decent size. For a gluten free pizza and a lil salad, and a tea, my total was $16.00. I expect to have some left over for lunch tomorrow, so I think it was a good deal. A bonus, they also have pizzookies! warm oven cookies with ice cream. I didn't have one, but its a nice option. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for no star. Worst    Service ever, we ordered pizza and got no pizza for half an hour and people came after us started receiving their orders and when we asked about it we got a cold pizza that was sitting forever on counter with a cold apology. With a open kitchen if you don't see pizza waiting to be served that means all you see is the color of customer. I hate places that discriminate like this. And an order of burnt cookie with ice cream. Seems like they need better humans to work for them. Really disgusted."}
{"text":"Get the pookie!!! No seriously - go right now. It's yummy.  We just happened to see one of the owners on Channel 3 news and decided to head over for lunch. So glad we did!  Service was top of the line and food was great!  Not to mention the joy of being able to feed 3 adults and a kid for under $30. The price is fantastic,  not crazy $2 charge per topping, it's one price add what you like and enjoy.  We will without a doubt be back!"}
{"text":"I would say better than I expected. It's like Subway in a couple ways. 1. Not super comfortable chairs, and pretty chilly a/c (Phx really overdoes the a/c). 2. Choose your ingredients as you go down the line and they make your pizza in front of you. Then you pay and wait just 5-10 minutes for the pizza. Spartan interior with little graphics and decor. Very friendly staff, I think the owner was one of them. The ingredients looked like good quality. I got the pizza with all of the italian meats. Mmm. Crust is that wonderful combo of crispy outside and chewy inside. So good. Improve the comfort factor inside and another star awaits."}
{"text":"I have eaten at two locations now, this one and Park Central in downtown Phoenix. It's an amazingly simple concept, you custom build a pizza (think Chipotle) and it comes out of the oven in about 5 minutes. The toppings are fresh and good quality, and I really like the super-thin crust.  I miss Luke's of Chicago, which used to occupy this space, but the wonderful pizza is helping me get over the loss. A solid 4 star rating!"}
{"text":"The fact that we can get a pizza for both my kids to share and the cost is the same no matter how many toppings you add makes this place the absolute best! Their pizzas are delicious and large enough to feed 1-2 people. I ask to get my pizza cooked a little longer because I like crispier crust and they are very accomodating."}
{"text":"This location is dangerously close to where I live. The pizza is absolutely delicious and I love being able to design my personal pizza. Fired Pie has tons of options for your pizza desires! Also, on the wall you can find a menu that has all of the classic pizzas so all you have to do is mention the name, opposed to describe a regular cheese pizza. There are a few different types of crusts to choose from, tons of sauces, cheeses, and toppings.   As for customer service, the employees are great. They are super friendly and there is someone ready at each 'station' to help the pizza making process fly by. However, spelling names correctly is not their specialty, but that is no big deal. If anything, it is quite comical to read the writing.   Originally I stopped by Fired Pie because while in California, I visited Blaze Pizza. It is quite evident that they are direct competitors. They are essentially replicas of one another, but Fired Pie has more locations in Arizona and they give you the choice of a custom large salad, unlike Blaze.   P.S. Make sure you try a pizza with buffalo sauce, mozzarella and buffalo chicken! It is a personal favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Heard about this place form a friend and wanted to try it out. The pizza is really good. They press the dough for each pizza, they you can add whatever you want to make your own creation. Then, they fire the pie and it takes only a few minutes to cook it perfectly. I was impressed by the crispness of the crust and the variety of toppings. I also had a salad. The greens were good and all the pizza toppings were available for the salad, too. Oh, and I should mention they serve beer. Kiltlifter and pizza ... Who am I kidding? Kiltlifter goes with anything."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I went there yesterday.  Love the choices. Fresh salad, fresh pizza. Wish I had one closet to home."}
{"text":"This is a great concept. Things are set up sorta like subway or chipotle style where you can pick one of the suggested pizzas or the employee builds it custom to your ordering right on front of you. They fire up the pizzas and bring them out to you after they are cooked. We enjoyed the pizza, we made one custom, toppings tasted fresh and the crust was thin just how we like it."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Highly recommend the \"Meaty Italian\" with choice of both meats. The flavor is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Looking for a light but feeling pizza that hits the spot. The create your own gives a good chance for a unique taste."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening after coming down from Dobbins Lookout in South Phoenix. It's right on Baseline when you come down from South Mountain Park. This place is very similar to a place back home (California) called Pieology or if you've ever had Blaze Pizza or 800 Degrees. You can make your own pizza basically all for a set price of $8.29 plus tax. You can choose the type of sauce you want (garlic oil, pesto, tomato, alfredo, BBQ, oil). You can choose the types of cheese and basically have as many toppings (meats/veggies) as you want. I like my pizza meaty so I got the garlic oil with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and sausage, pepperoni, meatball, and salami. I think it was pretty good but having all the meats made it a little too salty, not exactly sure what it was but next time I'm going to get the alfredo sauce and less variety of meats lol. My friend got half alfredo half pesto sauce and it smelled AMAZING. I like this place because everyone can have exactly what they want, you can even do half half pizza with different things if you're indecisive. They also have preset pizzas that cost the same price as the custom. They also had pizookies (pizza cookie?) lol with ice cream for $3 and it looked bomb.   Overall this was a great place to grab a quick bite to eat and catch up with friends or have a super casual meal."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town! Very cheap for what they offer, the customer service is just amazing, I had a Meaty Italian with spicy sausage but it was custom made and the employee ended up adding a bunch of toppings to make it better, yummy! 5 stars hands down, don't think twice, just go!"}
{"text":"OMG! So good. The staff is absolutely amazing as well. I think this just may be my favorite restaurant at San tan mall. Keep it up guys, just amazing!oh and the fired Pookie is so good if you want dessert"}
{"text":"A restaurant that showcases the trend to pizza as fast food in that they have pre-made crusts and ingredients laid out like one might see at Chipolte with first, a number of sauces (from red sauce to olive oil and garlic), a variety of cheeses, including house made mozzarella, then a variety of meat toppings, and then a fairly large selection of vegi toppings. All the pizzas seem to be the same price, no matter how many toppings you want, which is nice, and then they stick it in a blazing hot oven for several minutes and voila, a pizza for one. A pizza like this and a drink is $10.20 - a good concept and it was near where I work or live, I nice work-day lunch option. However, the crust is not quite as crispy as say Pomo's crust (downtown Phoenix) - good but not up to that quality, but it is cheaper by several dollars.  I'll admit, I don't do a lot of fast food, either it is sit down or it is generally cook at home so I have a feeling that I'm just not a fan of quick pizza so that is why it is say, a 3 instead of a 4. In addition, when I see pizza I keep thinking a place that serves alcohol, like Fired Pie, should have more than mega-brand beers and should have several local beers on tap. Somehow I just don't want to wash down a pizza with a cheap yellow beer made by some large brewery conglomerate like InBev. I would also like to see some integration of locally made produce and yes, i know, that is not how a business model like this works - it is all about low cost provider but hey, Chipotle seems to do it so this place could as well.  If you want a quick, hot, lunch, without too much fuss, this is fine, but to draw me back, some localizing of ingredients would be necessary so I would know I'm not just ordering a pizza, I'm supporting some other local producers in the process."}
{"text":"Tried this location because it was close to my office. I thought it was generally a weak rendition of mod pizza or Pieology. They only have one size which is their large pizza which in my opinion is too big for one person so no option for a smaller personal size pizza. The ambience and design of the restaurant itself isn't as modern or upbeat as a mod pizza. All in all food is decent but I can Only give it two stars. Probably wouldn't return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Quick and easy pizza is the model for Fired Pie. This pizza chain is good and does pizza right. I like the choices of pizza topping and the option to add a salad to be healthy. Lastly they have beer with a warm cookie dessert. The price is less than 10 dollars and unlimited topping. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Going to give 5 stars because I like the company and the staff is always awesome, but this store is not up to speed yet based on the flow of other locations.    Overall, same great pizza and awesome staff.  I appreciate the fact that they are not afraid to add toppings to pizza.     Looking forward to seeing this place run smooth.   PS, no fault of Fired Pie, it's a small crowded  parking lot."}
{"text":"I like the convenience of a quick customized personal pizza and the employees are awesome!!  They have a great selection of toppings that can be piled higher than most of my friends.   Personal preference, I'm not crazy about the pizza sauce, so I go for the garlic oil or other options.  (We all have our marinara preference so, it's not bad, it's not my taste)  The only two things to look out for; if it's a busy day, there's burned crumbs on your pizza.  The other is that they aren't always the best with food safety  Typically there's one person distributing meat and another veggies. One person might help out the other so, meat gloved hands might touch veggies and vice versa.  I will call them out due to some allergies. I still love the place."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Arizona this became a staple for me as it's quick and easy. I have yet to have a bad pizza from this location and the staff is always friendly. Even when they are busy they get the line moving and food out."}
{"text":"Whenever we go out for pizza, we always compare it to some old favorites: Oregano's, Sauce, and California Pizza Kitchen.  Most of the time, pizza places can't even meet our \"minimum\" standard of Domino's.  Sad but true.  Now it's time to add another favorite to the list.  It's surprising how fast the pizza is ready to eat and there isn't much of a wait since it bakes quickly and fresh ingredients are ready to put on the pizza.  Their vegetarian pizza is one of the best on their menu.  I've also had the tomato basil and a chicken pesto combo.  The thin crust is perfection, cheese is stringy as if it was freshly made, and the sauce is great.  We live in the north valley and it's great to have more choices for pizza.  I'm especially impressed that it is less of a sit down restaurant and has high quality pizza at the same time.  The prices are very reasonable too even including a tip.  The selection of tea is meh if you're a hardcore tea drinker like me.  I brew loose leaf Lupicia all the time at home, but the basic drink options are expected of a place like this.  If you are shopping at Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland Commons, this location is perfect as it's close by (even for walking).  No wait and great pizza.  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Burnt crust. Salt overload. Pretty much inedible. Wish I could have my 9 bucks back. Not sure how this place stays in business. I know I'm not coming back here to eat, ever."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting my parents for Christmas.  It is tucked in the corner right next to Paradise Bakery if you have a hard time finding it.   This is basically Chipotle for pizzas.  They have set salads & build your own salad as well.  My parents chose this option and they really enjoyed their salads, but they are pretty big so they were unable to finish them.  The line was decent size, but went very quick.  The pizza options were broken down to several categories: sauce, cheese, meat, veggies, and fresh herbs.  They do not charge more for adding any of the options (don't know if you ask for extra portions though).  I suggest that you do not get fresh tomato, it makes the pizza very soggy afterwards.  I made the mistake, don't repeat it!  Other than that, my pizza was delicious!  I also had the Pookie, just love that name!  Don't be surprised, it is a normal sized cookie.  I am so used to huge cookies done this way, but it's only $3 so you cannot expect too much.    Warning, they do have Pepsi products!  Boo!  They also do have a nice selection of iced teas so that made up for the Pepsi faux pas.   Will I be back?  Definitely, but will not order the fresh tomatoes on my pizza."}
{"text":"Service is bad and the staff has attitude when questions asked.   Prefer MOD Pizza,  they are much more welcoming and the overall food quality is better.   We will not return."}
{"text":"Customer service is seriously lacking at  this location.   Asking for a to go box for pizza,  the staff had attitude  and also when ordering.   Not going back."}
{"text":"All I can Say is AWESOME. I am rating this a 5 star for flavor. Now my friends don't have to put up with my picky eating habits! Can you leave off the____, add some____ and some of ____ on the side?   If you are a sauce person like me, ask for more than one scoop or you will miss the amazing taste. I have never seen such a small ladle! They are quite stingy on the sauce so I ask for 3 scoops :) A bigger ladle perhaps?  Where else can you go to get whatever you want on your pizza and it is the perfect size for one person. Annnnnnnnnd has an awesome crust (not too thin) and FLAVOR!!! for $8.00? Certainly NOT Pizza Bianco!  It does get really crowded after 5 with screaming kids and soccer moms so we usually go mid day or get it to go. The line does go fast though. We were \"gym shopping\" the day we went for lunch. Yes I know, the hypocrisy was just oozing that day.   This is Noelle reporting from Chandler, AZ  YUM!  P.S. The photos on here are considered to be food porn by most Stoners so they should only be viewed by mature adults who haven't been smoking anything. ;D"}
{"text":"OMG YUM! This is a no brainer. Everyone gets what they want. I call this Diabetic pizza because of the nice thin crust. The sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have had their petezer before, and I love the burnt crust. Cheesy goodness, with Pepperoni.    I just went back and got their Steak and Blue salad. I'm a bit confused on where the \"Blue\" part comes into play. No Blue Cheese on the salad. The steak that is crumbled onto the salad was yummy. They tossed some sauteed onions and green peppers. That was surprisingly good.  The salad comes with a sweet Vinaigrette, it's to sweet, and really thick. I didn't care for it to much, it's so sweet, it leaves you thirsty ASF.  Steak and Blue...Interestingly enough Blue Cheese isn't even an option for a dressing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   The wait to order kinda sucks, the line was out the door and that was at Noon. Get there early or get there late, but don't get there when it's noon, you'll spend your lunch break looking at the back of some schmucks head in line ahead of you.  ~Big Daddy Long Strokes"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I love the gluten free crust and the way you can customize your pizza.  However, the staff is pretty spacey and unorganized. We had to give our names 4 times. If they have better organization and better customer service, this place would be a 5-star eatery."}
{"text":"The  signature pizza's they make is totally out of the world,thin crust fired pies that just melt in your mouth. Drool.  All at an incredibly low price. Interestingly, you get to choose as many toppings as you would like without an additional $ . I ordered a to-go pizza over phone and picked it up from their location. It seemed like the waiting times were long and they had a pretty large crowd to cater to. Must try , if you are in the area  and they got couple of other locations around Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good.  The place had a good feeling to it.  Service was great.  First time here so they explained everything.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Fired PIE!!!  This place is legit! You walk in order WHATEVER you want and as MUCH as you want! Dawah, hooked it up! Gotta check these guys out!!"}
{"text":"Before I list the reason this location needs more attention, I do want to point out that the customer service is amazing, and the workers are genuine and  very courteous. The reason I am giving this place a four star review is although the customer service is somewhat redeeming, the music is too loud and it makes it very hard to hear the workers and order as they probably can't hear me over the very large glass barrier which gets annoying when you have to continually repeat yourself. I have been to this location a couple of times now and have started to realize that this is a problem for other customers as well, though they attribute it to the employees \"bad attitudes\" I don't believe that's the case and I am empathetic to the amount of grief they're given for something they have no control over.  Again I want to reiterate that the customer service is excellent and I'm always greeted with a smile! And the food is amazing too I might add, keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place based upon the reviews. The pricing is great! The pizza was not spectacular. I liked the thin crust. The service was ok. My pizza sat out on the table for 10 minutes before they gave it to me. There was something I couldn't figure out what that made the pizza taste a little strange."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I come in whenever I get the chance.  I love the style of this place.  It reminds me of a Chipotle by the way you order your food.  I usually get the chicken pesto pizza which is very delicious and just add mushrooms.  The dough has a hint of sweetness to it that makes the crust very tasty.  They are quick with your order too.  I can usually finish 3/4 of my pizza if I'm super hungry.  All in all I like this place very much.  The atmosphere is lovely and the location is ideal."}
{"text":"We are eating here right now and it was amazing. They have all the pizza toppings in front of you and you select which ones you want for $7.95 then they toss it in the oven. They have a huge selection of meats and cheeses like salami, capicola, spicy sausage, gorgonzola, fontina and fresh mozzarella plus all the usuals as well. We both loved our pizza and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Just opened, but they have years of pizza restaurant experience.  The food atmosphere and service is exceptional.  Highly recommend the create your own!"}
{"text":"So happy to see Fired Pie at this location. To tell you the truth they are really taking the Valley by storm. Love the concept and service. The pies are always cooked to perfection, salads fresh and plentiful and you can't beat the Bellini! Way to go Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"Not bad for \"chipotle style\" pizza.   Went here for the first time. They had just opened so figured we would give it shot since it wasn't busy.   Menu is pretty simple you can either choose between one of their speciality pizzas or build your own. Price is 7.95 for a 12\".     The pizza was pretty good.  No complaints as we ordered the Hawaiian BBQ and ordered a pepperoni for it girls.  Was well baked and crust was nice and crispy.  Sauce was good.  Overall had a decent experience.     My only complaint is how incredibly slow they were. There were only two other people there and they claim to be fast paced chipotle style, but we waited almost 20 minutes for our pizzas.   Over all it was good not great.  I won't go out of my way, but if it's convenient I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Saw the new sign recently and decided to try for lunch over the weekend.  It's basically the same layout as the former Italian Pellini (RIP) with a change of menu to pizza and salads.  You order and the pizza is constructed in front of you by very eager staff.  We very surprised at the speed of delivery on the pizza - and it was real pizza, very fresh with a nice thin & crispy crust.  We had a pepperoni and one of the suggested creations Hawaiian BBQ (substituting tomato sauce for BBQ).  At $7.95 for 11\" personal sized pizza or salad of your choosing, I'm sure we'll be back.  If you're on a time crunch and have a hankering for real pizza, give this place a go.  Hey even the guy from Five Guys Burgers down the strip came in for a to-go order!  The only neg to note was a staff member met up with some friends and they all went outside for a smoke on the patio.  Right outside the front door.  Clearly a violation of the AZ smoking laws.  We were on our way out so we held our breath and blew through the smoke.  Still, management should be aware and reminding staff of smoking laws.  If we were on our way IN, this would have been a real turnoff.    In cooler weather, the patio would be a very nice place to enjoy a meal al fresco."}
{"text":"Today my co-workers and I called in orders for carry out at Fired Pie. We ordered 4 pizzas and were told that our expected pick up time would be 15 minutes. We arrived approximately 15 minutes later and were greeted after waiting a few minutes at the cash register while only one employee catered to the line of walk in ordering customers. When we asked about our order the cashier did not have an idea where it was and went into the back to ask if anyone had taken our order. Three additional employees came out from the back and we were told by whom appeared to be he person in charge that they didn't have our order. As I was explaining that I had just made our order over the phone another employee said \"oh, they are right here\" where our pizza orders had been written down but were not cooked.   The manager (who was our current cashier) said \"give us a few more minutes\" and they proceeded to make pizzas for a multitude of customers who had arrived after our group. There never was an acknowledge that our orders had been forgotten and when I asked if we should be prepared to wait at least 35 minutes in the future for phone orders I was told that it \"depended on how busy they were\".   My real question is why 3 of 4 employees are in the back of house when all of the cooking is done in front of the customers and customer orders are going unfulfilled. Additionally, if you blatantly fail process a customer order in the time frame you had quoted an apology would be appropriate.   Lastly, one of our pizzas was not prepared with the ordered ingredients.   Not satisfied!!"}
{"text":"I had Fired Pie for the first time today. The staff was friendly. My husband made his own \"pie\" and I had the margherita pizza. They were both good but nothing I would be really excited over. We also had the macadamia nut cookie which comes with ice cream. We thought it was pretty good. It's a pretty small size and worth the $3- $4.  I like the location. There is an outdoor patio with the view of like a pond and nice houses. Overall, I would come back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Finally came here with my boyfriend last Friday for dinner and it was sooo good!! You get to create your own personal pizza; sauce, cheese, meats, veggies, etc... I would definitely come back. It can get busy so if you're going for peak lunch or dinner times be prepared to wait. The line moved quickly though. Sorry this isn't a super long review but there isn't much more to say other than get over there and create your own slice of heaven! Ha get it!? lol  ;)"}
{"text":"Everything I've said in my previous review still stands - their food is still scrumptious, but their service needs a bit of work.  One day I come in, the staff look dirty and tired as if they hadn't taken a shower or gotten any sleep in days (I get that it's hot back there - I've served my time in the food industry, but that's no excuse).  And in general, if you ask for more than x number of toppings, they'll more often than not, shoot you a dirty look for giving them the extra work of grabbing a few more toppings than the last person.  I'm not holding up the line, nobody is behind me.  And it's obvious that they give you less of each topping the more you get, else they'd be out of business.  So I really don't see why they should be so visibly upset.  Also, I found it rather weird that the girl who was working with the pizzas suddenly switched to being the cashier.  I'm not sure how that works but my thoughts were that the cashier generally doesn't switch to working with food and vice versa?  Anywho, the food still tastes great but the service often leaves me feeling a little peeved."}
{"text":"Fired Pie has good pizza, well, about the same as Mod Pizza, but a touch better. The dining room is dirty and doesn't feel as welcoming as mod. The pizza cookie is ok. I'll probably be frequenting Mod over Fired since they dining room is nice and they have fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"Im going to make this a brief review. Of the 4 different \" DIY pizza \" joints I have visited, this one takes the cake. The sauce/toppings choices are superb..and the bake of the crust was perfect...nice and crispy..with the slightest char on the edges. The staff was friendly, and I barely had time to get my drink and sit dow, and the pizza was already being brought to my table. I will be back"}
{"text":"Love the pizzas - create your own  or pick a recommended one. Service is fast and friendly, price is great and ingredients fresh. Kids and adults alike will love this."}
{"text":"First time going and we loved it! I got a pepperoni and salad and my husband made his own. We definitely will go back and take the kids."}
{"text":"Always yummy and cash back with Yelp. Can not beat that. This place is busy at lunch with a full parking lot. Line moves fast."}
{"text":"The Chipotles of pizzas and salads (minus the e-coli)! I thoroughly enjoyed this place! We went on the grand opening for a free personal pizza or salad. For a grand opening with freebies the place was ran so well! I call this the Chipotle of pizzas and salads because the building is literally laid out the same but instead of throwing your ingredients in a burrito or tacos, it's a pizza or salad. Everything tastes so fresh here which is probably the best part. The \"personal\" pizzas are enough for two. This isn't your greasy pizza and wings type of place but that's what makes it awesome. The ingredients are fresh and everything is made right in front of you. Without a doubt I recommend going here. If you are looking for a different style of pizza, something other than dripping grease pizza and salads that don't taste fresh, then go here!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has slipped enough that I almost don't care what's happened with the service. Almost. I care enough to update my review.  I went on a Saturday for lunch. Restaurant was almost empty except for the 30-something man ahead of me in line, who was an object of fascination to the 40-something female clerk working the ingredients line. Maybe his daily visits are the highlight of her lonely existence. Maybe he's Clark Kent. Maybe they dated, back when she was a wealthy socialite, but he won't recognize her existence now that she's reduced to making personal pizzas. Maybe she was his nanny and hopes he'll recognize her. Maybe he's an eligible bachelor who has promised to marry the woman who makes him a perfect pizza.  Certainly, she was trying to make him the perfect pizza. She lavished ingredients on his pizza while picking pieces off mine to make sure I didn't get one single extra piece of sausage. Not one! Gotta protect those profit margins! The result is that I've had $1 frozen personal pizzas with more generous topping distribution. (And yet, the resulting pizza was still greasy, underdone at the middle, and burnt at the edges.)  I'd been planning to order a glass of wine, but I figured with the care taken to not overload my pizza, the restaurant's margins were already well-protected. I'd also planned to tip, but by the time the clerk cooed Mr. Wonderful's name to call his order but snarled mine impatiently because I wasn't lingering by the counter but had gone to get a table, that also was a non-starter.  The whole time, the young female manager was training another staff member within earshot but was apparently okay with it all.  I'm clean, quiet, modestly dressed, and prepared to tip. I have all my teeth, no running sores, and nothing that suggests infectious disease. If I'm by myself, I aim for hours when the restaurant isn't busy, so that I'm not taking up a two-top that's in demand for parties of two (or, worse, a four-top in demand for parties of four). I'm getting really tired of condescending, judgmental clerks for whom even that's not good enough. Y'all are waitstaff at middle-class restaurants, so you have NOTHING to be snobby about."}
{"text":"Customize your pizza for no upcharge! You can also order the artisans suggestions (I go the tomato basil - tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, garlic and added pepperoni). The crust is super thin and the cheese was great. Great iced tea options.   This place beats Blaze across the street as you can create your own salad as well. Quick service and friendly staff. Why no plates though? It is more of a waste to split a pizza and have to use another box.."}
{"text":"I really like Fired Pie. The concept is great, the prices are reasonable, the food is fresh. I go to one by my work and compared to this one, this one was a little sloppy. The food station didn't seem as clean as it could have, the drink area was really horribly laid out (there was not a lot of room to work with, but still), but overall my salad and the pizza tasted good. The ambiance could use a little help though."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a to-go salad. Most people get the pizza here, but I always enjoy a huge salad with unlimited toppings. The handfuls of meats and veggies are always very generous and I know I can count on my daily serving of vegetables when I come here. Now I know that's not what most people want to read about and why they come to a pizza place, but it works for me! My dining companions always get a pizza and pretty much eat the whole thing, so I know it must be good :)"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza but was disgusted at the nasty flies in the kitchen near all the topping. Management should do a better job ensuring their staff is well groomed. A guy looks like he hasn't showered in weeks."}
{"text":"I just have to express my happiness for finally trying this place for the first time!! You can load as much ingredients as you want on a thin crust for just $8!!   Just $8 + tax!!  And guess what? It tasted incredible!! This place sure beats any other fancy pizza place. They don't skimp out on ingredients like you usually see at some Sub*** or other pizza place (where they sprinkle 8 black olive slices on a foot long. And when you ask for more or double the amount they sprinkle exactly 6 more black olive slices).   Today's Fired Pie was loaded with garlic oil, fresh mozzarella cheese, chicken, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and of course plenty of olives!   They are generous with their portion and with their service! Thank you Fired Pie team for that!!   I shall return!!"}
{"text":"Got the steak and blue salad and a drink for under $10! And, it's custom made so you can pick what you want/don't want on it :)"}
{"text":"One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience, said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted, and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.  We called in an order last night, exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce, one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!  Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First, the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then, when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount, she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90)   THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie, do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up, and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS, because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad, which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie, it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck."}
{"text":"Great fresh food at a fantastic price!  Go there!  :)"}
{"text":"This place has such potential, I just wish they put out consistently good pizza every time. We've ordered pizza to go at least 10 times since they opened, and the last few times the crust has been burnt. Not slightly crispy, but black on the top and bottom of the crust to the point where it just doesn't taste good to eat it. I unfortunately won't eat pizza from here anymore, but my husband refuses to throw in the towel because he loves the concept so much."}
{"text":"Here is a company that really cares.   I just want to take a minute to express my gratitude to this business and the people who run it.  First, the food here is really good. I love the concept of making your own pizza. They have ingredients like capicola, kalamata olives, fresh teas, and gluten free crust options to choose from.  There's a good amount of choices. The salads are delicious too, I normally get the Fired Italian.   Second, this establishment is always clean.  Third, I ran into a customer concern and the co-owner Fred Morgan responded to me promptly. He truly cared about my experience and took immediate action to fix it.  I think that is amazing that these people really care about their customers. They even partner with non-profit organizations like No Kid Hungry to help take action to end child hunger in America.   So, if you are in Tanger Outlets (or by their other locations) - you won't be disappointed. It's such a gratifying feeling of supporting local businesses that are more than just the products they sell.   Thank you Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time. It was 8pm and I had not eaten any solid food at all so I needed something light but tasty.  OMG! So good, ten times better than pizza studio!  I picked the margherita pizza, they use a special chunky tomato sauce that is so yummy.  I spent a month in Italy few years back and I had pizza in Naples and other cities and I have to say this pizza was better! It was cooked to perfection, I love thin crust.  The employees were awesome, so friendly, even delivered my pie to my table..it was my first time here so I wasn't sure what the procedure was. They also have 4 different flavors of tea to choose from. Tons of parking, right off Central Ave.  My new favorite spot for pizza, because the price and quality is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Got the tomato basil pizza.it was really good and service was really fast. They put the basil on the side, which was different but fine. Good drink selection also.  Usually at fired pie, they say, \"any other meats\" which is funny, but not at this one. Four star."}
{"text":"A little bit of a hidden location, but a good spot for some pizza.  Good menu with lots of options.  We went in the afternoon and it was not very busy, but I'm sure they get a good lunch pop with all the businesses in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the reviews.  It is a great concept wish they executed it better.  I ordered a pie with fresh mozzarella and they do not have enough of the fresh mozzarella to cover the entire pie so they also put on the shredded processed cheese.  Tomato sauce, grilled chicken, mushrooms, red onion, pineapple and wanted raw spinach but they only have cooked spinach because when they cook their pies since the flames come from the top anything which is not cooked will burn such as fresh spinach, basil, oregano etc.  I thought the plastic wall in front of the pizza making stations either need to be lower or the help need to be taller because the ladies doing my pizza could not hear over the plastic unless I yelled, then everyone in the restaurant heard everyone else yelling.  Some did not bother and just went with it. The  booths were comfortable, when in this restaurant in Chandler sit in a booth because the chairs are really really hard and very uncomfortable. My pizza was over cooked and burnt on the bottom and as I was looking around 95% of the pizzas were burnt on the bottom not real sure why but it was a good place to try one time but will not be back. The concept is good wish they executed much better and the pies tasted better tasted more like toppings on cardboard than a pizza.  You walk in order your food.  The line was very long and I waited more than 25 minutes to order the food, then another 10 minutes or so to get my food.  So it is definitely not in the fast food realm.  There are better places to eat better more healthy food than fired pie good place to try once.  the price for the pies or salads are around $8.60."}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend eating here. Although the atmosphere is good, and the pizza is tempting since its baked in the brick oven, there is some serious cross-contamination going on. We ordered salads, which were made by the staff reaching into every container... meats, to cheese, to lettuce and greens with the SAME gloves. Also, staff were not helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I've ever been to!  The atmosphere is super fun, the service makes you feel like you're part of the family and the pizza is amazing!!  This is a great place to have speedy lunch break, the food is ready before you know it. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with long reviews. Yet here I am, writing one about pizza smh...Disclaimer: I've eaten at FP in Ahwatukee dozens of times, and absolutely looooove it, sooo this review is slightly biased. With that said, I'm actually writing this as I wait for my 'za to come back out from being remade, and this review is about the Superb service, not the heavenly discs of love they refer to as pizzas.   I initially went in earlier this evening and found a packed house. Not surprising. The line was moving quickly, random kids were being weird and nutty, as kids tend to be, and the pizza preparers were smiling and cheery. I ordered a few (5 to be exact) pizzas for our family, and waited for them to be brought out. When they arrived, I found that 3/5 were , but 2 were a bit burnt. For the average person this would likely prove to be a small matter. Alas, for my gf it is the end of the world as we know it. (Just don't go there ).  One of the team members saw me double-checking the boxes and came to see if the pizzas were ok. I told him about the burnt edges and he actually offered, more accurately was totally happy to take them back and remake them for me. Didn't wait for me to ask and act like he shouldn't offer a resolution. Didn't have an attitude about it. He actually said, verbatim, 'let us redo them for you, man. You shouldn't have to settle'. He had them remade, and kept the others in the warmer. When he returned with the replacements, he checked each box w/ me, just to ensure my satisfaction.   It's widely known that people buy from people they like, and I can honestly say the customer service at this joint is on power level 9000. Add a great pizza into the mix, and you have a recipe for success."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! made to order right in front of you. a lot of toppings to choose from. One price for the pizza regardless of the amount of toppings you get. The price for a pizza is very reasonable. Fast and friendly service.  The only negative is the number of people that end up in line during the lunch rush. But the staff moves the line very quickly."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pizza. Better than Papa Murphy's, or those mediteranian 1000 degree places. On par with Pizza Hut or Barros.  Margaritas were good."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. All staff seems to enjoy working there. Eaten here more times than I can count and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I wouldn't even do that. I would give this location a negative rating. The customer service here was HORRENDOUS, I will never come back here. They promised a $3.14 pie on \"Pi day\" but told us we needed to buy a drink to use the discount. In the end it cost just as much for a one topping pizza as it did for a regular pizza. To make things worse, the workers skimped on the toppings after DROPPING THE FIRST PIZZA THEY MADE. To make matters worse, they didn't even apologize for the 30 min wait and didn't even mention dropping the pizza. Never go here. Always choose blaze pizza over this fired pie location."}
{"text":"WOW. If you like pizza, this is a must! Thin crust, many options, fast and fresh. I'm really surprised by the quality of ingredients and dough. Will definitely become a regular"}
{"text":"I LOVE Fired Pie. The food was excellent, completely customizable (which I'm obsessed with) and the ingredients are well cooked. DEF recommend!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!  I live near this location at Ray & 101 and have been watching anxiously for it to open. Saw it was open for business tonight and stopped in with my two teenagers... Everyone was able to customize their personal pizza just the way they wanted and It was AWESOME! The kids said it was the best pizza they ever had!  I like to \"gourmet\" mine up and keep it healthy - so easy to do with grilled chicken, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes and jalapeños. The  pizzas cooked quickly and were still nice and hot when we got home. The crust was delicious and uniformly cooked to a golden brown.  LOVE Fired Pie - This will be our new regular carryout spot!  PS - They also serve CHINA MIST TEA - in several flavors... this is getting harder to find as more restaurants \"cut costs\" and switch to a lesser brand of tea."}
{"text":"super interesting concept, very tasty food. Subway of pizza, but much nicer. Think more chipotle (but without the rectal bleeding.) The crust was crispy and delicious, I loaded the pizza itself up with a load of shit that probably doesn't go together but is delectable in my mouth. If I remember correctly I only paid around 10$ and still had 2 slices left over for dinner. Staff was very friendly in explaining how it worked to me because I walked in and just did the thing where you stare at the menu with your mouth open, unable to decipher it.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disaster. The pizza was undercooked and droopy --not at all what I expect in a thin crust. The naked Caesar salad was good. But the service: so slow! Three employees together assembled one pizza at a time, at almost five minutes each. A pizza would go into the oven and come out before the next was even assembled. This place is never going to survive Spring Training."}
{"text":"Overall, think of Subway but for pizza.  Good food but not somewhere you want to take a date, well unless you want it to be your last. Prices are ok, on the middle priced side $9-12 each but keep in mind, that is the price everywhere for a 12 inch or smaller pizza.  It has seating but most seem to only plan to pick it up and take it home.   Good food, simple but at $25 for the two of us we agree an atmosphere would have to be worth another $10.  Staff was friendly but of high school age and did well in that enviornment, there seemed to be about 5 working behind the counter.  I think if we are investing in a fun night out we will go to a restaurant but if in need for a quick lunch item this may be a good place.  Like i said Subway but for pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to a few different \"create your own pizza\" type of places but this is the first time that I have tried fired pie. The second I walked in it seemed like everyone who worked there was miserable. None of them smiled or even offered to explain the concept to people who said they have never been there before. Overall the pizza was good in the end which is why I am giving it three stars but the service was just not up to par and it was not a very inviting place to go to. Next time I will try Mod Pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Pizza is perfectly sized for one person (or one me sized person). Crust was perfect combination of crispy and chewy and the sauce was good. I like the line style food production which makes for quick prep time. Better variety of toppings than most pizza places."}
{"text":"Love this new pizza joint. Made to order custom pizzas and salads for $7.75. And they are delish! End your meal with a deliciously warm Pookie :) cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite while shopping at Fashion Square.  Got a steak and blue cheese pizza, that needed more blue cheese.  It mostly had mozzarella so it was missing the true blue cheese flavor.  The pizza crust was perfectly crispy though."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since they have opened and love this place. Their gluten free pizza is amazing and a fantastic option for this of us that like to be both frugal and have to eat gluten free. The pizza is huge and usually lasts me 2-3 meals. Although the staff is mostly young, they are excellent pizza makers. I will continually be coming back and referring this place whenever I get the chance. Check it out guys, it's one of the best pizza places in town!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and love the prices!  I've only ever done the create your own, and I've never been disappointed.  So tasty!  Their salads are tasty too.  I always go with family, so we share a salad and pizza and it's plenty of food.  It's quick too, which we like because we   have a 6 year old who doesn't sit still for extended periods of time.  It's never been super busy either and they have great customer service.  Very welcoming and patient :)  It's quickly become a go to stop for my family."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because it's fast and not too expensive. My son has celiac's disease and can't eat gluten so I like that they have gluten-free option pizza. The staff also goes out of their way to change their gloves and clean the area to prevent cross-contamination. I really appreciate that, not a lot of restaurants can do that for us. We have never been disappointed with our food choices there either :-)I always create my own salad and my son creates his own pizza, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for lunch several times a week.  I like this pizza because the crust is thin and not overly filling.  The customer service is great."}
{"text":"I really like the build your own pizza concept.  My only complaint is that they skimp on items because some people ask to put every single item on their pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place,  yes a great pave to get your pizza on, always clean always fresh and always great tasting; it's always worth it to get a fired pie"}
{"text":"So yummy. I usually get a pesto sauce pizza with cheese, mushrooms, spinach and artichoke. Simply delicious. I wish they weren't so stingy with the toppings though. Lol!"}
{"text":"I LOVED my pizza here!!!  It had a thin crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese AND I got to tell them what I wanted on it and they didn't skimp at all!  I had Canadian bacon, purple onions, olives and tomatoes on my pizza.  There were so many other toppings to choose from, but those are my favorite.  And it's so inexpensive!  They also have salads--a small size and a large size.  Again, pick your lettuce, pick your toppings and dressing.  Next time I'll try a small salad with my pizza--that way I'll have more pizza left over.  Speaking of leftovers, I had my pizza for breakfast; and I must say, it's almost better heated up the next day.  Can't wait to go back!  I almost forgot!--If you check in on Yelp while you're here, you get a FREE Fired Pookie!"}
{"text":"I think they are lacking on some staff training. The staff is very young and the service greatly varies. I wish they would train staff better on applying portions consistently. The food itself is good enough and the pizza crust isn't overly heavy, it's a good sized pizza for one person to enjoy. I've had a couple of ingredients vary as far as freshness, but that hasn't been the norm."}
{"text":"Absurdity is the polar opposite of this concept. Build your own pizza. Super thin crust so it cooks in minutes. My GF and I were in and out within 15 minutes and the pizza was customized to our interests. I recommend this pizza place to anyone looking for a upscale feel in pizza quality, with the chipotle'esq concept. I will be back! Kudos to Fired Pie!"}
{"text":"You simply cannot beat their price if you are looking for a quality personal-size pizza. Choose from one of their own pizza creations or build your own custom pie. If you go it alone you get to pick your sauce, cheese, meats, veggies and herbs - and the price stays the same. They even allow you to customize with extra sauce or toppings and even alter how long you want it cooked (crispy or regular). After all this, it's delivered to your table hot within 10 minutes or less.  They also have a nice selection of salads to choose from - and of course, you can build your own!  Service here is great and the staff is very friendly. If you are headed to Fired Pie for lunch plan on arriving early - this place gets crazy busy after 11:30am."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party for my 9 year old daughter and 6 of her friends at Built A Bear Workshop in Fashion Square Mall. We also had her sister and two 12 year old girls.  After the party the plan was to get pizza.  The only issue was our daughter's food allergies.  She needs gluten-free and vegan cheese.  We called downstairs to Fired Pie and we're delighted to learn that they had the vegan cheese!   Score!!  The service was great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So normally I love coming here, great environment, awesome food. But the visit that I am having right now is rather terrible. The younger group that works here is always courteous and fast. The two older women that are here right now have TERRIBLE attitudes and are completely rude! I believe the short haired blonde is the manager, and the way she is speaking to employees and customers as if they don't matter and just brushing them off is pissing me off. Terrible"}
{"text":"Foods great and the prices are out of this world. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars? Standing  in line  for 30 minutes is not something I'd do again, this place is BUSY.  FIRED PIE has so overgrown this tiny space it's the only drawback to an otherwise great establishment.  $7.95 for an 11\" pizza with fresh ingredients is ridiculous.  This might be the best dollar for dollar value establishment I've ever been to. I really can't stress that enough.  When Burger21 goes belly up in a few months jump on that space .  Great place."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza for the price! You can read my full review at: http://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/gluten-free-restaurant-review-fired-pie/"}
{"text":"Very quick service, and very friendly. The pizza tasted amazing! Very good crust, and a lot of variety for toppings. Love their Hawaiian BBQ, and it didn't take long for them to make at all! A perfect location if you're shopping nearby."}
{"text":"I really like this \"fast-pizza\" restaurant. Don't be mistaken though ... It does not taste like fast food.   Perfect for the location too; at the Tanger outlet shopping plaza.   I love that they offer a half sized salad option now. My daughter and I like different salads but we agree on the same pizza toppings - this way we can each have our choice of salad and we split a pizza.   This location seems a bit larger than the one I've been to before at the Deer Valley center.   Love the crust & they have a ton of topping options. The staff have always been pleasant and the place is clean."}
{"text":"If you are craving a pizza right now, stop what you're doing and go to Fired Pie. This place is genius. You walk in and can create your own pizza for $9. You pick as many toppings as you'd like, with no extra charge. On top of everything, it tastes amazing. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of movies at a nearby AMC theatre and I always noticed a line at this place, so after a show i decided to give it a try.. I walked in and there was a line but they were very efficient and they line moved quickly. When I got to the counter I was presented with so many choices it was hard to decide but I put my order in. The generosity with the toppings is amazing. I always drink water with my meal and i asked for a water cup and they gave me a regular full size cup, not like most place where they give you the smallest little cup they can find as to punish you for not buying a drink.. I barely sat down and my pizza was ready, it was incredible, one of the best thin crust pizzas I have ever had. It is now my favorite place to get a pizza and the price is very fair for what you get. They also have salads which I plan to try some time. My wife is on board with me on how good the pizza is.. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I have been to a few different Fired Pie locations including some of their competitors. This location however is new and extremely delicious. The people are very friendly and the atmosphere is really cool as it sits right up against a lake. I HIGHLY recommend getting the Hawaiian BBQ pizza but add some red onions for a nice crunch. My rating is bomb.com."}
{"text":"Well because Fired Pie decided to delete my original post, I am rating them even lower now. It's too bad because their pizza is delicious, but their customer service is awful. The employees are useless. I've been in there a few times and every time the tables are a mess and the bathroom is gross. They have so many employees standing around, typically talking rather than helping the customers. Hopefully, they'll change. I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This is a review based on quality of the pizza I achieved on UberEats! **   Now, I have seen fired pie  every time I commute on university and been waiting to go inside but just hasn't gotten the urge to actually attempt to walk in and enjoy the ambience of the restaurant. Anyways, were talking about the pizza am I right? And you can never ever go wrong with a bad pizza, and if you do, well you just won't here it from me. I chose Hawaiian cause I love pineapples and ham on my pizza and can't go wrong with that BBQ sauce cause it's awesome! Delivery was perfect so if you get the chance, make sure you try it and I'll for sure get the chance to stop in and actually dine in.  Stay hungry, Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had a mixup with the order but the customer service was phenomenal-Chris was very accommodating, cant wait to order from here again! Btw the gluten free crust is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! No matter how much I try to order something different I STILL can not get over the southwest salad.  Its HUGE (order for here not to go or its smaller) - The thing is like 2 or 3 meals and its delish!"}
{"text":"Will probably be the one and only time we visit this place. Staff inability to listen, and being told things ordered can't be ordered to go.(the cookie for 4)."}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars compared to other places that have a similar mechanism. Compared to restraint style pizza I have to rate as four. We received our pizzas in under 10 minutes! They allow you to half or quarter your pizzas to try different flavor combinations. They also have a large selection of ice teas. Also if you check in you can get a free pookie!"}
{"text":"This place had really good reviews so I decided to give it a try. However, upon entering the restaurant, I was disappointed to see that it was set up like a Subway for pizza. I thought it would have been more of a sit down restaurant. However, it was still decent, but I do think that the photos make the pizza look better than it actually was. Plus, the sauce was too salty and chunky for the weak thin crust. Not a good weight ratio, but it's okay. Still good for the low cost."}
{"text":"Awesome amazing service very helpful in building our own pizza (it was our 1st time) Matt came around to our table and was very friendly and courteous. I told my parents about the place and we will be back. Perfect for before or after a movie at Cinemark."}
{"text":"For semi fast food, this is an excellent choice. Yummy salads and pizza with super fresh ingredients. I found the staff to be friendly."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have a good experience even though the food isn't that good, because of the people. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. But My experience with fired pie was not so.  I was excited to go there because I've seen its reviews and it had many good ones and also because I looove pizza!! But the dude who took my order I think wasn't so happy to see me.. I had to repeat my order 2-3 times that means every single topping!  He wouldn't even greet or smile. The pizza was ok... so 3 rating is for the pizza alone. I apologize if I sounded to harsh or rude but that's the way it felt for me."}
{"text":"My pizza was good.   I love thin crust and crispyness so this was right up my alley.   The reason I'm taking away 1 star is that my fiance had a pizza and it was undercooked.   The toppings wernt all that warm and the crust wasn't cooked like mine.   Still good.   Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The employees here I must say I like their high energy and happy faces great customer service not to mention fast service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was not a good experience. The first time there was a long blonde hair in my pizza. The second time I was in line behind 3 other people, and I watched the employee who helped them fill their pizza with a ton of ingredients, which I was happy about because I thought awesome my pizza will be nice and flavorful, unlike last time. Then when it was my turn, another employee jumped on to help her so this other girl with super blonde hair ended up making my pizza instead. I wish she didn't. She BARELY put any ingredients on. She put such a small amount of cheese and spread it out as much as she could instead of just adding more. I then asked for salami and she only put FOUR small pieces on there. Seriously? After I paid, apparently the guy in line behind me saw the whole thing and actually came up to me and said \"you're way nicer than me, I would've complained and made her put way more ingredients or asked for the other girl to do my pizza.\" I definitely should've said something. It's too bad because the pizza is actually good when they aren't skimpy on the ingredients, and the employees are nice, but a hair in my food AND getting ripped off with barely any ingredients draws the line for me. Will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I was very impressed not only by the selection, but also the speed, and taste of the salad and pizza options here.  I visited this place twice within a week, once for salad, and the next time for pizza and both times I was very happy with my selections.  The pizza wait time was so quick!  They even have wine here, which makes everything better.  I like the build your own options and I appreciated the customer service and quality control.   Highly recommend this restaurant.  I will definitely be returning because there are a lot of pizzas I still need to try!"}
{"text":"Went back again for lunch and they have added lemon and limes  for  water. I really like this place"}
{"text":"Came in and ordered the margharita pizza with chicken.  I only ate one slice but 2-3 hours later I started feeling nauseous and then started well, ya know.  Not sure if the chicken was bad or if my tummy just didn't agree with the grease.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We were here last night and the pizza was good. The major complaint we have is they use their hands to grab the toppings from the containers. Yes they're gloved but the girl touched the pepperoni then the onions and then mushrooms. Mixing it all. Remnants of each toppings were everywhere. My boyfriend is vegetarian. While he was telling the girl which veggies he wanted, she was finger fuc$ing the pepperoni. Almost like it felt good. Weird. Why not have one girl doing meat and one doing veggies. Pretty simple. Geesh!"}
{"text":"We get 'to go' from this Fired Pie fairly frequently and other than on one occasion when they forgot one of the toppings (didn't notice until we got home), it has been first rate. I don't like to eat any other pizza."}
{"text":"I know there are tons of little fast food pizzerias popping up, but...GO TO THIS ONE. Here's why:   -Build your own pizza for like 8 bucks a pop.   -Build your own SALAD for the same price.   -They are always super fast, even when it's noon and the building is absolutely slammed with the pickiest, most indecisive bunch of yuppies you've ever seen.   I love switching it up every time I go. Buffalo sauce with fontina cheese? Scrumptious, even if a bit mild for my taste. BBQ sauce was even better. Their tried and true marinara rocks, especially the variety used for margherita pizzas.   This is going to be my go-to place in Midtown. Something reliable when you don't know what else to try. You just need to know one tip: Either order one of the specialties, or Order like a million toppings like everyone else does, since if you ask for just one or two, it will still be used rather sparingly. Bummer, as I like my pizzas simple, but at the price point you can have fun going overboard I guess. Still, I would recommend Fired Pie any day."}
{"text":"This my favorite place for pizza!  Fresh ingredients, great prices, friendly staff. Whenever I go there I finish a whole pizza my self,  its that good! I never order the same thing twice either because there is so many options!"}
{"text":"Love how you're able to build your own pizza! So many different toppings to choose from! I always get marinara with ham, pineapple, artichoke, mozzarella, corn, and drizzle of pesto. Wait time for you to get your pizza is literally less than 5-6 mins!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I can't support a restaurant where you have a food prep line and they don't change their gloves after every order. Sticking your hands in sausage, mushrooms and cheese then making my salad is not something I agree with. The food is good but from the way it is prepared I will never it here again."}
{"text":"THE PIZZA HERE IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!  My family and I eat here at least once a week.  The fact that we all like different pizza toppings and that we can each build our own pizzas is perfect!  The pies are definitely large enough to have leftovers if you're not starving.  The thin crust is always crisp and delicious and the toppings are always fresh and generous.  The staff are always up beat and very attentive to what toppings you want on the pie.  If you want more of any of the toppings that they put on there, just ask, they'll take care of it!  My only complaint here is that they can never seem to have enough cash in the drawer to make change.  Twice they've had to run to another nearby store to break whatever bill I give them.  I understand that debit/credit cards are 95% of transactions but people still do use cash from time to time.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR A BUILD YOUR OWN PIZZA ADVENTURE!  PS - THE BAKED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!"}
{"text":"First timer. Came in at 11:30. Line was to the door. First impression was clean. Atmosphere equals happy people. Ordered a pizza. I must say wow. For a thin crust pizza, this was outstanding.  I've been looking for a great pizza place. This one is up there. If there were one of these close to my house, I would eat here weekly. This is a must visit type of restaurant. Highly recommded. Nice job folks. Keep it up and build one in queen creek please."}
{"text":"I though got the pizza was decent for sure. It was run by a bunch of teens for the most part, but what do you expect for Tanger really?  Not that it was a bad thing, they were friendly and got the pizza out. Unfortunately the vegetables on the pizza made it a little soggy, I will definitely try other kinds first before I update my review."}
{"text":"I am so bummed!  Used to love this place.  Don't know what happened!  My favorite salad had FROZEN LETTUCE!  Bathroom's in disrepair...filthy.  Music blasting.  Staff standing around.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"It's a well known fact in my office that if you eat a whole pizza from here, you won't be coming to work the next day. This place made me sick. I have a fired pie hangover right now."}
{"text":"Immature kids working the front.. It was about quarter to 9 pm, I seen they were half cleaning but still making other people some pizzas . As I walked up to place an order, the young guy at the register kinda made a pouty dissappoitned noise and told the girl to stop cleaning because someone else just walked up. I just said no I'm OK thanks anyways and just went somewhere else completely to eat where I didn't feel like a hassel. I thought it closed at 9 pm but I guess I was wrong . I will never try to attempt to eat there again ."}
{"text":"For $8, Fired Pie serves up some pretty good pizza.  I stopped for lunch because they were right next door to the nail salon. I mean, who doesn't like build-your-own pizza, right?  I picked traditional tomato sauce, spicy sausage, artichokes and spinach and honestly, thought it was very, very good. Their crust is superior to my build-a-pizza place at home (Blaze) - it's super thin and perfectly crunchy.   The guys working here couldn't have been any nicer - probably the nicest \"fast food\" type service I've had in a long time. One of the staffers even gave me a recommend to his favorite local tea shop, so that's pretty cool.  Also, all of their \"to-go\" boxes have the phrase \"You're Fired!\" printed on them. I thought that was both funny and topical (probably unintentionally)."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service and the most disgusting restaurant I have ever been to. If you like your food cross contaminated, burnt, and handled improperly, you'll love this place. NOT. Just a bunch of teenagers running the place and have no respect for the customer. Driving to another location is definitely worth it. Myself, my friends, and my family are forever boycotting this location due to the several bad experiences we have all had. I even contacted the manager about the severity of the last incident, and he said he would call me back and never did."}
{"text":"Pick one of their creations or invent your own custom 11 inch pie!  This place is new in town.  Great little concept (think Subway, but pizza and salad) in the Park Central Mall in Phoenix.  Not a big sign out front but near Starbucks and The Good Egg.  Close to home so stopped in last night for take-out.  It doesn't take long for the pizza to cook (thin, crispy crust).  My pesto chicken pizza was excellent.  Hubs steak and blue pizza rocked as well.  We shared a steak and blue salad with balsamic dressing and it was also very good.  Good portion of romaine, thin sliced steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers and Gorgonzola.  You can add anything else you want as well.  Glad this place is near when I need salad or personal pizzas."}
{"text":"Came here after a long trip back from California! I e live down the street and finally decided to come here. We were surprised with how fast the food came out and how yummy the pizzas were. You really cannot screw up in a place like this it's impossible! You order them what to put on the pizza and they simply bake it and bring it over. Also, the employees were very friendly and welcoming. Will be here more often!!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick personal and custom pizza! Sauce is okay.. but overall the pizza is good. Also, their gluten free crust is a pretty yummy for only $2 more."}
{"text":"A new pizza concept.  You can now get a pizza made at Fired Pie just like they make burritos at Chipotle.  You get your pick of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings (or pick one of their set recipes).  Once your order is in, you sit down and get your pie in a matter of minutes (even when the place is crowded).  Taste?  Easily better than a lot of pizza joints out there.  Pies are only individual size-- 11 inches, but that will fill you up nice.  I even tried a piece of their gluten-free crust at one point and found it of surprisingly good taste and body.  The decor is hip, quite unlike the funky industrial shop vibe at Chipotle.  Yes, it's loud, but you'll have too much fun eating your delicious pizza to care.  It's a great, fast, lunch, dinner, or substantial snack.  Next time you're hungry, head out to Fired Pie and experience the flavor of this great new spot."}
{"text":"First experience- last night. Came in about 8:00 PM had a large group. Line was average considering how many people we had and seemed to move fairly quickly. Set up is similar to a sandwich shop such as Subway. It starts with you getting your fresh dough. Then,  they take it down an assembly line of sauces and topping to your liking. After being rung up, they take your name and deliver your pie when it's done. It cooked in a large very hot wood fire oven! Not a long wait for a bubbling, baked delicious pie! Crust is light, flaky and very tasty. A positive- good pizza, customer service was friendly and fast. Con's- Pricey: 2 11\" pizzas (pies) 1 large Caesar  Salad ( split) 1 soda ( other drink was tap water) Total $26.00. * When you pay near the end of your transaction it automatically suggests gratuity options* 15%, 20%, OR 30%. Make sure that you hit the \"Other Option\" so that you can pay what you feel is fair for your experience. I ended up paying 15% as we had a large party and felt the service was sufficient."}
{"text":"I initially tried Fired Pie on Veteran's day. My husband and I are Marine veterans, and Fired Pie was giving out a free pizza or salad for veterans. We arrived around 5:30 and it was really busy. The cashier told me that they had been opened for three days, so they were working out the kinks. We ordered our ow pizzas and got them for free, score! The ordering process is similar to Chipotles ( you tell the person what items you want on the item you are getting). The pizza was delicious, and was great the next day for lunch. We have been back since then and it is consistently scrumptious. The crust is crunchy and thin and the variety of sauces is great.I recommend trying  Fired Pie when visiting the area. It's $7.95 for a good quality pizza, which is a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is such a cool concept and I'm sad I didn't think of it first! Think Chipotle or Subway but better because it's with pizza. The personal pizzas are enough to fill me up and I'm a sucker for any place that has Pepsi!"}
{"text":"My favorite kind of pizza is Neapolitan pizza/new American or thinner crust. Since my favorite pizza place is far away from me, fired pie is definitely my go to. What I like about Fired Pie is that they have unlimited toppings and the pizzas are customizable. (pineapples belong on pizza btw!). I also love their customizable salads. I always get some field greens, feta cheese, craisins, and pour raspberry vinaigrette over my salad.  The picture I posted: Salad is the valley field greens   Pizzas are customs the first one is alfredo sauce, chicken, spinach bacon.  Tip: they have gluten free options for those that are gluten free or have celiac :-)"}
{"text":"Chipotle for pizza, exceeded my expectations. The people were extremely friendly and I got my pizza in less than ten minutes. I have a gluten intolerance and the gluten free crust is AMAZING! They were extremely caring about changing their gloves and didn't seem annoyed that there was a change in their usual routine. It wasn't the best pizza I have ever eaten but it was very tasty! Ten dollars and unlimited topping, yessss. Will be coming back...."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for awhile and got my chance to a few days ago. Love the concept and the friendliness of the staff. She was really patient with us since this was our first time.   So many sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies and fresh herbs. The choices makes your head spin so just take a deep breath and go for it cause it's all you want on this 11 inch pizza. Best part it's only $8.59 including taxes.   They have the dough already for you and you just pick, pick and pick. I had the tomato and buffalo sauce with meatball, sausage and some veggies. Actually I forgot what I put on it and went a little crazy.   It was a nice thin crust pizza with a nice little kick to the pizza with the buffalo sauce. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was actually good. I was able to gobble the whole thing without stuffing myself. My daughter was able to eat her whole pizza too.   Not a bad place to pick up a quick pizza. They even have salads if you like.   Overall, I thought that the service was very friendly and patient, fresh ingredients, and good pizza. Love the custom made pizza without the extra charges. Nice change of pace where everyone is trying to nickel and dime you every time. I enjoyed it and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This fast-casual counter serve restaurant achieves the optimal intersection of value, quality, portion size, and convenience. The ingredients are fresh, and they are generous with both pizza and salad toppings. The price is very fair, and they don't even charge extra for premium ingredients like at many other chains. There is also always plenty of access to parking, even when they are busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"Great idea! Fast food with quality ingredients. Make you own personal pizza and salad assembly line. Pizzas come out fast and crispy- love the thin crust! Also they have quite a few different iced teas to try which is nice. You can get a great meal for about $10- $15?"}
{"text":"Way better than I expected when I heard \"all the toppings you want for no charge\". In fact, it was out right delicious!"}
{"text":"I love pizza, so building my own with tons of different ingredient options at 1 price is perfect for me. The crust is thin an crisp. I love the large build your own salads! The employees are friendly and helpful. Fired Pie is one of my go to places for a filling meal! A lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place cause I choose all the toppings I love.  It is always perfectly cooked With thin crust. The China Mist ice tea is Delish! It's hard not to have a \"Pookie\" for dessert cause the are yummy good.  Great staff too!"}
{"text":"For the price you can't get a better custom pizza.  As many toppings as you want and some craft beer.  Les than $15 and you can eat your fill with an IPA!"}
{"text":"Hail to the fired pizza pie! $7.99 to build-your-own or pick a pizza. They pop it into the fire hot oven and it cooks within minutes. This is like Subway, pick any and as many toppings you want! It's really very good, enough that I keep eating here every week. Lol!   They also have salads too.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The wait wasn't too bad. The pizza is so much better than the national fast food pizza chains by far!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a place where you can build your own personal pizza?? They have a great selection of toppings, and even pre-built options. The pizza is good if you like thin crust! The concept is awesome; but the one thing that kind of turns me off about the place is that EVERY TIME I've been here- when you are standing in line to order, the work area floor is a MESS. I get it, small work place with tons of workers building pizzas-and a fast paced atmosphere; but if you are going to have the ability for your customers to see how things are cooked they should definitely be more aware of the cleanliness of the area. Other than that the place is great, foods great and the workers are always outgoing and pleasant."}
{"text":"Good food 4/5 times, but crap staff 5/5 times. All teenagers that wear whatever they want it seems. I've seen short shorts and flip flops. In a kitchen. What?! There's never a manager up front and it shows. Hopefully someone from management will take charge soon."}
{"text":"Great pie at a good price!  Nice friendly employees too.  Love the crust and toppings and the pie comes out fast"}
{"text":"I had a Steak and Blue pizza along with a Southwest Chicken salad.  I really liked the salad and the pizza was okay.  Like many said the sun coming in the west facing window was definitely a distraction.  People had filled up every seat not in the sun and 80% of the tables were empty because of the sun.  I assume they have to have shades on order. Compared to their nearby competitor with the same concept they seemed inefficient, some of this is due to their recent opening but some is built in.  The employees constructing my pizza and salad were straining to see the menu boards to decide what to add to each dish.  The menu boards are easily visible from the line but are angled away from the ingredient line.  There should also be a menu board behind them to assist the customer.  The salad bowls are nice looking but are unstable and the exteriior pick up flour and various ingredient chunks as they are pushed down the line.  Maybe assemble in a different bowl and put into nice bowls at the end?   I would come here if I wanted a salad and go to the other place if I wanted a build your own pizza.  Neither pizza is good as a regular pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great fast way to get a great pizza pie. But needs more work with employees not smiling. Smile people smile it goes along way."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and salad! Perfect portion for two people before the Suns game. You can build your own pizza or salad or choose from one of their speciality combinations. We choose half pesto chicken and the other half we customized. The Italian salad had great portions of the Italian meat. Very satisfied with this restaurant and will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"The made-to-order thin crust pizza is a \"thing\" now. I first saw it in Vegas at Project Pie and 800-Degrees, and now Fired Pie and MOD Pizza are out here in the Valley. They all even have the system where your order is marked on the wax paper that your pizza is delivered on. I don't know who was first and who is the clone - possibly none of the ones I've mentioned!  But that isn't really the point, is it? No, the point is to review Fired Pie in particular. I give them a solid 4-stars. I like the variety of toppings and the generosity with applying them. This can backfire a bit because too many toppings can cause crust not to crisp up, or for the toppings not to heat up in proportion to the crust.  The price is reasonable and on par with the competition. If you just want a basic pepperoni, you might as well go to Venezia's and pay $12 for a 16\" pie, but Fired Pie is for the adventure and the variety."}
{"text":"I feel like I've reviewed a lot of these choose-your-own-adventure pizza shops. In short, for Gilbert I say Fired Pie is better than MOD Pizza down the street. But their sauce doesn't have a lot of flavor, so it isn't as good as MyPie over on Gilbert Rd. I really like Fired Pie's recommended pizza options. Obviously you don't have to follow them but for first timers you can't go wrong with those as starting points. Their meatlovers is the best around I'd say - they have capocollo! But it would be nice to see ricotta to do a white pie (did my New Jersey just slip out?)."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle/Qdoba/Subway/etc. meets pizza, and the results are not surprisingly delicious. You can't really go wrong--I like to start with one of their prebuilt pizzas and then customize it. I don't really trust myself with the raw power of building one from scratch; I'd abuse the authority. I do, however, allow myself the freedom of throwing some salty, briney, delicious kalamata olives on whatever the hell I'm having them build. As the wise woman once said: \"Lay off me, for I am starving!\""}
{"text":"They were so good! Every one was so nice we took our whole group from work here. Zac was awesome and everyone else too! Def will be back."}
{"text":"Fired pie was okay. Nothing great, but nothing bad. The staff was really nice and polite. The place was nice and clean. I'm not a big fan that they carry Pepsi products over coke, but that's just a personal preference. The mushrooms were kind of gross to me. Definitely looked old. And I was more than bummed that they don't carry green bell peppers. Overall, not a bad experience, but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Here's what I didn't like, Gorgonzola cheese on my pizza.  Now, here's what I loved: * customize your own pizza * thin pizzas perfect for lunch * 4 flavors of iced tea * patio seating in the shade * I could TRY Gorgonzola on just a small part of my pizza  Here's the thing, I don't care for Gorgonzola cheese on my pizza, but I didn't have to waste an entire pizza on it. I can try 4 different cheeses and 15 different toppings, a few different sauces and oils and probably (I haven't asked) all on different portions of the same pie!!  I'm not going to do it, so let me know if YOU do."}
{"text":"Service was great, the place was clean, and the food came out fast. The only thing that give this such a low rating was the taste. it tasted almost exactly like a tostinos frozen pizza. and for 8+ dollars i expected quite a bit more.  The girls working there did a great job preparing it, but the flavor was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Definitely great pizza. Love the thin crust and that I can make it my own. I usually get it with the garlic and oil as my sauce and whatever I want as toppings. One of these days I will try their salad. I promise."}
{"text":"Really like this place, subway of pizza joints. If you like to customize, and then have completely control over your pizza, this is where you need to go. If they aren't doing it right, tell them to re-do it! However, I have always had great service and speedy wait times, so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from the Avondale location usually like their food but tonight my wife and I shared the pizza and salad and we both have been sick since. Called asked to speak with mgr was told she just left, girl on phone was very unprofessional and made me feel like an idiot. Not very happy. Well Fred, not sure how to reply to your comment so ill do it here. Yes we placed our order and received it between 430 and 730 at starting at about seven 730 is when we both started getting sick neither one of us have eaten the same food at all yesterday till that meal. I gave my name and my phone number to the supervisor that took my call last night and here it is 135 in the afternoon and as of yet by this time no one has contacted me by phone"}
{"text":"Great way to start the new year!! Pizza!! An 11 inch personal pizza with whatever toppings you can imagine, no limit for $7.95! First time there and a great find here in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place one star, due to the manager's horrible customer service. I have to be downtown for a workshop and was excited to go to Fired Pie because I have gluten allergies and they have a delicious gluten free crust.   The place was busy, I get that, but the manager was extremely rude. I asked if they could just scrape the little area where they cook my pizza, I wasn't asking them to clean the whole stove. The manager said, \"Ma'am, you can get a gluten free crust but we are not going to clean the grill with this crowd.\" I said, \"I'm not asking you to. I just need the small part where you cook my pizza, scraped. That's all.\" She huffed around and I said I'd just have to get the salad, I guess. When I asked if the salads were gluten free (crazy that some aren't) she replied with, \"Obviously, it depends on which one you get.\"   Um...obviously, which is why I asked. I decided to just leave and walked all the way to China Chile, who happily accommodated me.   I don't know anyone who would choose a gluten free crust, if she did not have allergies. It is not like regular crust, but I was so excited to be able to have pizza. My experience was ruined and I will never be back to the Central Phoenix location. The Westgate location is much more friendly, and knowledgeable. If you are going to run a restaurant, know your product. If she would have apologized and been at least an ounce of civil toward me, I would have understood.  The only saving grace was the super nice young man who was trying to help me and apologized. He deserves to be promoted to manager. Sadly, I did not get his name, but he at least saved me from total disappointment.   I believe in giving credit where credit is due...and also where it is not due. You missed the mark, Fired Pie. :-(   *****Addendum: One of the co-owner's contacted me and apologized, telling me he has reviewed policies with the manager. I could have had my pizza cooked on a tin, which was not offered to me.   It is so nice to have someone take enough care to try and remedy a negative situation. He informed me that he will send me a coupon for a free pizza. I don't think I'll be back to that location, but it certainly is a nice gesture."}
{"text":"This the problem when you have a bunch of kids working the store I show up about 8:55, granite they close at 9:00 but I asked if they can make me a quick pizza and they all stared at each other like they where lost, poor customer service, they start shutting down at 8:30 apparently, it would have taken them 3 minutes but again leave the fort to kids that don't care. Bad idea!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! My co-worker swears by it and took me here today. I was extremely satisfied with everything! The people who work there are nice and move quickly and efficiently, which is nice to see every once and a while.   I got the Steak and Blue with added artichokes, best food decision that I've made in quite some time!  I highly recommend it everyone who wants to add yet another fantastic food place to their list!"}
{"text":"I love this place and always bring friends and family in! I'm a big fan of the \"create your own\" concept and the fact that there's no limit on the ingredients you can put on the pizza. Quick service. The pizza is always delicious too. The only thing knocking their fifth star is they're a bit stingy. I like to put a bunch of ingredients so it doesn't typically bother me. However, last time I was there I brought a friend and he was almost done with his whole pizza when the manager came and asked us how it was then questioned why my friend asked for a box if he was going to waste it since he was practically done with his pizza. He said he didn't ask for a box... because he didn't (they gave it to him in a box without asking) so that was a little intrusive and rude to assume and judge. The pizza does taste delicious though!! Just make sure you don't get a box unless you want the manager trying to guilt you about it."}
{"text":"I like that you can pick as many toppings as you want for the same price. 4 stars because it seems like they rarely clean the bottom of the pizza oven so the bottom of your pizza is usually black and ashy from the fire"}
{"text":"Always perfect! !! Soooooo much better than pieology and staff are very friendly, and of course food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  It's simple, it's cheap and its quick. If thin crust pizza is your thing, you better go on in there.  The ingredients they use are quality and the pizza always comes out tasting absolutely delicious. I have never had a mediocre experience here."}
{"text":"When I was trying to decide what to eat I saw this place with good reviews.  I scrolled through the pictures and saw a pizza that looked too good not to get. The staff was extra friendly and my pizza was amazing. It is nice being able to choose what you want and watch them put generous amounts of toppings on the pie. They do not short you on the goods like at chipotle. Definitely recommend if you like thin crust and creating your own pizza."}
{"text":"It really doesn't get any better than getting a whole 8 inch pizza with unlimited toppings for only $8.  My boyfriend and I shared one pizza and we were both satisfied.  We got: pesto and garlic and oil fresh mozzarella and fontina cheese meatball, capicola, and sausage mushrooms, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes  The pizza was delicious! The crust is cooked perfectly thin and crispy. We topped our pizza with a lot of things so we had to be a bit more careful about picking up the slices to eat it, but the number of toppings didn't affect the crispiness of the crust which I liked a lot.  I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I'm starting to be concerned with how often I crave this place. Everything I've tried has been fantastic. The pesto chicken pizza (added mushrooms and artichokes) and hawaiian BBQ pizza are my favorites, and the spicy southwest salad is great as well. Boyfriend always gets the meaty Italian pizza, and maybe one of these days he'll let me try a bite before he devours it. The service is great - even when it's busy (which is often), it moves fast and everyone is friendly. Reasonably priced too. I can't wait to bring my mom here next time she's in town."}
{"text":"This place was great! Super speedy service, everyone there is super efficient. The pizza was fairly priced. Plenty of seating. And the pizza was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Always good, always generous with toppings, always worth it! Great fresh fired pizza. I love making a meaty Mediterranean with fresh mozzarella, salami, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, caramelizedbonions and roasted peppers and don't forget he capicola ham. Simply some of the best pizza in town your way."}
{"text":"I would love to say more, but this place closed down before its posted times. We walked in and the chairs were up and food all put away. Hey offered to still make the pizza, but we just went elsewhere. We loved Fired Pie Downtown, it's just ridiculous to close early when you are in an established shopping area. We drove 20 minutes to get there."}
{"text":"Really liked it! Totally different than I expected. Pizza was super good and very thin so I didn't feel gross after eating it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch date. Price is right. The pizza is order and go. Takes only 6 minutes to bake. Great crust."}
{"text":"Ive been to fired pie a few times in the past, this was my first time to this location and it was a great experience! The lake view is so pretty! The staff was very friendly. This cute little blonde girl helped me at the register and she was so nice and helpful. And my pizza was great! I got just a plain pepperoni, wasn't feeling adventurous, but it was delicious. I will definitely be back to this one."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of going to fired Pie with my friend Zack last week. The menu is a little bit confusing but once I figured out what was going on it was cool. Slightly burnt around the edges which is why this is not getting a full five stars. Getting to pick whatever toppings I wanted at no extra charge was absolutely astounding. All the ingredients are very fresh and very tasty. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is extremely good! Time and time again I return and find the quality is always great. The employees are fast and friendly. Can be a long wait during a rush but it is definitely worth it. The ability to truly customize your pizza however you want it is incredible. Would recommend for everyone to try.   TL;DR: Food is outstanding. Not much more to say."}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover like most people! And like like people who eat pizza they feel a bit guilty after eating it, but not here!!! I never ever feel guilty eating a whole pie to myself (& I do, every time I eat here). The staff is okay, they are friendly for the most part, the location is good too. The food though, omg the food is amazing!!!! Salads to pizza is da bomb!!  & they also support the troops, so don't hesitate to ask!"}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The place was pretty clean and industrial looking.  Ordered 4 pizzas for the family and everything was delicious. Couldn't have been better. My twins are very picky when it comes to pizza and they devoured it.   The drink machine was a bit of a let down. But, it could be low on a few flavors.  Other then that, I look forward to returning and enjoying some more pizza."}
{"text":"LOVE this Pizza Place!!!  Gluten Free pizza is awesome, regular is good too, but, I really liked the GF.  Bri is a GREAT Manager, and runs it very well.  It's clean, simple, love the Graffitti Wall and fence, reminds me of NY!  It would be a great addition to ASU's Campus in Tempe.  Who wouldn't love an individual pizza, that cooks quickly on campus!!!  What a concept!!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the family and we were blown away at how amazing it was! Everything was so fresh and delicious, my kids are very picky eaters and they loved their pizzas! We are going back tomorrow because it was so good! Great service as well, manager was extremely polite and kind!"}
{"text":"We received great service. My grandson had celiac disease so we have to avoid gluten. The staff changed their food service gloves before preparing his pie and baked it separately. He is usually disappointed in the gluten free options but loved his pizza. I ordered the field greens and roasted veggie salad and thought it was excellent. We ate outside and even though the outdoor dining is off the parking lot it is also by a lake, so it was really pleasant."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and friendly people. Quick through the line and willing to roll with any request for toppings."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Pricing is almost impossible to beat. Went for the first time tonight and you can bet your ass I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really love Fired Pie. The pizzas are great, I can get exactly what I want and, well, I just love pizza.  But, you know what I don't love? Disrespect  We were there on a Saturday night. Everything was great until we get to the register to pay. That's when I see him, Douchy McDouchebag. How does he greet me?  \"How ya doin' my man?\"  My man? Excuuuuse me?   Really? THAT's how you address your paying customers?   I was polite and paid him...I even said thank you. Even still, this loser was able to get one more \"my man\" greeting out before I could escape.   Of course, he didn't give me our cups for drinks so I unfortunately had to interact with him one more time. Thankfully he didn't have a chance to go all ghetto on me again.  My advice to the manager:  Train your people Monitor the interactions Re-adjust Repeat"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food is great. $11.00 buys a whole pizza and large drink. The ingredients are fresh and taste so good. The kids that work here are quite helpful and courteous. Definitely recommend trying fired pie."}
{"text":"Very tasty, fast, and reasonably priced. I've had better pizzas before, but nowhere have I had such great pizza for such a reasonable price. The wait time is very short as well."}
{"text":"Crust is thin, kindof like a flatbread pizza.  Slightly burnt edges.  Overall this felt like something I could've made at home.  It's alright and convienant, wouldn't really go back...  Not my style of pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh from the oven thin crust pizza pies as you request & bangin' Bellinis? Yes please!! Super friendly & efficient service? Thank you!! Was quiet when mom & I were there.  The steak & blue was fantastic & awesome with the garlic powder! Great idea :-) will be back for the BBQ Hawaiian for sure! Put some bacon on it for me!!"}
{"text":"Coming from a long day at Comicon, I was fucking hungry. There was a lengthy line, but Comicon brings buisness so it's understandable. The pizza ladies were friendly and quick to take our orders and give my friends and I our personal pizzas. Overall, there was no bullshit. DECENT."}
{"text":"First time here and it was so fun AZ and tasty!  Long line around 12:30 pm but the pizzas came out fast.  Good price for what you get.  Lots of great ingredients.  Loved the pesto and sausage.  The whole idea is neat.  Some staff members could be a bit more into their job.  Other workers were awesome.  Will be back because they are so fresh, and fast."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent, staff and restaurant seemed disorganized and aloof. They need to work some kinks out if they want to be considered the \"chipotle of pizza\". I'm actually surprised they've been successful enough to have multiple locations. I hope they work out the issues because it's a good idea."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic prices!!! Gluten free and regular for under 10$ is unbelievable! They have sooo many toppings. The combinations are yummy! Servers were so fun. I would go there any time."}
{"text":"Best salads and pizzas out there. Love how many options they offer. Probably eat here weekly! Never too busy when I go in which is always good. Either take home or dine in your always satisfied."}
{"text":"The customer service is awful. I asked for ranch on my pizza and the girl hardly put any. Their lemonade tastes nasty and mod is so much better 0/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Great new place to make your own pizza pie. Start out w a 11\" personal thin crust pizza and add unlimited amount of toppings for the same price. Think chipolte or Subway but for pizza.  Everyone in our family customized our pizza and we even had leftovers to boot! Salads are the same way. You can create your own or choose one of their suggestions.  Pizzas are fired in a brick oven. Staff is friendly and helpful if it's your first time. Be creative and try making your own concoction!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is always smiling and friendly (and they don't give you \"the look\" when you ask for \"a little more mushrooms please?\")  It probably helps that I'm picking out every single item for my personalized taste, but I always have a pleasant experience here! The fact that they serve beer and wine always a thumbs up too :)"}
{"text":"Food is good..But employee attire could use some improvement. Daisy dukes on the job shouldn't be allowed and I am talking SUPER short..One more inch and she'd need to wax..glad she didn't make my pizza.."}
{"text":"Great service with GF options. Change of gloves and a cross contamination warning. Super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great prices, large pies and quality ingredients. It was a quick meal and filling enough to make two meals for me. I would definitely go again.   I would have liked fresh basil leaves over the dried ones, if I had to change one thing."}
{"text":"Whats not to love about this place.  Great pizza - you can create your own....with as many toppings that you want.  They also have great signature pizza's....and the salads are huge and you can also put whatever you like on them.  And for only 8 bucks - why wouldnt you want to eat here.  You must check them out.  I am here at least once a week.  Oh and the staff are also great."}
{"text":"Great concept with great food.  I love thin crust pizza and both the crust and sauce are excellent.  Food made fresh daily.  Great service. Owner has vast experience in the pizza business.  Can't wait for a Scottsdale location to open."}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best pizza in my opinion. You pick what you want and how much you want. Get your hunger satisfaction in minutes. It always amazes me how quick your food is ready. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Seriously.  Even my husband, the pickiest eater EVER, has switched from his usual Papa Murphys to Fired Pie to create his own pizzas (yes, plural).  Fired Pie's thin, flatbread crust is delicious and I love the variety of meats, cheeses and toppings. I feel you can indulge a little here without the guilt from other pizza places.  Good price at $8 and a new staple for me and the hubs for the occasional UFC fight night!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. It is like a Chipotle but for pizza. Choose your toppings, get the pie made, everything is one standard price.  The crust is great, but what really does it is the sauce. The pizza sauce is amazing.   Go here! if you haven't already.. Go here! And you will feel like a pizza artist, just making your custom pizzas and smiling away!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a quick bite while shopping on this side of town and found Fired Pie to have exactly what we wanted. A great salad  and an awesome customizable pizza. We were really impressed with not only the food from this casual/fast food type of place but also the employees were great. For example, it was a weekday and it was about 3ish with only another diner in the restaurant. When we walked in, the employees greeted us right away and explained how things are done (as we are new to the area and had never heard of Fired Pie). Right away we placed our order and the whole time the employees genuinely smiled and seemed happy to be there, very refreshing as this is not always the case when eating at fast food/casual dining establishments. They even passed by a couple times while they tidied up the place and asked if we needed anything. After we left I made a note to bookmark this place to review and also find one closer to home. I can see now they all have about 4-5 stars consistently across the board. Fired Pie you are doing it right and hiring the right people. We are now going to visit Fired Pie whenever in the mood for a good pizza and/or salad. Love everything you've got to offer, THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"For what it is this place is really awesome. It's a build your own pizza joint like the chipolte of pizza. Any toppings you want on a pizza large enough to share -unless your starving - for like 8 bucks. Let me say that again UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. You want a five cheese pizza with twelve meats and enough veggies on it to choke a cow they will make it with a smile. Word to the wise though I have actually done this and sometimes less is more. Too many topping can make the toppings to dough ratio kind of silly and turn your pizza in to more of a goofy tostada. These days I keep it pretty simple. The pizza is of excellent quality I prefer it to most delivery or restaurant places. It's thin crust only I believe although they also have gluten free. Its even fast - pizzas are made to order in about five minutes. The salads are great too you can order them from a menu or my preferred way which is ordering them exactly as I want - unlimited toppings same as the pizza and unlike with the pizza I really do go crazy on the salad toppings - the more the merrier!"}
{"text":"The final product always tastes great, but the process for making the pizza or salad is quite frustrating! This place has about 7 teenagers shoved in a very small space behind the counter making our order fresh, which fresh is awesome! The problem is that I have to repeat my order about 4 times to 4 different workers to make my pizza or salad. The most frustrating part is having to repeat my order, usually twice, to the cashier, who almost always is flustered and is confused as to which items are in our order. I always make sure to order drinks, but half the time the drinks get left off and I have to order them on a separate tab. Not a big deal, but annoying. This place is also above average noisy, which I think is why the cashier is so flustered and may not be able to hear customers. Great food but terrible execution."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!! My sister told me for months to try Fired Pie...I finally did and this is the best little thin crust pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"5 Stars all the way.  Helpful staff, friendly environment, and  delicious pies.  What more could you ask for.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Super quick and I like how I can out whatever I want on a pizza and watch them make it right in front of me. Staff is always pleasant and I like their lemonade. Lol"}
{"text":"These things are delicious. 11 inch pizza pie made in just a few minutes and with the speed of a custom burrito at places like Qdoba or Chipotle.   Honestly, best meal I had on my vacation (including the $36 NY strip). These personal pizzas are about 8-10 bucks. Succulent!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered ended up super tasty good! I would definitely come back again! (: my friends say they come here every Friday so I'm going to start joining them every Friday. I'm thinking about bringing my boyfriend here for a date sometime."}
{"text":"Very good and a very fun idea! I normally keep it basic with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, hot sausage, and black olives. You can put as much as you'd like on it though. The staff are also very nice and very laid back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but no military discount!! You can have the same thing at Mod Pizza less than a mile away and get 20% discount."}
{"text":"So good one of my favorite places for sure. The price can't be beat that's for sure but for the price you would expect mediocre pizza however this happens to be my favorite pizza hands down it is amazing pizza and quality and it's awesome you can load it up with as many toppings as you want for free I love the salads as well"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very good, and ingredients are fresh, but there is always trash on the ground when I come in here. Either in the form of unclean tables, food all over the floor, or a huge trash bag leaking questionable fluids all over the sidewalk by the front door (talk about inviting for customers!). I like their pizzas, but the place always seem to be run by high school age students and customer service is usually not good. Maybe if they had a supervisor on scene more often or just worked to keep the place clean, I would bump up my review to 4+ stars."}
{"text":"We arrived during lunch and it was packed! The line moved fairly quickly though.  My friend has a gluten intolerance. So upon arriving to order the lady asked her if she had allergies to gluten and she said yes. They took their gloves off and put new ones on. AMAZING. Now THAT'S customer service. I was very impressed with the level of professional and caring attention they expressed. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Walked in on a Saturday and it was empty so we did not have to wait. They roast their own mushrooms and sautee their cooked onions. Both were delicious toppings on the pizzas. They serve beer and wine, but sadly also serve Pepsi products. That's why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. I was told to leave in the middle of my meal because they saw I had a vape pen. That's fair if they want to do that, but I just want to warn others that they are pro-cancer and there are better places to eat."}
{"text":"The Pizza and the service including the ice-cold beer was outstanding!  David and his crew did a great job!  This would become my Mainstay for pizza however I am very disappointed that they will not put on the television for the enjoyment of the customer!  I came here assuming I would be able to see the kickoff of the Sunday night game and the TV remote is not on site completely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"First time in after hearing good things about this place. I had a good salad at a very good price with excellent service. Salads and pizza are made to order, so you get what you want."}
{"text":"I am all about being able to customize my order without upsetting a waiter and this custom pizza ordering style place has become an instant favorite.  The first time I went here I topped my pie with almost every veggie they had and it turned out amazing. Which is sometimes hard to do when you put a lot of veggies on a pizza. They don't skimp you with topping either, this personal sized pizza will fill you up. The thin crust style is perfect in regards to taste and crunchiness.   The second time I came here I decided to try out a salad. Again, I could completely customize it with their buffet style ordering line, and no surprise it was delicious as well, and the size made it very filling.  I think the best thing to do here is go with someone else, one person order a pizza, one a salad and you split it. Best of both worlds in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted a quick lunch today. He had told me about 1,000 Degrees, but I wanted to try something new. They are both similar concepts, but I have never tried Fired Pie so Fired Pie it was  We started with one of their standard pies and added some protein. We also went with one of their salads. Both were delicious, the service was quick and staff was very friendly. Great choice for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place is quick and tasty.  Great for dining in or to go.  This location is under construction right now but staying open."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious! The pizza is made right in front of you and for unlimited toppings you pay the same price as someone who just gets cheese. The pizza comes out hot in like 5 minutes. If you check in on Yelp, they'll give you a free Pookie which is a warm cookie freshly baked topped with vanilla ice cream. Staff is very friendly and location is convenient."}
{"text":"Clean store, friendly staff, huge variety of items are the main reason I love this Fired Pie. I love all Fired Pies I've been to by the way. They have gluten free crust for $2 extra and ranch is free. They serve thin crust pizza that is prepared in front of you and ready in minutes. You can get whatever you on your pizza and the price is the same. Same rules apply if you want a salad. For drinks, they serve Pepsi, lemonade and different flavors of tea. Pizza is brought out to your table you just gotta make sure to throw your trash away."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Oh yeah and pizza is scrumptious! Always a delightful experience."}
{"text":"after getting a email from yelp to check this place out. my wife and i did and it was great food and fast service."}
{"text":"Triple amazing: pizza, salad and spirits!!! Pizza is just large enough for two OR take home and enjoy later, by far the BEST day old pizza I ever heated up.  We will definitely stop by again to try some of the other cool creative pizzas on the menu....Staff was SUPER FRIENDLY, made the experience that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Tasty place! My coworkers picked this place out for lunch recently, and I'm always down to try (like always), a place where i'd never eaten.  $8 gets you an 11\" pie with pre-selected ingredients, or choose-your-own-ingredients. Although the pre-selected veggie and meat pizzas sounded good, I went ahead and choose my own toppings just as my coworkers did. One gal even did half tomato sauce/half pesto! It's a fairly simple process- wait in line, tell one employee what sauce/dough you want, another what cheese you want, etc etc... Just like Subway!  In a few minutes time wait while the pie cooks, be sure to grab a table. Those are in short supply during the lunch hour. The amount of toppings and sauce are perfect, and I love the thin crust! The crust would be even better if it was crispier/more firm so the toppings would stay in place. Cannot wait to eat at this place in the future."}
{"text":"Got a pizza to go with tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, meatball, and oregano. It was a bit crispier than I prefer so the dogs got to help me with some crust. The pepperoni also tasted a little \"off\" to me. Not the best pizza I've had there... but I know they can do better."}
{"text":"Tried Fired Pie yesterday for lunch and I liked it! It was very busy and most tables were occupied. I thought that made sense since there are very few food options at Tanger. The girls behind the counter were busy prepping other orders and took a little while to acknowledge us. For my pizza I got the tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, and meatball. I think the girl seemed annoyed when I asked her to pick off the tiny piece of green lettuce that ended up on my cheese... =\ The restaurant felt pretty warm inside at first (makes sense with the pizza oven, all the people, and it being 110+ outside) but it seemed to get better. I was very happy with my pizza! The crust was thin but soft, which I love (unlike Pieology whose crust was like a cracker). The toppings were very good. I'd probably get some oregano next time too. Swapped a couple slices for my boyfriend's BBQ chicken bacon pizza and I really liked that also. So while the employees weren't the friendliest, the food was very good!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza in a modest environment. Very reasonably priced. Friendly and eager to please staff. Just need to solve bright sun light  in restaurant in mid to late afternoon. It's very uncomfortable and blinding for customers but pizza is decent."}
{"text":"On vacation in Scottsdale and ate here twice within 5 days. This place kicks ass, I wish we had one in my hometown!"}
{"text":"Ate here last week due to the reviews here on Yelp and I was not let down.  I think I might have found a new favorite!  Got there right at 11:30 and it was a good thing we did because the line was out the door in no time.  Thankfully, the line seems to move along fairly quickly.  Loved the choices for toppings and was impressed on how quickly they served it out.    I think next time we might try splitting the pizza and a salad as the servings were so generous.  Both had plenty left over and had a nice snack for later.  My only disappointment is that I didn't try this sooner!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the $4.15 pizzas on 4/15!! I saw the owner helping the solid line of people out the door. Employees were smiling and they were cranking out great pizzas. I Expected a long wait for my to-go order but it was ready 15 min early! Great business, they will do very well."}
{"text":"I have given two days worth of thought to this review. First let me state that I love the concept of having them make your pizza in front of you, it's the Chipotle of the pizza world. A coworker who is gluten free like me recommended this place. So I went for lunch on Tuesday 1/20. I ordered the GF crust. The gal asked if I wanted her to put fresh gloves on so I said yes. I was glad that they took the GF thing seriously. After selecting my toppings, I paid for my pizza and asked the cashier if they could use a special cutter for my GF pizza. She replied that they have a special cutter just for GF pizzas. I was happy to hear that, however, when my pizza came out of the oven, a girl begin to cut my pizza with the regular cutter. She then realized what she did, and took the pizza to the back. I assumed it was to have a new pizza made. But no, she came right back with it. She grabbed what must have been the special GF cutter, and resumed cutting my pizza. I should have said something to her or asked to speak to the manager. I understand that mistakes are made, but to just cover it up was quite disappointing and sad, not to mention unprofessional. I do understand they have a disclaimer on their website about gluten free and cross contamination. But why bother offering GF if you're not going to take it seriously. So that along with the intestinal issues and bloating I've been suffering for 2 days is why I am giving this place 2 stars. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I just love this place.   The pizza is just excellent and the staff is great.   They have truly ruined me for other pizza places, because their value for the money is off the charts.   $8 for a pizza with anything you want on it is just awesome.   I always get a garlic and oil pizza, with pepperoni, spicy sausage and bacon.   I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here, and I'm there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I will say I absolutely love this place. I come here at least twice a week in which I always get a pizza and a pookie to go. Every time time has been a pleasant experience except for tonight.  I came in 15 mins before they close and one of the cooks decided to mumble \"fucking customers need to go away because were closing\". I literally walked in when I heard him say this. This is very unprofessional. I work in the service industry and even though I sometimes get frustrated, I have never spoke like that on the floor especially in front of customers.   Word of this wise, if customers didn't come in you would be out of a job bud."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this location. Everything was supper clean with a layed back family type of atmosphere. Their pizzas are very reasonably sized for the price. The toppings at the use are all really really good too they have a wide selection which is awesome. My only complaint is there really really stingy on the pizza sauce. Bith mine and my bf pizzas were extremely dry! Good thing they off ranch had to showed each bite. I would be back agen. Just make sure you ask for extra sause."}
{"text":"I visited this location on one of my lunch breaks and was delighted by the fantastic friendly service and quick delicious food! I've never been to Fired Pie before but I was definitely impressed and plan to return here for more lunch breaks. When I entered I was kindly greeted by a female staff member and she explained the menu to me. I was surprised to hear that any extra toppings are free of charge! This isn't common so I really value this part of the experience. I ordered the fired italian salad and added sundried tomatoes and croutons. The salad was fresh and filling. It was overall an amazing experience and I cannot wait to return and try something new."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome, but what made the experience at this location amazing was the level of customer service that we received. The ladies were attentive and answered all of our questions.  Great food and better people"}
{"text":"i ordered a pizza from here on uber eats, and got a pizza completely opposite of what i ordered. there was also several pieces of hair in my pizza. i have never been so disappointed with a restaurant as i am with this one. ridiculous."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!!!! Great service, always have a smile! Not stingy on the toppings and super affordable. First time stopping by but wont be last"}
{"text":"Pizzas have always been really good. My biggest complaint is the wheelchair accessibility. Very cramped,tight quarters trying to get around. Getting to the counter isn't bad but table spacing is very tight, making it a huge challenge for wheelchair users to get to tables then leaving. If the store is full then there is no way for us to get out without having people get up for us to pass."}
{"text":"This place was OK for lunch for a while.  Now when I eat here I get a gut ache.  No more for me."}
{"text":"Went in during a convention day tried to find something not too busy. They were slow when we got there but still seemed to screw up the order. Only one person was working but when it got busy you can tell they got frustrated and out came 4 more people from the back all confused as to what was going on. Then when asking for ranch attitude was given for no apparent reason. Will not be returning back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza!! Build your own has unlimited toppings. Delicious ingredients!! Last but not least they have a military discount."}
{"text":"My first time at this location, but not my first time to Fired Pie.  This is one of the increasingly-popular \"we-make-your-pizza-now-with-the-stuff-you-want-on-it\" places. (A lot of people I know call them \"Chipotle for pizza\"). As usual, the toppings were fresh and the pizza came out quickly and tasted great. The crust was crispy, the cheeses were melted, and my toppings were hot.  Their lemonade was very fresh - I saw the guy pour a whole new batch into the machine while I was waiting. I believe it is freshly-made; mine had a bit of lemon pulp in it to support that theory.  The main highlight here was the staff. All of the \"pizza builders\" were friendly and efficient - which was good considering the crowd in the place on Sunday afternoon. One employee even helped my wife carry our 4 pizzas to the table. They kept the tables cleaned off as the customers finished and vacated them, and the line pretty quickly, despite the crowd.  I don't live anywhere near this location, but we'll be back if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"I really like Fired Pie. This is not the first one I've been to, but it is probably the largest and most open. When we go, it never seems crowded. I hope this changes because it is my kids' favorite pizza place for design-your-own, thin crust pizza.   Think of it like Chipotle for pizza (and salad) ... but, who wants salad when you can have pizza?!?  My kids like the \"sauce and cheese,\" which is about as simple as it gets: pick a sauce, pick one cheese. Done. My wife has modified that by going with \"sauce and ALL the cheese... except gorgonzola\"   There are two tiers of pizza prices: sauce and cheese or BYO. So, you can pretty much put whatever you want on the pie if you want more than just one cheese.    I have become partial to the pesto chicken, but I substitute bacon for the chicken and put some roasted peppers on it. The bacon crisps up nicely in the pizza oven and gives it a bit of a smokey flavor.   Oh, get the lemonade."}
{"text":"Passing by from CA to NM. Friend recommended this place and it is sooooooo good. Ingredients are fresh and the staff is super nice. Thank you for the experience!! Tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, extra pepperoni, olive and mushrooms. So good. Along with a bottles IPA. Couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my co-workers and the pizza and atmosphere was outstanding. This was the 2nd time I have had fired pie and let me just say it was Amazing. I would highly recommend this place for lunch and or dinner!"}
{"text":"I think the hours of operation listed on Yelp are wrong, it's currently 827pm and although the door is open the staff says it's closed. Wasted drive."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and it was super delicious. We got one of the 11-inch pizzas and split it between my mom, myself, and my 4-year old nephew. It was enough for all of us. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try someplace new for pizza and found them via Yelp. The girl on the phone explained they're kind of like Subway and you build your own pizza, then they cook it for you. The pizza was good but nothing special. The price was also pretty low, so if you want a quick and decent pizza, it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Awesome-ness !!!!! Awesome-ness !!!!! Awesome-ness !!!!!  First time here and definitely WILL be going back ...  The service was great ! The choices for pizza toppings was phenomenal !    Overall ... Just a great place for some awesome tasting pizza ... And can't wait til the next time ..."}
{"text":"Been here many times. The pizza is consistently good - whether dine in or take out.  Service is sometimes good and sometimes so-so.  You will not be disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"We're kind of in love with this place. Having been on the West side for Supercross, we were looking for a gluten free place that could serve us a quick meal. Within 5 days, we were back at Fired Pie, this time in Mesa. This is sort of like a Subway concept - you pick you dough, sauce, toppings, then they toss it in the oven for a 5 minute bake. The regular crust is thin and their sauce/toppings are on point (LOVE the fact that I can get artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, roasted spinach, etc....). If you are looking for a gluten free experience - they are amazingly helpful. They change their gloves, used a fresh sauce, and ensured that our gf pizza never touched anything that wasn't clean. I cannot begin to tell you how grateful we are for the extra attention they gave our order. We will be back many, many times and we will tell everyone we know about you!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great concept! Must try! I tried their pizza with chicken, mushrooms, onions and peppers and it was delicious. Plain and simple. The crust is thin with just the right amount of toppings. Everyone I know that has tried it has loved it."}
{"text":"3+ stars, fast service, decent pizza but prefer a hand tossed dough. Not my cup of tea pizza wise but for those that like a crispy pizza, it's right up your alley with customization up to 7 ingredients. Decently priced meal with drink less than $11.00."}
{"text":"We love the new restraurants popping on makie your own pies. This place was worst.  Kid didnt pay attention to putting item on pizza. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"The pizzas are fantastic! Lots of toppings and you have so many ways to get creative with your pizza-different cheeses, sauces, salads, etc. The crust is thin and crispy. Everyone in our family (even the picky eaters) loves Fired Pie."}
{"text":"One if my all time favorite places to eat. I always feel welcomed, never rushed. The food is fresh. The preparation is visible, right in front of you.  I think that I've said enough but Yelp insists that I keep typing. So I'll add a few more words."}
{"text":"Fired pie is a \"subway\" style make your own pizza restaurant. We stopped in on a Sunday evening and beat the rush! Ordered a make your own pizza, small salad and a dessert pookie. Overall the quality was good, service was great. I would like to see more options for the salad toppings, but other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food but such slow service due to all the employees being in high school.. probably should have someone a little more experienced running the show at dinner time when it's super busy. Also asked for Parmesan cheese to take home and the amount was quite hysterical ( enough to cover maybe 1 slice) and we had ordered 5 pizzas."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and pretty awesome place.  The staff is friendly enough, and the manager is always checking up on his guests.  Very nice place, I'd recommend it.  I think my face is starting to be recognizable there."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!!!! Came back twice in one week. Delicious and a great concept. Build your own style pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is fast and you can pick what you want right down to the sauce and cheese.  Fast service and very friendly.  Thin crispy crust just the way I like."}
{"text":"After my last not so happy review, Fred sent me a message with an apology and promise to remedy the problem. He also offered to send a gift card that never arrived but whatever.   So at the insistence of the rest of my family we've been back a couple times to this location. Even though the same fella who ruined two consecutive pizzas for me in the past was still baking, he did a good job these recent times. I was very pleased to see the improvement.  We also stopped in at the new location downtown at the Collier center and they're still working out the kinks with some less experienced staff. I ended up with a soggy mediocre pie and made a quick mention to the manager. She offered to remake, but we were already running late for the Suns game. Hopefully she can get things squared away soon. It is a good value for a good pizza when they get it right. Sucks when they don't. Consistency is key!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!! Wonderful customer service and super yummy pizza!! Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a pizza girl, but my boyfriend is an avid \"make your own pizza\" guy. He loves this place. The toppings are fresh, just like the service."}
{"text":"My belly is full and my wallet is happy, but there are a few tweaks I would make to convert fired pie to a 5 star fast casual spot.  Things I loved: easy to read menu, variety of toppings, ease of ordering & check out, and the pizza of course! Perfect size too!  Things I didn't love: no vegan cheese, tad unevenly cooked pizza (one side was pretty burnt & crunchy), also unkept dining room.   One factor that makes me prefer their competitor, my pie, is that they not only have vegan cheese, but have a vegan pizza on their menu!  Also they have wheat crust which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Great variety. Quick and efficient service. Easy to split a pizza and salad."}
{"text":"Bomb thin Pizza!  All the regular toppings & few i've never had on pizza, like cilantro.  I tried a white pizza and a red and they were both great."}
{"text":"Great food and service for such value price.  This is like pizza development for all of us as there are so many combinations you can pick from you could never order the same pizza twice.  For the record, I wouldn't really compare them to *ubway as the ingredients were fresher and the pizza is much tastier."}
{"text":"This is a little bit different of an option when you feel like pizza.  It is casual and inexpensive, and you can choose your ingredients.  My husband and I have been a couple of times and built a delicious pizza on both occasions."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Fired Pie, I had such a horrible experience. The employees were rude and gave me attitude.  The employees were talking the whole time to each other; they were not paying attention to what I was saying. My pizza ended up with wrong toppings, and after I had told the employee, she got upset.  I decided to try Fired Pie again with some friends, and the experience was still horrible. The employees do not know how to treat customers. I will not be returning to Fired Pie."}
{"text":"This place is not very good and I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews. The pizza is not good. The crust is hard,they skimp on the sauce, and they don't bake the basil with your pizza... they add cold basil as a topping. How silly is that? The other ingredients are nothing to write home about. Not especially fresh or tasty. There Are countless better pizza places. The staff seemed like they did not want to be there at all. Our four pizzas came out of the oven warm but none of the toppings had baked well so the vegetables were not crunchy and the chicken tasted like it came out of the microwave. Definitely on our Never Again list."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  What an amazing value with an amazing selection of build your own toppings at $7.99!!  Even with a line, our pies were fired up and ready to eat in less than 5 minutes!   Great service, friendly staff that answers any questions during pie assembly :).  This location provides a yelp checkin discount currently on your first visit.    My first experience was the location by the civic center (same experience there too).  Definitely recommend if you haven't been.   Competitor's have smaller pies, smaller selection, higher prices and slower service... so Win Win here!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Tried Fired Pie after numerous recommendations.   Its really hard to walk past Barros, to try this place, but glad i did.   about 8 bucks and add your own ingredients.. great deal,, Super busy at lunch,"}
{"text":"Very tasty if you like thin crust pizza. It's kind of like a Subway for pizza. You walk down the class counter and tell them what you want on your pizza and they bake it in a open oven for about 10 minutes and your on your way or you can eat it there. Don't forget to try their lemonade. It's really good."}
{"text":"FIRED PIE IS THE SH**!!! This place really changed my perception of pizza. I came here and was blown away by the \"subway\"-like concept of ordering. I love how light yet filling the pizza is and come here frequently when I feel like pizza but don't want to sink into a deep depression after finishing a whole dominoes pizza. The actual place itself was a little messy but I guess that's to be expected when you're a busy shop!"}
{"text":"Quick Service! Great pizzas and delicious salads. Custom pizzas and salads to fit your taste."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of pizza's pretty much! You go in and you get to choose whatever sauces, cheeses, and toppings you want, all for the same price and they bake it within 5 minutes. Overall, great food, chill atmosphere, nice people."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good salads, great place to go. I've came here numerous times and the staff is always friendly and food is absolutely great. The gluten free crust they have is really good as well."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place: you build your own pizza or salad. They have a few of their own creations you can order (steak and blue and bbq Hawaiian are both worth an order) but you can customize anything.   The personal pizzas are thin crust so I am a huge fan of stopping here for lunch as opposed to the admirably cheap (Barros). I also think the ingredients here are probably much better quality. The prices are higher but still, for under 9 dollars I think a custom pie is reasonable. And they are big for one person, you won't leave full and you could definitely mix and match or share with others.   You order your food at the front, pay, and then they bring it out to you. The usual soda suspects are there, but they also have select wine and beer.   Every time I have been here for lunch, it has a good flow of customers but is never busy or over the top crowded. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious gluten-free crust, fresh and savory toppings.  Minus one star for the noisy/echoey dining area, chairs askew (despite being nearly empty at an off-peak time of day.)  Do not let that stop you from trying this fantastic pizza YUM-O!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Great service each time - they're patient when you pick ingredients and they are quick to get you your pizza. Good flavor too"}
{"text":"We came for Pi day. Surprisingly it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a super friendly girl who seemed to be the only productive one of the bunch.  She literally was doing everything. There were 5-6 employees behind the counter.  It was very unorganized. They were only putting two pizzas in the oven at a time. There was one girl who was simply cutting the pizzas.  She had a number of pizzas to cut but she was wandering around and being extremely slow.  There were three of us who ordered right after each other, all in the same group.  It took us 20 minutes to get our last pizza. She was cutting pizzas one at a time and delivering them.  We saw all three of our pizzas come out at the same time but she cut other peoples pizzas who ordered after us and skipped ours.  They were out of all the teas but one.  We asked if they could refill it twice.  We got two different answers.  The final answer was it takes 8 minutes to brew, but no action to refill.  I would have understood if the place was packed but we got there before the rush even came.  We took our pizzas to go, one of which was not completely cooked through. Half of it was raw. Would have returned it but did not want to wait/deal with the terrible customer service.  Will continue to go to Blaze.  Much better service and supply change management."}
{"text":"I have been to a few fired pie restaurants in Phoenix and surrounding areas. This is by far the best. I love the pizza and the different options they give you. I always get the pesto. And the workers are really nice too. One guy just came over and started talking about his trip to Italy. Random but atleast they acknowledge you as a customer and check and see how you and your food is."}
{"text":"My salad was okay. When I asked an employee for some nutritional info about the pizza crust I was told they had nothing on the website and nothing I could take with me. I have some food allergies so it's fairly important I know what I'm eating. I thought that was a pretty dumb decision for such a big company to make. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"DIY pizza for $7.95. Amazing!! I came with my mom and we split one pie, which was the perfect amount of food for the both of us. There are so many topics to choose from, it doesn't take long to create your pizza and have it cooked, and the end result is delicious. 10/10 - would come back anytime!"}
{"text":"Almost wish they would just charge per topping. It seems the employees have been given a beat down on using too many toppings. Now I just get dirty looks and a lot of eye rolling. Maybe next visit I'll just let them pick what goes in my salad."}
{"text":"This was my third time here. However, the last 2 times I ordered a glass of their tap white wine and in both cases the tap was empty and no one knew how to change. The first time that happened I opted for red wine and all was well, but should have not had to compromise. Then tonight, again out of white wine, the college age crew could not figure out how to change out the \"wine keg\" and as they were still trying to figure it out my pizza is ready. I asked that the price of the wine refunded to which the crew obliged. Apparently the process to do this is not known by the staff who was furiously texting someone to find out how to process a partial refund. After 5 or more minutes as my pizza is cooling the lead person comes over to tell me the wine refund is processed but provides no evidence. I told her this is the second time in a row this has happened and asked how staff cannot realize once the tap is not pouring the \"keg\" needs to be replaced. I advised that I will not be back. She apologizes and that's it. As I got home I checked my account and can only see the full charge but no credit for the glass of wine I never got. Then I opened the pizza box only to see the black charred edges of the pizza. I won't be back to this poorly trained and customer service inept restaurant. Suggest you do the same unless you like inconsistent quality and a complete lack of customer satisfaction orientation. Read the other reviews, mostly not good either!!!!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is located in the Deer Valley shopping center next to AMC Theatre - I did go during lunch and the place was packed. So much so not move wiggle room.  The beverage station is small - so need to wait your turn.  Food; This trip I tried to Gluten Free Crust pizza with Marinara and cheese - the crust was good and the toppings were fresh.   Cashiers- were crazy busy but friendly."}
{"text":"Literally has the most attractive staff I've ever seen as a whole! Also my pizza was good and the attentive staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! Thin crust is excellent! Will definitely come back for more. The salads are very generous and they have great tasting dressings. Love this place for a quick meal that is healthy."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh ingredients. The pizza maker was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the Hawaiian. It was DELICIOUS! Crispy, thin crust and plenty of toppings."}
{"text":"This is normally a place I tell my friends and family about, I went there with my family for dinner and one of the employees was VERY rude. She was the employee that starts the order. Rude and disrespectful on the other hand there was a blonde girl that was very pleasant to deal with. I don't take disrespect lightly and I intend to let my friends and family know that this location of fired pie isn't worth going to.  I hope the other locations maintain there service as I do like the food."}
{"text":"Don't use Fired Pie for delivery. They suck! Two orders,  four pizzas, nothing ever right. They suck."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's a DIY pizza joint with a flat rate regardless of the amount of toppings you use.  My only wish is they had a thick crust option as I occasionally like a thicker crust vs super thin.   Their salads are great here as well!"}
{"text":"Great new concept and delicious pizza! I would be happy to award this place with 5 stars, but the staff had a bit of an attitude which made the experience a tad unpleasant. Other than that, great food and an awesome, inventive concept!"}
{"text":"The crew tonight needs a refresher on when to wash your hands. It makes me nuts seeing people put gloves on dirty hands (picking things up off the ground) in food service. Also boxing up food after they are touching the register. I was asked by three different employees five times what I ordered. Really green crew maybe... It will be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out for the first time yesterday. Never been to one but the ladies working behind the corner were very helpful. We ordered three pizzas and a salad. Pizza was tasty and really enjoyed the salad. I love how you can get however many toppings and the price stays the same. Also the salad was a pretty large size I couldn't finish it all.  Service was great. It was clean inside. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"First off, the pizza was really good and very fresh. Having made in front of you and then having amazing crust, made the pizza perfect. Second, the dining area needed to be cleaned. It wasn't that busy at 2:30PM to be that dirty. Trash cans overflowing, trays stacked up and tables not wiped down took away from it being perfect. Lastly, I will definitely come back. The pizza is just to good not to eat here."}
{"text":"Really good fast casual food joint - a Chipotle for pizza. Came here for a quick dinner around 7pm and it was not busy. I ordered a custom pie for ~$8 with the following: garlic and olive oil sauce, fresh mozzarella, mozzarella, capicola, spicy italian, garlic, mushrooms and peppers. You can pile on as many toppings as you would like for the same price however I am not sure if I would recommend that as it has the potential to get soggy.  It was ready within a few minutes and they call your name to get it from the counter. The thin crust was perfect that I ended up gobbling up the whole thing (I ate like a champ during this meal as I certainly would have been fine with half of it!). Fired Pie has your usual pizza seasonings for the taking near the fountain drinks/soda/ice tea. There are also some alcoholic drinks for purchase. Credit cards are accepted and so is taking out. They do a good job here - efficient, friendly, affordable and clean."}
{"text":"OMGosh!  This place rocks!  Healthy pizza?  It's like Subway but for pizza.  Pick what you want and watch them pile it on.  One price!  So worth it.  Come taste a mouthful of YUM!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very accommodating, great family place.  Barbecue pizza is the best I have ever had.  The sweet balsamic salad dressing was to die for.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better for fast, custom and tasty individual pizzas. Great selection to choose from."}
{"text":"This is the first time we ate here. We are at a hotel and first called them to order delivery and was told they didn't deliver themselves but used a place like Grubhub. I went into yelp and ordered and specified no onions on veggie pizza. Got it anyway. It was relieved about 20 minutes after the time given so not sure if I have to rate Grub Hub for that and the pizzas and cheese crisps came cold :( NOT happy and won't eat here again. Oh, and when it was delivered the Grub Hub guy said Fire Pie doesn't have plates?! :( Sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been on numerous occasions. Continues to be great food & service. The staff could be friendlier & more engaging. But the food is good & selections are good & it is a fun place to go!  Great concept. We will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Great new spot for made to order pizzas that come out in just 2 min fully cooked. Fresh ingredients and welcoming staff that is always helpful. Great idea, try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good, quick customizable pizza, when you are looking for a lighter side of pizza.  That thin crust definitely cuts the calories, and you can tel their ingredients are fresh.  I come here once every couple of weeks and a pizza lasts me two lunches.  :).  Would definitely recommend for a quick bite for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Maybe you have to know a little something-something about how to build a pie so you don't mess up and get a pie that can't be eaten. But, as long as you get some kind of sauce and some kind of cheese, you're off to a good start.  Fresh mozzarella! Yes, fresh! How many chain \"pizza\" places are out there offering up \"pizza cheese?\"  Put all the ingredients you want on your pie. It's yours. No limit. No judgement. One price! Reasonable price, too.  Quick service. Built to order. Cooked on the spot. Excellent thin crust baked to perfection. Meat proteins precooked just right. Fresh veggies.   Happy, happy, happy. Oh, and they have Pepsi product, too. Yee-haw Mt. Dew!"}
{"text":"Prefer Mod Pizza..Better quality, faster service, and just more friendly!! Food was just ok and sauce was a little bland"}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my last review of Fired Pie, so I thought I would do an update.  The awesome part is, that nothing has changed, and some things have even improved!  Fired Pie is by far the best of these type of pizza places.  It is close to my work and I have probably been in there 20+ times in the last year.  Every single time, every employee is courteous, friendly and they will hook up your pizza any way you want.  If you want a grip of one particular topping, just tell them and they will hook you up.  Always delivered with a smile and always very fast.  If there is no line, you are in and out of there in under 10 minutes.   Now, onto the food..... Pizza.....I can eat it every day!  I wish I DID eat it every day.  I would be happy as hell.  Anyways, the best part about Fired Pie (at least compared to other pizza places similar) is the consistency!  Their dough is perfect!  No matter how much you pile on your pizza, their crust holds up.  You can pick up a slice and not worry about shit falling all over the place.  I can't say the same with other pizza spots! All their toppings are super fresh and their crust gets a nice char on the bottom and the edges.  It's absolutely delicious!   My usual order consists of red sauce, mozzarella cheese, tons of meatballs, some pepperoni, some spinach, some red onions, a grip of garlic and I get that all cooked \"well done\".    I really cant say enough about this place.  It is hands down my favorite lunch spot around work and I will continue to come back.  Now, if they can build one of these out in Surprise....take my money, take my money!"}
{"text":"A Chipotle version for pizzas. I ordered 10 pies for my family and every single one of us loved them.  It's really hard to say and remember what we ordered because it's so custom, but I loved my Buffallo chicken pizza. The pizzas came out quickly for a large order. The staff was courteous and patient with me, while placing a large order.   I wish they had one of these back home."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! I just moved from California and one of my favorite places to go was a place very similar to this! I was so sad when I moved as I didn't think I'd find a place similar but here's Fired Pie! I love being able to build my own pizza and have it made fresh in front of me. There's build your own pizza (which are huge), specialty house pizzas, salads, desserts, fountain sodas, milk/chocolate milk, juices,and even Beer and Wine, which is great for parents when they bring the family here for dinner. Everyone was really nice, the place was clean, and I appreciate that they employ younger kids. The owner was there and he actually delivered my pizza to me since it was kinda slow when I went (the line grew as I ate). It's also right next to Starbucks, which is nice if you want to top off your meal with a coffee or something refreshing. I'll make sure to tell my classmates about this place, pretty sure they'll love it, thank you!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here this week-delicious! I love the topping selection, how QUICK they cook your pizzas (I have a short lunch break), and how everything is a set price regardless of how many toppings you pile on. Yum!"}
{"text":"So I usually come here with my boyfriend a lot and this time the girl who helped me was rude and looked like she hates her job. Not really sure how she works with customers with that attitude. She's the white chubby girl who is sweating like a pig. The guys at the register were nice, however, after this I'll probably wait till she gets fired or quits before coming back to this location. Still love fired pie though! They just need to hire more friendly people!  **Despite her attitude, I'm still gonna go home n enjoy this pizza**"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Only $7.95 for a pizza that I can choose all the toppings!  It was excellent.  The line was long when I got there, but they are very organized, so it moved pretty quickly.  I cannot wait to go back!  I had a pizza with mushrooms, spinach, fresh garlic, and red onion.  It was excellent.  Their salads looked really good as well.  They have gluten free as well.  I was impressed!"}
{"text":"First time here. Pizza is super yummy.  Kind of reminds me of Chipotle in that you make your own pizza at the window and they cook it. Crust is light thin crust...yummy!!! Lots a ways to make a pizza...I had Italian meaty...very meaty!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Los Angeles and decided to try this pizza joint  went in and the customer service was horrible,  ruined my pizza experience :( sad pizza day"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, great concept, one price with as many toppings as you want. Friendly, quick service. Loved it."}
{"text":"Super quick, great to dine in or take out. Always friendly customer service. The toppings are fresh, & the employees always are helpful when it comes to helping pair delicious toppings together. Super convenient and the crispy crust is amazing. Also the pookie dessert is yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow!  First time here and well worth the wait!!  The crust is light and crispy and the toppings are high quality. You won't be disappointed. You gotta try this place. Small seating area. Be prepared to wait. But... Saving grace is the wine and beer bar while you wait."}
{"text":"Wow! Great pizza! The crust reminds me of pizzas made back east. Love that I can choose all the toppings I want and personalize everything. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Five star for this restaurant love the place, 2 Star for the employees come on you guys take some time to put together a great pizza with some pride have some respect for the pizza.  Fired pie take sometime to find some people who can at least act like they care about their jobs, the pizza and the customers you have a great pizza restaurant concept show that you care about it."}
{"text":"For a picky eater like me, this place is a-ma-zing. I can order the pizza EXACTLY how I like it. Sure, sometimes the pizza makers can be a little skimpy with the toppings, but you just have to ask for more. And they have every topping you can think of. Sucks when there is a long line and people don't know what they want...but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great thin pizza. Only one size and price (except for plain cheese being a little less). Simple idea and pizza was tasty. Exactly right for one person."}
{"text":"Good affordable pizza with unlimited toppings. So you won't be overcharged if you want some veggies on there."}
{"text":"My son loves designing his own pie. $7.95 for an 11\" pie with as many toppings as you want is hard to beat. The ingredients always seem very fresh. The pies are cooked in a pizza oven not on a conveyor belt system like a lot of places. The salads ($7.95) are also awesome. Staff has always been friendly & the dining area fairly clean."}
{"text":"I came in when it wasn't busy and ordered a cheese pizza. There was no one else in the restaurant, and the pizza came to me completely burnt on the bottom. The two employees were standing around gossiping, not paying attention to my order. Unfortunately I took it to go, and by the time I got home and went to eat it I didn't have time to return to the restaurant. The pizza was completely inedible. Two employees should be able to watch after one pizza in the oven. They had to have known it was burnt, but still served it to me. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"A nice handmade pizza made right in front of you. You can choose your toppings, sauce and also order a side small salad. Nice place. Always busy so you got to stay in a line but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Lunch is awesome and very fast. You get your pizza usually within 5-10 minutes. The range of choice for the toppings is pretty good. The only problem is the noise levels during lunch time. If you are looking for a quiet place this one is not for you. A lot of people come for lunch and it gets noisy but I like it."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizzas!! Love the make your own pizza idea and how fast it is to order and get the pizza brought to your table. I got the Hawaiian BBQ with chicken. So yummy. The best thing is they don't skimp out on the toppings no matter how many you ask for."}
{"text":"I dig that you can build your own pizza and make it how you want it. The people behind the counter are nice and it's a cool place to have some lunch, they do have the option for pineapple to be put on your pizza so I don't know if they can be trusted."}
{"text":"We went for a family gathering and the manager Adam was so nice and accommodating. He put tables together and the whole crew was fantastic! And the food was absolutely delicious! We will definitely be back and would highly recommend it! Way to go Adam, you rock!!"}
{"text":"After about 6 visits, I wanted to take the time to review this place. Every time I have been in, the experience has been stellar. The staff has always been friendly. This place has been packed with a line outside the door but I still feel they took the time to listen to my other and made it as best as if it were their first order of the day. In addition to great service, the pizza is amazing. The toppings for the pizza are so fresh. The pizza has always come out perfect. A nice thin crisp but not crunchy crust. You can taste the fire roasted flavor in every bite. And for the fifth star I'm giving them, the price. It's a very reasonable $7 for a pizza. I have brought several friends and family members for a meal and every experience has been awesome. I love having a great place to recommend to people. Keep up the great work and high quality Fired Pie!!!"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza and salad restaurant.  Thin thin crust pizza with choices of your own toppings.  If you are in need of veggies, building your own salad is a good option as well. Price vs quality is affordable. This is between fast food and sit down pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Another Fired Fail at Fired Pire. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and there were 10 people ahead of us in line. Service was slow, there were people breaking down the kitchen instead of helping process orders.  The teenagers working there have no clue about food handling.  I watched one girl run her hands through her hair, multiple times, while packaging the to go food.  The workers are more focused on flirting with each other than customer service. The line team assembling the pizzas did not change out their gloves in between orders. Meat gloves went in the veggies over and over.  A lady in front of us actually complained about her pizza because 1/4th of it was charred black.  The girl she talked to didn't care that she was dissatisfied and said \"Oh it's supposed to be that way\". The lady clarified she was unhappy and said \"It wasn't this burnt the last time we came here\" and instead of addressing the complaint, the girl said \"Sorry\" and bee lined for the kitchen so she wouldn't have to deal with the woman anymore.   It took 25 min to get our pizzas from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left.  They no longer offer parm cheese and peppers with to go orders so we had to hunt down the last remaining shakers they hadn't put away for the night. Our pizzas were soggy by the time we got home, 5 min later.    Why do people like this place?"}
{"text":"We went to this place shortly after they opened and it was great.. very clean and delicious pizza. The last few times we have been there all the tables and floors where dirty covered with pizza dropping, greasy finger marks all over the tables, trash and pizza droppings all over the entire floor and this was RIGHT AFTER THEY OPENED so we know they did not do any cleaning the night before!!!! The is unacceptable and GROSS... obviously the management there is not doing their job!!!!! Oh and I also saw one of the workers tossing the huge salad bowl with their BARE HANDS!! No gloves .. they just dug right in and was mixing that huge salad bowl with God knows whatever may have been on their bare hands!!! Needless to say we have stopped going there and it's a shame because the pizza is delicious... get a clue and hire proper management and employees that care!!!!!!! Pathetic."}
{"text":"I must confess... I just flat out love this place - borderline obsession could be an appropriate phrase here. No lie, once I ate their buffalo chicken caesar every single day for lunch for a good three week span. Aside from the salad from the gods, their pizza is amazing. If you come here at lunchtime during the week, prepare to stand in line for a good 20-30 minutes because it is ALWAYS packed, with very little exception. Why? Because they're food is amazing, the service is great, and it's a wonderful, casual lunch spot. Definitely an A+!"}
{"text":"Just visited this particular location for the first time and was finally pleased with a smooth ordering process at Fired Pie. I was greeted by a gentleman who was restocking chicken, to whom I said that I'd like to order a vegetarian pizza. He asked one of the other line cooks if he had clean gloves and would make it for me. This was a first, in my visits to two other locations. At least these guys were proactive and made an effort, where as other locations in the past just shrug shoulders and look confused. After cross contamination (the same gloves diving into meat & going straight into veggies or salad lettuce) was an issue several times at other locations in the past, rather than leave a bad review, I contacted FP directly. Fred responded to my message and said that if a guest makes that request, be it vegetarian or allergy related, the line cook is to handle the order all the way down the line, and even use a clean cutter on a pizza. At least they responded positively and seem to be trying to ensure the customers are satisfied with the cleanliness.    I think the pizzas and salads are great, the concept is great, AND the way ingredients are handled needs to be TIDYED UP imo. There is still a lot of natural \"spill over\" cross contamination, and I still watch cooks go from chicken or other meats directly to lettuce or veggies. If that's happening, does it really matter if and when I ask someone to charge their gloves?"}
{"text":"I enjoy the concept, value, taste profile. But today I was disappointed to see the manager without a hair restraint, eating in a food service prep area, and drinking packaged beverages. Clearly not an example of leadership."}
{"text":"One word - Awesome! Create your own pie, watch it get built and it's to your table within 15mins! Good value too, $8 with unlimited toppings! Salads are good too, great for kids as well!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, much like others have mentioned. It is very evident that the people who work here don't have the best customer service skills.   I have been to fired pie across the valley and there is no doubt that the pizza is always great and in my experience the customer service is usually on point as well, not this location. Our pizza had cross contamination of other toppings we didn't ask for- in particular my vegetarian mother found multiple sausages on her pizza despite not ordering this.   I walked past an employee who was walking around and I assume was supposed to be cleaning tables. She, however, was circling about 10 dirty tables with additional food all over the floor despite it being 430 in the afternoon and what I would consider a \"down time\" in their daily operations. How hard is it just to sweep and clean off a couple of tables in order to make your guests comfortable? The employees blatantly let themselves through the door in front of us and didn't even bother to hold the door behind them in order to let us in/out. In general there were multiple instances in our short dining experience that made it very clear that customer service is not a top priority within this establishment.   I'll be sure to go to another location the next time I'm in search of some quality \"make it your own\" pizza."}
{"text":"I can't even explain to you how much I love coming to this place on my lunch break. Fired pie is located near chipotle across the street from Scottsdale quarter. And is a super convenient stop if you are shopping in the area. You can order an 11\"inch pie and customize it and add whatever you want for one price only. They have a few pizzas on the menu that you can order in case you don't want to have to build your own. My favorite one is the steak and bleu cheese pizza with the garlic sauce. It's freakin' delightful.  The customer service here is amazing, always greeted with a smile and takes practically no time to get your food. You get to see everything from what they add to your pizza and when they add it to the oven (similar to a subway type ordering method) which leaves you knowing they didn't miss a thing during your order process.  they also have a pretty decent selection of teas to go with your meal if you'd like while also serving beer and wine.  They also have red peppers and ranch upon request at no additional charge. I haven't tried the salads here cause the pizza is too good to try something else."}
{"text":"Great product and service!! The product was great quality, and delicious. I love the concept, make whatever you want for $8. And they have beer and wine, another great add for pizza! They also make salads, again anything you want for $8. Fired Pie just won over our pizza nights."}
{"text":"Usually good service. Lately they have been using less and less toppings. If I ask for olives I should get a few in each bite, right?? Today I got a salad for 8.50 and half of the shell is empty? Seriously, I'll go to Chipotle across the food court and get a sale for less and with more toppings."}
{"text":"After seeing yelp reviews from other yelpers I've come to stalk (only their eating places!) I decided to try Fired Pie out.  Thin crust is my favorite as long as it isn't soggy.  This doesn't disappoint!  Crispy and easy to pick up a delicious piping hot slice.  I tried the Meaty Italian and according to my grunting husband it is a winner!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of wood fired pizza places that I have been to but this one sticks out to me. It's quick and you can customize it with anything you desire & its so delicious. The only thing is that the people working there aren't all that friendly. They always look pissed off. But the good food makes up for it I guess. If I saw a smile once in a while, it would be 5 stars easily:)"}
{"text":"We called ahead to see if they could accommodate our party of 7. They were very friendly and let us know we could come on in.  When we arrived they were empty.   This was my first visit to this chain. Apparently someone has taken the subway model and applied it to pizza.   You build the pizza from the bottom up by selecting dough, sauce, cheeses, and toppings.   I like the idea of it.   The end result was an ok small pizza. The crust is thin and crunchy, the sauce was good and I picked all my toppings so I can't complain.   This was not better than my local pizza joint. Just different."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. When I walked in I liked the lay out and how open it felt. Of course it's nice since everything is new. If you haven't been to or heard of this place you basically build your pizza like you would build a sandwich at Subway. You start off picking your crust. They only have one size to choose but there are 3 types of crust to choose from. They were out of the herb crust which sounded interesting so I went for the regular crust. I picked pesto sauce and a variety of toppings. I felt like The guy who was making my pizza was not really paying attention. It then came time for him to make my friends pizza and as she is telling him what she wants someone yells to him from the back and he leaves without saying anything to us. Ok-weird. Another girl comes over and says -is this all you want? Umm no I think I would like some toppings. Once we finally got that straightened out we paid and went to get our drinks. There was no ice but the guy who disappeared from the counter showed up with ice to fill the machine.  The pizza came out quickly but honestly the flavor just wasn't there for me. Maybe it was the combination or service not being great but honestly I would just go to Mod next time. They are much more organized and I think the pizza is better. Oh and when we went to leave the trash can was overflowing into the ground. Yuk!"}
{"text":"Just no.   I like the concept but the actual pizza is a flat bread. The taste is okay but I wanted dinner not an appetizer. I suppose this would be a perfect lunch spot.   The location is convenient, place is clean, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza, a variety of toppings to choose from, fast and decently priced. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fire brick oven  Fresh custom made  Pizza salad or baked cookie  with scoop of ice cream  Numerous toppings to choose from They even have garlic salt that can be used on your pizza"}
{"text":"Fired  Pie is the place to be for a personal size pizza create your own or go by one of their featured pizzas they have  numerous toppings to pick from and honestly have been adding more toppings such as steak and meatballs"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch for the first time. I can honestly say I am a fan! You can make your pizza any way you want. The best part about the pizza is the thin crispy crust. Definitely will be coming back here"}
{"text":"I loved Fired Pie. The pizza is great every time and I actually do not feel guilty for eating the whole thing in one sitting! This location is great! Right by my work. The one tip I can give people is to try to beat the lunch rush hour or go after. The line is crazy long during lunch but that is to be expected giving it's down town."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place if you like options. The price is a flat 7.99$ before tax for an 8inch pizza. You get a base and you can choose the sauces, meats, veggies, and seasoning. They dont limit you therefore you can add as much as youd like at no sacrifise.   Personally, i got tomato sauce on the inner ring and garlic sauce on the outer ring. On top is parmesan cheese, chicken, peperoni, ham, mushroom, and a sprinkle of oregano. It taste delicious!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is so good! This is the first time I've tried this place and it's amazing. The toppings are great and the crust stays nice and crunchy. It's the best build-a-pizza place I've been too."}
{"text":"Nice place to create your own pizza. Kind of like a chipotle way of making it. The pizza here is fantastic. Add anything you want to it and let the oven do the rest. I really like the walls their have these colorful pictures of the city. Pizza is definitely served well here."}
{"text":"I waited until the third time I ate here to write a review.  Their pizza is one of the best thin crust pizzas I've ever had. Crust is never too soft, nor is it too crispy, just right.  The staff is friendly and explains the different options they have to offer.  Great overall experience and AWESOME thin crust pizza. Would recommend to anyone.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"It's like Subway... but for pizzas. You pick the toppings you want, they make it and it cooks in about 3 minutes.  By the time you pay and get your drink it's ready.  It's thin crust, but should be enough for one person.  Not bad for a fast food pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We went for lunch today and did not have to wait for our pizzas! Great food, great prices. Oh, the staff is super friendly and the place is very clean. We look forward to going back many more times!"}
{"text":"Having been to another local company with the same concept, this place just didn't measure up. Judging this pizza place independent of the other, it was alright. The concept is great - unlimited toppings for one low price - but, though this place has a lot of toppings, they don't have all of my favorites and the toppings they do offer aren't of the highest quality. I wish they had ricotta or goat cheese. I wish they had more fresh vegetables... even their spinach was already cooked which lead to less than a great flavor.   Here is the pizza I ordered:   tomato and pesto sauces, mozz cheese (shredded and fresh), spicy sausage, bacon (not cut well, with large chunks that were hard to chew), spinach, onion, peppers, garlic, tomato, and basil.   I was impressed with their crispy crust and the pizza had decent flavor on day one.  The real disappointment was with the leftovers. There's no way I could eat this whole pizza in one sitting, so I had half a pizza left. The reheated leftovers tasted terrible... the cheese got that weird plasticky quality and it just tasted awful... only one day later. That would be my biggest deterrence to a return visit. While this place is alright, I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A fast, light pizza and salad spot.  I don't feel guilty eating this pizza because you control what goes on it.  I always love the Chicken Pesto or Margherita-and sub out sun dried tomatoes for regular tomatoes."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best pizza I've ever tasted! I love their thin crust pizza, and their fresh mozzarella is to die for! Super Yummy! Also you can add unlimited toppings so you can customize your pizza to your own preference! The best pizza chain in the valley! 2 thumbs way up :)"}
{"text":"My Indiana family says to give it 5 stars!  Everyone loved their pizza and had a bonus pookie thanks to a check in on Yelp. My niece said the \"P\" stands for perfect cookie. Fired Pie is one of our favorite restaurants. We bring all our out of town guest here and it is always a big hit!"}
{"text":"Fired Pie is amazing!  Great pizza where you get to choose all your own toppings at a reasonable price. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here at least weekly. Loved the fact that they have gluten free crust. Probably not work for those with celiac but ok for those with sensitivity. Highly recommend Fired Pie!! Yummmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I think I might be missing something here. I visited this place based on the awesome reviews and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed. Now, it may be partially my fault because I am not sure that creating my own pizza is one of my top talents but the pizza I made was a soupy and oddly bland disaster. It also took forever to get my pizza as it was mobbed. I thin I will leave the pizza creating up to the masters next time and purchase my pizza from some place who knows what's up."}
{"text":"Our new go to pizza place. We love that you can customize your pizza and salad. The way you like it. We share a thin crust pizza, two drinks, and a salad (they are huge) $20 out the door for a  great dinner.  Have sent several friends and family to this location. We now need one further out west in Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Was contacted by Fred and he was kind enough to offer his apologies from my experience. I will be back to enjoy some tasty pizza. Thank you Fred!"}
{"text":"\"Good\" pizza, not amazing as most reviews say, in my opinion.  Yeah it is not expensive but let's get real, it is walk up service.  Being a North Easterner I admit my pizza standard is pretty high, that said I'm not inclined to reinforce the 5 star ratings.  I would return though as it is clean and efficient."}
{"text":"This place is awesome now you can have a pizza with all the things for one low price! LOVE! & they have China Mist tea...uhh double bonus. Friendly staff, yummy pizza, happy girl."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty much the best concept for fast made-to-order I've seen. Amazing. I've been in 4 times now, and can honestly say this place is just wonderful. The last time I popped in for a to-go pizza on my way home from work. I love that I can customize and make it my own, and they are there with recommendations or just a smile while you keep adding on. I sat down and just a few minutes later my pizza was ready - the girl brought it to me and showed me the pizza to make sure it looked great to me before closing the box up. I thought that was a nice touch, this place is clean, fast, friendly, convenient but most importantly the food is great and for a great price! Give it a try - and if I you have a Dividend Miles Card you get double points here :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend showed me this place and we have been hooked ever since. The pizza is very light and fresh. I never feel like I do when eating greasy delivery. We usually split a pizza and a salad which both are completely customizable with fresh toppings. They have good prices and their tea they sell is the China Mist brand which is very good.   I just ordered through UberEats and everything worked out great so if there are people who want it delivered now you can. The only thing I wish you could do is order your food online so when you pick it up it would be ready. With UberEats I was able to do that since you can see all the choices to customize your food but you have to get it delivered."}
{"text":"OUT-STANDING!  This is 11\" of awesomeness, your own custom pizza pie, created with excellent ingredients, cooked in record time (3.5 minutes they say, which is about what it took), served with a smile.  At $7.75 per pie, no matter how many toppings you add, it's a screaming bargain considering the overall quality of the ingredients and finished product.  I had a fairly basic Hawaiian job for my first taste, and it RULED.  I'll get a bit more adventurous moving forward - there are so many ingredients available, which you can add or mix to your stomach's desire.  The pie was just the right size to handle my very large appetite.  The beverage selection was great - the usual array of sodas, plus 4 different types of fresh-brewed iced tea, and even what appeared to be fresh lemonade.  This was only Day 3, and the owners were chatting up all the customers, wanting to make sure everyone was happy, and clearly know exactly what they're doing and how to be successful.  This is a great concept, executed perfectly.  Fired Pie immediately shoots to the top of the office lunch rotation.  Trust me, fellow Yelpers, this is the real deal.  Head over to Fired Pie at warp speed and give it a try - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Yikes, not a good experience at all. Dinnertime Weds 2/15. Only 2 people in line ahead of us. Nothing moving, lots of people standing around, acting clueless & seemingly untrained. Pizza assembly moving at an absolutely glacial pace. Finally get to the front of the line, receive apologies for some sort of problem with the dough making apparatus. Pizzas finally make it to the oven, and are delivered quickly after that, but it's already been an eternity from all the time in line. Pizza is over-cheesed and as a result is totally limp. Garbage can is overflowing and various used silverware & pans scattered about. A filthy dining area when there are more employees than customers present is inexcusable. Overall a pretty lousy experience, especially having been to the Ray Road location many times, which is run quite efficiently and produces a perfect pie every time. Fred, you need to come in here and get these guys on track."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, customizable options,quick service. How come we had not found this earlier!!  Loved the thin crust. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best fast casual pizza for the price I've ever had. Period. Went during the lunch rush. I think I waited 4 minutes for my pizza. The crust is fantastic and no matter how many toppings you pick it's still 7.95. What a concept huh?!  Keep this place around."}
{"text":"It comes down to this: superb thin crust, wood-fired pizza and excellent salads -- damn tasty!  A Yelp find (thanks local Yelpers), we arrived around 4:30PM on a Saturday. Five people in front of us, but we were sitting down to a fresh and tasty salad in about 5 minutes. Italian Fired salads have mozzarella cheese and several meats (salami, pepperoni), and splitting 1 salad provides more than enough for 2 diners.  The pizza?  Crust was just right: not too thin, not too thick, and just the right crispness. Sauce was very good, and ingredients (pepperoni and sausage, in this case) were plentiful and savory.  Throw in friendly and efficient service and I'm a big fan!  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"My 2d visit to a Fired Pie (first at this locale) and I remain a fan.  I've only had the pizza and both times leave me wishing we had a franchise on the Central Coast. I like the fact the pizza is made to order before your eyes, and the topping offerings are plentiful and fresh. My wife is a fan of their salads, and as with the pizza, you design your salad composition to spec, then it is tossed before you and plated.  Service was friendly and fast, and facility was clean. Only negative was lawn mowing underway just feet away from outdoor seating -- might be worth negotiating a lawn mowing session that does not coincide with the 1130 lunch hour??  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"I was hungry for specifically mergherita  pizza. I ordered it, and while the ingredients were being topped I asked about basil. Because, really, basil is a big factor in this pizza. And the young lady that was making my pizza said they put that on after it's baked. And that makes sense. So I paid, waited for my pizza. When it finally got made, they told me that they were all out of basil! What!!!  it was still pretty good, but it was missing a key ingredient and that really sucked.  At least, three workers came in contact with my pizza before it got put into their oven. And none of them questioned?  \"Oh, hey, this looks like mergherita pizza. Is the customer aware that we dont have basil?  Buy no! Inattention to detail is so evident here.  It's very inexpensive for what you get but this place lacks real quality customer service. I will still go back, but will think of this establishment like Taco Bell or McDonalds where you expect lower standard for food and service. Then I wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is amazing. Get whatever you want on it. It's like a chipotle but 10 times better. Don't be afraid ask for whatever you like. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Just went to this new location for the first time last week and we love it here!! All the employees are so nice and they do such a great job! We used to go to the one off the 101 and 27th Ave but so glad this one is much closer and it's so good!!!"}
{"text":"Huge line during lunch time. I went in and got a salad, as the woman was putting my salad together it seemed as though she had used the same gloves that she had just handled meat with. That should have been my warning...but I was hungry and on a time crunch. The next day I spend the morning with my head in the toilet bowl. Clearly food poisoning. Don't go here if you value your time and body."}
{"text":"Saw someone carrying out a takeout salad, from Fired Pie. Just had to check it out. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Caesar Salad. Absolutely fresh & delicious!  Added tomato slices & sautéed onions (with pepper) as additions. Yummy!  You can invent your own custom pie (pizza) or salad, or order from their 'made our way' selections.  Located in Park Central with other locations in Chandler, Scottsdale & Deer Valley."}
{"text":"Such a great concept for only $8! Their chicken pesto pizza was AMAZING and the wait was minimal.    The environment is very casual and modern and I can definitely see the appeal.  I will definitely be back, my kids would love the concept of \"build your own\" pizza.    Kudos!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this locale several times and each time has been great.  Went the other nite with grandson.  Grandson asked for additional pepperoni and server loaded it on! Have been when busy and when slow and service is consistent.  I will continue to patronize this location."}
{"text":"It was just ok...I mean the concept isn't new so I'm comparing to MOD & Blaze. The crust was, maybe, thinner if thats possible. The topping selection was comparable with the exception of a spicy red sauce. For that they just add chili flakes, no problem. Prep & Cook time was fast and efficient. I tend to add a bunch of toppings so I didn't think it was dry but my friend only did a pineapple & bacon and thought  it was."}
{"text":"This place is great. I really enjoyed my pizza and salad. If you are coming during lunch be prepared to wait a little. They employees move you in and out as fast as possible but most people there are ordering for multiple people (office buildings and such). The ONE down fall I have with this place is they put waaaaaaaay too much dressing on their salads. I've learned to ask for it on the side but on occasion they forget and toss it for me. Not a deal breaker but still a little frustrating at times.   The pizza is amazing and the prices are too."}
{"text":"Was fooled by the signage. The face of the shop says wicked fast. They have a sign near the register that says how long the oven is taking to cook that day. Was in the shopping center at lunchtime & decided to give it a try.   What I didn't know was that they don't have pizza by the slice. They build, then bake a personal pizza on pre-made dough that's just sitting out when you order it. The time it takes to cook it wasn't that much faster than anywhere else. Ordered the mini, cause really just wanted a slice not a whole pizza. The mini is too small & the regular is too big for one person. (see photo)   It tasted fine but not any better than any other place.   There is no reason to go there again."}
{"text":"I stopped by today for lunch & really would rate this place a 3.5 star restaurant if I could.  The person who referred to it as the \"Chipotle\" of pizza restaurants was on the money.  It looks/feels just like the burrito place and the ordering process is also similar.  You get to choose your sauce, cheese, meat & veggie toppings from a wide selection and then it is cooked for you in their wood fired oven.  It is ready within 5 minutes.  The price is excellent $7.75 for an 11\" pizza.  Only negative was the dessert chocolate chip cookie I ordered was still raw/doughy in the middle.  Also it would be awesome if they could offer green chile as a topping.  I would stop by again for sure."}
{"text":"If you like thick crust, stuffed pizza, go elsewhere, but I like thin crust myself. The fired pie has everything else served quick. Even beer and wine. I think it's great! The staff is friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Excellent concept and good pizza. Wine and beer here. Very thin crust baked quickly. Needs a senior drink choice. We'll be coming here a lot. Good job, Patience! We appreciate the way you explained everything and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is my favorite!  The ingredients are always very fresh and I love all of the options!  I love the option of fresh herbs added after your pizza is cooked but it's always hit or miss if they actually end up on there. Always double check your order for takeout, one time they boxed up the wrong pizza and I didn't realize it until I got home."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is a cute little make-your-own thin crust pizza place, where you go down the line and add toppings as you go (like at a Chipotle's).  The pizzas are 11\" or personal sized, and for $7.75 with unlimited toppings you can't beat the price. Also since they're thin crust, it only takes about 5 minutes for the pizzas to come out of the oven and to your table or in a to-go box.   The only trouble is that this place is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, and sits right next to a Paradise Bakery and a Qdoba's. So parking can be a little tough at certain times of the day."}
{"text":"Get customized pizzas made right in front of you with great toppings and sauces to choose from, without having to wait for a long time that too at such a good price. This place is like the subway of pizzas."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a month and the food and service always teeters somewhere between 3-4 stars. It's better to avoid this place during the lunch rush cause it gets crazy but a late lunch or dinner here is nice and relaxed. The pizza is good and topping are actually pretty decent quality considering the concept of unlimited topping. It's one of my preferred fast casual establishments. They could get bigger cups though."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good, made to order and inexpensive. Outdoor seating was perfect. The service was friendly and efficient and our orders were up quickly."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!!  When I went here for the first time the other day I didn't know what to expect. From visiting the website it looked like they had pizzas you could order and you could also customize your own. From experience, usually a place will charge you per topping, so I went in expecting to pay a hefty price. I don't eat cheese or meat so usually I just get a pizza with sauce and a bunch of veggies.   When I walked in I saw that it was a Subway style pizza place where the worker takes prestretched dough off of a rack and puts the sauce and cheese on and then passes it down for the meats, who then passes it on down to another person for the veggies. I ordered a pizza with marinara, no cheese, red onions, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, pepperoncini, and kalmatta olives. To my astonishment it was only about $10 WITH a drink! Awesome!   It was so good I visited this place the next day and got the same pizza only I added the olive oil/garlic combination, fresh basil and oregano. It was TO DIE FOR! I will be back here many more times!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! They were so nice and full of personality. Every time I go here I get the same thing: a pizza with no cheese, no meat, and loaded with veggies. A little weird but they were very courteous to my veganism and even washed the pizza cutter before slicing my pizza. So nice!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is fast and delicious! They offer a great spread of toppings and I love how your pizza is fresh baked! The price is super reasonable for the quality you receive. I ordered a pizza with olive oil and basically all the vegetables they had. It came out hot and fresh. My boyfriend had a pesto pizza and their pesto is AMAZING!!! Seriously, next time I go I am getting the pesto for sure. Don't forget to try the Nutella and strawberry dessert! So good! Oh and the milkshakes... The Oreo milkshake is to die for! It's thick but not too thick and I love how they use real ice cream. Pizza Me you got it! I'll see ya soon ;)"}
{"text":"Great concept (pick any and as many toppings as you want for salad or pizza), great food (had pizza), great price (7.75 for 11 in), great service and ready fast. I'm excited they are opening a location closer to where I live cause it was good enough it's worth driving for."}
{"text":"Chipotle but with Pizza.  And I think of my life in two phases: \"beforeChipotle\" and \"afterChipotle\" so that's high praise.  The pizza is crispy and oven baked and delicious.  I ordered a simple meat pizza, which was spectacular, but flavored include BBQ and buffalo with a few exotic-ish vegetables and meats (can't remember them all).  4 stars instead of 5 because the staff, while extremely nice and courteous, seemed to be operating on 2nd gear (aka a little slow).  It wasn't a big problem because there was no line and to cut them some slack, I had just missed the lunch rush, so hey!  People do get tired.  But I didn't see the same hyper-speed coordination you see at other similar assembly-line style food places.  All good, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well went there today for there special. 3.14 with order of a drink. I must have missed it on the news when they said 1 item. My bad. But the manager there was a complete jerk. Making me feel bad cause I mis understood the special. I believe his name was mark. He also was the only actual working \"adult\" there. And to be quite honest I will probably never go back to that location for how rude everyone was and the attitudes everyone had. The \"manager\" was arguing and acting like a complete ass the the checkout girl when she was trying to figure out why the special wasn't ringing in right. I get you have a special going on and its going to be busy but I dont go to a place to feel un wanted. Also tables were dirty trash was over flowing. For being a new place I cant believe how horrible it is being run. Your manager (or whatever he is) needs an attitude check. If I ever eat at fired pie again it will only be the one by amc 30. Always had a great experience there."}
{"text":"What a great little lunch spot!  Make your own pizza and salad places usually disappoint me due to their rushed nature and poor quality, but that was not the case here.  Staff members were so patient and friendly, recommending which items paired well with the ones my family and I have already chosen. We went with both salad and pizza. The ingredients were so fresh.  Everything came out in a timely manner and was absolutely delicious! We all did family style so that everyone got to try a bit of everything.   Seating can be a little limited, but what do you expect from such a great place located in a shopping center."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Especially if you're vegetarian/vegan!  I don't eat cheese or meat, so having the opportunity to load up on veggie toppings without any extra cost is so great and so worth it!! Their ingredients are always fresh and they offer fresh basil too (yum)! The pizza is always cooked to perfection too. They have a pretty decent craft beer selection also, which is always a plus!! :D   Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! So excited to discover this place. Near my work but far from home - wish there was one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We came here on a hot day and either they do not have AC, or it was not working well. Either way, we were dying the whole time there and their fountain machine was out of ice. The seating area is not that big, but their bathrooms are clean. Besides that, there wasn't much wrong with the place.   It is a great value and the customization is amazing. Basically, for $7.95 you can have any kind of pizza you want. You go down the line and tell them what you want on your pizza. They have pretty much all the standard toppings, and a few weird ones like craisins and tortilla chips. They load it up and throw it in the oven. By the time you get your drink and find a table, it is ready. The service was great and they even switched out gloves when handling one of our pizzas we ordered, which was a gluten-free crust."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Amazing pizza and I love how you get to design it however you want and the cost stays the same. It also is pretty fast for being made to order. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This has become one of my new favorites.  Nice to be able to get what you want and the price is phenomenal.  I usually end up eating half the pizza, then the other half for lunch the next day.  Good service and quick.  Keep doing what you are doing..."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is the Chipotle's of Pizza. Advertised as 'fast casual' patrons have a choice of cheeses, sauces, meats and Veggies in an assembly-line preparation of an 11\" pie which is the only size offered. They also have salads which can be selected in the same style. The whole meal is literally ready in minutes. The pizza was ok; the thin crust tasty, but doughy in parts. It may suffer at the Tanger Mall location but was very busy the Saturday night we were there."}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed this place thinking it was the Westgate location! Ah! I've actually been to this Central location and the staff is organized and efficient, especially during the week considering their huge lunch crowd.  The pizza was good and made to my specifications. This is one of the better locations to try if you are curious about Fired Pie, as well as the Deer Valley location."}
{"text":"Meh. Pizza is good, but a little unorganized if you ask me. For being a new place the staff isn't very enthusiastic. They all look bored and they aren't the most friendly.   You can create your own pizza/salad and choose the ingredients that you would like, or you can choose from their creation, such as the Hawaiian or tomato basil. The problem with choosing one of their creations is that when you are going through the line they still ask you which ingredients you want. This is one of their standard pizzas, so shouldn't they be aware of the ingredients that are on their own pizza?   It seems that since they are newer they just may need more time to get it together. I do like they serve beer and wine. Nice compliment to their pizza."}
{"text":"We came here because it's one of the only places open close to our hotel.  It was very good, the employees are very nice, the atmosphere is fun and the price was surprisingly right.  We have some pizza left for later.  I was able to customize the pizza and the salad so we both got exactly what we wanted.  If we come back to the area I would eat here again.  Added bonus...the pizza was delicious cold at midnight!"}
{"text":"Stephanie delivered!   Me: \"I'm on a short time frame and need a pizza to go.\" Stephanie: \"I gotcha\" After piling up the pizza with almost endless toppings, she said it would be just a few minutes.  In no time she brought the pizza boxed with lid open for my inspection. After my approval she closed it up, gave me napkins, thanked me for my business (trust me, that goes a long way in the satisfaction category) and sent me on my way.  I think I'm in love. Sorry, Stephanie, I meant the pizza. You're very nice and I like you, but it's pizza."}
{"text":"**Beware**  On Saturday my son went in with his group visiting for a conference. He said it was strange cause there was a line and the employees were just prepping and didn't acknowledge them. The couple ahead of them said they had been waiting for a while. Finally the guy who was prepping dough said to give him a few minutes while he cleaned up the counter. These guys were working but I would think you at least say hi or some kind of greeting. After my son got his pizza it was burnt. Really burnt. My son said something to the employee and the only response was,\" sorry\". My sons teacher stepped in and asked if they can remake it. The employee said yes but he would have to charge my son as it's policy. His teacher verified by asking... \"you charge to remake a pizza that you burnt\"? Yup! We went through some reviews and my son picked out the guy. Here is my problem. You messed with my son and now this mama bear is pissed! How dare you take advantage of a young man who is learning his way in life! Store policy or not, get your manager and get it done. Own YOUR mistakes! I sent my som with the exact money he would need. He didn't take extra to cover your mistake! You should have paid for it if you messed up! Nothing is more frustrating then teaching children to own their mistakes when a damn adult won't!"}
{"text":"UPDATE ON PREVIOUS 2 STAR:  Owner contacted me and apologized and agreed fully that was inappropriate and would fix it. Thanks!      So this would be a five star review because my kids and I  really liked the pizza. Except one of our group went to the burger joint next door and brought it in and ate with us. Half way through our meal the manager walks over and says \"oh I didn't realize you brought food in front another restaurant\". After this very awkward and uncomfortable interruption, we all felt rushed and basically left before we were done eating. He did say \"I'll let it slide this time\" and \"go ahead and finish your food\" but it was already too weird and comfortable. Once he realized we were put off by the whole thing he apologized and said t was a health code violation and that if we got sick we wouldn't know whose food made us sick. Sounds good except only one of us was eating a burger and the rest of us were eating three pizzas so I'm pretty sure we could figure that one out.  Even if it is illegal as he suggested I've been to a hundred restaurants that allow this and have never had anyone tell us otherwise. My advice to this manager is pick your battles because this one didn't work out for any of us especially you. We would have definitely been back if this was handled differently or just left alone."}
{"text":"So I would go to Fired Pie after church almost every Sunday with a guest or two. This is a favorite amongst our Church members as well.  The location on Northsight Blvd. in Scottsdale, AZ is my favorite for many reasons. 1. They are generous with their portions. There is a pizza place across the street and frankly, this Fired Pie location understands value. You do get your money's worth!! 2. They honor their Veterans!  Thank You to Fired Pie for giving a discount to our Veteran's. I gladly support the businesses that honor our Veterans. 3. They also work hard to keep this place clean, the employees always use gloves to prepare the food and they are conciencious of the food handling. Let's face it, No one wants food poisoning.   So, I did have a concern when a guest of mine requested an extra serving of garlic and the employee refused. Long story short, we offered to pay for a side of garlic but since they have no way to entering the extra topping as a purchase, she denied the request in front of a line of customers. My guest felt a bit humiliated and I felt bad since I recommended the place BUT...  I was able to speak to Stephanie, the manager and I was blown away! 1. She was extremely responsive. It didn't take a day or even weeks for her to contact me..try minutes!!!!!! Yes, she contacted me within minutes. 2. Stephanie listened to my concern. As a consumer, it matters when I have a concern and someone is completely resistant to feedback. Sometimes people can be sarcastic or patronizing or even make excuses for the situation which discredits the customer and is in my opinion, insulting.  Well, my interaction with Stephanie was incredibly positive. She engaged in the conversation and understood why this was important to me. She really appreciated the feedback. 3. Stephanie provided a solution by saying that she will work on this with her staff. No excuses were made!  In the end, Stephanie expressed that she would like for my guest to give her restaurant another try. I thanked her for her responsiveness.  *********As I was about to hang up, Stephanie offered a voucher for a complimentary pizza. I was so surprised! Like I said, I was about to hang up and she was kind enough to do this.   You can't beat this kind of customer service! I love when businesses understand that us consumers have options on where to spend our hard earned money. The place is clean, the food is great, and they value their customers!!!!!!!!!  Thank you Stephanie and Fired Pie for being so good to our Veterans and your customers!!!!  ****Full disclaimer: Stephanie had no idea I was going to write this review. I was not offered a voucher in exchange for my review."}
{"text":"This is like Chipotle, except it makes wonderful pizza. The crust is thin and delicious. The toppings are awesome.. Create your own one of a kind pizza. I enjoyed the Alfredo sauce on my pizza a lot!  One only downside to this is that the spinach should be freshly used. First time here and I am hooked:) Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Food isn't why this place get a two star.  The customer service is horrific.  Not a single smile. No greeting.  No thank you.  Not a single smile, not even from the manager.  Also when I'm trying to customize my pizzas, they are trying to convince me they can't put more toppings due to overflow. Man, I can't fault tues tag.  They're probably trained that way. I've had enough of these types of pizzas to know that they could put more than double that amount.  So I just dropped it.  Just a horrible experience beginning to end."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Went for lunch and had a small salad and split pizza with a friend.  The experience of \"making\" your pizza by seeing all the toppings in front of you is awesome, and it cooks pretty quickly in that wood-fired oven.  The staff were super friendly - the owner even cleared out plates and checked to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  Service was great. Price was reasonable.  Food was excellent.  It will be a place I go to again and again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times in the last week.   You can make your own custom salad and oh. my. goodness. The amount of toppings they have can rival a full restaurant.  They are located in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square but even during a lunch rush, they are fast! I never wait more than five minutes to be helped.  The staff is always friendly. They know their product and the food is fresh. I'm so glad they are not far from me. I look forward to more meals with them.  *edit* I forgot to mention - if you do the cashback option through Yelp, you get cash back through this location! Win/Win!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Customized gluten free pizza for $10?  Yes please!  The staff was very pleasant, the restaurant was clean, and my hubby and I enjoyed sitting outside while munching on our customized pizza.  I love this place."}
{"text":"My family frequently visit this location and have never had a bad experience. The establishment is always very clean and the staff are always nice and helpful. Michael always makes a point of checking on the customers while he makes his way around the restaurant. My opinion... this is the best pizza."}
{"text":"Yay for custom personal size pizzas!  The concept here is like Subway meets pizza.  You pick the sauce, the cheese(s), the meat(s), the veggie(s) and they bake it up for you in less than 10 min.  Due to getting people in and out quickly, the pizza is a thin crust, which makes sense.  However, I love me a thicker doughy crust so for that reason I can't give their pizza 5/5 stars.  Still, I love the concept here and it's fun to pick all the unlimited toppings I want.   They also offer the same concept but for a build your own salad.  And they have pizza cookies w/ icecream, called \"pookies\" for only $3!  On my pizza I got red sauce, no cheese, spicy sausage, a spicy sliced meat, mushrooms, spinach, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil.  Yum!  The garlic and the fresh basil added an amazing touch.  I'd definitely come here again, and maybe even with a big group because they've got a nice large dining area."}
{"text":"EXCITING REVIEW BELOW!!!...................................................  This review is about the wonderful staff. The delicious food. And an A-hole incident.  I have worked in and run many restaurants over a 30 + year stretch, so I know how things work.  I have been to this location 7-8 times and have always had the best, friendliest service. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure customers get what they want. They are always smiling and ask how we are doing.   The food is excellent. You can order a custom pizza, or order one of their pizzas and add what you want for the same price! They also have great salads that you can customize to your liking. They have the usual sodas and teas AND Great bottled beer!!  All ingredients are fresh. What more can you ask for from a nice, fast food-ish restaurant?  This next part is long, but very important............................................... Sat, the 24th, my GF and I arrived about 8:50 to see if we could still eat in the restaurant. The girl was very welcoming and apologized that they might be cleaning around us once they closed. Since we got there VERY close to closing, I was more than happy with her reply.   As we stood on line, a man at the front (who will be referred to as 'A-hole'  from now on. my word, NOT the staffs) spent at least 10 minutes asking every kind of question about the toppings. I felt that if you go into a place 10 min before they are closing, a person could be a bit considerate.  The girl rang up his food and as A-hole signed for it, he said the ingredients for the pizza were wrong. The girl apologized, but said it was what he ordered. She apologized again and said they would make him another. The first pizza got put to the side. A-hole ordered another pie using a VERY condescending attitude. \"Maybe if you listened.\" \" Seems like you could get an order right.\" \"You know taking orders means listening.\"   A-hole sat down and the rest of us ordered. I apologized (as we ordered)  in a loud voice for him being an A-hole. My GF and I sat down. The guy got called for his pizza, got it and started eating. After 10-15 minutes, A-hole gets up, goes to the counter and tells the girl the pizza is made incorrectly. She apologized,  but said it was what he had ordered. A-hole started making a stink and belittling her and the rest of the staff. He was telling the girl that apparently she could not hear. She replied that she did not take his order. A-hole argued the point for 5 (!) minutes, then realized he was wrong and said it was another girl (so apparently, he did not even recognize a person he had spent 5 + minutes talking to 15 minutes ago!). A-hole started telling the girl he was not satisfied with his 'customer experience', that he would not be back, that he demanded to get the pie for free (the girl explained that he had eaten half the pie before he said anything). And I believe that during the whole 'encounter' she had given him the first pie after he asked for it. A-hole kept ranting and b!tching, so the girl offered to call her manager, but A-hole refused. She insisted and called, but the manager did not answer. The girl gave the him the managers number and he stomped off, sat down and kept eating his pizza  (!).   Throughout the incident, the staff was obliging, apologetic and trying to make things right for A-hole.  I had had enough of A-hole, so I went to the counter and asked for some paper, telling the girl that I wanted to give her my number and get the managers name so she could contact me about Mr. A-hole. I went and sat back down. After 2-3 minutes, A-hole gets up and asks if I wanna give him my number also. I said I didn't have anything to say to him. That I would talk with the manager about the incident. A-hole came over and stood right in front of me, saying it was none of my business and blah-blah. I told him he was an ass and that he had better get away from me. He pouted some and left after telling the staff he would refute the bill with his credit card company. After we had finished eating, I went an apologized to the staff again. They were very gracious about the whole thing. GF and I left and on the way to our car, there was A-hole at Starbucks patio, eating his pizza!!  It takes a lot to serve people every day, People in the food industry are not lower than anyone else and they are not animals. Please take a moment to give some respect to the people around you that are doing their best to help you.  One last thing....  Mr hippie, prissy, d!ck, 'holier-than-thou', A-hole. If you see this, and I bet you will, Feel VERY free to contact me and we can do breakfast, lunch or dinner    :)   PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch yesterday and had a pizza made to go, the guys making the pizza probably shouldn't be working in the food industry. They didn't change their gloves before making pizza. Then I'm waiting for my pizza and they had the wrong name on the box and in the warmer oven, as if I ordered online. I ended up throwing it away. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to grab quick bite while shopping. I love the 'build your own' 11 inch pizzas. It only takes 10 min or less to bake. I've learned that keeping it simple always tastes better than trying to overload the pizza with too many toppings. Plenty of leftovers; if you're not too hungry, big enough to share."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7.75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price."}
{"text":"On 8/22/16 I visited Fired Pie. I have been eating at the Collier location for months and I've got to say, what a transformation! Lately, every time I go in I'm greeted by a new friendly face that is eager to take my order. Maybe a little slower going down the line, but I'd rather take a few extra minutes of my time than to feel I'm an inconvenience or get my order wrong. I'm a fan to see them toss my co-workers salad even though it was to go. The restaurant is cleaner, the quality of food is better and I now make more of an effort to go downstairs. Thanks Fired Pie!!"}
{"text":"We live next door so we were really looking forward to their opening.  My girlfriend and I went tonight and were slightly disappointed.  Keep in mind you get exactly what you pay for and they did just open.  Here were the two things that stuck out from my first visit:  1. TOPPINGS:  Very clearly pre-canned, pre-cut everything.  My girlfriend got the chicken pesto and the meat looked like it came out of a bag of the pre-cut chicken you'd get from Costco.  She added kalamata olives and they were salty to the point where she took them off (keep in mind she loves kalamata olives). I got a hawaiian pizza and the same could be said for the pineapple and other toppings.  It's hard to gripe when you're paying so little but there is something to be said about a pizzeria that actually does REAL food prep.  I highly recommend that they ditch the pre-fab meat/veggies even if it drives the price up a few bucks because as of now everything tastes very mediocre.   2. SODA MACHINE:  They have one of those touch screen machines that has multiple flavors that come out of one place.  I'm not a fan of these in general and when we were waiting for our food, we watched a boy proceed to try a flavor, dump it, and mash the screen with his hands to choose another flavor, about 5 times.  It did not help our appetite at all.  Thankfully we had beers.  The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean and overall I like what they have done, that being said Pizza Me! needs to do something to separate themselves from their competitors.  We will definitely be back, just hope to see things improve."}
{"text":"The Fired Pie is one of my all time favorite pizza joints. I love being able to customize my pizza to my liking.   I especially enjoy coming to this location for my Pies because I'm always greeted with a smile and the crew makes my pizza exactly the way I ask. They're cooked to perfection and delivered to the table!   It literally one of the fastest ways to get a home made custom pizza with whatever you want on it! The best part is the set price and none of the toppings are extra.   There's always enough to take home and leftovers are just as tasty! I recommend using a toaster oven over the microwave though.   Definitely a 5 star review from my wife and I after our 3rd visit without a hitch. We had an excellent date night and even tried a Vanilla Rootbeer from their \"anything you can think of\" drink machine."}
{"text":"Pizza made your way --- So if you don't like it, it's your fault!  I've been wondering about this dreamy pizza place for a while.  Everybody talks about it, I see various people checking-in, and I always wondered when it will be my turn to pop in.  As if by Fate, after buying some white chocolate beer at Whole Foods last week, I saw this gem of a place while driving away.  A-ha!  So that's where it is!    A quick marketing sales pitch to Linh and suddenly this was suggested to be our lunch spot this week.  So rounding up some pals, we set our lunch date for 11:30am today but moved it up by 15-mins.  It was a good call since a million people came in right at 11:30am.  This place got packed.  Fast.  Also, I think I ended up flashing panties to the whole store when this air current whipped my dress up.  Fired Pie = so good it'll make your skirt flip...literally.  Anyways, not wanting to scream over the glass divide, thank you genetics for making me short, I chose to get two \"re-use\" flavors:  Chicken Pesto and Hawaiian BBQ with pepperoni instead of Canadian Bacon.  After trading some slices with my lunch dates, we tucked into some tasty pies.  They were delicious!  The crust is the perfect crispness and the ingredients were fresh.  I love the Hawaiian BBQ!  The Chicken Pesto was also delicious and the slice of Steak & Blue I yoinked off Linh's tray was also incredibly flavorful.    Here's a question:  Why is pizza referred to as the poor man's steak?  Regardless of the answer, Fired Pie has won me over.  $10-something for a medium drink and a pie made my way is pretty darn decent.  I'll be back, Fired Pie!  Next time I'll wear jeans so I don't flash the other patrons."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a first time. My UberEATS delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best I've tried so far.   I ordered the Mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices. My only complaint is: the crust was a bit dry, a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt.   I'm very captious about my pizza, but I honestly state I would order another one again in the future."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here just before going to the Phoenix Symphony on Fri May 18, 2018 at 6:30.  Place was quite empty!  We each ate a half pizza to avoid taking the leftovers to the symphony, $4.72 for half a pizza including tax, which I think is more expensive than MOD, Pieology, and Humble Pie.  They were willing to make each half the way 4 of us wanted.    Pizza was really good, thin crust and crispy crust.  Ingredients taste good too.  Place was clean. I like Fired Pie and MOD the best, and Pieology the worst of the four because Pieology crust was like doughy shoe leather and not a \"crust\" at all.  Pieology ingredients didn't taste that great either.  I also did not like Pieology because the location I went to at Chandler Mall (101 and Chandler Blvd) did not have napkin dispensers at the tables, only at the drink station.  So if you are sitting on a long bench, people have to slide out to let ME out to  get more napkins.  I will be happy to eat at Fire Pie again."}
{"text":"Price is more expensive than MOD Pizza which is $7.57/ 11\" pie before tax, and I cannot say which is better.  Fired Pie is $8.29 before tax.  But I would go to Fired Pie again.    We were the only ones in the restaurant.  I like it that I am not charged when I pick MORE of the most expensive ingredients, and the crust is still crispy (I ask for well done, even if edges are black).    I ordered my pizza with spicy sausage, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, different cheeses, pepperocini, mushrooms, and other ingredients I forgot.  It was so delicious.    Restaurant was clean.    We only went to Fired Pie because my friend and I were looking to eat at Burrito Express next to it, which I had a half price voucher for.  But I didn't know BE closes at 3 pm.  The Vietnamese/Greek restaurant next door was REALLY EXPENSIVE for what you get.  So we went to Fired Pie next door.  I always wanted to try Fired Pie anyhow, cos it was on PBS Check Please.  My only complaint is Fired Pie is not cheap as MOD Pizza, and both pizzas are equally delicious, so that is the reason for the 4 stars for Fired Pie.  I gave MOD Pizza 5 stars."}
{"text":"I stopped by this local chain yesterday late afternoon located in a Scottsdale Fashion Square food court to sample their veggie pizza pie.  I was at the mall for other reasons, and because the weather cooled down tremendously after that scorching early record heat, I just had to celebrate- especially since I normally don't eat out much or eat food-court \"cuisine\".  I like to cook my meals at home because I know I cook better ;)  I ordered this pizza to go... The pie was made to order with a thin crust pre-made (the crust thickens when cooked), which the guy stretched out to 11\" in diameter, fresh and abundantly topped with: tomato sauce, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, red onions, mushrooms, black olives, & peppers.  He even asked if I wanted more portion or extras, so I was not skimmed.  Make sure to look out for that- watch them prep, and not distract yourself i.e. chatting with someone or looking at your phone so they don't get away with you, which is common with custom orders, and that's why they do it in front of you so that you have proof that they're doing exactly what they said they'd do that you're paying for.  The portions were evenly selected and laid out so you can taste everything without a flavor overload.  Yes, he wore gloves, and I appreciate their sneeze glass guard.  Next, the pizza was cooked in the fire inside a large oven slightly in back that we can view.  The entire prep and cooking took about 15 minutes, which I prefer because homemade food takes awhile to taste good just like at home, right?  They don't need to rush for me :)  The pie was moist & tasty, and the crust was crispy-soft & not-too-dry for easy chew/swallow.  Yes, I eat all the crust.  The pie wasn't salty or oily.  They also offer gluten-free crust for $2 more.  Overall, the pie portion was generous for food court standards.  I am Italian, so I can decipher a decent pizza to start with ;)  The staff was polite and congenial. It cost $8.49 + tax.  Tip was optional.  And, I earned a whopping bonus rebate of 64 cents from Yelp's 7% cashback bonus program, that Fired Pie participates in.  The credit goes to your card that you signed up with on your Yelp profile account.  So, that helps bring down the total ;)  Thanks, Fired Pie, for your ethical service and for the cashback!"}
{"text":"Love it for take out pizza or a quick lunch.  Sometimes the pizza is cold or undercooked.... but they are good at fixing if needed.  Super fast when the line isn't out the door.  Gluten free options too."}
{"text":"For 8 bucks unlimited toppings and I get the whole pizza to myself. Large selection of sauces and toppings, quickly cooked, no complaints at all"}
{"text":"I've always had a good pizza from Fired Pie. Fresh ingredients. Friendly service. Good dinner spot in Chandler:"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quick, easy to order, good selection, and surprisingly good!! I'm happy a friend recommended this place to us- it was busy at Scottsdale Quarter and I didn't want to wait for a table with my 5 year old... This was perfect and she loved the pizza, too! I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great concept, quick, fresh flavors, thin bread is amazing, and hip style.  Definitely going to be coming back here for my pizza's in the future.  Look forward to them expanding to more locations in 2015.  Couple reasons I don't feel like they deserve 5 stars yet are:   1. NO TV's!!! I have many childhood memories of going to the local pizza restaurant for pizza with the family, awards banquets for sporting teams and sports viewing events. It was prime time dinner and I was the only one in there other than one guy getting a pizza to go.  A lot of empty seats. Sporting events draw people in and get them to stay longer. Maybe this new company is trying to save money but having the largest TV on the block would put you ahead of your competitors.  2. The staff!!! While they were friendly and looked busy...no one asked if i had ever been there before or suggested I try something new.  Left me with a question in the back of my mind...Do they understand they're a new restaurant/concept that not that many people know about yet??  Let's get excited about it and engage your customers!  So glad this place is a short drive away, love the pizza, maybe just need to get my pizza to go next time!  K"}
{"text":"Just had some delivered via Uber Eats. Great food. In store, always clean, staff always very polite. Well run restaurant company, could also add a strong health conscious alternative."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this place. I went for lunch today and had a personalized pizza and pookie for dessert. The pizza was delicious and reasonably priced. There is a great selection of toppings. I got pepperoni, spicy sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and artichoke. The setup is similar to Subway or Chipotle where you can choose your sauce, cheese and toppings for the pizza. The cookie was the perfect size- small enough so you don't get too full. I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back for a $5 glass of wine or $3/$4 bottles of beer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Imagine chipoltle but with... PIZZA! I went here on a Friday around 6pm and there was barely a line. The price is very fair for a personal, quick pizza.   The only con in my opinion is that the employees did not ask me if I had been there before. So I was a little confused right off the bat. They kind of just stood there waiting for me to talk. I had to say \"Ok so this is my first time here, what do I start with??\"   Overall, awesome experience for some awesome food within minutes!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through amazon and definitely will again. The gluten free herb dough is great. They do not put much sauce on their pizza so I recommend asking for extra. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza that is served quickly at a reasonable price! 2 thumbs up! I brought my family here and now they love it too!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I've been going to this specific location for 3yrs and not once, not one time have I had a poor experience.  That's coming with my two littles (3yo and 18mos), running in solo to go, meeting friends for lunch or dinner, it has been consistent every.time.  Service, impeccable. Food, on point.  Here's the thing, we all k ow pizza isn't good for us all the time....this spot makes it worth it every time. Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. My kids love being able to watch them create their pizzas.  We drive here from Casa Grande just to have this for"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I thought with the fast, design your own pizza strategy, the product would suffer, but I was definitely wrong. You get to pick out your own toppings and sauce, and the pizza is cooked very quickly. Price is very reasonable, and the quality is very good.  This location is a bit hard to find, but I definitely suggest stopping by and giving Fired Pie a try. It's affordable, fast, and yummy. Next visit I want to try a salad in addition to a new pizza combination."}
{"text":"Fired Pie is the place to go for Build Your Own Pizza.  Every location I have been has a consistent taste and speed of service.  Even with a line out of the door each of the staff knows their role and the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"$8.29 personal pizza with super thin crust which I loved. I don't like filling up on crust.  I got almost all the meats, including anchovies. Some veggies.   Soda, large, for $2.49.  A little pricey, but the pizza made for two meals.   We got there early with no line. It takes a while to make custom pizzas, so if there's a line, be prepared to wait.  The ingredients are set up like a port o subs in front of you.   I don't like pizza usually, but I give the service, mostly young kids, and food taste, quality, and perfect cooking level 5 of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza while watching them do it in front of you.  - Very  in expensive - great quality - very generous with the toppings - pizza was ready in almost 5 minutes  Definitely recommend for anyone that likes pizza."}
{"text":"what a concept.  What quality.................and all for a VERY FAIR price.  It's the subway of pizza's.  you pick your crust, sauce (4-5 kinds) cheeses (5-6 kinds) or have them all.  Choice of about 12 meats (or all) and choices of about 20 vegtables (have them all)  no matter if you order a cheese pizza or a 5 cheese with 10 meats and 5 veges...........the price is still $7.75  Owner very engaged. they do the same with salads too.  HIGHLY RECCOMMEND,   a MUST"}
{"text":"For a fast-food, strip-mall pizza chain, I was impressed. Good cheap eats ... seemed like high quality ingredients and the pizzas were tasty. Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"The pizza there is so salty. My goodness. I could not finish my pie. I gave it two stars because the concept is cool."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza MY way! I love this concept and this location does a great job preparing the food. The restaurant is always a little dirty. We have had to send silverware back twice and then chose the plastic stuff. But, the salads are HUGE and if you don't like them, it's your own fault because you choose every ingredient. I get my dressing on the side and they are decent, but not homemade.  They have that \"preserative\" taste. My favorite pizza is pesto, fresh garlic, italian sausage, onion, light on the buffalo mozzarella or no cheese at all, and fresh basil. They serve China Mist crack tea..."}
{"text":"WOW! Please try it! It's fresh and delicious! You get to pick all of your ingredients. The options are endless. They can add more of this or that no problem. Salad portions are huge too. I would say this is Subway in Pizza form.  Can't wait to take my family."}
{"text":"My first time at Fired Pie:  As you may have read, this place has great reviews. But to be honest with the reader, the reviews do not do this joint justice.  At first glance, it seems to be a new wave type of restaurant. The pizza oven is the same try-hard type used at Sauce, and the designs on the walls are tacky and scream 'Scared Straight' with quotes like \"You Inspire, We Fire\" (I mean, I guess).  The wait wasn't too long, but I'm going to make an assumption and say it definitely gets busier with many corporate offices being located around the area. As I walked up, I was bombarded with options. All different types of sauces to start with, and feeling a little frisky, I went with the barbecue and fresco sauce to being the first layer of my barbecue chicken concoction. I next topped the sauces with the barbecue chicken, bacon (because like, honestly really like come on seriously bacon plz), and my vegetable choices were pineapples, olives, tomatoes, and spinach.  The nice young woman helping me, Kendall I believe it was (or something, but it's not like I'd remember anyway lol) was really really helpful and outgoing! She walked me through the whole process and taught me how to make the perfect pizza with both my stomach and my heart! I even went back for one of their pookies (cookie with ice cream on top) which was about as average as it can get.  In the end, the experience altogether was alright. The pizza and service were great, and the rest was eh."}
{"text":"My wife and I both love and hate Fired Pie. We have frequented the Deer Valley location since it opened a couple of years back, and the same for the new location at Westgate, unfortunately we are having more and more negative encounters with each visits. Almost without fail something goes wrong when we visit, the worst couple experiences are as follows...   Went in after work to get a couple of pizzas to take home, I was one of 2 customers in the store, I ordered 2 pizzas and the other customer after me ordered 1, when I got home with the pizzas expecting the pizzas I went through the toppings line preparing, I found that I only received 1 of those and then the other customer's pizza, so of the 3 pizzas they made at that time,  at total of 2 orders, those 2 orders were messed up. We called and explained and all they could do is offer an apology at that time, nobody on staff had any knowledge of how to work their iPads to process a refund. OK fine, lesson learned check pizza boxes before leaving!  The second and definitely the worst experience was Sunday afternoon at the Westgate location, there was a decent size lunch rush going on but nothing crazy, we ordered our pizzas and proceeded to wait for them to be finished, roughly 15 minutes later my wife's pizza came out and I stood for a while waiting for mine, another 10 minutes passes and I am finally told that my pizza was lost, they didn't know where it went and that I could get back in line to order another one. The line there doesn't move quickly as any customer knows and I didn't feel that was an adequate solution or any kind of customer service. One of the owner's was there and just kept sheepishly shuffling pizzas around in the ovens, he was aware of the issue but chose not to do anything about it. I requested a refund and after some time and several other staff members looking through the iPad transactions to find my was told I would be refunded for the lost pizza, no receipt was provided however.   I'm not one to compose a negative review for a smaller franchise, and definitely not one that I actually love the food from, but at this point visiting their locations is just so painful and never go smooth, one pizza is always done well before the other, makes dining with your wife difficult. The lines are painfully slow and unfortunately every issue points back toward poor management/ownership. Customer service starts from the top and you would expect that if nobody else cared about the customer the owner would. Anyone that frequents these restaurants can quickly see these same issues and easily point out inefficiencies in their processes and customer service. It always feels like everyone is new, regardless of how long they have been open. That said they pizza is really great and if you can manage to get in and out without issue it is worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place, but probably not as much as my friend who eats here every single day."}
{"text":"I went here a few nights ago for the first time, and I must say it will be the last time. The restaurant reminded me of Sauce, but the quality of the pizza and ingredients left much to be desired.   Pizza Me! offers unlimited toppings, which sounds good on the surface, but I found the ones I got to be lacking in taste. The pizza itself has an ultra thin crust that tasted more like cardboard than pizza. It had a bit of an aftertaste too, and I felt the need to have something else to get rid of it.  The dining area had issues too. The sun hits this place without anything to block it, so it is difficult to find a table where you are not somewhat bothered by it. The floor was dirty, and the tables didn't look that clean either.  If this is not enough to consider staying away, it is worth noting that the pizza comes in one size only, 11 inches, so no option for getting just slices and not really something that you would have enough left over to take home. We actually had a piece of pizza left and decided it was better to throw it out than bother to take it home."}
{"text":"Flavor: Amazing!! Cheese Pull: Pretty good cheese pull, doesn't slide off the crust. Crust: Kind of like a cracker but this isn't delivery, this is the real deal. Plus, I love thin crust. Price: Fair. Cold Test: Ate my pie before it got cold. Next day test: It didn't last that long.  Overall: Try it, you can make it however you want it."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  I had lunch there today and took advantage of their \"tax day\" special.  The people that work there were really great, everyone I came in contact with, had a smile and was very courteous.  This may be my new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Great idea, good price, great topping selections, but the actual pizza sucks. Unless you like the pizza on a cracker with no crust thing."}
{"text":"Pizza is muy Bueno!!!!¡¡¡¡ salads, not so much, in my opinion. Otherwise, fast and friendly service, clean nice place."}
{"text":"New find. Couldn't be more excited. Gluten free and regular crust options, heaven on earth. Fabulous specials and tons of options. Create your own pizza fired in front of your eyes. Great service and delicious food, so far no complaints but I will be back for continued updates.."}
{"text":"As a fast-serve pizza joint, this place ranks fairly well. The pizzas are delicious, yet the process has room for improvement. Understandably, the location serves the large local hospital staff, and can get packed fairly quickly. This location ran out of beef on our visit and we had to wait a bit for our order.  Nice for a quicky lunch, but not the top of my list."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Thin crust. Tasty sauce. Real cheese. Very good selection of fresh topping choices. If there is a line it moves rather quickly. I'd recommend to anybody who likes pizza. I bring family and friends here visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing. If you haven't ate here it's very recommended ! Not only its a personal sized pizza for yourself but you can make it anyway you want it ! You ask what about the toppings ? You can put what you want and how much ever you want ! Mmmmm my kind of place ! I will trick out my pizza every time ! It never gets old as you can make your pizza different every time ! They are opening more and more locations as we keep visiting the central phx location . Well stop reading and go enjoy I know I'm about too ."}
{"text":"Love how fresh this pizza joint is. Many ingredients to choose from including different sauces and cheeses for your pizza. It is set up like a sub shop but instead they offer great tasting pizza. Dough is thin and I noticed they offer gluten free as well as regular. They offer salads as well. Casual dining area with lots of people carrying out as we were waiting. Different than most places the staff here was very friendly and genuine. We will return!"}
{"text":"Really surprised by this place!  Being inside an outlet mall I was questioning the quality, however, the made to order pizza and salads were a pleasant surprise!  They were fast and the quality for the price was great!  Our family of four enjoyed two pizzas, a salad and beverages (husband and I shared a glass of wine) and the quantity for the price was great!  The crisp crust was delicious and the beef and bleu pizza was amazing!  We chose to enjoy the outdoor patio with our group of 15 and it was lovely!  Fast order-to-table service!  Will definitely make a stop here again if we happen to be near a location!"}
{"text":"I debated on writing this review for awhile. But I finally decided that I should.   This was my first time trying Fired Pie. Love the concept of customizing your own pizza so I thought I'd give a whirl. Ordered the Steak and Blue pizza, salad, and tea. I was the only customer there so I figured why not dine in?!   Mistake. A mentally disturbed individual wandered into the restaurant just as I was taking my first few bites of pizza and salad. I had picked a table in a corner out of view of the counter. But, as I mentioned, it was slow and I was the only person in there. I hoped he would just walk up to the counter, but he didn't. He decided to come straight to me and ask me for a cigarette. I advised him that I didn't smoke. I prayed he would just walk out. Instead he decided to sit next to me. The whole time I wondered where the employees were and if they would come to help. They didn't. There were three females working at the time.   He then asked me if God smoked. I told him I wasn't sure. The next question he asked me made me freeze. He asked me, \"Did I really kill someone?\"  I was uncomfortable before, but now I feared for my safety. Again, I wondered where the workers were and why no one had come out to check on me. I decided to stand up and leave. The first place I looked was at the counter for the employees. I saw one worker look out at me from the back part of their kitchen. Really?! While I'm not easily shaken, it was upsetting to think that the three of them were hiding in the back leaving me alone up front with a crazy man. I packed up my food as quickly as possible and left.   While I understand a business can't control who comes into their establishment, they CAN control what happens in their store.  I started to make excuses for the three females that were working. But then a realized, I shouldn't have to. A business is responsible for making their guests feel safe and comfortable while they are there. Obviously, the employees working that day did a poor job. That's a training/management issue. They should provide them with training on how to handle a situation like that so they are empowered to take action.   So while the food was amazing, I feel compelled to give them one star. I hope my unfortunate situation will be able to provide a training opportunity for them so this doesn't happen to someone else."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but enjoy the similar concept of MOD Pizza much better. Prices were fair, but was told that the more toppings I had on the pizza (endless topping concept) that you would get a spare amount, which I wasn't too fond of. All in all, I probably won't come back here, but I gave it a shot! I would suggest trying MOD if we are to be honest!"}
{"text":"What separates Fired Pie from the other Chipotle-esque pizza joints is its use of highly fresh ingredients and my favorite part, the crispy crust.  Let me dive into the crust first, because that is what will make your experience memorable.  When you bite into the crust, it's like biting into a thin shell of fire roasted pizza dough.  Combine that awesome crust and the fresh toppings of your choice and you got yourself an amazing pizza that was made within 10 minutes.  Speaking of toppings, there is a range of options, from different meats and vegetables.    If you are like me, I like my pizza mostly simple--2 vegetables and 2 meats and a sprinkle of garlic and basil to top it off.  If you are hungry, you can easily finish 1 whole pizza.  I'm reviewing just the pizza this first time and will provide updates as I try other items in the near future.  *Grand Opening Review*"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the friendly, helpful staff on our first visit. Our daughter is allergic to wheat, so she orders gluten free wherever she goes. While making her pizza, they offered to put on fresh gloves. Our daughter loved the gluten free herb crust - said it was the best pizza she'd ever had. My husband and I shared Margherita and Hawaiian pizzas. Both were very good, especially the Hawaiian. We will be eating here regularly!"}
{"text":"Luigi the General Manager was very friendly and accommodating to our vegan diet.   Great service, great food and perfect convenient location with outdoor seating l!  The pizza was amazing!  I can't say enough nice things about Fired Pie, specifically this location."}
{"text":"I've found my perfect pizza: oil and garlic sauce, all their cheeses, kalamata olives and more crushed garlic. It's like a date-crasher meal, if I ever went on dates. But it is still phenomenal, and makes me happy for hours afterward.  They also have a cookie pie that comes with a scoop of ice cream. I skip the ice cream and just tear into that fresh baked cookie dough (sometimes before I eat my pizza, because I'm crazy that way)."}
{"text":"I love it here! My kids loved picking out what they wanted on their pizzas and basically seeing it made in front of them! Really great food, too."}
{"text":"Fired is right down the street from my office and continues off the custom personal pizza concept. The pizzas taste pretty good and their gluten-free pizza crust is more doughy and doesn't have the cardboard consistency that some other places do. The service is always friendly and quick, even during the lunch rush. The reason it's 4 stars for me is because my first exposure to the concept was Pieology (-- BIG fan, their mission statement should be \"making fatboy pizza dreams reality\")."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Fired Pie that I've been to. Most Fired Pies I've been to have lacked customer service and quality in food. I'm not a picky person and rarely give reviews. However, the experience at this place was outstanding! The cashier Lexi was so sweet and speedy! Meanwhile the woman who made our food made me and my sister laugh and related well with us! Also I really appreciated the action behind the man who called our order, he wasted no time at all! He even called our name while walking with the pizza to find us, which I've never seen at another location! Shout out to the management here, and the employees for valuing your fellow customer!"}
{"text":"A Chipotle like pizza place.  All the different ingredients you want on your pizza for under 8 bucks.    Way better quality and end product than the usual suspect pizza places.  Not the best place to be when its crowded (line gets really slow), but for the price it can't be beat."}
{"text":"I enjoy Fired Pie. I like how the pizza is freshly made right in front of you and baked in minutes.  I have never selected their suggested pizza options and prefer to go rogue. I start with a combo of the white sauce and presto as my base. Then, I pick toppings as a look at the choices and depends on my mood...and cheese... always extra cheese. My topping technique leads to a unique pizza every time, but always delicious...."}
{"text":"Good pizza and excellent and short waiting time. Laid back and casual ambience. Not very busy during the dinner rush hour too."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  I was a bit leery about making my own pizza subway-style but as I chose all my toppings that I wanted on my pizza, I sat and waited.  They called out my name and the pizza looked impressive.  It was more of a thin-crust pizza and when I took a bite, I was won over!  My pizza tasted just the way I had hoped.  I will definitely be coming back again as this place is literally blocks from my work."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The concept is just like Chipotle or Subway.  Pick your pie or make one of the suggested ones on the menu.  The pizza is so good! I always order a pizza with mozzarella and fresh mozzarella with pepperoni, mushrooms, garlic, and light onions.  The staff is friendly and the pizza gets baked in their oven. Since it is thin crust, it doesn't take long to bake at all.  It's $7.95 which I think is a great deal for a personal size pizza.  They also have salads there, too."}
{"text":"My manager loves this place, and when he found out I never had it he immediately offered to buy me one if that right there doesn't tell you something.  I thought it was really cool that I got to pick the toppings myself and regardless of what I got it was the same price. I chose all my classic favorite topping I'm a pretty boring person when it comes to pizza.  The moment had come I had the box in my hand I opened it. The pizza smelt amazing then the first bite cam the crust was crispy and delicious mmm I will definitely get this pizza again."}
{"text":"This is the best thin crust pizza i've had in a long time.  I'm always skeptical going into a place for a pizza but this place rocked. The crust was cooked perfectly.  A big plus is that they are around the corner and there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because of a recommendation of my coworkers.  They didn't mean any harm.  The place is like a Subway pizza place.  I am adventurous so I tried it.  The price is cheap therefore the quality is the same.  The crust is the problem.  I got it to go.  If I had gulped it down after it came out of the oven, my review might be different, but I  didn't. The crust didn't hold up, it was soggy.  Tortino's  store bought crust is better."}
{"text":"I received a complimentary free pizza and salad coupon one day. So I went in and tried the salad first. It was a good size salad and it was very delicious! Then I tried the pizza a few weeks later. I had the Steak and Blue, it was the best pizza I've had!  This place rocks! I would highly recommend it! I will be back."}
{"text":"My son suggested we meet them here for pizza. We got there early and I had my doubts as to whether I would like it or not. But my son has always guided me to new good places.  This is a build your own pizza place. When everyone was there we went up to the order line and had them build the pizza of our choice. When I was the pizza dough I thought this is not going to be good. (Surprise Surprise) One of the best crusts I have had. Thin the way I like it. The flavor does not get lost in the excess dough some places insist on using. I know everyone enjoyed their pizza. This is definitely a visit many times place.  The people working there were nice, patient and helpful.  The only negative is..........comfort. Most people just come in to order and leave. It was like sitting on patio furniture and trying to eat off a table. Not that bad but kinda. Any how I will be back but probably to one closer to my house.  If you like thin crust pizza and you like to choose what is on your pizza this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love the garlic sauce, and the pesto sauce. Super flavorful. Also love that they serve fresh mozzarella. This is my favorite place to get pizza (out of MOD & Blaze) but I don't go as often because they have terrible drink options, and their lemonade is the worst thing to happen to mankind.   Also, please stop serving your pazookies. I don't think the staff knows what they are because they ALWAYS forget to give it to you.   But overall, do give it a try. Very good pizza!"}
{"text":"One super important thing for me is gluten free options and even though their gluten free crust is slightly smaller than their normal crust despite having to pay a couple dollars extra for it, it's definitely worth it! Love their pizza and their different base sauce options! They have a good selection of toppings and staff is usually nice. My go to pizza place when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"One knows what to expect from yet another quick service pizza establishment like this. Mediocre ingredients prepared and baked to their understanding of \"doneness\", by that i mean the \"pookie\" i redeemed from a yelp deal was only partially cooked.. how does one get a refund on a promotional item? The pizza was edible.. no complaints on that.  Watch out for the burgundy/red head girl with a major attitude issue.. if you don't give her your completed list of toppings that you desire on your pizza she will get all bent out of shape.  If you would like to have a completely enjoyable experience without being a victim of bent-betty's bad day, go to the Fired Pie off the 10 freeway on Ray rd."}
{"text":"Call it the \"Subway\" of fast pizza. You tell them what you want on your pizza as they slide it thru the sauce,  meats and veggies and then they throw it in the oven and it is cooked within 5 minutes.   Would recommend building your own pizza and don't be shy to tell them you want more of a certain topping.  I generally pile on the meats and ask for double sausage and pepperoni because after it gets cooked the toppings.  This seems to be the trend of the direction of pizza but is good for fast food pizza.   I will certainly come back and enjoy the fact that you can customize your own pizza."}

I generally pile on the meats and ask for double sausage and pepperoni because after it gets cooked the toppings shrink.  This particular location is in a great area but not visible to Scottsdale Road nor barely to Hayden/Greenway Road which is probably why every previous business has failed there.

{"text":"I enjoyed going to this Fired Pie until today. I usually get a pizza to go shortly before they close, when nobody is in the restaurant and it is quiet inside. Today was different. I went into Fired Pie on Saturday at around 6 P.M. when the restaurant was busy. There was a large party being loud in the very middle of the restaurant and music was playing in the background. I go up to the counter to order and I cannot hear anything the girl is asking me. She was soft-spoken and short. I am short as well and it felt like we had a glass wall between us. I politely asked her to repeat herself. It was awkward and uncomfortable, but heaven forbid, I just could not hear the girl. Plus, I have been there only a handful times and I do not have their assembly line process down yet, so I had no clue what she was asking. As the girl is repeating herself in her soft voice, another employee behind the counter raises her voice at me and, in an impatient and condescending way, shouts what the other girl had been saying. This is in front of other customers behind me and in front of all of the other employees behind the counter. People turned their heads as this woman barked at me. It was humiliating and unnecessary. Their pizza is good, but I will not be going to this location anymore. What an embarrassing and awkward experience."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a bit sad to see the previous restaurant that was in this space (Pellini) go. However, Fired Pie was quite an enjoyable lunch experience, so I'll certainly cope just fine coming here instead.   I'd seen a few other Fired Pies around town, so seeing a local franchise grow a bit more is kinda a neat thing. The whole setup is pretty ideal, having a fixed price for a custom pizza or salad is a great idea as we all hate getting nickeled and dimed (or dollared) for adding toppings. And for something that gets baked in an actual fired oven, it's pretty darn quick. I had my pizza in under 5 minutes.   The place is comfortable, clean, fairly priced, and has ample seating, even around lunch time. In all, $10 for a tasty personal pizza drink made for an enjoyable visit. I'll certainly be back. Can't really find anything to complain about here, perhaps I'll update my review the more I dine here."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, lots of fresh toppings and completely customizable. It's all included in the one price. Everyone was nice and the pizza was ready super quick. If you want pizza or salad only, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow!  Not only does Fired Pie offer an exceptional value, but they create some of the best pizzas in the Valley.  Saying that it's the gourmet pizza version of Subway cheapens the truly wonderful experience my wife and I had, but that's the best description of their ordering process that I can drum up at this point.    I ordered the Steak & Blue Pizza and added jalapenos.  The dough, meat, cheese and veggies were superb.  My wife's Meaty Italian was equally delicious and we also split an excellent Fired Italian Salad.  I can't think of a spot that offers an $8 11 inch gourmet pizza.  Additionally, eating gourmet pizza has always meant having to sit down at a restaurant., but that is no longer the only way to enjoy high quality, thin crust pizza.    The price, quality and myriad ingredients means that I will be back to try my own pizza inventions next week and probably every week after that!  **Tip 1**  The serve beer and wine, but my thirst for a lot of wine with my gourmet concoctions means it's worth taking the pizza to go!  **Tip 2**  I think it's a little hard to find Fired Pie from Ray Rd.  Keep your eyes open for the Whole Foods sign instead.  **Tip 3**  I usually get a cup for water with my food at any fast food joint, BUT Fired Pie offers up 4 different unsweetened ice tea flavors that are all fantastic and an Acai Berry Vitamin Water drink too.  It's worth splurging!"}
{"text":"Yay!  A solid option for a vegan! Fired Pie is a fast food place with a \"create your own\" pizza and salad line, similar to a Subway or Chipotle restaurant. They have vegan cheese and a variety of veggies.  I got a super tasty vegan pizza in a very timely manner for less than $9.  I would come back here."}
{"text":"They have gluten-free crust and the employees will offer to change their gloves, but there are no gluten-free ingredients. The pizza by itself tasted great, but the employees seem to get confused if you do your own pizza. The gentleman bussing the tables was much more friendly and helpful as he provided us with parmesan cheese and a box for the leftover pizza."}
